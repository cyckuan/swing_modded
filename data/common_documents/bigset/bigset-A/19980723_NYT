WELL-READ _ JUST NOT FOM THAT LIST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL GOODYKOONTZ  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Seventeen out of 100? This is ridiculous.
</P>
<P>
   When the list of the 20th century's greatest novels in English
came out Monday, cries of dissent quickly followed.
</P>
<P>
   Not enough women writers, some critics carped (only eight books
by women made the list). Too many Americans and Brits, others cried
(aside from James Joyce, who has three books on it, the list
included no other works by English-speaking writers from outside
the U.S. and Britain).
</P>
<P>
   Others found the list arrogant, including the person who posted
this missive on the ``New York Times'' book forum the day the list
was released:
</P>
<P>
   ``I just glanced. What a joke . . . what a bleeping joke. . . .
I've never wanted to be as profane on these forums as I want to be
now. I couldn't read past the first 10. . . . These people are . .
. well, I won't say idiots. . . . Oh, bleep. Intellectual snobs.''
</P>
<P>
   Worthy complaints, all. Well, maybe not that last one. But none
is the one that I first found with the list, and I'll bet many
people shared the same sentiment:
</P>
<P>
   It makes me feel stupid.
</P>
<P>
   Which is another way of saying I haven't read nearly enough of
the books on the list.
</P>
<P>
   I like to think I'm a good reader. I've never done more than
look at the cover of a bodice ripper. I've never once allowed
myself to read a John Grisham potboiler. Yet all of a sudden, I
feel like I ought to look for books in airports instead of
libraries. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   EXCUSES, EXCUSES
</P>
<P>
   I allowed myself a few justifications. This kind of list doesn't
mean anything, anyway (a list released Tuesday by publishing
students at Radcliffe College was far different). The list is
nothing more than a marketing tool for Random House's Modern
Library, whose editorial board compiled it (Random House is going
to place promotional material in bookstores offering novels from
the list). It gives short shrift to modern writers, whose books I
am more likely to read.
</P>
<P>
   Some or all of which may be true. But it does nothing to change
the fact that I have read only 17 of the top 100. (I've cracked six
or seven others but never finished them.)
</P>
<P>
   The trouble starts at the top. I've never finished ``Ulysses,''
by James Joyce, the No. 1 pick. I own it. I've started it. I know
what it's about. I've just never gotten all the way through it.
</P>
<P>
   I'm batting a weak .300 for the top 10: I've read only ``The
Great Gatsby,'' by F. Scott Fitzgerald, ``The Sound and the
Fury,''by William Faulkner, and ``The Grapes of Wrath,'' by John
Steinbeck.
</P>
<P>
   More embarrassingly, I've never even HEARD of some of the books,
such as ``A Dance to the Music of Time,'' by Anthony Powell, or ``A
House for Ms. Biswas,'' by V.S. Naipaul. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   `MASH' FINALE
</P>
<P>
   Whenever i went over the list with other people, comparing our
shortcomings, I felt mostly shame, interrupted by the occasional
burst of pride. When we would finally get to a book I'd read, I
automatically said something along the lines of, ``Man, that was a
good one,'' even if I hadn't much liked it.
</P>
<P>
   I was reminded of an old ``Peanuts'' cartoon, in which Lucy Van
Pelt walks around the neighborhood reading a book, telling everyone
who will listen how great it is. In fact, she says, it's the best
book she's ever read. Finally, Violet asks, ``What other books have
you read?''
</P>
<P>
   She lowers the book from her face, and answers, ``This is the
only one.''
</P>
<P>
   One friend had read nine of the top 10, ``but I only understood
three of them.'' A story about the list quoted the writer Cynthia
Ozick; she claims to have read 90.
</P>
<P>
   The path is clear: I must resolve to read more of these books.
I've got to finish the ones I've started. I have to spend more time
improving my mind by reading and less time on such empty pursuits
as watching television and wasting time on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   And I will. The minute this ``MASH'' rerun is over.

MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN FUNDING BYPASS NEEDY INDIAN TRIBES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF BARKER  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Hundreds of millions of dollars a year in funding
for Indian social programs are bypassing the very tribes that need
the money most, congressional auditors reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The General Accounting Office found that wealthy tribes with
revenues of more than $100 million a year are, in at least a
handful of cases, receiving more federal dollars than the neediest
tribes for child welfare, law enforcement and other critical needs.
</P>
<P>
   The accounting office, in its 47-page report, did not name the
wealthiest tribes or evaluate whether the arrangement was fair. But
it did suggest that things would be different if the Bureau of
Indian Affairs revised an outdated funding formula to account for
Indian gaming, which was approved by Congress in 1988. While most
of the nation's 556 federally recognized tribes are below the
poverty line, a minority have gotten rich off gaming.
</P>
<P>
   Now it appears the rich tribes are getting richer, partly at
government expense.
</P>
<P>
   One tribe, the Mashantucket Pequot of Connecticut, has been
making more than $1 million a day from its vast Foxwoods Casino. At
the same time, the government is giving the tribe $385,000 for
basic tribal services.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as it continues to use a funding distribution method
that is relatively static, . . . BIA has no assurance that its
current (funding) distribution is most effectively meeting the
needs of tribes,'' the accounting office stated.
</P>
<P>
   In response, BIA said that federal Indian policy did not require
it to reduce funding to rich tribes to help the poor.
</P>
<P>
   Some Arizona tribes fear Congress might use the report as
ammunition to unfairly penalize reservations with profitable
casinos. Sixteen Arizona tribes have gaming compacts with the
state.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Slade Gorton, R-Wash., who requested the study, has already
moved to redistribute funding for the program that was the focus of
the report. The program, known as Tribal Priority Allocations,
provides $757 million a year for the most basic tribal services
such as police, child welfare and adult job training.
</P>
<P>
   Gorton has introduced a plan that would take half of the TPA
money from the wealthiest 10 percent of tribes, based on their
business revenue, and give it to the poorest 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Because there is no ranking of tribes according to revenue, it
is unclear how Gorton's bill would affect Arizona Indians. Still,
some Arizona tribes are concerned.
</P>
<P>
   The White Mountain Apache Tribe, for example, said in a
statement Wednesday that Gorton's plan ignores sovereign rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tribe views the proposal as unfairly singling out tribes
for means-testing and penalizes those tribes that have successful
programs that, if they had been accomplished by state and local
governments, would be rewarded with continued federal funding,''
the tribe said.
</P>
<P>
   The tribe, which has a casino, also said Gorton seems to forget
that the United States signed treaties with many tribes that
included unconditional promises for future aid.
</P>
<P>
   ``The intent wasn't to quietly overlook treaty obligations.
That's not the intent at all,'' said Cynthia Bergman, Gorton's
press secretary. ``The whole intent is to target money toward
poorer tribes. This is all based now on historical funding, and
there's no rhyme or reason to it.'' &QL;

MURDER (Phoenix) - Before Dominique Keys shot her husband dead
Tuesday afternoon, the British couple twice tried to sell his
serial killer confession story to tabloid magazines. But British
police say the murder story is complete rubbish, and now she's the
one facing first-degree murder charges. By CHRISTINA LEONARD. Story
will move in the ``A'' category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
TRIBES (Washington) - More than $750 million in federal dollars for
Indian social programs isn't being targeted to the tribes needing
it the most, congressional auditors report. The General Accounting
Office found that tribes making millions of dollars from casinos
are, in some cases, receiving more funding than poor tribes for
child welfare, law enforcement and other critical needs. But some
Indians view the report, requested by Sen. Slade Gorton, R-Wash.,
as an assault on tribes that have finally lifted themselves out of
poverty through gaming revenues. By JEFF BARKER. Story will move in
the ``A'' category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
CAR DEALERS (Phoenix) - Arizona dealers in General Motors cars and
trucks find supplies on vehicles and mostly parts getting tight,
though it's not as bad in Arizona as it is in some other parts of
the country. The hot-selling Suburbans and Yukons are gone, in some
cases, and customers' cars are stacking up waiting for parts. Worse
is the public perception that dealers are out of cars entirely or
trying to gouge customers for scarce vehicles, resulting in empty
showrooms and and lax sales for July. By BOB GOLFEN. Story will
move in the ``A'' category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
ABORTION-CLINIC (Phoenix) - The A-Z abortion clinic that employed
Dr. John Biskind is reportedly closing its doors, as are two other
Phoenix area clinics owned by the same New York doctor. The clinics
apparently can't keep any docs or staff members. Meanwhile,
patients' appointments are being canceled and they are being told
to go elsewhere. By SUSIE STECKNER and JODIE SNYDER. Story will
move in the ``A`` category.  &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
SPIELBERG-MOVIE (Undated) -Steven Spielberg's latest creation,
``Saving Private Ryan,'' is a shock to the system. The battle
scenes contain some of the rawest footage of what it looks like
when human bodies are ripped apart by machine gun fire. ``This is
only a glance at what they had to endure on that beach and live
with for the rest of their lives,'` Spielberg explained. ``I
intended to make the most realistic war film ever.'` Republic
critic Bob Fenster interviews Spielberg, Tom Hanks and Matt Damon.

 &QL; 
SAVING RYAN-MOVIE (Undated) - War movies fracture along the fault
lines of combat: bravery and cowardice, the quick and the dead,
mission and madness, the officers who give tough orders and the men
on the ground who die carrying them out. ``Saving Private Ryan''
leaves us shaken along all those fault lines. You would not want it
more intense. You may not want it this intense. 5 stars. EMBARGOED

EDITORIAL: A STRANGE TIMES SQUARE 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Thursday, July 23:
</P>
<P>
   First off, it doesn't sound right. Silence in mid-city alerts
the senses the way a loud noise unnerves people in the country.
Here we are at the center of the universe, or more precisely at the
center of our universe, and there are no cars lurching, no taxis
honking, nobody begging quarters or selling cut-rate silk ties or
chanting ``excuse me'' as he shoulders through the tourists.
</P>
<P>
   Times Square without traffic or New Year's revelers feels not
only empty but barren, like some big-city version of the deserted
American Main Street where store windows are black and traffic
lights blink at nobody. Manhattan's Main Street, of course, cannot
be entirely vacant after the scaffolding sagged and then fell from
a construction site on Tuesday morning, killing one person and
injuring a dozen. There will be maintenance crews, ambulances and
fire trucks, all trying to ward off a nasty aftershock from a tower
that could at any moment scatter debris throughout the theater
district.
</P>
<P>
   The tides of workers and tourists moved in new currents on
Wednesday, surging from a distance of several blocks to as close as
a few hundred feet from the accident, their paths detailed by a row
of barricades punctuated every few yards by a police officer.
Tourists took it in stride, subtracting plans to see ``Cabaret,''
which was playing at a theater nearly beneath the bad scaffolding,
and adding the crosswalks at 43d Street, where the distant tower
looks like a Lego construction that has been kicked in its
midsection by a frustrated child.
</P>
<P>
   New Yorkers also adapted, but not always so easily. At 43d and
Fifth Avenue, a policeman was informing an earnest young man on
Wednesday that his bank was not open. ``Why not?'' the New Yorker
snorted, as the unstable tower shimmered in the background heat a
block and a half away. Only a New Yorker would ask such a question.
Nobody needs Chicken Little to know that our skyline is always
falling, shedding bits and pieces like some inanimate equalizer on
high. A chunk of Yankee Stadium, a building facade, a deadly brick,
a subway ceiling _ these dangers force New Yorkers to play a kind
of daily survival Lotto. Now, for a few days at least, the dangers
have rearranged the city center itself.

`RYAN' CAP TURES WAR'S IN TENSITY, EMOTION  
 (EMBARGOED FOR RELEASE FRIDAY, JULY 24) 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB FENSTER  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED - War movies fracture along the fault lines of combat:
bravery and cowardice, the quick and the dead, mission and madness,
the officers who give tough orders and the men on the ground who
die carrying them out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Saving Private Ryan'' leaves us shaken along all those fault
lines with men who had no choice but to endure what military
historian Stephen Ambrose calls ``the inevitability of combat.''
</P>
<P>
   In his attempt to create the intense reality of battle under
heavy weapons fire, director Steven Spielberg makes ``Saving
Private Ryan'' one of the most realistic and heartbreaking war
stories ever filmed.
</P>
<P>
   You would not want it more intense. You may not want it this
intense.
</P>
<P>
   The story begins on D-Day, June 6, 1944, off-shore of Omaha
Beach, with a company of Rangers landing into the mouths of German
machine guns.
</P>
<P>
   Men die by the score. Bodies are ripped apart. Hope is buried
under an endless fusillade.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers' attempts to reach shore, to move up the beach, to
survive the day form the most graphically intense battle sequence
yet filmed of modern warfare. It is a scene that would be the
climax of most war movies.
</P>
<P>
   It is only the beginning of ``Saving Private Ryan.''
</P>
<P>
   The movie then follows one squad of survivors, led by Captain
Miller (Tom Hanks), as they are given a FUBAR mission. Veterans
will recognize that military slang; others will learn its meaning
as the movie progresses.
</P>
<P>
   Miller and his men are sent forward into enemy territory to find
and bring back one soldier, Private James Ryan (Matt Damon).
</P>
<P>
   Why Ryan? His four brothers have been killed in action. Since he
is the sole surviving son, the brass want him sent home, as a
symbol of their efforts to save the American family from being
wiped out by the ferocious onslaught of World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Miller's men realize they are being asked to risk their lives on
a PR mission, and they don't like it.
</P>
<P>
   That squad includes:
</P>
<P>
   _Private Reiben (Ed Burns), a veteran of too many battles who is
smart enough to realize how stupid they are for taking the mission.
</P>
<P>
   _Sergeant Horvath (Tom Sizemore), who collects a canister of
dirt from every country he fights through.
</P>
<P>
   _Private Jackson (Barry Pepper), the sniper who takes a
spiritual approach to battle.
</P>
<P>
   _Corporal Upham (Jeremy Davies), an interpreter who is so new to
battle that he thinks there are rules of right and wrong under
combat.
</P>
<P>
   As they gripe their way across the killing fields of France to
find Ryan, director Spielberg paints a grimly realistic picture of
how land wars are fought minute by minute, how a small group of men
with a limited view of the mission and the cause for which they
will die, cling only to the slim hopes of survival and loyalty to
the men on either side of them.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from Hanks and Damon, who represent the goodness and hope
of the men nations send off to die, most of the actors are
unfamiliar or rarely seen faces.
</P>
<P>
   This casting adds to the film's sense of authenticity, depicting
ordinary men caught up in extraordinary circumstances from which
they cannot extricate themselves and so must push forward against
their better judgment.
</P>
<P>
   Hanks and the entire cast capture the sensibilities of GIs from
any era, portraying their reluctant heroism in the face of constant
fear.
</P>
<P>
   Dramatically, Spielberg has set himself an interesting dilemma:
The opening battle is so intense that the rest of the film cannot
rise in intensity from that level. The battle for Omaha Beach could
have been a movie unto itself.
</P>
<P>
   Spielberg deals with this dramatic quandary by taking the story
back down to a more intimate portrait of eight men who have no way
out but to march into doom.
</P>
<P>
   That shift in focus will work for some people, but it may leave
others wondering if they're watching the movie backward.
</P>
<P>
   What should catch everyone is Spielberg's attention to detail
and his ability to capture the frenzied panic of ground battles.
</P>
<P>
   Does he go too far in his efforts to shock with graphic
violence? Yes, he goes as far as a movie can go to re-create the
sights and sounds of actual battle.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Big Red One,'' ''Platoon'' and ``Hamburger Hill'' took a
similar approach in their grim depictions of the way heavy weapons
fire can tear apart the human body with indiscriminate dis patch.
</P>
<P>
   But ``Saving Private Ryan'' is even more intense then those
excellent war films because of advances in special effects and
Spielberg's greater command of the emotional uses to which those
effects can be put.
</P>
<P>
   Spielberg stays right on the ground with his squad, on one
narrow strip of beach, in one shell-shattered town, with eight
soldiers fighting through the only war they have: the one
surrounding them on all sides.
</P>
<P>
   It's a fascinating way to create an epic, not going wide like
``Patton,'' ''The Longest Day'' or ``A Bridge Too Far,'' but going
much deeper. In so doing, he honors ordinary soldiers, survivors
and fallen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Saving Private Ryan'' takes up a position with a short list of
other films that showed a realistic view of soldiers sent out to
die on impossible missions: ``All Quiet on the Western Front,''
``Paths of Glory,'' ``The Sands of Iwo Jima, ``Pork Chop Hill,''
``The Steel Helmet,'' ``A Walk in the Sun,'' ``Hamburger Hill.``
</P>
<P>
   These movies are not about the adventure of soldiering, but
about the price paid by the people trapped in war.
</P>
<P>
   Spielberg has brilliantly posed the questions of why men die to
save other men, of why they follow orders, of how bravery is
attained and how a sense of purpose can emerge from the chaos of
war.
</P>
<P>
   Is ``Saving Private Ryan'' too in tense for kids? Obviously. It
should, however, be required viewing for generals and politicians.
Give them something to think about before they start the next war.
</P>
<P>
   ``Saving Private Ryan'' is rated R for its graphic violence and
heavy profanity. 5 stars. &QL;

JUDGE VOIDS BAN ON PORN FOR JAILED SEX OFFENDERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWARK, N.J. _ A federal judge struck down a law Wednesday that
had banned sexually oriented material for inmates at the state's
prison for chronic sex offenders, saying that the law's sweeping
language was unconstitutional and that the state had failed to
prove that such a ban would help rehabilitate the prisoners.
</P>
<P>
   The judge, Alfred Wolin of U.S. District Court in Newark, had
blocked the state from enforcing the law June 29, warning that he
was likely to rule in favor of two inmates who filed a lawsuit to
overturn the measure. But he refrained from issuing a final ruling
at that time, saying he wanted to give the state attorney general's
office another chance to argue the law's merits.
</P>
<P>
   But state lawyers, who had argued that the ban would help
rehabilitate prisoners, chose not to expand their defense of the
law. In his decision Wednesday, Wolin rebuked state lawmakers for
writing legislation so sloppy that in addition to banning
pornographic literature, photographs and other material, it could
also prohibit inmates ``from reading the Bible, fashion magazines,
books, legal documents and sections of newspapers.''
</P>
<P>
   Wolin said he did not believe that state legislators wrote the
law intending to help rehabilitate sex offenders at the prison, the
Adult Diagnostic and Treatment Center in Avenel. He noted that the
state Department of Corrections initially opposed the ban, saying
it would not help rehabilitate prisoners. ``The true reason for the
enactment'' of the law, Wolin wrote, ``appears to be public outrage
over some of the heinous, pedophiliac crimes that occurred in New
Jersey.''
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview, state Attorney General Peter Verniero
said his office had decided not to try to persuade Wolin after the
earlier decision, but would appeal the latest ruling. ``We made a
strategic decision to move on in an expedited fashion to the Court
of Appeals,'' Verniero said. ``In light of the judge's strongly
worded earlier decision, I did not believe it was in anyone's best
interest, not least of which the taxpayers', to prolong the
District Court's proceedings.''
</P>
<P>
   Wolin's decision made it clear that he found himself in the
unenviable position of having to rule in favor of convicted sex
offenders abhorred by society. ``The court reiterates that it is
sensitive to society's concern and interest in defending against
and punishing sex offenders,'' he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   But, he said later in his decision, ``This court has a sworn
duty to uphold the Constitution against all competing interests.''
He concluded: ``Here, the fault lies not with the prisoners who
seek freedom of expression, but with an ill-considered and
ill-conceived law that deprives them of that freedom. A law born in
haste merits an equally speedy demise.''
</P>
<P>
   The law, which Gov. Christie Whitman signed in January, was
passed unanimously by both houses of the Legislature. The bill grew
out of a visit to the Avenel prison in 1995 by a state task force
studying repeat offense rates among child molesters and the
effectiveness of treatment programs at Avenel. During a tour, some
task force members said, they were stunned to see pictures of naked
women and copies of sexually explicit magazines in some cells.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly all of Avenel's 750 inmates have committed sex offenses
at least twice and have been classified by judges as ``repetitive
and compulsive'' offenders.
</P>
<P>
   In defending the ban, the state argued that sexually explicit
materials hinder rehabilitation. But counselors and other experts
who work with sex offenders are divided on the issue. In some
cases, experts say, sexually explicit material may help child
molesters redirect their sexual feelings toward adults.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit to overturn the ban was brought by Richard Waterman,
41, who is serving a 54-year prison term for sexually assaulting a
9-year-old girl in Ventnor in 1991, and by Michael Curtis, 56, who
is serving a 20-year sentence after his 1990 conviction for
sexually abusing a 14-year-old boy in Hopewell Township.
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence Lustberg, a court-appointed lawyer who represented the
inmates, applauded the judge. ``Judge Wolin followed the law and
his decision is a courageous one,'' Lustberg said. ``Obviously, he
is well aware of how unpopular it was.''  &QL;

   Slow to embrace &QL; 
home-run pace
</P>
<P>
   &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
THERE they are, Mark McGwire and Ken Griffey Jr., large-as-life
caricatures grinning away at us from the cover of Time, like they
were major international figures instead of mere major-leaguers.
</P>
<P>
   Space on the front of Time normally belongs to the Saddam
Husseins and the Monica Lewinskys of the world, not ballplayers.
Guess time _ and Time _ hasn't passed America's Pastime by after
all in this, another hot summer of ongoing absolution for the Great
Strike of '94-95.
</P>
<P>
   But personally, I'm troubled by their bloated assaults on the
home-run records of Babe Ruth and Roger Maris. It's bad enough that
Cal Ripken, Baltimore's Energizer Bunny, has devalued Lou Gehrig
into Tin Man status. Should both Big Mac and Junior now blow away
the tater barrier, too, especially if it happens simultaneously,
it's going to cheapen things further.
</P>
<P>
   And serve to remind us, as if we need it, how truly godawful the
pitching profession has become.
</P>
<P>
   Break record; don't shatter it
</P>
<P>
   Man was not meant to hit 70 homers in a single season, any more
than he's supposed to hit .500. Such outrageous numbers in said
categories can only damage ball, not enhance it over the long haul.
Gross variances from the norm only raise suspicion, rather than
alter accepted standards.
</P>
<P>
   Remember Bob Beamon? Rosie Ruiz? The Chinese swimmers?
</P>
<P>
   I'd like to see McGwire and/or Griffey _ no one else, though; it
gets too cluttered _ enter the final week with 59 or 60 and then
ultimately raise the bar but a hair, to 62 or 63. To obliterate
Maris' name from the record books would be to replace the asterisk
he carried to his grave with an even more glaring one.
</P>
<P>
   The truly dramatic scenario would be to have them reach 59 in,
say, 152 games, thereby painting a bull's eye on the Bambino's
rotund torso. Ruth's 60, smacked in the 154-game season of 1927,
remains the most magical of sports records, single-season variety.
</P>
<P>
   Less sexy but no less intriguing is Juan Gonzalez's testing the
RBI limits. With his five Tuesday night followed by three
Wednesday, the Texas Ranger has 113 in 100 games, on track to drive
home 183 over 162.
</P>
<P>
   Hack Wilson's 190 RBIs in 1930 equate to 200 in the modern
season. Gonzalez would have to push 90 runners across the plate in
his last 63 games to match. No reason to watch him too closely
quite yet, given that no player has surpassed 160 in 60 years.
</P>
<P>
   As for the .400 barrier, with Tony Gwynn's time apparently over,
that's not going to fall in our lifetime, either, having already
stood inviolate for 57 seasons. Night ball, pitching by committee
and a general lack of iron-willed, steely-eyed discipline on the
part of the modern hitter have conspired to make it the safest of
all batting thresholds.
</P>
<P>
   Among pitchers, that dying breed, there are virtually no records
made to be broken. Of those in 17 key single-season categories,
subtracting the strictly contemporary subgroup related to relief
pitching, only Orel Hershiser's 59 consecutive scoreless innings
and Nolan Ryan's 383 strikeouts have been posted since 1938. In the
career categories, it's pretty much the same story. I mean, Cy
Young won 511 games while pitching 300 or more innings 16 times,
something no pitcher may do again. When Don Sutton, with his 324
victories, entered the Hall of Fame, he went so far as to pronounce
himself the end of a species.
</P>
<P>
   ``I doubt very seriously,'' Sutton mused, ``that there will be
another 300-game winner.''
</P>
<P>
   Maddux on target
</P>
<P>
   Had he forgotten Greg Maddux, whose quiet pursuit of immortality
is infinitely more subtle, but no less enthralling, than the
crash-bam McGwire-Griffey show? Maddux is Truffaut to their
Tarantino.
</P>
<P>
   A young 32 and 13-4 at present, he has 197 W's and never has
been on the disabled list. At the same age, Sutton, Nolan Ryan and
Phil Niekro were well behind Maddux's pace, a pace that has seen
him average 17.5 wins per season over the last decade, a towering
achievement for the '90s.
</P>
<P>
   Another six seasons, assuming he keeps rolling this summer, and
he's there. Time _ if not Time, which makes references to his
``doughy'' body and ``nerdy'' glasses _ is strongly on his side,
Sutton's harrumphing notwithstanding.
</P>
<P>
   It's less of an ally for Roger Clemens, who got his 225th
victory Wednesday night. Rocket Roger is 34 with more wear and tear
on his arm, but you figure he'll be afforded the opportunity to
work for as long as he desires to propel a baseball toward home
plate.
</P>
<P>
   Didn't Danny Darwin, Grandpa Death, go against the Astros last
weekend? Such is the dearth of alternatives. While the nation
shouts ``bully!'' for Mac and Junior, I believe temperance is in
order. In truth, they're bullies, exploiting a bad situation.

LAWYER ASKS JURY TO SPARE LIFE OF CONVICTED KILLER 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   POUGHKEEPSIE, N.Y. _ The lawyer for Dalkeith McIntosh, a
convicted double murderer, pleaded Wednesday with jurors to save
his client's life.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyer, William Tendy, spent nearly an hour asking jury
members to consider the life of a man whose experiences could not
be further from their own. He graphically reiterated courtroom
testimony about the savage beatings McIntosh, 38, had endured as a
child in Jamaica, becoming so emotional at times that his voice
nearly broke.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, the same jury convicted McIntosh of killing his
wife and stepdaughter by shooting them in the head on Aug. 12,
1996. Because the jurors' verdict also said that McIntosh committed
the second murder to eliminate his stepdaughter as a witness _ both
to her mother's killing and to the attempted murder of a 6-year-old
boy during the same incident _ they made him eligible for death by
lethal injection.
</P>
<P>
   The jurors must be unanimous in their decision to impose the
death penalty or chose a sentence of life in prison without the
possibility of parole. If they are unable to agree on either
punishment, Judge George Marlow of Dutchess County Court will
impose a sentence of life in prison and make McIntosh eligible for
parole after he has served at least 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutor, Edward Whitesell, spoke for about 25 minutes,
arguing for death.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every single time he pulled the trigger, he made a choice,''
Whitesell said. ``Every single time, that choice was to put him
where he is today.''
</P>
<P>
   McIntosh ``made the death penalty the most fitting and
appropriate sentence in this case,'' the prosecutor said.
</P>
<P>
   Tendy, however, said death was inappropriate for McIntosh, an
indigent Jamaican immigrant of borderline intelligence, who had
endured a brutal childhood and a life of deprivation.
</P>
<P>
   ``This man is not Ted Bundy or Timothy McVeigh,'' said Tendy,
referring to a serial killer and the Oklahoma City bomber.
``There's got to be some compassion, somewhere deep down in your
hearts. There's got to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Whitesell did not dispute that McIntosh had led a life of
desperate hardship. He later admitted to feeling drained as the
trial neared a close.
</P>
<P>
   Tendy, who was visibly saddened when the guilty verdict was
announced on July 8, strove Wednesday to find arguments that might
persuade the jury to show mercy. He reminded them of the example of
Jesus, ``perhaps the most famous victim of capital punishment,''
and added: ``If He were alive today, would He be standing here
asking for this man's death? Of course not. He'd be saying,
`Blessed are the merciful.'''
</P>
<P>
   Tendy's final exhortation asked jurors to consider how they
would someday explain the case to their children.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tell them how tragic this was,'' he said. ``Tell them about
life in prison. Tell them about the death penalty. Tell them about
the power that you had. And when they look up and ask, `What did
you do?' Tell them, as proudly as you can, `I chose life.'''
</P>
<P>
   After an hour and a half of closing arguments and another hour
of instructions from Marlow, the jurors began to consider
McIntosh's sentence about 1:20 p.m. They retired for the evening at
about 6 without reaching a verdict.
</P>
<P>
   Deliberations are expected to continue on Thursday.

VENERABLE TOURNAMENT TAKING ITS LAST SWINGS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass.)  (lb) 
 By JACK CAVANAUGH   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In its 31-year-old history, there has never been a repeat winner
of the PGA Tour event at the Pleasant Valley Country Club in
Sutton, Mass. And unless one of the 14 former winners in the field
prevails at this year's tournament, which starts Thursday, there
never will be a two-time winner. The only PGA Tour stopover in
Massachusetts is going out of business.
</P>
<P>
   And with the launching next year of three ``World Golf
Championships,'' and another in 2000, each with $5 million in prize
money, the demise of the CVS Charity Classic in central
Massachusetts may turn out to be a harbinger for some other PGA
Tour events, particularly those in smaller markets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Other tournaments are definitely going to be squeezed out,''
said Ted Mingolla, the owner of Pleasant Valley.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tim Finchem, he said referring to the PGA tour commissioner,
``told us that they had to strengthen their markets and go to more
metropolitan areas.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been running this tournament for more than 30 years and
drawing very good crowds, too _ up to 150,000 over the four days.
But there's no loyalty shown by the PGA, no matter how long you've
been running a tournament. I've talked to about half the players in
our field and most of them are livid over what's happened to us.''
</P>
<P>
   Begun by Mingolla's father, Cuz, in 1965, the tournament has had
12 names and eight major sponsors along the way, but much of the
time, Mingolla said, ``we put up our own money.''
</P>
<P>
   CVS, the drugstore chain based in Woonsocket, R.I., became the
first title sponsor in 1996 but the company decided to pull out
upon learning that, starting in 1999, the tournament would be held
the week before the British Open for at least five years.
</P>
<P>
   ``CVS said no to that and asked for a fall date,'' Mingolla
said. ``But the only alternative they offered was the week in
August opposite the NEC World Series of Golf. Again, CVS said no,
since they knew we'd lose 30 or 40 of the top players.''
</P>
<P>
   In its determination to keep the tournament in Pleasant Valley,
Mingolla said, CVS offered to invest $3 million and to buy network
television time if the event were played in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``But they said no fall dates were available,'' Mingolla said of
the PGA's response, ``although it appears that some will be.''
</P>
<P>
   ``After CVS pulled out, we were told that we'd have a month to
try to get another sponsor,'' said Mingolla. ``The PGA Tour said
they'd help us find a sponsor, but so far as I know they never did.
And then, in March, before the month was up, they called and said,
`Time's up.'''
</P>
<P>
   Ric Clarson, vice president of tournament business affairs for
the PGA Tour, said that tour officials tried, to no avail, to get a
sponsor for the Pleasant Valley tournament. Clarson conceded,
though, that the tour was seeking more big-market sites. ``We'd
like to have tournaments in Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, St. Louis and
Seattle, among other places,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some limitations that events will encounter based on
their markets,'' Clarson said.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, the $5 million tournaments _ the Andersen Consulting
Match Play Championship next February in Carlsbad, Calif. the NEC
Invitational next August, the American Express Championship, to be
held for the first time next November in Spain, and the World Team
Championships in 2000 _ are easier to sell than events like the one
in Sutton, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   The CVS Classic has certainly found that out the hard way.
Largely because it is being held the week after the British Open,
the tournament has drawn only three of the top-25 money winners _
Jim Furyk, Scott Hoch and John Cook, who won the event in 1996.
Mingolla, a former president of the association that represents
tournament directors in the United States, predicted that it will
get even worse for small-market tournaments in the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the four World Golf Championship tournaments offering $5
million purses and $720,000 to the winners, I think you'll see the
top players playing a lot less,'' said Mingolla. ``And the ones
that will suffer will be the small-market tournaments. People are
going to be asking `Where's Tiger?' but they're not going to be
seeing him at a lot of the older tournaments.
</P>
<P>
   Clarson disagreed. ``I think that actually a lot of players will
play more tournaments,'' he said, ``They'll have to keep playing if
they're interested in their world rankings and if they want to stay
eligible for the World Golf Championship tournaments.
</P>
<P>
   ``Historically, as prize money has risen, it has not caused a
decrease in the number of tournaments players play in,'' Clarson
added, pointing out that under the tour's new incentive plan, the
amount of money that goes into a player's pension plan will depend
on the number of events he plays.
</P>
<P>
   Countered Mingola: ``Eventually, some title sponsors are going
to realize that putting money into a small-market tournament is not
a good investment. And I think you'll see them looking at the
NASCAR circuit and other sports vehicles rather than golf.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   With the advent of the four big-bucks championships _ and the
PGA Tour's interest in expanding into more major markets _ other
longstanding tournaments may be in jeopardy. They could include the
Tucson Open, which will have to compete against the first World
Golf Championship event, the Andersen Match Play open to the top 64
ranked players; the Greater Milwaukee Open, which will be shifted
to the CVS Classic's dates next summer, and the Deposit Guaranty
Golf Classic in Madison, Miss.
</P>
<P>
   Another event that could be endangered is the B.C. Open in
Endicott, N.Y., near Binghamton, which has been a tour fixture
since 1973. It is the only PGA tournament without a title sponsor.
Alex Anderson, the 76-year-old haberdasher-turned-tournament
director, spent $1.8 million to upgrade the town-owned En-Joie Golf
Club and he has committed to at least another four years even
though the B.C. Open has been given dates opposite the British Open
from 2000 through 2002.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had no choice,'' said Alexander, who claims that he has
more than 500 ``sponsors,'' ranging from Binghamton area
businessmen who put up as little as $300 a year to corporations
from around the country that contribute a ``high'' of $45,000. ``I
feel that it was cut and dried and I'm in no position to negotiate
for good dates. There's no sense in our getting hard-nosed about
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our tournament is strictly a community effort,'' Alexander
said. ``We need 1,300 volunteers every year, and we have, and we've
raised about $4 million, most of which has gone to hospitals in
Binghamton and Johnson City. We only draw about 70,000 people, but
we feel we've been good for the tour.''
</P>
<P>
   And why hasn't Alexander been able to get a title sponsor all
these years? ``It's because I'm a lousy salesman,'' he said.

<P>
   Army expects tough tour of duty after enlisting in C-USA
</P>
<P>
   &UR; By JERRY WIZIG &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
MEMPHIS, Tenn. _ The ``brave old Army team'' won't be less brave by
any measure as the Cadets compete in a conference for the first
time in the 109 years of West Point's football program.
</P>
<P>
   As the eighth member of Conference USA, Army is forecast to
finish last in the C-USA race, a reasonable forecast, says athletic
director Al Vanderbush, after the team's inconsistent 4-7 record of
a year ago. Half of those four wins were over Division I-AA
Lafayette and Colgate, and the record included losses of 41-0 to
C-USA's Tulane and 39-7 to archrival Navy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though we are picked last, being in a conference gives us
the chance and the expectation to compete for a championship,''
said Vanderbush at the C-USA preseason media day Wednesday. ``It
was important that Army join a conference, and Conference USA fits
our needs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not localized, it helps our recruiting and our image,
and it places us in locales where our alumni and members of the
Army can see us play.''
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, the Cadets sold 9,000 tickets to the 1996
Independence Bowl after a 10-1 regular season, losing a 32-29
shootout with Auburn. Vanderbush expects a similar turnout from
Texas military bases in Killeen, San Antonio and elsewhere when
Army plays at Houston on Oct. 10.
</P>
<P>
   Army coach Bob Sutton began recruiting in Texas for eight years
as an assistant when he was named defensive coordinator on former
coach Jim Young's staff.
</P>
<P>
   ``I found that that state reflected a lot of the same values we
have at West Point,'' he said. ``It's a patriotic state that
certainly prides itself on the intensity of its high school
football, and the things its schools try to teach.
</P>
<P>
   ``The type of young men we want exists in that state. The idea
of serving your country is important there, and young people are
taught discipline and commitment that are needed when you attend
West Point.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Vanderbush: ``Whoever comes to West Point has to have good
academics, a motivation to serve, a sense of pride and commitment.
Texas produces those kinds of individuals and great high school
football programs.''
</P>
<P>
   Sutton used to recruit the entire state by himself. Now, he has
two coaches who try to cover Texas: offensive coordinator Ed
Warriner in the Houston-San Antonio-Austin areas and defensive
coordinator Denny Doornbos in Dallas and West Texas.
</P>
<P>
   With 26 Texans on the preseason roster, Sutton expects the
number to increase to about 40 when incoming freshmen report Aug.
9.
</P>
<P>
   The preseason starting lineup includes center Michael Guzman of
Eisenhower, right guard George McIngvale of Memorial, tight end
Shaun Castillo of Willis, quarterback Johnny Goff of Willowridge
and defensive tackle Joe Stanyer of Southlake.
</P>
<P>
   To start a day that begins at 6 a.m. and includes breakfast
formation at 6:25, then can often last to midnight requires a large
measure of the qualities cited by Sutton and Vanderbush.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a junior and senior, you can manage your time,'' said
offensive tackle Neil Ravitz, a preseason all-conference selection.
``But it can still be hard for some guys. Some guys can just sink
into it naturally after a certain time, but at times you do get
jealous of the flexibility of students at other schools with their
time.''
</P>
<P>
   The normal West Point football player has a pre-practice meeting
at 3:20 p.m. for 30 to 45 minutes, two hours on the field, dinner,
study hall at 7:30 p.m., in his room by 11:30 p.m. and lights out
at midnight.
</P>
<P>
   Ravitz, who will graduate as a second lieutenant with a
five-year commitment to the Army, believes the Cadets' wishbone
offense can keep them in games.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's difficult to prepare for in three or four days coming off
a Saturday game,'' he said. ``If we cut down the turnovers we had
last year, we're going to give the other team just three or four
possessions in a half, and we'll have the ball for 40 minutes out
of 60 and put the pressure on the other team to score when it does
have the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   If defensive back Kenny Dale Rowland gleaned one thing from
games against C-USA members Tulane last year and East Carolina in
1995, it is that the new league member lacks the foot speed of its
counterparts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We saw a lot of speed, a lot of SEC-style play,'' Rowland
said. ``That's something that can kill, and we don't have a lot of
team speed.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Rowland hopes Army's tough mental approach can keep it in
conference games.
</P>
<P>
   ``Football probably is the best laboratory you can have for
learning discipline, doing your job when you're dead tired and
you're behind on the scoreboard,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Added Ravitz: ``We play a disciplined type of football. You
learn leadership, how to work with other people. It's a great
proving ground.''
</P>
<P>
   After all, on a much more important scale, that may be what
Ravitz, Rowland and other Cadets will face in their future.

   Different philosophies bring about scheduling conflict in Big 12
</P>
<P>
   &UR; By JONATHAN FEIGEN &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   DALLAS _ R.C. Slocum can finally play summer golf in peace and
perspiration. No one asks about his cream-puff schedule anymore. He
no longer must defend himself from criticism or explain how his
Aggies came to have Sam Houston or some such presumed pushover on
the schedule.
</P>
<P>
   Those days are over.
</P>
<P>
   Slocum now can begin defending his sanity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I play in these golf events,'' he said this week after a round
with A&AMP;M supporters in San Antonio, ``and they still talk about the
schedule. Now, they ask, `Are you crazy?'
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people question the Florida State thing (the Aug. 31
Pigskin Classic in East Rutherford, N.J.) that I volunteered for.
``If I was a first-year coach, I might try to cover my rear and not
play that game. But long range, this is a great opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   In Manhattan, Kan., only those who doubt Bill Snyder walks on
water are questioned. But as Kansas State continues to play teams
that are as lacking as Kansas State once was, it might not be
blasphemous to ask, ``Are you kidding?''
</P>
<P>
   Snyder isn't, and he's not apologizing.
</P>
<P>
   But some Big 12 coaches and athletic directors say Kansas
State's way is everything from unfair financially and competitively
to unsporting _ like hunting rabbits with a bazooka.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's bad for college football,'' Colorado coach Rick
Neuheisel said. ``It doesn't give the college football fan the kind
of game the college fan deserves. I think we're providing a
disservice to the fans, playing games that don't have any doubt
about the outcome.''
</P>
<P>
   Colorado, which statistically has had the toughest schedule in
the nation this decade, has played some of its most memorable games
against Michigan and played both national champions (Michigan and
Nebraska) last season. Its neutral-site game with Colorado State in
Denver will be its toughest non-conference test.
</P>
<P>
   Texas takes another shot at UCLA, whose 66-3 pounding of the
Longhorns in a non-conference game last season was the beginning of
the end of John Mackovic's tenure as coach.
</P>
<P>
   Although both have lightened their load, Baylor and Texas Tech
have routinely toured the Top 10 before beginning conference play.
Baylor played Miami and Michigan last season. Tech, which has
played Penn State, Ohio State, Florida State, Miami, Georgia and
Nebraska in Spike Dykes' 11 seasons as coach, opened at Tennessee
last season.
</P>
<P>
   Missouri again faces Ohio State. Nebraska gets a return visit
from Washington. Iowa State annually faces Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   Others, however, have begun emulating Kansas State. North Texas
plays almost as many teams from the Big 12 (four) as from the Big
West (five). The Big 12 sought to sponsor legislation that would
allow games against Division I-AA schools to count toward the six
victories needed to qualify for bowls.
</P>
<P>
   Playing a difficult schedule can be costly. Because affiliated
bowls choose teams, rather than have them assigned by the
conference, a Big 12 team with a tougher schedule can hurt itself
when competing against a team with a softer schedule.
</P>
<P>
   Texas A&AMP;M and Kansas State could have the same conference
record. But if Kansas State has a better overall record, it could
have a huge edge in landing a bowl spot.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two years ago, Colorado and Kansas State had that happen,''
Neuheisel said. ``We went 9-2, and they went 9-2, and we beat them
in the head-to-head game. Our losses were to Nebraska and Michigan.
Theirs were to Nebraska and Colorado. And they go to the New Year's
game (the Cotton Bowl) against BYU, and we go to the Holiday Bowl.
Their record was totally inflated.''
</P>
<P>
   Others have argued that several schools are contributing more
greatly to the Big 12's television efforts and are at greater risk.
If Texas is willing to play UCLA or Nebraska against Washington,
the value of a contract with ABC ($17.5 million each year through
2003) presumably increases.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing that bothers me the most is the television thing,''
Texas athletic director DeLoss Dodds said. ``The network and the
cable people buy and pay for our schedules. Those carrying the load
in scheduling pay for everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Every Big 12 school is guaranteed at least $750,000 in TV
revenue, and the league works to have each receive an extra
$142,000 from ABC and $72,500 from Fox Sports Net.
</P>
<P>
   To encourage attractive non-conference games, the league
provides an extra appearance fee for such games chosen by ABC. So
Texas' 66-3 loss to UCLA was worth an additional $284,000 to the
school.
</P>
<P>
   ``But that doesn't cover a chance of getting beat,'' Dodds said.
``We would have been much better off not playing UCLA.''
</P>
<P>
   Dodds said he has brought up the idea of either forcing Big 12
schools to schedule more competitive non-conference games or at
least more effectively encouraging them.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a popular idea,'' he said. ``Those are usually very
short discussions.''
</P>
<P>
   A&AMP;M athletic director Wally Groff described the ideal A&AMP;M
schedule as ``one marquee game, one name game and one bought
game.'' That goal was delayed by LSU buying out a contract that
would have provided four more games against the Aggies and the
creation of the Big 12, which cost one non-conference game with
Colorado and two with Nebraska.
</P>
<P>
   That also can describe Texas' philosophy: the ``bought game''
against an opponent that will agree to play on the road without a
return visit, or to travel twice for one return visit. Those
opponents, almost always games presumed to be mismatches, require
guarantees from $275,000 to $400,000 for the visiting team, but
they help the largest schools schedule at least six home games.
</P>
<P>
   Texas will pay New Mexico State this season but will not return
the visit. Rice agreed to play twice in Austin for one trip to
Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas State built its revival on such games. Relatively few
marquee teams were willing to return visits to Manhattan, Kan.,
citing the small stadium (42,000), difficult travel and a tough foe
that, at the time, did not have enough of a national reputation to
make the risk worth the reward.
</P>
<P>
   More than anything, Kansas State chooses to schedule as it does
_ and to take the criticism _ because for Kansas State, it has
worked.
</P>
<P>
   Many, including Slocum, argue that a more challenging schedule
prepares teams for tougher games to come. Kansas State has not
beaten Nebraska in 30 years and with an otherwise unbeaten team
lost to Nebraska 56-26 last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the reason I'm doing it,'' Slocum said. ``I think it
can make us better.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best season we had was in 1992. We played an early-season
game when we went to California in Bill Walsh's first year back,
the year Stanford won the Pac-10. We won that game and won 12
straight games.''
</P>
<P>
   Others, including Neuheisel, argue that playing top teams takes
``too great a toll'' to be worth it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Based on what has worked for us, I would not see us changing
our scheduling philosophy in the near future,'' Kansas State
athletic director Max Urick said. ``Playing home games and playing
the caliber of teams we play has been successful for us.
</P>
<P>
   ``What works in Manhattan might not in Ann Arbor or Los Angeles
or Columbus. We know what works at Kansas State. We'll not vary
from it. It would be a mistake to let someone influence us (as to
what our priorities) should be.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, such influence will not come from the Big 12. Few seem
to mind. Fewer want to invite the league into the scheduling
business.
</P>
<P>
   And most, no matter how different they might be in philosophies,
believe they are doing it right.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could say they have an advantage playing weak teams,''
Groff said. ``And you might say it's unfair that someone has an
easier schedule. But it could be unfair to them, too. We could play
the tougher games and get the benefits of winning them.''

Policy's 
time up 
as Niner
<TEXT>
<P>
   Team president &QL; 
quits amid turmoil
</P>
<P>
   &UR; By JOHN McCLAIN &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Like a good marriage that turns bad and ends in a bitter
divorce, the longtime friendship and business relationship between
San Francisco 49ers owner Eddie DeBartolo Jr. and team president
Carmen Policy is over.
</P>
<P>
   Policy, who is regarded as one of the best front-office
executives in NFL history, resigned Wednesday and is expected to
join Al Lerner and Bernie Kosar in their bid to become the owners
of the new Cleveland Browns.
</P>
<P>
   Around the NFL, Policy's resignation was no surprise. He and
DeBartolo, friends for three decades who used to be as close as
brothers, had not spoken since January. Friends and 49ers
executives had tried to intervene in their dispute, but none was
successful.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's (his relationship with DeBartolo) in a deep freeze, and
it hasn't been defrosted during the past whatever number of
months,'' Policy said.
</P>
<P>
   When DeBartolo removed himself from day-to-day operation of the
team until his legal troubles were cleared up in Louisiana, he
turned over control to his sister, Denise DeBartolo York, who helps
run the family empire in Youngstown, Ohio. Each owns 45 percent of
the 49ers, who have won five Super Bowls.
</P>
<P>
   DeBartolo thought Policy used his absence to go behind his back
to try to gain control of the franchise that would ultimately make
Policy a part-owner.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stepping aside is very difficult,'' said Policy, who joined
the organization as legal counsel in 1983 and was promoted to
president eight years ago. ``It's awkward, but it's not impossible.
I'm looking forward to the opportunities ahead of me.''
</P>
<P>
   Policy, who is a mover and shaker when it comes to back-room NFL
politics, would not discuss his plans at his Wednesday news
conference, but sources in Cleveland and San Francisco said he will
join Lerner and Kosar, who head one of at least six groups trying
to be the owners of the new Browns.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some excellent opportunities that are available to
me individually, to me as part of a group, that are very
exciting,'' Policy said. ``I see these opportunities as being
golden, but I see these opportunities as fleeting.''
</P>
<P>
   Getting Policy is a brilliant and shrewd move by Lerner, who was
Art Modell's partner with the old Browns, who moved to Baltimore.
Kosar, who played quarterback for the Browns, may be the most
popular player in Cleveland's illustrious football history. Adding
Policy, who is highly respected in the NFL, might give them the
inside track over the Dolan brothers, who have Don Shula heading
their effort and Bill Cosby as an investor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel good about the job I've done,'' Policy said about his
15 years with the 49ers. ``I feel great about the way I've done it.
I feel reasonably comfortable about the results.''
</P>
<P>
   The 49ers won four of their five Super Bowls with Policy playing
a crucial role in the front office. He is being replaced on an
interim basis by Larry Thrailkill, chief operating officer of the
Edward J. DeBartolo Corp. in Youngstown. Thrailkill will represent
the 49ers in league matters.
</P>
<P>
   There had been reports that former 49ers coach Bill Walsh, a
favorite of DeBartolo's, would return to run the organization, but
he was nowhere to be seen Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   49ers vice presidents Dwight Clark, who runs the personnel side
of the organization, and Bill Duffy will run the team. They will
report to Thrailkill.
</P>
<P>
   Whoever replaces Policy will have a difficult time being as
successful. Despite losing key players and changing coaches through
the years, the 49ers remained one of the better teams in the
league. They were always a Super Bowl contender. Players on other
teams wanted to play for them. Policy played a huge role in that
success.
</P>
<P>
   DeBartolo, who has kept a low profile over the last months but
is ready to resume control of the team, issued a statement about
Policy's resignation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Carmen leaves our organization with my best personal wishes,''
DeBartolo said. ``He has been an integral part of the 49ers'
success since we named him president in 1991.''
</P>
<P>
   Because of the well-publicized division between DeBartolo and
Policy, Wednesday's announcement didn't catch the 49ers by
surprise.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've made transitions in the past pretty seamlessly, and
there's no reason to think we can't do it again,'' quarterback
Steve Young said at training camp. ``There's history for what we're
talking about. Today's a little bit chaotic, but I really think
there will be long-term stability.''

DEAD AUTHORS SOCIETY: LITTLE ROOM FOR THE LIVING ON TOP 100 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 CALVIN WILSON  
 c. 1997 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   As the 20th century speeds to a close, the urge to rank its
achievements is reaching critical mass. The same impulse that
brought us America's ``100 greatest films'' now proclaims the
world's 100 finest English-language novels.
</P>
<P>
   But as might be expected, the list released last week by the
editorial board of the Modern Library has its shortcomings and
peculiarities.
</P>
<P>
   For one, it includes only nine books by women. The work of
so-called minorities, and of writers who aren't American or
British, has been similarly neglected.
</P>
<P>
   There's nothing by Margaret Atwood (a Canadian) or Patrick White
(an Australian), who both have international stature. And nothing
by Michael Ondaatje (The English Patient) or Haruki Murakami (A
Wild Sheep Chase), literary nomads who have distinguished
themselves in English.
</P>
<P>
   Nor did any of the novels of two living Nobel laureates _ Toni
Morrison and Nadine Gordimer _ make it onto the list. Most of the
books selected are by authors who are dead _ and long dead at that.
</P>
<P>
   Writers whose names appear twice or more include Joseph Conrad,
William Faulkner, F. Scott Fitzgerald, E.M. Forster, Ernest
Hemingway and D.H. Lawrence. James Joyce occupies both the first
slot (with Ulysses) and the third (A Portrait of the Artist as a
Young Man).
</P>
<P>
   Without question, many of the books cited have merit. But
because few of the selections were published in the latter part of
the century, the list conforms to the sort of xenophobic,
male-dominated, ``great books'' ethic that efforts toward
multiculturalism have sought to alleviate.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's loaded with men,'' said Carolyn Doty, a novelist who is a
professor of English at the University of Kansas. ``There's no
Flannery O'Connor. No Eudora Welty.''
</P>
<P>
   James McKinley, editor of the New Letters literary journal based
at the University of Missouri-Kansas City, agreed that much was
missing from the list.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's real short on gifted female and minority writers, and it
seems to be seriously skewed toward the canon,'' McKinley said. ``I
don't know what D.H. Lawrence is doing on there three times.''
</P>
<P>
   A cynic might wonder whether the placement of Lawrence's novel
Sons and Lovers at No. 9 on the list is due more to its
unquestionable literary attributes or to its being published by the
Modern Library.
</P>
<P>
   The company, which has been publishing works of English
literature at popular prices since 1917, is a division of Random
House, the huge New York book empire. Of course, it stands to
profit financially from any attention the list generates.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 100 novels selected for the list, 59 are currently
published by the Modern Library or other units of the Bertelsmann
group, the big German book octopus, which recently acquired Random
House. And Modern Library has plans to reissue soon at least 10
other titles on the list.
</P>
<P>
   All but one of the scholars, authors and historians who make up
the Modern Library's editorial board _ they include such literary
stars as Britain's A.S. Byatt and Americans Daniel J. Boorstin,
Shelby Foote and Gore Vidal _ are published by Random House or
other Bertelsmann imprints.
</P>
<P>
   Given the Modern Library's emphasis on marketplace-friendly
classics, many of the choices are not surprising. Conspicuous by
their omission are the works of such relatively difficult novelists
as John Barth, Don DeLillo and Thomas Pynchon.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, for those seeking the literary edge, the list offers
little more than Kurt Vonnegut's Slaughterhouse Five (No. 18) and
E.L. Doctorow's Ragtime (No. 86). Vonnegut's World War II novel was
certainly unconventional and challenging for its time (the 1960s),
but, like most of Doctorow's fiction, it now hugs the mainstream
shore.
</P>
<P>
   The Modern Library board apparently applied the ``test-of-time''
standard to such relatively recent work _ including the books by
the few women and minorities included on the list.
</P>
<P>
   The problem with this method of discerning the worth of a work
is that until recently writers who were not male or white had a
hard time getting published period _ at least in the mainstream.
And the list reflects precisely this sort of cultural bias.
</P>
<P>
   The highest ranking works by women are Virginia Woolf's To the
Lighthouse (No. 15) and Carson McCullers' The Heart Is a Lonely
Hunter (No. 17). Edith Wharton is recognized twice, for The Age of
Innocence (No. 58) and The House of Mirth (No. 69). Also cited are
works by Elizabeth Bowen, Willa Cather, Iris Murdoch, Jean Rhys and
Muriel Spark.
</P>
<P>
   African-American authors are represented, perhaps predictably,
by Ralph Ellison's Invisible Man (No. 19), Richard Wright's Native
Son (No. 20) and James Baldwin's Go Tell It on the Mountain (No.
39).
</P>
<P>
   Women and minorities fared better on a list compiled last week
by 100 students in a summer publishing course at Radcliffe College.
</P>
<P>
   Also devoted to identifying the century's 100 finest
English-language novels, it made room for the work of such
prominent female African-American writers as Morrison (whose
Beloved placed at No. 7), Alice Walker and Zora Neale Hurston.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, the works most likely to be included in the Modern
Library's list were those most compatible with the established
Anglo-American canon.
</P>
<P>
   This helps to explain why novelists hailing from India,
Australia, South Africa, Canada and the Third World largely failed
to find a place on the list. Notable exceptions include V.S.
Naipaul (who was born in Trinidad) and Salman Rushdie (who was born
in India).
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a narrow-minded list,'' said G.S. Sharat Chandra, a poet
and fiction writer who is also a professor of English at the
University of Missouri-Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although they may have a couple of names like Rushdie and
Naipaul, that does not necessarily mean that there are not other
writers in other countries, and who also write in English, who have
written books that are worthy of being mentioned.''
</P>
<P>
   The biases of the list notwithstanding, a case could be made
that its very existence is a balm to people who fear that the
health of the literary tradition may be threatened by competition
from television and the Internet, and by the concomitant decline of
reading as a leisure activity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's important to understand that this list is only a
benchmark for literary excellence,'' said Therese Eiben, editor of
the New York-based Poets &AMP; Writers magazine. ``It's a celebration
of writing and reading, and I think it lifts all boats _ as long as
it's not taken as definitive.''
</P>
<P>
   That the list may be perceived as even close to definitive is
the danger. The beginning of a new millennium should be a time for
new thinking _ not an opportunity to reinforce entrenched ideas
about what constitutes culture.
</P>
<P>
   It's difficult for a writer to stand the test of time if his or
her work has only recently begun to be taken seriously _ much less
embraced as art.

   The New York Times said in an editorial on Thursday, July 23:
</P>
<P>
   It has been nearly 10 years since terrorists bombed Pan Am
Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland, killing 270 people. Early on,
American investigators concluded that two Libyan intelligence
agents had planted the bomb. But despite the pressure of
international economic sanctions, Libya has refused to turn over
the suspects to either Britain or the United States, preventing the
case from coming to trial.
</P>
<P>
   Now President Clinton and Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain
have sensibly decided to explore the idea of holding the trial in
the Netherlands, under Scottish law and presided over by Scottish
judges. Libya proposed essentially the same plan in 1994, and has
repeated the offer since then. The ideal location for a trial is
still Britain or the United States. But justice can be served by
holding a Scottish trial in the Netherlands, if the details of
doing so can be acceptably worked out.
</P>
<P>
   These include establishing the legal basis for such an unusual
proceeding, securing the two Libyans' extradition to the custody of
the trial court and agreeing on the conditions required for lifting
sanctions. At a minimum, the suspects should be in custody and
Libya's cooperation in the trial proceedings assured before
sanctions are suspended.
</P>
<P>
   It is possible that Libya was never serious about its offer to
turn the suspects over to a third country. The testimony at a trial
could point uncomfortably close to Col. Moammar Gadhafi and other
Libyan leaders. But the sanctions have hurt Libya's oil industry,
and Gadhafi may be willing to endure the embarrassment of a trial
to get them lifted. Beyond that, Libya has invested considerable
diplomatic capital in getting the Organization of African Unity,
President Nelson Mandela of South Africa and the Arab League to
line up behind the Libyan proposal, and it would face renewed
isolation if it now tried to reverse course.
</P>
<P>
   Erosion of sanctions may well have pushed Washington and London
into embracing a compromise they previously rejected. They should
have explored the idea of relocating the trial long ago. One reason
they did not is opposition from the families of some of the
victims, who bristle at any appearance of a diplomatic concession
to Libya. But the issue here is not scoring diplomatic points. It
is accountability under credible and impartial law. The airliner
bombing was a terrible crime. Justice, long delayed, should have
its day.

THINK OF `DISTURBING' AS `THE STEPFORD TEENS' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 ROBERT W. BUTLER  
 c. 1997 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Disturbing Behavior,'' a thriller, is rated R for strong
violence, sexuality, language and drug content. Running time is 1
hour 23 minutes. Two out of four stars.
</P>
<P>
   Think of ``Disturbing Behavior'' as ``The Stepford Teens.'' It's
a mildly diverting tale of one burg's answer to lazy, antisocial,
underachieving adolescents.
</P>
<P>
   A newcomer to the picturesque island community of Cradle Bay in
the Pacific Northwest, Steve Clark (James Marsden) is immediately
befriended by Gavin (Nick Stahl), the class doper and poster boy
for teen alienation. With a cynical flourish Gavin describes to the
newcomer the various cliques operating at the local high school.
</P>
<P>
   There are the greasers who live for beer and auto mechanics
class, the techno nerds with their bottle-bottom glasses and
laptops, and the skateboard slackers.
</P>
<P>
   Worst of all are the Blue Ribbons, a bunch of squeaky-clean
preppies in blue jackets (they look like the FFA convention, only
with penny loafers instead of cowboy boots). The Blue Ribbons are
beloved by faculty and parents because they behave exactly as
adults would have kids behave. And, believing themselves to be
intellectually, physically and morally superior to their peers,
they sometimes behave like an army of fascist zombies.
</P>
<P>
   Which doesn't seem to bother their mentor and school
psychologist, Dr. Caldicott (Bruce Greenwood). In fact, the Doc has
a waiting list of parents who want their sullen, uncooperative
teens to join the Blue Ribbons. With the help of drugs, implants
and lots of electricity, Caldicott can turn a malcontent into a
model citizen overnight.
</P>
<P>
   But Caldicott's brainwashing techniques still have a few bugs.
While their brains have been programmed to abstain from sex, the
bodies of the Blue Ribbons are full of raging hormones. Unable to
reconcile their chaste conditioning with the carnal call of their
loins, the Blue Ribbons regularly flip out in homicidal rages.
</P>
<P>
   First-time director David Nutter and screenwriter Scott
Rosenberg (``Con Air,'' ``Beautiful Girls'') have an insidiously
clever idea here, but they don't push it very far. Who can blame
them? This is a quick-hit commercial vehicle aimed squarely at the
high school audience. No point wasting creativity on a crowd that
isn't going to recognize or appreciate it.
</P>
<P>
   The performers are just adequate. Most memorable is Katie Holmes
(of TV's ``Dawson's Creek''), who cements her current status as
rising teen sex goddess with her performance as Steve's romantic
interest, a moody beauty with too much mascara, a ring in her
bellybutton and an attitude of disdainful boredom.

 FOX, FIRE and `BRIMSTONE'  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)   c. 1997 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ Developing an idea into a new TV series is a
process that traditionally takes months of effort and millions of
dollars. And if you're developing it for Fox, it had better conform
to the network's mantra of ``daring, distinctive, clever and
well-crafted.''
</P>
<P>
   Funny thing is, the most promising new idea on Fox _ or any
network _ this fall is based on a story we all know from antiquity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brimstone'' is a latter-day retelling of the book of Job, a
man abandoned seemingly by the whole universe, cut off from his
race and set adrift from his maker. It just happens that in this
version, Job wears leather instead of sackcloth and ashes; also, he
seems to be caught up in some kind of creepy vampire movie.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brimstone'' was easily the highlight of the Fox network's fall
presentation to TV critics, who have gathered here to preview the
forthcoming season.
</P>
<P>
   While Fox entertainment chief Peter Roth delivered his customary
passionate pitch about the Fox shows, embracing each one like a
beloved child, the truth is that not one new fall series has
generated the kind of buzz that accompanies a truly original
effort. That may change once viewers get a look at ``Brimstone.''
</P>
<P>
   The show represents the first foray into TV production by a
young movie-writing team, Cyrus Voris and Ethan Reiff, and stars
Peter Horton (who played Gary, the professor who died on
``thirtysomething'') as Zeke Stone.
</P>
<P>
   In 1982 Stone was killed in action while serving as a detective
in New York City. Because of a grievous sin he committed _ killing
the man who raped his wife _ Stone went to hell. But then a
jailbreak of sorts rocked the lower kingdom, and 113 condemned
souls fled to Earth.
</P>
<P>
   There's an order to the universe, even hell, and so the devil is
forced to employ the crafty detective to go back to Earth and
recapture the demons. If he succeeds, Stone is promised some sort
of second chance.
</P>
<P>
   He materializes in New York, near his old precinct. There Stone
begins searching for demons, who have reintegrated themselves among
the living. He also searches for clues into his own humanity, like
Job scraping his sores with broken pottery. A human or two will
befriend him, or try to. And Stone will go looking for his wife,
who has moved to L.A. and has only distant memories of him.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, Stone is isolated, morally, physically and
existentially. And yet he is doing God's will. Even stranger, so is
Satan.
</P>
<P>
   Voris and Reiff had originally thought this story would make a
good movie. Then they decided it could also make good episodic TV.
For a year the two struggled to find a premise that would convince
the networks. The result was a cop show.
</P>
<P>
   While the first of the 113 demons Stone pursues is sure to be
controversial _ a mad priest who was executed a century ago for
killing altar boys _ the show's producers look forward to exploring
the banality of evil as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your neighbor could be one of these people,'' explains Michael
Chernuchin, the veteran producer hired by Fox to shepherd
``Brimstone's'' development. ``The one we always joke about is the
guy from DMV being a demon.''
</P>
<P>
   And the role of Satan himself is striking. He and Stone seem not
to have conversations so much as confrontations. Yet who
understands Stone's situation better than he?
</P>
<P>
   ``The devil is still sort of a trickster,'' Voris said. ``Take
the issue of Stone's `second chance.' Is it a second chance at
life? A second chance at heaven? Or something else?''
</P>
<P>
   The outcome is left in the dark, but perhaps ``Brimstone'' will
get 113 episodes to flesh it out.
</P>
<P>
   Fox's Roth, however, appears to be looking past ``Brimstone''
and the rest of the fall schedule to midseason, when Fox expects to
unveil three strong animated comedies.
</P>
<P>
   One of them is ``Family Guy,'' created by 24-year-old Seth
MacFarlane. To hype the show, Fox has been showing critics a
7-minute pilot MacFarlane produced in May. That's a strategy very
similar to the one Comedy Central used last year to create advance
buzz for its breakout hit ``South Park.''
</P>
<P>
   The two other shows are ``Futurama,'' from ``Simpsons'' creator
Matt Groening, and ``The PJs,'' featuring the voice of Eddie Murphy
as the superintendent of a big-city housing project.
</P>
<P>
   Fox spent as much time this week pushing these shows _ which
have barely begun to move off the drawing board and into production
_ as it spent promoting the fall schedule. And one fall pilot,
``Hollyweird,'' was withheld because it needed to be reshot
virtually from scratch.
</P>
<P>
   All the networks are currently fiddling with or even overhauling
their new shows. It's part of an elaborate development process that
no longer makes sense to many in Hollywood, not when five out of
six broadcast networks are losing money and cable is able to keep
its development costs to a fraction of what broadcasters pay.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a bad system,'' Fox's Roth said Tuesday. ``We have spoken
to all of the studios and we've met with all of the agencies and
declared a new system.''
</P>
<P>
   In the old system, most shows are expected to sink or swim in
the same three-month period in the fall. In the new system,
releases will be spread throughout the year to improve the shows'
survival chances, because individual shows can get more promotional
attention.
</P>
<P>
   In the old system there is a homesteader's rush for talent every
spring at the height of pilot production season. At least one ABC
pilot this year had to be scratched because the producers could not
secure an acceptable lead actor. In the new system, talent that
isn't available in the spring may be available in the fall or
winter. The show's release is timed to the availability of the
talent.
</P>
<P>
   Roth's plan wouldn't necessarily make pilots less expensive or
as numerous, but it could potentially lower the possibility of
failure. And more new releases throughout the year will help stop
the attrition of viewers to cable, as evidenced by improved ratings
Fox had last summer when it aired 40 percent new programming
instead of just repeats.
</P>
<P>
   Such backstage details might make some viewers' eyes glaze over.
But as any TV executive will tell you, the devil _ or is it God? _
is in the details.

IBM REPLACES CHIEF OF CONSUMER PC BUSINESS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By SAUL HANSELL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   IBM replaced the executive in charge of its consumer personal
computer business Wednesday in an effort to turn around a division
that has lagged even as the consumer market has shown steady
growth.
</P>
<P>
   James Firestone, 43, who had headed the unit since August 1995,
will leave to take a similar position at Xerox. In his place, IBM
hired Michael Braun, chief executive of Neuron Data, a software
company. Braun, 48, spent more than 20 years at IBM before being
assigned to run Kaleida Labs, a joint venture by IBM and Apple
Computer to make multimedia software.
</P>
<P>
   ``Firestone never got things going,'' said Gary Helmig, an
analyst with Soundview Financial. ``The consumer business had a
good year in 1996, and it has been a drag ever since.''
</P>
<P>
   IBM's share of the consumer PC market fell from 12 percent at
the start of 1997 to 3 percent last October, according to ZD Market
Intelligence. Analysts attributed much of that drop to IBM's
failure to foresee the rise of computers priced under $1,000. It
has since added less costly models, and its retail share has
bounced back to 16 percent. But it still trails Hewlett-Packard,
with 24 percent of the market, and Compaq, with 22 percent, ZD
says.
</P>
<P>
   Compaq and Hewlett-Packard have emphasized selling low-cost
machines to the mass market. IBM, while focusing on higher-margin,
feature-packed machines aimed at demanding, high-end users, has
been wary of competing for market share in the volatile consumer
market. But in a memorandum to employees announcing the appointment
of Braun, David Thomas, head of IBM's overall personal computer
division, said the company's goal was to become the No. 1 seller of
consumer PCs.
</P>
<P>
   When he joined IBM, Firestone was put in charge of an ambitious
effort by the company's chairman, Louis Gerstner Jr., to capitalize
on IBM's brand recognition. In addition to computers, he was to
introduce software, games and online products. Over the years, most
of these consumer initiatives have been scaled back or closed.
</P>
<P>
   Before joining IBM, Firestone ran the home services unit of
Ameritech Corp. Before that, he worked at American Express, with
Gerstner and G. Richard Thoman, who eventually headed IBM's PC
business. Thoman is now the chief operating officer at Xerox, which
has been expanding its consumer marketing with products like small
copiers.

 &HT;    King's heirs rebuffed in CBS suit
 &HT;    By Arthur Brice and Steve Visser
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- A federal judge Wednesday dismissed a lawsuit filed
by the family of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. against CBS that
sought damages from the TV network for using footage of King's ``I
Have a Dream'' speech in a documentary video.
</P>
<P>
   In a 17-page ruling, Senior U.S. District Court Judge William C.
O'Kelley said the unlimited reproduction and dissemination of the
speech in August 1963 thrust it into the public domain although
King copyrighted it a month later. King's estate accused CBS of
copyright infringement in the suit, filed in November 1996 in U.S.
District Court in Atlanta, and sought unspecified damages.
</P>
<P>
   The King family referred all questions Wednesday to Joseph Beck,
the Atlanta attorney who handled the suit.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are studying the opinion and likely will appeal,'' Beck
said, declining further comment.
</P>
<P>
   CBS hailed the decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``We took on this case to protect the public's right to know,''
CBS News President Andrew Heyward said in a release. ``This
decision means that Dr. King's landmark speech is truly in the
public domain, where it belongs. It is not just CBS News, but the
American public that won today.''
</P>
<P>
   The King estate contends that commercial for-profit ventures
must pay a royalty fee, which is waived for schools, charities and
nonprofit organizations. In 1993, the estate withdrew a lawsuit
against USA Today after the newspaper paid a fee for reprinting the
entire ``I Have a Dream'' speech without permission.
</P>
<P>
   CBS included about 60 percent of King's speech in a ``Twentieth
Century with Mike Wallace'' for-sale video dealing with the civil
rights movement. The network filmed King's speech to 200,000 people
at the Lincoln Memorial, which also was broadcast to a nationwide
audience.
</P>
<P>
   Some media attorneys lauded the judge's ruling.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem with what the King estate wants is that it goes
too far,'' said Sandra Baron, a First Amendment lawyer in
Washington. ``There is much that is done in public view and for the
public which is part of history. An effort to prevent its use for
historical reference, when it is so clearly of historical value,
was and should be doomed to defeat.''

FORD ANNOUNCEMENT EXPECTED TO MEAN GOOD NEWS FOR CLAYCOMO PLANT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RANDOLPH HEASTER  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLAYCOMO, Mo. _ Ford Motor Co. expects to make a
long-anticipated announcement today that a new product, most likely
a sport-utility vehicle, will be built at its Claycomo plant.
</P>
<P>
   Jac Nasser, Ford's president of automotive operations, and
Missouri Gov. Mel Carnahan have scheduled a 10 a.m. press
conference at the Ford Claycomo assembly plant to discuss ``a
significant plant investment,'' according to the automaker.
</P>
<P>
   Ford and United Auto Workers officials declined to comment
Tuesday on the nature of the investment. However, industry sources
have said for several months that Ford had selected Claycomo to
build a new, compact sport-utility vehicle for the 2001 model year.
</P>
<P>
   The compact vehicle, yet unnamed but known within Ford as
``U204,'' will replace the passenger car line at Claycomo that
builds the Ford Contour and Mercury Mystique. The Contour-Mystique,
which had been hyped as Ford's ``world car,'' has not met sales
expectations in the United States since a multibillion-dollar
launch four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Ford also produces the top-selling F-series pickup at Claycomo.
</P>
<P>
   The Claycomo plant is Ford's biggest in North America, with
about 5,100 workers and a $289.5 million payroll. Although industry
sources said they do not believe a new vehicle will add jobs, the
move seemingly will create a more stable work force at the plant.
</P>
<P>
   Ford is expected to heavily retool and renovate the plant, with
reports indicating the cost at $100 million to $600 million.
</P>
<P>
   Ford has sought state and local public assistance. The state has
offered Ford income-tax refunds of $2 million for up to five years
if the company chose the Claycomo facility for the new product.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Ford last month sought to expand an enterprise zone
at the plant that is jointly administered by Claycomo and Kansas
City. The zone expansion would pave the way for various tax breaks.
</P>
<P>
   A retooling could shut down the entire plant, possibly in late
1999. Production on the compact sport vehicle is expected to start
in the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Sources have speculated Ford will team with Mazda in building
the new, four-door compact sport-utility vehicle. It will be
smaller than the Ford Explorer and will compete with vehicles like
the Honda CR-V and the Toyota RAV4.
</P>
<P>
   (begin itals)Automotive News(end itals) recently reported that
Mazda will be responsible for the vehicle's engineering. Mazda will
get an upscale version of the compact vehicle while Ford will build
a low-priced version, according to the trade publication.
</P>
<P>
   Domestic passenger car sales have been sluggish in recent years
as more carbuyers have taken to light trucks, minivans and
sport-utility vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   Automotive analysts generally have praised the quality of the
Contour and Mystique, but sales have not reached levels initially
expected when the car was introduced in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Ford has shut down its passenger-car line in Claycomo at various
times the last three years because of slow sales of the
Contour-Mystique. The car line is currently shut down through this
week, but is expected to be back up next week. The F-series
production line, on the other hand, has been on an overtime
schedule the entire decade.
</P>
<P>
   Critics said the Contour was priced too closely to Ford's bigger
and more popular Taurus. In addition, analysts said the vehicle is
in one of the most competitive segments in the auto industry, with
Japanese cars dominating sales in that category.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Ford sold 151,060 Contours and 41,038 Mystiques, both
double-digit percentage drops from 1996. Ford may move all
production of Contour-Mystiques to Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   The expectation of a new product at Claycomo excited area Ford
dealers.
</P>
<P>
   ``That would be a great deal,'' said Tom Sight, co-owner of Bob
Sight Ford in Lee's Summit, Mo. ``The fact that they picked this
plant says a lot about the quality of the work force here. It will
keep the Claycomo plant viable for years to come.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, a manufacturing consulting firm ranked the Claycomo
facility as among the most productive when compared to other
domestic auto plants. According to the Harbour Report, Ford's
Kansas City Assembly Plant placed second among plants producing
compact cars and also was second among factories that build
full-size pickups.

NEW INDICTMENT IS ISSUED IN COLUMBIA/HCA CASE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla.)   (bl)  
 By KURT EICHENWALD   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Nearly a year after bringing fraud charges against three
executives with Columbia/HCA Healthcare Corp., federal prosecutors
filed a new indictment Wednesday naming a fourth company executive
as a participant in an illegal scheme to defraud federal health
programs.
</P>
<P>
   The fourth executive, Carl Lynn Dick, finance director for
Columbia's Central Eastern division, was charged in the superseding
indictment handed up by a federal grand jury in Tampa, Fla. There
was little surprising in the new charges: prosecutors earlier this
year had announced that they would file new charges in the case,
and allegations against Dick had been raised in a government
affidavit in support of a raid on Columbia last year.
</P>
<P>
   But the charges do offer new details about what prosecutors
believe was a complex scheme to cheat programs like Medicare
through the misrepresentation of certain costs at Columbia's
Fawcett Memorial Hospital in Port Charlotte, Fla. Through documents
known as cost reports, hospitals are able to obtain partial
reimbursement for costs related to patient care.
</P>
<P>
   The new charges also describe the role played in the preparation
of cost reports by Fawcett's accountants, KPMG Peat Marwick. KPMG _
which was not charged in the indictment with any wrongdoing _ is
repeatedly described in the new indictment as participating in
meetings at which efforts by the hospital to benefit from
inaccurate expense claims were discussed.
</P>
<P>
   While the charges filed Wednesday relate only to activities at
Fawcett, government officials are investigating allegations of
fraud involving cost report filings from Columbia hospitals around
the country. In the raids last year, the government seized cost
reports and related records from Columbia hospitals in at least
seven states.
</P>
<P>
   At issue in the Fawcett case is whether the four executives used
the cost reports to misrepresent the purposes of certain hospital
borrowings. That would have allowed the hospital to obtain more
federal reimbursement for interest expenses on those borrowings.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Junge, a lawyer for Dick, declined to comment. Victor
Campbell, a Columbia senior vice president, said the indictment did
not raise any new issues.
</P>
<P>
   KPMG spokesman George Ledwith said the firm was cooperating with
the investigation, and was confident that its services to Columbia
``were appropriate and professional.''
</P>
<P>
   The three executives charged in the case last year _ Jay
Jarrell, the head of Columbia's Southwest Florida division; Michael
Neeb, chief financial officer of its Northern Florida division, and
Robert Whiteside, a director of compensation _ have all pleaded not
guilty.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment says that beginning at least in 1990 the four men
conspired to misrepresent the borrowings as having been used
exclusively for capital expenditures, which are reimbursed heavily
by the government. In truth, the indictment says, only 39 percent
of the money was used for capital expenses. The rest went to cover
administrative costs, which are reimbursed far less.
</P>
<P>
   Although a Medicare auditor once caught the discrepancy and
ordered it changed, the indictment says, the executives later filed
new cost reports with the same inaccurate claim. The indictment
also says that the men provided false information to an outside
lawyer to obtain a legal opinion stating that their expense claims
were proper.

STRONG ECONOMY GIVE STATES CHANCE TO FATTEN THEIR CASH RESERVES 
</HEADLINE>
 _ REVENUES-KAN   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN MURPHY  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ Awash in money, state governments across America are
slashing taxes and piling up reserves in economic times that
haven't been this good in almost 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   News of the increasing flow of money into state coffers came
Tuesday at the annual meeting of the National Conference of State
Legislatures being held, fittingly perhaps, in the city where money
is king.
</P>
<P>
   A report released at the convention of more than 6,000 state
legislators and other officials found that 46 states surveyed had
$28.6 billion in their cash reserves, or 9 percent more than they
spent last year.
</P>
<P>
   Not since 1980 have states saved 9 percent more than they spent.
And the 1998 figures do not yet include California and three other
states who have yet to report.
</P>
<P>
   Missouri and Kansas are tracking closely with the national
trend, officials of those states said Tuesday, and are among 19
states that cut taxes in the most recent legislative sessions
because of excess revenue.
</P>
<P>
   Michigan and Hawaii _ two states who have seen an economic
downturn in recent months _ warned that the good times won't last
forever.
</P>
<P>
   But for now, most states' pocketbooks are bulging because
taxpayers are making and spending more and more money, said Richard
Finan, an Ohio state senator who is president of the National
Conference of State Legislatures this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is mostly a sales and income tax bonanza,'' Finan said.
State taxes overall have now fallen for four straight years, the
group's report said.
</P>
<P>
   Their spending is driven by low unemployment rates and, to some
degree, the soaring stock market, state officials said during a
session Tuesday on state surpluses.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of it is a psyche thing,'' said Stephen Price,
legislative financial director of the Missouri House Appropriations
Committee. ``They see what is happening in the stock market and if
they have a paper gain or not, they feel good and they feel more
free to spend their money.''
</P>
<P>
   With their coffers full, states generally are choosing to cut
taxes rather than increase spending, Finan said. Public schools and
colleges seem to be the benefactors of most spending increases, he
added.
</P>
<P>
   Missouri, which by law must refund tax revenue when it exceeds
spending, approved some income tax cuts this year and eliminated
the sales tax on food a year ago. Kansas lawmakers cut property
taxes and some sales taxes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have debate already from various factions on where the next
round of cuts will be,'' said Paul West, senior fiscal analyst for
the Kansas Department of Legislative Research. ``There is some
discussion of eliminating property taxes.''
</P>
<P>
   According to a preliminary estimate from the legislatures'
conference, states are cutting $3.8 billion in taxes this year,
including $135 million in Missouri and $225 million in Kansas.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-four Missouri lawmakers registered for the conference,
while Kansas registered 38 lawmakers. In addition, 52 staff members
from both states are attending.
</P>
<P>
   Some states are coming up with unconventional and short-term tax
cuts.
</P>
<P>
   Florida and New York, for instance, will grant some weeklong
reprieves on sales tax for clothing.
</P>
<P>
   Louisiana is rebating 1 percent of its sales taxes to local
governments and is gradually doing the same on its 4 percent hotel
and motel tax, a state official said during a panel discussion.
</P>
<P>
   Other states are cutting taxes on fuel, corporate earnings,
hospital revenues and inheritances.
</P>
<P>
   But drinkers and smokers haven't gotten many breaks. No state
reduced sales taxes on cigarettes. New York cut its beer tax and
Indiana cut its tax on hard cider.
</P>
<P>
   Many states are cutting income taxes or giving rebates, but none
as dramatically as Ohio. That state approved a $701 million income
tax rebate this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of things we don't understand about this,''
said Dennis Morgan, legislative fiscal officer for Ohio. ``We're
trying to sort it out.''
</P>
<P>
   A lot of states are sitting on their surpluses until they figure
out whether to save or spend the money. The survey of state
legislatures found that 23 states plunked their surpluses into
reserves.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-two states now have nest eggs of more than 10 percent of
their general fund spending budget. Wall Street recommends at least
a 5 percent cushion.
</P>
<P>
   State officials, including Finan, were buoyant yet cautious.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1980, we were flying about as high as we are now and by
1983 we were in deficit financing,'' Finan said of Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   Finan and others said states are better off to give rebates and
temporary tax cuts than to lower their income tax rates. That way,
hard times are less likely to bring severe revenue losses.
</P>
<P>
   Michigan and Hawaii are two states feeling a downturn right now.
Michigan is losing millions each month because the General Motors
strike, a state official said. Hawaii is suffering because of the
Asian economic crisis and a drop in tourism from Korea and from
Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Kuroda, fiscal officer for the Hawaii legislature, said it
was hard to even justify spending state money to travel to Las
Vegas for the annual legislative conference.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the late 1980s, when everyone else was hurting, we were
doing well,'' Kuroda said. ``We're hoping for better times but
short-term we're still going to face some difficulties.''

FDA PANEL RECOMMENDS CLEARING GENETIC DRUG 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Mass.)   (bl)  
 By ANDREW POLLACK   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ An advisory committee to the Food and Drug
Administration on Wednesday recommended approval of the first drug
using a new technology that blocks genes from performing their
functions.
</P>
<P>
   The drug, developed by Isis Pharmaceuticals Inc., treats a viral
infection that can cause blindness in people with AIDS. The FDA
usually follows advisory panel recommendations.
</P>
<P>
   The technology, known as antisense, holds great promise for
harnessing genetic information to make potent drugs with few side
effects. It has been difficult to make the technology work in
practice.
</P>
<P>
   But today's action could strengthen the field. ``The main impact
is to prove to the skeptics that antisense works,'' said James
McCamant, editor of the Medical Technology Stock Letter in
Berkeley, Calif. ``It's sort of the seal of approval.''
</P>
<P>
   Antisense drugs are essentially short sequences of genetic code
that work by preventing formation of specific proteins that cause
or contribute to disease. Most drugs work by trying to interfere
with the functioning of the protein itself, but often interfere
with more than one protein, causing unintended side effects.
</P>
<P>
   The Isis drug, which is called Vitravene, is injected into the
eye. It interferes with the replication of the cytomegalovirus,
which infects AIDS patients and destroys the retina of the eye.
Analysts expect the drug, to be marketed by the Ciba Vision
subsidiary of Novartis AG, the Swiss pharmaceutical giant, will
have annual sales of only $20 million or so. With AIDS treatment
having improved, fewer patients are getting cytomegalovirus
retinitis. There are also existing treatments for this condition.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the clinical trial data were not totally convincing to
the panel or to the FDA staff reviewer, who said the company had
treated too few patients to determine the drug's safety and
efficacy.
</P>
<P>
   But Isis, which is based in Carlsbad, Calif., has other drugs in
clinical trials that are expected to be bigger sellers,
particularly one for inflammatory disorders like Crohn's disease
and rheumatoid arthritis.
</P>
<P>
   Trading in Isis shares was halted all day pending the
committee's decision. It closed Tuesday at $13.4375, down 81.25
cents.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it is going to become the revolution we hoped it would
be,'' said Dr. Stanley T. Crooke, chairman and chief executive of
the company.
</P>
<P>
   Other companies working on antisense drugs include Hybridon Inc.
of Cambridge, Mass., which is collaborating with the Searle
pharmaceutical division of Monsanto Co., and Genta Inc. of San
Diego.

denounced by a few neighbors. Over time, the architect gathered up

METS SWEEP DOUBLEHEADER FROM BREWERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By JASON DIAMOS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MILWAUKEE _ Last year, if there was one trait that defined the
New York Mets, it was their ability to come from behind and win.
One of their major flaws this year, however, has been the inability
to rally to victory.
</P>
<P>
   But on Wednesday night, after a disappointing homestand, the
Mets regrouped for a seven-game trip and not only rallied for a
ninth-inning victory in one game, but also took command and held it
in the second game to sweep a doubleheader from the Milwaukee
Brewers, 7-5 and 6-1. It was the first doubleheader sweep on the
road for the Mets since 1990, when they pulled one off in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Hideo Nomo won the second game with seven superb innings, after
Dennis Cook won the opener in relief at County Stadium. The sweep
gave the Mets a 51-46 record and nudged them within two games of
the Cubs, their next opponent, for the wild-card spot in the
National League.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets, who pounded out 26 hits in the doubleheader, also put
some distance between themselves and the Brewers (50-50), a team
Nomo has dominated this season. His two complete games this season
have come against Milwaukee, both while he was pitching for Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday night, Nomo (4-8) helped his own cause with a pair
of singles and even knocked in the Mets' first run. Whatever Nomo
was struggling with since joining the Mets, he seems to have put it
behind him.
</P>
<P>
   Over his last three starts, Nomo's earned run average is a
sterling 1.40. And the Japanese right-hander, who allowed one run
and five hits in seven innings with three walks and nine strikeouts
on Wednesday night, has won two consecutive starts after going 80
days without a victory.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets' last ninth-inning comeback was even longer ago than
that. Entering Wednesday night, they were 1-37 when trailing after
eight innings.
</P>
<P>
   Sure enough, the Mets were trailing by 5-4 entering the ninth
inning of the first game, after Bill Pulsipher had been knocked
from his first major league start in nearly three years after just
four innings. They were also going up against a reliever in Bob
Wickman, who had converted 15 consecutive save opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, things looked bleak. But the Mets rallied for
three runs off Wickman in the ninth, the final two when Edgardo
Alfonzo sliced a two-out double to the opposite field in right. And
then John Franco caught Darrin Jackson looking at strike three with
the bases loaded in the Brewer ninth for his 19th save.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always think that the pendulum swings and swings back,'' an
elated Manager Bobby Valentine said after his team rallied for its
12th victory in its final at-bat this season.
</P>
<P>
   Valentine was referring to all those deficits the Mets have not
been able to come back from this season, unlike last year, when
they led the majors by coming from behind to win 47 times and
winning in their final at-bat 24 times.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe it's time for it to swing back in our favor again,''
Valentine said after his team came back to win for the 21st time
this season.
</P>
<P>
   How could he not think so after watching the Mets overcome a 5-2
deficit? The Mets got one run in the sixth when John Olerud homered
to right, then scored again in the seventh on a double by Luis
Lopez and a run-scoring single by Rey Ordonez.
</P>
<P>
   The winning rally in the ninth consisted of a one-out single by
Lopez, a pinch-hit single into the right-field corner by Todd
Hundley, a game-tying grounder by Lenny Harris, a single to right
by Brian McRae and the game-winning double by Alfonzo.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been coming up short,'' Valentine said. ``And today, we
didn't come up short.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mets also bailed out Pulsipher, their starter in the first
game.
</P>
<P>
   Last weekend, after his start had been switched with Armando
Reynoso's, Pulsipher said it would be tough to keep from thinking
that whether he remained in the majors hinged on his performance
today.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm human,'' Pulsipher said after Wednesday night's start. And
it was obvious that Pulsipher, who has been taking Prozac for more
than a year to combat anxiety attacks, was nervous from his first
pitch.
</P>
<P>
   Seven of his first eight pitches were balls as he made his first
major league start since Sept. 11, 1995. Mark Loretta then took a
pair of strikes and fouled off five consecutive pitches before
lining a single to center to move Fernando Vina, who had led off
the Brewer first with a walk, to third.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Cirillo followed with a first-pitch single to right to
score Vina. It was 1-0 Brewers, there were runners on first and
third and no outs.
</P>
<P>
   Pulsipher bore down to strike out John Jaha on five pitches,
then fired two quick strikes past Marquis Grissom. But Grissom
singled to left to score Loretta, and Marc Newfield rifled a ball
off Pulsipher's glove to score Cirillo. The Mets were down by 3-0
before Pulsipher finally escaped the inning.
</P>
<P>
   Luckily for the Mets, the Milwaukee left-hander Brad Woodall
appeared just as nervous as Pulsipher. Woodall walked the bases
full to open the second. One run scored when Lopez grounded into a
double play. Another scored on Ordonez's triple to left. All of a
sudden, it was a 3-2 game.
</P>
<P>
   That is where Pulsipher kept it for two more innings. But
Jackson opened the fourth with a bunt single and advanced to second
on a one-out sacrifice by Woodall. Pulsipher then walked Vina, and
Loretta singled to right to score Jackson. When Cirillo singled to
right to score Vina, the Brewers were up by 5-2.
</P>
<P>
   After Pulsipher again struck out Jaha on his 83d pitch, that was
it. In four innings, he allowed eight hits, all singles, and five
runs to raise his earned run average to 7.62 for 13 innings. He
walked two and struck out five.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pulse gave us what he had,'' Valentine said. ``He gave up some
singles. But it wasn't all that bad.''

</P>
<P>
   Dodgers attempt to regroup from unusually bumpy season
</P>
<P>
   &UR; By JOSEPH DUARTE &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ In a Southern California area accustomed to a few
rumblings, the Los Angeles Dodgers, baseball's model of stability
for years, have sustained one aftershock after another this season.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the moves have been off the Richter scale.
</P>
<P>
   All-Star catcher Mike Piazza, who reportedly sought a contract
worth at least $100 million, was the first to go in a blockbuster
seven-player deal with Florida that also included the Marlins' Gary
Sheffield, Bobby Bonilla, Charles Johnson and Jim Eisenreich. Days
later, Piazza was traded to the New York Mets.
</P>
<P>
   After the Piazza commotion came the Hideo Nomo trade _ as well
as the proposed Randy Johnson deal that collapsed.
</P>
<P>
   Wait, it gets better.
</P>
<P>
   In one of the organization's most stunning moves yet, Dodgers
executive vice president Fred Claire and manager Bill Russell were
fired June 21. Dodgers president Bob Graziano appointed former
manager Tom Lasorda as general manager, and Glenn Hoffman was
promoted from Class AAA Albuquerque to succeed Russell.
</P>
<P>
   And finally, just before the All-Star break, the Dodgers parted
with heralded young infield prospect Paul Konerko and pitcher
Dennis Reyes to acquire closer Jeff Shaw from the Cincinnati Reds.
</P>
<P>
   In the first year of the Fox Group's ownership, things have
begun to settle down. At least for now, as Dodgers players take
each day as if it might be their last in LA.
</P>
<P>
   ``These days, you don't know what to expect when you wake up,''
second baseman Eric Young said. ``It's been one thing after another
all season. You don't expect these things from the Dodgers, because
it's not an organization known for change, but everyone knows
that's changed.''
</P>
<P>
   Enough so that only 14 players remain from the Dodgers'
opening-day active roster. Once the Piazza trade was finalized,
many of the Dodgers players did not suspect any further changes _
and if they did, not so soon afterward. The uncertainty, coupled
with injuries and some players who haven't met expectations, has
kept the Dodgers around .500. Entering Wednesday night's game with
the Astros, the Dodgers were 51-49. It's the first time they have
been that far above .500 since June 12.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles is 14 games behind San Diego in the National League
West and trails the Chicago Cubs by 4{ games in the wild-card race.
</P>
<P>
   But with a $57 million payroll, the club's new ownership doesn't
believe the Dodgers are getting their money's worth. Since the May
15 Piazza deal, the Dodgers are 32-27.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an unfortunate situation with all that's been going on,
especially off the field,'' first baseman Eric Karros said. ``The
bottom line is that you can't argue the fact it has impacted us on
the field.''
</P>
<P>
   While the talk has been about the numerous trades, injuries have
been the main cause for the club's difficult season. Starting left
fielder Todd Hollandsworth underwent season-ending shoulder
surgery, and righthanded pitcher Ramon Martinez is out for the year
with a torn right rotator cuff. Bonilla has been on the disabled
list twice and is not expected back until the end of the month at
the earliest with tendinitis in his left wrist.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers have relied on unproven players to step into
starting roles, most notably third baseman Adrian Beltre, shortstop
Juan Castro and second baseman Wilton Guerrero.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just trying to establish some chemistry, but that's not
easy to do when there's so much stuff going on all the time,''
Young said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite all the turmoil and turnover, Astros manager Larry
Dierker isn't prepared to count the Dodgers out of the NL playoff
chase. The Dodgers are 5-2 against the NL Central-leading Astros
this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``They could be a very dangerous team, but the thing that has
always characterized the Dodgers is great pitching,'' Dierker said.
``With Ramon Martinez out, that certainly has an effect on their
pitching. I don't quite think they are the pitching team they once
were. And with Piazza gone and Bonilla out, they probably aren't
quite as powerful as they were early in the year.''

THE COMPLICATED LIFE OF KATI MARTON

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The sign outside Kati Marton's Bridgehampton shingle house reads
like the name of a big media law firm: ``Marton Holbrooke
Jennings.''
</P>
<P>
   Jennings? As in Peter, her ex-husband and the ABC anchor?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's for my children,'' she said cheerfully. ``No, I'm not
hedging my bets.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Marton, a former ABC Bonn bureau chief and the author of
four books, has led a complicated life ever since her mother, a
Hungarian reporter for United Press International, was taken from
the family's Budapest apartment, accused of being a spy and jailed
for a year, when Ms. Marton was 7. Her father, a Hungarian reporter
for The Associated Press, spent nearly two years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it is too easy to say that the trauma has colored every
aspect of Ms. Marton's emotional life since then. But maybe not.
Friends describe her, accurately, as straightforward, ambitious and
vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, things will get more complicated, and interesting,
this fall, when Ms. Marton's husband of three years, Richard
Holbrooke, is expected to be confirmed as the American
representative to the United Nations. Ms. Marton and Holbrooke have
been longtime members of the East Coast power elite, but this
elevates them to a social apex. It also throws Ms. Marton into
making a decision about who she is going to be.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Wife of the representative to the United Nations? Kati
Marton, author? Some of each?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to give up my day job, which is writing,'' she
said. ``But I know that we're in this together.'' In other words,
when 100 diplomats troop in for a reception, she'll be there. ``And
it won't be an act of enormous sacrifice,'' she said. ``Because I'm
interested.''
</P>
<P>
   It is no coincidence that Ms. Marton's current book-in-progress,
``First Partners,'' looks at presidential couples from Woodrow and
Edith Wilson through Bill and Hillary Clinton. ``I think I have a
certain sensitivity to, let's say, high-profile marriages,'' Ms.
Marton said.
</P>
<P>
   So far she has interviewed 150 people _ among them Nancy Reagan,
Rosalynn Carter and Lady Bird Johnson _ and has concluded that
first ladies with influence beyond decorating and fashion are ``the
rule rather than the exception.'' Ms. Marton has not yet
interviewed Mrs. Clinton, but thinks she now has the role of first
lady ``just about'' right. ``There's not much scope for
improvising,'' Ms. Marton said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Marton, who describes herself as ``skimming 50,'' talked
Tuesday afternoon on the deck of her home, overlooking the
landscapers, who were planting day lilies by the pool. She bought
the house, modest by Hamptons standards, after her 1995 divorce
from Jennings. She has turned it into an airy retreat, now filled
with pictures of a typically rumpled Holbrooke. She fits in better
with the setting: a chic, vaguely exotic woman in black pants and a
crisp white shirt, born in Hungary, raised in Chevy Chase, Md., and
educated at the Sorbonne.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, she wasn't relaxed _ she has interviewed too many
people herself for that, and knows the pitfalls _ but was gracious
and open.
</P>
<P>
   ``Marriage is an enormous challenge to make work,'' she said.
``But once you have that, everything flows from that. Because it
frees you. I feel much more together now that I have a successful
marriage. Because I know there's somebody behind me, who thinks
that for me failure is impossible.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Marton is of course rhapsodizing about a man who has never
been known for his patience, modesty or lack of ambition. ``But I
am able to say to him, `Shut up, Richard, I'm not finished,''' Ms.
Marton said brightly. ``And there is no arrogance. He's tolerant to
a fault of other people's quirks, having so many of his own.''
</P>
<P>
   The two first met as neighbors at the Beresford, the
celebrity-filled Central Park West co-op where Ms. Marton lived
with Jennings and Holbrooke lived with Diane Sawyer, the ABC
correspondent now married to the director Mike Nichols. (Holbrooke
has two ex-wives, but Ms. Sawyer is not one of them. Ms. Marton has
two ex-husbands, the first a former fellow graduate student at
George Washington University. ``A starter marriage,'' she said.)
</P>
<P>
   Anyway. As Ms. Marton's marriage to Jennings was ending, she
toured the Loire Valley with her old friend Richard. ``I was seeing
things I'd never seen, because of course Holbrooke does everything
very methodically,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   They were married in May 1995 at the residence of the American
ambassador in Budapest, where Ms. Marton had hidden with her
parents during the 1956 Hungarian Revolution _ just after her
parents were released from prison, and before the family emigrated
to the United States. ``It was the final exorcism of a ghost,'' Ms.
Marton said.
</P>
<P>
   She will never forget the day her mother was taken away: ``I
opened the door to her jailers,'' she said. ``They were dressed as
electricians. I had a sense they were not who they said they were,
but I was playing with an older girl, one who I had a crush on, and
I didn't want to interrupt. So I just called to my mother and went
back to my room. I didn't see her for a year after that.''
</P>
<P>
   The chatter among her friends is that she would make a good
ambassador to Hungary someday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would like to say that my goal in life is to be the spouse
of the ambassador to Hungary,'' said Holbrooke, who did not bring
up his better-known goal to be secretary of state. ``But that's
another play.''

EDITORIAL OBSERVER: DID YOU NOTICE? THERE'S AN AUTOMOBILE STRIKE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By FLOYD NORRIS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   There was a time when a strike that shut down General Motors,
and hurt the economy, would have been at the top of the news every
day. Public pressure for a settlement would have been intense.
</P>
<P>
   In those days, GM so dominated American auto production that
Detroit feared antitrust action to break up the car maker. Then,
the issues that divided the United Automobile Workers and the
company were much easier to understand. The workers wanted more
money, and management was reluctant to pay it.
</P>
<P>
   The current GM strike _ and the relative lack of attention it
has received _ is a sign of how far the mighty have fallen. There
is, to be sure, talk that the virtual elimination of GM production
in North America is shaving economic growth by half a percentage
point or so. But there is no pressure from Washington to do
something about the strike. GM is just not as important to the
country as it used to be.
</P>
<P>
   Viewed from a long perspective, GM's labor problems are another
example of its inability to get the big things right. It tried to
save money by eliminating the real differences between its brands,
and found that customers noticed. It plowed huge sums into factory
robots that did not live up to expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Auto strikes once were threatened every few years, when the
national contract was expiring. At GM, they now seem to occur with
regularity because the contract allows strikes over local issues
such as job safety and speedups. And GM, by adopting just-in-time
inventory procedures, has assured that a strike at one plant can
quickly affect most of the company. GM loses hundreds of millions
of dollars, while the union strike fund barely notices the impact.
(Most workers get unemployment compensation because they are
counted as laid-off workers, not as strikers.)
</P>
<P>
   Strikes over local issues are also permitted at Ford and
Chrysler. But they don't happen. One reason may be that those
companies took the painful steps to become competitive in the early
1980s, when times were tough. GM dithered. Another is that GM keeps
losing market share, making more cuts necessary.
</P>
<P>
   That slowness to move reflected the attitude of both management
and workers that GM would always be a powerhouse. The company
guaranteed job security for current workers regardless of how well
GM did. That gave rise to a sense of entitlement among workers, as
well as an almost reflexive hostility to any effort to change work
rules or increase productivity. GM has the least efficient system
of the American automakers, and the worst labor relations.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, GM has talked tough but backed down in the face
of potentially crippling local strikes. But now it vows not to give
in, and to force workers to improve productivity. The workers think
GM cannot be trusted, and fear that there will be no jobs for a new
generation of American auto workers.
</P>
<P>
   There was a time when GM could prosper even if managers and
workers hated each other. But that was when competition was far
less intense. Now the industry faces worldwide overcapacity. Plants
with relatively high wages are unlikely to be competitive without a
spirit of cooperation and teamwork.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, there are few signs that such a result is likely
when this strike ends. Unable to cut a deal with the union, GM is
trying to persuade a mediator that the strike is in violation of
the national union contract because it is not about safety issues,
as would be permitted, but instead about investment and the moving
of jobs overseas. If it wins that argument and the workers come
back against their will, GM will be able to make cars again, but it
will be unlikely to make much progress in getting ready for the
coming industry shake-out.

FOR DISPLACED HOTEL RESIDENTS, A LONG ODYSSEY 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By DAVID ROHDE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Moments after Tuesday's construction accident in
Times Square, the 275 residents of the Woodstock Hotel, most of
them elderly or mentally ill, were rushed to safety and told they
would be taken care of by city officials, the Red Cross and an
array of nonprofit organizations.
</P>
<P>
   But 12 hours later, they found themselves cooped up on a hot,
crowded floor of the Times Square Hotel, the victims of
finger-pointing, insurance worries and finally by a mundane, if
familiar, New York City concern: the inability to find inexpensive
hotel rooms.
</P>
<P>
   They finally were moved to temporary accommodations at 11 p.m.
That was 14 hours after a temporary elevator tower at the Conde
Nast building across the street collapsed and a long section of it
slammed into the hotel's roof, killing an 85-year-old resident and
rendering the building's two top floors unsafe.
</P>
<P>
   In the confusion created by the accident and the hotel's
evacuation, many residents went without medication for 12 hours. A
group of 32 residents were believed by Red Cross doctors to need
medical monitoring. After all the other Woodstock residents were
moved to hotels and YMCA's to sleep, the group of 32 were finally
taken by bus to Bellevue Hospital Center.
</P>
<P>
   Marion Graham, 60, a retired mechanic, said that once the group
arrived at Bellevue, they had to sit through two hours of
processing. ``We didn't get to Bellevue until 2 a.m.,'' he said.
``We didn't get to bed until 4.''
</P>
<P>
   Riley Varner, 71, a Woodstock Hotel resident, takes four
different pills for heart problems and seizures. He waited at the
Times Square Hotel all day Wednesday after he had to leave the
Woodstock without any belongings, and was finally taken to
Bellevue. ``I didn't get much sleep last night,'' he said. ``I
haven't been taking my medication like I should have.''
</P>
<P>
   Workers involved in caring for the group said the difficulties
they encountered were in some ways the inevitable result of the
confusion that fell on midtown.
</P>
<P>
   But Cynthia Dial, the executive director of Project Find, the
nonprofit organization that runs the Woodstock, complained that
efforts to aid the victims had been hindered because the Durst
Organization, the construction project's developer, and Tishman
Construction Corp., its construction manager, had refused at first
to cover emergency costs. Ms. Dial and Rosanne Haggerty, executive
director of the Times Square Hotel, also said the American Red
Cross had responded slowly after the accident.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem was that nobody was coming through and the Red
Cross was moving slowly,'' Ms. Dial said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Haggerty, executive director of Common Ground, which runs
the Times Square Hotel, was less charitable. ``I was stunned,'' she
said. ``It was irresponsible and callous.''
</P>
<P>
   By roughly 2 p.m. all of the Woodstock residents were in place
and workers at the Times Square began calling hotels in the area.
</P>
<P>
   The Best Western chain offered to house all the Woodstock people
in rooms in five of its Manhattan hotels at prices ranging from
$125 to $160. Ms. Dial said she contacted Douglas Durst of the
Durst Organization and officials at Tishman.
</P>
<P>
   She said that both companies told her they would have to check
with their insurance carriers. At 6 p.m., Ms. Dial said, she had
not heard from them. Red Cross officials at the scene told her that
the Best Western room rates were too high and that they could find
alternative housing for the Woodstock's residents by roughly 8 p.m.
The reservations at the Best Western were canceled. Eight o'clock
came and went.
</P>
<P>
   At 8:30 p.m., Durst, after being contacted by City Councilman
Thomas Duane, called to say he would pay for the first night's
hotel room out of his own pocket. But Red Cross representatives
said they could find housing themselves.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview Wednesday, Durst confirmed Ms. Dial's account.
He said he received Ms. Dial's first call at 4:30 p.m. but that he
was advised by his insurance company that directly paying any costs
from the accidents would jeopardize his insurance policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I spoke with them again at around 8:30 and said that I would
pick up the tab,'' Durst said.
</P>
<P>
   As the search for hotels drifted past 10 p.m., the first
medications began arriving for Woodstock residents, many of whom
had been without the medicine they need for various illnesses and
psychiatric problems since the 8:30 a.m. accident. Red Cross
spokesman Robert Wingate said the sheer number of people involved
slowed efforts to understand which prescriptions were needed.
``That's a process that takes some time,'' he said. ``Think of the
task of assessing those needs.''
</P>
<P>
   The residents of the Woodstock were not alone. Twenty-eight
members of a Georgia church group in New York on a community
service trip fared little better. They were ordered to leave Lamb's
Church on West 44th Street after the collapse, but had no time to
collect personal belongings. The American Red Cross took them by
bus to two Bronx motels at 2 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, after some of its members complained of flea bites,
the group decided to pay for their own rooms at the Hotel Carter,
on 43rd Street, even though the street was cordoned off. Wednesday,
they departed for Georgia, leaving their personal belongings
behind.
</P>
<P>
   It was 2 in the morning when they climbed off their bus in the
Bronx and through the chain-link fences of the Cross-Bronx
Residence on 175th Street or the Baychester Motel on East 202nd
Street. For these church-going teen-agers of prosperous families,
the accommodations were, as one said, ``a real eye-opener _ a whole
new world.''
</P>
<P>
   By Wednesday, donations were flowing into the Woodstock. The
Durst Organization and Tishman Construction Corp. agreed to cover
the cost of any accommodations the Red Cross could not afford. Bell
Atlantic agreed to provide the group with a $25,000 donation,
cellular phones and voice-mail services for the residents of the
hotel. Columbia University offered to house Woodstock residents in
empty dormitory rooms.

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ With a Senior PGA Tour-leading four victories this
year and 12 wins in less than two full seasons, Gil Morgan might
not need much in the way of an equipment boost.
</P>
<P>
   But the 1997 senior rookie of the year and champion in two '98
senior majors is happy to take every edge the U.S. Golf Association
allows.
</P>
<P>
   Like his graying peers in a tour filled with players of
gradually diminishing motor skills and physical strength, Morgan
applauded the USGA's recent decision to take no immediate steps to
rein in golf technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we are more into the technology stuff,'' Morgan said
of senior tour players. ``Guys trying to maintain their games,
trying to hang on to distance and stuff. They are probably
experimenting with different types of things more so than the
regular tour player at this point in time.''
</P>
<P>
   Few pro golfers experiment more than Terry Dill, the 1996 senior
driving leader who just loves what technology has done for his
game. He believes ``beyond any shadow of a doubt'' that improved
equipment helps senior tour players.
</P>
<P>
   Dill has grooves in his putter to promote a quicker roll,
abrasive facing on his irons for tighter landing patterns and
cavity-backed clubs for better bounce. He has long-shafted drivers,
four different types of wedges ... and he keeps an eye open for
anything else that might help.
</P>
<P>
   The former Texas A&AMP;M law school professor and grandfather of
five is hardly in the minority when it comes to keeping abreast of
the latest golf innovations.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you go out on our practice tee, you will see all the guys
trying every new thing that comes out to see if it is any edge,''
Dill said.
</P>
<P>
   Now in his 10th year on the senior tour, Dill says he is playing
the best golf of his life. He attributes it to the equipment.
</P>
<P>
   ``By using a lot of this stuff, you add a little bit here, a
little bit there,'' he said, ``... where the really good (PGA Tour)
players, they are using hardly any high-tech stuff at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't need it because they are pure. But we are doing
everything we can to keep on playing.''
</P>
<P>
   Dill doesn't think it will be necessary for the USGA to change
the rules to protect courses from technology, saying ``It doesn't
really help good players that much.''
</P>
<P>
   But the USGA might have the final word on that. In announcing no
immediate rule changes last month at the U.S. Open, USGA executive
director David Fay also spoke of a proposed new test to measure the
springlike effect of clubheads.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan wonders what the fuss is all about.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't raise the basketball goal or raise the net in
tennis,'' he said. ``You know, they don't do all those things with
other sports. I don't know why they are continually doing it with
golf.''
</P>
<P>
   As for 11-time senior tour winner Bob Murphy, don't get him
started on the subject of the proposed spring-effect test, which
would include clubs previously tested and approved.
</P>
<P>
   ``Golfdom is very happy, golfdom is doing very well,'' Murphy
said. ``I don't for one minute believe they should outlaw all these
clubs and whatnot they've already approved.''

KLAHN GETS SPOT IN OPEN

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Gary Klahn of Thousand Oaks phoned Riviera Country
Club on Monday, just in case. As first alternate for this year's
U.S. Senior Open, Klahn figured he had a chance for a belated
invitation.
</P>
<P>
   No openings yet, he was told by U.S. Golf Association officials
on site. No problem, said Klahn, who headed out to Riviera for a
practice round, just in case. When he arrived, he found himself in
the field _ a replacement for Tommy Aaron, who had to withdraw that
morning because of a sprained ankle.
</P>
<P>
   Klahn, a former teaching professional at Wood Ranch in Simi
Valley, will tee off in today's 1:40 p.m. group, joining 1991 Ford
Senior Players champion Jim Albus and 23-time PGA Senior Tour
winner Bob Charles.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Dent, Bud Allin and John Bland withdrew on Tuesday, giving
replacement berths to, respectively, John Baker of Hermitage, Pa.,
Robert Heaton of Antioch, Calif., and Don Shevorski of Anaheim.
Shevorski, 57, is playing in his fourth Senior Open and his second
as an alternate.
</P>
<P>
   Local qualifier: Simi Valley's Bill Brooks, a six-time Sunset
Hills Country Club champion and Wood Ranch member, struggled up the
18th fairway Wednesday and pronounced Riviera fit for a national
championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tough,'' said the 56-year-old retired L.A. policeman, who
earned his Open berth by winning a three-man playoff in a June 29
qualifying event.
</P>
<P>
   The Riviera rough, combined with hitting into the wind on holes
12-16 and greens measuring near 11 on the stimpmeter, made Riviera
a problem for Brooks for a fourth straight practice round.
</P>
<P>
   The key to playing well here?
</P>
<P>
   ``Hitting the fairways,'' he said. ``You've got to stay out of
the rough.''
</P>
<P>
   Brooks' practice-round struggles inside the ropes, however, have
been just part of his early Open experience. He also had his
picture taken this week with Arnold Palmer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to get it blown up real big and bring it back for
his autograph,'' Brooks said.
</P>
<P>
   One of 30 amateurs in the 156-man field, Brooks opens today at
7:50 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   Local knowledge: Dave Stockton (1974), Hale Irwin ('76) and Gil
Morgan ('78) have all won before at Riviera, while playing in L.A.
Opens (now Nissan Open) on the PGA Tour.
</P>
<P>
   Strange but true: Jack Nicklaus and Arnold Palmer, two of the
most successful players in the history of professional golf, have
never won at Riviera. Palmer won three L.A. Opens but all at Rancho
Park. Nicklaus, who never won in the L.A. Open, came closest to a
victory at Riviera when he finished second by a stroke to Hal
Sutton in the 1983 PGA Championship.
</P>
<P>
   Honor roll: Nicklaus, Lee Trevino, Gary Player, Billy Casper,
Palmer and Orville Moody are the only players to win both the U.S.
Senior Open and U.S. Open.
</P>
<P>
   Of this week's entries, Tony Jacklin (1970), Hale Irwin (1974,
'79, '90), Hubert Green (1977), David Graham (1981), Larry Nelson
(1983) and Raymond Floyd (1986) have won the U.S. Open part of that
national championship double.

RESEARCHERS PRODUCE MORE THAN 50 MOUSE CLONES
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs 18th graf to correct spelling of Dr. Alec Jeffreys)  (sw) 
 By GINA KOLATA    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Scientists from Hawaii said Wednesday that they have made dozens
of adult mouse clones and even cloned some of those clones.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement, coming after months of rumors, still stunned
biologists when they heard the details. It means, they say, that
advances in cloning are coming faster than even the most confident
scientists had imagined.
</P>
<P>
   The research team took just months to churn out clones of adult
mice, following the announcement last year that the first clone of
an adult animal, Dolly the sheep, was created in Scotland.
</P>
<P>
   In Thursday's issue of Nature, Dr. Ryuzo Yanagimachi, 69, a
biologist at the University of Hawaii, and his postdoctoral
student, Dr. Teruhiko Wakayama, report on the first 22 mice that
are clones, seven of which are clones of clones. They say they have
made a total of more than 50 mouse clones.
</P>
<P>
   The feat, scientists say, means that cloning an adult animal
like Dolly is not a fluke as some have suggested. And with mice,
they can study and perfect cloning in an easily available and
familiar lab animal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wow,'' said Dr. Barry Zirkin, who is the head of the division
of reproductive biology at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore.
``This is going to be Dolly multiplied by 22.''
</P>
<P>
   In cloning mice, Yanagimachi and Wakayama defied conventional
wisdom among biologists, who had long contended that mice would be
perhaps the one mammal that was impossible to clone because of
extraordinarily rapid development of the mouse embryo just after
fertilization.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Lee Silver, a mouse geneticist and reproductive biologist at
Princeton University, described the speed at which the cloning
progressed as breathtaking. ``It's absolutely incredible,'' he
said. ``He did all this in the past year.''
</P>
<P>
   The implications of the work were clear, Silver added.
``Absolutely,'' he said, ``we're going to have cloning of humans.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If we follow scientific protocol,'' he added, ``it could take
5 to 10 years before in vitro fertilization clinics add human
cloning to their repertoires.'' The protocol would require that the
method first be perfected and shown to be safe in mice and then
monkeys. ``But that does not mean that somebody would not do it
without those steps,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Zirkin said that human cloning ``needs to be discussed,'' but he
added that the main significance of Yanagimachi's announcement lies
in the opportunities it creates for scientists to explore question
about basic reproductive biology. ``One of those questions, but
only one,'' he said, ``has to do with the cloning of humans.''
</P>
<P>
   The concept of genetically duplicating any person or animal by
using the DNA of a single cell has captivated scientists and the
public for decades.
</P>
<P>
   But until last year, when the birth of Dolly was announced, most
scientists had given up on the idea of cloning adults, although
they generally agreed on the potential for cloning fetal cells.
Even though every cell in the body has the same genetic material,
cells of adults have reached their final state of development and
never budge from it. Heart cells do not become liver cells, lung
cells do not become brain cells.
</P>
<P>
   To clone an adult, the genetic material from one of these cells
would have to essentially go backwards in time and enter the state
it was in when sperm first fertilized egg.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   On Feb. 23, 1997, the world learned that Dr. Ian Wilmut of the
Roslin Institute and Dr. Keith Campbell of PPL Therapeutics in
Roslin, Scotland, had created Dolly by cloning from an udder cell
of a six-year-old ewe.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, critics emerged, led by Dr. Norton Zinder, a
microbiologist at Rockefeller University in New York. Zinder
questioned Wilmut's genetic evidence that Dolly was a clone.
Moreover, he pointed out, it took 400 tries to produce Dolly and no
other adult had been cloned. One success out of 400 tries is ``an
anecdote, not a result,'' Zinder said.
</P>
<P>
   Wilmut responded to Zinder in two papers also published in
Thursday's issue of Nature. Wilmut's group and an independent group
that included the inventor of DNA fingerprinting, Dr. Alec Jeffreys
of the University of Leicester, compared DNA from the original
piece of udder _ frozen at the Hannah Research Institute more than
100 hundred miles from the Roslin Institute _ to the DNA of the
udder cells that were frozen in a test tube at the Roslin Institute
and used to create Dolly to the DNA of Dolly. All the DNA sequences
were identical, the researchers reported.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Davor Solter of the Max-Planck Institute for Immunobiology
in Freiburg, Germany, wrote in an editorial accompanying the papers
that the results ``now lay these doubts'' about Dolly ``to rest.''
</P>
<P>
   But Zinder, in a telephone interview, said he still was not
convinced. The investigators, he said, did not prove that the chunk
of udder that they had stored at the Hannah Research Institute
really was the source of the test tube of cells used to create
Dolly. ``They didn't keep proper records,'' Zinder said. ``We don't
know what that chunk of tissue was.''
</P>
<P>
   Zinder also questioned Yanagimachi's work. ``I'm no mouse
expert, but it looks to me like it's very very shaky,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Those who are mouse experts did not share Zinder's doubts about
the cloning.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``I am convinced,'' said Dr. John Eppig, an expert in mouse
embryo development at the Jackson Laboratory in Bar Harbor, Maine.
``Definitely. There is no question.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The significance of this one is that it's incontrovertible,''
said Dr. Richard Schultz, an expert in early mouse embryo
development at the University of Pennsylvania. It is, ``a superb
experiment,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In his cloning experiment, begun just a year ago, Yanagimachi
used one of Wilmut's key ideas, but varied his method.
</P>
<P>
   Wilmut proposed that the secret to cloning was to put a cell
into a resting state, so that it was not dividing, before using it
to clone. He did this by starving the udder cells so they went into
a state of hibernation. Then he slipped one of those cells into a
sheep's egg whose own genetic material had been removed and gave
the egg a shot of electricity to start the development.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, Yanagimachi and Wakayama started with three types
of cells that were already in a resting state: cumulus cells, which
cling to eggs like a thick smear of caviar; Sertoli cells, which
are the male equivalent of cumulus cells, and brain cells. That
experiment indicated that cumulus cells would be easiest to clone,
so the scientists homed in on them and used them exclusively.
</P>
<P>
   Yanagimachi and his colleagues injected the cumulus cell's
genetic material into mouse eggs whose own DNA had been removed.
They waited six hours to give the egg an chance to reprogram the
cumulus cell's DNA and then chemically prodded the egg to start
dividing. The process of reprogramming remains a mystery to the
scientists.
</P>
<P>
   All of the mouse clones were female.
</P>
<P>
   Yanagimachi and his colleagues verified with genetic tests that
their mice were indeed clones. Also, in one experiment, they used
coffee colored mice for the cumulus cells, black mice for the eggs,
and white albino mice as surrogate mothers. As predicted, the
clones were coffee colored.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Despite the enthusiastic reception for the results of
Yanagimachi's experiment among reproductive biologists, he had
great difficulty publishing his paper. On Oct. 5, after cloning the
first four mice, he submitted a paper to the journal Science, which
rejected it without peer review, telling him it was ``not of
general interest,'' he said. Diane Dondershine, a spokeswoman for
Science, said the journal's policy is not to comment on papers that
were submitted.
</P>
<P>
   Yanagimachi then he sent his paper to Nature, which forwarded it
to two reviewers, one of whom asked repeatedly for additional
proof. In March, the journal sent the paper to two more reviewers
before finally accepting it last month, Yanagimachi said.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, the scientists kept cloning.
</P>
<P>
   Cloning has gotten so straightforward, Wakayama said in an
interview, that he has now made more than 50 clones and could clone
every day with no difficulty and turn out baby mice after the
normal 20-day gestation period.
</P>
<P>
   And lest anyone doubt that the clones exist, the scientists
carried a cage of mice to New York to show them off, including a
coffee colored adult mouse that was cloned, the clone created from
that mouse, the black mouse that provided an egg for the cloning,
and the white mouse that was the surrogate mother.
</P>
<P>
   Already, a venture capitalist in Hawaii is setting up a
consortium of companies and academic scientists to make the cloning
of adult animals a commercial reality within a few years. But the
investor, Laith Reynolds, the chief executive officer of Probio
America, said, ``We have no interest in cloning humans.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Besides being the politically correct answer,'' he added, ``we
can't see any business in it.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, scientists say, the opportunity is here to figure out how
cloning works, how to make it work better, and how to apply it.
</P>
<P>
   For example, noted Dr. George Seidel, a cloning expert from
Colorado State University in Fort Collins, scientists want to
understand how an egg reverses the program of a cell's DNA. Once
they figure that out, they might eventually be able to turn one
cell into another.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's say my pancreas was being destroyed for one reason or
another,'' Seidel said. ``If there are some cells in my body that
can make a whole individual, they certainly can make a pancreas,''
he said. ``It's pretty important, pretty potent stuff from a
long-term standpoint,'' Seidel added.
</P>
<P>
   And then there is the question of actually cloning people.
</P>
<P>
   Human cloning, Seidel said on Wednesday, ``is clearly more
imminent.'' &QL;

   Two marketing research and consulting companies _ Roper Starch
Worldwide in New York and the Response Analysis Corp. in Princeton,
N.J. _ said on Wednesday that they had signed a letter of intent to
combine operations under the Roper Starch name. Financial terms
were not disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   Response Analysis will operate as a division of Roper Starch,
retaining its name and its Princeton location. James Fouss, 57,
president of Response Analysis, becomes vice chairman of Roper
Starch; William Wilson, 62, chairman and chief executive of Roper
Starch, continues in those roles.
</P>
<P>
   Roper Starch has 250 employees and revenue estimated at $40
million from clients like the Colgate-Palmolive Company and the
Procter &AMP; Gamble Co. Response Analysis has 120 employees and
revenue estimated at $16 million from clients like the Banc One

   Medicare health maintenance organizations competing for new
enrollees appear to work at selling themselves to healthier
potential customers, according to a study released by the Kaiser
Family Foundation in Menlo Park, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   The study was based on an analysis by Porter Novelli, a unit of
Omnicom Group, of marketing practices by HMO's in Cleveland, Los
Angeles, Miami and New York. Researchers reviewed ads in 169
newspapers and on 129 television stations and observed and analyzed
21 marketing seminars to assess the marketing techniques used by
HMO's to attract Medicare enrollees.
</P>
<P>
   The marketing efforts seemed to be aimed at the physically
active elderly, the study concluded, rather than the full range of
Medicare beneficiaries, such as those who are older, sick or under
age 65 and disabled. More than half the commercials portrayed older
people engaged in physical or social activities like running and
swimming, the study reported; none showed anyone in a hospital or
using a wheelchair or walker.
</P>
<P>
   And nearly a third of the 21 marketing seminars the researchers
attended were not accessible to wheelchairs, the study said.
</P>
<P>
   DDB Needham Worldwide in New York, part of Omnicom Group, took
the Best of Show Award at the 20th annual Ace Awards for
business-to-business communications, sponsored by the Business
Marketing Association in New York.
</P>
<P>
   The top multiple winners, tied with six awards each, were
Clarion Marketing and Communications Group in Stamford, Conn., part
of MacManus Group, for work for clients including Arrow
Electronics, and Mobium Creative Group in Chicago, for work for
clients like R.R. Donnelley &AMP; Sons. Winning five Ace awards each
were Anderson &AMP; Lembke in New York and San Francisco, part of the

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Robert Young wasn't a real doctor, though he
played one on television.
</P>
<P>
   Nor in real life was Young always the calm, unshakable pillar of
paternal wisdom he appeared to be in ``Father Knows Best,'' a role
that stamped him as a mass-market swami of nuclear-family values.
</P>
<P>
   Off camera, the resident of Westlake Village northwest of Los
Angeles, who died Tuesday at age 91, suffered from terrible bouts
of depression and alcoholism.
</P>
<P>
   But to a generation of TV viewers, Young was the ultimate
paterfamilias, a gentle, infallible arbiter both of minor domestic
crises and life-or-death medical matters.
</P>
<P>
   Though he enjoyed substantial success as a film actor, appearing
in such memorable movies as ``Sitting Pretty,'' ``Strange
Interlude,'' ``Northwest Passage'' and ``Journey for Margaret,'' it
was within the cozier confines of television that Young's warmth
and humanity truly shone.
</P>
<P>
   And it was on television that he left his deepest imprint on
popular culture, first in ``Father Knows Best'' (1954-1963), for
which he won two Emmys, then for ``Marcus Welby, M.D.''
(1969-1976), for which he won a third.
</P>
<P>
   From the late 1940s, when ``Father Knows Best'' first hit the
radio waves, until Marcus Welby finally hung up his stethoscope,
Young epitomized what American dads and American doctors were
supposed to be like.
</P>
<P>
   Culturally speaking, the roles of the urbane Dr. Welby and the
small-town insurance agent Jim Anderson were nearly identical. The
gray-haired physician with the empathetic bedside manner, and the
father who always found time to dispense a gentle sermon or a sage
piece of advice, both provided the nation with the image of a
benign, Solomon-like authority during a period of Cold War tensions
and rising social turmoil.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a tremendously reassuring figure,'' said Steven Stark,
a commentator for National Public Radio and the author of ``Glued
to the Set: The 60 Television Shows and Events That Made Us Who We
Are Today'' (Free Press).
</P>
<P>
   ``Particularly in an era of great unrest in the culture, (CBS
news anchor) Walter Cronkite and Robert Young were pretty much the
same.''
</P>
<P>
   As a father, Jim Anderson was a far cry from the pleasantly
bumbling Fred MacMurray of ``My Three Sons,'' and further still
from the tyrannical Archie Bunker, the boorish Al Bundy or the
endearingly dysfunctional Homer Simpson.
</P>
<P>
   With elbow patches on his jacket and an avuncular twinkle in his
eye, Young's Anderson was the calm center of his household, a
9-to-5 guy who seemingly always left his cares at the office.
</P>
<P>
   While his wife Margaret was suffering remorse for overspending
on a new hat, or accidentally backing the car into the garage,
father Jim usually could be found in the kitchen, easing the
painful transitions into puberty of his eldest daughter, whom he
lovingly called ``Princess,'' while quietly setting a manly example
for his son, Bud.
</P>
<P>
   ``If America was looking for a father figure after World War II,
and I think it was, (Young) combined the best of the male and
female characteristics of parenting,'' said Michael T. Marsden,
dean of the college of arts and sciences at Northern Michigan
University and co-editor of the The Journal of Popular Film and
Television.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was always the counselor, certainly the disciplinarian when
that had to occur, but he was also the compassionate, understanding
disciplinarian.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Anderson, Dr. Welby was probably too good to exist outside
television. Unhampered by HMO bean-counters or breast-implant
lawsuits, he made house calls, treated superiors and underlings
with equal respect, and served as a mentor to his younger, funkier
colleague played by James Brolin.
</P>
<P>
   The show broke ground in addressing subjects like homosexuality
and drug abuse with greater sensitivity and depth than had been
seen on TV until then.
</P>
<P>
   Welby's hands-on style set a humanizing example for the field of
medicine, said Dr. Barbara Korsch, a professor of pediatrics at USC
and author of ``The Intelligent Patient's Guide to the
Doctor-Patient Relationship'' (Oxford University Press).
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, she lamented, in today's modern world of managed
health care, ``There's all kinds of technology interposed, not to
mention that everybody is so concerned about AIDS that nobody seems
to touch a patient anymore without rubber gloves.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Korsch cautioned that Welby fostered an unrealistic
expectation that no medical problem is so complex that it can't be
neatly wrapped up in an hour.
</P>
<P>
   ``Doctors are very success-oriented, and both doctors and
patients like short-term gratification, which was usually available
on the Marcus Welby show,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. John Nelson, a Utah physician and trustee of the American
Medical Association, described Welby ``as so warm, so kind, you'd
have the impression if you were his patient that he had nothing
else on his mind, you were his sole concern.''
</P>
<P>
   (SECOND TAKE FOLLOWS)
</P>
<P>
   ``(However) Marcus Welby had one patient a week. I have 40 or 50
a day.''
</P>
<P>
   When Young was in his acting prime, television generally held
dads and doctors in higher regard. Today's physicians are more
likely to be depicted as beleaguered technocrats, occasionally
heroic, often in crisis.
</P>
<P>
   As for fathers, you can take your pick between Al Bundy, Homer
Simpson, Tim Allen in ``Home Improvement'' and Dick Solomon of
``3rd Rock From the Sun,'' an extraterrestrial whose very sexuality
is ambiguous at best.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't think of a show on television where the person who's
nominally the authority figure hasn't been undermined,'' said Karal
Ann Marling, professor of art history and American Studies at the
University of Minnesota. ``Clearly we can't bear being told what to
do. Marcus Welby might be the last one on TV to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Is it any wonder some people may prefer the myth of a
beneficent, all-knowing patriarch to a world in which all
authority, from pediatricians to politicians, is suspect?
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a different type of world, it was a different type of
family,'' said Los Angeles child psychologist Robert Butterworth,
reflecting on Young's TV legacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question is, Is it better for us to see images that are
real, or images that are idealized?''

WEAK LINKS: SONS DON'T ALSO RISE

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Being paired with icon Arnold Palmer in today's
first round of the U.S. Senior Open at Riviera Country Club
shouldn't pose a problem for Bob Duval. He is so comfortable
playing in the shadow of another golfer he doesn't even seek the
sanctuary of his own identity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hello,'' he'll say to strangers, warmly extending his hand,
``I'm David Duval's father.''
</P>
<P>
   In a classic role reversal, Duval is playing catch-up to his
son, along with every other golfer on the planet. No one is on a
better roll right now than the 26-year-old Duval, who has two wins
this calendar year and eight top-10 finishes in 16 starts.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Duval wishes he could say his son is a chip off the old
block. But the fact of the matter is he's from an altogether
different mold.
</P>
<P>
   Duval, 51, didn't play professionally when his youngest son was
growing up. When he was David's age, he opted for a club pro's
position in Jacksonville, Fla., because the $50,000 annual salary
was more than all but the top 50 touring pros in the world were
earning at the time.
</P>
<P>
   It was a comfortable if not cushy existence. In the summer
months, especially, a club pro's hours are as long as the days. And
the demands of the country club set can leave club pros feeling
more like indentured servants than swing doctors.
</P>
<P>
   David Duval grew up observing all the hoops his father had to
jump through and it deepened his desire to one day be his own boss
on the golf course. He would be an independent contractor on the
PGA Tour or something else altogether.
</P>
<P>
   ``He saw how difficult it was answering to the Mrs. Murphys,''
Bob Duval said, ``and decided he didn't want any part of that.''
</P>
<P>
   Independence apparently is a powerful incentive. Long before
Duval ascended to the top of this year's PGA Tour money list with
$1.67 million and counting, the offspring of club pros were leaving
deep divots on the PGA Tour's landscape.
</P>
<P>
   Palmer's father was a club pro at Latrobe (Pa.) Country Club and
you'd have to have been lost in Riviera's rough all these years not
to know how Palmer's professional playing career turned out.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from Duval, other sons of teaching pros who have gone on
to win PGA titles include PGA Tour members Davis Love III, Vijah
Singh and Jim Gallagher Jr.
</P>
<P>
   Curiously, the sons of touring pros haven't fared nearly as
well. You'd think that success would breed success, but the truth
is, not many offspring over the years have been able to follow
their fathers' footsteps straight into the winner's circle.
</P>
<P>
   Think about it: baseball has Ken Griffey Jr.; golf has Dave
Stockton Jr., who has seven top-10 finishes in five years on the
PGA Tour. Basketball has Kobe Bryant; golf has Brent Geiberger, a
PGA Tour Rookie of the Year candidate in 1997 who tied for second
at the Phoenix Open in January but has missed the cut in six of his
last 11 tournaments.
</P>
<P>
   If you didn't know better, you'd think the PGA Tour had some
sort of nepotism policy. Among exempt PGA Tour members, Guy Boros
is the only son of a former PGA Tour champion who has won a tour
event.
</P>
<P>
   When Boros triumphed at the 1996 Vancouver Open, some two years
after the death of his father Julius, it was no minor victory.
Since 1951, only two other sons of PGA Tour winners, Joe Kirkwood
Jr. and Vance Heafner, have finished first in a PGA-sanctioned
event. It just goes to show, champions can't be reproduced as
easily as a set of knockoff irons.
</P>
<P>
   The golf ball clearly isn't impressed by bloodlines, or Gary
Nicklaus, the third of four sons of Jack, wouldn't be toiling in
obscurity on the European Tour and Robert Floyd, youngest son of
Raymond, wouldn't be paying his dues on the Nike Tour.
</P>
<P>
   ``Quite a few of us have had sons and very few have done really
well,'' said Dave Stockton, 56, the 1996 U.S. Senior Open champion.
``I'm just amazed more of our kids are not better players than they
are.''
</P>
<P>
   It could be that when the second generation tees it up, a number
of hazards come into play. Stockton wonders if many of them realize
how hard it is to make a good living at golf. It's a child's
prerogative to believe if dear old dad seemingly does it with the
greatest of ease, how hard can it be?
</P>
<P>
   Maybe they have no clue how many hours their dads spent working
to perfect their games before they came along and started hanging
out inside the gallery ropes. Maybe, as Stockton suggested, as the
kids of touring pros get older, ``some of us make it too easy on
them, getting them sponsor's exemptions or whatever.''
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe they're like Bryan Geiberger, another one of Al
Geiberger's sons, and grow tired of peoples' heightened
expectations.
</P>
<P>
   ``People sometimes see your name on a scoreboard and they assume
because you are a player's son, you should be better,'' said
Geiberger, 21, who is back playing the game after forsaking it for
a few years to pursue other sports.
</P>
<P>
   Bryan is caddying for his dad this week. Some day, perhaps,
he'll play on the PGA Tour. Or maybe he'll wait 29 years and join
the senior tour. In golf, all things are possible. &QL;

IT COULD BE A TWO-MAN SHOW

 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ A generation ago, it was Jack Nicklaus and Arnold
Palmer _ shooting it out for nearly every major championship on the
PGA Tour.
</P>
<P>
   They're in the field again this week for the 19th U.S. Senior
Open at Riviera Country Club. But this time, the big guns are Hale
Irwin and Gil Morgan _ the Jack and Arnie of their second-chance
era.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I had to pick a man right now, Gil's been in form,'' said
defending champion Graham Marsh. ``And I'm not saying that Hale
can't win the championship.''
</P>
<P>
   Between them, Irwin and Morgan have won eight of the 22 events
on the 1998 PGA Senior Tour (four apiece) and combined for more
than $3 million in official earnings in this year's age 50-and-over
competition.
</P>
<P>
   Marsh, hometown hero/putting wizard Dave Stockton, longtime
amateur star Jay Sigel and rookie phenom Larry Nelson could be
factors to the finish. So, too, might big-match player Raymond
Floyd or even the 58-year-old Nicklaus, who has won a combined 28
majors in the amateur, PGA Tour and PGA Senior Tour ranks.
</P>
<P>
   And don't rule out a long-shot champion in an event that has
produced upset Senior Open winners Larry Laoretti and Simon Hobday
in this decade. Marsh likes the chances of Australian David Graham.
Long-hitting John Jacobs, England's Brian Barnes and South Africa's
Hugh Baiocchi all have posted their initial senior tour wins within
the last year.
</P>
<P>
   But look for Morgan and Irwin to command at least as much
attention as Riviera's refurbished greens, its ball-eating kikuyu
rough and the capricious winds that can howl through the towering
eucalyptus on this storied Pacific Palisades course.
</P>
<P>
   Will this be a two-man race?
</P>
<P>
   Marsh thinks it might be, considering how Riviera is set up this
week _ 6,907 yards in length with fairways barely 40 yards wide,
3{-inch rough and greens nearing 11 on the stimpmeter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Morgan has the advantage here because of his length,'' said
the defending champion. ``Irwin has an advantage here because of
his great iron play.''
</P>
<P>
   Marsh thinks Riviera's greens, which have improved considerably
with the attention of new superintendent Paul Latshaw, could play a
large role.
</P>
<P>
   ``It becomes a little bit of a cliche to say it comes down to
putting,'' he said. ``If you don't bring your putting game with you
on a particular week, you can finish well. But on a golf course
like this, it's probably unlikely that you're going to win.''
</P>
<P>
   The way Marsh sees it, even a premier putter like tour leader
Irwin had best be at his best.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hale is a great putter, but even for Hale to win he has to
make clutch putts,'' Marsh said.
</P>
<P>
   Irwin likes to put first things first and worry about those
putts in their time.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to get there,'' said the man who leads the senior
tour in hitting greens in regulation. ``You have to hit the ball in
the fairway, and you have to hit the greens.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It is going to require keeping the ball in play,'' said
Morgan, who agrees with Irwin on the importance of hitting fairways
and greens.
</P>
<P>
   But Morgan disagrees with the notion this will be a two-man
race, even though he and Irwin rank among the top five in six of
the tour's 10 statistical categories.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know about that,'' he said of the two-man theory.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have got quite a few players that have played well here in
the past.''
</P>
<P>
   Former Riviera head pro Peter Oosterhuis suggests a third member
to the big two of Irwin and Morgan. He thinks Riviera might prove
the toughest competitor of all this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``The kikuyu grass can thrive in the summer,'' said Oosterhuis,
the former European Tour star who worked at Riviera from 1991-93.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can certainly remember having some impossible shots around
the greens, where it was a full swing to hit the ball 10 yards.''
</P>
<P>
   If not the kikuyu, it's the length.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pretty long on the card, and it is playing long,'' said
Oosterhuis, who thought a final score over par was not an
unreasonable expectation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it is possible,'' he said. ``It does depend a little
on the speed of the greens. If they get fractionally faster than
they are, that will affect the scoring immediately.''

L.A. POLICE CITE NET THREAT TO KIDS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  &HT;     BY PATRICK McGREEVY AND DOUGLAS HABERMAN  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Saying that arrests for Internet-related crimes
against children in Los Angeles are up 150 percent over last year,
Police Chief Bernard Parks warned parents to watch their
youngsters' computer use more closely.
</P>
<P>
   Because if they don't, pedophiles certainly will.
</P>
<P>
   ``Young people have been enticed to meet pedophiles, or they are
sent a bus ticket,'' Parks said during a news conference Wednesday.
``These are things we think come about from unsupervised
activity.''
</P>
<P>
   Parks said an ``explosion'' in the number of home computers has
given pedophiles infinitely more opportunity to troll the Internet
for new victims and trade photos.
</P>
<P>
   So far this year, the LAPD unit that handles sex crimes against
children says it has arrested 15 people for computer-related crimes
involving minors _ compared to six arrests last year _ and is
investigating 14 other reports.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the anonymity of the Internet, police are unsure
exactly how many pedophiles lurk in cyberspace, but they said
detectives constantly are busy trying to outfox computer-savvy
molesters.
</P>
<P>
   ``We get cases every day,'' said Detective Raul Galindo of the
Los Angeles Police Department's Child Sexual Exploitation Unit.
``This is new, and this is more underground than anything else.''
</P>
<P>
   The unit has five detectives that handle sex crimes against
minors, the same as last year despite the growing problem. But none
of them can devote time exclusively to Internet porn, said
Detective Bill Dworin, head of the child sex crime unit.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need a computer nerd in here,'' Dworin said.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time that many parents are caught unaware by the
dangers of the Internet, the city also is grappling with how _ and
whether _ to control online access in public libraries.
</P>
<P>
   Library policy now places the responsibility for restricting
children's Internet access on their parents and guardians. A June 9
memorandum from the City Attorney's Office recommends that if any
revision is planned, it should be an interim policy to protect
children from obscene materials without infringing the rights of
adult library patrons. The City Council's Arts, Health and
Humanities Committee is scheduled to revisit the issue Aug. 12.
</P>
<P>
   Internet-related crime against children falls generally into
several categories: the downloading, distribution and production of
photographs and pornographic material, and the solicitation of
minors through ``chat rooms'' and bulletin boards.
</P>
<P>
   New technology has allowed pedophiles to scan pictures into
computers at home and even take videotape and send it anywhere on
the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now it's material that we have never seen before. These are
children who are being molested now,'' Dworin said. ``These are
children we are trying to identify.''
</P>
<P>
   In one case, a 13-year-old Los Angeles girl was lured into
meeting a man from San Diego to have sex, and she was molested
while a video camera captured it, Dworin said.
</P>
<P>
   Just last week, the LAPD arrested veteran rock guitarist Robert
``Waddy'' Wachtel and his wife, Annie, on suspicion of possessing
child pornography. Police said they found illegal images on his
computer.
</P>
<P>
   ``The victims were are dealing with often lack attention and
affection at home,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We tell our children don't talk to strangers,'' Dworin said.
``We then give the child a computer and put it in their bedroom to
be used as a baby-sitting tool and frequently parents have no idea
who their children are contacting in the various chat rooms.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the Internet spans the world, Dworin said detectives
have found that many pedophiles and networks of them operate out of
Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``One investigation may easily lead to many others based upon
what is found on computers,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to laws against physical molestation of children,
Dworin said it is illegal to use sexual language in computer
conversations with children. Upon a second conviction of that
misdemeanor law, the person must register as a sex offender, Dworin
said.
</P>
<P>
   Other crimes that have led to arrests by his unit include
distribution of child pornography for commercial purposes and
production of child pornography. The latter crime, if for private
viewing, is a misdemeanor and could lead to one year in jail; if
for commercial purposes, a conviction would draw a maximum sentence
of eight years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Computer technology, however, also can be used to block children
from viewing unacceptable material. But child advocates said that
parents themselves are the best guardians.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet can be a powerful learning tool but ``in order to
keep it like it is, parents have got to keep kids away from the
dangers,'' said Jayne Murphy Shapiro, founder and president of
Granada Hills-based Kids Safe, an advocacy group on child safety
education.
</P>
<P>
   Educate your children to the dangers, set rules and impose
discipline if they break them _ just like for any other activity,
said Shapiro.
</P>
<P>
   ``Parents do not have to know how to use a computer _ but they
do have to teach their kids when they're on it to be very
careful,'' she said.

WORLD OF ANDERSON, WELBY ONE OF SAGE ADVICE, COMPASSION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY REED JOHNSON  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Robert Young wasn't a real doctor, though he
played one on television.
</P>
<P>
   Nor in real life was Young always the calm, unshakable pillar of
paternal wisdom he appeared to be in ``Father Knows Best,'' a role
that stamped him as a mass-market swami of nuclear-family values.
</P>
<P>
   Off camera, the resident of Westlake Village northwest of Los
Angeles, who died Tuesday at age 91, suffered from terrible bouts
of depression and alcoholism.
</P>
<P>
   But to a generation of TV viewers, Young was the ultimate
paterfamilias, a gentle, infallible arbiter both of minor domestic
crises and life-or-death medical matters.
</P>
<P>
   Though he enjoyed substantial success as a film actor, appearing
in such memorable movies as ``Sitting Pretty,'' ``Strange
Interlude,'' ``Northwest Passage'' and ``Journey for Margaret,'' it
was within the cozier confines of television that Young's warmth
and humanity truly shone.
</P>
<P>
   And it was on television that he left his deepest imprint on
popular culture, first in ``Father Knows Best'' (1954-1963), for
which he won two Emmys, then for ``Marcus Welby, M.D.''
(1969-1976), for which he won a third.
</P>
<P>
   From the late 1940s, when ``Father Knows Best'' first hit the
radio waves, until Marcus Welby finally hung up his stethoscope,
Young epitomized what American dads and American doctors were
supposed to be like.
</P>
<P>
   Culturally speaking, the roles of the urbane Dr. Welby and the
small-town insurance agent Jim Anderson were nearly identical. The
gray-haired physician with the empathetic bedside manner, and the
father who always found time to dispense a gentle sermon or a sage
piece of advice, both provided the nation with the image of a
benign, Solomon-like authority during a period of Cold War tensions
and rising social turmoil.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a tremendously reassuring figure,'' said Steven Stark,
a commentator for National Public Radio and the author of ``Glued
to the Set: The 60 Television Shows and Events That Made Us Who We
Are Today'' (Free Press).
</P>
<P>
   ``Particularly in an era of great unrest in the culture, (CBS
news anchor) Walter Cronkite and Robert Young were pretty much the
same.''
</P>
<P>
   As a father, Jim Anderson was a far cry from the pleasantly
bumbling Fred MacMurray of ``My Three Sons,'' and further still
from the tyrannical Archie Bunker, the boorish Al Bundy or the
endearingly dysfunctional Homer Simpson.
</P>
<P>
   With elbow patches on his jacket and an avuncular twinkle in his
eye, Young's Anderson was the calm center of his household, a
9-to-5 guy who seemingly always left his cares at the office.
</P>
<P>
   While his wife Margaret was suffering remorse for overspending
on a new hat, or accidentally backing the car into the garage,
father Jim usually could be found in the kitchen, easing the
painful transitions into puberty of his eldest daughter, whom he
lovingly called ``Princess,'' while quietly setting a manly example
for his son, Bud.
</P>
<P>
   ``If America was looking for a father figure after World War II,
and I think it was, (Young) combined the best of the male and
female characteristics of parenting,'' said Michael T. Marsden,
dean of the college of arts and sciences at Northern Michigan
University and co-editor of the The Journal of Popular Film and
Television.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was always the counselor, certainly the disciplinarian when
that had to occur, but he was also the compassionate, understanding
disciplinarian.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Anderson, Dr. Welby was probably too good to exist outside
television. Unhampered by HMO bean-counters or breast-implant
lawsuits, he made house calls, treated superiors and underlings
with equal respect, and served as a mentor to his younger, funkier
colleague played by James Brolin.
</P>
<P>
   The show broke ground in addressing subjects like homosexuality
and drug abuse with greater sensitivity and depth than had been
seen on TV until then.
</P>
<P>
   Welby's hands-on style set a humanizing example for the field of
medicine, said Dr. Barbara Korsch, a professor of pediatrics at USC
and author of ``The Intelligent Patient's Guide to the
Doctor-Patient Relationship'' (Oxford University Press).
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, she lamented, in today's modern world of managed
health care, ``There's all kinds of technology interposed, not to
mention that everybody is so concerned about AIDS that nobody seems
to touch a patient anymore without rubber gloves.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Korsch cautioned that Welby fostered an unrealistic
expectation that no medical problem is so complex that it can't be
neatly wrapped up in an hour.
</P>
<P>
   ``Doctors are very success-oriented, and both doctors and
patients like short-term gratification, which was usually available
on the Marcus Welby show,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. John Nelson, a Utah physician and trustee of the American
Medical Association, described Welby ``as so warm, so kind, you'd
have the impression if you were his patient that he had nothing
else on his mind, you were his sole concern.''
</P>
<P>
   (SECOND TAKE FOLLOWS)
</P>
<P>
   ``(However) Marcus Welby had one patient a week. I have 40 or 50
a day.''

   When Young was in his acting prime, television generally held
dads and doctors in higher regard. Today's physicians are more
likely to be depicted as beleaguered technocrats, occasionally
heroic, often in crisis.
</P>
<P>
   As for fathers, you can take your pick between Al Bundy, Homer
Simpson, Tim Allen in ``Home Improvement'' and Dick Solomon of
``3rd Rock From the Sun,'' an extraterrestrial whose very sexuality
is ambiguous at best.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't think of a show on television where the person who's
nominally the authority figure hasn't been undermined,'' said Karal
Ann Marling, professor of art history and American Studies at the
University of Minnesota. ``Clearly we can't bear being told what to
do. Marcus Welby might be the last one on TV to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Is it any wonder some people may prefer the myth of a
beneficent, all-knowing patriarch to a world in which all
authority, from pediatricians to politicians, is suspect?
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a different type of world, it was a different type of
family,'' said Los Angeles child psychologist Robert Butterworth,
reflecting on Young's TV legacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question is, Is it better for us to see images that are
real, or images that are idealized?''

PAIR TRIED TO SELL `SERIAL KILLER' TALE; NOW WOMAN FACES MURDER
CHARGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRISTINA LEONARD  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Last week, Russell and Dominique Keys tried in vain to sell the
tabloids a lurid story about Russell being a British serial killer.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Dominique Keys sat in a Maricopa County jail
facing first-degree murder charges for reportedly killing her
husband.
</P>
<P>
   Dominique, 54, was arrested Tuesday afternoon after police say
she fatally shot 40-year-old Russell at a friend's house near 30th
Street and McDowell Road in Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   The woman told police her husband had earlier confessed to
murdering five women in England. In fact, the couple had tried to
sell the story to two tabloids: Florida-based ``National Examiner''
and London's ``Sun,'' Phoenix police Detective Frank DiModica said.
</P>
<P>
   However, police are treating the case as a domestic violence
related homicide.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happened in England is something that really isn't a
factor in this investigation right now,'' DiModica said.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Williams, editor of ``National Examiner,'' said Wednesday
that Russell called the Florida-based tabloid from Phoenix this
week claiming he was a serial killer.
</P>
<P>
   ``He talked to a reporter for a fair amount of time,'' Williams
said. ``It was a rather detailed interview.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams said the tabloid didn't pay for the story because it
could not immediately confirm the facts; the couple and the tabloid
never negotiated a deal. However, ``National Examiner'' plans to
run a story at the end of this month.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a preposterous story to begin with,'' the editor said.
``It needed a lot of checking out.``
</P>
<P>
   Williams said Dominique was ``obviously concerned'' about her
husband's alleged behavior and wanted to turn him in to law
enforcement. However, Russell told the tabloid that he had tried to
surrender himself once in England, but police did not believe him.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman with the police department in Blackpool, England,
would say little about Russell Keys on Wednesday, but acknowledged
its contact with him.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can confirm that Mr. Keys was interviewed by officers at
Blackpool police station on the 26th of June this year in
connection with information regarding possible serious offenses in
Lancashire and elsewhere,'' according to a department statement.
``Extensive inquiries were made at that time, which failed to
corroborate any of the information the police have received.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Keys was released, and at the time of his death no
proceedings have been instigated against him nor were any
anticipated.''
</P>
<P>
   According to court documents, the couple recently moved to
Arizona from Stroud, Gloucestershire, which is about 100 miles from
London.
</P>
<P>
   Dominique, who is a U.S. citizen, told police that she and her
husband were arguing Tuesday afternoon at the home of a friend,
Paul Gilligan, when her husband came at her as if to choke her.
</P>
<P>
   She pushed him away, and when he tried to attack her again, she
grabbed a loaded 9mm handgun from a duffel bag, which she had
bought that day for protection ``because she lived in a bad
neighborhood,'' according to the documents.
</P>
<P>
   Gilligan, who called 911, told police he was in the bedroom when
the shooting occurred: ``She's sitting here talking to him,
standing here talking to him _ screaming at him,'' according to the
911 tape.
</P>
<P>
   Gilligan told police that he is a friend of Dominique Keys and
allowed the couple to stay at his home. He could not be reached for
comment Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Police said Dominique had no visible signs of trauma or evidence
she was attacked by her husband. She was being held in lieu of
$450,000 bail.  &QL;

Transition May Mean Trouble  c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BURLINGAME, Calif. _ This was the third time in a year and a
half the 49ers rented a hotel ballroom to announce that someone was
giving up a position with the organization that he loved.
</P>
<P>
   If history has taught us anything, it's that patience will be
required to sort out the real meaning behind Wednesday's
developments.
</P>
<P>
   You might remember that when George Seifert stepped down as the
team's coach in January 1997, he insisted earnestly that he could
have continued in the job _ and even gotten a contract extension if
he wanted it. Eddie DeBartolo later said that was not the case.
</P>
<P>
   And last December, when DeBartolo stepped aside as managing
owner pending the outcome of legal proceedings in Louisiana, we
were told it would be ``business as usual'' because Carmen Policy
would become a minority owner of the team.
</P>
<P>
   We now know, of course, that never happened.
</P>
<P>
   So Wednesday, when the phrase ``business as usual'' was heard
again at yet another 49ers press conference, we were left to ponder
just what that meant with regard to the team.
</P>
<P>
   As always, they went to great lengths to put the best possible
spin on the show.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to be one of the most stable organizations in
professional football,'' claimed Larry Thrailkill, the Nashville
attorney who takes over for Policy as the team's interim chief
executive.
</P>
<P>
   Depends on how you define stable, I guess. In less than two
years, the 49ers have changed head coaches, offensive coordinators,
defensive coordinators and now club presidents. They have at least
six projected new starters in their on-field lineup this season.
They have undergone transition in their personnel department. Hard
to believe, but Dwight Clark is now the team's longest-tenured
high-ranking football management employee.
</P>
<P>
   For nigh on a decade, pundits have predicted the end of the
49ers' dynasty. No one could have foreseen that the mortal wounds
might be self-inflicted, but how else to describe the sequence of
recent events?
</P>
<P>
   There are three reasons the 49ers have managed to stall a
serious downfall for so long.
</P>
<P>
   Partly, it's the weak opposition in their division; among them,
the Saints, Falcons and Rams have had four winning seasons out of a
possible 24 in the '90s.
</P>
<P>
   Partly, it had to do with Bill Walsh's prescience, trading for
Steve Young in 1987 when he still had Joe Montana. No NFL team ever
made a smoother transition at quarterback, and that's the area that
caused many past dynasties to founder. Walsh saw greatness in Young
at a time many of the personnel experts in the NFL saw nothing.
</P>
<P>
   But mostly, the 49ers stayed strong because their organization
was so strong, so together. Sure, they were backed by DeBartolo's
deep pockets, but they also always seemed to know what move to
make. They made their share of mistakes, certainly, but when they
screwed one up, they usually cut their losses and moved on, and
there were rarely any recriminations.
</P>
<P>
   Significantly, whenever the 49ers made a decision or a move, it
was always presented as an ``organizational'' event. When they
explained things, they always spoke with a single voice. Nobody
really believed it, but they came as close as any team could to
making outsiders think there was never any internal dissent. If the
Soviets were as good at crushing internal dissent as the 49ers, the
Berlin Wall might still be standing.
</P>
<P>
   Even those who left the front office or the coaching staff never
had a bad word to say about the organization. The 49ers didn't
invent the golden handshake, but at least in the NFL, they surely
perfected it. Policy won't leave empty-handed, either.
</P>
<P>
   Now, that facade is forever shattered, and, more than anything
else, it presages a different era for the 49ers.
</P>
<P>
   It won't be hard for them to find a new chief executive, whether
it is Bill Walsh or someone else, with a better knowledge of and
background in football than Policy. Within the next year and a
half, it could even be Mike Holmgren, who has found Green Bay too
confining and longs for a chance to run an organization.
</P>
<P>
   They won't, however, find someone who can be a smoother voice
for the organization or present a better image than Policy. Few in
sports work a crowd better than Policy, who, typically, tried to
soften the occasion Thursday by opening with a joke.
</P>
<P>
   Until that someone is in place, Clark will be under a
microscope. His influence has grown in the past year or two, as
Policy became distracted by league matters and the pursuit of a new
San Francisco stadium. Now, even with an interim CEO, Clark has
gone all the way from all-pro player to the top of the
organizational chart.
</P>
<P>
   And even here, there's a question worth asking. We all know
DeBartolo and Clark were close when Clark was playing. But no one
knows where that relationship stands now. Clark is a team player,
and in the recent past, he played for Policy's front-office team.
If DeBartolo gets back in control, will his relationship with Clark
again be what it was?
</P>
<P>
   For that matter, coach Steve Mariucci really was hired by
Policy, not DeBartolo. So were executives like Bill Duffy, the
business vice president and chief financial officer. What happens
if DeBartolo comes back? What happens to personnel boss Vinny
Cerrato if Walsh, who has been privately critical of many 49ers
personnel decisions in recent years, comes in?
</P>
<P>
   Many questions. Few answers.
</P>
<P>
   For the immediate future, the 49ers have a bigger problem than
their front office, anyway. They remain a team in transition.
Players like Young and Jerry Rice will be gone long before that
planned stadium is built, if in fact it ever is built. The next
quarterback transition can't possibly be as successful as the last
one and, even if Rice makes it all the way back from his two
surgeries, how long can he go?
</P>
<P>
   Strange isn't it? With Walsh and Montana and Rice and Ronnie
Lott, four present or future Hall of Famers, the good times rolled
on for the 49ers. But it looks like the punctuation mark on the end
of an era will not involve a player, but the departure of Policy.

SHEFFIELD UNDETERRED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MARC J. SPEARS  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The Dodgers' Gary Sheffield is expecting a better
outcome than his sparring partner Jason Kendall of the Pittsburgh
Pirates.
</P>
<P>
   After a collision at the plate on June 28, Sheffield and the
Pirates' catcher were involved in a fight that provoked a
bench-clearing brawl. Both were later given three-game suspensions
that they decided to appeal. On Tuesday, however, Kendall was put
on immediate three-game suspension after National League president
Leonard S. Coleman Jr. upheld the penalty.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the ruling on Kendall, Sheffield said Wednesday he feels
confident he will be cleared from serving his suspension when he
receives his ruling in New York before the Dodgers meet the Mets on
Aug. 3. Sheffield has said he was provoked to fight after Kendall
shouted obscenities at him. Kendall won't be eligible to play again
until Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think my chances are good,' said Sheffield, who went to UCLA
Medical Center after suffering a cut above his left eyelid during
the fight. ``If they really want to know the facts, they can look
at the tape and get it resolved. I don't see (myself) losing. I
know I'm totally right and there is no reason to think negative.''
</P>
<P>
   If the suspension is upheld immediately on Aug. 3, he would miss
the game against the Mets that night and two games at Montreal on
Aug. 4-5.
</P>
<P>
   Dodgers manager Glenn Hoffman said, ``I hope it works out for
him. Especially with the way he is playing.'
</P>
<P>
   Wagner gets attention: Houston closer Billy Wagner, who was
struck in the head by a line drive at Arizona on July 15, did not
accompany the team to Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Wagner, who suffered a concussion and a soft-tissue injury to
his left ear, was placed on the 15-day disabled list Monday. The
left-hander, who was bothered by dizziness and headaches after the
incident, has been prescribed a series of light physical exercises,
including jogging and weights.
</P>
<P>
   Wagner, who is sixth in the National League in saves with 22,
will be a guest on ``ESPN UpClose'' today at 3 p.m. via satellite
from his home.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to get hit in the head for people to know who I am,''
said Wagner jokingly on Monday. ``I was 22 for 24 in saves and I
couldn't get on that show. I get hit in the head and now I am
there. Go figure.'
</P>
<P>
   Jarrin live: Baseball announcer Jaime Jarrin's induction into
the Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, N.Y., on July 26 will be
broadcast by KWKW-AM (1330) from 11 a.m. to 1 p.m. Jarrin, who is
in the midst of his 40th season as the ``Spanish voice of the
Dodgers,'' is also the 1998 recipient of the Ford C. Frick
broadcast award, presented annually to a broadcaster for
contribution to baseball broadcasting.

More Drama Unloaded on 49ers  By C.W. NEVIUS  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
    BURLINGAME, Calif. _ And so, in the end, everyone loses. When
team president Carmen Policy announced his resignation from the
49ers Wednesday, the shock waves shuddered through the
organization.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Policy has to leave the team he loves, the 49ers' players _
rousted out of bed at 11 Tuesday night to hear the news from coach
Steve Mariucci _ are wondering what hit them, and Eddie DeBartolo
continues to mutter darkly to himself about conspiracy theories and
hidden agendas.
</P>
<P>
   This isn't a football team, it's ``Hamlet.'' Alas, poor Carmen,
we knew him well.
</P>
<P>
   And we haven't even gotten to Act V yet, where the story starts
to make sense, even if it turns out that some of our favorite
characters aren't going to make the final curtain.
</P>
<P>
   The strangest thing that we can say about the future of the
49ers is that it has nothing to do with Jerry Rice's knee, Steve
Young's elbow or whether or not they fumble against the Green Bay
Packers. This whole franchise is left in limbo, waiting to see what
happens with a Louisiana grand jury that continues to sit silently
in judgment of Eddie DeBartolo.
</P>
<P>
   There have been reports that something is about to break down
there in the bayou, and that certainly would explain some of what
happened Wednesday. If it is true that DeBartolo has managed to
find a way to put the allegations to rest, you can see why Policy
would grab his Armani jacket and head out the door.
</P>
<P>
   Simply put, he was gone anyhow if Eddie regained control of the
team _ the feud between them was that bitter. Ever since Policy was
forced to handle the old scoop shovel during the stadium ballot
issue, with Eddie and his advisers playing the part of the
elephant, the relationship has been strained.
</P>
<P>
   Policy cleaned up the messes, and the stadium bill passed, but
it wasn't much fun. By the start of last season, Policy had
acquired his own private box for 49ers games so he and Eddie
wouldn't have to sit together.
</P>
<P>
   And let's be honest, once DeBartolo got into trouble with the
feds, there is every reason to think that Policy did some serious
research into putting together the financing that could buy the
team. There are people who will tell you that he had a deal set to
go and had made a pitch to Denise DeBartolo York.
</P>
<P>
   At that point, it looked like a no-lose situation for the
organization. If Eddie escaped the clutches of the government,
everything would run as it had, with DeBartolo writing the checks
and Policy running the front office. If something bad happened in
Louisiana, Policy was there to take over the team and they wouldn't
miss a beat.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, we have this. Policy is out, DeBartolo continues to
twist in the Louisiana wind, and DeBartolo York has been ``forced''
_ her word _ to run the team. DeBartolo York's guy, corporate
lawyer Larry Thrailkill, who flew in Thursday to take charge, made
it clear that he was as surprised as anyone to be CEO of a
five-time Super Bowl winner.
</P>
<P>
   ``Twenty-four hours ago,'' Thrailkill drawled, ``I was minding
my own business.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, I hope you're a quick study, Larry, because business is
booming _ and not in a good way, either.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Thrailkill seems like a nice-enough chap. Thrown into
the media whirlpool, he sat there next to Policy Thursday and hit a
few nice volleys as reporters took their best shots. After all, it
isn't as if he doesn't know anything about the game _ ``I played in
high school,'' he said, getting a nice laugh.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the tone Thursday couldn't have been more polite and
cordial, which is often the case at a formal beheading.
</P>
<P>
   Policy, of course, set his famous charm on ``stun,'' and not
only thanked everyone present, he went out of his way to say kind
things about his former friend, wishing Eddie the best of luck and
graciously leaving the door open to a reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
   DeBartolo York, in a long, formal statement, also took the high
road, saying she was ``both surprised and disappointed'' when
Policy offered his resignation. She thanked him for past
contributions and wished him well ``in his future endeavors.''
</P>
<P>
   Eddie, meanwhile, managed to cough out a 26-word farewell to
Policy on a single piece of plain, white paper, which read as if it
had been pulled from his mouth with pliers: ``Carmen leaves our
organization with my best personal wishes. He has been an integral
part of the 49ers' success since we named him president in 1991.''
He had more to say, but that was all he devoted to his buddy.
</P>
<P>
   But this is just the beginning of a long, tangled tale. Now that
we have set the scene, all we can do is sit back and wait to see
how it unspools. There are games to play, federal marshals to
answer and a struggle for power.
</P>
<P>
   What's next? Well, at least one source Thursday said we
shouldn't hold our breath waiting for Bill Walsh to be asked back.
Walsh is interested, he said, ``but he may not get the
opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   Stay tuned. All we know so far is that if something really bad
happens in that Louisiana courtroom, and if the 49ers' ship begins
to take on water, Policy won't be around.
</P>
<P>
   That lifeboat just left. Someone strike up ``Nearer My God to
Thee.''

PHOENIX ABORTION CLINIC TO BE EVICTED, LANDLORD SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JODIE SNYDER AND SUSIE STECKNER  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ The landlord of a controversial Phoenix abortion
clinic said Wednesday that he will evict his tenant, which has come
under fire after the recent death of a patient and a failed
abortion that ended in the delivery of a full-term baby.
</P>
<P>
   And the state Board of Nursing confirmed Wednesday that it is
looking into whether licensed nurses were involved in the April
death of a woman at the A-Z Women's Center on East McDowell Road or
in the June delivery of a 37-week-old baby that a doctor believed
was only 23 weeks old.
</P>
<P>
   Joey Ridenour, nursing board director, said her office doesn't
know whether any nurses were involved but decided it needed to
investigate.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the Arizona Board of Medical Examiners suspended the
license of Dr. John Biskind, the doctor involved in the cases. His
suspension is pending a hearing by the state Office of
Administrative Hearings, which is expected to meet in 30 to 60
days.
</P>
<P>
   The Maricopa County Attorney's Office and the Phoenix Police
Department also are investigating Biskind for possible criminal
charges.
</P>
<P>
   Their investigation centers around the death of 33-year-old
LouAnne Herron, who bled to death after receiving an abortion from
Biskind in April. Police and prosecutors also are examining the
case of the baby that Biskind nearly aborted in June. It received
lacerations and a skull facture in the process. She will be adopted
by a Texas couple.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, the state medical board censured Biskind for gross
negligence after another patient bled to death.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, the landlord of the A-Z Center, who asked that his
name not be used, said, ``They will shortly be leaving. We're
giving the time that they are allowed under the law.'' He declined
to comment further.
</P>
<P>
   His statement directly contradicted those of clinic personnel,
who insisted Wednesday that A-Z was remaining open despite reports
to the contrary.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what the media is saying. We're not closing,'' said the
administrator, who declined to give her name.
</P>
<P>
   The owner of A-Z, Dr. Moshe Hachamovitch of New York, also
operates two clinics _ on 27th Avenue in west Phoenix and on
Scottsdale Road in Scottsdale _ under the name Family Planning
Institute. The McDowell Road administrator said neither of those
clinics is closing.
</P>
<P>
   At the Scottsdale center, however, shelves were empty Wednesday,
and cardboard boxes filled the reception area. Employees said they
were cleaning and declined further comment. They said the center
was not seeing patients Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   An employee at the 27th Avenue clinic referred all calls about
appointments to the McDowell Road center.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Brian Finkel, a Phoenix doctor who provides abortions, said
his office received calls Wednesday from women who had been turned
away from A-Z.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are being told that their doctor is supposedly ill and
they will have to reschedule their appointment somewhere else,''
Finkel said. &QL;

CARDINALS SPARKING FANS' HOPES  
 OFF-SEASON MOVES BRING SMILES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)

<P>
   FLAGSTAFF, Ariz. _ The argument started on a dusty, softball
field and then moved to the Dirty Drummer bar in Tempe.
</P>
<P>
   A longtime Cardinals basher announced to all who would listen
that the team, 4-12 last season, would stink again this year.
</P>
<P>
   A Cardinals official watched in amazement as the bar patrons
shouted down the skeptic.
</P>
<P>
   ``They jumped on him and said how good the Cardinals are going
to be,'' the team official said. ``I've never seen that happen
before.''
</P>
<P>
   Cardinals fever, catch it.
</P>
<P>
   It's a 14-year veteran offensive tackle buying season tickets
for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   Lomas Brown, a seven-time Pro Bowl selection, picked up his five
season tickets, four in the loge section, Wednesday before he drove
up the mountain for today's start of training camp.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's my first time buying tickets,'' Brown said after arriving
in Flagstaff. ``I haven't been this excited in a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   Defensive tackle Eric Swann also has the spirit. He bought two
season tickets.
</P>
<P>
   Swann can afford it. He signed a five-year, $25 million contract
in the off-season that included a $7.5 million signing bonus.
</P>
<P>
   Rookie defensive end Andre Wadsworth, the team's unsigned
first-round draft pick, might get even a bigger bonus than Swann.
That's because former Michigan cornerback Charles Woodson received
an $8 million signing bonus when he signed with the Oakland Raiders
on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Swann said he didn't care whether Wadsworth gets the biggest
signing bonus in team history.
</P>
<P>
   This is Camp Happy. The more money, the merrier.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't worry about that,'' Swann said. ``To me, that's
immature. You have to be happy with what you can get.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'll see my dimples and smiles all year long. I'm happy with
my contract.''
</P>
<P>
   Optimism abounds. Swann said that everywhere he has gone in the
Valley during the off-season, fans are talking about the new and
improved team.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are excited because they like what the organization is
doing _ the trades, the free agents, shuffling in the draft to get
good players and another great pick (from San Diego) next year,''
Swann said. ``Fans see that these are smart moves.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week's edition of ``The Sporting News'' ranked the
Cardinals as having the best off-season in the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Ferguson, vice president of player personnel, is credited
for many of the moves.
</P>
<P>
   Ferguson, who helped build Super Bowl teams at Buffalo and
Denver, said he knows there is great anticipation going into this
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm ready to go,'' Ferguson said. ``Unfortunately, I'm too old
and too fat to put on pads. We have got to finish what we started.
. . . We've got to finish these games and show we know how to
win.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals suffered their first four losses a year ago by a
total of 11 points.
</P>
<P>
   But that was before Arizona State product Jake Plummer became
the starting quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since I've been here, the fans never have really liked the
(starting) quarterback,'' said outside linebacker Jamir Miller, the
fifth-year pro. ``Now they have Jake, whom they love. They feel
we're finally getting over the hump.''
</P>
<P>
   Randy Beyer, who manages the Sportsfan sporting goods store in
the Arizona Center, said Plummer mania is infectious.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a quarterback who only played a half a year, we just sold
our last authentic (Plummer) jersey,'' he said. ``We have replicas.
It's the most popular jersey of any NFL player in stock.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyer said store patrons are excited about the upcoming season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been (in the Valley) for 10 years and always have seen
the darkness lurking behind the team's brightest moments,'' he
said. ``The only other time people were this excited was Buddy
Ryan's first year (1994). He fell flat on his face and then people
turned on them.''
</P>
<P>
   But Ryan didn't have Plummer, who set most of the team's rookie
quarterback records last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe expectations are a little too high,'' said Greg Gennaro,
who runs Diamond Cleaners in Tempe, only a few blocks away from the
team's training facility.
</P>
<P>
   ``But, absolutely, people are excited. I've heard so many
positive things. People like the draft and feel Jake Plummer is the
one to get them over the top.'' &QL;

CARDS LOSE VET ERAN SAFETY MALONE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By LEE SHAPPELL  
 and STEVE SCHOENFELD  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   FLAGSTAFF, Ariz. _ The Cardinals had been riding a wave of
optimism and good fortune through the off-season. And then reality
hit.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, as players reported for training camp, they got a
nasty surprise when safety Van Malone, a starter for the Detroit
Lions last year, failed his physical because of a hip injury. He
was released.
</P>
<P>
   With Brent Alexander and Matt Darby, the Cardinals' starting
safeties the past two seasons, gone, Malone was being counted upon
to contend for a starting position.
</P>
<P>
   Malone suffered abdominal injuries at Detroit, but when the
Cardinals signed him, he was healthy and set to play. He
participated in the team's minicamp and veterans camp in May. But
according to team officials, he suffered the hip injury in an
off-season workout.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is something we kind of anticipated the past couple of
weeks,'' Coach Vince Tobin said. ``It never got any better.''
</P>
<P>
   Malone was to receive $397,000 on a make-good contract with no
signing bonus, so the Cardinals will suffer no salary cap
repercussions by letting him go.
</P>
<P>
   But the stunning news leaves the team scrambling at a position
that already was of prime concern. Kwamie Lassiter, who played
sparingly during his first three seasons with the Cardinals, signed
his one-year contract Wednesday and now is the projected starting
free safety. He would be backed by Kenny Harris, who made the team
as an undrafted rookie last year, and rookie Pat Tillman, a
seventh-round pick from Arizona State.
</P>
<P>
   Lassiter has played mostly on special teams and in nickel and
dime coverages. Harris played primarily on special teams the final
11 games after spending the first five on the practice squad.
Tillman is making the switch from linebacker.
</P>
<P>
   The contenders at strong safety are Tommy Bennett and rookie
Corey Chavous, who as of Wednesday night had not signed his
contract.
</P>
<P>
   In Tobin's defense, the safety positions are nearly
interchangeable, so there could be switching in the wake of the
Malone news. The club likely will shop for a veteran safety. Among
those unsigned and available are Darby, Chris Shelling, David
Hendrix and Brian Walker. &QL;

`ORGANIZED CONFUSION' MARKS FOX SPORTS NEWS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM GINTONIO  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Most of the people in the room are trying to keep
a straight face.
</P>
<P>
   It's show time on the set of Fox Sports News, and Van Earl
Wright, his voice booming and his shock of white hair plastered in
place, is on the air. And that means sports with a chuckle. As he
rattles off the day's sports highlights, everyone is anticipating
the punch line.
</P>
<P>
   But as he makes those around him laugh, he also tries to improve
the product. He's constantly asking personnel on the set to come up
with more information, right now, for the next segment one minute
away. Everyone seems to be running to, or away from, Wright most of
the time.
</P>
<P>
   Call it organized confusion most of the night for ``Fox Sports
News'' ``Primetime,'' a freewheeling, constantly changing five-hour
romp. Anchors keep changing, producers, directors and reporters
hold impromptu hallway meetings, jiggling here, juggling there,
always tweaking.
</P>
<P>
   Take all the mantras, the philosophies and the pep talks and
throw them out the window. It all boils down to a simple bottom
line for everyone: no clunkers.
</P>
<P>
   When John Terenzio, senior vice president and executive producer
of Fox Sports News, wrote the credo that stressed its sports
reports were fresh hour after hour, there was something else
buzzing around his brain.
</P>
<P>
   ``Others can have a ton of clunker shows,'' he said. ``Not us.
We have to be good every single time if we want the viewers to come
back. It's a fun burden.''
</P>
<P>
   The burden has been lightened a bit, with Fox Sports Net viewed
in almost 61 million homes (including 1 million on Fox Sports
Arizona), up from 27 million in its first 18 months, but the shadow
of others, namely ESPN's ``SportsCenter,'' is never far away.
</P>
<P>
   ``SportsCenter'' is seen in almost 74 million households, but
its format is far different than the one employed by Fox.
</P>
<P>
   The dividing line is that ``Fox Sports News'' ``Primetime'' is
regionally sensitive; lead stories, the lineup and content are
never the same as the show moves across the country on different
Fox Sports Net affiliates. What draws viewers is mainly the fact
that local games precede the sports news, which starts at 10 p.m.
and runs for two hours in all time zones. An updated show with new
anchors comes on every hour.
</P>
<P>
   The 10 p.m. sportscasts on Fox Sports Arizona have better
ratings than ESPN's show, which is on from 11 p.m. to midnight. One
reason is the time. At 10 p.m., it's news time in Arizona, and many
sports fans would rather watch Fox Sports Net than a local newscast
and get an hour or more of sports.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we're compared to ESPN, that's flattery,'' anchor Kevin
Frazier said. ``We've just been at this a year and a half, and ESPN
has done 20,000 shows.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes we forget how big the world is out there. I think
Fox has made the commitment to make this a viable sports product.''
</P>
<P>
   Everyone from Arthur Smith, the executive vice president of
programming and production for Fox Sports Net, to the two young
employees in the ``integration room,'' where the sports news is
integrated into local programming, is surprised with how the
network has taken off. Terenzio has been in on the ground floor of
other ventures, and he knows the feeling of early success.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a lot more fun and creative in start-ups,'' he said.
``You never know what's around the corner. But already, everyone
here thinks this show is a winner, but it's inevitable that it
would do well with our game lead-ins.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not geniuses. We know who the audience probably is, men
18-34 who love sports, and they want to know about sports. When you
think in those terms, you know what to do. A lot of things we
stumble into, and I go into it knowing this is not a sports
programming division. It's a news division about sports.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a fun job that everyone takes seriously, from those hallway
meetings to closed-door sessions in Terenzio's office. At any time
during the day, reporters or analysts are huddled with producers to
go over highlights and edit their scripts. Even during breaks, the
on-air anchors are scratching out paragraphs to bring across
fresher ideas.
</P>
<P>
   With his news background, starting behind the scenes with ABC-TV
in the early 1980s, Terenzio has his own idea how business should
be conducted.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a lot more than scores,'' said Terenzio, whose office is
located in the midst of the Fox Movie Studios lot. ``It's a
tapestry from the topical to the broader issues. We try to capture
the science of sports.''
</P>
<P>
   The Fox Sports Net umbrella covers 22 regional networks,
including Fox Sports Arizona, which serve as the cable home to 69
of the 85 NBA, NHL and major league baseball teams.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the regionals are doing well, but as Smith pointed out,
``All regions are not created equally.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Why didn't anyone do this before?'' Smith wondered. ``The
truth is that it had been talked about, but this was just the right
time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really do like the theory of the home team playing into the
news, and that's a critical mass, so there's always a reason to
tune in.''
</P>
<P>
   The shows look slick, and while fancy machinery and hours of
meetings certainly help, it's often other avenues that lead to the
greatest success.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each hour we have an impromptu meeting, and it's a little like
guerrilla warfare,'' said Terenzio. ``We hold meetings in hallways,
and there's very little formality. One thing that really helps us
is that our anchors can do live TV, and they can do it on the fly.
The liveness of our shows is the most interesting feature.''
</P>
<P>
   The anchors, with the possible exception of Wright, who came to
national prominence when he worked for CNN, have not reached the
level of notoriety as their ESPN counterparts. When Wright came
aboard, it was an instant tonic for his partner, Frazier, who
seemed to loosen up.
</P>
<P>
   Wright's booming voice, which booms even louder in spurts, keeps
everyone on the set on the verge of hysterics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes when I'm sitting next to him, I say to myself, `Who
is this madman on my left?' But during the show, he certainly
entertains us,'' Frazier said.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, entertainment has become the buzzword in televised
sports journalism.
</P>
<P>
   Syndicated radio talk show host Jim Rome has a daily half-hour
show on Fox Sports Net that airs at 6 p.m. in respective time
zones. And in keeping with the network's loosey-goosey attitude,
Rome drives across town after finishing his radio show, and he
sometimes finishes his taping of ``The Last Word'' less than 15
minutes before air time. No backup shows are in the can.
</P>
<P>
   What does all this do to Terenzio?
</P>
<P>
   ``If my ulcer had a meter, I could tell you,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But living on the edge is what got Fox Sports Net to the point
it's at today, and no one wants this roller coaster ride to end. &QL;

COYOTES BOLSTER DEFENSE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB MCMANAMAN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - The Coyotes added another free-agent defenseman
Wednesday, signing New Jersey Devils' farmhand Bryan Helmer to a
multiyear contract.
</P>
<P>
   Terms of the deal were not disclosed, but sources said Helmer
agreed to a two-year deal that will pay him $350,000 in 1999-2000
on a one-way, NHL contract. Helmer will play on a two-way contract
next season, meaning his salary stands to be considerably less if
he plays in the minor leagues.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to signing Helmer, the Coyotes announced later in
the day that they re-signed restricted free agent defenseman Sean
Gagnon to a one-year contract after the Dallas Stars surprisingly
had signed the minor-league, penalty-minute king to a $350,000
offer sheet.
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix immediately matched it. And the Coyotes General Manager
Bobby Smith raised the ante by accusing the Stars of improperly
driving up the cost of the unproven enforcer whom the Coyotes
planned to sign anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm bewildered,'' Smith said. ``And I really don't appreciate
other teams trying to dictate our salary structure when they know
they have no chance of signing the player. It's absurd, and I'm not
very happy about it at all.''
</P>
<P>
   The 6-foot-2, 210-pound Gagnon, one of the busiest fighters in
the minors, probably could have been re-signed by Phoenix for less
than $200,000 on a two-way contract. He led the Coyotes' AHL
affiliate in Springfield last season with 330 penalty minutes. The
year before, he led the International Hockey League with 457
minutes in just 57 games for the Fort Wayne Komets.
</P>
<P>
   Helmer, 26, has spent the past five seasons in the American
Hockey League with the Albany River Rats. Last season, he finished
third on the team in scoring and led all Albany defensemen with a
career-high 14 goals, 49 assists and 63 points. He also had 101
penalty minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Listed at 6-foot-1, 200 pounds, Helmer was named a first-team
AHL All-Star. He recorded 189 points and 422 penalty minutes during
his career with the River Rats.
</P>
<P>
   Helmer, a native of Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario, has never
appeared in an NHL game but likely will battle prospects Jason Doig
and Deron Quint for a roster spot when the Coyotes open training
camp in early September.
</P>
<P>
   ``Absolutely, he'll push for a spot with us,'' Coyotes assistant
general manager Taylor Burke said. ``He's been buried in a very
deep organization, defensively. But we're trying to bring in guys
who can compete for the last couple spots on the NHL roster, and we
think this guy definitely can. We're pretty solid with our top five
(defensemen), but beyond that, we're going to have some
competition, and this guy will be right in that mix.''
</P>
<P>
   In other developments, Smith has talked with the agent for
goalie Bob Essensa regarding a possible backup job to Nikolai
Khabibulin. Essensa, 33, has spent the past two seasons with the
Edmonton Oilers after playing his first six NHL seasons with the
Winnipeg Jets. He is an unrestricted free agent. &QL;

 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Eddie Pope's message was short and direct: Be proud to
be an American soccer player.
</P>
<P>
   Pope was the keynote speaker at the Snickers US Youth Soccer
National Championship players' luncheon Wednesday. He is one of the
first graduates of the US Youth Soccer Association to make the big
time. The 1997 Player of the Year competed in World Cup '98, has
helped D.C. United to back-to-back Major League Soccer titles and
played in the '96 Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   As one of the top young defenders in the world, Pope could
follow some of his fellow American stars and take his game abroad.
But the North Carolina native prefers to be a part of the growth of
soccer in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``These players represent the best in American soccer,'' Pope
said after the luncheon. ``All they have to do is believe in
themselves and believe in American soccer. If we're ever to gain
respect in the world, it has to start right here in the United
States and with each individual.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the message I wanted to get across to these players,
because that's the message I would have wanted someone to tell me
when I was in their position.''
</P>
<P>
   While Pope, 24, is looking toward the future, he said the memory
of the national team's poor showing in World Cup '98 last month
will not soon go away.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a lot of dissension that hurt the morale of the
team,'' Pope said, referring to the disputes between some players
and Coach Steve Sampson. ``It was disappointing for players and
coaches to do that.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was also disappointing that we didn't play to our
potential. I remember watching the U.S. team in the '94 World Cup
and being so proud of what they accomplished. We all worked so hard
to try to be a part of that but just didn't get it done.'' &QL; 
Arizona's finest &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Cisco Flames, Arizona's representative in the nationals,
will take on the Dallas Texans Red in the U-19 boys semifinals at
7:30 tonight.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it comes to the final four, motivation is so important,''
said Petar Draksin, head trainer for the Cisco Soccer Club.
``Playing at home in front of friends and family means so much to
these kids, and I hope that gives us an edge. It's very special to
play at home for a national championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``I talked to (Coach) Willie Watson (Tuesday night) and he said
the kids have their game faces on, they're ready, having fun and
are just very upbeat.'' &QL; 
Staying home &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The San Bernardino Blast, which won the Far West Regionals U-17
boys title in Albuquerque last month, has been disqualified from
the national championships.
</P>
<P>
   A San Bernardino player was given a red card during the final of
the CalSouth State Cup, making him ineligible for the first match
of the regionals. Because of a paperwork snafu, the player competed
in each game of the regionals, and the mix-up wasn't detected until
last week.
</P>
<P>
   The San Juan Arsenal of CalNorth, which lost to San Bernardino,
2-1, in the regional title game, will replace the Blast in the
nationals. &QL;

   PHOENIX - Although the Central Valley Mercury breezed through
the Far West Regionals in Albuquerque last month, outscoring their
opponents, 41-1, the San Jose-based team didn't achieve all its
goals.
</P>
<P>
   The Mercury didn't score off a corner kick in its 8-1 victory
over Colorado Littleton United in the U-18 girls regional
championship match.
</P>
<P>
   Well, you can't win 'em all.
</P>
<P>
   The Mercury's dominance in girls soccer is such that at times,
Coach Vicki Wagner must find ways to challenge her players, give
them incentive beyond merely winning matches.
</P>
<P>
   After all, when you've won two straight national championships,
when you're 85-0-1 the past two years and when you haven't lost
since the start of the 1995-96 season, staying motivated can be
difficult.
</P>
<P>
   ``We set specific goals each game, like scoring off a header,''
Wagner said. ``We try to give the girls a challenge like that.''
</P>
<P>
   There is no need to set such goals for this week's Snickers US
Youth Soccer National Championships at the Rose Mofford Sports
Complex in Phoenix. Winning an unprecedented third consecutive
national title is challenging enough.
</P>
<P>
   On top of that, the Mercury will have to compete without star
player Alyson Wagner. The coach's daughter suffered a torn anterior
cruciate ligament in her left knee on July 6 during a workout with
the U-20 U.S. national team in Portland. The injury will force
Alyson to redshirt next season at Santa Clara University.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was pretty much devastated,'' Vickie Wagner said.
</P>
<P>
   It was Alyson's second ACL injury; she injured her right knee in
1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's our quarterback, so we'll have to make some
adjustments,'' Wagner said. ``The team has played without her
before (in the 1996 regionals) and I have every confidence that
they'll be up to the task this time.''
</P>
<P>
   Alyson, the Gatorade National Player of the Year and ``Parade''
Co-Player of the Year, will be missed, but this is a team loaded
with talent. Anna Kraus and Danielle Slaton also are on the U-20
national team and were joined by Krista Boling on the ``Parade''
All-America team. Thirteen of the 17 players will compete for
Division I colleges in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're really fortunate,'' Wagner said. ``Most of time at this
age when players have college commitments, they don't come to
practices. We don't have that problem. We have a tremendous
commitment from the girls.''
</P>
<P>
   The foundation of the team was laid nearly 10 years ago. Alyson
Wagner, Krista Boling and her twin, Breana, and Anne Griffith
started playing together at age 8. Three more current Mercury
players joined the team at the U-12 level.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then one by one, kids trickled onto the team and we've had
very little turnover,'' Vicki Wagner said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we don't recruit,'' she added, ``because it's illegal
where we come from and we don't have to. We just hope they
recognize we have a good program, and then they will come to you.''
</P>
<P>
   Wagner has had players come to her since she started coaching
her daughter 13 years ago. She knows she has something special in
the Mercury.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the most gratifying thing is to see the response and
reaction from coaches across the country who watch the girls
play,'' Wagner said. ``I had one prominent coach tell me that if
these girls had been recruited as a team by one college, they would
finish in the top 10 in the country as freshmen and win it all as
seniors.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mercury players are looking forward to doing something no
team has ever done.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are excited,'' Wagner said. ``They would really like to
be the first team to win nationals a third time.'' &QL;

RED SOX WILT LATE

<P>
   CLEVELAND _ It's a loser's lament to blame a game on an umpire's
call. More so a one-run game in which the losing team has three
baserunners thrown out at the plate and has its best two hitters at
the plate with the bases loaded in the ninth inning and fails to
score.
</P>
<P>
   But it's also an unprecedented event when Nomar Garciaparra is
the one pointing the finger.
</P>
<P>
   In a clubhouse that was seething from the manager's office to
the locker of losing pitcher Rich Garces to the cubicle where
Garciaparra silently dressed, the shortstop expressed the
frustration the Red Sox felt after Wednesday night's 4-3 loss to
the Cleveland Indians.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of sad,'' Garciaparra said, ``when your pitchers
come in and do their job and you've got to lose on a bad call.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of sad when your catcher isn't even worried about
the guy running because he's running into the dugout on the third
strike.''
</P>
<P>
   Garciaparra was referring to the seventh inning, when plate
umpire Larry McCoy looked at a 1-and-2 fastball that Garces threw
to Indians strongman Jim Thome and called it a ball. A couple of
pitches later, Garces threw a lollipop changeup that Thome hit into
the center-field seats for a two-run homer that wiped out a 3-2 Sox
lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a strikeout _ you can see it on the video,'' said El
Guapo, who had not surrendered a homer to a lefthanded hitter all
season but probably wouldn't have been in the game if Jim Corsi
hadn't slipped in the shower and sprained his right wrist, an
injury that put him on the disabled list.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pitch was right there. It wasn't even middle in. It was
right there. What can you do? There's no consistency. Sometimes
it's a strike, sometimes it isn't. I don't understand it. It's out
of my hands.''
</P>
<P>
   Thome's home run brought a crashing end to a 2-4 trip in which
the Sox lost two of three to both the Tigers and Indians, with a
four-game showdown against the Toronto Blue Jays in Fenway Park on
deck.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox had a chance to tie in the ninth when Mike Benjamin
opened with a bloop single and dashed to third on Midre Cummings's
single to center. But Benjamin was cut down at the plate on a
tapper to the mound, just as Cummings had been thrown out at the
plate on another chopper to the pitcher in the fifth.
</P>
<P>
   After reliever Mike Jackson walked Darren Bragg to load the
bases, he retired Garciaparra on a soft liner to Thome that came
within inches of clearing the leap of the 6-foot-4-inch first
baseman, about the same distance by which Garciaparra's
third-inning triple missed being a homer.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson then ended the game by striking out Mo Vaughn, whom he
induced to chase a full-count fastball out of the strike zone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought we were going to get the game tied,'' said Cummings,
who had swung at a pitchout and reached on catcher's interference
in the fifth, when the Sox scored twice, then singled home their
third run in the sixth.
</P>
<P>
   ``You couldn't ask for a better situation than Nomar and Mo
coming up. But you live with your guns and die with your guns.
That's just the way it is.''
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn said he wasn't going to die with his gun unholstered.
</P>
<P>
   ``He got me,'' Vaughn said. ``You know I'm going to be
aggressive in that situation. He threw a ball at the top of the
zone. It was ball four. But I'm not going to strike out looking. I
can't look for the perfect pitch. He isn't going to let me beat him
in that situation.''
</P>
<P>
   The loss spoiled what had been a superb emergency start by John
Wasdin, who has been demoted twice this spring but allowed just a
run in 5 1/3 innings upon his recall, which may be a brief one.
</P>
<P>
   The early line on this game was that it would qualify as a
future episode of ``Home Run Derby.'' Former University of
Connecticut star Charles Nagy had given up more home runs than any
other pitcher in baseball (27), while Wasdin's homer-to-innings
ratio (1 for every 5.5 innings) was just a hair better than Nagy's
(1 per 4.7).
</P>
<P>
   When Brian Giles took Wasdin deep to give the Indians a 1-0 lead
in the second inning with his 13th home run, it appeared form would
hold.
</P>
<P>
   But that was the only hint of long ball in the early going,
although Garciaparra just missed leaving the building when his
third-inning triple hit inches below the yellow line at the top of
the left-field fence. All was quiet on the homer front until Thome
connected, capping an inning that began with Cleveland trailing,
3-1. But Pat Borders doubled and eventually scored on an Omar
Vizquel sacrifice fly, and David Justice, the last batter faced by
Derek Lowe, singled with two out, setting the stage for
Garces-Thome.
</P>
<P>
   Wasdin, whose last demotion came July 4 to make room for
Thursday night's starter, Korean Jin Ho Cho, shrugged when asked if
he expected to be around long.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who knows?'' he said. ``I don't know. Only time will tell.
I'll just try to make every day count. Whatever happens.''

SPARKS NEARING ANOTHER SHAKE-UP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)

 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Yes, the Mercury is 1-5 against other likely WNBA
playoff teams. Starting shooting guard Bridget Pettis averaged only
8.8 points in the just-completed homestand. And starting power
forward Toni Foster has been on the injured list for almost a month
because of a stress fracture in her right leg.
</P>
<P>
   But Phoenix's problems are minuscule compared with those of the
Los Angeles Sparks, stumbling toward an organizational shake-up
even larger than the one that claimed Coach Linda Sharp 11 games
into last season.
</P>
<P>
   The Sparks were 4-7 then, en route to a 5-10 start before
scrambling to .500 (14-14) and almost catching the Mercury for the
Western Conference title. Going into tonight's game against the
Mercury (12-5) at the Great Western Forum, LA is 5-11, putting the
future of not only Coach Julie Rousseau but General Manager Rhonda
Windham in jeopardy.
</P>
<P>
   Mercury Coach Cheryl Miller said last year that her former
Southern California teammate, Windham, not her former USC coach,
Sharp, was to blame for personnel decisions that handicapped Sharp.
</P>
<P>
   Windham also promoted Rousseau, whose previous coaching
experience was at the high school level, from assistant to interim
head coach before deciding to retain her for this season.
</P>
<P>
   The Sparks still are only three games behind Cleveland (9-8) in
the loss column for the fourth and final playoff berth, but they
also must haul down New York (10-9) and Detroit (10-9) to achieve
that.
</P>
<P>
   With small forward Allison Feaster (fractured foot) and backup
center Haixia Zheng (knee surgery) on the injured list, the odds
that the Sparks will go on a major roll in their final 14 games are
slim.
</P>
<P>
   Barring that, Windham and Rousseau could be fired at season's
end so the Sparks can call on the elite women's college coaches to
turn their fortunes.
</P>
<P>
   Of more immediate concern is starting center Lisa Leslie, who
missed practice Wednesday to be evaluated for wrist, groin and knee
injuries. She is probable for tonight.
</P>
<P>
   The 6-foot-5 Leslie has a league-high 10 double-doubles in what
sometimes seems like a single-handed effort to keep Los Angeles
afloat. She almost compiled another (24 points, 9 rebounds) Tuesday
in a 92-77 loss to New York.
</P>
<P>
   Leslie leads the WNBA in rebounding (10.2 average) and is tied
for second in scoring (19.1) with the Mercury's Jennifer Gillom,
who is fifth on the boards (7.2) and has four double-doubles.
</P>
<P>
   The Mercury, playing on the road for the first time in 15 days,
is excited about the change of scenery.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're looking forward to getting on the road,'' point guard
Michele Timms said. ``We had six games at home, and we had a lot of
things that needed to be worked through. I think we're ready to
take the next step and beat teams on the road.''
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix plays four straight and nine of its final 13 away from
America West Arena, including a July 31 encounter against the
Sparks and two games (Tuesday and Aug. 6) against league champion
Houston. &QL;

NETWORK BEGINNING AUSPICIOUS

<P>
   PHOENIX - Combine great timing and good luck, and things start
to happen.
</P>
<P>
   That's the situation in which Fox Sports Arizona found itself
Sept. 7, 1996, the first day on air. Arizona State's 45-42 victory
over Washington marked the start of the Sun Devils' bid for a
national championship, and it allowed FOXAZ to hit the ground
running. Later that month, the network also showed ASU's 19-0 win
over Nebraska.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the things that has been so incredible is that we have
been witness to some of Arizona's greatest athletic endeavors,''
said Todd Merkow, vice president and general manager.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had ASU football's national championship run, the first
year of the NHL in Phoenix, UA and its national (basketball)
championship, and now we're there for the first year of baseball.
And we also showed high school football and basketball
championships for the first time.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox Sports Arizona turned two years old this month with 1
million households in the fold. Not a bad number, but Merkow
expected to be farther down the road.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have high expectations for everything we do and I do,''
Merkow said. ``I thought where we are at today would have come
sooner. But we're still in the process of introducing ourselves to
the marketplace, and that doesn't happen overnight. Looking at it
from that standpoint to where we've come in two years, I'm very
pleased.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been some confusion in the marketplace on Fox Sports
Arizona, Fox-TV (KSAZ, Channel 10) and Cox. It's an ongoing
process.''
</P>
<P>
   Merkow said Fox Sports Arizona is trying to reach consumers in a
number of ways, and he said he won't stick to conventional cable or
TV marketing to achieve that goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm excited about next year,'' Merkow said. ``If we can reach
some of things we hope to put in place, we'll gain another level of
exposure with fans in the market.''
</P>
<P>
   The goal is to become engrained in viewers' minds as the
hometown sports provider.
</P>
<P>
   Major achievements for the statewide network are 10-year
agreements with the Coyotes and Diamondbacks. &QL;

BOWS AND GIRLS, IT'S A HAPPENING

FLAGSTAFF, Ariz. - This was competitive archery, but all that could
be heard was talking and laughing. The five women strode through
the forest with their bows, conversing and giggling like old
friends, stopping occasionally to unleash an arrow at a target with
their compound bows.
</P>
<P>
   It was about 10 a.m. Friday morning, the first day of the
three-day Bowhunter Happening at the Coconino Fairgrounds south of
here.
</P>
<P>
   The event has taken place for about 15 years. Sponsored by the
Arizona Bowhunters Association, it began with a few and has
increased to multitudes. The organization now contends that it is
the largest family-oriented archery event in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   It draws about 2,000 shooters, and once families are included,
an estimated 12,000 to 15,000 people experience the Happening.
</P>
<P>
   The amazing thing is that only about 300 of the registered
shooters come for competition. The rest take part in
non-competitive target practice.
</P>
<P>
   All the targets are three-dimensional, meaning they are
foam-made, full-bodied animals _ everything from bears to turkeys
to deer. The various 20-target ranges are laid out in stations back
in the forest.
</P>
<P>
   Adult archers stand near one marker to shoot at the target.
Young archers have a closer marker. Shooters might be looking down
at a target through a clump of trees or up through the rocks at
another.
</P>
<P>
   Each station has its own challenges. The five women are
competitive archers. They're out to win but insist on having fun
doing it.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Cerreta of Glendale has made most every Bowhunter Happening
but has yet to shoot. That's because he spends his time helping
supervise the archers. Those involved in staging the event take
great pride in making it extremely successful.
</P>
<P>
   Among the competitive archers, he said, women and children have
the most fun.
</P>
<P>
   ``The women, especially, will laugh when they miss,'' Cerreta
said. ``The men cringe. They're much more intense. That's why you
see more women and kids than men.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the five women is Hope Hewitt of Prescott Valley. This is
her second year of competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``My husband is an archer, and my daughter has been shooting for
about 10 years,'' she said. ``I decided it was time for me to get
involved. Archery is a family thing.''
</P>
<P>
   The women joke as they make the rounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``It must have been a man who set up these kills,'' said one,
referring to the difficulty of some targets.
</P>
<P>
   Another hit low on a standing bear target and worried if she had
``ruined its manhood.''
</P>
<P>
   Rosemary Harris of Flagstaff said she'd been shooting for about
18 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I started going out with friends that shoot,'' she said. ``I
would walk around with them and keep score. But, naturally, I got
the fever and started shooting with them.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked whether she hunted, too, Tish Harper of Tucson said
she did, ``but all we eat is foam game,'' referring to the targets.
</P>
<P>
   For both men and women, the sophisticated compound bows were
predominant because of their sights, long distance and great
accuracy.
</P>
<P>
   But John Gordon of Kingman was competing in a class with a
traditional bow. He had trouble hitting the longer targets.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't care,'' he said. ``A traditional bow is more fun.
Besides that, you can build your own. I built this one.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides the courses for competitors and practice shooters, the
Happening also offers a free course for the little ones.
</P>
<P>
   More than 300 wee shooters usually go through that course,
according to Paul Line and Bill Loughrey, both of Mesa, who run it
each year.
</P>
<P>
   The course offers free T-shirts to the kids and loaner bows and
arrows to participants who don't have their own.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are the same targets the big guys have,'' Loughrey said
of the foam animals. ``Some people who don't shoot just come out
here to have a picnic and let their kids shoot on the range.''
</P>
<P>
   They are particularly proud of a shoot for handicapped children
on Saturday morning.
</P>
<P>
   But this is much more than a shoot. It is an event. Three
buildings house vendor booths. Another archery company has a
tractor trailer than converts into an archery store.
</P>
<P>
   Food vendors feed the hungry crowds. There are varmint, elk and
turkey calling contests.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the world aerial championships, where competitors
from large to small use short-distance arrows to shoot at
Frisbee-like targets in the air. It's like a trap shoot, only with
bows.
</P>
<P>
   And wherever you look, there are families _ some carrying bows,
some just looking around.
</P>
<P>
   For some participants, it's a chance to hone their hunting
skills. For others, it's just a chance to shoot at targets or just
be with their families. For all, it's one of the biggest,
most-enjoyable outdoor events in the state. &QL;

DODGERS BEAT ASTROS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MARC J. SPEARS  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The Dodgers traded for Brian Bohanon because he
showed flashes of brilliance as a starter.
</P>
<P>
   And on Wednesday night, they finally saw those flashes work to
their benefit as the left-hander earned his first win with the club
_ a 6-4 victory over the Houston Astros in front of 31,365 at
Dodger Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers, who also had three home runs in the victory,
increased their winning streak to three games. The Dodgers, who
stayed 4{ games behind the Chicago Cubs in the wild card race, have
a chance tonight to earn a four-game win streak for the first time
this season.
</P>
<P>
   After going 0-2 with a 4.66 ERA during his first two starts with
the Dodgers, Bohanon (3-6) stymied the Astros by allowing just one
run on two hits in six innings.
</P>
<P>
   Bohanon was acquired in a trade with the New York Mets on July
10 for right-hander Greg McMichael. Although he spent most of his
career as a reliever, the Dodgers' new fifth starter showed promise
as a starter and was 1-1 with a 3.00 ERA in that role with the Mets
this season.
</P>
<P>
   Despite losing the game, Bohanon opened some eyes by allowing
just one earned run _ a Mark McGwire home run _ on two hits in 52/3
innings during his previous start at St. Louis on July 17. And
after a tough first inning, Bohanon went on to dominate the Astros
and surely make interim general manager Tommy Lasorda proud about
making the trade.
</P>
<P>
   Bohanon's start was rough, as Bill Spiers _ who walked _ scored
on a one-out double by Derek Bell that gave the Astros a 1-0 lead
in the first inning.
</P>
<P>
   Also in the first, usual Dodger reserve Wilton Guerrero showed
some hustle by earning an infield single off Houston start Jose
Lima (8-6). And in the third, he showed the same grit by getting a
leadoff double after hitting a ball to the gap in left-center and
advancing to third after Bell bobbled the ball. Guerrero then tied
the game at 1-1 after Juan Castro's sacrifice fly.
</P>
<P>
   Taking a page from Guerrero, Raul Mondesi used the same
enthusiasm after he followed Castro with a single. Mondesi went on
to steal second and then raced to third after Brad Ausmus' bad and
low throw ended up in center field. With two outs, Eric Karros gave
the Dodgers a 2-1 lead when he brought in Mondesi with an RBI
single.
</P>
<P>
   After using so much energy to score runs, the Dodgers made it a
little simpler with the long ball.
</P>
<P>
   In the fourth inning, Charles Johnson hit a ball by the shallow
left-field foul line and watched Houston third baseman Spiers and
shortstop Ricky Gutierrez run into each other as the ball drop
fair. After the ball dropped, Johnson was booed by the fans since
he barely made it safe at first in time.
</P>
<P>
   Those jeers, however, turned to cheers when Johnson hit his 14th
home run of the season off Lima with one out to give the Dodgers a
3-1 advantage.
</P>
<P>
   In the fifth, the Dodgers battered Lima with the long ball again
with back-to-back home runs from Gary Sheffield and Karros that
pushed their club ahead 5-1. Sheffield's 18th home run came on a
two-out 0-1 pitch from Lima that landed in the right field
bleachers. And Karros followed on the next pitch with home run
No.11 that landed in the left field bleachers.
</P>
<P>
   The back-to-back home runs marked just the second time that the
Dodgers accomplished that feat this season. The only other
occurrence came during the Dodgers' home opener on April 7, when
Todd Hollandsworth and Thomas Howard hit back-to-back home runs
against Arizona in the fifth inning. Hollandsworth is out for the
season with a left shoulder cartilage tear, and Howard was
designated for assignment on June 27.
</P>
<P>
   After being up 5-2 in the seventh, the Dodgers went back up by
four when Karros hit a two-out RBI double to left-center that
scored a racing Mondesi from first base. Karros, who entered the
game batting .342 with three home runs with runners in scoring
position, batted 3 for 4 with a home run and three RBI.
</P>
<P>
   In the ninth, Dodgers closer Jeff Shaw ended a scoreless streak
by allowing a solo home run to Everett that cut Houston's deficit
to 6-4. Shaw, however, recovered to earn his 28th save by striking
out the next three Astros.

RANDY JOHNSON OFF THE MARK AS TAMPA BEATS MARINERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By BUD WITHERS  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. _ If, by chance, this was the last pitching
appearance by Randy Johnson in a Mariner uniform, it will be
remembered a lot like his final season for Seattle _ enigmatic,
edgy and ultimately unsuccessful.
</P>
<P>
   In a game that called to mind too many other Mariner games this
year, the M's lost to expansion Tampa Bay here Wednesday night,
7-5, despite having their best pitcher on the mound and having
disposed of the Devil Rays' All-Star right-hander, Rolando Arrojo.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, continually the subject of trade rumors even as the
club says it won't happen, wasn't especially lucky in the four-run
seventh inning that beat him. But then, he wasn't especially heady,
either.His eighth error of the season made all four runs unearned
and tagged the M's with a giveaway loss.
</P>
<P>
   ``Could it be concentration?'' Mariner manager Lou Piniella
asked pregnantly, in reference to Johnson's unusually high error
total.
</P>
<P>
   To the suggestion that this was the first time in a while the
M's had reverted to their altruistic, throw-it-away days, Piniella
paused long and said, ``Yeah. It might not be the last.''
</P>
<P>
   The loss didn't cost the M's anything in the standings, with
Texas' loss to Kansas City leaving Seattle 9{ back in the American
League West. But the onus is on the pursuers, and now the Mariners
begin a demanding 11-game stretch against red-hot Baltimore and two
division leaders, Cleveland and New York, one that could
conceivably destroy their fragile playoff candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gets draining,'' sighed John Marzano, the catcher,
referring to five unearned runs, ``because we've seen it all
year.''
</P>
<P>
   This was going to be an enticing pitching matchup, Johnson
having thrown two straight shutouts and Arroyo, with 11 victories
and a 2.87 earned-run average, one of the best young prospects in
the game.
</P>
<P>
   Neither guy had his ``A'' material.
</P>
<P>
   ``His location was off tonight,'' said Marzano, talking for
Johnson, who hasn't spoken publicly for weeks. ``He missed a lot of
spots tonight. If you see the replay on TV, if I set up inside,
he'd throw the ball outside _ and did for a couple of innings
straight. He hasn't been like that the previous five starts.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Johnson on an off-night is sometimes good enough. And
when the M's tore into Arrojo for a pair of two-out, two-run homers
by Marzano and Alex Rodriguez in the sixth inning, it gave Seattle
a 5-3 lead that looked promising.
</P>
<P>
   But then luck, location and wits all deserted Johnson in the
seventh. On an 0-2 pitch to Quentin McCracken leading off, Johnson
got the ball up and McCracken doubled to right. Then Mike Kelly
sent a checked-swing bouncer back to Johnson, who spotted McCracken
roaming dangerously far off second.
</P>
<P>
   Before the game, pitching coach Stan Williams talked about how
young pitchers will try to save one run and in the process give up
three. In this case, it was a 10-year veteran doing that and giving
up four.
</P>
<P>
   ``You go to first with the ball, and get the out,'' said
Piniella. ``We work our way out of that inning.''
</P>
<P>
   A good throw from Johnson to shortstop Alex Rodriguez probably
gets McCracken. But with Rodriguez on the move toward second for
the throw, Johnson heaved it high to the shortstop side for an
error that opened the gates.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he had enough to punch out John Flaherty and Paul
Sorrento with crackling fastballs, and he was on the verge of a
third straight against leadoff hitter Randy Winn.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson came inside on Winn, and second baseman Joey Cora, who
had already made another inscrutable throwing error, took a step
toward second, perhaps anticipating that the ball would be hit to
his right. Instead, Winn fought it off, chopped it to right and the
run-scoring hit made it 5-4.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't see Cora anywhere near it,'' said Winn. ``He probably
thought I'd pull it or hit it up the middle.''
</P>
<P>
   Sustained, the Rays struck for two more hits and three more
runs. Miguel Cairo tied the game with a bouncer that Rico Rossy
couldn't glove at third, and Bobby Smith hit the game-winner, a
two-run single through the shortstop hole.
</P>
<P>
   It was all a little galling for the M's, who had trailed Arrojo
_ author of nothing but seven-inning performances or longer since
late in May _ 3-1 in the sixth before Marzano and Rodriguez
connected. It was Marzano's first homer of the year, eighth of his
career and only the second of this decade.
</P>
<P>
   In the locker room, he would find it a mixed blessing, enduring
inferences from his buddy Ken Griffey Jr. that his bat was corked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey,'' Griffey continued, referring to a Griffey-Marzano home
run entry, ``we got 41 now.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the only light moment in the clubhouse. The M's now go on
to Baltimore for three games starting Friday night in search of
some more.

ERICKSON WILLING TO LISTEN, TRY `FRESH IDEAS' WITH SEAHAWKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LAURA VECSEY  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHENEY, Wash. _ The Seahawks no longer wait until the end of
practice to drill the special teams. Someone learned a lesson last
year. Dennis Erickson understands he must expand his horizons and
bring in ``fresh ideas.'' Otherwise his job as coach of the
Seahawks will come to a dead end.
</P>
<P>
   ``You wait until the end of practice to work on special teams,
it's almost like it's punishment,'' Erickson said Wednesday about
the new approach to one of the Seahawks' most glaring flaws last
season.
</P>
<P>
   As Erickson leads the Hawks through his fourth camp, he has
taken the advice of his new assistant head coach, Pete Rodriguez.
Special teams matter. Changes were necessary. Erickson had to open
his mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rodriguez has his approach to the special teams at practice,
which is to work in the middle, with the whole team there, which I
haven't been around before. So that will help,'' Erickson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question about it, you learn every year. I think
the guys who have been in the league 20 years learn something new
all the time. Fresh ideas come in. Sometimes when you have a
coaching change, you don't like to have them because you like
continuity, but you bring new guys in. And all of a sudden there's
fresh ideas.''
</P>
<P>
   More than anything, Erickson has prized loyalty in his coaching
ranks. Perhaps it was a product of his college breeding. During his
stint at the University of Miami, Erickson had to learn to watch
his back. One never knows which of his guys would turn around and
do anything to become The Guy.
</P>
<P>
   But more than anything, loyalty might have crushed Erickson's
chances to be a successful NFL coach last season. Granted, Erickson
is right to assert that it takes five years to rebuild a football
team, which is why he might have preferred an expansion franchise
for a better chance at instant success.
</P>
<P>
   And injuries were a big part of the problem last year, but even
that litany (only seven players started all 16 games) could not
cover up the glaring weaknesses and weak links in a coaching staff
that could not give the upgraded Seahawk talent the tools to win.
</P>
<P>
   Injuries did not cost the Seahawks a shellacking in the opener
to the Jets. Nor were they the reason the special teams cost the
Seahawks four wins.
</P>
<P>
   There were gaps in the defensive and offensive schemes the
coaching staff provided. Linebacker Chad Brown could not get a
scheme that would help him blitz, his trademark. Speedster Joey
Galloway, promised again and again that he would get the ball more
often, was hardly exploited.
</P>
<P>
   It was critical for Erickson and the Seahawks to remedy these
problems, immediately, or risk knowing that all the big-money
talent that the Hawks have signed could go unused.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the amount of injuries we had last year, it basically
derailed our season, so it was tough,'' Brown said about Erickson's
growth as a head coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``But as a college coach, you've got 100 guys on your team. You
play maybe 11 or 12 games. We (in the pro game) have 45 guys and if
you go to the Super Bowl, you play 25 games. So you have to
approach things differently from a training camp perspective to
practice perspective. He's learned to ask guys like (free agent
veteran) Brian Habib: `What did you guys do in Denver? How were you
guys successful?' So (Erickson's) learning and we appreciate it.''
</P>
<P>
   As Seahawks president Bob Whitsitt searched for a big-name
general manager in the offseason, the contracts of many of the
assistant coaches were allowed to expire. As some of those
assistants decided to take jobs elsewhere, Erickson was forced to
interview new assistants, with an emphasis placed on coaches with a
ton of NFL experience.
</P>
<P>
   Along with Rodriguez, an 11-year veteran with successful stints
in Oakland, Washington and Phoenix, Erickson's other major hire was
linebackers coach Jim Johnson, a 13-year veteran who was the
defensive coordinator with the Colts.
</P>
<P>
   The players were eager for help.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year, I don't think we had anyone on staff who was really
familiar with all the zone blitz stuff,'' said Brown, the former
AFC linebacker of the year who wants to get back to quarterback
attacks, which is how he made his dominating mark with the
Steelers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year was very frustrating from the respect that I had one
or two blitzes, but after the third or fourth week of the season,
everyone was pretty much picking them up. This year, we'll probably
have some answers.''
</P>
<P>
   There is still a sense in camp that the talent on the team might
be ahead of the coaching staff's ability and vision to provide
meaningful preparation, winning schemes and adjustments. But better
pieces might now be in place, especially in the critical areas of
defense and special teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to win. I want to go to the playoffs. That's why I came
here. I signed a five-year contract. We need to get it done. We
need to get to the playoffs. That's where the pressure comes from.
And there's more because we're better,'' Erickson said.
</P>
<P>
   The pieces are in place. All Erickson must do to deflate the
pressure is make sure they fit together and work.

UPDATES WITH QUOTES, DETAILS

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The Dodgers traded for Brian Bohanon because he
showed flashes of brilliance as a starter.
</P>
<P>
   And on Wednesday night, those flashes finally worked to their
benefit as the left-hander earned his first win with the Dodgers _
a 6-4 decision over the Houston Astros in front of 31,365 at Dodger
Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers, who had three home runs, won their third straight
for the first time since sweeping three at Texas from May 30-June
2. The Dodgers, who stayed 4{ games behind the Chicago Cubs in the
wild-card race, have a chance tonight to earn a four-game win
streak for the first time this season.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers (52-49), who haven't been three games over .500
since since May 3, and the Detroit Tigers are the only major-league
clubs that haven't won four straight this season.
</P>
<P>
   After going 0-2 with a 4.66 ERA during his first two starts with
the Dodgers, Bohanon (3-6) stymied the Astros by allowing just one
run on two hits in six innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just making good pitches to get out of innings, and I
ended up with the win,'' said Bohanon, who snapped a career-high
losing streak at three games.
</P>
<P>
   Bohanon was acquired in a trade with the New York Mets on July
10 for right-hander Greg McMichael. Although he spent most of his
career as a reliever, the Dodgers' new fifth starter was 1-1 with a
3.00 ERA in that role with the Mets this season.
</P>
<P>
   Bohanon opened some eyes by allowing just one earned run _ a
511-foot Mark McGwire home run _ on two hits in 52/3 innings during
a loss in his previous start at St. Louis on Friday. He got in
trouble early this game, as Bill Spiers scored from first on a
one-out double by Derek Bell that gave the Astros a 1-0 lead in the
first inning. But that would be all the damage that Bohanon would
endure.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Bohanon) pitched well tonight,'' said Dodgers manager Glenn
Hoffman. ``He is a strong competitor, and that is what I like to
see.''
</P>
<P>
   Bohanon said, ``I felt like I threw the ball well the last time
out, and I did again tonight. Hopefully, it will continue for a few
games.''
</P>
<P>
   In the third inning, Wilton Guerrero, usually a reserve, hustled
to third base after his leadoff double was bobbled by Bell. He
scored on Juan Castro's sacrifice fly, tying the score at 1.
</P>
<P>
   Raul Mondesi followed Castro with a single. He stole second and
raced to third when catcher Brad Ausmus' low throw ended up in
center field. With two outs, Eric Karros gave the Dodgers a 2-1
lead with an RBI single that scored Mondesi.
</P>
<P>
   After using so much energy to score runs, the Dodgers made it a
little simpler with the long ball.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Johnson hit his 14th home run of the season off Jose
Lima in the fourth to give the Dodgers a 3-1 advantage.
</P>
<P>
   In the fifth, the Dodgers battered Lima again with back-to-back,
two-out home runs from Gary Sheffield and Karros for a 5-1 lead.
Sheffield's 18th home run came on a 0-1 pitch from Lima that landed
in the right-field bleachers. Karros followed on the next pitch
with his 11th home run.
</P>
<P>
   The only other time the Dodgers hit back-to-back home runs this
season was April 7, when Todd Hollandsworth and Thomas Howard did
it against Arizona in the fifth inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``I sucked tonight,'' said the loser Lima (8-6), who is 0-3
against the Dodgers this season. ``I left the ball up and got
hurt.''
</P>
<P>
   Karros, who hit an RBI double in seventh to put the Dodgers up
6-2, went 3 for 4 with a home run and three RBI.
</P>
<P>
   On his first pitch in the ninth, Dodgers closer Jeff Shaw ended
a scoreless streak of 14 innings by allowing a Carl Everett solo
home run that cut Houston's deficit to 6-4. But he recovered to
earn his 28th save by striking out the next three Astros.
</P>
<P>
   ``This club is playing pretty well,'' said Shaw. ``Hopefully, we
can keep it going.''

MCGWIRE KEPT QUIET, BUT GIANTS FALL AGAIN 
BY HENRY SCHULMAN
</HEADLINE>
   c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Those among the 40,147 who paid good money to
see Mark McGwire hit a tape-measure home run Wednesday night left
3Com Park unhappy. Now, those who showed up to see Gary Gaetti hit
one of his patented opposite-field homers that scrape the back of
the outfield fence had a night of sheer ecstasy.
</P>
<P>
   As for those who came to see the Giants win, well, if they have
paid attention for the past two weeks, their expectations were
probably not high to begin with.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants' second-half tumble reached 2-10 with Wednesday
night's 3-2 loss to the St. Louis Cardinals. Mark McGwire (0-for-4,
including a double-play grounder) was not the story. The Giants'
inability to score more than twice against the normally generous
Redbirds' pitching staff was.
</P>
<P>
   The defeat dropped the Giants a dirty dozen games behind the
first-place San Diego Padres in the National League West and 21/2
games behind the wild-card-leading Chicago Cubs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just need to score some more runs,'' an exasperated Giants
manager Dusty Baker said. ``I know everyone is trying exceptionally
hard, maybe too hard. Everybody just has to relax. Everybody wants
to be the one to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Giants' brass was so concerned after last night's defeat
that general manager Brian Sabean called a half-dozen veteran
player into Baker's office for a lengthy meeting long after the
final out.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was good,'' said center fielder Darryl Hamilton. ``They
just asked us what was going on and what we thought the team needed
to do. It shows what kind of organization we're dealing with.''
</P>
<P>
   Baker and Sabean did not leave the clubhouse until close to
midnight, even though they had to return for a 12:35 p.m. game
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants have scored 42 runs in the 12 games since the break,
an average of 3.5 per game, which has not been enough to back an
injury-weakened pitching staff that is not performing as well as
did in the first half.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants actually got a fine start Wednesday night from Kirk
Rueter (10-6), who lasted seven innings for the first time since
May 31. But Gaetti's two-run homer in the second inning and Brian
Jordan's solo shot in the fourth were enough to doom Rueter to his
third straight loss.
</P>
<P>
   The gopher ball is becoming a problem for Rueter. He has thrown
15 in his past 16 starts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought Gaetti hit a pretty good pitch. He went the other
way with it. I tip my hat to him,'' Rueter said. ``Jordan, I made a
mistake. He's a pretty good hitter, and he didn't miss it.''
</P>
<P>
   All of St. Louis' scoring came on the two homers. Gaetti hit his
with one out in the second inning after Rueter walked the leadoff
man, Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants tied the game with a two-out, two-run single by
Hamilton in the bottom of the second, their only run-producing hit
of the night. But Jordan gave St. Louis the lead for good when he
smacked Rueter's first pitch of the fourth inning, a changeup that
Jordan was expecting, over the bleachers in left for his 17th
homer.
</P>
<P>
   ``There aren't many guys who can hit a first-pitch changeup out
of the park,'' said an admiring Cardinals manager Tony La Russa.
</P>
<P>
   Hitters on a lot of teams like to challenge each other on their
home-run numbers, but not on a team led by McGwire's 43.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be an unfair contest. Mac would win hands down,''
Jordan said. ``He is a power hitter. Other guys on the team don't
say they're power hitters. I don't. If I hit a home run, I hit a
home run. I like to go for the gaps.''
</P>
<P>
   A guy with 17 homers in July is not a power hitter?
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't say I was a  &LR; weak  &LR; hitter,'' Jordan said. ``Sometimes
I can power it up and hit it out.''
</P>
<P>
   The Giants would love to power it up, too. They mustered just
three hits after the second inning against Bobby Witt, a Texas
castoff who had a 7.77 ERA when the Rangers dumped him last month,
and two relievers. La Russa was asked if he thought the Giants
looked flat.
</P>
<P>
   His answer: ``I saw a lot of good body life, a lot of good
at-bats. It's a long season. You have ups, you have downs. They
looked like they were going at it like they always do.''
</P>
<P>
   The effort may be there, but the results are not, which is
really all that matters. What will it take for the Giants to escape
the funk they are in?
</P>
<P>
   Who knows?
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes you get into a funk and you don't know why,'' Baker
said. ``If we could come up with a definition of `funk,' we'd know
how to cure it.''

ALAN SHEPARD, FIRST AMERICAN IN SPACE  
 BY MICHAEL TAYLOR 
</HEADLINE>
   c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Alan B. Shepard Jr., one of the original astronauts who had
enough of the ``right stuff'' to become the first American in space
and the only man to play golf on the moon, died Tuesday night in a
hospital in Monterey, Calif. He was 74.
</P>
<P>
   Ohio Sen. John Glenn, an old friend of Shepard's from the days
when they were both Mercury Project astronauts, said Shepard, who
lived in Pebble Beach, died after a long battle with leukemia.
</P>
<P>
   ``I talked to him not too long ago,'' Glenn said in Washington
Wednesday. ``He said he wasn't as strong as he used to be. He said
he was running about half throttle. He died in his sleep _ a good
way to go, I guess. He will truly be missed in a great way. He was
a close friend and a great guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Glenn said Shepard was intensely interested in Glenn's planned
flight this October on the space shuttle, when Glenn will be 77.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wanted to be there if he could, didn't know if he could,''
Glenn said. ``He was interested in some of the things I'd been
training on.''
</P>
<P>
   It was an interest the two men shared for nearly 40 years.
</P>
<P>
   On May 5, 1961 _ just three weeks after the Soviets had sent
cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin into a complete orbit of Earth _ Shepard, a
Navy commander at the time, rode a rocket that shot him and his
``Freedom 7'' Mercury capsule 116 miles straight up from Cape
Canaveral.
</P>
<P>
   Shepard's tiny capsule then hurled him downrange 302 miles and,
forever after, into the history books as an authentic American
hero, idolized by youngsters and envied by anyone who had ever
thought about flying off into space.
</P>
<P>
   ``None of us who were alive then will ever forget him sitting so
calmly in Freedom 7 atop a slender and sometimes unreliable Mercury
Redstone rocket,'' President Clinton said Wednesday. ``Those of us
who are old enough to remember the first space flights will always
remember what an impression he made on us and on the world.''
</P>
<P>
   At NASA headquarters, Shepard's home for some 15 years as both
an astronaut and an executive, administrator Daniel Goldin said
Shepard's journey ``made a whole bunch of us engineers excited
about the space program. His flight was a tremendous statement
about tenacity, courage and brilliance.''
</P>
<P>
   That quarter of an hour in space came at a time when nearly
everything about space travel was exotic news. The journey
catapulted Shepard into a rarefied level of fame _ the flight was
watched live on television by millions of people, and after he
splashed down, he jubilantly radioed the world, ``Everything is
A-OK!'' thereby coining an indelible addition to American slang.
</P>
<P>
   After he was plucked from the Atlantic Ocean, Shepard was
honored with huge parades in New York, Los Angeles and Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Three weeks after Shepard's suborbital flight, President John F.
Kennedy, buoyed by the roaring success of Freedom 7, announced that
the United States ``should commit itself to achieving the goal,
before the decade is out, of landing a man on the moon and
returning him safely to Earth.''
</P>
<P>
   The goal was met in July 1969, when Apollo 11 successfully put
Neil Armstrong on the moon.
</P>
<P>
   Two years later, it was Shepard's turn _ at the age of 47, he
commanded the Apollo 14 mission and, after it landed, hauled out a
makeshift six-iron and whacked a few balls down what passes for a
green on the moon.
</P>
<P>
   The moon landing was the culmination of a career that began on
the eve of World War II, when Shepard was accepted into the U.S.
Naval Academy at Annapolis. He graduated in 1944, and was
immediately commissioned an ensign and dispatched to the Pacific,
where he served out the last few months of the war on the destroyer
Cogswell.
</P>
<P>
   After the war, Shepard desperately wanted to be a Navy pilot.
While training in Texas and Florida, he became so impatient that on
his own time and his own dime he took private flying lessons to
hurry the process along.
</P>
<P>
   In 1950, Shepard joined the Navy's Test Pilot School in Patuxent
River, Md., and soon was testing high-altitude planes and in-flight
refueling systems.
</P>
<P>
   When NASA's call went out in 1959 for volunteers in the manned
space flight program, Shepard leaped at the opportunity. He
competed against 109 other test pilots and in the end was one of
seven hotshots chosen for the Mercury Project, along with Glenn,
Scott Carpenter, Virgil (Gus) Grissom, Walter Schirra Jr., Donald
Slayton and L. Gordon Cooper. (Of those original seven, only Glenn,
Cooper, Carpenter and Schirra are still alive.)
</P>
<P>
   In April 1959, the space agency presented the astronauts to the
world at a big press conference. With Life magazine contracts and
the press constantly hovering, the Mercury 7 became America's most
celebrated heroes. Some 20 years later, they were immortalized in
Tom Wolfe's dead-on appreciation, ``The Right Stuff,'' and, four
years later, in the movie version of the book.
</P>
<P>
   The Right Stuff, as Wolfe defined it, was a combination of
outrageous cockiness, ambition, patriotism, a well-honed aversion
to bureaucracy and, by the way, no small measure of talent. The
original Mercury 7, if Wolfe got it right, had those qualities in
spades.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was the epitome of `the Right Stuff,' however trite that
might sound,'' said Jack King, NASA public information officer for
Shepard's flight. ``He was a first-class guy, at times egotistical,
but first class.''
</P>
<P>
   After the Mercury flight, however, Shepard, eager to join the
Gemini program and, later, the Apollo missions, discovered that he
suffered from Meniere's syndrome, a devastating disease of the
inner ear that causes dizziness and loss of balance. He was taken
off space flight status and made chief of NASA's astronaut office,
where he spent his days watching others prepare for the moon
missions.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Shepard refused to let his illness sidetrack him.
After six years of treatment, he was cured and NASA gave him the
A-OK to return to space flight.
</P>
<P>
   In 1974, three years after his moon mission, Shepard retired
from the Navy, as a rear admiral, and also from NASA. Always known
as a tough and fearless competitor, he became a highly successful
businessman, buying a bank, developing real estate properties and
investing in quarterhorses and oil wells.
</P>
<P>
   Shepard is survived by his wife, Louise; his daughters Julie,
Laura and Alice; and six grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   Funeral services will be private. The family suggests donations
to the Astronaut Scholarship Foundation, 6225 Vectorspace Blvd.,
Titusville, Fla., 32780.

   HARM THAN GOOD Patients who undergo radiation treatment after
surgery for the most common form of lung cancer may do worse than
patients who do not undergo post-operative radiation. A new study

<P>
   &UR; The inside story of the FBI's two-decade entanglement with
James ``Whitey'' Bulger and Stephen ``The Rifleman'' Flemmi can now
be told as a result of extraordinary court hearings in Boston to
determine whether the 1995 indictments against the pair should be

FBI IN DENIAL AS BULGER BREAKS DRUG PACT IN SOUTHIE

   (This Globe Spotlight Team series was prepared by editor Gerard
O'Neill and reporters Dick Lehr, Mitchell Zuckoff and Shelley
Murphy. This installment was written by Zuckoff.)
</P>
<P>
   BOSTON _ If James ``Whitey'' Bulger was keeping South Boston
safe from drugs, somebody forgot to tell Patricia Murray.
</P>
<P>
   At the height of Bulger's reign, Murray awoke every day with
three strikes against her: parochial school dropout, eight-year
addict, veteran hooker. In 1987, the Southie native told a
policeman she would continue selling sex to buy drugs _ despite
having AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you think I like going out on the street? Well, I don't,''
Murray, then 29, declared at the time, a maze of sores covering her
thin legs. But, she added, ``I'm not going to be in physical pain
for nobody on the face of this earth.''
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, Murray's AIDS claim was a ploy, calculated to
win admission to a drug-treatment program. But there was a bigger,
deadlier sham at work: It was the myth that _ thanks to Whitey _
people like Murray didn't exist in South Boston.
</P>
<P>
   The gangster might bankrupt a family with predatory loans, or
commandeer a local business, or crush a few thumbs over gambling
debts. And sure, rivals and suspected rats turned up dead, if they
turned up at all.
</P>
<P>
   But drugs? That, the myth held, was verboten. In exchange for
closing its eyes to Whitey's rackets, Southie's sons and daughters
would be protected from dealers and addicted acolytes.
</P>
<P>
   Now, however, based on extensive interviews, previously secret
documents, and recent testimony from law-enforcement agents during
federal court hearings, a picture emerges that explodes the myth.
South Boston spent much of Bulger's heyday _ from his recruitment
as an FBI informant in 1975 to his indictment 20 years later _
awash in drugs from Broadway to Castle Island, with Bulger
allegedly swimming in the proceeds. It wasn't that Southie was
worse off than other parts of Boston during the 1980s, but neither
was it an island apart.
</P>
<P>
   The new information reveals in detail how Bulger allegedly made
dealers pay ``rent'' on every gram of ``Santa Claus'' _ a Southie
code for cocaine. They also show how Bulger foiled repeated
attempts to indict him, despite a steady drumbeat of reports about
his demands for a share of everything from nickel bags to kilos,
loose joints to burlap-wrapped bales of pot. One dealer alone said
he sold tons of marijuana with Bulger's OK, then paid a
half-million dollars in rent.
</P>
<P>
   Bulger's teflon coating can now be firmly attributed to his FBI
handlers, who treated his antidrug pronouncements as ``evidence''
of his honor and value.
</P>
<P>
   The newly disclosed documents show that while Bulger and his
partner, Stephen ``The Rifleman'' Flemmi, were tightening their
noose on Southie drug dollars, their power was being downplayed by
the FBI agents who protected them in exchange for intelligence on
the Italian mob.
</P>
<P>
   ``Source stated that Bulger and Flemmi will occasionally `clout'
a drug dealer, but they are strictly after money and won't handle
drugs or have anyone around them that will handle drugs under any
circumstances,'' FBI agent John Connolly, Bulger's longtime
handler, reported in one confidential 1987 memo. FBI documents show
agents repeating those lines over the years while admitting they
did little to verify the information, as though Bulger's word was
proof enough.
</P>
<P>
   In the largest sense, the new materials reveal the drug
pronouncement to be a convenient fiction, with a dual purpose
apparent only in hindsight: It bolstered the neighborhood's
self-image after years of busing pain, while helping the FBI to
justify its cozy relationship with Bulger.
</P>
<P>
   And so, the insular ``Town'' and the elite law-enforcement
agency would spend years in shared denial, embracing the Bulger
known to friends as Jimmy, ignoring the anonymous Patricias. No one
would mention that narcotics cases were doubling at South Boston
District Court from 1985-'90. No one would wonder why yearly drug
arrests were tripling in Southie between 1980 and 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Even when the troubles were under Bulger's own roof _ a son of
Teresa Stanley, his longtime companion, struggled with drugs _ the
neighborhood would treat it as nobody's business.
</P>
<P>
   And while Patricia Murray was developing a $250-a-day habit and
selling herself to support it, the South Boston Information Center
would boldly declare that prostitution and drugs ``are a way of
life in other sections of the city, but they will not be tolerated
in South Boston.''
</P>
<P>
   The FBI was no better, turning a deaf ear to its own
surveillance tapes. Nobody knew the geography of Boston's
underworld as well as Mafia boss Gennaro Angiulo. In 1981, Angiulo
was recorded saying, ``Whitey's got the whole of Southie. Stevie
has got the whole of the South End.''
</P>
<P>
   As cocaine dealer Thomas Cahill told an undercover Drug
Enforcement Administration agent in 1988, that Mafia-sanctioned
authority gave Southie drug dealers three choices: ``You either pay
Whitey Bulger, or you don't deal, or you wind up dead.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
AGENT IN DENIAL
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   No one was deeper in denial than the FBI's Connolly _ whose
handling of Bulger eventually triggered the agency's biggest crisis
involving an informant. In a recent interview, he said flatly: ``I
don't believe they were involved in drugs.'' He later added, ``I
have never seen, and am still waiting to see, any credible evidence
that they were involved in drugs.''
</P>
<P>
   Connolly's statement _ coming three years after Bulger and
Flemmi were indicted on drug-related extortion and racketeering
charges, as well as other crimes _ reflects nothing so much as the
convoluted logic of Bulger himself.
</P>
<P>
   And therein lies the key to Bulger's approach to drugs, and to
some extent the key to his relationship with Connolly's FBI: To the
self-styled moral gangster and his loyal FBI handler, drug money
was separate from the drugs themselves.
</P>
<P>
   In this world view, Bulger's hands were clean because he didn't
personally supply users; he simply made the world safe for dealers
in exchange for a piece of the action. As ridiculous as that might
seem, there was a revealing precedent: Bulger took the same
approach to alcohol.
</P>
<P>
   During two decades as Bulger's companion, Stanley says he struck
her on only one occasion: after she had stayed out late at a
friend's house, drinking wine. He hated to see people drink, she
said in an interview. If she sipped two drinks he acted as if she
had guzzled a dozen. ``I almost got killed for drinking a couple of
glasses of wine,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Even on St. Patrick's Day, Bulger the fitness fanatic would
complain about celebrants drinking at midday. In 1985, Bulger
confided to a DEA agent that he ``didn't trust anyone who drank,
because...they were weak'' and might rat him out.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, at the same time he was berating his girlfriend for
wine-tasting and worrying about drunken rats, Bulger was his
neighborhood's biggest liquor supplier. He happily emptied the
register at the South Boston Liquor Mart, which he controlled from
1984 onward. Questioned in late 1985 by Boston police about a wad
of cash found in his car, Bulger teased: ``We have the busiest
liquor store around.''
</P>
<P>
   To claim Bulger was antidrugs because he didn't personally deal
cocaine would be like saying he was a Prohibitionist because he
didn't personally bag six-packs at his liquor store. When it came
to both alcohol and drugs, he set aside personal distaste and found
an equal opportunity to profit.
</P>
<P>
   Some drug investigators saw through Bulger. ``He might not sell
them, but he profits from them,'' Paul Brown, formerly
second-in-command of Boston's DEA office, said in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Even some FBI agents were uncomfortable. Robert Fitzpatrick, a
former FBI agent, wanted Bulger cut off as an informant in the
early 1980s, he testified in April at federal hearings on the
legality of the 1995 indictments. In Fitzpatrick's eyes, ``a lot of
the drug people may have been paying tribute to this guy... which
is not something that I felt we should be involved in.''
</P>
<P>
   But with Connolly in Bulger's corner, the favorite-son treatment
continued, and Bulger avoided drug charges throughout the 1980s,
despite two determined efforts to ensnare him.
</P>
<P>
   The full story of those two efforts can only be told now.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
A LEAGUE OF THEIR OWN
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Although Bulger and Flemmi were in their own league as FBI
informants, they weren't the only criminals talking to authorities.
For more than a decade, a surprising number of people risked
reprisal by telling local, state, and federal authorities of the
pair's drug activities.
</P>
<P>
   There was DEA snitch ``C-1,'' who in 1981 said Bulger and Flemmi
were demanding cash payment from all area drug dealers; there was
``Smith,'' a Massachusetts State Police mole who said Bulger and
Flemmi had set up a pay-as-you-deal system where dealers could pay
them a fixed fee or a percentage of their profits; in 1988 there
was DEA informant ``C-6,'' who said dealers were complaining that
the ``rent'' charged by Bulger and Flemmi was driving Southie
cocaine prices through the roof, reaching $28,000 per kilogram, up
from $20,000 previously.
</P>
<P>
   Quincy police were hearing similar reports. One confidential
memo says Flemmi was offering $75,000 to find people who owned
small boats to off-load a large shipment of drugs. There were many
more, like convicted drug smuggler Arnold Katz, who in 1981 told a
DEA agent that fellow drug smuggler Frank Lepere routinely gave
Bulger and Flemmi suitcases filled with drug money, to guarantee
him protection from Salvatore Michael Caruana, a Mafia drug lord.

 BOSTON: ... Mafia drug lord.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   With reports like those swirling around, Quincy Police Detective
Richard Bergeron sat at his typewriter on June 19, 1983, and banged
out the words ``Top Secret.'' He would then go on to propose a
sophisticated investigation of Bulger and Flemmi for alleged
extortion of drug dealers, among other crimes.
</P>
<P>
   That memo from a cop in Quincy _ where Bulger was living at the
time in a luxury waterfront apartment _ set in motion ``Operation
Beans.'' It eventually would involve Quincy police, the DEA, the
Massachusetts State Police and the US Attorney's office in Boston.
But it would end in mid-1985 amid disappointment and, later,
embarrassing revelations.
</P>
<P>
   At the outset, Bergeron displayed prescience about the risks
involved: ``The success or failure of the mission depends on strict
compliance with security provisions which must be developed and
adhered to without exception,'' he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Bergeron, who has since become police chief in Webster, was well
aware that an attempt by State Police to catch Bulger and Flemmi in
a loan-sharking and gambling probe in 1980-'81 had failed; rumors
abounded that the two had been tipped off to a bug in a North End
garage that was their headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   And just two months before Bergeron wrote his memo, federal
agents seized 10 tons of marijuana from a cinder-block warehouse on
D Street in Southie. An FBI agent testified this year that Bulger
was tipped off in advance of that bust; afterward, Bulger
supposedly used the knowledge to demand that the Charlestown dealer
pay him $90,000 for using Southie as a storage site without
permission.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Bergeron's precautions, Bulger and Flemmi's luck held
true during Operation Beans. Public and confidential documents, as
well as interviews, suggest that the two gangsters benefited from
what Connolly's former FBI supervisor John Morris said was an
expectation that they would get ``a head start'' on investigations
against them. Flemmi himself said in a sworn statement: ``Both in
1984 and 1989, the FBI made Mr. Bulger and I aware of a number of
drug investigations.''
</P>
<P>
   There is no doubt that in the months after Quincy police and the
DEA teamed up to target the pair, the FBI got wind of the
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   In April 1984, an anonymous teletype was sent from the FBI
Boston office to the agency's Washington headquarters, reporting
that FBI informants Bulger and Flemmi had been targeted in a probe
of a ``large-scale cocaine and marijuana trafficking organization,
controlled by the `Irish mob' in Boston.''
</P>
<P>
   The primary purpose of the memo was to convince Washington FBI
officials not to cut loose Bulger as an informant. In part, the
memo stressed that, ``at present, DEA allegations are
unsubstantiated and DEA has furnished no specific information
relative to involvement of (Bulger) in criminal activities.''
</P>
<P>
   The memo worked, and Bulger remained an FBI source. The
lingering question was: When the FBI was discussing the
investigation, did someone spill Operation Beans to Bulger?
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
TIP-OFF PUTS END TO PROBE
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In December 1984, while the investigation was still moving
forward,
</P>
<P>
   Assistant US Attorney Gary Crossen successfully won a court's
permission to wiretap Bulger. But Bulger was never caught making
incriminating statements or seen in any compromising positions;
soon, the probe would end. Badly.
</P>
<P>
   On March 11, 1985, Bulger and his friend Kevin Weeks drove
Bulger's bugged car into a garage on Old Colony Avenue in South
Boston. DEA agent Steven Boeri was monitoring the bug _ which had
only been in place a few days _ when Boeri realized that Bulger and
Weeks had found the listening device.
</P>
<P>
   Boeri and other flustered agents rushed into the garage to
retrieve the expensive equipment. They soon found themselves
chatting with Bulger, who said he was impressed the DEA was able to
bypass his car alarm; later, Flemmi would playfully promise not to
reveal the DEA's surveillance methods.
</P>
<P>
   Two days after the bug was blown, Boeri and Bergeron were
following Bulger. The gangster spotted the tail and waved the
lawmen over to him. Bulger complained the removal of the bug had
created a draft in his car; Boeri showed him how to fix it.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, the lack of success seemed like simple bad luck for
the DEA and Quincy police. But unknown to those investigators, on
the same days Bulger was chatting with Boeri, he also was talking
to the FBI's Connolly.
</P>
<P>
   On March 11, 1985, the day Bulger found the bug, Connolly wrote
a confidential one-page memo saying Bulger had spotted Quincy
police watching him; two days later, on the same day Boeri helped
Bulger fix his car, Connolly wrote another memo, saying Bulger told
him about finding the bug.
</P>
<P>
   In Connolly's memos, the information always seemed to flow one
way: from Bulger to Connolly. But recently, questions have arisen
about whether it was really a two-way street.
</P>
<P>
   In April, former Boston FBI agent Rod Kennedy testified that in
1984, a high-ranking Washington FBI official was told of DEA plans
to bug Bulger and Flemmi. Troubled that another federal agency was
targeting FBI informants, he called the Boston FBI office for an
explanation. As it happened, Kennedy testified, the only person in
the squad room was Connolly, who by answering the phone received
advance knowledge of DEA bugging plans.
</P>
<P>
   Connolly has repeatedly denied using his knowledge to tip off
Bulger and Flemmi. But others have voiced doubts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We never determined why the investigation failed,'' Crossen,
the former federal prosecutor, testified in May. ``It clearly, in
my mind, had been compromised.'' Crossen said he did not know who
to blame, but when asked if he suspected it was related to Bulger
and Flemmi's FBI relationship, he said icily: ``That was one of a
bunch of different scenarios that occurred to me.''
</P>
<P>
   An embarrassing postscript to Operation Beans was written by
Boeri, who acknowledged under oath that after the investigation
failed, he sent Bulger and Flemmi a congratulations card. He also
sent a tape of military marches to Flemmi, a former Army
paratrooper, and gave both men cigars after his wife gave birth.
</P>
<P>
   The reason for his largesse? ``I was trying to schmooze them,''
Boeri said outside court, ``so they would become (DEA)
informants.'' But he had been a decade behind the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the failure of Operation Beans, the informant reports
kept arriving about Bulger and Flemmi's drug doings.
</P>
<P>
   In 1989, Boston Police detectives James P. Carr and Frank Dewan
were part of a team that tried to put it all together. Carr wrote a
118-page affidavit seeking permission to bug mobile phones
belonging to Bulger and Weeks. Its chief conclusion: ``Informant
information gathered during 1984 and during 1987-'89 confirm that
persons engaged in illegal activity in South Boston must pay James
Bulger in order to operate.''
</P>
<P>
   Particularly revealing was the work of an undercover DEA agent
named Bonnie Alexander, who repeatedly purchased cocaine from
Thomas Cahill, a dealer who couldn't seem to stop talking about the
influence Bulger exerted over the drug trade.
</P>
<P>
   During one drug buy after another at a hotel bar, Cahill
outlined the hierarchy of the South Boston drug distribution
network, and each time Bulger would come out on top. ``Cahill said
`Whitey' Bulger controls South Boston, and the power to do that was
worth anything,'' Alexander said.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation would result in the August 1990 indictments of
51 persons on drug charges. Among them were the lieutenants and
soldiers in four Southie drug rings that law-enforcement officials
said operated under Bulger's authority; one indictment even
outlined Bulger's alleged extortion of drug dealers, based on
Cahill's claims.
</P>
<P>
   Though the investigation stopped short of assembling enough
evidence to indict Bulger and Flemmi, the DEA was almost giddy
about the prospect of quickly nailing the two men and debunking the
myth. Paul Brown of the DEA even claimed that the indictments would
spell the end for Whitey.
</P>
<P>
   But it would take nearly five more years for that to occur. And
it would come only after the retirement of John Connolly from the
FBI, after Bulger was ``closed'' as an informant, after several of
those indicted in 1990 turned on Bulger and Flemmi, and after the
FBI finally accepted the view of its law-enforcement colleagues
that Bulger and Flemmi were far more trouble than they were worth.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
BULGER'S LATE PAYMENT PENALTY
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the clearest illustration of how Bulger did business
under FBI protection comes from a series of related events in 1989,
later described in affidavits and indictments.
</P>
<P>
   Cahill, the drug dealer, had been robbed of $125,000 while
trying to buy cocaine in Florida. Tough luck. Upon his return to
Boston, he was told he still owed Bulger $40,000 in ``rent.''
</P>
<P>
   Cahill lacked ``product'' to raise the money, so Bulger's crew
told him to see a former Southie bar owner named Timothy Connolly,
who was working as a mortgage broker. Though he was reluctant to
process a loan to repay a cocaine debt, Tim Connolly eventually
helped Cahill obtain a second mortgage. But Bulger considered
himself a preferred customer, and he expected faster service.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after the loan closed in August 1989, Tim Connolly was
summoned to the Rotary Variety Store _ next to the South Boston
Liquor Mart _ and escorted to a back room by Bulger and Flemmi.
</P>
<P>
   Spewing expletives, Bulger pulled a long knife from a sheath on
his leg and repeatedly stabbed nearby liquor boxes. Then he put the
knife to Connolly's shirt and said he could buy his life. The
price: $50,000. Over time, he paid $35,000, and the debt was deemed
to have been settled.
</P>
<P>
   As it happened, the federal and state investigators who were
targeting Bulger on drug charges learned of the Cahill mortgage _
though they were unaware of the knifepoint collection efforts.
Looking for information on money-laundering by Bulger, they
subpoenaed Connolly before the federal grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   But Connolly _ who sources say was willing to cooperate _ never
appeared before that grand jury. Rather than making him part of the
DEA drug investigation, sources said, federal prosecutors turned
Connolly over to the FBI, but used him in a different drug probe.
That move effectively steered him away _ and kept Bulger safe _
from the August 1990 indictments.
</P>
<P>
   It took five more years, but Connolly's allegations were
ultimately part of the 1995 racketeering indictment.
</P>
<P>
   To this day, DEA officials maintain they would have had enough
evidence to charge Bulger and Flemmi in 1990 if Tim Connolly had
been made available to them. The plan, they said, would have been
to fit him with a body microphone and catch the gangsters making
incriminating statements.
</P>
<P>
   But nothing was ever so simple when it came to Bulger and
Flemmi. Last year, Flemmi claimed he and Bulger had been warned in
advance that Tim Connolly was cooperating with investigators and
might be wearing a wire.
</P>
<P>
   The tip, he said, came from the usual source: the FBI.

   BOSTON _ In 1988 Whitey Bulger's special relationship with the
FBI _ an informant who was handled by FBI agent John Connolly _ was
disclosed publicly for the first time in a Globe story.
</P>
<P>
   During interviews at the time and afterward, three key federal
law enforcement officials challenged the account: Connolly;
Jeremiah T. O'Sullivan, the region's top organized-crime
prosecutor; and James Ahearn, the special agent in charge of the
FBI's Boston office. The comments the three officials made a decade
ago are now sharply contradicted by this year's release of FBI
files and court testimony.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   JEREMIAH T. O'SULLIVAN &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Then: ``I don't buy it,'' said O'Sullivan in 1988, when asked
about Bulger being an FBI informant. ``I've heard the stories. I
don't know it to be true.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Now: FBI records, testimony, and interviews suggest that, as
far back as 1979, agents _ including Connolly _ discussed Bulger
with O'Sullivan. O'Sullivan attended meetings in 1980 with other
officials to review the FBI's handling of Bulger, and one agent
testified that O'Sullivan urged the FBI not to close out Bulger.
</P>
<P>
   The records and testimony notwithstanding, O'Sullivan last year
insisted to FBI investigators that he was never officially told
that Bulger was an FBI informant while he was a prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   JOHN CONNOLLY &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Then: In 1990, two years after the Globe story, Connolly
sought out a top Globe editor to denounce the coverage and to
insist that, even though he knew who Whitey Bulger was, he had
never talked to him.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Now: FBI records, court testimony by other agents, and
Connolly's own public comments indicate that Connolly has met and
talked with Bulger over a hundred times since 1975.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   JAMES AHEARN &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Then: ``That is absolutely untrue,'' Ahearn said in 1988, when
asked about Bulger having a longstanding relationship with the FBI.
``We specifically deny that there has been special treatment of
this individual.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Now: Previously-secret FBI files show that Ahearn was
intimately involved in defending Connolly and the FBI's use of
Bulger. Less than a year after public comments denying the ties
between the FBI and Bulger, Ahearn in early 1989 wrote a
confidential memo to the FBI director trumpeting Bulger ``as the
most important organized-crime informant for many years.''

AGENTS GAVE BULGER A STARRING ROLE _ BUT WAS IT REAL?

   (This Globe Spotlight Team series was prepared by editor Gerard
O'Neill and reporters Dick Lehr, Mitchell Zuckoff and Shelley
Murphy. This installment was written by O'Neill.)
</P>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Hands clasped behind his head and cowboy boots plunked
on a coffee table, a relaxed James J. ``Whitey'' Bulger awaited the
start of a meeting called to see if he would be fired as an FBI
informant.
</P>
<P>
   It was November 1980, and top agents from the Boston FBI office
had summoned Bulger to the secret meeting at the Hilton Hotel at
Logan Airport to decide whether the gangster could continue his
moonlighting job or would be cut loose because he had become more
trouble than he was worth. As things played out, Bulger's cocky
nonchalance was not misplaced.
</P>
<P>
   But the four-hour session unfolded at a time of intense pressure
for the Boston FBI, which was fending off charges of corruption
about Bulger while it was also assembling its D-Day case against
the New England Mafia. For months, a score of agents had been
working day and night on plans to wiretap Gennaro Angiulo's
headquarters at 98 Prince St. in Boston's North End. Lives and
careers were on the line.
</P>
<P>
   And a black cloud hung over the preparations: Whitey Bulger.
</P>
<P>
   At the highest level, FBI brass was wrestling with complaints
from top Massachusetts State Police officers about agents having
been compromised in their dealings with Bulger's Irish Mob.
</P>
<P>
   Just three months before the hotel meeting, Massachusetts State
Police had suffered the collapse of a gambling and loansharking
investigation of Bulger's Winter Hill gang and its loose
affiliation with the Mafia. State Police were blaming it on the
FBI, particularly FBI supervisor John Morris, who had blurted out
to a Boston cop that if the gang's garage on Lancaster Street near
Boston Garden was bugged, the wise guys ``are aware of it.''
</P>
<P>
   In the weeks that followed, as the FBI's Mafia probe reached a
critical stage, decisions had to be made within the bureau whether
to sever ties with Bulger over the garage debacle.
</P>
<P>
   As a decision neared, Bulger, Morris, and agent John Connolly,
Bulger's day-to-day handler, teamed up to preserve the status quo.
The result: Give Bulger a starring role in the Mafia investigation
as it wound down, pinning a badge on his chest to deflect flak from
Lancaster Street.
</P>
<P>
   It proved to be a masterstroke. Whenever law-enforcement critics
raised the issue of Bulger's growing criminal empire and FBI
protection, bureau leaders would be reassured by Morris, Connolly,
and others that it was all just petty rivalry and, besides, Bulger
was the guy who had delivered the mob, the agency's number one
priority.
</P>
<P>
   But did he?
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, Connolly has made a mantra of Bulger's
contribution in taking down the local mob, calling it a ``brilliant
business decision'' in which the government traded one bad guy for
stone Mafia killers.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent interview, Connolly again defended his relationship
with Bulger, saying, ``When you're going after lions and tigers,
you have to deal with lions and tigers.''
</P>
<P>
   But now, once-secret FBI documents, interviews with sources
inside and outside law enforcement, and recent court testimony show
Bulger deserves little credit for the biggest organized-crime case
in Boston history: the fall of the Angiulo Mafia family.
</P>
<P>
   Bulger's billing as a Mafia slayer stands as the ultimate
embellishment, the biggest in a series of exaggerated reports
designed to prop up his shaky standing as a top-tier informant. And
it also obscures a little-known fact _ that Bulger was far more
involved in ratting out his own rivals within the Irish Winter Hill
gang.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A NEW MAN IN TOWN
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence Sarhatt may have been new to the Boston office of the
FBI in May 1980, but as the special agent in charge _ the top
official in a branch FBI office _ he quickly became concerned that
things were not as advertised with Bulger.
</P>
<P>
   When Sarhatt learned of the Lancaster Street problems and the
complaints by the State Police, his initial reaction was to end
Bulger's five-year tenure as an informant.
</P>
<P>
   That was a dire prospect for Connolly and Morris, who relied
heavily on Bulger and knew how difficult it was to develop
well-placed sources in criminal enterprises. They had bet their
careers on Bulger and seemed to be losing. But they were also
convinced Bulger was the most valuable informant the FBI had so
they scrambled quickly to keep him, bombarding the brass with memos
on Bulger's sudden role in the Angiulo case and other matters.
</P>
<P>
   Connolly started the damage control in October by writing in a
report that Bulger claimed he learned about the garage bugs from a
State Police source _ not the FBI. According to the report, Bulger
complained that State Police were conspiring with political enemies
of Bulger's brother, then-Senate President William M. Bulger, to
embarrass the family.
</P>
<P>
   The next move belonged to Morris. In November 1980 _ shortly
before the Logan Hilton meeting with Sarhatt _ Morris sent Bulger
and his longtime partner, Stephen ``The Rifleman'' Flemmi, who was
trusted by Mafia leaders, into Angiulo headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   Bulger and Flemmi made their way to Prince Street, a narrow,
North End street where outsiders were stared down in the old-world
neighborhood long dominated by the Angiulos. All five Angiulo
brothers once worked in the family's grocery store that extended
credit to those short on cash.
</P>
<P>
   Bulger and Flemmi were asked to find out if there was an alarm
system at 98 Prince St. that would interfere with covert entry. The
pair found nothing useful about alarms, but Flemmi produced a
drawing of Angiulo's L-shaped office _ a sketch that was
superfluous given all the other information the FBI had assembled
about the mob headquarters. But it was enough to get both Flemmi
and Bulger included as informants on the sworn affidavit the FBI
used to persuade a judge to authorize a wiretap.
</P>
<P>
   The strategy folded Bulger into the coup that toppled Angiulo.
Since the bugs produced immediate evidence against Angiulo,
Bulger's status was salvaged. In a matter of weeks, he was once
again regarded as the agency's key informant.
</P>
<P>
   And the gregarious and street-smart Connolly soon became
established as the gatekeeper to what his FBI bosses would know
about Bulger. It mostly boiled down to this: Bulger was invaluable
because he was helping take down La Cosa Nostra, the agency's top
priority, with glory in it for all hands. Eventually, everyone fell
in line.
</P>
<P>
   But in the tense days of November 1980, the skeptical Sarhatt
pressed forward, brushing aside the paper proclamations. He
demanded a meeting with Bulger to satisfy himself that a bank
robber from South Boston had not become the tail wagging the FBI's
dog.
</P>
<P>
   One agent looks back on it with disdain, saying Sarhatt was ``in
over his head. He walks into Boston, this buzz saw, and everyone's
furious.''
</P>
<P>
   In any event, a room was booked at the Logan Hilton. In a
meeting that lasted several hours, Bulger leaned back comfortably
on a chair and told Sarhatt he learned about the Lancaster Street
garage bugs not from a friend at the FBI, but from a State Police
source he refused to identify, according to FBI documents.
</P>
<P>
   To this day, that refusal to identify the source is viewed as a
brazen breach of informant protocol that rankles former State
Police officials who believe the tip came from Morris or Connolly,
not one of their own.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was outrageous,'' said Robert Long, a former State Police
investigator who worked on the Lancaster Street case. ``An
informant who refuses to talk about leaks should be closed down
immediately. Otherwise, you're losing control of manipulative
people who are always looking for an edge. You plug the leak or
close the source.''
</P>
<P>
   Less than a week after the hotel meeting, Sarhatt's threat to
close out Bulger receded after he conferred with a key
law-enforcement ally of Connolly and Morris, federal
organized-crime prosecutor Jeremiah T. O'Sullivan. Moving quickly
to counter the State Police, O'Sullivan told Sarhatt it was
``crucial'' that the agency retain Bulger as an informant because
of his ongoing value in getting bugs into Angiulo's office, FBI
records show.
</P>
<P>
   O'Sullivan, who would win racketeering convictions against the
Angiulos in a career-building case in 1986, has insisted in the
past that he never knew that Bulger was an informer while he was a
federal prosecutor. His lawyer, Hugh Scott, declined to elaborate,
saying it would be inappropriate because O'Sullivan may be a
witness when hearings resume.
</P>
<P>
   But while O`Sullivan was declining comment, Connolly raised the
ante on the crosscurrents still flowing from Lancaster Street. In a
recent Globe interview, he contended O'Sullivan tipped him off
about the State Police operation _ even though Connolly says he
already knew about it from Flemmi. ``My point is,'' said Connolly,
``here is O'Sullivan (now) saying he never knew they were sources,
(but) he was warning me to tip them off.''
</P>
<P>
   In any event, Bulger and Flemmi were just two of nine
confidential informants or ``CIs'' used to obtain the bug, and by
no means were they the most valuable. That distinction went to
someone who couldn't have been more different from the two South
Boston gangsters.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A BOOKIE EVENS THE SCORE
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The key to getting inside the Mafia's Boston boardroom was
detailed information about Angiulo's lucrative gambling and
loan-sharking business, which was yielding $45,000 a day in gross
receipts.
</P>
<P>
   While Bulger worked closely with some Mafia soldiers, that was
information he simply didn't have.

O'Neill and reporters Dick Lehr, Mitchell Zuckoff and Shelley
Murphy. This installment was written by Lehr and Murphy.)
</P>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Under a harvest moon, FBI agent John J. Connolly eased
his beat-up Plymouth into a space along a deserted Wollaston Beach
in Quincy. He sat waiting. Behind him, harbor waters stirred and,
farther off, the Boston skyline sparkled.
</P>
<P>
   It was the fall of 1975, a time when the city was in the grip of
a nightmare _ the busing crisis _ and striving toward a dream _ a
World Series.
</P>
<P>
   But the FBI agent had other things on his mind.
</P>
<P>
   The passenger door suddenly opened. Seemingly in a flash, and
seemingly from nowhere, the visitor Connolly had been expecting
slid into the front seat. James J. ``Whitey'' Bulger had arrived,
responding to Connolly's request for a meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``What the hell did you do, parachute in?'' Connolly asked the
gangster, who had parked his car several blocks away and carefully
come up behind Connolly from the beach.
</P>
<P>
   Under the cover of darkness, the two men then started talking
about a deal that would leave an indelible mark on Massachusetts
law enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   Bulger, already a legend in the making, would agree to provide
the FBI with underworld secrets. His ``handler'' would be Connolly.
At 35, he was 11 years younger than Bulger, but a fellow native son
of South Boston and already a devoted Bulger family partisan.
They'd started out in the same housing project in Southie, where
Connolly was tantalized by tales of a flamboyant streetfighter
named Jimmy, and awed by the more serious and studious brother of
future political fame, Billy.
</P>
<P>
   Lining up Bulger as an informant was surely a coup in the FBI's
crusade against the local Mafia, whd a Mafia conspiracy.
</P>
<P>
   But the arrangement would veer wildly off track.
</P>
<P>
   The nation's elite crime-fighting agency gradually was co-opted,
finally careening off a cliff in its protection of the prized
Bulger. It was a scandal in progress for two decades, but one
always kept tightly under wraps, a closely-guarded FBI affair.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, however, the bureau was required to confirm publicly
what it had always steadfastly denied, even after the Globe
published a report in 1988 disclosing the troubling ties between
Bulger and the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   But more startling than the belated official admission were the
details about a deal that was deeper, dirtier, and more personal
than most anyone had imagined.
</P>
<P>
   The alliance between the FBI, Bulger, and his sidekick, Stephen
``The Rifleman'' Flemmi, featured a handful of agents and two
gangsters who quickly became intoxicated with themselves and their
power. They'd meet for dinner, socialize, and at least on one
occasion, Bill Bulger himself popped in, according to recent
testimony.
</P>
<P>
   If they'd wanted to, Whitey Bulger and Flemmi could have held
their wine glasses high and toasted their success in outwitting not
only the Mafia but also the dozens of state troopers, federal drug
agents, and local cops who tried relentlessly to build a case
against them.
</P>
<P>
   The gangsters and lawmen exchanged gifts, money, and secrets.
But now the party is over. The history of crimefighting by the FBI
Boston office no longer centers on a string of celebrated Mafia
takedowns in the 1980s; it now requires a cold retelling
incorporating the dealings between Bulger and a tarnished
law-enforcement agency.
</P>
<P>
   In eight days last April, John Morris, Connolly's former
supervisor, staggered the Boston office with his confessions about
payoffs and leaks, about his being seduced by Connolly's brash
patter and ties to the Bulger brothers, about his own corruption in
taking bribes from Whitey Bulger that, in some instances, he said
were brought to him by Connolly.
</P>
<P>
   Today a fuller account can be assembled from interviews, the
sworn testimony of agents, and from once-secret FBI files about the
fugitive Bulger, Flemmi, and Mafia boss Francis ``Cadillac Frank''
Salemme, all now charged with racketeering.
</P>
<P>
   Taken together, the materials reveal the deep commingling of two
groups the public would ordinarily expect to be at odds: FBI agents
and powerful underworld gang leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Looking back, one thing is certain: The deal struck in 1975
proved to be career-enhancing for the two principals. Connolly rode
Bulger to star status in the Boston office as a valued handler of
top-echelon informants, and Bulger rode his ties to the FBI to
enormous underworld power and riches. During the recent hearings,
Connolly refused to testify under oath, citing his right against
self-incrimination, and prosecutors have refused to immunize him as
they investigate possible criminal charges against the former
agent.
</P>
<P>
   But Connolly, who retired in 1990, insists he has done no wrong.
In Globe interviews, he said that from the start the FBI and the
Justice Department allowed Bulger and Flemmi to commit certain
crimes short of murder and approved of how he managed the pair.
Now, said Connolly, he's the scapegoat.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're desperate to find someone to hang this all on and
they're certainly not going to blame themselves,'' Connolly said.
``They go down the ladder and find the guy who's holding the ladder
and blame him. That's what's happening here.''
</P>
<P>
   But other agents have taken the witness stand and placed
Connolly in the middle of the FBI misconduct, as the chief
manipulator of events that benefited a gangster he'd first met as a
boy in South Boston, a chance encounter at a corner drugstore that
Connolly says felt ``like meeting Ted Williams.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   BOYHOOD TIES IN SOUTH BOSTON
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Connolly's boyhood revolved around the Old Harbor tenements, the
first public housing project in New England. Nearby lived the
Bulgers, who'd taken up residence there when the project first
opened in 1938.
</P>
<P>
   The unruly Jimmy, the oldest Bulger later nicknamed Whitey
because of his blond hair, was already the talk of the project as a
leader of the Mercer Street gang. Billy Bulger, six years older
than Connolly, was quieter, more cerebral, and studious. Though the
Bulger brothers took off in different directions, they would each
rise to the top in their chosen professions _ one in crime, the
other politics.
</P>
<P>
   The young Connolly admired Billy Bulger, followed him home on
Sundays after Mass at St. Monica's, and was impressed by his
bookishness. Whitey was more the unseen hellion, and not until
Connolly was eight years old did he actually meet him.
</P>
<P>
   Wandering into a corner drugstore to eyeball some penny candy,
one of Connolly's pals whispered, ``There's Whitey Bulger.''
Impulsively, the skinny but tough-looking teenager offered to buy
the boys ice cream cones. While his friends eagerly placed their
orders, Connolly hesitated, taught never to accept anything from
strangers. Bulger, always one to take charge, quickly did so.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, kid, I'm no stranger,'' Connolly recalls Bulger saying.
``Your mother and father are from Ireland. My mother and father are
from Ireland. I am no stranger. What kind of ice cream do you
want?'' Connolly chose vanilla and Bulger hoisted him onto the
counter to receive his treat.
</P>
<P>
   Their next encounter came later that same year. Connolly found
himself in a skirmish over a ball with some older boys.
Outnumbered, he was getting the worst of it. Suddenly Bulger was
there and scared the assailants away. ``He appeared out of nowhere,
but I was glad he showed up when he did,'' recalls Connolly.
</P>
<P>
   Connolly's family moved out of the project and uptown to City
Point when he was 12. He grew up, attended Boston College at Billy
Bulger's urging, and then joined the FBI. By the 1950s, Whitey
Bulger was a bona-fide gangster, and in 1956 he was apprehended
following a wild spree of robbing banks. Pleading guilty, Bulger
was sentenced to 20 years in federal prison. He spent a few years
in Alcatraz, volunteered to take LSD in government-run experiments
to shorten his sentence, and returned to Boston after an early
parole in March 1965.
</P>
<P>
   By the time of the fateful meeting at Wollaston Beach 10 years
later, Connolly had been in the Boston office of the FBI for two
years, having won a transfer from New York in 1973. Bulger,
meanwhile, was an established force in the Somerville-based Winter
Hill gang that was immersed in loan sharking, illegal gambling, and
fixing horse races.
</P>
<P>
   Bulger had also teamed up with Flemmi, who was already several
years into his own deal with the FBI. The arrangement had proven
useful to both sides. The FBI obtained inside criminal information
and Flemmi got the FBI off his back. Bulger had even been
approached in the early 1970s by Connolly's FBI supervisor, Dennis
Condon, but nothing much had come from that overture.
</P>
<P>
   Then came Connolly's pitch. He had the inside track Condon did
not. Bulger, several years later, would tell an FBI supervisor ``he
has a close feeling towards John Connolly because they both grew up
in the same neighborhood.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I just want you to hear me out,'' Connolly recalls telling
Bulger that first night at the beach. Word on the street was that
his Winter Hill gang was on the verge of a war with the local Mafia
run by Gennaro ``Jerry'' Angiulo in a dispute over the placement of
mob-controlled vending machines.
</P>
<P>
   Connolly says he warned Bulger that it wouldn't be a battle
fought on the street because the powerful Angiulo family would use
its corrupt police contacts to set up Bulger and his gang.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hear Jerry is feeding information to law enforcement to get
you pinched,'' Connolly said. ``I have a proposal. Why don't you
use us to do what they're doing to you? Fight fire with fire.''
</P>
<P>
   The offer was that simple: Use the FBI to eliminate his Mafia
rivals. If that alone wasn't reason enough, there was a bonus:
Cooperating meant the FBI would not be out looking to take Bulger
down, and percolating at that very moment was a loan-sharking probe
in which his name had surfaced.
</P>
<P>
   Bulger was intrigued, and he told Connolly: ``You can't survive
without friends in law enforcement.''
</P>
<P>
   The agent and the gangster met again several weeks later to
cement the deal. Connolly recalls Bulger saying that while the
Mafia can ``play checkers, we'll play chess.''
</P>
<P>
   So it began: Whitey Bulger and the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   BULGER AS AN `INVESTMENT'
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the beginning the arrangement may have actually made sense.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without informants, we're nothing,'' former FBI Director
Clarence Kelly once said. Moreover, beginning in the 1970s, the FBI
was in hot pursuit of its announced national priority _ La Cosa
Nostra. In this regard, Bulger and Flemmi were well positioned, two
ruthless enforcers whose gang regularly did business with the local
Mafia based in Boston's North End.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Flemmi was a favorite of several key Mafia leaders who
would try unsuccessfully over the years to persuade him to join up
with them.
</P>
<P>
   To this day, Connolly is unwavering in his belief that the FBI's
deal with Bulger and Flemmi was a no-brainer. In his view, they
gave the FBI the mob. ``We got 42 stone criminals by giving up two
stone criminals,'' he says. ``What's your return on investment
there? Show me a businessman who wouldn't do that.''
</P>
<P>
   And he says the historic deal was his alone to make: ``Whitey
only talked to me because he knew who I was and he knew me from
when I was a kid ... He knew I wasn't going to be wired up on him.
He knew I was friends with his brother Bill.''
</P>
<P>
   But Bulger and Flemmi were not sad-sack bookies merely satisfied
with rounding up illegal bets while tipping off the FBI to some
underworld dirt.
</P>
<P>
   Ambitious and violent, the two men were soon in charge of the
Winter Hill gang, committed to expanding their own criminal
network. Bulger became, as Connolly himself noted in an early FBI
report, the ``leader of the Irish Mafia.''

THE OFFICIAL BULGER FBI FILE: SOME TALL TALES 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.1997 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   (This Globe Spotlight Team series was prepared by editor Gerard
O'Neill and reporters Dick Lehr, Mitchell Zuckoff and Shelley
Murphy. This installment was written by Lehr.)
</P>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Day was night for gangster James J. ``Whitey'' Bulger,
which meant he often met with his FBI contact John Connolly while
most of Boston slept. Sometimes Connolly himself was asleep, dozing
off on the couch inside his home in South Boston while watching the
late news on TV. Connolly would leave the door unlocked, and Bulger
would let himself in.
</P>
<P>
   Over nearly two decades, there were more than a hundred of these
nighttime sessions. Besides Connolly's house, they'd meet at other
agents' homes. Or they'd meet in the middle of the Old Harbor
housing project in South Boston, where both men had once been boys.
Or they'd meet at Castle Island. Or Savin Hill Beach.
</P>
<P>
   Following most encounters, Connolly would write up an informant
report about the surreptitious chat. Eventually the FBI files in
Boston swelled with the internal reports: the underworld according
to Bulger, as authored by Connolly.
</P>
<P>
   The once-secret Bulger files now show that Connolly surely had a
way with words. Though these were the files relied upon by the FBI
brass to assess Bulger's value, Connolly's memos often read more
like the work of a publicist than that of an impartial FBI agent
chronicling Bulger's activities.
</P>
<P>
   Time and again, Bulger's contributions were embellished, in
cases that included solving bank robberies, saving agents' lives,
and even in bringing down Boston Mafia boss Gennaro Angiulo.
</P>
<P>
   There was, for example, the report Connolly crafted in
connection with the famous bank robbery of Depositors Trust in
Medford over Memorial Day weekend in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   Connolly and Bulger discussed the robbery afterwards; a few
months later Connolly credited Bulger with being the ``first
source'' to provide the names of the robbers.
</P>
<P>
   But the honor bestowed on Bulger just isn't so.
</P>
<P>
   The names of suspects were flying around the morning the bank
job was discovered. ``I'll be honest with you, I didn't get it from
Whitey Bulger,'' former Medford police chief Jake Keating recently
said about early leads. The morning after, said Keating and others,
callers to police identified the suspects. The case against them
took a few years to put together, but their identities, Keating
said, were ``common knowledge.''
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, no one doubts that Bulger, once he signed on with
Connolly in 1975, served as a proactive informant; along with
sidekick Stephen ``The Rifleman'' Flemmi, he offered the FBI a
stream of inside information about both the Mafia and many of their
own gangland associates. Connolly, meanwhile, scoffs at anyone who
challenges his handling of Bulger and Flemmi.
</P>
<P>
   But the claim Connolly made in the Medford case is not an
isolated instance of hype. In Connolly's hands, Bulger seemed
always to turn to gold. And padding Bulger's worth proved an
effective parry to those inside and outside of the FBI who began
questioning the relationship.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the starring role for Bulger that Connolly cultivated
held center stage throughout the 1980s. It was endorsed by the FBI
chain of command and received a crucial boost from Connolly's
immediate supervisor, John Morris. Morris regularly seconded
Connolly's exaggerated praise for Bulger.
</P>
<P>
   But a number of key claims Connolly made early on _ assertions
that helped cement an official view within the bureau of Bulger's
premium worth as a snitch _ crumble when measured against the
testimony of other FBI agents and other government records.
</P>
<P>
   Then last spring Morris disclosed his own motivation for wanting
to maintain smooth sailing with Bulger. Morris confessed he'd taken
payoffs from Bulger and Flemmi and leaked information to help them
outmaneuver other investigators. But in addition to wanting to keep
his own corruption hidden, Morris testified he'd also become
intimidated by the brash Connolly, who regularly flexed his
closeness to both Bulger brothers _ the gang leader, Whitey, and
Bill, then the state Senate president.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was much more influential than what you would normally
think an agent to be,'' Morris testified. ``He was a very connected
person inside the bureau, outside the bureau, and I did not want to
place myself in a position where I was in any strong opposition to
him.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
STATE POLICE SUSPECT A LEAK
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The '80s began in crisis for the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   State Police officials were developing strong suspicions about
the deal Bulger had with the FBI, and had gone so far as to accuse
the bureau of tipping off Bulger and Flemmi.
</P>
<P>
   While not confirming the informant relationship to the State
Police, the top FBI agent in Boston at the time, Larry Sarhatt,
nonetheless initiated an internal review of Bulger.
</P>
<P>
   Connolly went to work. By employing a variety of techniques, he
took raw nuggets of Bulger information and made them glitter. Like
the Medford robbery, he embellished Bulger's role in cracking other
cases. In addition, Connolly padded Bulger's file with information
that actually came from Flemmi. Recently, retired FBI supervisor
Robert Fitzpatrick testified that during this time another FBI
agent angrily accused Connolly of stealing material provided by his
informants and crediting Bulger with it. Connolly has denied that
claim, insisting he has done no wrong.
</P>
<P>
   But between late 1980 and early 1981, Connolly produced two
``justification memorandums'' that touted Bulger's value in
exaggerated terms; nearly every item Connolly cited was distorted
in Bulger's favor, according to a Globe review.
</P>
<P>
   The crown jewel of claims was attributing the FBI's successful
bugging of Mafia headquarters in the North End to Bulger and
Flemmi, an embellishment that was examined yesterday in Part 2. The
other claims run the gamut from the Medford bank heist to solving
murders and saving two agents' lives.
</P>
<P>
   In his Bulger memo of Dec. 2, 1980, Connolly credited Bulger
with breaking open a murder case four years earlier. Until Bulger
offered a helping hand, wrote Connolly, the FBI had had ``no
positive leads'' in the 1976 slaying of Joseph Barboza Baron in San
Francisco. Baron was gunned down Feb. 11, 1976, and three months
later, Connolly wrote, Bulger told him that a wise guy named Jimmy
Chalmas had set up Baron.
</P>
<P>
   By this time, however, Chalmas's possible role was old news.
Chalmas was a prime suspect from the start. Baron had been shot
outside his apartment, and homicide detectives had interrogated
Chalmas that night. Three months later, after the Bulger session,
the FBI confronted Chalmas, who had worked previously as an
informant; Chalmas agreed to resume that work. But from the moment
Baron died, Chalmas was a hot lead.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
A BIG HOLE IN THE PAPERWORK
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Next came perhaps the most intriguing of all the claims Connolly
has made in promoting Bulger _ the assertion that Bulger had saved
the lives of two FBI agents who'd worked undercover in two separate
cases in the late 1970s. News of a plot to kill a federal agent is
always alarming to law-enforcement officials. Twice, according to
Connolly's memo, Bulger had provided the FBI with a lifesaving
heads-up.
</P>
<P>
   But ample evidence exists to suggest that while Bulger may have
kept his ears open for possible trouble and may have passed along
warnings, the circumstances in these cases were not as dramatic as
Connolly later said. By the mid-1980s, even Connolly's new FBI
supervisor harbored doubts about the claims.
</P>
<P>
   From the start, there was a massive hole in Connolly's
record-keeping about these emotional events: At the time they
happened, he did not bother to document the vital information he
later credited Bulger with providing. Throughout his years as
Bulger's FBI handler, Connolly filed official reports, known as
``209-inserts,'' documenting fresh underworld intelligence from the
gangster _ tips ranging from important policy-making meetings to
the trivial, such as a change in the betting line used by bookies.
But, with agents' lives supposedly hanging in the balance, Connolly
did not write up 209-inserts outlining the help he would later say
proved so pivotal in protecting Nick Gianturco in 1978 and Billy
Butchka a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   To explain the omission, Connolly has since said he had no
reason to write up the tips, and that once he received them he
passed them along. But Morris, his former supervisor, testified
recently that documenting assistance of this type would have been
required as basic FBI procedure.
</P>
<P>
   Only at crunch time did Connolly start a written chronicle _ in
1980 when he was ordered to write a justification for keeping
Bulger allied with the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   In his memo, Connolly wrote that back in 1978, Bulger had
disclosed that a crew of truck hijackers from Charlestown ``was
thinking of taking Giarro out.'' This tip, wrote Connolly, enabled
the FBI to ``take steps to insure the safety of Special Agent
Nicholas D. Gianturco, aka Nick Giarro.''
</P>
<P>
   And back in 1977, continued Connolly, Bulger told him of a plan
to kill agent Butchka, who was posing as a buyer of stolen
paintings and jewelry from a burglary ring. Bulger, ``on his own,
was successful in preventing the prospective hit men from taking
any action against Butchka.''
</P>
<P>
   The two agents in question back up Connolly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will verify I was working undercover and that I did receive
a call that someone was going to hit me, and later I was told it
was attributed to one of John Connolly's informants,'' said
Butchka. ``This was basically all I knew about it.'' But he said he
could no longer recall the name of the agent who warned him or the
names of the thieves he was told were after him.
</P>
<P>
   In federal court recently, Gianturco testified that late one
night in October 1978, Connolly called him and persuaded him not to
meet with the truck hijackers. ``He said they were going to kill
me,'' Gianturco said. ``I was kind of glad that Mr. Bulger and Mr.
Flemmi were kind of watching out for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Over time, Connolly's retelling of these Bulger moments has
grown more inflated. In a follow-up memo, Connolly wrote that
Bulger had provided the information to protect FBI lives, ``at
great personal risk to source's life,'' a claim not documented in
any reports.
</P>
<P>
   ``They saved one of my friends' life,'' added Connolly in a
recent interview. ``You can't be around those guys for 15 years and
not like them. You had a common enemy.''
</P>
<P>
   But the lifesaving scenarios Connolly has described to bolster
Bulger's profile within the bureau are contradicted by key
officials who participated in each investigation. They do not
recall any specific death threats _ and to a person they said they
would not likely forget a plot to kill an agent. The plots, they
said, would have triggered internal alarms and would have been
documented at the time, not in a memo two years later.

NEXT UP: WHAT WILL STEVIE SAY? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MITCHELL ZUCKOFF  
 c.1997 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Stephen ``The Rifleman'' Flemmi has spent much of this
year slumped in a courtroom chair, his prison pallor growing more
ghostly by the day and his warmup suit wrinkling by the hour.
Hardly the picture of a robust gangster-in-chief.
</P>
<P>
   But Flemmi may well regain his vigor, and maybe even his
swagger, when he takes the witness stand next month to challenge
the 1995 racketeering charges against him, his fugitive partner,
James ``Whitey'' Bulger, reputed New England Mafia boss Francis
``Cadillac Frank'' Salemme, and other reputed mobsters.
</P>
<P>
   Flemmi's testimony will bring full circle the extraordinary US
District Court hearings that have kept law-enforcement authorities
and career criminals in anxious anticipation. The outcome of the
hearings will determine which side can more credibly claim to have
been in control all along, and which will return more swiftly to
business as usual.
</P>
<P>
   Flemmi's appearance is particularly significant because he
kick-started the pretrial process a year ago with a bombshell
affidavit claiming that he and Bulger were authorized by the FBI to
commit crimes in exchange for working as informants, and therefore
the charges against them should be dismissed.
</P>
<P>
   A key question about Flemmi's testimony is whether he will name
the FBI agent who allegedly tipped off him and Bulger in advance of
the 1995 indictment, giving them the ``head start'' they supposedly
expected in return for their years of service as informants.
</P>
<P>
   In exploring the claim that they were given approval by the FBI
to commit crimes, US District Judge Mark L. Wolf has made public
reams of once-secret FBI documents and has heard testimony from a
parade of former FBI agents, prosecutors, Drug Enforcement
Administration investigators, local police, and even former
Governor William Weld, a former US attorney for Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   Repeatedly, Wolf has been told that Bulger and Flemmi were never
formally immunized against prosecution; indeed, none of the
hundreds of documents produced to date spells out that defense
claim.
</P>
<P>
   But Wolf also has heard disgraced former FBI supervisor John
Morris testify about special treatment that snitches received,
including how Bulger and Flemmi were saved from a 1979 race-fixing
indictment and alerted to a 1988 gambling probe. Morris, testifying
under a grant of immunity, also said he told fellow FBI agent John
Connolly that an informant had implicated the pair in a murder. The
informant was soon killed. Connolly denies passing the word.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond Wolf's decision about whether to leave the case intact,
or strip it down, or throw it out entirely, there are other
unresolved matters.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, word surfaced that one of Bulger and Flemmi's alleged
coconspirators, John Martorano, has cut a deal with the government
under which he will testify against his former cohorts. So, even if
Wolf dismisses the current indictment, Bulger and Flemmi might find
themselves facing a new set of charges, possibly including murder.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Bulger remains a fixture on the State Police ``10
Most Wanted'' list, having eluded a manhunt since 1995 in the
company of his girlfriend, Catherine Greig. He is a somewhat lower
priority for the FBI, which has placed him on a list of roughly 120
fugitives who are a step below the 10 Most Wanted.
</P>
<P>
   There also is the uncertain future facing Connolly, now a Boston
Edison executive. He denies wrongdoing, but has refused to take the
stand without protection from prosecution. A federal prosecutor in
Hartford has begun looking at the case to determine if anyone at
the FBI broke the law by helping Bulger and Flemmi.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; The probe is being managed in Hartford because one of the
murders for which they have been implicated involved a Connecticut
jai-alai operation; also, given the close working relationship
between federal prosecutors and the Boston FBI, Justice Department
officials chose a neutral site.

THE TALK OF THE `TOWN' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MITCHELL ZUCKOFF  
 c.1997 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Throughout the 1980s, South Boston was thick with
snitches. And a surprising number were telling federal, state, and
local authorities the same tale: Despite pronouncements to the
contrary, James ``Whitey'' Bulger was at the financial epicenter of
drug dealing on his turf.
</P>
<P>
   FBI agents who were using Bulger as an informant generally
ignored or disputed the reports, perpetuating the myth that Bulger
was an underworld antidrug activist. After repeated failed attempts
to nab Bulger on drug-related charges, his 1995 indictment finally
pieced together his role in the drug-plagued ``Town.'' &UR;  &LR; Here are
some highlights:
</P>
<P>
   _In February 1981, a DEA informant known as ``C-1'' tells DEA
agent Steven Boeri that Bulger and his partner, Stephen ``The
Rifleman'' Flemmi, are muscling in on drug trafficking in
Massachusetts by demanding cash payments or a percentage of profits
from drug dealers.
</P>
<P>
   _In June 1983, Quincy Police Detective Richard E. Bergeron
reports that confidential sources say Bulger and Flemmi are
extorting drug dealers for money. One source says they are
arranging large drug deals and skimming the proceeds.
</P>
<P>
   _In January 1984, informant ``C-2'' tells DEA agent Albert
Reilly that Bulger allows cocaine and heroin to be distributed from
the Pit-Stop Bar on Claflin Street in South Boston in exchange for
protection money.
</P>
<P>
   _In October 1984, FBI agent Rod Kennedy tells DEA agents that
two confidential sources are talking about Bulger and Flemmi's drug
connections. One says every drug dealer in Boston _ except for two
who are exempt _ pays cash tribute to Bulger.
</P>
<P>
   _In August 1987 and June 1988, DEA informant ``C-1'' tells
authorities that ``Whitey Bulger gave the South Boston cocaine
business to George Hogan... as long as Bulger received his share of
profits from the business.'' Hogan is later indicted in a 1990 drug
sweep; he pleads guilty to one count.
</P>
<P>
   _In November 1987, convicted narcotics dealer Patrick Perkins
tells the DEA that Bulger arranged for ``the purchase of
multi-kilos of cocaine'' between Hollywood, Fla., and Boston.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; If there was one consistent voice disputing the informant
reports, it belonged to John Connolly, Bulger's FBI handler.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, an FBI agent from a different squad, James
Blackburn, testified recently that in the 1980s he asked Connolly
about reports that Bulger was shaking down a drug dealer named
Hobart Willis. Connolly's response? It wasn't true, Willis was
``crazy'' and wouldn't ``be worth the aggravation.'' And so,
Blackburn said, he didn't pursue the ``street talk.''

HOWIE WINTER NEVER SAW BULGER COMING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SHELLEY MURPHY  
 c.1997 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Howie Winter, who was replaced by Whitey Bulger as head
of the Winter Hill gang, says ``no way'' did he ever suspect that
Bulger was an FBI informant. And he's had 12 years in federal
prison to think about it _ all of it for two cases in which Bulger
has provided information to the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's still hard for me to believe,'' Winter said of recent
revelations about Bulger's double-dealing, speaking from the
federal penitentiary in Pennsylvania, where he's serving time for
dealing drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Winter's version of underworld events sharply contradicts that
of former FBI agent John J. Connolly, who convinced Bulger to turn
informant in the fall of 1975.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, according to Connolly, New England mob underboss
Gennaro ``Jerry'' Angiulo was on the verge of a war with the Winter
Hill gang to resolve a dispute over the placement of vending
machines around Greater Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Connolly said he warned Bulger that Angiulo would probably use
corrupt law-enforcement contacts to set up his Winter Hill rivals,
and suggested that Bulger use the FBI to turn the tables on
Angiulo.
</P>
<P>
   It was a deal Bulger accepted. Connolly says Bulger told him
that Winter and other high-ranking members of the gang blessed the
arrangement and considered him their ``liaison'' to the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   Winter burst out laughing at Connolly's claim, insisting it was
only last year, when the FBI acknowledged the ties, that he learned
Bulger and his partner, Stephen ``The Rifleman'' Flemmi, were
longtime FBI informants. Winter also said FBI reports by Connolly
alleging a turf battle between the Winter Hill gang and the Mafia
over vending machines were ``a fantasy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We weren't rivals, but we were not partners either,'' Winter
said. ``Jerry Angiulo always treated me and the people around me
very nice.''
</P>
<P>
   But Bulger and Flemmi did not. FBI reports unsealed in federal
court hearings in Boston reveal that the two men told the FBI about
the activities of Winter and other members of his gang.
</P>
<P>
   Now federal prosecutors have urged Winter, who has four years
left on a 10-year sentence, to cooperate with them against the
duplicitous gangsters. He said he has refused.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it was my worst enemy I wouldn't cooperate against them,''
Winter said. ``Myself, I think I'd rather take a cyanide pill than
go trap someone else to save my own ass.''
</P>
<P>
   Winter's friendship with Flemmi dates back to the early 1960s,
when they were both working for Somerville gang boss James
``Buddy'' McLean, who was gunned down in 1965 during the Irish gang
wars.
</P>
<P>
   Winter said he met Bulger in the 1970s, when Bulger enlisted his
help in resolving a bloody dispute between rival gangs in South
Boston. Bulger later began hanging around Winter Hill in
Somerville, eventually teaming up with Flemmi.
</P>
<P>
   Winter said he didn't socialize much with Bulger, but considered
Flemmi a good friend.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought the world of Stevie Flemmi,'' Winter said. ``He was
a man's man.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1979, federal prosecutors indicted 21 people _ including
Winter _ in a million-dollar horse-race-fixing scheme, but removed
Bulger and Flemmi from the case because they were informants.
Winter spent six years in prison.

CASES DISAPPEAR AS THE FBI LOOKS AWAY 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1997 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   (This Globe Spotlight Team series was prepared by editor Gerard
O'Neill and reporters Dick Lehr, Mitchell Zuckoff and Shelley
Murphy. This installment was written by Murphy.)
</P>
<P>
   BOSTON _ At the dawn of his deal with the FBI, Whitey Bulger was
an angry leg breaker at a Dedham restaurant looking to collect
money from an unpaid loan. Leaning across a table, he gave the
owner a choice: Pay, or Bulger would ``cut his ears off and stuff
them in his mouth.''
</P>
<P>
   Restaurateur Francis X. Green told his story to the FBI,
expecting protection and prosecution. But Bulger had an ace in the
hole. He worked for the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   Looking back, the 1976 incident at the Back Side Restaurant was
a turning point. An extortion case, built on a credible,
cooperative witness, might have stopped James J. Bulger and his
partner, Stephen ``The Rifleman'' Flemmi, from launching a 15-year
crime spree.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the FBI did nothing, sending a powerful message to two
of the region's most ruthless organized crime figures: As long as
you're with us, we won't bother you.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Bulger and Flemmi became sanctioned career
criminals while spying on the underworld for the FBI. Despite solid
evidence indicating Bulger and Flemmi were involved in murders,
shakedowns, and drug dealing, the FBI looked the other way
throughout the 1970s and 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   It made no difference who the victims were, fellow wise guys or
innocent people. And it didn't matter if the victims were willing
to cooperate with the FBI or were scared silent. In some cases, the
bureau even helped the gangsters by leaking information to them
about ongoing investigations.
</P>
<P>
   Recent court testimony shows the deflected cases ranged from the
momentous to the mundane, but the consistent thread running through
most of them is the involvement of Bulger's handler, former FBI
Special Agent John Connolly of South Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Some potential cases that went nowhere:
</P>
<P>
   _In 1982, a wise guy turned FBI informant was gunned down after
Connolly, according to testimony, told Bulger and Flemmi that the
man had implicated them in a string of gangland slayings and the
murder of an Oklahoma businessman.
</P>
<P>
   _In 1984, a Boston police detective told Connolly that Bulger
and Flemmi were trying to seize a liquor store owned by the
detective's relatives with a ``can't refuse'' offer. But Connolly
did not report the incident to superiors and, within days, Bulger
sent word to the victims that he knew they had complained to the
FBI and warned them to ``back off.''
</P>
<P>
   _In the late 1980s, FBI agents John Newton and Roderick Kennedy
failed to document or follow up on a realtor's claim that a
gun-toting Bulger threatened to stuff him in a body bag if the
realtor didn't pay him $50,000.
</P>
<P>
   _In 1988, another FBI agent, supervisor John Morris, who had
pocketed $7,000 in payoffs from Bulger, warned Bulger and Flemmi
that the FBI had tapped the telephone of a Roxbury bookmaker who
worked for them. While indictments resulted from the wiretap,
including some Boston policemen for taking payoffs, Bulger and
Flemmi went untouched.
</P>
<P>
   Although there is evidence that Connolly protected Bulger and
Flemmi, he was not alone. Supervisors and fellow agents often were
swayed by his claim there was insufficient evidence to target the
pair or that they were too valuable to the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   For example, FBI agent James Blackburn testified he never
pursued allegations that Bulger was shaking down a South Boston
drug dealer in 1988 after Connolly told him it wasn't true. And
agent James J. Lavin III testified that in 1987 he ignored evidence
that city workers erected guardrails on private property outside
the South Boston liquor store controlled by Bulger after Connolly
reminded him that Bulger was an indispensable informant.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Bulger and Flemmi were always suspects, but never
defendants; always informants, never targets.
</P>
<P>
   Last April, Connolly refused to testify at federal court
hearings exploring the FBI's controversial relationship with Bulger
and Flemmi, citing his Fifth Amendment right not to incriminate
himself. In interviews, he has accused other agents of lying when
they testified critically about his handling of Bulger and Flemmi.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not a rogue agent,'' Connolly said recently. ``Anything I
ever did, I did lawfully. I have no trouble with what I did. I did
it for the FBI, all the way to D.C. , constant oversight.''
</P>
<P>
   But the record now shows that the deal _ protection for
information _ left the bureau shortchanged, co-opted, and
compromised.
</P>
<P>
   In a telling aside during recent testimony, one of Connolly's
closest associates in the bureau, former agent Nicholas Gianturco,
talked about entertaining Bulger and Flemmi at his Peabody home.
``I felt comfortable having them to the house,'' he said. ``It was
not an adversarial relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
ALL TOGETHER IN ONE ROOM
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It was an improbable convergence of characters that put two of
the region's top prosecutors under the same roof in Dedham with
three gangsters while the hoodlums were extorting the owner of the
establishment across the room.
</P>
<P>
   In late 1976, then-Norfolk County District Attorney William
Delahunt had just ordered dinner at the Back Side Restaurant and
was awaiting the arrival of Martin Boudreau, a law school classmate
and federal prosecutor, when he looked up to see another old
acquaintance approaching his table.
</P>
<P>
   It was Johnny Martorano, a well-known gangster who had attended
grammar school with Delahunt in Quincy. Martorano and two other men
had just entered the restaurant. While his companions moved to a
cocktail table near the bar, Martorano chatted with Delahunt about
the different paths they had taken since their school days, joking
that there was more honor in his world than among bankers and
lawyers. Flemmi joined the conversation briefly.
</P>
<P>
   After Delahunt went back to his meal and was joined by Boudreau,
the number-two prosecutor in the Federal Organized Crime Strike
Force, the restaurant owner was summoned to sit with Bulger,
Flemmi, and Martorano to talk about a serious arrearage of
$175,000. According to later investigative reports, it was Bulger
who delivered the pay-or-die ultimatum.
</P>
<P>
   A few weeks later, Delahunt learned what really had brought his
old schoolmate to Dedham. Delahunt said Edward Harrington, former
chief of the New England Organized Crime Strike Force, called to
tell him that Bulger and his friends had threatened Green, the
restaurant owner, over an unpaid loan. And he said Green feared
Martorano had connections to Delahunt after seeing them banter that
night.
</P>
<P>
   After reassuring Harrington he had no ties to Martorano,
Delahunt said prosecutors assigned to his office interviewed Green
and later turned the case file over to the FBI. Green, who declined
to be interviewed by the Globe, is quoted in investigative reports
as saying Bulger and Flemmi threatened to kill him if he didn't
repay a loan from a Boston credit union.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's our money,'' Bulger told Green, threatening to
``positively kill him'' and mutilate his face, according to an FBI
report. Ears off, eyes out.
</P>
<P>
   FBI agents Thomas Daly and Peter Kennedy interviewed Green on
Oct. 13, 1977, and noted in their report that Flemmi told Green
that nobody would get hurt if he made arrangements with the woman
at the credit union who handled the loan. They wanted a $25,000
installment immediately.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent interview with the Globe, Rita Tobias of Belmont
confirmed that she loaned Green money through the finance company _
but said the amount was closer to $20,000. She insisted she doesn't
know Bulger or Flemmi and hadn't gone to them for help.
</P>
<P>
   The following year, Green became a star government witness, but
not against Bulger or his friends. Federal prosecutors used Green's
testimony in an unrelated public corruption case to win a
tax-evasion and bribery conviction against a Boston official.
Bulger and Flemmi went unpunished and unchallenged.
</P>
<P>
   Months after turning the Green case over to the FBI, Delahunt,
now a Massachusetts congressman, said he asked Jeremiah T.
O'Sullivan, chief of the New England Organized Crime Strike Force,
what became of the investigation and was told: ``It just didn't
work out.'' O'Sullivan's lawyer, Hugh Scott, declined comment on
the incident, saying it would be inappropriate because of the
ongoing federal hearings.
</P>
<P>
   Harrington, now a federal judge, was working as a lawyer for a
private law firm in Boston when Green reported his threatening
encounter with Bulger and Flemmi in 1976. The following year,
Harrington became US Attorney for Massachusetts, a job he held when
his public corruption squad used Green to make a case against the
Boston official.
</P>
<P>
   Today, when asked about his role in the Green case and why it
never led to charges against Bulger or Flemmi, Harrington said,
``In view of the fact that I am a federal judge and wish not to be
involved in a proceeding before another federal judge, I decline to
comment on the matter.''
</P>
<P>

BULGER IMPLICATED, MOBSTER KILLED
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Brian Halloran was a dead man. And the FBI knew it.
</P>
<P>
   Just a few days before Halloran was gunned down along the Boston
waterfront, an FBI official whispered to then-US Attorney William
F. Weld, ``I would not want to be standing next to this guy.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the FBI's decision to deny Halloran entry into its
witness protection program may have cost Halloran his life.

 BOSTON: ... his life.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Halloran was awaiting trial for the murder of a drug dealer in
January 1982 when he walked into the FBI's Boston office and
announced he wanted to cooperate against Bulger and Flemmi because
he feared they were trying to kill him.
</P>
<P>
   He offered to ``go all the way'' against the two, but wanted
immunity from prosecution and protection for himself and his
family, according to the FBI report. A member of the Winter Hill
gang who had frequent dealings with Bulger and Flemmi, Halloran
told a tale of murder and mayhem.
</P>
<P>
   For openers, he described how he dropped off South Boston
bookmaker Louis Litif at Triple O's tavern on April 12, 1980, for
an after-hours meeting with Bulger. Moments later, Halloran said,
he watched as Bulger and an associate lugged Litif's
plastic-wrapped body out the back door of the South Boston bar and
dumped it into the trunk of Litif's new Lincoln. The car and the
body were later found in the South End.
</P>
<P>
   Then Halloran moved on to another bloody murder scene, this one
in Oklahoma. He claimed he could help solve the shooting death of
millionaire Roger Wheeler, the Telex Corp. chairman who was shot to
death on May 27, 1981, outside an exclusive Tulsa country club.
</P>
<P>
   Wheeler had bought World Jai Alai (WJA) three years earlier and
suspected Somerville's Winter Hill gang of skimming profits from
the company's operation in Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   Halloran claimed that his friend, John Callahan, former
president of WJA, summoned him to a meeting with Bulger and Flemmi
in January 1981 at Callahan's Boston waterfront apartment.
</P>
<P>
   Halloran said Callahan asked him to murder Wheeler, who
suspected that employees who remained loyal to Callahan were doing
the skimming. Later, Halloran said, Callahan told him he wasn't
needed and the murder was carried out by Bulger, Flemmi, and John
Martorano.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the significance of Halloran's account, authorities in
Oklahoma say the FBI in Boston never shared it with them.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, FBI agent Morris &UR;  &LR; said he passed along word to Connolly
that Halloran was cooperating with another squad in the FBI against
his two prized informants.
</P>
<P>
   Morris testified that Connolly then told Bulger and Flemmi that
Halloran had implicated them in Wheeler's murder, prompting
Connolly to file an informant report from Bulger arguing that
``there was no way that they would have been involved with Halloran
in connection with anything, let alone murder.''
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, the FBI, along with Strike Force Chief O'Sullivan,
concluded that Halloran was unreliable and turned him away from an
FBI safe house on Cape Cod.
</P>
<P>
   Weeks later, on May 11, 1982, Halloran was gunned down as he
left a bar on Northern Avenue in South Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Callahan, being sought for questioning as a potential witness in
the Halloran and Wheeler slayings, was found murdered three months
later in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; In a recent interview, Connolly said he ``absolutely never''
told Bulger and Flemmi that Halloran had turned FBI informant
against them before he was killed. Connolly said he filed reports
before Halloran's death noting that Bulger claimed the Mafia was
going to kill Halloran.
</P>
<P>
   The fallout from the investigation spread within the FBI, as
agents in Oklahoma City and Miami accused the Boston office of
stonewalling about Wheeler and Halloran.
</P>
<P>
   The distrust spilled over into the Boston office, as the agent
assigned to the Wheeler case accused Connolly of ``rifling'' his
file and leaking information to Bulger and Flemmi that would help
them establish alibis. Connolly vehemently denies the charge.
</P>
<P>
   At first, Connolly refused to call in Bulger and Flemmi to have
them photographed so investigators in Oklahoma could show their
pictures to potential witnesses. According to recent testimony by
James Ring, who was then supervisor of the organized-crime squad,
Connolly became ``defensive'' about the photo request, arguing that
Bulger and Flemmi had proclaimed their innocence. Connolly relented
only after Ring threatened to drop Bulger and Flemmi as informants.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the FBI didn't force Bulger and Flemmi to take polygraph
examinations after they refused. In contrast, Halloran was dropped
as an informant when he refused to take the lie detector test.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a long time we thought, it's just pure incompetence,''
said Wheeler's son, David, who now believes the FBI has obstructed
the investigation into his father's murder. ``But I never dreamed
it was as extensive as it is.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
WHITEY AND STEVIE GO SHOPPING
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It was Christmas time 1983 and Whitey Bulger and Stevie Flemmi
were out shopping. They were cruis &UR; cy5 &LR; ing around South Boston when
they saw something they wanted: a newly renovated liquor store on
the site of what had until recently been an abandoned gas station.
</P>
<P>
   It meant nothing to Bulger and Flemmi that Stephen and Julie
Rakes didn't want to sell Stippo's Liquor Mart on Old Colony
Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   During a menacing visit to the Rakes's South Boston home during
the first week of the new year, Bulger and Flemmi handed Stephen
Rakes a bag stuffed with $67,000 cash and announced they were
buying the liquor store, according to testimony.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want to sell it,'' said Rakes, who was home with his
two young daughters while his wife was working at the store.
</P>
<P>
   Flemmi allegedly sat down at the kitchen table, pulled one of
Rakes's blond-haired daughters onto his lap, and set a gun on the
table in front of her. The curious toddler picked up the gun and
playfully sucked on the handle, according to federal grand jury
testimony revealed in court.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be a shame not to see your children grow up,'' Bulger
allegedly said.
</P>
<P>
   A horrified Rakes called his wife at the store and told her to
pack up all their belongings and come home.
</P>
<P>
   Within days, then-Boston Police Detective Joseph Lundbohm said
he went to Connolly on behalf of his niece, Julie Rakes, unaware
that Bulger and Flemmi were informants and Connolly was their
handler.
</P>
<P>
   Connolly said he took no action to stop the hostile takeover by
Bulger and Flemmi because the couple ``did not want to get wired up
and they did not want to be witnesses. How do you make a case like
that?''
</P>
<P>
   It was a chilling lesson for the Rakeses, who discovered a few
days later that Bulger knew they had complained to the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whitey said to back off,'' Stephen Rakes told Lundbohm, who
said he suspected Connolly tipped Bulger about their meeting. In a
Globe interview, Connolly denied leaking the information.
</P>
<P>
   Connolly said he couldn't recall whether he reported the
incident to his supervisor, but federal prosecutors said a search
of FBI files failed to uncover any paperwork on it. It appears
Connolly made a unilateral decision to neither investigate the
extortion nor pass it along to a supervisor.
</P>
<P>
   The store was sold to Bulger's friend, Kevin Weeks _ at least on
paper _ without a hitch and was renamed the South Boston Liquor
Mart. It immediately became a new hangout for Bulger and Flemmi.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, the FBI was patronizing Bulger's store. A 1990 raid of the
Liquor Mart by the Drug Enforcement Administration, the Suffolk
County Organized Crime Squad, and the IRS uncovered a receipt
indicating the FBI bought liquor at discount prices to give away at
its annual Christmas party months earlier.
</P>
<P>
   The receipt indicated that the liquor was purchased by agent
Dick Baker, the party organizer. And a separate piece of notebook
paper indicated who the agent was: ``Dick Baker (friend of John
Connolly).'' Connolly does not deny the FBI bought liquor at the
store but says the piece of paper with his name on it was planted.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
NO FBI FOLLOWUP TO EXTORTION
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Years after Louis Litif was allegedly murdered in Triple O's,
Bulger and his friends summoned an unsuspecting businessman to a
meeting in the Broadway tavern, according to court documents and
recent testimony.
</P>
<P>
   ``Someone hired me to kill you,'' Bulger told South Boston
realtor Raymond Slinger, after calling him to a meeting in an
upstairs apartment in the late 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Bulger, accompanied by his friends Kevin Weeks and Kevin O'Neil,
said he was willing to spare Slinger's life in exchange for cold
cash. But, when Slinger had the audacity to arrive at a follow-up
meeting with the trio packing a gun, he was beaten and kicked as an
enraged Bulger ordered his friends to ``go downstairs and get a
body bag.''
</P>
<P>
   After Bulger's demand increased to $50,000, Slinger reported the
extortion to the FBI. Agent John Newton testified that the FBI had
``a great case'' against Bulger because Slinger was willing to wear
a wire and testify.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the FBI took no action.
</P>
<P>
   Days later, O'Neil told Slinger that he'd only have to pay
$25,000, but ``there wasn't going to be any FBI investigation,''
according to testimony in the federal court hearings.
</P>
<P>
   Newton's supervisor, Bruce Ellavsky, testified that the FBI
dropped the case because the extortion stopped and Slinger no
longer wanted to go forward.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, Ellavsky couldn't explain why there were no FBI reports on
the incident.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
------ &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There was no mystery about why Bulger and Flemmi never got
caught up in an FBI investigation in the late 1980s of a Roxbury
bookie who was paying them ``rent'' and dealing extensively with
them. The pair were warned to stay away by agent John Morris
because a wiretap was going into John Baharoian's office.
</P>
<P>
   Morris, who had taken three bribes from Bulger, was concerned
that the pair could give him up if they were caught and indicted.
</P>
<P>
   But he also testified he was tired of the hold Bulger and Flemmi
had on him and the relentless expansion of their criminal network.
And he wanted no more blood on his hands. Leave Baharoian alone,
the former organized-crime supervisor told them. ``I don't want any
more Hallorans.''

 BOSTON: ... two years later.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Moreover, hard evidence of a murder plot could have been raised
against the defendants charged in the truck hijacking and burglary
ring during a bail hearing or, upon conviction, at sentencing, if
not pursued outright as a charge. But none of that, they said,
occurred in either case.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't remember him (Butchka) ever being threatened,'' said
Michael Collora, the former federal prosecutor who oversaw
prosecution of the burglary ring infiltrated by Butchka. Collora,
now in private practice and representing Morris, the former
supervisor, added in a recent interview: ``I would have known about
any threat because we would've had to make a decision whether to
pull him off, and that was never done.''
</P>
<P>
   Likewise in the truck-hijacking case, which was run jointly by
the FBI and the State Police, the FBI's own internal reports _
monthly ``airtells'' that updated higher-ups on the case's progress
_ made no mention of any alarm over Gianturco's safety.
</P>
<P>
   ``I absolutely never heard of it,'' said Robert Long, a retired
State Police official who had coordinated the probe. ``Nor did the
colonel of the State Police overseeing the operation hear about it.
Nor did any of the troopers permanently assigned to the project.
Nor did my counterpart in the FBI.''
</P>
<P>
   If a hijacker was planning to kill an agent, continued Long,
``wouldn't you want to monitor the suspect's movements? Because if
he didn't succeed that day, there would be another day, another
time, and he'd keep trying.''
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, even one of Connolly's FBI supervisors voiced
skepticism about Connolly's lifesaving claims. Retired agent James
A. Ring testified in June that after taking over the
organized-crime squad in 1983 he began to assess Bulger and ``Mr.
Connolly was saying to me _ discussing the value of Mr. Bulger and
Mr. Flemmi _ that they had saved Nickie Gianturco's life.'' Soon
after, said Ring, he sought out Gianturco.
</P>
<P>
   ``I asked him what was the story?'' testified Ring. Gianturco,
said Ring, described the case and how he'd gotten a ``warning''
from Connolly not to go to a meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Testified Ring: ``I think what I was saying to him was: `You
didn't answer my question. My question was: Are you reporting to me
that you believe that these two people saved your life? And I'm not
sure that I can sit here and say that I ever got an answer. It's a
matter of intrepretation.''
</P>
<P>
   But in a crucial 1980 FBI memo, Connolly said it did happen,
citing the foiled assassination attempts in a menu of Bulger
accomplishments he argued justified sticking with the crime boss.
Last spring, Morris, while rejecting the notion that Connolly's
reports contained lies, did concede, ``We were trying to put them
(Bulger and Flemmi) in their best light.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, this early crisis passed. Bulger was kept on.
Throughout the 1980s, other challenges arose. There were even times
when Bulger was closed down for a spell. But Connolly was able to
fight off the critics and remain the annointed chronicler of Bulger
for the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
A KNACK FOR STORYTELLING
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Besides his special memos, Connolly had a knack for embellishing
Bulger's doings in routine FBI filings, sometimes at the expense of
Flemmi.
</P>
<P>
   Occasionally, Connolly filed duplicate reports for each _
attributing the same information in the exact same words to both
Bulger and Flemmi. The only difference between the two reports was
the typewriter used to write them. At other times the wording
wasn't exactly the same, but the information was, and both would
get credit.
</P>
<P>
   To explain the overlap, Connolly has said he wasn't especially
careful about how he kept the books, given that he considered them
one source. ``Oftentimes they blurred,'' Connolly said in an
interview about his late-night rendezvous with the pair of
gangsters. ``The information almost came as one.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, at key moments Connolly favored Bulger. In early 1981,
for example, Connolly apparently manipulated a tip about the
Mafia's interest in a businessman named Harvey Cohen. Initially, he
wrote up similarly-worded reports for Bulger and Flemmi: That on
March 13, 1981, each provided information that Cohen might have a
``serious problem'' with the mob. Flemmi's report was slightly more
detailed; besides identifying Cohen, the report cited the name of
Cohen's trucking company in East Boston.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI bug that was in operation during the early part of 1981
soon picked up Mafia leader Ilario Zannino referring to Cohen.
``This Harvey Cohen, I'm going to kill him,'' grumbled Zannino to a
soldier in the early morning of April 3, 1981.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI then warned Cohen before the Mafia was able to act.
</P>
<P>
   For a handler of informants like Connolly, this was a high-five
moment. Tips about the Mafia on the verge of violence are highly
valued by the FBI. But in a second justification memo, Connolly
singled out Bulger for glory, not Flemmi. The Cohen matter had
erupted at a time when Connolly had been ordered to justify his
ties to the controversial Bulger, and in the second memo he
stressed Bulger had ``advised that the Mafia is going to kill a
Jewish guy named Cohen.'' In a memo he filed for Flemmi, Connolly
did not mention Cohen at all.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Flemmi himself drew attention to the Connolly
practice of giving Bulger credit for information that had come from
him. In a sworn affidavit, he noted that in 1984 he'd given
Connolly a tip about an underworld figured named Robert Daddieco.
However, wrote Flemmi, Connolly later ``apparently recorded the
essence of it in an insert to the Bulger informant file, but not in
mine.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, a number of organized-crime investigators and attorneys
who have examined Connolly's once-secret files have concluded that
Flemmi was actually the more valuable informant to the FBI. Between
the two, Flemmi was the one with long, personal ties to Zannino and
the Mafia. Over the years, Zannino, Raymond Patriarca, and other
Mafia leaders repeatedly tried to persuade Flemmi to join La Cosa
Nostra. Flemmi, not Bulger, had the juice, and was the frequent
visitor inside Mafia offices. Over the years Flemmi, not Bulger,
drew up diagrams of various Mafia meeting places, providing
Connolly with a floor plan and pointing out where each Mafiosi sat.
</P>
<P>
   ``No question,'' said one of the attorneys about Flemmi's
superior value to Bulger. Others go so far as to wonder why the FBI
ever needed Bulger, since the once-secret bureau files also reveal
Flemmi was already on board and had been working on-and-off as an
informant since the mid-1960s.
</P>
<P>
   To date, Connolly has invoked his Fifth Amendment privilege
rather than testify about his dealings with Bulger and Flemmi. In
interviews, he defended his work, saying he's done no wrong and
broken no laws.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Connolly angrily accused the government of betraying
him and breaking a promise to Bulger and Flemmi never to disclose
that they were informants.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact they were stone killers and major gangsters has
nothing to do with the government's word,'' Connolly said. ``Those
were the people the government chose to go into business with.
Those were the people the government benefited from, so the very
least they could do is keep their goddamned word.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
A LAST HURRAH FOR BULGER HYPE
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, even John Morris, the corrupted FBI supervisor, had
had enough. Jumping off the Bulger bandwagon in the late 1980s, he
advised the FBI to cut Bulger loose. But Connolly now had a new
champion in the office, the special agent in charge of Boston from
1986 to 1989, James Ahearn.
</P>
<P>
   Not long after his arrival, Ahearn ordered a deputy to review
Bulger's status. In hindsight, the outcome _ to keep Bulger _ was
hardly a surprise. In recent testimony, an FBI official said the
review consisted largely of looking at Connolly's files and talking
to Connolly himself. Connolly, said the FBI official, believed that
Bulger ``absolutely should remain'' an informant.
</P>
<P>
   The high-water mark in the FBI's peculiar view of Bulger came in
1989, the culmination of more than a decade of often skewed
paperwork.
</P>
<P>
   In a secret memo to the FBI director, Ahearn heaped praise on
Connolly and his prized informant. Bulger, he wrote, was ``regarded
as the most important Organized Crime informant for many years.''
The memo did not even mention Flemmi by name.
</P>
<P>
   This was a last hurrah of sorts in Bulger hype.
</P>
<P>
   That same year Flemmi _ not Bulger _ was the informant who
proved indispensable in an FBI coup: the first-ever bugging of an
actual Mafia induction ceremony in Medford. Just as Bulger was
being called the FBI's most valuable Mafia informant, the
previously secret FBI files now show Bulger had little to no role
in the history-making bugging operation.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the agent assembling the probable cause required to win
court approval for a bug relied extensively upon Flemmi's FBI
informant reports. To be sure, Bulger's reports could have been
utilized since Connolly, as was long his style, had prepared
reports for Bulger that were mirror images of Flemmi's. But at
crunch time, the FBI turned to Flemmi as the informant more
credible about the Mafia.
</P>
<P>
   The worm was turning in Boston for Bulger and the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   In 1988, the Globe disclosed for the first time Bulger's
relationship with the FBI _ which top agent Ahearn said for the
record was ``absolutely untrue.'' Soon Connolly himself was
preparing to leave the FBI and take a top job at Boston Edison.
Before he left, he filed a report suggesting his two informants
were calling it a day _ ``packing it in and going into various
legitimate businesses that they own.'' Flemmi, for one, had used
cash to buy up a slew of real estate in Boston's Back Bay.
</P>
<P>
   But what Connolly considered retirement, federal prosecutors saw
as money laundering. By 1990, a new team had taken over, headed by
Fred Wyshak, an aggressive assistant US attorney.
</P>
<P>
   Just a year after Ahearn's remark about how prized an asset
Bulger was, Bulger and Flemmi were closed down for good.
</P>
<P>
   Before the curtain fell, the FBI finally called a halt to
Connolly's home visits. By the late 1980s, testified former
supervisor Ring, Connolly was ordered to stop playing host to the
two informants at his and other agents' homes.
</P>
<P>
   ``My whole thought was this is just stupid,'' said Ring. The
longrunning practice, he had concluded, was ``unprofessional.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not the way business is done by FBI agents.''

SIDEKICK'S DOUBLE-DEALING CAREER WORTHY OF A MASTER SPY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SHELLEY MURPHY  
 c.1997 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Stephen ``The Rifleman'' Flemmi has always been the
sidekick, the guy with the colorful nickname barely mentioned in
organized-crime stories that kept the spotlight on his notorious
partner, Whitey Bulger.
</P>
<P>
   But in many ways, the soft-spoken Flemmi was the main man while
he operated in the shadows.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Bulger turned FBI informant in 1975, Flemmi had
already been talking to the bureau for a decade.
</P>
<P>
   In just one example of how he juggled conflicting interests,
Flemmi tipped off the FBI about the permanent disappearance of a
gangster during the 1960s gang wars. Later, he was charged with
murdering the man, a case for which he has yet to stand trial.
</P>
<P>
   When Bulger and Flemmi teamed up in 1974 as enforcers for
Somerville's Winter Hill gang, it was Flemmi who was the feared
killer in the underworld.
</P>
<P>
   And it was Flemmi who first straddled both gangster camps _ the
Italians in the North End and the Irish in Somerville. He so
ingratiated himself with Mafiosi like Raymond Patriarca in
Providence and Ilario Zannino in Boston that they courted him to
become a Mafia soldier.
</P>
<P>
   Even Winter Hill gang leader Howie Winter admits he was fonder
of the fun-loving Flemmi than of the antisocial Bulger.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought the world of Stevie Flemmi,'' said Winter during a
telephone interview from prison. ``He was a man's man.''
</P>
<P>
   Flemmi's long career has been a story worthy of a master spy _
liked by many, but known by few.
</P>
<P>
   A former paratrooper who served in Korea, he forged friendships
around the country with veterans who had no idea he was a gangster.
He had a cadre of wise guy friends who didn't know he was an
informant _ one who was actually informing on them. And he
socialized with FBI agents, who said they trusted him with their
lives, despite his reputation as a killer.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a fun guy to be around and he was a real gentleman,''
said Winter's wife, Ellen Brogna, of Millbury. ``Stevie would do
anything to help you.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, when Winter went away to prison in 1979 on race-fixing
charges and again in 1992 on drug charges, a sympathetic Flemmi
would call Brogna to make sure she was OK, or to take her out to
dinner.
</P>
<P>
   But at the same time he was consoling Winter's wife, Flemmi was
leaking information to the FBI about Winter's activities, according
to FBI reports.
</P>
<P>
   ``He never represented himself as having an evil side,'' Brogna
said. ``I always saw one side of him, the kindness he showed to
me.''
</P>
<P>
   The revelation last year that Flemmi moonlighted as an FBI
informant for 30 years was initially greeted with disbelief by
Flemmi's underworld friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the most difficult thing to believe,'' said Brogna. She
said she recently wrote to Flemmi in jail, where he is awaiting
trial on racketeering charges, urging him to call her. And he did.
</P>
<P>
   Despite stacks of FBI documents indicating he snitched on his
friends, Brogna said Flemmi assured her ``things aren't what they
appear.''
</P>
<P>
   Flemmi was born June 9, 1934, the first child of Italian
immigrants, Giovanni and Mary Flemmi, who raised three sons in the
Orchard Park housing project in Roxbury. His father worked as a
bricklayer.
</P>
<P>
   Flemmi's childhood friends included Frank Salemme, still the
reputed leader of the New England Mafia, who sits in a jail cell
awaiting trial in the same racketeering case as Flemmi.
</P>
<P>
   After being arrested at age 15 on a charge of ``carnal abuse,''
and spending some time at a juvenile detention facility for
assault, Flemmi enlisted in the Army at age 17, serving two tours
in Korea with the 187th Airborne Regimental Combat Team. He was
highly decorated when honorably discharged in 1955. Like other
soldiers in his squad, Flemmi was dubbed ``a rifleman.'' But unlike
the others, he took the nickname home with him.
</P>
<P>
   Although short _ 5-foot-8 _ and slender, Flemmi had a reputation
as a tough guy who wouldn't hesitate to shoot.
</P>
<P>
   When rival gangs from Somerville and Charlestown started killing
each other in the 1960s, FBI Special Agent H. Paul Rico recruited
Flemmi as an informant. His code name was ``Jack from South
Boston'' in the early days. Later, the FBI referred to him as
``Shogun.'' He was deemed an underworld comer by Rico, ``if he
survives the gang war.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Although he was being wooed by mob capo Zannino in 1967 to join
the Mafia, Flemmi confided to Rico he ``does not like the
individuals as men, but it is possible that he will join it as
Salemme is impressed with these people and Salemme, after all, is
his partner.''
</P>
<P>
   But Flemmi's partnership with Salemme was about to end. In 1969,
they were charged with planting a car bomb that tore off Attorney
John E. Fitzgerald's leg and nearly killed him. The motive for the
January 1968 attack was that Fitzgerald was representing a
notorious hit-man-turned-informant who was testifying against the
local mob hierarchy.
</P>
<P>
   Both men went on the lam, but only Salemme was captured and
convicted of the Fitzgerald bombing. He spent 15 years in prison.
Flemmi surrendered in 1974 after a witness recanted and all charges
against him were dropped. Last year, Flemmi revealed that Rico
alerted him it was safe to return to Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``He hooked up with Whitey and they did well together,'' Salemme
confided about Flemmi to a fellow Mafiosi during a bugged
conversation at the Logan Hilton in December 1991.
</P>
<P>
   For Flemmi, life had never been better. As partners, Flemmi and
Bulger expanded their criminal enterprise while running from
meetings with wise guys to dinners with FBI agents.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1990s, Flemmi began investing in real estate, buying up
property in Boston's Back Bay. And he soon expanded his social
circle, joining veterans groups and raising money for Korean War
memorials.
</P>
<P>
   James W. Lang, a retired winery worker from British Columbia,
who served in the same company with Flemmi in Korea, was shocked to
learn Flemmi is charged with murder, loansharking, and extortion as
part of a federal racketeering indictment.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a very mild person,'' Lang said. ``He doesn't really get
excited, but when he says something, he means it. I've never seen
anyone so sincere.''
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-five years after Flemmi and Lang helped rescue a wounded
soldier during a bloody battle with Chinese soldiers in the Kumwha
Valley in Korea, they renewed their friendship at a paratrooper
reunion in Norfolk, Va.
</P>
<P>
   At Lang's urging, Flemmi joined the International Association of
Airborne Veterans and traveled the world jumping out of planes with
active paratroopers from various countries in a show of good will.
In 1989, Flemmi jumped in South Africa, the following year he
jumped in East Germany and Thailand, and in 1991, Israel. He
fraternized with generals, sometimes sending them small gifts after
returning home.
</P>
<P>
   When Lang couldn't afford the South African trip, Flemmi gave
him $1,000. Flemmi also donated $5,000 in 1993 to a Korean War
Memorial in Charlestown, where his name is inscribed on a granite
bench reading, ``In memory of the paratroopers who made the supreme
sacrifice on the battlefields of Korea.''
</P>
<P>
   Lang, who thought Flemmi earned his living as a liquor store
owner, added: ``Steve is just a terrific humanitarian.''

   TAKE-BOS  
 BOSTON: ... didn't have.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   That knowledge was supplied to the FBI largely by a Suffolk
County bookie, an inconspicuous man who did most of the damage to
the Angiulo crime network. The bookie had hard-earned intelligence
about how gambling money was delivered and where it was kept. And
that's what paved the way for the devastating electronic
surveillance at 98 Prince St.
</P>
<P>
   A longtime informant for Morris, the bookie also knew the math
behind the odds and payouts. He was in and out of 98 Prince St.
often, observing the weekly coordination of the betting business.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, he was the classic informant with the usual motive _
revenge. And, he was the antithesis of Bulger _ a nonviolent snitch
who had no interest in expanding his modest crime base in exchange
for well-received FBI informant reports.
</P>
<P>
   In a Globe interview several years ago, the bookie, speaking on
condition he not be identified, said he hated Angiulo for his greed
and crude ways, his lack of loyalty to the real money men _ the
bookmakers. He said he was nostalgic about older Mafia leaders he
had worked with because they had ``a live and let live (attitude)
as long as they got what they got.'' Not so with the Angiulo
regime: ``They take your money. They take everything from you.''
</P>
<P>
   The bookie's help is what allowed six agents to enter Angiulo's
office in the early hours one night in January 1981. They planted
two microphones at the top of the walls and put log-sized battery
packs above the ceiling. For four months, the bugs transmitted
incriminating mob talk to a Charlestown apartment where tapes
rolled as agents monitored the conversations.
</P>
<P>
   Before it was over, 23 mobsters would be convicted in the fall
of the house of Angiulo: three brothers convicted of racketeering;
their lawyer for obstruction of justice; henchmen and runners for
gambling.
</P>
<P>
   If there was any doubt about the preeminent value of the
bookie's information in bringing down Angiulo, it was removed in
1984. That was the year the bookie was given a presidential pardon
on gambling crimes _ with the support of top federal officials,
including Bulger-booster O'Sullivan, who praised the bookie's
critical contribution.
</P>
<P>
   Even Morris _ who admitted taking $7,000 in bribes from Bulger _
now concedes to inflating Bulger and Flemmi's value in the Angiulo
case. When he testified at an extraordinary federal hearing on
possible FBI misconduct in April, Morris said Bulger and Flemmi
were helpful, but not necessary, in obtaining court approval for
the Prince Street bugs and that his organized-crime squad could
have done the job without them.
</P>
<P>
   So why include them? ``They had provided some information of
value, and I wanted to make sure they got credit,'' Morris
testified. But there was another, less altruistic reason.
</P>
<P>
   Including Bulger would help Connolly's career. Once Bulger's
information was added to the affidavit, Morris said he rewarded
Connolly with a meritorious ``stat'' for his file in an
organization obsessed with developing informants and known for
keeping close tabs _ and giving bonuses _ on ``CIs'' in wiretap
affidavits.
</P>
<P>
   But even after the microphones went into the walls at 98 Prince
St., the issue lingered within the FBI, to say nothing of the State
Police: Had someone tipped Bulger about Lancaster Street?
</P>
<P>
   That contretemps was finally put to rest with a long
``justification'' memo from Morris and Connolly in April 1981 that
recited a litany of matters on which Bulger purportedly provided
vital information, chief among them the highly productive Angiulo
bugs.
</P>
<P>
   In the same memo defending Bulger's continued use as an
informant, Morris went a step further, making a claim that was
bogus at best. He proclaimed the death of Bulger's Winter Hill
gang, saying it had been devastated by a series of prosecutions and
was no longer ``a significant criminal enterprise.'' And so, it
``does not merit further targeting at this time or any time in the
foreseeable future,'' he wrote. In short, a pass from the FBI's top
organized-crime agent.
</P>
<P>
   But on the contrary, the Winter Hill gang, in the persons of
Bulger and Flemmi, was alive and well.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1980s, aided by the Mafia takedown, Bulger was able
to steadily expand his criminal network. In fact, the elimination
of the Angiulos allowed Bulger and Flemmi to change the way they
did business. The pair were able to mimic the Mafia itself,
shifting from running a gambling and loan-sharking operation on the
periphery to extorting monthly ``rents'' from a host of bookies and
drug dealers. Just like Angiulo.
</P>
<P>
   Bulger pulled back a safer distance from the front lines and
skimmed off the top, letting others take the risks of collecting
debts and selling dope.
</P>
<P>
   And his expansion was abetted by federal investigations of
Bulger associates. An extensive review of bureau documents filed in
federal court shows Bulger's specialty was informing on his rivals
within the Winter Hill mob. Memos on his information _ called
``209-inserts'' _ deal with where to find fugitive Tommy Nee in
South Boston, John Martorano in Florida, and Joe McDonald, on his
way with IRA guns to New York, where he was arrested with his cache
as he got off a train.
</P>
<P>
   As for Mafia doings, Bulger served up mostly minutiae about who
was mad at whom over money. He would whisper tidbits to Connolly:
Sonny Mercurio hates Jerry Angiulo; Johnny Cincotti rubs people the
wrong way at Winter Hill card games; Skinny Kazonis drives a white
Ford; Bobby Carrozza is back in town.
</P>
<P>
   But over the past 20 years, trouble frequently followed the
friends of Whitey Bulger in the wake of his informant files. One by
one, his closest underworld associates in the Winter Hill gang
landed in jail for years. Howie Winter, the gang's leader, was
jailed in 1979 for race fixing, and again in 1992 for selling
cocaine. Pat Nee was busted for gun smuggling and Joe Murray for
marijuana smuggling in 1987. Jimmy Sims and Joe McDonald went away
for race fixing and other crimes in 1983. All were prominent
entries in Connolly's snitch reports from Bulger.
</P>
<P>
   After the arrest of the Angiulo brothers in 1983 and the
imprisonment of top Winter Hill figures, it was clear sailing for
Bulger as he and Flemmi filled the power vacuum.
</P>
<P>
   After a while, even Morris realized it. ``The more we worked on
the Mafia,'' he testified, ``the less the threat the Mafia was to
them.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   FACTIONS FORGE FRAGILE ALLIANCE
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But because the Mafia always had the upper hand in manpower and
money, Bulger's Irish gang was more a wary partner than a foe of
the Italians in Boston during the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Largely through Flemmi's connections, the two factions had
worked out a fragile alliance in which gambling, loan-sharking, and
drug territory were bold bright lines on the underworld map. Debts
were to be honored, turf respected, encroachments arbitrated.
</P>
<P>
   Because State Police saw the joint enterprise in action in early
1980, it kept pursuing Bulger and Flemmi in the face of
increasingly strained relations with the FBI. But the investigators
went forward not knowing that the federal agency had decided to
retain Bulger as a prime informant and confine its organized crime
work to Angiulo's North End office.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, both agencies were working simultaneously but
independently in the North End, with State Police tracking Bulger
and Flemmi in their black Chevy Caprice and FBI agents using
surveillance cars on Prince Street with video cameras hidden in the
grille work. At times, there was the possibility that agents and
troopers would crash into each other on Hanover Street.
</P>
<P>
   But the State Police were seeing what the FBI was denying _
Bulger and Flemmi working hand-in-glove with lower-level Mafia
figures in a joint venture, starting their nocturnal workdays
between 1 and 4 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   They watched mobster Ilario Zannino pull up to the Lancaster
Street garage in a blue Lincoln, get out and kiss Bulger on the
cheek, in the old-world greeting of friendship. They watched East
Boston mob associate Nick Femia drive Bulger around and do business
with him in the back seat of a car outside Giro's Restaurant. They
listened to several informants tell them that the garage was a
front for a bank where ``big boys'' go to deliver money from
illegal gaming operations, a place where accounts were settled with
Bulger on Tuesdays.
</P>
<P>
   And they watched the evidence mount that Bulger and Flemmi were
dipping into the drug trade as major mob dealers such as Michael
Caruana and Frank Lepere and Kevin Dailey showed up at the garage,
sometimes with briefcases.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the State Police watched Bulger move his Winter Hill
``office'' from Lancaster Street after the blowup within law
enforcement over leaks, first to a bank of pay phones off the
Southeast Expressway and then back to the North End, working out of
a car in a space in front of Giro's.
</P>
<P>
   The State Police surveillance started in April 1980 and ended in
March 1981 with investigators finally abandoning efforts to get a
bug into the black Chevy being used as Bulger's office.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, one of the hat-in-hand visitors to Lancaster Street
was renowned bookie Burton ``Chico'' Krantz, the first of the major
``independent'' bookmakers coerced into paying Bulger monthly
``rent'' to stay in business in 1979. A high roller, Krantz trekked
to the garage to pay Bulger a special mediation fee of $5,000 for
Bulger's settling of a financial dispute between Krantz and another
bookie, according to court records.
</P>
<P>
   Largely because of persistent work by State Police detectives,
Krantz is now in the witness-protection program, a key witness
against Bulger in the multi-faceted racketeering case that began to
emerge during the State Police surveillance in 1980-'81.
</P>
<P>
   Krantz is at the heart of the 1995 racketeering indictments that
allege a joint venture by Bulger and Flemmi with other
organized-crime leaders. From the beginning, the State Police saw
the big picture; the FBI wore blinders.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the 1980s, the issue festered at the bottom of what
had become law-enforcement's poison well, with the State Police and
FBI circling each other with disdain instead of sharing information
and collating evidence.
</P>
<P>
   The case that finally emerged about organized-crime collusion
between Bulger's gang and the Mafia could fill a record room of its
own in the Post Office Square courthouse.
</P>
<P>
   But it was summed up succinctly nearly 20 years ago in a lecture
by an inebriated Ilario Zannino in the bugged back room of a North
End garage at 3:53 in the morning.
</P>
<P>
   Pressing his case for an underling to make fast payment on an
$80,000 gambling debt to Bulger and Flemmi, Zannino warned him in
April 1981 that ``you don't (expletive) them because they're with
us.'' Turning to one of his henchmen for emphasis, he asked Johnny
Cincotti ``Are they with us? Are they with us?''
</P>
<P>
   Cincotti: ``A thousand percent.''

WHITEY ISN'T `THE MAN' ANY LONGER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DICK LEHR  
 c.1997 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Not so long ago, Whitey Bulger had people lining up for
an audience with him in his native South Boston.
</P>
<P>
   They came looking for help when a daughter was being bothered by
a former boyfriend, or a son was looking for a job, or even when a
car was stolen.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had more people coming to him than were going to church for
confession,'' said a close friend of Bulger's.
</P>
<P>
   But those days are gone. Whitey Bulger is no longer the boss of
South Boston, the man whose very name instilled fear and awe.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, one former Bulger associate now grouses, ``He was King
Rat.... If I was one of Whitey's boys, I would have left this town
a long time ago because I'd be embarrassed.''
</P>
<P>
   In the year following the federal government's confirmation that
Bulger led a double life as a crime boss and an FBI informant,
people are now talking about him in ways they never would have
before. With Bulger on the run, and his mythical stature all but
shattered, lips are loosening about the legendary gangster, his
style, and his everyday habits. Even if many still insist their
identities not be revealed.
</P>
<P>
   Bulger turns 70 next year, a gangster with cold eyes best known
for his controlling manner; a ``neat freak'' who hates germs; an
ardent reader; a ``criminal genius.'' He is private to the point of
being antisocial, while his sidekick Stephen ``The Rifleman''
Flemmi is sociable and charming, recall those who know them both.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stevie was always a good friend to me. He was good to me when
Howie was away,'' says Ellen Brogna, wife of Howard T. Winter, the
still-imprisoned and erstwhile leader of the Winter Hill gang of
Somerville, which Bulger and Flemmi eventually took over, expanded,
and made their own. ``Whitey is another story. I stayed clear away
from him.''
</P>
<P>
   Back in the late 1970s, Brogna recalled the time she blocked
Bulger's car in a driveway, and Bulger quickly became incensed when
he fumbled around trying to move her Mustang, unaware of a switch
to release the car keys.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was freezing cold and it took him awhile to get the keys
out, and he came back all flustered,'' she recalls. ``I said,
`You'd think you'd have some common sense to know there'd be a
switch.' He just glared at me. I told Howie he was the most
frightening person I'd ever met. He scared the heart out of me. It
was like looking at Dracula.''
</P>
<P>
   Though some mentioned his sharp wit, others wondered about the
Bulger sense of humor. ``There were a bunch of us up on the roof of
the Rusty Scupper watching the tall ships,'' says Winter himself in
a telephone interview from prison, recalling a party during
Boston's bicentennial celebration. ``All of a sudden there is a
girl screaming.'' Winter said Bulger was pretending he was going to
throw her off the catwalk. ``I was a little embarrassed.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, Bulger and Flemmi moved their base from Marshall
Motors in Somerville, to the Lancaster Street garage in Boston near
the old Boston Garden, to the South Boston Liquor Mart, and to the
D Street Deli. Their cars often served as a kind of mobile office,
and Bulger and Flemmi were skilled at evading agents stalking them.
</P>
<P>
   One favorite move was to drive onto the Southeast Expressway
heading south, roar down the passing lane and then, at the last
second, veer sharply to the right to take the exit leading to
Squantum and their Quincy residences.
</P>
<P>
   During the 1980s, Bulger's day often began at midday at his
condominium in Quincy, where Flemmi or trusted associate Kevin
Weeks would meet him, and they'd head into town. Bulger would eat
dinner with Teresa Stanley, his longtime girlfriend, at her South
Boston home, then conduct business around the city, business that
often included meetings with his FBI handler, John Connolly. Then
he'd head back to Quincy in the early-morning hours, where his
other girlfriend, Catherine Greig, awaited him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He could really talk,'' says Stanley, still smarting over
Bulger's secret romance with the much-younger Greig. ``He had a way
of talking people into believing what he said. He had a way of
turning things around.''
</P>
<P>
   Stanley and Bulger were together nearly three decades, meeting
when she was 25, a single mother with four children. She admits to
still loving him, and talks warmly about how strict and helpful he
was with her kids. But she also feels betrayed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I spent 30 years of my life with him, and 20 of those years he
was with her,'' says Stanley. ``He was leading a double life with
me and a double life with the FBI.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, 23 years after Bulger and Connolly forged a partnership on
an October night at Wollaston Beach, these two principal actors
remain offstage at the ongoing federal court hearings exploring the
FBI's ties to Bulger. For his part, Connolly has asserted his Fifth
Amendment right against self-incrimination. Bulger is literally
gone, a fugitive on the run since 1995 when, says Flemmi, the FBI
tipped them off to their pending indictment. It's a road life he's
apparently adjusted to, driving around with Greig.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has always compartmentalized his life,'' says one longtime
associate _ a life full of phases: bank robber, prison inmate,
crime boss, FBI informant and, now, fugitive. Besides, he's always
liked to travel, taking many trips with Stanley to places like
London, Italy, and Bermuda.
</P>
<P>
   ``He could fit in anywhere,'' says Stanley. ``I think he could
adjust to anything.''

 BOSTON: ... Irish Mafia.''  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In recent interviews, Connolly elaborated further, saying the
pair ``were just as dangerous, if not more dangerous, than the
Mafia.'' Though they never confessed to murder _ and he says they
were never given license to kill _ Connolly now acknowledges they
are killers. ``I don't think they ever killed anyone who wasn't
trying to kill them or wasn't going to rat them out,'' he says.
``They would only kill people who were a threat to them.''
</P>
<P>
   But throughout the 1980s, Connolly spent much of his time
deflecting trouble, as the tips from other informants and police
agencies piled up naming Bulger and Flemmi as suspects in murders,
shakedowns, and big-time drug profiteering.
</P>
<P>
   Even after some fellow FBI agents began thinking the deal stunk
_ believing that the FBI should be targeting Bulger, not pampering
him _ the resilient Connolly repeatedly outmaneuvered his foes. He
went to work creating a pile of paperwork that soft-pedaled
Bulger's role in criminal activity and turned the bureau's
dependency on the gangster into an addiction.
</P>
<P>
   Unsealed for the first time during the past year, Connolly's
memorandums and reports reveal an agent asserting two main
storylines that in combination served to protect his prized
informant. He regularly embellished the value of Bulger's
information while minimizing complaints about his crimes.
</P>
<P>
   It was as if once Connolly put down in writing something Bulger
supposedly said, then it must be true; if Bulger protested his
innocence to murder or some other crime for which he was a suspect,
then that was it, end of story.
</P>
<P>
   Early in 1981, for example, during the FBI's successful bugging
operation of Mafia headquarters, agents taped Mafia underboss
Gennaro Angiulo bragging about Bulger and Flemmi: ``I'll tell you
right now, if I called these guys right now they'd kill any
(expletive) body we tell 'em to.''
</P>
<P>
   Less than two months later, Connolly staked out a contradictory
view, applying what amounted to public-relations polish to Bulger's
reputation: ``It should be noted that the current Title III
(bugging) operations have established that source (Bulger) is not a
`hit man' for Jerry Angiulo, as has been contended,'' wrote
Connolly in a memo.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly from the start in the late 1970s, two views of Bulger
were in irreconcilable competition: the minimalist view constructed
and cared for by Connolly, and the view being assembled by the
dozens of state troopers, Boston and Quincy policemen, and federal
drug agents whose own informants and surveillance efforts were
revealing Bulger as an extortionist, loan shark, and drug
trafficker. Non-FBI officers believed the true challenge was to
nail both the Mafia and Bulger _ not just the Mafia, as the FBI
would have it.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the outside view has prevailed: Racketeering charges
against the fugitive Bulger portray him as a violent underworld
kingpin and drug profiteer. But Connolly's view was the one that
carried the day inside the FBI for nearly two decades; as Bulger's
handler, his reports served as the primary basis for
decision-making by the agency's chain of command. Over time, the
FBI adopted a policy of denial.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   AGENTS SOCIALIZE WITH CRIMINALS
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, Connolly was not alone. Right away he enlarged the
circle of agents with ties to Bulger and Flemmi, relations that
grew social and more personal.
</P>
<P>
   In 1979, Connolly called his pal Nick Gianturco, said he had a
couple of guys who wanted to meet the FBI agent, and then dropped
by with Bulger and Flemmi. Over time, they would go on to dine,
drink, and exchange presents. Despite explicit FBI rules
prohibiting taking gifts, the now-retired Gianturco recently
testified under oath he was unaware of the longstanding ban.
</P>
<P>
   Gianturco has said of Connolly: ``He was by far the best
informant developer I've ever seen in the bureau.'' Over time, the
band of Boston agents enthralled with Connolly's way with Bulger
included Jack Cloherty, Tom Daly, Mike Buckley, and two top
supervisors, Dennis O'Callaghan and James Ahearn.
</P>
<P>
   More dinners followed, and at one gathering two retired agents
who'd been friends of Connolly's in New York joined in on the fun.
``It was obvious ... Whitey Bulger and Steve (Flemmi) were friends
of Connolly's,'' one of the agents, Jules Bonavolonta, told FBI
investigators last year.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Connolly makes no apologies about the intimate
get-togethers. He exchanged gifts with the gangsters, mostly at
Christmas time _ small things, like a book and, one time,
handcarved hunting knives. ``You can't be around those guys for 15
years and not like them,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a respect and an admiration there, no question about
it, but always looming in the background was the realism of what he
did for a living and what I did for a living,'' Connolly added,
referring to Bulger.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, Connolly's style would come in for criticism. ``I
had a meeting with John Connolly in my office,'' testified James A.
Ring, one of Connolly's former supervisors, during recent court
hearings. ``And I told him that what I was observing was contacts
with Mr. Flemmi and Mr. Bulger with, I thought, mistakes that a
first-year agent wouldn't make.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's when I pointed out to him that I didn't need
consultants and that informants were not friends and that
informants were informants, that we should learn from them, and
they should not learn from us.'' But this was too little, too late:
Ring admitted he never documented his concerns nor mentioned them
to the agent in charge of the Boston office.
</P>
<P>
   Then there was John Morris, the former head of the FBI's
organized-crime squad in Boston. In a series of admissions, Morris
testified this past spring how he had hosted secret dinners for
Bulger and Flemmi, taken $7,000 in payoffs, and warned them to stay
away from a bugging operation.
</P>
<P>
   Morris admitted that as Connolly's boss he had signed off on a
mythical view of Bulger that Connolly was manufacturing. Moreover,
not only had Morris approved the paper trail Connolly was amassing,
but he, too, had facilitated the bureau's minimizing of Bulger's
criminality.
</P>
<P>
   It was Morris who in 1981 issued the virtual open-ended promise
of FBI protection for Bulger, a memo that falsely proclaimed the
Winter Hill gang was decimated and therefore did not require any
further pursuit by the bureau.
</P>
<P>
   But the FBI cocoon created for Bulger and Flemmi went beyond
assembling a pile of dubious paperwork. Right from the start, the
FBI deflected trouble from inside and outside the bureau.
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1970s, for example, a frightened restaurant owner in
Dedham told Norfolk County authorities that Bulger and Flemmi had
threatened to kill him if he did not pay off a loan. The case
against the two gangsters was self-evident. But after the FBI
stepped in, the matter went nowhere.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Connolly and Morris were scrambling to extinguish a
threat to Bulger and Flemmi posed by one of the FBI's own
investigations _ an East Coast race-fixing case against the Winter
Hill gang that was nearing indictment in early 1979. In court
recently, Morris testified that Bulger and Flemmi insisted at the
time that they were not involved in the race-fixing. Taking them at
their word, Morris said he and Connolly then sought out federal
prosecutor Jeremiah T. O'Sullivan and succeeded in persuading
O'Sullivan to drop the pair from the case. In a Globe interview,
Connolly said that O'Sullivan set only one condition: that the pair
agree not to kill the government's star witness, Anthony ``Big
Tony'' Ciulla. O'Sullivan's lawyer, Hugh Scott, declined comment.
</P>
<P>
   Flemmi himself has added to recent revelations about the
race-fixing case. Last year in a sworn statement, he first
corroborated Morris's account by saying, ``The FBI had seen to it
that we would not be named in the indictment.'' But he went
further, revealing that the FBI had leaked the timing of the
indictment so he and Bulger could warn a couple of associates to
get out of town. The leak was one of at least a dozen provided by
the FBI, said Flemmi, who added that it became the bureau's
``practice'' to tip them off.
</P>
<P>
   From at least 1979, the hooks were in place _ a habit of
protecting Bulger at all costs _ and it would only worsen once the
payoffs began and the corruption mounted. Through it all, Bulger,
in reports authored by Connolly and others, comes off as the model
of calm, a man on top of the underworld game.
</P>
<P>
   Even when an angered Massachusetts State Police hierarchy in
1980 began suspecting something rotten was festering between Bulger
and the FBI, the gangster seemed unfazed. In late 1980, Connolly
and Morris met at least twice with Bulger and Flemmi to discuss
concerns about their safety if word got out that they were
informants.
</P>
<P>
   The snitches told them not to worry; they sure weren't.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both Bulger and Flemmi emphatically stated that no one in the
underworld would believe that they were informants,'' the agents
reported afterwards. ``It would be too incredible.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   BOSTON'S PRINCE OF THE CITY
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The cocksure Connolly has always been a man about town, moving
easily among different circles of power _ crime, politics, and the
media. Over the years, he was relieved of much of the grunt work,
the doughnut-dependent stakeouts and grinding street-surveillance
work. Instead, he was a prince of the FBI's Boston office, able to
come and go as he pleased and displaying a knack for cozying up to
power.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had the same flip cockiness wise guys have... Made no bones
about his close ties to Billy Bulger,'' said a retired federal
prosecutor in an interview, adding that agents like Connolly end up
protected by the FBI's institutional elitism. ``You couldn't do
anything about it,'' he said. ``They were all insulated in their
arrogance. You just could not permeate it from any other place in
law enforcement. They knew best.''
</P>
<P>
   Connolly was nothing if not connected: He charmed journalists
with FBI stories. And when a new top agent was assigned to oversee
the local office, which consists of about 200 agents, Connolly made
a practice of taking the incoming boss to meet his lifelong friend
and mentor, Bill Bulger, the former state Senate president, now
president of the University of Massachusetts. For his part, Bill
Bulger declined comment about his relationship with Connolly.
</P>
<P>
   Connolly retired in 1990 to a high-salaried security position
with Boston Edison, where he works today. He's an FBI raconteur,
spinning yarns about stalking the Mafia, as well as the idea that
Whitey Bulger actually helped maintain order on the streets of
Boston as a kind of arm of the police.
</P>
<P>
   And along the way he's made some dubious proclamations. After
the truth about the FBI's ties had emerged, Connolly sought out a
top editor of the Globe in 1990 to deny the link _ and to insist
he'd never even talked to Bulger.
</P>
<P>
   The truth is there were hundreds of meetings and conversations
between the two men, a fact now part of a larger truth tumbling out
of locked FBI closets faster than chroniclers of crime and politics
can keep up. Even after his retirement, Connolly continued to talk
with Bulger and Flemmi; at one point he reached out to the gang
leaders after hearing a rumor the Mafia was looking to kill him.
Connolly, who last year told government investigators about this
encounter, said Bulger and Flemmi assured him ``that the threat was
nonsense and that if they had heard of the threat they would have
contacted both him and the FBI to prevent such activity.''
</P>
<P>
   To the end, Connolly says his handling of Bulger was above
reproach. Former agents like Morris, he says, are liars. More
importantly, the deal was vital to achieve the FBI's string of
heady successes against the Mafia in New England, the gemstone
being the 1981 bugging of Mafia headquarters at 98 Prince St. in
Boston's North End.
</P>
<P>
   This is Connolly's refrain: Bulger and Flemmi provided the key
probable cause the FBI needed to win court approval to bug the
Mafiosi. ``They were without a doubt the two single most important
sources we ever had,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   But Connolly's take on history appears skewed. Evidence has
emerged contradicting the very claim on which Connolly and the FBI
have staked the reputation of their Boston office _ that Bulger may
have been bad, but he gave us the Mafia. But did he?

DISPUTING SWORN TESTIMONY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MITCHELL ZUCKOFF  
 c.1997 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The way former FBI agent John Connolly sees it, several
of his onetime colleagues have lied about him under oath.
</P>
<P>
   Connolly, a center-stage figure in the court hearings on FBI
misconduct, has repeatedly disputed damaging statements made by
other agents concerning his dealings with gangland informants James
``Whitey'' Bulger and Stephen ``The Rifleman'' Flemmi.
</P>
<P>
   While the others have made their claims on the witness stand
under oath, Connolly's rebuttals have been made in interviews,
since he has declined to testify, citing his Fifth Amendment right
against self-incrimination.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
------- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   First up was John Morris, Connolly's former FBI supervisor and
head of the organized-crime squad. Morris testified that while he
was attending a conference in Georgia in 1982, he asked Connolly if
Bulger would provide some cash to fly his girlfriend down to join
him. Morris said Connolly gave the woman $1,000, courtesy of the
gangsters. Then in 1984, Morris testified, Connolly was the conduit
for another bribe: a case of expensive wine, with another $1,000
tucked inside.
</P>
<P>
   Morris also testified that in 1979 or 1980, he asked Connolly
about Bulger and Flemmi's motives: ``What do they want of us?'' The
answer Morris said he received was: ``a head start.''
</P>
<P>
   Connolly called Morris's bribe testimony ``a malicious lie.'' He
added: ``In my entire career with the FBI I never compromised my
personal or professional integrity.'' In a telephone interview with
his lawyer Robert Popeo on the line, Connolly said the ``head
start'' comment was ``pure fiction.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
------- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   James Ring, another former chief in the organized-crime squad,
testified that a dinner meeting in 1983 or 1984 arranged by
Connolly was interrupted by a brief visit from then-Senate
President William Bulger, the gangster's younger brother. Bill
Bulger was a neighbor of Flemmi's parents, hosts of the dinner
party. Ring also testified that he upbraided Connolly for cozy
treatment of the gangsters.
</P>
<P>
   Connolly said Ring was ``hallucinating'' and denied that Bill
Bulger was present ``at that or any other meeting I attended at the
home of Mr. Flemmi's parents.'' Bill Bulger also denied Ring's
testimony. As for the reprimand, Connolly said it never happened.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
------- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Robert Fitzpatrick, a former FBI supervisor, testified that
another FBI agent had accused Connolly of rifling through his files
on the 1981 murder of Roger Wheeler, an Oklahoma jai-alai
executive. Fitzpatrick said the other agent believed Connolly had
shared information with Bulger, a suspect in the case.
</P>
<P>
   Connolly called that ``ludicrous.'' He said such a breach would
have triggered an investigation, but that never happened. He said
he actually helped the agent by arranging for Bulger and Flemmi to
be questioned about Wheeler's murder.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
------- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Roderick J. Kennedy, a retired FBI agent, testified that
Connolly told him that Bulger and Flemmi had extorted $60,000 to
$90,000 from a drug dealer who had stored marijuana in South Boston
without their permission. Kennedy said no one from the FBI shared
that information with the Drug Enforcement Administration, which
was trying to build a case at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Connolly said he never told Kennedy any such thing. He also
dismissed Kennedy as a man with a drinking problem who was fired
from the FBI for pocketing informant money.
</P>
<P>
   Almost as an afterthought, Kennedy testified that Connolly once
told him ``they'll never get Bulger because he's too smart.''

THE MYTHS OF WHITEY BULGER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DICK LEHR  
 c.1997 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Back in the 1970s, Whitey Bulger became an FBI
informant.
</P>
<P>
   Until the FBI acknowledged that fact a year ago, the notion of
Bulger the Rat was unthinkable. But with the release of once-secret
FBI files, two decades of Bulger mythology have unraveled.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
_____ &QC; 
 &QL; 
MYTH: Bulger was the ultimate stand-up gangster who not only
demanded loyalty from his own but viewed snitches as the lowest
form of life. Indeed, a Bulger soldier, John ``Red'' Shea, once
described what he would do to an informant, starting with a bat.
``I'd take my best swing across his head,'' Shea said. ``I'd watch
his head come off his shoulders... Then I'd take a chainsaw and cut
his toes off.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
REALITY: Bulger was an informant for nearly 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
_____ &QC; 
 &QL; 
MYTH: He wasn't really an informant. His FBI handler, John
Connolly, says that when he and Bulger got together in 1975, ``He
told me, `I will not be called an informant. I will be your
strategist.'''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
REALITY: Wordplay aside, Bulger was an FBI informant.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
_____ &QC; 
 &QL; 
MYTH: Even if it has turned out he was a longtime FBI informant,
Bulger only ratted on the Mafia, not his own. For instance,
Connolly repeatedly has told others that Bulger set the terms for
his cooperation, quoting Bulger: ``I'm never hurting any of my
friends or (IRA members) . I'll only consult with you on these
(expletive) people _ the LCN (La Cosa Nostra).''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
REALITY: Though Bulger did concentrate on the Mafia, he also
provided information about his own associates.
</P>
<P>
   The Bulger informant reports included mention of such
non-Mafiosi as Howie Winter, Joe McDonald, Jimmy Sims, and Johnny
Martorano, all members of Bulger's Winter Hill gang. He said that
automatic weapons held by Joe McDonald were for the IRA. There is
even information about his partner, Stephen ``The Rifleman''
Flemmi. Bulger reported in 1979 that Flemmi was so incensed about a
beating his daughter suffered at a nightclub in Kenmore Square he
``may whack out'' the owner and burn down the club.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
_____ &QC; 
 &QL; 
MYTH: Bulger was unequivocally against drug dealers, a poster boy
for antidrug efforts, especially in Southie. In a 1980 FBI report,
a self-serving Bulger told the FBI he ``is not in the drug business
and personally hates anyone who does; therefore he and any of his
associates do not deal in drugs.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
REALITY: The only drug dealers Bulger despised were the ones who
had not paid him a fee; Bulger reputedly extorted huge profits from
dealers, including in South Boston.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
_____ &QC; 
 &QL; 
MYTH: Prior to his 1995 indictment, Bulger had not been arrested in
three decades _ proof of a charmed life and his legendary savvy in
outfoxing investigators.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
REALITY: Though cunning, the lucky charm in his life was the
protection the FBI provided him. Because he was an informant, the
FBI did not target him. It also warned Bulger about bugs and
investigations other agencies were mounting against him. In sworn
affidavits, Flemmi last year cited more than a dozen leaks he and
Bulger received from the FBI over the years.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: ON THE STARTING LINE TO THE 2000 RACE
 &HT;    For release Sunday, July 26
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The one truth in presidential campaigns is ... that
there is no one truth to be found there. Rather, there are lots of
forks in the political trail that lead to either success or ruin.
</P>
<P>
   Take the election of 1960. In the run-up to the campaign, there
was one serious candidate on the Republican side _ Vice President
Richard Nixon _ and five top-tier candidates among the Democrats:
Adlai Stevenson and Sens. Hubert Humphrey of Minnesota, Lyndon
Johnson of Texas, John Kennedy of Massachusetts and Stuart
Symington of Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   Early conventional wisdom among political insiders had Symington
winning the nomination. For one thing, Symington looked the way
Hollywood thought presidents should look. For another, his four
rivals were thought to be weighed down by fatal flaws.
</P>
<P>
   Stevenson had already lost twice. Humphrey was too liberal.
Johnson was too much of a wheeler-dealer. Kennedy had a skimpy
legislative record and was a Roman Catholic, a faith embraced by no
former occupant of the White House.
</P>
<P>
   But conventional wisdom proved wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Now, 40 years later, there's one serious candidate on the
Democratic side _ Vice President Al Gore _ and five potential
top-tier candidates among the Republicans: Gov. George W. Bush of
Texas, former Vice President Dan Quayle, publishing magnate Steve
Forbes, former Tennessee Gov. Lamar Alexander and Sen. John
Ashcroft of Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   Early conventional wisdom among political insiders rules out
Ashcroft. A first-term senator, he is seen as too stiff to succeed
on the stump. What's more, each of Ashcroft's four rivals has, in
one way or another, already cut his teeth in a presidential
campaign, a rite of passage that Republicans seem to value highly.
(For Bush, admittedly, that rite has occurred only in a dynastic
sense.)
</P>
<P>
   Could conventional wisdom prove wrong again?
</P>
<P>
   Ashcroft, offering a pundit a ham sandwich and a pickle during
an hour-long visit to his office, comes across as a staunch social
and economic conservative. The son and grandson of Bible Belt
ministers, he begins our lunch with a devout prayer.
</P>
<P>
   When prodded, Ashcroft makes it clear that he believes the Bible
interprets homosexuality to be a sin. ``But,'' he adds,
``homosexuality doesn't appear on any public policy agenda that I
would want to impose. It's not the role of government to inquire
into religion or into a person's private beliefs.''
</P>
<P>
   As a former two-term governor, Ashcroft does believe that the
U.S. health care system needs reform; that, at a time of budget
surpluses, federal taxes are too high, and that Social Security
needs to be strengthened through investments in equity markets,
while protecting folks who want to retain their current deal.
</P>
<P>
   The Iowa caucuses, where the road to the White House really
begins, are still 18 months off. A lot could happen between now and
then. But so long as Iowa still borders on Missouri come 2000,
Ashcroft is likely to show up and, just maybe, do very well there.

 &HT;    
 By MIKE McMANUS  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    
 &HT;    On June 10, Wisconsin's Supreme Court issued an historic
decision, the first in America by a high court, to permit state
funding of a voucher system enabling up to 15,700 low-income public
school students to attend religious schools.
 &HT;    By a 4-2 vote the court said the Milwaukee Parental Choice
Program does not violate either the First Amendment or the
Wisconsin Constitution's provisions prohibiting public funding of
religious schools.
 &HT;    Gov. Tommy Thompson, who pushed for the law, exulted:
``Religious values aren't our problem. Dropout rates and low test
scores are. This is not only going to allow for choice, but for
competition among schools -- public and private.''
 &HT;    Indeed, in Milwaukee Public Schools, fewer than 4 out of 10
graduate from high school, while 95 percent of students in Catholic
schools graduate.
 &HT;    The original version of the Choice law, passed in 1990, provided
state funding for 1,500 vouchers for students from low-income
families to attend private, non-religious schools in Milwaukee.
After five years, a Harvard study found those students' test scores
rose 3 to 5 percentage points higher in reading and 5 to 12 points
higher in math than students who wanted, but were unable to get,
the limited number of state scholarships.
 &HT;    These results are so significant that researchers predict that,
if applied nationally, the gap between white and minority student
test scores could narrow by 33 percent to 50 percent, according to
the 1998 edition of ''School Choice Programs'' published by the
Heritage Foundation.
 &HT;    Therefore, Wisconsin's legislature voted in 1995 to expand the
Choice program to include a tenth of Milwaukee's children, 15,700
of those from homes whose incomes were within 175 percent of the
poverty line, a figure that makes 65,000 to 70,000 Milwaukee kids
eligible.
 &HT;    Schools would be paid for their operating costs or the average
per-pupil school aid to the city's schools ($4,900 this year),
whichever is less.
 &HT;    In recent years, 20 Catholic elementary schools and six high
schools have had to close, due to falling enrollments. The diocese
hired Dan McKinley to help raise funds to keep schools open. But
few showed interest until he organized a group independent of the
diocese, known as PAVE, Partners Advancing Values in Education.
 &HT;    Suddenly, perhaps due to sympathy that the state subsidies could
only help kids attending non-parochial schools, he was able to
raise enough to give 1,900 scholarships in 1992-3 to children
attending not only 40 Catholic elementary and seven high schools,
but 28 Missouri Synod, four Jewish and three Muslim schools.
 &HT;    After the 1995 expansion of state vouchers was passed by the
Legislature, the ACLU and teacher unions filed a suit, blocking the
spending of any new money, one day before school started. Children
who had enrolled in the religious-based schools were suddenly
without support. PAVE was able to raise $1.6 million and give 50
percent scholarships to 2,000 students.
 &HT;    This year PAVE gave 4,400 scholarships worth $4.2 million,
underwriting a third of Catholic school students, with much of the
support coming from the business community.
 &HT;    The Wisconsin Supreme Court opinion was carefully written to be
able to meet criteria set down by the U.S. Supreme Court as to what
is constitutional in the separation of church and state.
Wisconsin's court said the Choice program does not violate the
First Amendment's ''Establishment clause because it has a secular
purpose, it will not have the primary effect of advancing religion
and it will not lead to excessive entanglement between the state
and participating sectarian schools.''
 &HT;    Why? Because decisions on whether children go to religious or
non-religious schools are left up to individual parents. The court
said, ''Wisconsin has traditionally accorded parents the primary
role in decision-making regarding the education and upbringing of
children.'' It quoted an 1899 Wisconsin Supreme Court decision
saying that parents have ''the most effective motivation'' and
''the strongest obligation'' to give their children ''nurture,
education and training.''
 &HT;    Therefore, parents should be trusted to be ''neutral between
sectarian and non-sectarian alternatives.'' The court added,
''Public funds generally may be provided to sectarian educational
institutions so long as steps are taken not to subsidize religious
functions.''
 &HT;    The decision is so strongly worded that the ACLU and teachers
have not decided whether to appeal it to the U.S. Supreme Court.
Voucher advocates hope it is appealed, confident the U.S. Supreme
Court would affirm Wisconsin's landmark ruling.
 &HT;    James Skillen, director of the Center for Public Justice, says,
''This case puts an end to using First Amendment arguments to keep
from reforming education via vouchers. We will see more and more
voucher proposals that will let the parents of poor children choose
non-governmental schools, including religious ones. This is the
wave of the future. We are over the hump.''

   Mrs. Wu had entered the emergency room at New York Downtown
Hospital gasping for air. The elderly woman had been shopping with
her daughter when suddenly her legs lost power and her lungs grew
tight. Wu's electrotrocardiogram _ the tracing of electrical
activity in the heart _ looked erratic. Instead of a smooth tracing
bringing forth 80 beautifully spaced spikes a minute, it was
spitting out a rapid-fire and asynchronous 140 spikes, or
heartbeats, a minute. Her ailment: atrial fibrillation. Tony Dajer,
former associate director of the emergency room at New York
Downtown Hospital, reports on the wonder substance that saved Wu's
life _ and that can be found right in your own medicine cabinet.

   Surgeons make big incisions because of the need to get their
hands in the body. But with tiny robotic hands, their incisions
would be smaller _ and less traumatic _ reports Kathy A. Svitil, an

   Mrs. Wu had entered the emergency room at New York Downtown
Hospital gasping for air. The elderly woman had been shopping with
her daughter when suddenly her legs lost power and her lungs grew
tight. Wu's electrotrocardiogram _ the tracing of electrical
activity in the heart _ looked erratic. Instead of a smooth tracing
bringing forth 80 beautifully spaced spikes a minute, it was
spitting out a rapid-fire and asynchronous 140 spikes, or
heartbeats, a minute. Her ailment: atrial fibrillation. Tony Dajer,
former associate director of the emergency room at New York
Downtown Hospital, reports on the wonder substance that saved Wu's
life _ and that can be found right in your own medicine cabinet.

   Since it was developed a decade ago, laparoscopic surgery _ in
which instruments are inserted through small incisions _ has been
used by surgeons whenever possible. Patients are less traumatized,
require shorter hospital stays and heal faster than with
conventional surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Yet despite the benefits, laparoscopy is a challenging
procedure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Surgeons find it hard,'' says Shankar Sastry, an electrical
engineer at the University of California at Berkeley. ``It's like
operating with chopsticks.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, laparoscopic instruments are mainly limited to scissors,
staplers (to close incisions or attach blood vessels) and graspers
(to manipulate tissue).
</P>
<P>
   The instruments enter the body through a long tube. A video
image from a tiny camera called an endoscope poked through another
incision guides the surgeon.
</P>
<P>
   For a relatively simple procedure like gallbladder removal, the
tools work well enough. But surgeons can't use the instruments to
perform complicated tasks like suturing and knot tying. Because of
these limitations, Sastry says, most operations can't be performed
endoscopically.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would like to do something like a colectomy
laparoscopically because there is less trauma to the patient. These
people are already pretty sick, and if you then press them to
undergo a traumatic operation, they could die. But it's not a good
idea to staple the ends of the colon together, and that is the
reason minimally invasive surgery is not done,'' Sastry says. ``And
of course the real prize is to be able to do cardiac surgery this
way.''
</P>
<P>
   Sastry and his Berkeley colleagues have developed laparoscopic
tools _ including miniature robotic hands with the dexterity to tie
knots _ that bring surgeons closer to that prize.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason you have to cut a person open is to get the
surgeon's hands in there,'' he says. ``They like to get their hands
around the organs, to palpate them. It's what they are used to. But
if you can get little instruments in there that let the surgeons
feel as if they are working with their hands in a normal procedure,
you don't have to have a big incision.''
</P>
<P>
   The Berkeley system consists of a pencil-size joystick (one each
for the surgeon's right and left hands), a computer, and right-hand
and left-hand end effectors _ the robotic instruments that snake
into the body to perform the actual surgery.
</P>
<P>
   In early models these resembled three-fingered hands. Now each
hydraulically powered end effector consists of a single digit,
three to four inches long and less than half an inch wide. It has
four joints that rotate, swivel and swing back and forth and a
grasper at the end. The result: A finger that functions like an
entire hand.
</P>
<P>
   To operate, a surgeon _ who can be in the same room as the
patient or at a remote location _ uses the joysticks just as he
would normal surgical instruments. A computer program translates
the surgeon's motions into the movements of the end effectors.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is completely anthropomorphic,'' Sastry says. ``If you move
in, the instrument moves in; if you move to the right, the
instrument moves to the right.''
</P>
<P>
   The system also has force feedback, which relays to doctors the
response of muscles and other tissues to their actions. The
feedback makes the procedure feel more like normal surgery.
</P>
<P>
   The research team is also working on tactile sensors that will
transmit the feel of tissue to the surgeon's fingertips.
</P>
<P>
   As this article is being written, surgeons at the University of
California at San Francisco Medical Center are about to test the
system by performing colectomies on pigs. If the trial succeeds,
and the FDA gives its approval, clinical trials on humans could
begin next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The overall goal,'' Sastry says, ``is pretty lofty: to not cut
a person open unless there is just nothing else to do _ for
instance, if you have to replace a hip, there is no choice but to
get in there and remove the old hip _ but in every instance to make
sutures and cuts that are as small as possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``The challenge is to give surgeons the feel of open surgery
with all the benefits of minimally invasive surgery, and that's
where I'd like us to go.''

   ``Magnesium?'' Winnie asked, keeping her tone as loose as an
unwinding coil of slack line.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yup. Magnesium,'' I repeated. ``One gram IV.''
</P>
<P>
   Once she was sure I meant it, she produced the vial. ``One gram,
coming up.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Wu, our elderly patient, had come in gasping for air. She
had been shopping with her daughter when suddenly her legs lost
power and her lungs grew right.
</P>
<P>
   As soon as Mrs. Wu arrived, Winnie had put her on oxygen. Now
she seemed a little better. But she still clutched her daughter's
hand and kept up a steady singsong of Cantonese.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Wu's electrotrocardiogram _ the tracing of electrical
activity in the heart _ looked erratic. Instead of a smooth tracing
bringing forth 80 beautifully spaced spikes a minute, it was
spitting out a rapid-fire and asynchronous 140 spikes, or
heartbeats, a minute.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Wu's heart was creating a painting that already had a
title: atrial fibrillation.
</P>
<P>
   Our hearts have four chambers to handle the intricate job of
replenishing oxygen-poor blood and pumping it out. While the right
atrium and right ventricle pump oxygen-poor blood from the body out
to the lungs, the left atrium and left ventricle receive
oxygen-rich blood from the lungs and pump it to the rest of the
body.
</P>
<P>
   The atria and ventricles must work together to achieve the
split-second timing that allows the chambers of the heart to pump
blood in and out some 60 to 100 times a minute, day in day out.
</P>
<P>
   The atria set the rhythm for the muscular contractions we call
the heartbeat, and the ventricles supply the horsepower.
</P>
<P>
   A heartbeat begins when the natural pacemaker in the right
atrium fires. The electric discharge then ripples through the
atria, which contract to propel blood into the ventricles.
</P>
<P>
   To set off a contraction in the ventricles, the electric signals
then passes through a cluster of cells called the atrioventricular
node _ in the fibrous tissue separating the atria from the
ventricles below.
</P>
<P>
   The signal then streaks down specialized trunk cables called
Purkinje fibers that fan out into the thick ventricular muscle and
bring forth a life-giving contraction.
</P>
<P>
   In Mrs. Wu's case, each atrial cell was blaring at will like an
orchestra in revolt. Millions of clashing electric wavelets reduced
her atrial ripple to chaos.
</P>
<P>
   There are many conditions that can cause atrial fibrillation.
But it can also mysteriously pounce on healthy young people. In
Mrs. Wu's case, her 72 years were probably to blame, though we
would still hunt for the usual suspects.
</P>
<P>
   I glanced at the overhead monitor. Mrs. Wu watched me intently.
She raised her tight hand and fluttered it over her chest. ``Yes, I
know,'' I nodded.
</P>
<P>
   Her heartbeats came in a rush of fluorescent green spikes. The
squiggly chaos in between represented her atria shuddering _ 500
times a minute.
</P>
<P>
   Luckily, the atrioventricular node is a responsible gatekeeper;
it doesn't respond to every erratic atrial discharge, or the
ventricles would quiver into life-ending impotence.
</P>
<P>
   But the atrioventricular node can't always hold down the atrial
cacophony. In some cases, when it fails, the ventricles beat too
fast and fill inefficiently. Blood pressure then drops and blood
starts eddying back into the lungs, cutting off oxygen flow to the
body.
</P>
<P>
   The solution is theoretically simple: Boost the atrioventricular
node's blocking power and slow down the ventricles. Resynchronizing
the atria would be even better, but that's a harder trick.
</P>
<P>
   Atrial fibrillation has been recognized for centuries. And so,
curiously, has the mainstay of treatment, digitalis.
</P>
<P>
   In 1785, William Withering described the foxglove plant's
``power over the motion of the heart.'' He had his patients chew
the foxglove leaf for the desired effect.
</P>
<P>
   We modern hotshots now understand that the active principle in
foxglove is digitalis, and we use a digitalis analogue _ digoxin _
in pills and intravenous solution.
</P>
<P>
   The compound works, through a complicated mechanism, by boosting
the atrioventricular node's damping action and thus slowing the
ventricular rate.
</P>
<P>
   There are newer drugs to be sure, but each has its drawback.
Among the most widely used is diltiazem _ a calcium channel
blocker. But that brings us to ions, and magnesium, and ancient
seas.
</P>
<P>
   Electrical impulses _ the life-giving current between nerve and
muscle cells _ arose when our primordial ancestors fashioned cell
membranes that strictly control the flow of different ions in and
out of the cell. (An ion is a molecule or atom that has lost or
gained an electron; the main players in heart tissue are potassium,
sodium and calcium ions.)
</P>
<P>
   Cells in the heart suck potassium ions in and push sodium ions
out. This inside-outside difference is achieved by pumps in the
cell membrane that work like submicroscopic waterwheels, exchanging
sodium ions for potassium ions.
</P>
<P>
   The resulting segregation of ions creates a small electrical
potential within the cell. But electrical impulses cannot travel
from cell to cell without another mechanism: ion channels embedded
in the cell membrane.
</P>
<P>
   When jolted by an electric discharge from a neighboring cell,
certain ion channels in the cell membrane open, allowing sodium
ions to pour in. When the influx of sodium reaches a threshold, it
triggers the release of electrons from the cell _ this is the
electrical impulse.
</P>
<P>
   Ion channels in a neighboring cell sense the electron discharge
and open, allowing sodium ions to rush in. This, in turn, changes
the charge within that cell, causing it to unleash a storm of
electrons to its neighbor.
</P>
<P>
   Its a domino effect that happens so fast that the electrical
impulse is propagated nearly instantaneously across the cardiac
muscle. The result: The coordinated contraction we call the
heartbeat.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the first cell's pumps drive sodium ions out and suck
potassium ions back in, thus restoring the cell's original state of
affairs.
</P>
<P>
   The bandleaders of this intricate sequence are the pacemaker
cells. They and the cells in the atrioventricular node depend not
on sodium but on a third ion, calcium, to slowly leak in through
its channels and trigger a discharge.
</P>
<P>
   This system of channels and pumps makes the most intricate
watchwork look like child's play. But its intricacy is also its
weak point. When the timing mechanism is off, normally obedient
cells start firing on their own, sparking all sorts of mayhem,
which is where magnesium _ call it the damage-control ion _ comes
in.
</P>
<P>
   Magnesium sulfate, the stuff of Epsom salts and an essential
nutrient, has been recognized for more than 40 years as having
antiarrhythmic properties.
</P>
<P>
   When I checked in on Mrs. Wu, I found her with her eyes closed,
but her hand kept fluttering over her chest like an anxious
sparrow.
</P>
<P>
   The faster I slowed Mrs. Wu's rate the better. Digitalis would
work, but it takes three hours for its effects to be felt. While
diltiazem, the calcium channel blocker, works more quickly, it can
drop a patient's blood pressure. And Mrs. Wu's was 100 systolic,
which was a bit borderline.
</P>
<P>
   I watched the magnesium drip into Mrs. Wu's IV. No change. Her
monitor still pattered as before.
</P>
<P>
   ``OK, OK give her the digoxin,'' I sighed to Winnie. She smiled
consolingly.
</P>
<P>
   I left the cardiac room to see other patients. Ten minutes
later, she was tugging at my sleeve.
</P>
<P>
   ``She converted,'' Winnie announced.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Mrs. Wu.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Already?'' Puzzled, I said, ``Boy, that digoxin worked fast.''
Though I knew very well that it usually only slows the rate without
making it stable.
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' Winnie insisted. ``The magnesium.'' Then she held up a
syringe filled with a clear solution. ``Digoxin. I haven't given it
yet. It was the magnesium.''
</P>
<P>
   We rushed back together. Mrs. Wu's monitor beeped contentedly at
a regular 84 beats a minute. Her daughter smiled at us and placed a
hand over her own heart and said, ``Much better. Not so fast now.''
</P>
<P>
   A resident later asked me how I had treated Mrs. Wu. My response
caused his eyes to open wide in surprise.
</P>
<P>
   ``Epsom salts,'' I explained, ``magnesium sulfate. I guess now
we're going to have to do a study ...''

   ``Magnesium?'' Winnie asked, keeping her tone as loose as an
unwinding coil of slack line.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yup. Magnesium,'' I repeated. ``One gram IV.''
</P>
<P>
   Once she was sure I meant it, she produced the vial. ``One gram,
coming up.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Wu, our elderly patient, had come in gasping for air. She
had been shopping with her daughter when suddenly her legs lost
power and her lungs grew right.
</P>
<P>
   As soon as Mrs. Wu arrived, Winnie had put her on oxygen. Now
she seemed a little better. But she still clutched her daughter's
hand and kept up a steady singsong of Cantonese.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Wu's electrotrocardiogram _ the tracing of electrical
activity in the heart _ looked erratic. Instead of a smooth tracing
bringing forth 80 beautifully spaced spikes a minute, it was
spitting out a rapid-fire and asynchronous 140 spikes, or
heartbeats, a minute.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Wu's heart was creating a painting that already had a
title: atrial fibrillation.
</P>
<P>
   Our hearts have four chambers to handle the intricate job of
replenishing oxygen-poor blood and pumping it out. While the right
atrium and right ventricle pump oxygen-poor blood from the body out
to the lungs, the left atrium and left ventricle receive
oxygen-rich blood from the lungs and pump it to the rest of the
body.
</P>
<P>
   The atria and ventricles must work together to achieve the
split-second timing that allows the chambers of the heart to pump
blood in and out some 60 to 100 times a minute, day in day out.
</P>
<P>
   The atria set the rhythm for the muscular contractions we call
the heartbeat, and the ventricles supply the horsepower.
</P>
<P>
   A heartbeat begins when the natural pacemaker in the right
atrium fires. The electric discharge then ripples through the
atria, which contract to propel blood into the ventricles.
</P>
<P>
   To set off a contraction in the ventricles, the electric signals
then passes through a cluster of cells called the atrioventricular
node _ in the fibrous tissue separating the atria from the
ventricles below.
</P>
<P>
   The signal then streaks down specialized trunk cables called
Purkinje fibers that fan out into the thick ventricular muscle and
bring forth a life-giving contraction.
</P>
<P>
   In Mrs. Wu's case, each atrial cell was blaring at will like an
orchestra in revolt. Millions of clashing electric wavelets reduced
her atrial ripple to chaos.
</P>
<P>
   There are many conditions that can cause atrial fibrillation.
But it can also mysteriously pounce on healthy young people. In
Mrs. Wu's case, her 72 years were probably to blame, though we
would still hunt for the usual suspects.
</P>
<P>
   I glanced at the overhead monitor. Mrs. Wu watched me intently.
She raised her tight hand and fluttered it over her chest. ``Yes, I
know,'' I nodded.
</P>
<P>
   Her heartbeats came in a rush of fluorescent green spikes. The
squiggly chaos in between represented her atria shuddering _ 500
times a minute.
</P>
<P>
   Luckily, the atrioventricular node is a responsible gatekeeper;
it doesn't respond to every erratic atrial discharge, or the
ventricles would quiver into life-ending impotence.
</P>
<P>
   But the atrioventricular node can't always hold down the atrial
cacophony. In some cases, when it fails, the ventricles beat too
fast and fill inefficiently. Blood pressure then drops and blood
starts eddying back into the lungs, cutting off oxygen flow to the
body.
</P>
<P>
   The solution is theoretically simple: Boost the atrioventricular
node's blocking power and slow down the ventricles. Resynchronizing
the atria would be even better, but that's a harder trick.
</P>
<P>
   Atrial fibrillation has been recognized for centuries. And so,
curiously, has the mainstay of treatment, digitalis.
</P>
<P>
   In 1785, William Withering described the foxglove plant's
``power over the motion of the heart.'' He had his patients chew
the foxglove leaf for the desired effect.
</P>
<P>
   We modern hotshots now understand that the active principle in
foxglove is digitalis, and we use a digitalis analogue _ digoxin _
in pills and intravenous solution.
</P>
<P>
   The compound works, through a complicated mechanism, by boosting
the atrioventricular node's damping action and thus slowing the
ventricular rate.
</P>
<P>
   There are newer drugs to be sure, but each has its drawback.
Among the most widely used is diltiazem _ a calcium channel
blocker. But that brings us to ions, and magnesium, and ancient
seas.
</P>
<P>
   Electrical impulses _ the life-giving current between nerve and
muscle cells _ arose when our primordial ancestors fashioned cell
membranes that strictly control the flow of different ions in and
out of the cell. (An ion is a molecule or atom that has lost or
gained an electron; the main players in heart tissue are potassium,
sodium and calcium ions.)
</P>
<P>
   Cells in the heart suck potassium ions in and push sodium ions
out. This inside-outside difference is achieved by pumps in the
cell membrane that work like submicroscopic waterwheels, exchanging
sodium ions for potassium ions.
</P>
<P>
   The resulting segregation of ions creates a small electrical
potential within the cell. But electrical impulses cannot travel
from cell to cell without another mechanism: ion channels embedded
in the cell membrane.
</P>
<P>
   When jolted by an electric discharge from a neighboring cell,
certain ion channels in the cell membrane open, allowing sodium
ions to pour in. When the influx of sodium reaches a threshold, it
triggers the release of electrons from the cell _ this is the
electrical impulse.
</P>
<P>
   Ion channels in a neighboring cell sense the electron discharge
and open, allowing sodium ions to rush in. This, in turn, changes
the charge within that cell, causing it to unleash a storm of
electrons to its neighbor.
</P>
<P>
   Its a domino effect that happens so fast that the electrical
impulse is propagated nearly instantaneously across the cardiac
muscle. The result: The coordinated contraction we call the
heartbeat.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the first cell's pumps drive sodium ions out and suck
potassium ions back in, thus restoring the cell's original state of
affairs.
</P>
<P>
   The bandleaders of this intricate sequence are the pacemaker
cells. They and the cells in the atrioventricular node depend not
on sodium but on a third ion, calcium, to slowly leak in through
its channels and trigger a discharge.
</P>
<P>
   This system of channels and pumps makes the most intricate
watchwork look like child's play. But its intricacy is also its
weak point. When the timing mechanism is off, normally obedient
cells start firing on their own, sparking all sorts of mayhem,
which is where magnesium _ call it the damage-control ion _ comes
in.
</P>
<P>
   Magnesium sulfate, the stuff of Epsom salts and an essential
nutrient, has been recognized for more than 40 years as having
antiarrhythmic properties.
</P>
<P>
   When I checked in on Mrs. Wu, I found her with her eyes closed,
but her hand kept fluttering over her chest like an anxious
sparrow.
</P>
<P>
   The faster I slowed Mrs. Wu's rate the better. Digitalis would
work, but it takes three hours for its effects to be felt. While
diltiazem, the calcium channel blocker, works more quickly, it can
drop a patient's blood pressure. And Mrs. Wu's was 100 systolic,
which was a bit borderline.
</P>
<P>
   I watched the magnesium drip into Mrs. Wu's IV. No change. Her
monitor still pattered as before.
</P>
<P>
   ``OK, OK give her the digoxin,'' I sighed to Winnie. She smiled
consolingly.
</P>
<P>
   I left the cardiac room to see other patients. Ten minutes
later, she was tugging at my sleeve.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Helms blocks way to world court agreement
 &HT;    By Tom Teepen
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Few in this country beyond our foreign-policy cognoscenti
noticed, but while the world was recently and enthusiastically
adopting a basic American ideal, Washington copped out. There were
two reasons: ``Jesse'' and ``Helms.''
</P>
<P>
   After a month of intense negotiations in Rome, 120 nations voted
to create a standing world court with jurisdiction to try
government leaders or their agents for war crimes and for crimes
against humanity; that is, for genocide or lesser atrocities.
</P>
<P>
   We joined Libya, Iran, Iraq, Qatar, Yemen, China and Israel in
opposition _ not altogether swell company.
</P>
<P>
   Washington's unease _ and Israel's, for they are similar _ is
not irrational. There is always a ready motley of nations keen to
decry the odd American misstep as proof the United States is the
world's great human-rights abuser, while giving a bye to despots
who torture dissenters for after-dinner entertainment or wipe out
national minorities while nobody is looking.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon in particular worries that any permanent world
court could be misused against U.S. armed forces sent on
politically contentious peacekeeping operations like the one in
Bosnia or, earlier, the mess in Somalia.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiations, however, produced a system that is loaded at the
front end against harassing or tendentious use of the court.
Crucially, no one could be hauled to the bar unless the home
country defaulted its jurisdiction. The United States reliably
brings its bad eggs to legal account.
</P>
<P>
   Our closest allies _ Britain, Germany, Canada and so on _ signed
on and urged Washington to. But we'll never know whether their
reassurances were sound, because the Clinton administration refused
to submit the idea to the political process, the venue which should
be best suited to parse it and come to a reasoned conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   Seeming to negotiate, the administration was in fact backing
away from the Rome talks from their start, and small wonder.
</P>
<P>
   As chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, throwback Sen.
Jesse Helms, R-N.C., who undermines U.S. participation in
international organizations whenever he can, had declared
membership in a world court dead on arrival if President Clinton
dared to present an agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Even if, just for political mischief, Helms had let the idea out
of his committee, it would have failed in the current Senate. And
senators who voted for it would have found themselves being savaged
on talk radio and in re-election campaigns as anti-American
one-worlders.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton White House declined to take on the Pentagon over a
futility and put itself and Senate Democrats at gratuitous
political risk, and it is impossible to argue with the calculation.
But if the quailing was understandable, it was still regrettable.
</P>
<P>
   It is a measure of the degree to which our political culture has
degenerated that a concept of our own provenance, going back to the
Nuremberg trials after World War II, could expect no better these
days than fatal demagoguery even in the Senate, once considered a
relatively serious deliberative chamber. We should be embarrassed
but, then, to be embarrassed we'd first have to care, wouldn't we?

 &HT;    ``The comedy writer'' aims high but takes a pratfall
 &HT;    By Scott Eyman
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   THE COMEDY WRITER, by Peter Farrelly. Doubleday; 351 pages;
$12.95.
</P>
<P>
   Henry Halloran is reeling. Amanda, his girlfriend in Boston, has
dumped him, and she was only perfect. It's not as if he was going
to marry her or anything, but he hadn't planned on getting dumped.
</P>
<P>
   So Henry does the least logical thing: He heads west to write
movies. There's nothing keeping him in the Northeast, and, at 32,
with a rotten job, he might as well roll the dice.
</P>
<P>
   Henry writes a script called ``How I Won Her Back,'' more or
less the story of his relationship with Amanda, except with a happy
ending. It's a good script; it gets Henry an agent, it gets Henry
meetings around town. And it enables him to keep obsessing about
Amanda, keep calling her even though it's clear she wants nothing
to do with him.
</P>
<P>
   But Henry is doomed. Soon after he arrives in Los Angeles, he
notices a woman perched on the top of a building. In a clumsily
handled scene especially regrettable because it's the motivating
force for the entire ramshackle novel that is ``The Comedy
Writer,'' Henry tries to talk her down. But Henry's bad luck with
women continues, and she takes the long leap.
</P>
<P>
   Henry writes a piece about the encounter that's published by The
Los Angeles Times; soon, he finds the woman's deeply strange sister
on his doorstep, wanting to find out about her sister's last
moments; soon, she's moved in on him.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Farrelly has written one previous novel, as well as
co-written and co-directed ``Dumb and Dumber,'' the erratic but
awesomely funny Woody Harrelson/Bill Murray movie ``Kingpin'' and
the new ``There's Something About Mary.''
</P>
<P>
   As you might guess from his credits, Farrelly writes good
locker-room badinage and good one-liners. As you also might guess,
he's considerably less adept when he tries to deal with anything
approaching emotional reality.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike his movies, Farrelly is after more than hearty laughs
here. On some level, he wants us to feel discomfort and, I think, a
grotesque kind of anguish, and it's impossible.
</P>
<P>
   Farrelly's inspiration is clearly Nathanael West's ``The Day of
the Locust'' _ the circle of weirdos in Henry's apartment complex
could be taken as an homage to Todd Hackett's neighbors _ with
maybe a touch of ``The Cable Guy.'' It's a literary marriage made
in hell.
</P>
<P>
   Farrelly continually juxtaposes his fictional small-timers with
very real contemporary eminences, apparently for the sake of
verisimilitude. Henry strikes up a conversation with Robert Redford
in an elevator, tries to strike sparks with Jerry Seinfeld in a
pitch meeting.
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't help either Henry or the novel, and it makes Farrelly
look desperate. West created characters of sufficient believability
that he didn't have to toss in special guest appearances from, say,
Tyrone Power or Jack Warner.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most irritating thing about the book is the sheer
unlikability of its characters. Henry is impossible _ a neurotic, a
hypochondriac, a mope, a loser.
</P>
<P>
   It's like a novel with George Costanza as the leading character.
Even though comedy writers are usually funny only when they're
writing, Henry abuses the privilege.
</P>
<P>
   So you trundle along, forced to satisfy yourself with the
occasional incidental pleasure. Farrelly has a nice line in nasty
patter, half-Shecky Greene, half-Raymond Chandler: ``She was about
forty with Dow Corning breasts and a face the color and texture of
luggage.''
</P>
<P>
   And I like Herb Silverman, Henry's neighbor, whose real name is
Tom Sullivan but who changes his name because he figures he needs
to be Jewish to make it in Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's the big deal?'' he asks Henry. ``Jews are always giving
themselves WASPy names: Jerry Lewis, Winona Ryder, Bob Dylan,
Marvin Davis. Why can't I become a Jew? This is a tough business.
Every little bit helps.''
</P>
<P>
   If only it were that easy for novelists.

 &HT;    A bullet blows away notions of Camelot
 &HT;    By Chris Garcia
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN _ A new, digitally enhanced version of the Zapruder film
was released last week on video. Surprise, surprise, people are
getting all nutty about it.
</P>
<P>
   Here's what won't happen: People will not hold viewing parties
where spicy chicken wings are served on paper plates with ranch
dressing. Video stores won't display the tape on the ``death
films'' shelf, around which acne-dappled boys in Pantera T-shirts
debate if car wrecks or Asian tribal rituals afford the most gore.
We'll be at work on Monday; the nation will not mourn all over
again.
</P>
<P>
   Here's what will happen: Viewers will learn a little bit about
Abraham Zapruder, a 60ish dress-maker who looked remarkablylike
Donald Pleasance and whose words were creased by a faint Russian
accent. They will learn that he required his assistant, Marilyn
Sitzman, to stabilize him as he shot the home movie, because he was
standing on a block of cement and suffered vertigo. They will see a
'60s news anchor suck a real cigarette on the air and witness the
large bird sculpture that was Geraldo Rivera's hair in the '70s.
They will also hear the blow-by-blow story of what Zapruder did
with the film moments and days after the assassination. (``Irwin,
it was terrible,'' he told a co-worker minutes later. ``I saw his
head come off.'')
</P>
<P>
   And you will see the President's head come off.
</P>
<P>
   For a history buff (not a conspiracy buff) like myself, the
enhanced Zapruder film makes great viewing. It's scary, horrifying,
sickening. Good film extracts those reactions from us. Real life
does it even better. This is both.
</P>
<P>
   Like the wincingly raw Rodney King tape, this is important,
life-altering viewing. If you want to see another wedge of life's
bitter pie and know just a little more about what this crazy world
is all about, it's all there. Two thumbs up. Four stars. The
feel-bad movie of the century.
</P>
<P>
   Inevitably, questionable marketing tactics are being deployed to
hawk the tape, which has just been released on VHS and comes out on
DVD next week. But when is marketing, once perfected by a man named
Goebbels, ever truly tasteful?
</P>
<P>
   The company releasing the Zapruder tape, MPI Home Video, bills
the new computer-enhanced version as a solid research tool. Hooey.
There's nothing new offered in the way of unriddling the event's
imposing mystery. No shadowy figures on the neatly mowed knoll, no
fuzzy shots of Bigfoot passing in the distance.
</P>
<P>
   What's new is the red. What's new is seeing how much destruction
a single bullet can wreak on the human head. What's new, what's
stunning and breathtaking and belly-twisting, is seeing a huge
crater of pink hamburger materialize where dark hair once was on
President Kennedy's head.
</P>
<P>
   And with that image, our dewy-eyed notions of the assassination,
especially for those of us born well after the tragedy, are
instantly ripped clean of romance, glamor and comfortable
historical distance. Blam. The inflexible truth of what
``assassination'' means rushes forward to poke us in the eye. To
watch Kennedy slump forward, so catastrophically disfigured and
ruined, nearly blots out all the idyllic photos of Camelot that
came before.
</P>
<P>
   It is important not to confuse emotional arousal for
entertainment. There's too much heft here for the Zapruder footage
to be used solely for a prurient charge. Accusations of voyeurism
fail miserably. That's what people do; we watch.
</P>
<P>
   The Zapruder film is like the famous footage showing the
Hindenburg's gaseous demise. Thirty-six people were incinerated and
a man cried ``Oh, the humanity.'' Transformative movie watching
doesn't get better. Chris Garcia is the film critic for the Austin
American-Statesman

 &HT;    Quake damaged basilica preserved in beautiful book
 &HT;    By Scott Eyman
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH _ If you have tears, prepare to shed them now.
</P>
<P>
   Ghigo Roli had just finished photographing the Basilica of St.
Francis of Assisi when the initial earthquake struck that, a few
days later, resulted in the collapse of sections of the dome.
Destroyed were irreplaceable frescoes by Florentine painters Giotto
and Cimabue.
</P>
<P>
   Abrams has published ``The Basilica of St. Francis of Assisi:
Glory and Destruction'' ($24.95), a book that will now serve as an
epitaph for one of the most beautiful artworks of the Western
world.
</P>
<P>
   I've never been to Assisi, but what is amazing about the
frescoes, aside from their quality, is their condition _ gorgeous,
vivid colors, beautifully preserved.
</P>
<P>
   For each photograph, the book prints a diagram of its place in
the overall cathedral and denotes what parts, if any, were
destroyed. Also published are some shots of the cathedral as it
stands today and images from some video that was being shot as the
ceiling came down, killing four _ two friars and two art experts
who were examining the structure for damage from the first quake.
</P>
<P>
   A must-have for art historians of any stripe.
</P>
<P>
   ON THE CONTINENT . . . During a recent trip to England, I
noticed the offerings of a new company called Pushkin Press. Their
initial list encompasses four short novels (by Raymond Radiguet,
Arthur Schnitzler, Stefan Zweig and Louis Couperus, whoever he is.)
</P>
<P>
   They're small-format paperbacks on excellent paper, a pleasure
to hold and read. Next up is a series of titles inspired by Venice,
including a selection of letters by Henry James. Pushkin is looking
for a U.S. distributor. May they find one in a hurry.
</P>
<P>
   MAYBE HE WAS DRINKING ROGAINE . . . Bison Books, an imprint of
the University of Nebraska Press, one of the most innovative
college presses, tends to reprint lots of valuable books on the
subjects of the Old West and baseball. But now they're branching
out.
</P>
<P>
   They've issued Robert Louis Stevenson's ``The Strange Case of
Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde'' in a tidy little paperback. This is the
edition that originally came out in 1990, with a dozen woodcut
illustrations by Barry Moser and an introduction by Joyce Carol
Oates.
</P>
<P>
   A nice package for $10.

 &HT;    Strip joint jargon
 &HT;    Sidebar to LIVE-NUDE
 &HT;    By Jeff Houck
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   As in any business, those in the adult entertainment industry
have a sort of shorthand for various aspects of their work. Author
J.P. Danko gives us a peek in his book Live Nude Girls:
</P>
<P>
   STRIPPER RADAR _ An imagined sixth sense by which stripteasers
are capable of spotting a patron willing to spend money.
</P>
<P>
   DODGING THE OCTOPUS _ Avoiding the groping hands of an
overzealous customer. Appropriate contact includes a casual
touching of a dancer's arm, shoulder or hand, or sometimes a slight
hug or peck on the cheek. Anything else is out of bounds.
</P>
<P>
   LAP DANCE _ A private performance by dancer for patron. Also
known as a `friction dance' or `Texas-style couch dance.'
</P>
<P>
   THE GAZE _ A cross between lobotomized idiocy, transcendent
bliss and solemn practical appraisal, the fixed gaze is the
countenance on the face of every patron enjoying a lap dance.
</P>
<P>
   THE BEER LINE _ A buffer zone designated by a local legislative
body that separates nude dancers from beer-chugging patrons. The
line may be an actual white stripe placed around the stage.
</P>
<P>
   FUNNY MONEY _ Fake bills issued by a club and obtained by
customers via credit card. Such a practice allows a customer to
have a good time, knowing that the credit-card bill will show a
name other than that of a strip club.
</P>
<P>
   SHOWER OF BILLS _ This classy tipping practice involves a
handful of bills, usually no less than a dozen singles. The patron
approaches the stage and, with a flick of the wrist and an
open-handed release, tosses the bills into the air to flutter about
like wind-borne leaves. He appears aloof about the dough he's
tossed.

 &HT;    (backslash)plashy rides, tales of whale love await you at Sea
World
 &HT;    By Gregory Kallenberg
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO, Texas _ The Great WhiteSea World Where: San Antonio
Texas. Directions: I-35 South to FM 1604 West Hours: 10 a.m. to 10
p.m. through Aug. 9; (fall hours vary so check with the park before
you visit) How much: One day pass costs $30.95 for adults (12 or
older), $20.95 for children (3-11), children 2 and younger are free
Info: (210) 523-3606 or www.SeaWorld.org
</P>
<P>
   It's hot, but the summer movies have been so bad this year that
it's not worth cooling off in a theater, the malls are an
air-conditioned bore and ice skating, no matter how cold the ice,
is for wimps. So where can you go to cool off and simultaneously be
entertained? I suggest you take the trip to Sea World in San
Antonio, Texas. As Sea World's name reflects, everything in the
park has to do with the sea, water or something in the water or
something wet, so if you are not into any of these things or not
aquatic in the least, this might not be the right place for you.
</P>
<P>
   For about $45 (entrance fee and food money), a bathing suit (to
swim in or to wear around the park) and sunglasses (to look cool)
you can have a fun-filled afternoon and keep out of the heat in the
process. Although your day at Sea World can start as early as 10
a.m. when the park opens, I suggest a later arrival time. In this
way, you catch the lag between the parental dawn patrol dragging
their screaming, funnel cake-eating kids and the screaming,
high-school, funnel cake-eating teens with their season passes who
tend to arrive about 3:30 p.m. A well-planned trip can avoid both
these groups, thus rendering the day devoid of lines and, most
importantly, noise-induced headaches.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, plan to arrive about 1:30 p.m. Warning: It will be
hot, so immediately put on that suit and head to the ``Lost
Lagoon.'' This is the water park within Sea World that features two
body slides and two tubing slides. There is also a wave pool and
faux beach where you can hang out. While in the Lagoon, a fun thing
to do is stand by the alligator pool and say, ``Has anyone seen my
little boy? Last time I saw him, he crawled over the fence.''
</P>
<P>
   At 3:30 p.m., head to the Water Ski Stadium for the first of
your shows, ``The Intensity Games.'' This is a land and sea show
that is part competition, part drama. Think: ESPN ``X-Games'' meets
a really good episode of ``American Gladiator.'' The next show to
see is at Sea Lion Stadium at 4:30 p.m. This show proved once and
for all to me that seals and other furry water mammals are funny.
``The Pirates of the Pinniped'' is a goofy, slapstick story of an
evil captain with a seal and an otter saving the day. It might
sound dumb, but so did the movie ``Andre the Seal'' and that was
funny, right?
</P>
<P>
   After the seal takes care of the evil captain and the otter
dances around with a Pepsi can (product placement subtly
infiltrates the park at every turn), head for the Clydesdales. If
you didn't already know, Anheuser-Busch owns the park, yet the
company is pretty classy in its self-promotion. You have to look
pretty hard to find a beer stand or a Budweiser T-shirt (which can
be found in the gift shops for $14.99).
</P>
<P>
   At 5:30 p.m., head to the Shamu Stadium (where, happily, there
is a beer stand) to see the show that features the sea-faring
mammal with enough clout to have a Southwest Airline plane
fashioned after it. The new ``Shamu's Splashin' Sensations'' begins
at 5:30. If, at this point, you're hot, I suggest you sit in the
front nine rows which, conveniently, are labeled the ``Splash
Zone.'' For the truly cocky, I suggest taking a place under the
announcer's stand.
</P>
<P>
   Sea World touts itself as ``educating through entertainment.''
The Shamu show, in all its fun and majesty, does just that. Did you
know, for example, a killer whale is part of the dolphin family?
After hearing just about as much as you would ever want to hear
about killer whale those ``crazy river'' rides intended only to get
you wet. I shared a ``boat'' with a family of three who outweighed
me six to one. ``Weight is a factor on this ride,'' explained the
well-fed father in the Dallas Cowboys tank top. The family had been
there all day and had figured out the physics of ``Rio Loco'' after
riding it four times.
</P>
<P>
   He was right and, with his deft touch, he showed me the funny
art of getting the skinny guy wet. After thanking them for the
lesson and promising I would ``get the next guy,'' I headed to
``The Great White,'' the only ``inverted'' steel coaster in Texas
(where your feet are dangling). As I was being strapped in, the
attendant told me to secure loose items. ``Why?'' ``Because you go
upside down twice,'' he answered. After the fifth loop, pulling
about 4.6 G's, I realized he'd lied. Was it scary? Let me just say,
it was a good thing my pants were already wet.
</P>
<P>
   When you get off ``The Great White'' be sure to check out the
picture they take of you in mid-fright. It's pretty hard to look
cool (even with those sunglasses on) while being mercilessly
whipped around at 50 mph.
</P>
<P>
   Now would be the time to either eat, if you have the stomach for
it, or check out the dolphin pool and Shark/Cor al Reef exhibit. If
you choose the former, there is the Skiside Cafe, which offers
``famous fried chicken'' ($4.95 with fries). For the more formal
dining experience, The Oaks Cafe for a pepperoni pizza ($3.99 with
fries).
</P>
<P>
   For the weaker stomachs, the dolphin pool provides a calming
experience. Here, the dolphins, which you can pet, swim right out
of your reach, unless you have a fish in your hand. The Shark/Cor
al Reef exhibit is an ice-cold air-conditioned aquarium which, if
nothing else, will make you glad you don't have to hang out in a
tank with sharks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clyde and Seamore's Comedy Cruise,'' at the Sea Lion Stadium
at 8 p.m., might be a goofy name for a show, but, as said before,
seals are funny. This show is great because it parodies everything
you've seen so far, from the heartfelt stories told by Shamu's
trainers to the sharing of bird knowledge at ``Birds of a
Feather.'' And, of course, it's all done with Clyde the seal and
his otter and walrus friends.
</P>
<P>
   If by this point, you're sick of watching aquatic animals do
really cute stuff, you're in luck. The night ends with the new
``Red Bright and Blue'' fireworks and laser extravaganza (Waterski
Stadium at 9:40 p.m.). After a puppet Shamu uses his Southwestern
Bell cell phone (again with the product placement) to start the
show, fireworks, lasers and images projected into a water wall will
delight. The 3-D glasses are a must and they're free, so bring your
friends home a pair.
</P>
<P>
   A full day of watching, riding, eating and sliding at Sea World
can stop even the biggest heat whiner from complaining. Instead,
you'll leave with an everlasting memory of the day you were kept
cool by the tail of a whale. I know I did. Shows not to be missed:
</P>
<P>
   There is a lot going on at Sea World, which ultimately leads to
arguments with loved ones over whether to go here or there. One of
the problems with this place is you always feel you're missing
something. So stop the arguing and let me take the blame. Here are
the shows not to be missed while visiting Shamu's home: Shamu's
Splashin' Sensations _ How can you go wrong with Shamu, the star of
Sea World? After the weepy, heartfelt stories told by Shamu's
trainers from kayaks (Why kayaks? Your guess is as good as mine.),
you are treated to a close-up view of the truly majestic animals.
Watch as they swim, jump and drench their sub-superior human
audience.
</P>
<P>
   Symphony of the Sea _ When I went to this show it revolved
around watching the new baby dolphin get aquainted with its mother
and hearing a lecture on the earth's smartest mammals. According to
reliable sources, on a normal day, this is one of the best shows at
Sea World. It features the amazing acrobatics of dolphins and
beluga whales.
</P>
<P>
   Clyde and Seamore's Comedy Cruise Show _ This show works on two
levels: the goofy slapstick level kids love and a truly satirical
level that you'll love. The Comedy Cruise Show questions and makes
fun of all the goofiness and aquatic animal education overplay
you've been experiencing the entire day. Example: A man comes out
wearing a kayak (like the one in the Shamu show). ``You might ask
yourself why, during a Shamu show, am I riding in a kayak? (comic
pause) I have no idea.'' Red Bright and Blue _ If you can endure
the shameless use of product placement in the form of an oversize
cell phone (as a puppet Shamu starts the show), this is a pretty
darned impressive ending to the evening. Fireworks, lasers and a
very cool projection of film on a gushing wall of water.

 &HT;    The few -- the proud -- the cliched
 &HT;    By Palm Beach Post staffwriters
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Steven Spielberg has brought back a long-lost genre - the World
War II movie.
</P>
<P>
   Saving Private Ryan is the story of a GI squad sent in to save a
young private whose three brothers have already been killed in
battle (shades of The Fighting Sullivans). It's described as
unflinchingly realistic in depicting the bloody D-Day battle at
Normandy. But listen up, soldier. A World War II movie is still a
World War II movie. And that means we're going to meet that
familiar platoon: young, scared, ethnically balanced.
</P>
<P>
   And cliched.
</P>
<P>
   THE SERGEANT
</P>
<P>
   Cliches: Always called `Sarge.' Tough. Whips the raw recruits
into men. Often dies in the big battle, but the spirit of the
platoon lives on.
</P>
<P>
   Best movie Sarges: John Wayne in The Sands of Iwo Jima, Robert
Mitchum in The Story of G.I. Joe, Lee Marvin in The Big Red One.
</P>
<P>
   Spielberg's sarge: Sergeant Horvath (Tom Sizemore). Known,
naturally, as Sarge. Has one goal: get his men out alive. THE FARM
BOY
</P>
<P>
   Cliches: Hayseed, baby-faced private. Sure to get killed after
one scene that establishes his decency and naivete.
</P>
<P>
   Best movie farm boy: Richard Jaeckel in Guadalcanal Diary,
Richard Jaeckel in The Sands of Iwo Jima, Richard Jaeckel in
Attack.
</P>
<P>
   Spielberg's farm boy: Private Jackson (Barry Pepper), a
Bible-spouting dead shot from Tennessee. Has he heard of Alvin
York? THE GUY FROM BROOKLYN
</P>
<P>
   Cliches: Wisecracker. Looking out for Number One. Hides horror
through humor. Usually Italian. Can be interchanged with a Jew from
a different borough. Talks about the Dodgers (Brooklyn), mom's
spaghetti, and stickball.
</P>
<P>
   Best movie guy from Brooklyn: Sam Levene in The Purple Heart
</P>
<P>
   Spielberg's guys: Private Reiben (Edward Burns), who won't let
up about how thrilled he is to be saving Private Ryan. Or Private
Mellish (Adam Goldberg), the Jewish kid from Yonkers who knows why
he's fighting the Nazis.
</P>
<P>
   SOME THOUGHTS ON WAR FROM GEN. GEORGE C. SCOTT.
</P>
<P>
   OOPS, WE MEAN PATTON.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``I want you to remember that no bastard ever won a war by
dying for his country. He won it by making the other poor dumb
bastard die for his country.''
</P>
<P>
   _ ``When you put your hand into a bunch of goo that a moment
before was your best friend's face, you'll know what to do.''
</P>
<P>
   _ ``I don't want to get any messages saying that we are holding
our position. We're not holding anything. Let the Hun do that.''
</P>
<P>
   _ ``I love it. God help me, I do love it so. I love it more than
my life.''
</P>
<P>
   THE BEST WWII COMBAT MOVIES
</P>
<P>
   _ ``The Story of G.I. Joe'' (1945) Long unseen because of legal
problems, this William Wellman movie is based on war correspondent
Ernie Pyle's stories of men in battle. The movie made Robert
Mitchum a star.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``They Were Expendable'' (1945) John Ford's melancholy movie
about the development of PT boats for use in the Philippines during
the early days of the war _ a campaign we lost.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Battleground'' (1949) Wellman, a veteran of World War I,
knew what war felt like and in this movie captures the Battle of
the Bulge. The inspiration for some war scenes in ``Saving Private
Ryan.''
</P>
<P>
   _ ``The Big Red One'' (1980) Sam Fuller's last film documents an
infantry platoon and the battle-hardened sarge who leads them. Lee
Marvin's last great role.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Das Boot'' (1981) Wolfgang Petersen's gripping tale from the
other side, about the claustrophobia and futility that builds
during a German U-Boat's mission undersea.
</P>
<P>
   Others: ``The Longest Day,'' ``12 O'Clock High,'' ``The Sands of
Iwo Jima.''
</P>
<P>
   Other films touch on different aspects of the war:
</P>
<P>
   THE POW MOVIE
</P>
<P>
   ``The Bridge on the River Kwai'' (1957) David Lean's masterpiece
about British soldiers in a Japanese prison camp who are forced to
build a bridge. Better than ``Lawrence of Arabia'' because it has a
story.
</P>
<P>
   Others: ``The Great Escape,'' ``King Rat,'' ``Stalag 17.''
</P>
<P>
   THE HOMEFRONT MOVIE
</P>
<P>
   ``The Best Years of Our Lives'' (1946) William Wyler's moving
portrait of veterans coming home to uncertain futures, amazingly
mature after more than 50 years.
</P>
<P>
   Others: ``Since You Went Away,'' ``Swing Shift.''
</P>
<P>
   THE HOLOCAUST MOVIE
</P>
<P>
   ``Schindler's List'' (1993) Not a perfect movie, but a deeply
moving one from Spielberg about a German who saves more than 1,000
Polish Jews. ``The list is life.''
</P>
<P>
   Others: ``Shoah,'' ``The Sorrow and the Pity,'' ''Night and
Fog.''
</P>
<P>
   THE WAR COMEDY
</P>
<P>
   ''To Be Or Not To Be'' (1942) Ernst Lubitsch's black comedy
about incompetent Polish actors pretending to be vicious Nazis to
escape their clutches. A masterpiece, with Jack Benny as ``that
great, great Polish actor, Joseph Tura'' and the luminous Carole
Lombard as his wife.
</P>
<P>
   Others: ``The Miracle of Morgan's Creek,'' ``The Great
Dictator.''
</P>
<P>
   TORA! TORA! BORE-A!
</P>
<P>
   THE WORST WORLD WAR II MOVIES
</P>
<P>
   _ Tora, Tora, Tora.
</P>
<P>
   _ Midway.
</P>
<P>
   _ In Harm's Way
</P>
<P>
   _ Or anything with Audie Murphy, Charlie Chan or Tarzan fighting
the ``Nadzies.''
</P>
<P>
   MOST UNLIKELY MOVIE DOGFACES
</P>
<P>
   _ Joey Bishop in The Naked and The Dead.
</P>
<P>
   _ William Bendix in Wake Island and Guadalcanal Diary.
</P>
<P>
   _ Bobby Darin and Bob Newhart in Hell is for Heroes.
</P>
<P>
   HOLLYWOOD'S TRUE-LIFE WAR HEROES
</P>
<P>
   _ WAYNE MORRIS. The B-picture actor was Hollywood's most
decorated soldier, with four Distinguished Flying Crosses and two
Air Medals (Remember, Audie Murphy didn't become an actor till
after the war.) Morris received the credit for sinking three ships
and shooting down seven Japanese planes.
</P>
<P>
   _ JAMES STEWART. He flew about 20 missions as an Air Force
bombing pilot, and was decorated for his service.
</P>
<P>
   _ CLARK GABLE. After the death of wife Carole Lombard while
promoting war bonds, Gable flew with a photography unit on five
risky combat missions and received an Air Medal.
</P>
<P>
   _ DOUGLAS FAIRBANKS, JR. He was decorated for his service under
fire as a Naval officer on the Italian coast.
</P>
<P>
   And let's not forget middle-aged directors like John Ford,
George Stevens and John Huston, who went to war and made great
documentaries while the bullets were flying all around them.
</P>
<P>
   HOLLYWOOD'S BIGGEST WAR SLACKER
</P>
<P>
   JOHN WAYNE. That's right, the Duke dodged the war, churning out
so many patriotic-themed movies that some think he single-handedly
won the war. But he was more worried about his career, and with a
family-support deferment, he never got around to enlisting.
</P>
<P>
   OVER THE RIDGE
</P>
<P>
   It's a trend. Six movies about World War II are being planned by
Hollywood, including ``The Thin Red Line,'' with Sean Penn, John
Travolta and George Clooney, a film based on James Jones' novel and
directed by the reclusive Terrence Malick, who hasn't been seen
since ``Badlands'' and ``Days of Heaven'' in the 1970s.

 &HT;    Suffering makes me ready for tough nursing home regulation
 &HT;    By Phil Latham
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MARSHALL, Texas _ It has been three years now, almost to the
day, that I walked into a Fort Worth nursing home to see my sister.
</P>
<P>
   For sheer heat, that summer did not match this one, but that
particular day was remarkably hot. It was at least 100 degrees and
probably several degrees
</P>
<P>
   hotter than that.
</P>
<P>
   And when I opened the door to the nursing home I discovered, to
my surprise, that it was almost that warm inside.
</P>
<P>
   The air conditioning had died, not that day but the day before.
The nursing home staff was trying to use a series of small box fans
to keep the place
</P>
<P>
   cool.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't working.
</P>
<P>
   The first thing I noticed was the usual group of elderly folks
gathered around the front door -- all wearing sweaters or long
robes. Sweat streamed
</P>
<P>
   down their faces like tears. They did not know they were
overheating themselves.
</P>
<P>
   I walked around the hall to my sister's room to find her naked,
lying on the bed in a pool of her own vomit. She had dumped a
pitcher of water on her
</P>
<P>
   head in a vain attempt to cool down. Though my sister was only
five years older than me, she was dying and incoherent most of the
time. She likely
</P>
<P>
   also did not know how hot it was in the building.
</P>
<P>
   As I began to search the halls for a nurse -- there were always
too few to do too much work -- one came from behind me. Before I
had a chance to say
</P>
<P>
   anything she said to me:
</P>
<P>
   ``Help us. Call someone. Make them get this fixed. These people
are going to die.''
</P>
<P>
   The urgency in her voice could not be mistaken, though even
standing in that heat I thought she might have been overstating the
danger. I thought
</P>
<P>
   that until I located a thermostat that was pegged out at 90
degrees.
</P>
<P>
   Still, I didn't know who to call. I assumed state offices would
be closed on a Saturday. Being a newsman, I did the best thing I
could think of: I
</P>
<P>
   called the Associated Press. From inside the nursing home I told
an AP reporter what was going on. In just a few hours, she had a
story on the
</P>
<P>
   wire. That set the Fort Worth Star Telegram off to do their own
story.
</P>
<P>
   When contacted by the press, the nursing home owner -- a
corporate outfit from somewhere -- said that they had tried their
hardest to get the air
</P>
<P>
   conditioning fixed but that they could not find a new compressor
to install.
</P>
<P>
   Let me get this straight. In the entire Dallas-Fort Worth area
there was not a compressor to be had? I don't think so. Perhaps
there was none to be
</P>
<P>
   had at the right price, more likely the corporation had a single
supplier of compressors who gave them a cut rate and the
corporation did not want to
</P>
<P>
   spend the extra money.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, one of the employees contacted by the newspaper said
that the system had been not working properly for days before it
finally broke down
</P>
<P>
   completely Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   With both the AP and the Star Telegram hounding them, somebody
did something. By late Sunday the air conditioning had been fixed.
</P>
<P>
   I was not exactly greeted as a hero by the nursing home staff
when I came back on Sunday. The corporate supervisors had come
through with a terrible,
</P>
<P>
   swift sword, threatening anyone who spoke to the media. The
clamps had been installed.
</P>
<P>
   I advised them to get ready, because I intended to complain to
the state agency overseeing nursing homes.
</P>
<P>
   I wonder if they laughed when I walked away.
</P>
<P>
   Because Monday morning, when I called the Texas Department of
Health, division of Long Term Care, it was much as if I was calling
the corporate
</P>
<P>
   offices for the nursing home.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of acting as a watchdog, the person I talked to was more
of an apologist for the nursing home and the industry as a whole.
It took just a
</P>
<P>
   minute to know that I would be getting no action from the state.
Nursing homes across this state must know about the lax treatment.
</P>
<P>
   This is not to say that there are not good nursing homes but, if
one is good, it is not because the state demands it. I cannot tell
that the state
</P>
<P>
   demands much at all. To be sure, there are reams of rules, but
almost none of them, if broken, will result in any real punitive
action against the
</P>
<P>
   nursing home.
</P>
<P>
   Which is why I was interested to hear that President Bill
Clinton wants congress to tighten the rules against nursing homes,
a move that was
</P>
<P>
   welcomed by Sen. Charles Grassley, a Republican from Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the ``other side'' has already fired a first shot. The
Associated Press quoted Dr. Paul Willging, executive vice president
of the American
</P>
<P>
   Health Care Association, which represents 11,000 nursing homes,
thusly: ``Enforcement activity alone is not the answer. In fact, a
single-minded
</P>
<P>
   emphasis on enforcement will ultimately hurt quality.''
</P>
<P>
   At one time I could have laughed at such complete nonsense.
Laughed, had I not seen the people suffering with my own eyes.

 &HT;    Bare facts: West Palm club makes book of best strip joints
 &HT;    Has sidebars: NUDE-SIDE-1, NUDE-SIDE-2
 &HT;    By Jeff Houck
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ If a crazy idea is worth anything in
this world, J.P Danko might just be the Bill Gates of the Crazies.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the fact that he persuaded a book publisher to fork
over a five-figure advance for the sole purpose of finding
America's 100 best strip clubs, including one in Palm Beach County.
</P>
<P>
   Then he persuaded his mom to lend him her 1985 Volkswagen
Vanagon for the 15,000-mile skin excursion.
</P>
<P>
   And he persuaded his girlfriend, Wendy, to continue in that
capacity twice - once before the trip and once after she broke up
with him while he was out on the road.
</P>
<P>
   Men, you owe J.P. Danko a debt of gratitude.
</P>
<P>
   Night after hellish night, for three months he endured a
grueling blur of silicone, skimpy lingerie and surly bouncers, all
so that there might be an authoritative guide to the
highest-quality adult nightclub entertainment our nation has to
offer.
</P>
<P>
   The result: a light-hearted 160-page opus titled Live Nude Girls
($14.95, St. Martin's Press). It's a practical, tongue-in-cheek
book that will bring a smirk or a dirty laugh of recognition to
anyone familiar with so-called gentlemen's clubs.
</P>
<P>
   He toured 31 states (including Hawaii), as well as the District
of Columbia, Quebec, Ontario and Baja California. As Danko sees it,
Florida is the best strip-club state, with 15 institutions ranking
in the top 100. There are 15 from California in the book, too, but
the Sunshine State offers something special.
</P>
<P>
   ``Florida had a great diversity of clubs, and the women were tan
and beautiful, of course,'' Danko said. ``I liked the upscale
clubs, but since I consider myself a populist, I also like going
into a dive bar, if nothing more than for the people-watching. If
you don't have a lot of money, you can go into a dive with a couple
bucks and still have a great time.''
</P>
<P>
   His observations on some South Florida saloons:
</P>
<P>
   Crazy Horse Too, Pompano Beach: ``Purchase a fine cigar from the
gift shop, and while you're there, how about something for the
little lady back home? The black satin jacket is a perfect choice.
Like Vegas lights and South Florida nights, black satin is always
in style.''
</P>
<P>
   Pure Platinum, Fort Lauderdale: ``After the boat show expo - or
whatever lame excuse brought you to town - you and your college
friends can relive the spring break partying days of yore and fall
in love once more with your South Florida dream girl.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mermaid Bar, West Palm Beach: ``A hand-carved mermaid and
old-style wooden fixtures give this joint a classic vibe as groups
of idle dancers sit around talking and smoking like extras on a
swashbuckler flick.''
</P>
<P>
   Owner Charlie Covington, a former bouncer who bought the
Southern Boulevard club in April 1997, laughed with a snort when
told his less-than-glamorous club had made the top 100.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not really a club, we're more of a bar,'' he said. ``We
get all kinds of guys in here - guys in suits, guys in jeans, you
name it. And we've got all kinds of girls, too - little girls next
door, big girls next door, good-looking girls and, let's be honest,
some ugly girls, too. But that's what makes it a bar where anyone
can hang out. There are real people here.''
</P>
<P>
   It's more impressive when you understand that the low-key
Mermaid, which has been open a stone's throw from Palm Beach
International Airport's runway since 1972, beat out such venerable
haunts as T's Lounge in West Palm Beach and Tiffany's Cabaret in
Boynton Beach.
</P>
<P>
   Danko had a range of clubs in mind when he first envisioned his
trek - from flashy to seedy. The idea for the ultimate strip-bar
bible came while he and a friend were visiting a club. Watching the
display, the friend bemoaned the fact that there was no guide to
the best erotic establishments. An unemployed writer at the time,
Danko decided to be the carnal Columbus.
</P>
<P>
   His mother was less than thrilled.
</P>
<P>
   ``She didn't ask too many questions,'' he said. ``After a while,
she really preferred not to know anything. But, given the choice
between unemployment and writing a book about strip clubs, I think
this was the less of two evils.''
</P>
<P>
   Some days he'd drop in on as many as 10 clubs. Most times he'd
go with a friend who was all too happy to tag along in exchange for
free lodging. In Tijuana, Mexico, he saw one buddy propose marriage
to a stripper, while another got into a brawl.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, he drank occasionally. And yes, he tipped the dancers. ``I
learned that in order to be a decent customer you have to tip,'' he
said. ``Not that much, but often.''
</P>
<P>
   The best-looking women worked on the weekends, he said, but
there were no other absolutes. Daytime dancers proved just as
entertaining. ``If you go in off-hours during the day, you get all
the attention, which is good. But if you get all the attention, you
have to pay for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Along the way were some downright weird spectacles.
</P>
<P>
   In Fayetteville, N.C., he watched a veteran stripper teach a
young novice the proper way to work the go-go pole, while two or
three patrons watched the on-the-job training with glazed eyes. At
another club, a patron paid one of the strippers $500 for her
shoes.
</P>
<P>
   In Anniston, Ala., an ambulance pulled up to a club and unloaded
a guy on a stretcher. The attendants propped him up next to the
stage. Standing around the stage was a no-no at that club, but no
one said anything.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe he was on the way to the hospital, I don't know,'' Danko
said. ``I didn't ask.''
</P>
<P>
   The traveling got boring. Going from club to club got boring.
Nursing the ailing Vanagon got a bit tedious.
</P>
<P>
   ``At times, it was tough, and my energy and interest did lag,
but it's remarkable how your interest improves once you're about 10
or 15 feet from a club's door, and you realize you're about to see
dozens of naked women,'' he said. ``Funny how that happens.''

 &HT;    Not all compression ratios created equal
 &HT;    By Nora Carter
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- Ask a guy at work how to charge a battery, and he'll
tell you how it's built and why it works.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes a simple question generates a complicated answer. To
understand the cause and effect of a situation, the ``whys'' need
to be supported by the ``hows'' and ``whats.'' I refuse to teach my
students simply how to fix a particular car problem without
supplying the ``how and why'' it works.
</P>
<P>
   Dave Grossman asked about fuel octane.
</P>
<P>
   ``I purchased a 1998 Buick Regal GS, which has a GM 3800 series
II, supercharged V-6 engine. The manual calls for premium gas. The
same engine without a supercharger uses regular. The salesperson
told me that I could use regular if I didn't have any pinging or
run-on, which I don't. Am I doing the right thing?''
</P>
<P>
   This question actually has a couple of answers. One pertains to
the octane requirements of the vehicle, and the other addresses the
vehicle's response to the lower octane fuel via the engine's
computerized management system. Before I get into the ``whys'' of
octane, let's look inside the engine.
</P>
<P>
   During the intake stroke of a four-stroke piston engine, the
piston is moving downward and the intake valve opens, allowing fuel
and air to enter the cylinder. The intake stroke is followed by the
compression stroke. The intake valve closes, sealing the chamber.
The piston moves upward in the cylinder, compressing the air fuel
mixture.
</P>
<P>
   This is where the term ``compression ratio'' comes from. The
distance between the bottom of the piston travel and the top of its
travel, where the air and fuel are maximum squished, is a ratio. If
the piston is squishing the mixture to one-ninth of the total
distance between top and bottom, the engine is said to have a 9:1
compression ratio; if it compresses to one-twelfth of the volume,
the ratio is 12:1. When the mixture is compressed, it creates heat.
The higher the compression ratio, or the more compressing the
piston has to do, the more heat produced.
</P>
<P>
   The hot, squished, air/fuel mixture then is ignited by the spark
plug. This creates the controlled explosion that pushes the piston
back down on the power stroke, the source of engine momentum. The
exhaust valve opens, and the piston moves upward again, pushing the
(hopefully completely) burned fuel mixture out of the cylinder.
</P>
<P>
   This cycle repeats itself at an incredibly rapid speed. An
example is, a six-cylinder engine running at 3000 rpm must deliver
a spark-ignited power stroke 150 times a second.
</P>
<P>
   Most engines are naturally aspirated, meaning the air entering
the combustion chamber has the same atmospheric pressure as the
outside air, 14.7 pounds per square inch at sea level and less as
elevation increases.
</P>
<P>
   When the piston compresses the air/fuel mixture, the total
volume is limited to what is naturally pushed (and sucked) into the
cylinder.
</P>
<P>
   A supercharger boosts the intake air pressure above atmospheric
pressure, meaning the total volume of the mixture to be compressed
is increased. So, given two engines with compression ratios of 9:1,
a naturally aspirated engine has less squishing to do than one with
boosted air pressure.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the compression ratios are the same, the heat
generated in the combustion chamber of the boosted engine is
higher.
</P>
<P>
   So back to octane. Simply put, an engine's fuel octane
requirement is directly proportional to the amount of heat produced
in the combustion chamber. More on that next week.

 &HT;    Pass the karma, please: Growth comes back to haunt
 &HT;    By Jim Minter
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ With elections just over, I had planned to use this
space for an in-depth analysis of the results. Unfortunately, the
perils of semirural living intervened and that will have to be left
to less astute observers.
</P>
<P>
   Several years ago a real estate lady sold the soybean field
adjacent to our peaceful family farm to a developer. I can't blame
the real estate lady. Actually, she is very nice and was only
trying to supplement her spouse's Social Security check and keep
him up in the style to which he became accustomed when he was
gainfully employed.
</P>
<P>
   Neither can I blame the owners who put the soybean farm up for
sale after their mother died. They had long since moved to Florida
and had been renting the farm for a fee that barely paid taxes.
Getting along in years, they didn't have much choice.
</P>
<P>
   I wish the real estate lady could have found a buyer who would
keep on planting soybeans, or use the land for a cattle farm. But
not many farmers are looking to cultivate crops or raise animals in
Fayette County these day, except for a hobby.
</P>
<P>
   The developer naturally wanted to make a profit on his
investment, and so I can't be too angry with him either, even after
he sent in bulldozers to cut streets and grade lots, stirring up
red mud that silted my pond and ruined the fishing.
</P>
<P>
   The developer then built houses. Real estate persons in cahoots
with the real estate lady who sold the soybean field sold the
houses to city folks, and even some to Yankees. The law being the
way it is, I don't know what can be done about that.
</P>
<P>
   My family has been here since we ran the Indians out. It would
be nice, now that we're rid of Indians, to make it illegal for
anyone to buy land, or build a home, in Fayette County unless their
families have lived here since before the Civil War.
</P>
<P>
   The courts, when pressed, seem to have a different opinion. It
would help if we had a law making it illegal to sell land unless it
is going to be used exactly like our grandfathers used it. I'd like
that, until I got bad sick, or divorced for tracking mud in the
house, and had to have a lot of money.
</P>
<P>
   When we moved to the farm 25 years ago we lived on a dirt road.
The idea of living on a dirt road seemed romantic until we started
doing it. We had to drive the boys to meet the school bus on the
paved road. When it rained, we sometimes got stuck. The car stayed
so dirty my wife was ashamed to go to church unless I got up early
and washed it on Sunday mornings.
</P>
<P>
   The dirt road had its pluses. We didn't have a road sign or a
house number. Friends who lived in Atlanta couldn't find us and my
wife couldn't call Neiman-Marcus and Saks to have things FedExed.
When I jogged, my knees didn't hurt. We didn't have to worry about
the cows getting out of the pasture and into the road. I could go
to the mailbox without being nearly run down by a speeding yuppie.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, I made weekly trips to the courthouse to complain
about mud holes and dust. The commissioners eventually agreed to
pave our road. After the road was paved, my old-maid cousins were
able to sell their home place across from our house. They had
inherited it, but couldn't pay the taxes until they moved off to
Atlanta and got jobs. They were old and sick and needed the money.
</P>
<P>
   Things have changed since we came back home, first from College
Park to escape jet noise, then hopscotching down the road when
Fayetteville needed a second traffic light to handle all the
immigrant drivers. We're still fairly rural at certain times of
day. At twilight a family of five deer cavort in the driveway,
before sneaking into the garden for a midnight snack.
</P>
<P>
   We saw seven peacocks on an afternoon stroll. Canada geese are
regular visitors, with mallard ducks dropping in now and then.
Other visitors include fox, raccoons, beaver and opossums. Stan
Thain encounters coyotes behind the pond. Our latest campers are
two sets of mama and papa turkeys, 14 offspring between them. With
such a menagerie, it's sad the cows have to go.
</P>
<P>
   I was peacefully tending the charcoal grill under an oak tree in
the back yard when a subdivision neighbor drove up, slightly irate.
Our cows were in his back yard. Again.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, they aren't my cows. They're my semi-farmer son's
cows. Since the courts have been leaning toward holding parents
responsible for offspring actions and inactions, I canceled supper
and paged our semi-farmer son. The 11 o'clock news had finished
showing dead bodies and interviewing witnesses in tank tops when we
finally got the cows back home with the help of Sid Drake, a
neighbor who understands cow emergencies. Sid's grandpa was Mr.
Dewitt Oakley, who tended a herd until he died last year, in his
90s.
</P>
<P>
   Until somebody figures out a way to keep trees from falling on
fences, there's no fool-proof way to keep cows, or goats, in a
pasture. In the old days, Mr. Oakley would drop by in his pickup to
tell you your cows were out and that he had run them into his barn
until you had time to come get them. Subdivision neighbors don't
have barns, and couldn't herd cows into one if they did.
</P>
<P>
   Our semi-farmer son will soon be making a trip to Jackson, where
they sell cows to packing houses on days they don't have anything
going in the electric chair. Somewhere in the Happy Hunting Ground
Indians are laughing.

 &HT;    Strippers' favorite? The rolodex guy
 &HT;    Sidebar to LIVE-NUDE
 &HT;    By Jeff Houck
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Patrons at adult entertainment clubs fall neatly into several
categories, according to author J.P. Danko.
</P>
<P>
   THE FRAT BOYS _ Identifiable for three reasons: They're young,
they're obnoxious, and they travel in packs. Frat Boys tend to
fancy themselves too cool to be spending time in a strip club. They
try to flirt with the girls without spending money, wrongly
believing the strippers will respect them more if they don't spend.
</P>
<P>
   THE REGULAR _ A nightly visitor, he takes his usual seat at the
club. Everyone knows his name, his favorite drink and his favorite
dancer, although he usually sits at the bar and doesn't spend much.
</P>
<P>
   THE ANTI-TIPPER _ Remains aloof and tips only to reward what he
considers a very special or exceptional talent.
</P>
<P>
   THE BOYFRIEND _ Drops by his local bar now and again to visit
friends and keep an eye on his main squeeze. Everyone knows him, so
he's not pestered about tipping. He's ``stripper-friendly'' and is
probably just killing time between rolling out of bed and heading
off to band practice. On occasion, he drinks too much and gets
paranoid, worrying that his girlfriend is getting overly intimate
with her clientele.
</P>
<P>
   THE RACE FANS _ Largely a Southern phenomenon, this group of
verbally expressive, beer-guzzling, car-crazed rowdies floods strip
clubs wherever the NASCAR racing circuit takes them. They don't
make much money, but they tend to spend all they have.
</P>
<P>
   THE ROLODEX GUY _ Usually buys a private dance from each girl
and, when the dance is over, moves on to the next one. Not one to
engage in small talk, the Rolodex Guy is a dancer favorite because
he spreads a lot of cash around to everyone.
</P>
<P>
   THE COOL GUY _ Usually young, handsome and self-assured, the
Cool Guy enters a strip club with one goal: to leave with a
stripper. He lavishes money and charm. One problem: Dancers shed
their skivvies to make money, not bump into prospective partners,
so Cool Guy rarely has any luck.
</P>
<P>
   THE WET BLANKET _ Doesn't want to be there, but as a part of a
larger group of guys, he had little choice. The idea of spending
money with no possibility of tangible return drives him absolutely
nuts, so he scowls, behaves rudely and refuses to pitch in.
</P>
<P>
   THE SENSITIVE GUY _ Seeks to justify his presence by engaging a
dancer in a lengthy, heartfelt conversation, attempting to convince
her that he views her as a real person _ not as a sex symbol _ and
isn't like the other customers (Read: he doesn't tip). He goes
after her real name, where she's from and how she got into the
business, but from the dancer's perspective, he's the worst
customer, since he talks too much, doesn't spend money and insists
on dwelling on a topic she either isn't interested in or long ago
laid to rest.

 &HT;    Cars like TDI Jetta deserve a second look
 &HT;    By Linda Sharp
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- Bob and Tony are in sales, and they travel a great
deal. Bob normally drives an extended-cab four-wheel-drive pickup,
Tony a two-door sport-utility vehicle. Both are pretty big men.
</P>
<P>
   Recently their boss told them they would be taking an extended
sales trip together. Their route would take them from Atlanta to
Davenport, Iowa, on to Minneapolis and then back to Atlanta. To
make their trip more pleasurable, he was providing them with the
newest company vehicle, a Volkswagen TDI Jetta.
</P>
<P>
   These two burly types would be taking an almost 3,000-mile trip
in a Volkswagen -- with a diesel engine, no less. Their boss
assured them the VW would be up to the task.
</P>
<P>
   Bob and Tony approached their new ride with more than just a bit
of skepticism. Before them sat what appeared to be a small
four-door econobox. They said, ``We'll get out of this. There's no
way we will ever get all our supplies in this little car.''
</P>
<P>
   Then they opened the cavernous trunk. Not only did it hold all
their product and luggage, they actually tossed in a couple of golf
bags, just in case. To their surprise, they found the front seat
area to be more than ample for their full figures.
</P>
<P>
   All they had left to complain about was the Jetta's diesel
engine.
</P>
<P>
   Bob barked, ``With all this stuff and us, this thing will
probably never get over Monteagle outside of Chattanooga.''
</P>
<P>
   Reports are that not only did the Jetta scale Monteagle, it did
it in excess of the speed limit.
</P>
<P>
   Their trip was just over 3,200 miles, but their total fuel bill
was just under $75. The accounting department actually questioned
the correctness of their mileage.
</P>
<P>
   If you are a commuter who travels 50 miles a day, gets an
average of 20 mpg at an average price of $1 per gallon, your annual
fuel cost would be $650. The Jetta TDI averaged about 48 mpg on
Tony and Bob's trip. The annual fuel cost on the TDI-equipped Jetta
would be only about $270. With a range of more than 600 miles per
tankful, you would probably only have to fill up every two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Diesel engines are standard fare in European markets, where fuel
often costs more than $3.50 per gallon.
</P>
<P>
   Americans are still in the learning process about diesels. VW's
TDI is one of the best around. No noise, no smoke and, because of
turbocharging, great acceleration. Another big benefit is they
produce 20 percent less carbon dioxide than a gasoline motor.
</P>
<P>
   One look at Atlanta or any other metropolitan area's skyline on
a muggy summer day, many commuters may agree the diesel's time may
have come.

 &HT;    Test Drive: From staid to stylish
 &HT;    By Russ DeVault
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- Mergers, acquisitions, retro cars such as the
Volkswagen Beetle and the popularity of massive vehicles such as
the Lincoln Navigator have made for strange times in the auto
industry. To even casual observers, however, nothing seems stranger
than the idea of staid, safety-oriented Volvo introducing certified
head-turning cars.
</P>
<P>
   But that's the way it is with the Volvo C70 coupe and
convertible, a pair of Swedish-built vehicles best considered safe,
swift, good-looking and pricey. The look-at-that quotient --
particularly among Volvo loyalists -- rivals that of the new VW
Beetle. Oddly, though, the coupe provoked more questions, grins and
thumbs up.
</P>
<P>
   Equally unusual is that their prices shocked neither teens,
senior citizens nor those in between who are the target market for
the sporty C70 models. The coupe, available now, is base-priced at
$39,970, while the topless version is expected to list for about
$43,000 when it begins arriving in showrooms in August.
</P>
<P>
   Both are likely to delight the Volvo faithful, although it'll be
interesting to see how many new buyers spring for the 3,000 or so
C70s Volvo plans to sell in the United States. Volvo hopes
newcomers will be impressed by the array of standard features,
which include nifty leather-and-walnut trim, a dash-mounted
three-disc CD player, trip computer, power/manual driver's seat
with memory, convenient console-mounted drink holders that really
grip, and power locks and windows.
</P>
<P>
   Both C70s slip smoothly into the fun-driver category, because of
accurate rack-and-pinon steering, nicely taut suspensions, strong
brakes and enough power to make it seem they're carrying highly
developed six-cylinder engines rather than turbocharged
five-bangers.
</P>
<P>
   Volvo's ``light-pressure'' 2.4-liter engine makes 190 horsepower
and 199 pounds-feet of torque, while the 2.3 whomps out 236 hp with
243 pounds-feet of torque. The horsepower doesn't peak until the
rpms hit the 5,000 level, but the torque comes on nicely -- once
the turbo is going -- in the 2,000 rpm range, giving the
3,500-pound C70s 0-to-60-mph times in the eight-second bracket.
</P>
<P>
   The interior features a layout easily recognized as Volvo, as is
the exterior, with its traditional square-V design front and grille
with the slash mark Volvo logo. There are few sharp angles on the
exterior, which is rounded and aerodynamic enough for the
convertible to be shockingly quiet, but not turbulence-free at
speed with the top down.
</P>
<P>
   The power top with its glass rear window is another one of those
mechanical marvels, lowering and hiding itself and vice versa in
less than 30 seconds, although it's best not to think about the
complex hand-cranking that must be done if it fails.
</P>
<P>
   Rear-quarter visibility isn't bad in the coupe but is as poor as
expected in the convertible when the top's up. That's about all
that will disconcert drivers of either, unless it's the little
uncertainty the four-speed automatic develops when slow-and-go
traffic leads to turbo-on, turbo-off motoring.
</P>
<P>
   The fit and finish of both models was up to Volvo's usual
standards, although the plastic bubble covering a clump of
electronic gear at the center front edge of the convertible top
needs better anchors than the non-working snap-ons on the
early-built tester.
</P>
<P>
   Audiophiles will love the powerful three-channel surround sound
stereo with its in-dash three-disc changer; others may feel the
surround speaker on the top center of the dash spoils what's
otherwise a reasonably graceful, but marginally over-engineered
packaging of controls and instrumentation. The turn signals on both
the saffron coupe and the light blue convertible were unduly lax
about canceling, but -- like the convertible's lack of top-up
visibility -- driver adaptability lessens the aggravation.
</P>
<P>
   Offsetting pluses include rear seats that accept adults who
don't mind compromised legroom, the expected durability of Volvo's
vehicles and the overall appeal of a sporty coupe/convert-
</P>
<P>
   ible that is foremost devoted to occupant safety.

 &HT;    Versatile dremel tool's many uses praised
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ I come to sing the praises of a tool more often
considered hobbyist equipment than a serious woodworking implement.
</P>
<P>
   It is the Dremel tool, the little hand-held rotary grinder that
used to be called the Moto-Tool, but has more recently been renamed
the MultiPro. It is, in many respects, the WD-40 of tools.
</P>
<P>
   With a little imagination, you can do an amazing number of
things with it.
</P>
<P>
   I've had my Moto-Tool for so long I can't remember when or why I
first acquired it. It was certainly long before I got into
woodworking.
</P>
<P>
   I first used it in woodworking when I was going out of my mind
trying to get hinges installed properly on jewelry boxes. I was not
adept enough with chisels to get the mortises flat and at the right
depth.
</P>
<P>
   I must have read somewhere that Dremel made a router base for
the tool. I rushed out and bought it, along with a couple of
flat-bottom router bits.
</P>
<P>
   I suppose one could use a laminate-trimming router for the same
thing, but even that tool would be a little large. My old
single-speed Moto-Tool, mounted in the simple little router base,
did fine. It's powerful enough to do the job, but not powerful
enough to get away from you -- and small enough so you can see what
you're doing well enough to freehand most of the work.
</P>
<P>
   Recently I acquired one of the new variable-speed MultiPro
tools, which has five steps from 5,000 to 30,000 rpm.
</P>
<P>
   My first serious use of this tool was more in the line of home
repair than woodworking. At my daughter's house, my granddaughter
Alyson's bedroom door was suffering from seasonal problems and
wouldn't stay closed. The young lady understandably wanted it
fixed.
</P>
<P>
   Upon examination, it became apparent that the bottom of the
latch was running perhaps 1/8 inch below the escutcheon covering
the door jamb. In common terms (I don't know the technical ones)
the latch wasn't going into the hole, and thus the door kept
falling open.
</P>
<P>
   There are several possible solutions to this, most of them
absurd, but being of a rather ponderous mind in such matters I ran
through all of them.
</P>
<P>
   I could take the door off the hinges and adjust its hanging. I
could move down the whatcha-macallit on the door jamb. I didn't
think I could move the door knob and latch assembly, however.
</P>
<P>
   Since the mismatch was so small, all of these solutions, in
addition to being a lot of work, seemed rather overdone.
</P>
<P>
   Why not simply lower the hole in the wood and extend the
matching escutcheon hole to match?
</P>
<P>
   Elementary. I brought over my new Dremel tool, attached one of
the small grinders that came with it, and ground about 1/8 inch off
the bottom of the metal escutcheon hole. Then I substituted one of
the sanding drums and cleaned out the wood behind it. The door shut
nicely. It took about five minutes.
</P>
<P>
   I see now that in addition to the router base, Dremel has a
little router table available for the tool, along with a drill
press attachment and a flexible shaft.
</P>
<P>
   There is a little end cap guide you can get along with the
appropriate tools for making cutouts in drywall and ceiling tile,
and cutting wall tile into shapes to fit around various fixtures.
</P>
<P>
   The cutoff wheels are also very useful; I first used these to
cut track when I was a model railroader. They're also mighty useful
for cutting down, or cutting off, bolts that are too long, or whose
nuts are rusted. Much easier than a hacksaw.
</P>
<P>
   The original point of the tool, probably, was grinding,
sharpening, sanding and polishing. Dremel has a bewildering array
of grinders, sanders and polishers available in every kind of
material, from diamond to rubber. I've seen jigs for using a Dremel
tool to sharpen saw chains. I'm working myself up to trying a
little gunsmithing with some of the mild polishers.
</P>
<P>
   This is an incredibly useful tool. The problem is to remember
what it can do. Mine came with a very useful booklet called ``175
Uses for the Dremel MultiPro,'' and I can see I've definitely been
underusing mine.

   COMMENTARY: List makers' rank attempt to size century
</P>
<P>
   By Mark Lane
</P>
<P>
   c. Cox News Service
</P>
<P>
   DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. _ As the 20th century winds down, the media
are celebrating by creating new and grander versions of this
century's preeminent literary form -- the list.
</P>
<P>
   With the millennium poised to reset us and our computers to the
Year Zero, we are being bombarded with top-100 lists that pay
homage to the past 98 years and assume nothing much will show up
over the next year and half.
</P>
<P>
   There's the 100 Most Important People of the 20th Century as
pronounced by Time Magazine. There's the America Film Institute's
Top 100 films. TV Guide and Nick at Nite did the 100 Greatest
Television Episodes of All Time. And now, the editorial board of
the Modern Library presents us with the 100 best English-Language
Novels of the 20th Century.
</P>
<P>
   This last list declares James Joyce the boss, the maximum
mack-daddy of 20th century letters and settles an old score by
pronouncing F. Scott Fitzgerald a better writer than Ernest
Hemingway.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it's just me, but I believe Papa Hemingway was robbed. His
only work to make the list was the ``The Sun Also Rises'' and even
that work rated a paltry 45th place. That's only 10 places above
the badly aging beatnik speed-typing of Jack Kerouac's cult-novel
``On the Road.'' It's three big steps below James Dickey's
``Deliverance.''
</P>
<P>
   Harsh.
</P>
<P>
   Let it merely be noted in passing that Joyce, Dickey, Kerouac or
Fitzgerald do not inspire look-alike contests anywhere in Florida.
And for sheer number of bad imitators, not even Kerouac comes
close.
</P>
<P>
   Enough said. This is not about quibbling. Lists, like other
forms of literature, necessarily involve arbitrary and jarring
choices. Any list built on this scale is an automatic invitation to
an argument, a call to step outside, a challenge to one's
tastemanship.
</P>
<P>
   As usually practiced, the 100-list is a more intimate art form.
Most of the time, lists work well, or at least less annoyingly, on
a smaller scale -- the 100 Most Interesting Convicted Felons of
1997, the 100 Best-Groomed Sportswriters of the '90s, the 100 Songs
that Defined the Modern Accordion, The 100 Most Hummable Tunes ...
</P>
<P>
   Taking on a century of civilization is a big order for a top-100
list. Probably too big.
</P>
<P>
   The sweep of the entire 20th Century probably would probably
defeat any general-purpose top-100 list. It exhausts the medium.
This is the period of history when people first made airplanes,
spiral-bound notebooks, Orphan Annie mugs, atom bombs and electric
guitars. When people decided to have world wars because the old
kind didn't cut it any more. A time that first developed the
top-100 list as a way for folks to bring order to the chaos of
their times without having to read too much.
</P>
<P>
   Sorting a fairly busy century, person by person, object by
object, forces nonsensical judgments: Do Post-It Notes rank above
Viagra but below the stapler? Is ``Stairway to Heaven'' more
important than ``Yes Sir, That's My Baby''? Where do William
Jennings Bryan and Newt Gingrich rank in their respective ability
to be loud, self-righteous and annoying? Which world war was
better? Whose revolution was more fruitless?
</P>
<P>
   The mind boggles.
</P>
<P>
   And the lists are just beginning to pour in. There are two more
years of aggressive list making before us.
</P>
<P>
   I expect that well before December 1999 -- probably around the
time groups of experts will assemble their list of the Top 100
Lists of the Century -- many people won't be able to look at
another listing. They'll be listless. They won't even be able to
walk into a grocery store with one in their pockets.
</P>
<P>
   But that's still far in the future and I'm not worried yet. I'm
content to stick with my own top-100 listing project. I intend to
declare top-100 lists to be No. 28 among the 100 Most Annoying
Things About 20th Century Daily Life. Well below busy-signals and
shock jocks but above flickering fluorescent lights, candy that
hangs up in vending machines and cars with starting cranks.
</P>
<P>
   There's still time for new entries and I might need to include
the Millennium Computer Bug, as well. Too soon to tell. I'll wait
to see if the computer will print out the list.

 &HT;    Easy salad recipes help take the sizzle out of summer meals
 &HT;    By Jan Norris
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Takeout is our first choice for quick, cool summer meals, but if
you're going to make your own, keep it simple. The most you should
do is boil pasta, as for the first recipe by Marcel Desaulniers.
The recipe is featured in his new book, ``Salad Days'' (Simon &AMP;
Schuster, $27.50.) Note that the recipes in the book, while
inspired, are lengthy and involve several steps.
</P>
<P>
   Penne pasta and spinach with cracked black pepper vinaigrette
</P>
<P>
   For the oven-roasted plum tomatoes:
</P>
<P>
   12 medium plum tomatoes, washed and cored
</P>
<P>
   Salt and freshly ground black pepper
</P>
<P>
   For the cracked black pepper vinaigrette:
</P>
<P>
   4 tablespoons cider vinegar
</P>
<P>
   4 tablespoons fresh lemon juice
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons freshly cracked black peppercorns
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   3/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil
</P>
<P>
   For pasta:
</P>
<P>
   1 pound penne pasta, cooked, drained
</P>
<P>
   Vinaigrette (above)
</P>
<P>
   3/4 pound flat-leaf spinach, stemmed, washed, cut into strips
</P>
<P>
   Salt and pepper to taste
</P>
<P>
   For greens and garnish:
</P>
<P>
   1 cup walnuts, broken, toasted
</P>
<P>
   3/4 pound curly endive, cored, trimmed, cut into 3/4-inch
pieces, washed and dried
</P>
<P>
   To roast the plum tomatoes, preheat oven to 225 degrees. Cut
each tomato in half lengthwise, then cut each half into 2 sections
lengthwise. Place tomatoes, skin side down, on a baking sheet lined
with parchment paper. Season lightly with salt and pepper. Place
tomatoes in preheated oven and roast for 3 hours. Remove and cool
to room temperature. (The tomatoes can be kept at room temperature
for 3 to 4 hours, until ready to use, or stored in a tightly sealed
plastic container in the refrigerator for several days.)
</P>
<P>
   To make the vinaigrette: In a 3-quart stainless steel bowl,
whisk together the cider vinegar, lemon juice, peppercorns, and
salt. Add olive oil in a slow, steady stream while whisking t the
tough stems of the asparagus stalks. In a 3-quart saucepan, heat
the asparagus and enough water to cover to boiling over high heat.
Reduce heat to medium and cook only for 1 minute. Drain in a
colander and set aside to cool to room temperature.
</P>
<P>
   In a blender, combine oil, vinegar, raspberries, sugar and salt
till combined.
</P>
<P>
   To serve, arrange 3 stalks of asparagus side by side on each of
4 serving plates. Place one slice of turkey on top of the asparagus
on each plate with 1 cup of salad greens.
</P>
<P>
   Divide fresh raspberries among the serving plates and sprinkle
with some of the flower petals, if desired. Pulse the vinaigrette
several times in the blender and pour over the salad.
</P>
<P>
   Makes 4 servings.
</P>
<P>
   SHRIMP AND MELON SALAD
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons peanut oil
</P>
<P>
   1 pound large shrimp, peeled and deveined

 &HT;    Cool carry-outs
 &HT;    By Jan Norris
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Frying, searing and melting? Then you're experiencing the South
Florida summer with the rest of us. So who cooks when it's this
hot?
</P>
<P>
   Still, you have to eat. What you need is something cold and
savory _ and here's the key _ prepared by someone else.
</P>
<P>
   Try the ultimate in summer meals to go: The takeout salad.
</P>
<P>
   Quit thinking of boring greens and unripe tomatoes with Italian
dressing in a squeeze pack. Instead, come with us on a search for
great salads from a variety of sources.
</P>
<P>
   Avoid the salad buffets or bars _ order yours made to go for top
freshness. For traditionalists, the delis and sandwich shops
frequently make their sandwich salads available by the pound _ you
can buy egg, chicken and ham salads, then put them on your own bed
of greens, or serve them from a bread bowl. Be creative.
</P>
<P>
   But don't leave your takeout salad in a hot car. Take a cooler
with ice to pack it in if you'll making stops once you pick it up.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a look at some of the best salads we found:
</P>
<P>
   _ Asian influence: At Saigon Garden, a cozy Vietnamese
restaurant in Lantana, they prepare a refreshing mix of shredded
cabbage, carrots, and grapefruit sections, which can be topped with
your choice of shredded chicken, sliced pork or squid rings, all
sprinkled with chopped peanuts. Nuoc nam, the Viet version of Thai
fish sauce, is sweetened with sugar and flavored with more peanuts
to make the fresh dressing. It's a nice alternative to green
salads. ($5.25, about 1 1/2 servings as a main meal. Saigon Garden
is at 3618 Lantana Road, Lantana.)
</P>
<P>
   _ Dilly affair: Fresh chopped dill distinguishes the chicken
salad made by the CR Chicks folks. The chicken is in large strips,
enough for two servings from one salad, and if you make a pasta or
other food to accompany it, it could stretch to feed four. The
fresh dill and light mayonnaise binding are blended with the
chicken _ their signature food _ which has been rotisserie roasted
over wood. While you're there, pick up a pint of gazpacho, the cool
tomato onion and cuke soup, to go with the meal. Don't forget to
ask for croutons. ($3.25, for one salad that will feed two;
gazpacho is $1.50 for a cup. CR Chicks has several takeout stores:
in Stuart on U.S. 1; in Lake Park on Northlake Boulevard and in
Palm Springs on Congress Avenue.)
</P>
<P>
   _ Opa! A bread bakery is an unlikely place to find great salads,
but that's just what they've got at the Old School Bread Co. in
Delray Beach. The Greek is only one of several on the menu. Fresh
greens, chunks of feta cheese, calamata olives and the perfect
oregano-laced vinaigrette made this a winner. The special salad of
the day, a salad nicoise, made with fresh seared tuna, also looked
delicious and their soups were inspired. The bonus is the bread, of
course, for which the bakery is known. ($5.79; feeds one. At the
corner of Atlantic Avenue and First Avenue, across from Old School
Square in Delray Beach.)
</P>
<P>
   _ Say ole. Montezuma is a cozy Mexican restaurant in West Palm
Beach; the owner and his family are from Mexico. This is the real
thing. The cheese atop the salad is not Jack or cheddar, but
Mexican queso blanco, a creamier white cheese that resembles feta.
Shredded beef instead of ground beef is spread not into a huge
shell, but on fried tortillas. The salad is mounded atop it, and
dressed with a light mole. ($5.95, feeds one. Montezuma is at 5607
S. Dixie Highway, West Palm Beach.)
</P>
<P>
   _ Antipasto, anyone? You bet: this is nice enough for company.
Luna's, an Italian pizzeria and restaurant serves up little rolls
of salami, ham and provolone, dotted with pepperoni. They're
perched like blossoms among olives, onion rings and tomatoes that
top a fresh mix of greens. A fresh Italian vinaigrette is sent
along as dressing. But oh, those garlic knots! These rolls elevate
garlic bread to ambrosia. ($5.95, feeds two generously. Garlic
knots: $3 a dozen. Luna's is in downtown Stuart at 49 Flagler Ave.)
</P>
<P>
   _ Love that lobster. If it's seafood you crave, an obvious
choice for summer salads, then get the freshest you can find.
Seafood shops are a good choice _ try the one from Cod and Capers
in Palm Beach Gardens. There, if you call ahead, they make your
salad fresh to order. Lobster salad is a bit pricey at $19.95 a
pound, but then again, it's 90 percent lobster. Celery, onions and
mayonnaise help hold it all together. This is the classic mix they
use on those great lobster rolls from Boston to Maine, by the way.
You can specify Florida or Maine lobster in your salad for the same
price. ($19.95 a pound; figure three or four servings per pound,
depending on other foods served with it. Cod and Capers is in
Loehmann's Plaza on PGA Boulevard, just east of I-95.)
</P>
<P>
   _ Creative creations. Why not mix salads from a deli to get
something of your own creation? With a variety of prepared salads,
a deli or salad buffet gives you endless possibilities. For an
example, we ordered a half-pint of chilled roasted eggplant salad
from Torchio's in Boynton Beach, and added it to their pasta salad,
to come up with one of our own. A perfect luncheon salad.
</P>
<P>
   You could do the same with tuna or shrimp salad and pasta, or
tuna and a couscous salad from the health food store. If you can
find tabbouleh, the classic couscous with mint mix, try it with
some chicken or roasted lamb from a Middle Eastern deli. A fresh
spinach salad from the health food buffet, with fresh fruit on top
and a lemon yogurt dressing is a winner.
</P>
<P>
   PHOTO CAPTIONS:
</P>
<P>
   TRY A CREATIVE COMBO Mix two salads for one hearty lunch or
dinner. Roasted eggplant and pasta salads from Torchio's in Boynton
Beach make a great combination.
</P>
<P>
   GO WITH A GRECIAN FORMULA A Greek salad from the Old School
Bread Company in Delray Beach may make you feel like you're dining
in the Mediterranean. Specialty breads round out the meal.

   LATHAM-COLUMN _ It has been three years now, almost to the day,
that I walked into a Fort Worth nursing home to see my sister. The
air conditioning had died, not that day but the day before. The
nursing home staff was trying to use a series of small box fans to
keep the place
</P>
<P>
   cool. It wasn't working. As I began to search the halls for a
nurse -- there were always too few to do too much work -- one came
from behind me. Before I had a chance to say anything she said to
me:''Help us. Call someone. Make them get this fixed. These people
are going to die.'' (Latham, Marshall News Messenger) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   MINTER-COLUMN _ ATLANTA _ With elections just over, I had
planned to use this space for an in-depth analysis of the results.
Unfortunately, the perils of semirural living intervened and that
will have to be left to less astute observers. (Minter, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   LANE-COLUMN _ DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. _ As the 20th century winds
down, the media are celebrating by creating new and grander
versions of this century's preeminent literary form -- the list.
With the millennium poised to reset us and our computers to the
Year Zero, we are being bombarded with top-100 lists that pay
homage to the past 98 years and assume nothing much will show up
over the next year and half. (Lane, Daytona Beach News-Journal)

a GI squad sent in to save a young private whose three brothers
have already been killed in battle (shades of The Fighting
Sullivans). It's described as unflinchingly realistic in depicting
the bloody D-Day battle at Normandy. But listen up, soldier. A

Destroyed were irreplaceable frescoes by Florentine painters Giotto

   BOOKREVIEW-FARRELLY _ THE COMEDY WRITER, by Peter Farrelly.
Doubleday; 351 pages; $12.95. As you might guess from his credits,
Farrelly writes good locker-room badinage and good one-liners. As
you also might guess, he's considerably less adept when he tries to
deal with anything approaching emotional reality. Perhaps the most
irritating thing about the book is the sheer unlikability of its
characters. Henry is impossible _ a neurotic, a hypochondriac, a

   LIVE-NUDES _ WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Men, you owe J.P. Danko a
debt of gratitude. Night after hellish night, for three months he
endured a grueling blur of silicone, skimpy lingerie and surly
bouncers, all so that there might be an authoritative guide to the
highest-quality adult nightclub entertainment our nation has to
offer. The result: a light-hearted 160-page opus titled Live Nude
Girls ($14.95, St. Martin's Press). It's a practical,
tongue-in-cheek book that will bring a smirk or a dirty laugh of
recognition to anyone familiar with so-called gentlemen's clubs.

   NUDE-SIDETWO _ Patrons at adult entertainment clubs fall neatly

</P>
<P>
   TESTDRIVE _ ATLANTA -- Mergers, acquisitions, retro cars such as
the Volkswagen Beetle and the popularity of massive vehicles such
as the Lincoln Navigator have made for strange times in the auto
industry. To even casual observers, however, nothing seems stranger
than the idea of staid, safety-oriented Volvo introducing certified
head-turning cars. But that's the way it is with the Volvo C70
coupe and convertible, a pair of Swedish-built vehicles best
considered safe, swift, good-looking and pricey. (DeVault, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   SHARP-DRIVING _ ATLANTA -- Bob and Tony are in sales, and they
travel a great deal. Bob normally drives an extended-cab
four-wheel-drive pickup, Tony a two-door sport-utility vehicle.
Both are pretty big men. These two burly types would be taking an
almost 3,000-mile trip in a Volkswagen -- with a diesel engine, no
less. Their boss assured them the VW would be up to the task.
(Sharp, Atlanta Journal-Constitution) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   MECHANIC _ ATLANTA _ Dave Grossman asked a question about fuel
octane. This question actually has a couple of answers. One
pertains to the octane requirements of the vehicle, and the other
addresses the vehicle's response to the lower octane fuel via the
engine's computerized management system. Before I get into the
``whys'' of octane, let's look inside the engine. (Carter, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   WARNER-ON-WOOD _ ATLANTA _ I come to sing the praises of a tool
more often considered hobbyist equipment than a serious woodworking
implement.
</P>
<P>
   It is the Dremel tool, the little hand-held rotary grinder that
used to be called the Moto-Tool, but has more recently been renamed
the MultiPro. It is, in many respects, the WD-40 of tools. (Warner,
Atlanta Journal-Constitution) MOVED.

   TRAVEL
</P>
<P>
   SEA-WORLD _ SAN ANTONIO, Texas _ It's hot, but the summer movies
have been so bad this year that it's not worth cooling off in a
theater, the malls are an air-conditioned bore and ice skating, no
matter how cold the ice, is for wimps. So where can you go to cool
off and simultaneously be entertained? I suggest you take the trip
to Sea World in San Antonio, Texas. (Kallenberg, Austin
American-Statesman) MOVED.

   WWII-FLICKS _ Steven Spielberg has brought back a long-lost
genre - the World War II movie. Saving Private Ryan is the story of
a GI squad sent in to save a young private whose three brothers
have already been killed in battle (shades of The Fighting
Sullivans). It's described as unflinchingly realistic in depicting
the bloody D-Day battle at Normandy. But listen up, soldier. A
World War II movie is still a World War II movie. And that means
we're going to meet that familiar platoon: young, scared,
ethnically balanced. And cliched. (List of other WWII movies

   SALAD-SIDE _ Takeout is our first choice for quick, cool summer

most you should do is boil pasta, as for the first recipe by Marcel
Desaulniers. The recipe is featured in his new book, ``Salad Days''

Ghigo Roli had just finished photographing the Basilica of St.
Francis of Assisi when the initial earthquake struck that, a few

Destroyed were irreplaceable frescoes by Florentine painters Giotto
and Cimabue. Abrams has published ``The Basilica of St. Francis of

serve as an epitaph for one of the most beautiful artworks of the

   BOOKREVIEW-FARRELLY _ THE COMEDY WRITER, by Peter Farrelly.
Doubleday; 351 pages; $12.95. As you might guess from his credits,
Farrelly writes good locker-room badinage and good one-liners. As
you also might guess, he's considerably less adept when he tries to
deal with anything approaching emotional reality. Perhaps the most
irritating thing about the book is the sheer unlikability of its
characters. Henry is impossible _ a neurotic, a hypochondriac, a
mope, a loser. (Eyman, Palm Beach Post) MOVED.

   LIVE-NUDES _ WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Men, you owe J.P. Danko a
debt of gratitude. Night after hellish night, for three months he
endured a grueling blur of silicone, skimpy lingerie and surly
bouncers, all so that there might be an authoritative guide to the
highest-quality adult nightclub entertainment our nation has to
offer. The result: a light-hearted 160-page opus titled Live Nude
Girls ($14.95, St. Martin's Press). It's a practical,
tongue-in-cheek book that will bring a smirk or a dirty laugh of
recognition to anyone familiar with so-called gentlemen's clubs.

   TESTDRIVE _ ATLANTA -- Mergers, acquisitions, retro cars such as
the Volkswagen Beetle and the popularity of massive vehicles such
as the Lincoln Navigator have made for strange times in the auto
industry. To even casual observers, however, nothing seems stranger
than the idea of staid, safety-oriented Volvo introducing certified
head-turning cars. But that's the way it is with the Volvo C70
coupe and convertible, a pair of Swedish-built vehicles best
considered safe, swift, good-looking and pricey. (DeVault, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution) MOVED.

<P>
   SHARP-DRIVING _ ATLANTA -- Bob and Tony are in sales, and they
travel a great deal. Bob normally drives an extended-cab
four-wheel-drive pickup, Tony a two-door sport-utility vehicle.
Both are pretty big men. These two burly types would be taking an
almost 3,000-mile trip in a Volkswagen -- with a diesel engine, no
less. Their boss assured them the VW would be up to the task.
(Sharp, Atlanta Journal-Constitution) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   MECHANIC _ ATLANTA _ Dave Grossman asked a question about fuel
octane. This question actually has a couple of answers. One
pertains to the octane requirements of the vehicle, and the other
addresses the vehicle's response to the lower octane fuel via the
engine's computerized management system. Before I get into the
``whys'' of octane, let's look inside the engine. (Carter, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   WARNER-ON-WOOD _ ATLANTA _ I come to sing the praises of a tool
more often considered hobbyist equipment than a serious woodworking
implement.
</P>
<P>
   It is the Dremel tool, the little hand-held rotary grinder that
used to be called the Moto-Tool, but has more recently been renamed
the MultiPro. It is, in many respects, the WD-40 of tools. (Warner,

   SEA-WORLD _ SAN ANTONIO, Texas _ It's hot, but the summer movies
have been so bad this year that it's not worth cooling off in a

matter how cold the ice, is for wimps. So where can you go to cool
off and simultaneously be entertained? I suggest you take the trip

   LATHAM-COLUMN _ It has been three years now, almost to the day,

Francisco Bay Area is expected to increase nearly 250 percent by

   TV-DRUDGE (Pasadena, Calif.) _ A man who once worked in the gift
shop at CBS and dug through the garbage, putting ``news'' and rumor

bigger than he could imagine and the man many believe will spell
the end of journalism all together. No, he's not Peter Arnett. He

<P>
   BOOKS-LISTS (San Francisco) _ On the heels of the hundred most
important people and the hundred best American films comes the
hundred best English-language novels of the century, trumpeted this
week by a panel of literates from Modern Library. It's another sign
of the sound-biting of the American intellect, of cutting culture

   AISAN-HOLOCAUST (Oakland, Calif.) _ The photos and text of ``The
Forgotten Holocaust'' exhibition at the Navy Library on Treasure
Island could nauseate viewers, but that is the point. The

atrocities, perpetrated by the Japanese military in Asia from 1931
to 1945, aren't all that well known in the West. By WILLIAM WONG.

<P>
   A wild-child woman born in the land of northern lights and
volcanoes, Bjork Gudmundsdottir has made a career of playing pop
paradox _ no surprise for someone whose family has gone from mud
house to MTV in two generations.
</P>
<P>
   Bjork released her first record _ an album of Icelandic folk
songs _ at the age of 11. Since then, her impish looks and outsize
voice have belied the growing maturity of her music. A classically
trained flautist and pianist, she put the primal scream in The
Sugarcubes' pop-punk a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   Gone solo in 1992, she has collaborated with such sound
sculptors as Graham Massey, Tricky, Goldie, Mark Bell and Howie B
to imbue techno with a mysticism suited to her fire-and-ice
sensibility.
</P>
<P>
   With 1997's austere Homogenic, Bjork creates a personal history
of her twisted Icelandic roots: ``Thought I could organize
freedom,'' she sings, ``how Scandinavian of me!''
</P>
<P>
   Here the queen of eclectronica talks about her love of
information, her fear of technology and her sound of schizophrenia.
</P>
<P>
   COLIN BERRY: How wired are Icelanders?
</P>
<P>
   BJORK: Very. Iceland has always been mad for information. We
wrote the sagas _ what, a thousand years ago? _ documenting
Scandinavian history. We were quick to take to the idea of home
computers because they were all about making access to information
easier.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the best Internet companies in the world are in Iceland,
even though we have only 260,000 people. The capital, Reykjavlk,
where I'm living now, is very modern, but at the same time
surrounded by mountains and oceans. We're still connected to nature
_ my family still hunts for half our food, but using a mobile phone
and a laptop to coordinate with other hunters.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Why are Scandinavians so quick to embrace new technology?
</P>
<P>
   A: It speaks to something inside us. I've got a theory that
people who live in northern climates _ Canadians, Siberians,
Scandinavians, even the North Japanese _ have something in common.
We can talk forever. We love documentation. We can analyze and
analyze and analyze. We've developed sort of a delicious
schizophrenia _ chilly on the outside, but deeply passionate in our
hearts.
</P>
<P>
   Q: You could be describing your own work. Anyone else making
your kind of music?
</P>
<P>
   A: Bands coming from Finland and Canada right now represent a
new generation of electronic musicians. They've grown up with
computers being part of their life, not the scary aliens some
grownups make them out to be. They are very precise, and possess a
strong sense of beauty. Aphex Twin, Squarepusher, people on the
Rephlex label _ their passion is carefully hidden under layers and
layers of information.
</P>
<P>
   Q: One reviewer claimed you ``treat machines like a woman's best
friend''; you've said guitars have no soul. Are you a technophile?
</P>
<P>
   A: I take technology personally. Machines are just tools, and in
that way a synthesizer or a sequencer is no colder than a guitar or
a flute. People tend to treat newly invented things as enemies, as
a threat to their security. But it's a question of how you use
them: A song will be warm if you put warmth in it. I have to say,
though, that they have become good friends of mine.
</P>
<P>
   Q: The machines?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes. We've invented so many noises you can't even count them.
We can make rhythms from the sound of an ant running down a twig.
I'm not obsessed with technology, not at all. I love working with
freedom, but I also love to work with limitations. Something like a
violin has only so many notes; it's only made of wood. The person
who can create soul with that has won out on restriction.
</P>
<P>
   Q: You make the same claim on your song ``Alarm Call'': ``The
less room you give me, the more space I've got.''
</P>
<P>
   A: Well, a new noise can be as rich and unpredictable as 10
instruments in a symphony orchestra. So in the last 50 years,
electronic music has moved forward as new textures are introduced.
Contemporary classical composers writing for stringed instruments
are becoming more and more minimal, trying to find new feelings
rather than new scales or notes. We're dealing with the same
musical structures, but we have so many different textures now.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Does this collision of electronic and acoustic instruments
confuse the music, or create a new kind of fusion?
</P>
<P>
   A: Let me put it this way: A harp will be a harp and a
synthesizer will be a synthesizer. Nothing will ever replace them.
But there will still always be something gorgeous about the
chemistry of a violin or a voice. We're going to reach some sort of
balance.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Indeed, Homogenic seems on the one hand chilly and
restrained, yet at the same time simmering, ready to explode.
</P>
<P>
   A: I have always been into extremes. I live by the ocean, with
massive mountains and swirling blizzards. But I also love my
telephone and fax machine. A part of me is very conservative _ I'm
walking the same streets and hanging out with the same friends I
had since childhood. But I'm also very curious. I jump off cliffs.
In school I hung out with boys with thick glasses who owned insect
collections. I've always been a bit of a trainspotter.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How do you see today's young musicians using technology?
</P>
<P>
   A: It's just like punk rock was a few years ago, except
15-year-olds who want to start a band today buy a synthesizer and a
sequencer instead of a guitar and drums. Orchestras used to need 50
people in order to fill a whole room with sound. Then the rock band
could do it. Now, you just need one person. It's cheaper. It's
easier. You've got more control.
</P>
<P>
   Q: In Post's ``The Modern Things,'' you sing: ``All the modern
things have always existed, they've just been waiting to come out
and multiply and take over.'' Is this the end, or the beginning?
</P>
<P>
   A: People who make new music and express themselves get the most
personal freedom for their imagination. I'm obsessed with that _
even romantic about it. Music is like electricity: It's always been
there, now we're learning more and more how to understand it.

<P>
   A wild-child woman born in the land of northern lights and
volcanoes, Bjork Gudmundsdottir has made a career of playing pop
paradox _ no surprise for someone whose family has gone from mud
house to MTV in two generations.
</P>
<P>
   Bjork released her first record _ an album of Icelandic folk
songs _ at the age of 11. Since then, her impish looks and outsize
voice have belied the growing maturity of her music. A classically
trained flautist and pianist, she put the primal scream in The
Sugarcubes' pop-punk a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   Gone solo in 1992, she has collaborated with such sound
sculptors as Graham Massey, Tricky, Goldie, Mark Bell and Howie B
to imbue techno with a mysticism suited to her fire-and-ice
sensibility.
</P>
<P>
   With 1997's austere Homogenic, Bjork creates a personal history
of her twisted Icelandic roots: ``Thought I could organize
freedom,'' she sings, ``how Scandinavian of me!''
</P>
<P>
   Here the queen of eclectronica talks about her love of
information, her fear of technology and her sound of schizophrenia.
</P>
<P>
   COLIN BERRY: How wired are Icelanders?
</P>
<P>
   BJORK: Very. Iceland has always been mad for information. We
wrote the sagas _ what, a thousand years ago? _ documenting
Scandinavian history. We were quick to take to the idea of home
computers because they were all about making access to information
easier.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the best Internet companies in the world are in Iceland,
even though we have only 260,000 people. The capital, Reykjavlk,
where I'm living now, is very modern, but at the same time
surrounded by mountains and oceans. We're still connected to nature
_ my family still hunts for half our food, but using a mobile phone
and a laptop to coordinate with other hunters.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Why are Scandinavians so quick to embrace new technology?
</P>
<P>
   A: It speaks to something inside us. I've got a theory that
people who live in northern climates _ Canadians, Siberians,
Scandinavians, even the North Japanese _ have something in common.
We can talk forever. We love documentation. We can analyze and
analyze and analyze. We've developed sort of a delicious
schizophrenia _ chilly on the outside, but deeply passionate in our
hearts.
</P>
<P>
   Q: You could be describing your own work. Anyone else making
your kind of music?
</P>
<P>
   A: Bands coming from Finland and Canada right now represent a
new generation of electronic musicians. They've grown up with
computers being part of their life, not the scary aliens some
grownups make them out to be. They are very precise, and possess a
strong sense of beauty. Aphex Twin, Squarepusher, people on the
Rephlex label _ their passion is carefully hidden under layers and
layers of information.
</P>
<P>
   Q: One reviewer claimed you ``treat machines like a woman's best
friend''; you've said guitars have no soul. Are you a technophile?
</P>
<P>
   A: I take technology personally. Machines are just tools, and in
that way a synthesizer or a sequencer is no colder than a guitar or
a flute. People tend to treat newly invented things as enemies, as
a threat to their security. But it's a question of how you use
them: A song will be warm if you put warmth in it. I have to say,
though, that they have become good friends of mine.
</P>
<P>
   Q: The machines?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes. We've invented so many noises you can't even count them.
We can make rhythms from the sound of an ant running down a twig.
I'm not obsessed with technology, not at all. I love working with
freedom, but I also love to work with limitations. Something like a
violin has only so many notes; it's only made of wood. The person
who can create soul with that has won out on restriction.
</P>
<P>
   Q: You make the same claim on your song ``Alarm Call'': ``The
less room you give me, the more space I've got.''
</P>
<P>
   A: Well, a new noise can be as rich and unpredictable as 10
instruments in a symphony orchestra. So in the last 50 years,
electronic music has moved forward as new textures are introduced.
Contemporary classical composers writing for stringed instruments
are becoming more and more minimal, trying to find new feelings
rather than new scales or notes. We're dealing with the same
musical structures, but we have so many different textures now.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Does this collision of electronic and acoustic instruments
confuse the music, or create a new kind of fusion?
</P>
<P>
   A: Let me put it this way: A harp will be a harp and a
synthesizer will be a synthesizer. Nothing will ever replace them.
But there will still always be something gorgeous about the
chemistry of a violin or a voice. We're going to reach some sort of
balance.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Indeed, Homogenic seems on the one hand chilly and
restrained, yet at the same time simmering, ready to explode.
</P>
<P>
   A: I have always been into extremes. I live by the ocean, with
massive mountains and swirling blizzards. But I also love my
telephone and fax machine. A part of me is very conservative _ I'm
walking the same streets and hanging out with the same friends I
had since childhood. But I'm also very curious. I jump off cliffs.
In school I hung out with boys with thick glasses who owned insect
collections. I've always been a bit of a trainspotter.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How do you see today's young musicians using technology?
</P>
<P>
   A: It's just like punk rock was a few years ago, except
15-year-olds who want to start a band today buy a synthesizer and a
sequencer instead of a guitar and drums. Orchestras used to need 50
people in order to fill a whole room with sound. Then the rock band
could do it. Now, you just need one person. It's cheaper. It's
easier. You've got more control.
</P>
<P>
   Q: In Post's ``The Modern Things,'' you sing: ``All the modern
things have always existed, they've just been waiting to come out
and multiply and take over.'' Is this the end, or the beginning?
</P>
<P>
   A: People who make new music and express themselves get the most
personal freedom for their imagination. I'm obsessed with that _
even romantic about it. Music is like electricity: It's always been
there, now we're learning more and more how to understand it.

   The center of Berlin today is the largest construction site in
Europe, a high-tech endeavor pharaonic in scale. The new
foundations have been laid beneath groundwater level by scuba
divers, while giant machines assembled in front of the parliament
building are drilling an astonishing network of subterranean
transport tunnels.
</P>
<P>
   Mile after mile of scaffolding lines the streets of the decayed
neighborhoods in the East, and courtyards echo with the shouts of
immigrant workers.
</P>
<P>
   Developers, engineers and contract laborers have come here from
around the world to help build a new capital for Germany, and
perhaps for all Europe.
</P>
<P>
   The last great urban redevelopment plan for Berlin, scheduled
for completion in 1950, was sketched by Adolf Hitler. Hitler's
``Germania'' would have reoriented Berlin on a north-south axis,
defined by a grand boulevard running between a 700-foot dome and an
enormous memorial arch more than twice as high as the Arc de
Triomphe.
</P>
<P>
   By 1938, a hundred people were at work in Albert Speer's
planning office, and tens of thousands of apartments had already
been vacated, a task made tragically more expedient by the fact
that many of the residents were Jews.
</P>
<P>
   A few years later, Allied bombing raids had reduced much of
Berlin to rubble. For the rest of the century, the once-great
Prussian manufacturing center was suspended in a state of blank
stasis, held motionless by the tension of the conflict between East
and West.
</P>
<P>
   Postwar Berlin was a city with a wall and grassy rubble in place
of its old core. It had edges, but no center. Though the western
sector boasted a few thriving commercial districts, the economy was
artificially pumped up by subsidies, and serious investment went
elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   In the East, meanwhile, communist rebuilding projects were mired
in the lassitude of the planned economy, and grand boulevards
started crumbling almost as soon as they were completed.
</P>
<P>
   Then the Wall fell. Awakening nine years ago from its
half-century trance, Berlin has struggled to decide which direction
to look in.
</P>
<P>
   Would it model itself on the new cities of the world, with their
disregard for history and their willingness to remake themselves
according to exigencies of the global economy and the whims of
savvy developers? Or could Berlin pick up some thread of a local
identity, salvaged from its prewar past?
</P>
<P>
   This is hardly an innocent question, since every gap in the
cityscape of Berlin today is an expression of both the city's
losses and its crimes.
</P>
<P>
   In the heady days that followed reunification, Edzard Reuter,
then the CEO of Daimler-Benz (and the son of Berlin's most famous
mayor), announced that the city's location at the eastern edge of
the European Union would make it the Hong Kong of Eastern Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Daimler-Benz decided to locate the headquarters of its
service-oriented subsidiary, debis, in Potsdamer Platz, on a plot
directly atop the old route of the Wall. Sony also decided to move
its European headquarters to Berlin, purchasing a large site
nearby. Scores of other companies were expected to follow.
</P>
<P>
   As the building boom accelerated, Berlin's leaders imagined
their city as the center of the world's attention and the site of
the Olympiad 2000. The idea was already in the air. In 1987 _ the
same visit when he challenged Gorbachev to tear down the Wall _
Ronald Reagan speculated that Berlin would then be an ideal host
for the millennial games, the first held here since 1936, when
Hitler had personally presided.
</P>
<P>
   Now that Berlin was rising from the ashes of its punishment, the
German government envisioned the Olympics returning to a city whose
new prosperity embodied the promise of an undivided Europe.
</P>
<P>
   In the early '90s, economists predicted a massive population
increase. The city economist Eberhard von Einem estimated that
60,000 people would arrive in Berlin every year. The German
government voted to move most of the federal administration from
Bonn to Berlin, which meant the direct transfer of tens of
thousands of government employees, plus attendant law firms,
associations, and political party offices.
</P>
<P>
   To get the attention of investors, the federal government
offered irresistible tax credits, sparking an orgy of speculative
upgrade. No comparable city-building scheme has been seen in Europe
in this century. By the mid-'90s, construction investments in
Berlin reached DM30 billion per year (U.S.$16 billion-plus).
</P>
<P>
   In Potsdamer Platz alone, Daimler-Benz, Sony and the other
developers agreed to put up 29 buildings with 111,000 square meters
of apartment space, 310,000 square meters of office space, and
57,000 square meters of retail shops and restaurants; plus two Imax
theaters, 27 cinemas, a concert stage, an underground train
station, and a grand shopping arcade.
</P>
<P>
   Potsdamer Platz was the most famous ruined site of the old city,
but it represented only a fraction of the new construction. There
would be tens of thousands of fancy apartments built in the central
city _ a planned neighborhood for sophisticated city dwellers. A
new government quarter in the Spreebogen area, with an enormous,
multilevel railway station. Three crosstown tunnels to carry cars,
subway trains, and long-distance trains. A high-rent office and
shopping district running the entire length of Friedrichstrasse,
with its famous border-crossing at Checkpoint Charlie.
</P>
<P>
   The new Berlin is meant to be a ``Gateway to the East,'' a
beacon of German affluence at the edge of the First World.
</P>
<P>
   On the surface, Berlin seems to be liberating itself from
history. The Nazi monuments were erased by bombs five decades ago,
and the Wall has been gone for nine years _ leaving long, inviting
stretches of unfilled lots. Whole swaths of the city are being
razed for new construction.
</P>
<P>
   But if the past is invisible, it is also unavoidable.
Redevelopment schemes in Berlin seek either to rewrite the city's
history or to escape it entirely, and their bizarre theatrical
quality stems from this battle with the past.
</P>
<P>
   Berlin's dream is to be the affluent, service-oriented capital
of Europe's richest country and a beacon of hope to its neighbors
in the East, where prosperity remains elusive. Yet the early
results, where visible, hint at spectacular failure. Empty stores
line the streets; a wave of investors has already washed out.
</P>
<P>
   It can be argued that the reconstruction of a 19th-century city
at the border of the 21st century is an exercise in fantasy and
national mythmaking. But Berlin's savviest entrepreneurs and
corporate executives well understand the commercial power of
fantasy.
</P>
<P>
   Alongside the government buildings, they are building a
multibillion-deutschmark theatrical event whose theme is ``great
city.'' Their goal isn't the literal re-creation of an industrial
city, but the creation of a new, convincing urban environment that
will attract a new audience of tourists and knowledge workers.
</P>
<P>
   The dominant philosophy of Berlin redevelopment is ``critical
reconstruction.'' Its adherents want to recapture the ``mythos'' of
the city at an earlier time.
</P>
<P>
   These planners discourage the aggregation of multiple lots into
extended developments and require architects to follow strict rules
governing the height and shape of the buildings, favoring stone and
ceramic exteriors over steel and glass. Where possible, they want
to restore prewar street patterns and building lines.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are asking,'' says Volker Hassemer, a former senator who
now runs an influential city marketing group, ``what was the role
of the central city area in the 19th century? Then we must invent
the contemporary equivalent.''
</P>
<P>
   ``After the Wall had gone, there was a great opportunity not
just to unify but to reestablish the old historical center of the
city,'' recalls Berlin architect Hans Kollhoff, who has worked on
many of the projects.
</P>
<P>
   The 50-year interruption in center-city development preserved,
paradoxically, something of prewar Berlin. The rare possibility
thus exists to realize a vision of urban life distinctly at odds
with the chaotic and exploding forms of the American and Asian
cities of the second half of the century.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was severe damage'' to Berlin, Kollhoff says, ``but
people retained a certain image of their city, a very precise
image, and they want to regain something of that old world. Good
cities are made of quiet buildings that people like,'' he reasons.
</P>
<P>
   Friedrichstrasse, the showplace project of the new Berlin,
passes a few hundred meters east of the Brandenburg Gate. Like a
cat colonizing a new house by staking out a strip of defensible
territory close to an obvious exit, West German investors quickly
got involved in this nearby sector of the eastern part of the city.
</P>
<P>
   Up went dozens of new buildings, an invented promenade designed
to satisfy all the dreams of the liberated consumers in the eastern
sector. For block after block, the obedient ranks of offices and
storefronts press close to the street.
</P>
<P>
   But the critical reconstruction of Friedrichstrasse has created
the form of a 19th-century city _ without the people. The shopping
showplace sits like an island between the wealthy western part of
the city and the poor East. Meanwhile, West Berliners continue to
shop in their familiar spots.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the buildings are owned by the banks now,'' says
Michael Sontheimer, the Berlin bureau chief of Der Spiegel, whose
office on Friedrichstrasse overlooks the street. ``Very few of the
original investors are still around.''
</P>
<P>
   At 5 p.m., on a Monday, out Sontheimer's window are the dark
glass bands of Galeries Lafayette, across which hang ribbons of
bright electric text. Inside, the Planet Hollywood store is empty,
as is the jewelry shop. There are no customers at DKNY. At the
photo boutique a man is asking a clerk to make a photocopy for him,
but it is not clear whether this is a commercial transaction or
simply a favor.
</P>
<P>
   Down the street, not a single person can be seen in the elegant
modernist lobby of the Atrium Friedrichstrasse, a truly imposing
eight-story space lined with interior windows and overlooked by an
open, metalwork staircase at each corner.
</P>
<P>
   At the front, a double-columned business directory has plenty of
room for additions. The absence of tenants is strangely compelling.
The mostly blank rectangles in the directory look like dominos set
face down, waiting for a game to restart.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most obvious reasons that Friedrichstrasse remains
empty is that Berlin remains poor. Despite the early commitments
from Sony and Daimler-Benz, it hasn't proven strictly necessary to
establish an office in Berlin in order to do business in eastern
Europe.
</P>
<P>
   The slowly developing economies of the former communist
countries are forming their own direct ties to the power centers of
the West. The main airport hubs for heading east are Frankfurt and
Vienna, not Berlin.
</P>
<P>
   While the government is still scheduled to move by the turn of
the century, the German Institute for Economic Research has revised
its population prediction and now expects the Berlin population to
shrink slightly between now and 2015. Many of the government
employees are expected to settle in the suburbs. Unemployment in
the city hovers between 17 percent and 18 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the takeover of formerly East German industries by
private firms from the West has rendered much of the East Berlin
population unemployable.
</P>
<P>
   As for the physical environment, finding beauty in central
Berlin today is not difficult, but it requires a postmodern taste.
In the jumble of dilapidated postwar apartments alternating with
gentrified neighbors, harsh East German government buildings, and
isolated 19th-century monuments, there is a provocative lack of
imposed logic, and a sense that only very local patterns of order
can be grasped.
</P>
<P>
   It is the kind of environment that young people and the very
ambitious enjoy, because it presents, in every direction, the
prospect of problems to be solved.
</P>
<P>
   ``In America,'' says Hanns Nerger, director of the Berlin
Tourism office, ``you would have a memorial Wall and a simulated
escape.'' But Berlin is too haunted to commercialize its history.
It will never host a simulated Wall or a Naziworld.
</P>
<P>
   Some of Berlin's leaders would like the city to connect with a
more distant past _ Weimar in the '20s is frequently mentioned.
Others are confident that the Sony Center, however uncharacteristic
today, offers a more accurate picture of Berlin's future than
anything built by the planners and architects native to the city.
</P>
<P>
   And yet there are hundreds of thousands of Berliners who are the
people of the old city, of an old Berlin, a Berlin of work and
politics, who have been superseded by the new dispensation. The
millions who inhabit this old Berlin are not recognized in any new
vision of the city _ whether it be the European ideal of critical
reconstruction, or the global entertainment culture.
</P>
<P>
   Today Berlin's challenge, and its tangible intrigue, is that no
political language, no common resource of symbols and forms, has
yet emerged in the theatrical new space where city life is being
remade.

   Daimler-Benz decided to locate the headquarters of its
service-oriented subsidiary, debis, in Potsdamer Platz, on a plot
directly atop the old route of the Wall. Sony also decided to move
its European headquarters to Berlin, purchasing a large site
nearby. Scores of other companies were expected to follow.
</P>
<P>
   As the building boom accelerated, Berlin's leaders imagined
their city as the center of the world's attention and the site of
the Olympiad 2000. The idea was already in the air. In 1987 _ the
same visit when he challenged Gorbachev to tear down the Wall _
Ronald Reagan speculated that Berlin would then be an ideal host
for the millennial games, the first held here since 1936, when
Hitler had personally presided.
</P>
<P>
   Now that Berlin was rising from the ashes of its punishment, the
German government envisioned the Olympics returning to a city whose
new prosperity embodied the promise of an undivided Europe.
</P>
<P>
   In the early '90s, economists predicted a massive population
increase. The city economist Eberhard von Einem estimated that
60,000 people would arrive in Berlin every year. The German
government voted to move most of the federal administration from
Bonn to Berlin, which meant the direct transfer of tens of
thousands of government employees, plus attendant law firms,
associations, and political party offices.
</P>
<P>
   To get the attention of investors, the federal government
offered irresistible tax credits, sparking an orgy of speculative
upgrade. No comparable city-building scheme has been seen in Europe
in this century. By the mid-'90s, construction investments in
Berlin reached DM30 billion per year (U.S.$16 billion-plus).
</P>
<P>
   In Potsdamer Platz alone, Daimler-Benz, Sony and the other
developers agreed to put up 29 buildings with 111,000 square meters
of apartment space, 310,000 square meters of office space, and
57,000 square meters of retail shops and restaurants; plus two Imax
theaters, 27 cinemas, a concert stage, an underground train
station, and a grand shopping arcade.
</P>
<P>
   Potsdamer Platz was the most famous ruined site of the old city,
but it represented only a fraction of the new construction. There
would be tens of thousands of fancy apartments built in the central
city _ a planned neighborhood for sophisticated city dwellers. A
new government quarter in the Spreebogen area, with an enormous,
multilevel railway station. Three crosstown tunnels to carry cars,
subway trains, and long-distance trains. A high-rent office and
shopping district running the entire length of Friedrichstrasse,
with its famous border-crossing at Checkpoint Charlie.
</P>
<P>
   The new Berlin is meant to be a ``Gateway to the East,'' a
beacon of German affluence at the edge of the First World.
</P>
<P>
   On the surface, Berlin seems to be liberating itself from
history. The Nazi monuments were erased by bombs five decades ago,
and the Wall has been gone for nine years _ leaving long, inviting
stretches of unfilled lots. Whole swaths of the city are being
razed for new construction.
</P>
<P>
   But if the past is invisible, it is also unavoidable.
Redevelopment schemes in Berlin seek either to rewrite the city's
history or to escape it entirely, and their bizarre theatrical
quality stems from this battle with the past.
</P>
<P>
   Berlin's dream is to be the affluent, service-oriented capital
of Europe's richest country and a beacon of hope to its neighbors
in the East, where prosperity remains elusive. Yet the early
results, where visible, hint at spectacular failure. Empty stores
line the streets; a wave of investors has already washed out.
</P>
<P>
   It can be argued that the reconstruction of a 19th-century city
at the border of the 21st century is an exercise in fantasy and
national mythmaking. But Berlin's savviest entrepreneurs and
corporate executives well understand the commercial power of
fantasy.
</P>
<P>
   Alongside the government buildings, they are building a
multibillion-deutschmark theatrical event whose theme is ``great
city.'' Their goal isn't the literal re-creation of an industrial
city, but the creation of a new, convincing urban environment that
will attract a new audience of tourists and knowledge workers.
</P>
<P>
   The dominant philosophy of Berlin redevelopment is ``critical
reconstruction.'' Its adherents want to recapture the ``mythos'' of
the city at an earlier time.
</P>
<P>
   These planners discourage the aggregation of multiple lots into
extended developments and require architects to follow strict rules
governing the height and shape of the buildings, favoring stone and
ceramic exteriors over steel and glass. Where possible, they want
to restore prewar street patterns and building lines.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are asking,'' says Volker Hassemer, a former senator who
now runs an influential city marketing group, ``what was the role
of the central city area in the 19th century? Then we must invent
the contemporary equivalent.''
</P>
<P>
   ``After the Wall had gone, there was a great opportunity not
just to unify but to reestablish the old historical center of the
city,'' recalls Berlin architect Hans Kollhoff, who has worked on
many of the projects.
</P>
<P>
   The 50-year interruption in center-city development preserved,
paradoxically, something of prewar Berlin. The rare possibility
thus exists to realize a vision of urban life distinctly at odds
with the chaotic and exploding forms of the American and Asian
cities of the second half of the century.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was severe damage'' to Berlin, Kollhoff says, ``but
people retained a certain image of their city, a very precise
image, and they want to regain something of that old world. Good
cities are made of quiet buildings that people like,'' he reasons.
</P>
<P>
   Friedrichstrasse, the showplace project of the new Berlin,
passes a few hundred meters east of the Brandenburg Gate. Like a
cat colonizing a new house by staking out a strip of defensible
territory close to an obvious exit, West German investors quickly
got involved in this nearby sector of the eastern part of the city.
</P>
<P>
   Up went dozens of new buildings, an invented promenade designed
to satisfy all the dreams of the liberated consumers in the eastern
sector. For block after block, the obedient ranks of offices and
storefronts press close to the street.
</P>
<P>
   But the critical reconstruction of Friedrichstrasse has created
the form of a 19th-century city _ without the people. The shopping
showplace sits like an island between the wealthy western part of
the city and the poor East. Meanwhile, West Berliners continue to
shop in their familiar spots.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the buildings are owned by the banks now,'' says
Michael Sontheimer, the Berlin bureau chief of Der Spiegel, whose
office on Friedrichstrasse overlooks the street. ``Very few of the
original investors are still around.''
</P>
<P>
   At 5 p.m., on a Monday, out Sontheimer's window are the dark
glass bands of Galeries Lafayette, across which hang ribbons of
bright electric text. Inside, the Planet Hollywood store is empty,
as is the jewelry shop. There are no customers at DKNY. At the
photo boutique a man is asking a clerk to make a photocopy for him,
but it is not clear whether this is a commercial transaction or
simply a favor.
</P>
<P>
   Down the street, not a single person can be seen in the elegant
modernist lobby of the Atrium Friedrichstrasse, a truly imposing
eight-story space lined with interior windows and overlooked by an
open, metalwork staircase at each corner.
</P>
<P>
   At the front, a double-columned business directory has plenty of
room for additions. The absence of tenants is strangely compelling.
The mostly blank rectangles in the directory look like dominos set
face down, waiting for a game to restart.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most obvious reasons that Friedrichstrasse remains
empty is that Berlin remains poor. Despite the early commitments
from Sony and Daimler-Benz, it hasn't proven strictly necessary to
establish an office in Berlin in order to do business in eastern
Europe.
</P>
<P>
   The slowly developing economies of the former communist
countries are forming their own direct ties to the power centers of
the West. The main airport hubs for heading east are Frankfurt and
Vienna, not Berlin.
</P>
<P>
   While the government is still scheduled to move by the turn of
the century, the German Institute for Economic Research has revised
its population prediction and now expects the Berlin population to
shrink slightly between now and 2015. Many of the government
employees are expected to settle in the suburbs. Unemployment in
the city hovers between 17 percent and 18 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the takeover of formerly East German industries by
private firms from the West has rendered much of the East Berlin
population unemployable.
</P>
<P>
   As for the physical environment, finding beauty in central
Berlin today is not difficult, but it requires a postmodern taste.
In the jumble of dilapidated postwar apartments alternating with
gentrified neighbors, harsh East German government buildings, and
isolated 19th-century monuments, there is a provocative lack of
imposed logic, and a sense that only very local patterns of order
can be grasped.
</P>
<P>
   It is the kind of environment that young people and the very
ambitious enjoy, because it presents, in every direction, the
prospect of problems to be solved.
</P>
<P>
   ``In America,'' says Hanns Nerger, director of the Berlin
Tourism office, ``you would have a memorial Wall and a simulated
escape.'' But Berlin is too haunted to commercialize its history.
It will never host a simulated Wall or a Naziworld.
</P>
<P>
   Some of Berlin's leaders would like the city to connect with a
more distant past _ Weimar in the '20s is frequently mentioned.
Others are confident that the Sony Center, however uncharacteristic
today, offers a more accurate picture of Berlin's future than
anything built by the planners and architects native to the city.
</P>
<P>
   And yet there are hundreds of thousands of Berliners who are the
people of the old city, of an old Berlin, a Berlin of work and
politics, who have been superseded by the new dispensation. The
millions who inhabit this old Berlin are not recognized in any new
vision of the city _ whether it be the European ideal of critical
reconstruction, or the global entertainment culture.
</P>
<P>
   Today Berlin's challenge, and its tangible intrigue, is that no
political language, no common resource of symbols and forms, has
yet emerged in the theatrical new space where city life is being
remade.

<P>
   Tens of millions of people have been forced from their homes
during the past decade by armed conflict, internal strife and
systematic violations of human rights, all the while remaining
within the borders of their own countries.
</P>
<P>
   No continent has been spared.
</P>
<P>
   Africa today counts about 10 million internally displaced
persons, Europe and Asia some 5 million each, and Latin America up
to 2 million. These masses in flight _ who, unlike refugees, have
not crossed a border _ constitute the newest global crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Internal displacement always has severe humanitarian
implications. These displaced persons are at the greatest risk of
starvation, have the highest rates of preventable disease and are
the most vulnerable to human rights abuses.
</P>
<P>
   Internal displacement is a symptom of state dysfunction that
poses a threat to political and economic stability at the national
and international levels. Both the communities left behind and the
towns and villages in which the displaced find refuge are often
ravaged.
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, so many people flee that whole societies are
uprooted. Violence and instability can spread through entire
regions, forcing neighboring states to bear the brunt of massive
refugee flows. Even countries continents away may have to contend
with a wave of desperate refugees.
</P>
<P>
   Today's crisis of internal displacement is no less acute than
the refugee crisis that confronted Europe after World War II. Then,
humanitarian needs coupled with practical political and economic
interests brought about a system of international protection and
assistance for those displaced outside their native countries.
</P>
<P>
   In 1951, the position of U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees was
created and a U.N. refugee convention adopted. Today, UNHCR has a
staff of 5,000, an annual budget of more than $1 billion, and 13.2
million refugees in its care.
</P>
<P>
   But those forced from their homes who remain under their
government's jurisdiction are not covered by any international
arrangements. Although their numbers now exceed those of refugees,
no international institution is specifically charged with their
protection or assistance. The absurdity is that if these people had
crossed a border, they would fall under U.N. protection.
</P>
<P>
   Internal displacement became a subject of international concern
in the late 1980s. When the numbers were first compiled in 1982,
1.2 million people were estimated to be displaced in 11 countries.
Four years later the total had grown to 14 million. Since the early
1990s, the numbers have fluctuated between 20 million and 25
million in 35 to 40 countries.
</P>
<P>
   The major reason for this dramatic increase was the rise in
internal conflicts as the Cold War came to a close. The proxy wars
the superpowers fought in the 1980s displaced millions of people
who came into full view only as Cold War tensions eased in Angola,
Mozambique, Ethiopia, Afghanistan, Cambodia and El Salvador. The
arms the United States and the Soviet Union had supplied to regimes
or opposition movements furnished the weaponry for the ethnic and
clan warfare that broke out once the superpowers departed.
</P>
<P>
   Liberia and Somalia, two countries that plunged into civil war,
were among the largest recipients of U.S. military assistance in
sub-Saharan Africa during the 1980s. In Europe and Central Asia,
the collapse of the Soviet Union lifted the lid on nationalist
aspirations and ethnic rivalries that displaced millions more.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, vast disparities in wealth, land ownership and power
have been at the root of conflict. In Rwanda and Burundi, high
population density and limited fertile land exacerbated tensions
between Hutus and Tutsis. In Colombia, conflict over land has
forced hundreds of thousands from their homes.
</P>
<P>
   In other cases, struggles between governments and minorities
have produced mass displacement. In Sudan, which has the world's
largest internally displaced population, the efforts of successive
northern governments to impose Islam on the black African south
have made 4 million people homeless.
</P>
<P>
   In Turkey, which has the second-largest displaced population,
government repression against the Kurdish minority has sent 2
million people fleeing for their lives.
</P>
<P>
   The 1990s have seen greater willingness on the part of the
international community to intervene in these situations, even
without the consent of the government concerned. A major motivation
has been the desire to forestall international flows of refugees.
</P>
<P>
   As the number of refugees has grown, Western governments as well
as those in Africa and elsewhere have become less welcoming to
those in flight. Their focus has shifted to keeping people in their
homelands. The U.N. Security Council justified the international
community's precedent-setting intervention on behalf of the Kurds
in Iraq in 1991 on the grounds that massive flows of refugees
threatened international peace and security.
</P>
<P>
   Subsequent Security Council resolutions on Somalia, Bosnia and
Rwanda have also authorized the use of force to facilitate the
delivery of relief and, in the latter two cases, to protect
internally displaced populations.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the principles of sovereignty, territorial
integrity and noninterference in the internal affairs of states
present formidable obstacles to intervention by international
organizations. While some governments, such as Sri Lanka, invite
international assistance, others deliberately bar humanitarian aid,
seeing it as strengthening their opponents and undermining their
authority.
</P>
<P>
   Sudan, for example, has obstructed humanitarian aid, while
Turkey has blocked all international assistance to its displaced
citizens. Some countries have deliberately starved the displaced
while invoking their sovereignty to keep the international
community at bay.
</P>
<P>
   In response, the representative of the U.N. secretary-general on
internally displaced persons outlined guiding principles for the
rights of the displaced and the duties and obligations of states
and insurgent groups. These principles include a right not to be
arbitrarily displaced, access to humanitarian assistance and
protection while in flight and guarantees of reparations upon
returning home.
</P>
<P>
   While the principles lack legal force, they set standards that
should put both governments and insurgent groups on notice and give
international and nongovernmental organizations (NGOS) a basis for
legitimate action. The United Nations' acknowledgment of these
principles and call for their observance would be an important step
forward.
</P>
<P>
   To date, the international community has focused on providing
food, shelter and medical supplies. Yet displaced persons have
regularly pointed out that security is as great a priority as food.
Providing relief to uprooted people while ignoring the fact they
are being beaten or raped has led some to call the victims the
``well-fed dead.''
</P>
<P>
   Humanitarian assistance and development agencies of all stripes
will have to become more responsible for protecting the people they
assist. Many have silently witnessed abuses because of exaggerated
fears that confronting a host government will result in expulsion
of their personnel and termination of their programs.
</P>
<P>
   The effort would be strengthened if governments and insurgent
groups were made aware that they were dealing with a united front
bound by common human rights and humanitarian standards.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, military interventions have been more
successful in preventing starvation than in physically defending
people at risk. This failure underscores the need for strategies to
prevent genocide and other crimes against humanity that lead to
displacement.
</P>
<P>
   Conflicts that are allowed to fester can produce mass
displacement and leave political and economic scars that damage the
economic well-being and political security of neighboring states,
regions and the international system as a whole.
</P>
<P>
   The world community cannot let this newest challenge go
unchecked.

   Today a new economy is emerging, just as dramatically as
smokestacks sprang from the wheat fields of the agrarian age.
</P>
<P>
   Industrialism is about things, and the efficient production of
them. The revolution today is rooted in networked information _ how
to create it, move it and manage it.
</P>
<P>
   Here are 10 of the companies that are building the new economy _
not just the usual high-tech suspects, but a variety of enterprises
that are using technology, networks and information to reshape the
world.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   AMERICAN INTERNATIONAL GROUP, INC.
</P>

   New York
</P>
<P>
   '97 revenue: $27.9 billion
</P>
<P>
   The insurance business is classically information-driven _ just
think about an actuarial table. But it is also intensely local: To
accurately assess risks _ much less sell policies _ you need to be
there. All of which explains why globe-girdling AIG is a high flier
in a notoriously low-altitude sector.
</P>
<P>
   Founded in Shanghai in 1919, AIG focuses on the simple idea that
in much of the world, insurance _ for people and businesses alike _
is primitive or nonexistent. With offices in 130 countries, more
than half its pretax income comes from non-U.S. sources, including
China, Russia, eastern Europe, Africa and the Middle East. Last
year it even reached an agreement with the Chinese government to
reoccupy its old Shanghai headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   AMERICA ONLINE, INC.
</P>
<P>
   Dulles, Va.
</P>
<P>
   '97 revenue: $1.7 billion
</P>
<P>
   With 11 million subscribers _ plus another 2.5 million on
recently acquired CompuServe _ AOL is the Net's 800-pound gorilla,
and the world's largest (by far) ISP, or information services
provider.
</P>
<P>
   AOL's paying customers cough up $21.95 every month and, earlier
this year, took a 10 percent price-hike in stride. Marketing
companies are lining up to write checks as large as $100 million
for the privilege of offering the AOL masses everything from
videogames to discount phone service.
</P>
<P>
   CHARLES SCHWAB CORP.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco
</P>
<P>
   '97 revenue: $2.3 billion
</P>
<P>
   The Securities and Exchange Commission sparked a democratic
revolution on Wall Street when it eliminated fixed commissions for
brokers two decades ago. Now the Internet promises to finish the
job. Schwab _ and millions of happily liberated investors _ have
been cheering all the way.
</P>
<P>
   Schwab leaped enthusiastically into discount trading while most
brokers tried to protect their inflated profit margins. It
diversified into mutual funds and introduced 24-hour telephone
touch-tone trading.
</P>
<P>
   And it invested heavily in automated trading _ paving the way to
the Internet, where Schwab now owns 47 percent of the electronic
brokerage business. It has also moved into lucrative overseas
markets _ notably stock-mad Asia _ where discount brokering is
still a novelty.
</P>
<P>
   DELL COMPUTER
</P>
<P>
   Round Rock, Texas
</P>
<P>
   '98 revenue: $12.3 billion
</P>
<P>
   If any executive understands the Zen of the information
revolution, it is Michael Dell. His company, the world's No. 3 PC
maker, does few things that are not a direct response to customer
demands. That gives it a big advantage in tracking the marriage
between fast-moving technology and fast-evolving customer tastes.
</P>
<P>
   Dell builds no computer until someone has ordered it. The
company stocks only a two-week inventory. Customers are encouraged
to order directly through Dell's Web site, which chalks up $4
million per day in sales. Suppliers deliver on hourly schedules.
</P>
<P>
   FIRST DATA CORP.
</P>
<P>
   Hackensack, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   '97 revenue: $5 billion
</P>
<P>
   Electronic money isn't the future _ it's here. Credit and debit
cards alone have already taken over an estimated 13 percent of the
U.S. economy. That, in turn, has created a booming, mostly
invisible market for handling noncash transactions _ an opportunity
First Data has quickly climbed into.
</P>
<P>
   First Data controls more than a third of the U.S. credit-card
processing business, including application processing and billing
for MasterCard and Visa. It does Wal-Mart's credit- and debit-card
processing, and works with retail banks on everything from check
verification to in-store ATMs.
</P>
<P>
   It's also a stealth power on the Internet, handling transactions
for some of the biggest online retailers, including Amazon.com and
Dell Computer. It's also expanding overseas, into Germany, Hong
Kong and Spain.
</P>
<P>
   MARRIOTT INTERNATIONAL
</P>
<P>
   Bethesda, Md.
</P>
<P>
   '97 revenue: $9 billion
</P>
<P>
   E-mail, fax and videoconferencing keep people in touch, but
there are some messages you can deliver only by being there. Enter
Marriott International, a dematerialized company geared to the
rising demand for physical presence in an ever-more-networked
world.
</P>
<P>
   Marriott International operates hotels that span the cost
spectrum, from cheap and cheerful (Fairfield Inns and Suites) to
posh (Ritz-Carlton). But the key to its success is classic new
economics: It doesn't actually own most of the hotels it operates.
Investors with a taste for bricks and mortar do that; Marriott
concentrates on the lower-capital, higher-markup business of making
people comfortable.
</P>
<P>
   And in some markets it goes further, franchising everything but
a hotel's essence: operating procedures, quality control and a
familiar name.
</P>
<P>
   The result is steady income flows, insulation from real estate's
booms and busts and a string of powerful brands _ not to mention
the irony that a company that depends on people needing to be
somewhere can disembody itself.
</P>
<P>
   MONSANTO CO.
</P>
<P>
   St. Louis, Mo.
</P>
<P>
   '97 revenue: $7.5 billion
</P>
<P>
   In 1997 Monsanto became a new-economy Cinderella: It spun out
its venerable chemicals business and plunged all-out into
biotechnology. ``Life sciences'' is the company buzzphrase. But the
customer is still farmers around the world _ especially big-time
agribusiness _ clamoring for everything from sharp-shooting
pesticides to designer seeds.
</P>
<P>
   Monsanto has already racked up one of smart farming's first hits
with Roundup Ready cotton and soybeans _ crops genetically altered
to resist the effects of Monsanto's widely used biodegradable
herbicide.
</P>
<P>
   The big leap now includes a bid _ which could top $2 billion _
for Illinois-based DeKalb Genetics, a high-flying seed company that
develops transgenic crops custom-designed to resist insects and
improve yields. Some of the biggest potential markets are in the
pest-ridden, fertilizer-poor developing world. As such, Monsanto
has major plans for both China and India.

   NOKIA CORP.

<P>
   Espoo, Finland
</P>
<P>
   '97 revenue: $9.7 billion
</P>
<P>
   Wireless communications is both a boom and a boon. Digital
technology takes it a step further. Nokia sells more digital
mobile-communications devices than anybody in the world. More
intriguing, it also leads the way with mobile
phone/fax/e-mail/browsers, new hybrids that put information at your
fingertips, no matter where you are or what you're doing _ a new
economy niche if there ever was one.
</P>
<P>
   Nokia is one of those rare organizations that has never been
afraid to reinvent itself. The companies that merged to create it
in 1922 made galoshes, tissues and cables. Today, one in four
employees works in research and development.
</P>
<P>
   But in choosing opportunities, Nokia has consistently been
driven by its customers. Scandinavia has the highest mobile-phone
usage in the world _ something about long distances and longer
nights. Meanwhile, Finland vies with the United States for the
title of most-connected nation.

   '97 revenue: $10.6 billion
</P>
<P>
   The essential problem of the oil business isn't drilling holes _
it's knowing where to drill. When big oil companies need to decide
where to set up their rigs, they pay Schlumberger to tell them.
</P>
<P>
   Founded in France 80 years ago, Schlumberger gets its talent by
scouring universities for serious geeks with a taste for adventure
travel. Airlifted into remote sites with a few high-powered
workstations and a satellite link to the supercomputers back at
headquarters, Schlumberger's frontline teams pull information from
deep underground, then run the data through software models to
predict where the oil is and how it will flow into the well.
</P>
<P>
   Schlumberger's smarts are a crucial reason why proven oil
reserves are now 60 percent bigger than they were than in 1980,
when the world was convinced it was running out of oil.
</P>
<P>
   SMITHKLINE BEECHAM
</P>
<P>
   Brentford, England
</P>
<P>
   '97 revenue: $12.8 billion
</P>
<P>
   Like all the big drug companies, SmithKline Beecham makes most
of its money from prescription drugs _ the popular antidepressant
Paxil, for one _ plus a menagerie of branded over-the-counter
remedies such as Tums, Contac and Aquafresh. Unlike the rest of the
industry in the early 1990s, it was quick to see _ and pounce on _
the implications of a heady new field of bioresearch: genomics.
That single move put SmithKline miles ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Today, its genomics-driven research-and-development program is
the envy of the industry. Since 1989, it has signed more than 150
biotech alliances, the most important a five-year-old partnership
with Rockville, Md.-based Human Genome Sciences, a pioneer in
genome research. Marketable products are still years away, but
SmithKline's $125 million investment in HGS has already produced
hundreds of patents on disease-related genes.
</P>
<P>
   SmithKline is also clever about brand extension. Its labs do
more than 100 million diagnostic tests per year, including a
lamentable growth area: workplace drug testing.
</P>
<P>
   WAL-MART INC.
</P>
<P>
   Bentonville, Ark.
</P>
<P>
   '98 revenue: $118 billion
</P>
<P>
   Don't let the downmarket image fool you: Wal-Mart has reinvented
retail logistics. Wal-Mart rose to prominence through a combination
of Sam Walton's dedication to quality, his eye for location and a
system of hub-and-spoke logistics _ stores linked to a central
warehouse _ that meshes local service with economies of scale.
</P>
<P>
   Now Wal-Mart is taking the logic several steps further. For an
increasing number of products, its stores hold little or no
backroom inventory _ suppliers keep them stocked with just-in-time
deliveries. Wal-Mart's keen computers provide the information about
who's buying what, and why.
</P>
<P>
   Wal-Mart's Retail Link network not only records what goods are
purchased and when, but it also lets companies predict sales based
on past buying patterns, special offers and a host of other
factors. Result: Wal-Mart cut inventory by more than $1 billion
last year, even as it expanded sales 12 percent.
</P>
<P>
   For the future, Wal-Mart is looking overseas: It opened 289
stores outside the United States in 1997, only some of which carry
fishing lures and gallon jars of mayonnaise.
</P>
<P>
   THE WALT DISNEY CO.
</P>
<P>
   Burbank, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   '97 revenue: $22.5 billion
</P>
<P>
   Once the definition of tired Americana, Disney, under chair and
CEO Michael Eisner, has been reborn as a global powerhouse.
</P>
<P>
   Its twin pillars are reassuringly safe, ``family'' values _ the
sort that play well from Prague to Peoria _ and up-to-the-minute
technological innovation. Part media giant, part marketing monster,
the Mouse continues to write the book on intellectual property _
how to create it, how to manage it and how to leverage it to the
hilt.
</P>
<P>
   Though its acquisition of a TV network, ABC, has yet to be fully
digested, Disney is one of the few companies working successfully
across different media. ``The Lion King'', for instance, has earned
more than $4.5 billion in worldwide movie, merchandise, video and
music sales.
</P>
<P>
   Disney keeps up technologically, partnering with bleeding-edge
animator Pixar (``Toy Story''), automating its global string of
theme parks and, through its DisneyQuest division, pioneering
virtual reality and so-called location-based entertainment (read:
high-end video arcades for grown-ups).
</P>
<P>
   Eisner has commissioned work by virtually every notable U.S.
architect and has some of biggest thinkers in technology tethered
to Imagineering, the corporate skunkworks. Now if only it could get
Disneyland Paris _ as EuroDisney has been redubbed _ into the
black.

   Today a new economy is emerging, just as dramatically as
smokestacks sprang from the wheat fields of the agrarian age.
</P>
<P>
   Industrialism is about things, and the efficient production of
them. The revolution today is rooted in networked information _ how
to create it, move it and manage it.
</P>
<P>
   Here are 10 of the companies that are building the new economy _
not just the usual high-tech suspects, but a variety of enterprises
that are using technology, networks and information to reshape the
world.
</P>
<P>

<P>
   AMERICAN INTERNATIONAL GROUP, INC.
</P>
<P>
   New York
</P>
<P>
   '97 revenue: $27.9 billion
</P>
<P>
   The insurance business is classically information-driven _ just
think about an actuarial table. But it is also intensely local: To
accurately assess risks _ much less sell policies _ you need to be
there. All of which explains why globe-girdling AIG is a high flier
in a notoriously low-altitude sector.
</P>
<P>
   Founded in Shanghai in 1919, AIG focuses on the simple idea that
in much of the world, insurance _ for people and businesses alike _
is primitive or nonexistent. With offices in 130 countries, more
than half its pretax income comes from non-U.S. sources, including
China, Russia, eastern Europe, Africa and the Middle East. Last
year it even reached an agreement with the Chinese government to
reoccupy its old Shanghai headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   AMERICA ONLINE, INC.
</P>
<P>
   Dulles, Va.
</P>
<P>
   '97 revenue: $1.7 billion
</P>
<P>
   With 11 million subscribers _ plus another 2.5 million on
recently acquired CompuServe _ AOL is the Net's 800-pound gorilla,
and the world's largest (by far) ISP, or information services
provider.
</P>
<P>
   AOL's paying customers cough up $21.95 every month and, earlier
this year, took a 10 percent price-hike in stride. Marketing
companies are lining up to write checks as large as $100 million
for the privilege of offering the AOL masses everything from
videogames to discount phone service.
</P>
<P>
   CHARLES SCHWAB CORP.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco
</P>
<P>
   '97 revenue: $2.3 billion
</P>
<P>
   The Securities and Exchange Commission sparked a democratic
revolution on Wall Street when it eliminated fixed commissions for
brokers two decades ago. Now the Internet promises to finish the
job. Schwab _ and millions of happily liberated investors _ have
been cheering all the way.
</P>
<P>
   Schwab leaped enthusiastically into discount trading while most
brokers tried to protect their inflated profit margins. It
diversified into mutual funds and introduced 24-hour telephone
touch-tone trading.
</P>
<P>
   And it invested heavily in automated trading _ paving the way to
the Internet, where Schwab now owns 47 percent of the electronic
brokerage business. It has also moved into lucrative overseas
markets _ notably stock-mad Asia _ where discount brokering is
still a novelty.
</P>
<P>
   DELL COMPUTER
</P>
<P>
   Round Rock, Texas
</P>
<P>
   '98 revenue: $12.3 billion
</P>
<P>
   If any executive understands the Zen of the information
revolution, it is Michael Dell. His company, the world's No. 3 PC
maker, does few things that are not a direct response to customer
demands. That gives it a big advantage in tracking the marriage
between fast-moving technology and fast-evolving customer tastes.
</P>
<P>
   Dell builds no computer until someone has ordered it. The
company stocks only a two-week inventory. Customers are encouraged
to order directly through Dell's Web site, which chalks up $4
million per day in sales. Suppliers deliver on hourly schedules.
</P>
<P>
   FIRST DATA CORP.
</P>
<P>
   Hackensack, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   '97 revenue: $5 billion
</P>
<P>
   Electronic money isn't the future _ it's here. Credit and debit
cards alone have already taken over an estimated 13 percent of the
U.S. economy. That, in turn, has created a booming, mostly
invisible market for handling noncash transactions _ an opportunity
First Data has quickly climbed into.
</P>
<P>
   First Data controls more than a third of the U.S. credit-card
processing business, including application processing and billing
for MasterCard and Visa. It does Wal-Mart's credit- and debit-card
processing, and works with retail banks on everything from check
verification to in-store ATMs.
</P>
<P>
   It's also a stealth power on the Internet, handling transactions
for some of the biggest online retailers, including Amazon.com and
Dell Computer. It's also expanding overseas, into Germany, Hong
Kong and Spain.
</P>
<P>
   MARRIOTT INTERNATIONAL
</P>
<P>
   Bethesda, Md.
</P>
<P>
   '97 revenue: $9 billion
</P>
<P>
   E-mail, fax and videoconferencing keep people in touch, but
there are some messages you can deliver only by being there. Enter
Marriott International, a dematerialized company geared to the
rising demand for physical presence in an ever-more-networked
world.
</P>
<P>
   Marriott International operates hotels that span the cost
spectrum, from cheap and cheerful (Fairfield Inns and Suites) to
posh (Ritz-Carlton). But the key to its success is classic new
economics: It doesn't actually own most of the hotels it operates.
Investors with a taste for bricks and mortar do that; Marriott
concentrates on the lower-capital, higher-markup business of making
people comfortable.
</P>
<P>
   And in some markets it goes further, franchising everything but
a hotel's essence: operating procedures, quality control and a
familiar name.
</P>
<P>
   The result is steady income flows, insulation from real estate's
booms and busts and a string of powerful brands _ not to mention
the irony that a company that depends on people needing to be
somewhere can disembody itself.
</P>
<P>
   MONSANTO CO.
</P>
<P>
   St. Louis, Mo.
</P>
<P>
   '97 revenue: $7.5 billion
</P>
<P>
   In 1997 Monsanto became a new-economy Cinderella: It spun out
its venerable chemicals business and plunged all-out into
biotechnology. ``Life sciences'' is the company buzzphrase. But the
customer is still farmers around the world _ especially big-time
agribusiness _ clamoring for everything from sharp-shooting
pesticides to designer seeds.
</P>
<P>
   Monsanto has already racked up one of smart farming's first hits
with Roundup Ready cotton and soybeans _ crops genetically altered
to resist the effects of Monsanto's widely used biodegradable
herbicide.
</P>
<P>
   The big leap now includes a bid _ which could top $2 billion _
for Illinois-based DeKalb Genetics, a high-flying seed company that
develops transgenic crops custom-designed to resist insects and
improve yields. Some of the biggest potential markets are in the
pest-ridden, fertilizer-poor developing world. As such, Monsanto
has major plans for both China and India.
</P>
<P>
   NOKIA CORP.
</P>
<P>
   Espoo, Finland
</P>

phone/fax/e-mail/browsers, new hybrids that put information at your

</P>

   Nokia is one of those rare organizations that has never been
afraid to reinvent itself. The companies that merged to create it
in 1922 made galoshes, tissues and cables. Today, one in four

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
   Recent events remind us that journalism is far from the perfect,
objective science we might like it to be. We easily forget that the
facts and allegations of the stories on our TV screens and in our
newspapers are gathered by people _ journalists, who as human
beings, are fallible and fragile.
</P>
<P>
   When journalists fail to tell the entire truth or to find it and
instead resort to dishonest and illegal tactics _ as in an uncommon
number of cases recently in the United States _ they get
reprimanded, they get fired, and bring embarrassment to the
profession.
</P>
<P>
   But good journalism can, at times, be more dangerous than bad
journalism. While lying about a source might cause an American
writer to lose the job, reporting the truth might cause a Latin
American journalist to lose his life.
</P>
<P>
   Eight already have in 1998 alone: two in Brazil, three in
Colombia, one in Mexico and two others in Peru _ a husband and
wife, who together produced a radio program, ``The People's
Voice,'' which advocated peasant's rights. The two were murdered
when 12 armed men entered their home. After the couple was buried,
relatives reported, a police officer visited them and suggested it
would be wise not to pursue an investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Manuel Leal de Oliveira, the publisher and editor of a weekly in
Bahai, Brazil, was killed _ shot 14 times by men who followed him
in a white van as he drove home from work one day. He had exposed
the truth about corruption of local authorities. Likewise, Nelson
Carvajal, a radio reporter who had produced segments on poor
public-health services and alleged government corruption, was
killed _ shot 10 times outside the elementary school where he also
taught in southern Colombia.
</P>
<P>
   In Latin America, the reward for good reporting, and for telling
the truth, is to get murdered by those who want to bury it.
</P>
<P>
   Journalism remains an extremely dangerous and difficult
profession, both for those who write the news and those we write
about. When journalists are reckless with facts and methods _ when
we break the rules of our unspoken code of ethics, not to mention
the country's written laws _ it is unfair to the people we are
writing about and extremely harmful to the credibility of our
profession.
</P>
<P>
   We can get so blinded by the excitement of breaking a story, or
of having a scoop, that we can ignore the truth or tailor it to fit
our needs. In the United States, where freedom of the press is
hailed as a founding virtue, isn't it inexplicable to mock that
gift? As journalists, anywhere in the world, we owe it to our
readers to give them the story based on the facts we have, not on
the ones we wish we had.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, CNN had to retract a story about the U.S. military
using poison gas against American defectors in Laos in 1970. Two
producers were fired; meanwhile, Peter Arnett, the correspondent
who gave us the minute-by-minute account of the Persian Gulf War,
and who was hailed as the last reporter to leave Baghdad, is now
facing scrutiny for not having verified the allegations he
broadcast.
</P>
<P>
   Arnett's claim that he was merely ``the face'' delivering a
story on the air has brought protests from other correspondents
within the profession who don't want their reputations as serious
journalists to be tarnished.
</P>
<P>
   And how about the way vital information is obtained? If the
truth is uncovered by devious means, do we applaud or pillory the
journalist? To what extent is this even more sensitive, given the
global nature of current reportage?
</P>
<P>
   The Cincinnati Enquirer ran a front-page apology, and has agreed
to pay more than $10 million to Chiquita Brands International,
after running a series of critical articles about the company's
business practices. Among the charges was the use of bribery in
Colombia and the spraying of dangerous pesticides in Central
America.
</P>
<P>
   The reporter, Mike Gallagher, is accused of obtaining his
information by stealing more than 2,000 voice-mail recordings from
Chiquita. If Gallagher's allegations about Chiquita's business
practices are true, is it acceptable that he ``stole'' the voice
mail? Are breaking the law and lying in order to get information
going to be acceptable reporting tactics? Journalists are not
exempt from the law, experts say, and Gallagher, described by his
editors as a ``star,'' was nonetheless fired.
</P>
<P>
   Two other important U.S. publications had to fire rising stars.
The weekly political magazine, The New Republic, had to let go of
Stephen Glass, a 27-year-old staff writer, for fabricating
information in 27 of his 41 stories. The Boston Globe fired
Patricia Smith, a columnist whose work was so well-regarded that,
last year, she was nominated for a Pulitzer Prize.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever reasons Arnett, Gallagher, Glass or Smith have for
submitting questionable work, it breeched the most important tenet
of journalism _ it didn't tell the truth.
</P>
<P>
   Glass got caught after he wrote a story, making up the name of
the company, complete with a full name, employees, profit chart and
a convention. When a high-tech reporter read about ``Jukt
Micronics,'' he wondered why he, who covered high-tech business for
an on-line magazine, had never heard of this firm _ it only exists
in Glass' story.
</P>
<P>
   For her column, Smith made up characters _ a woman dying of
cancer, a worker erecting barricades at the Boston Marathon and a
mother buying shoes for her young daughter. When her imaginary
sources spoke, they were so quotable, their words weaved so
perfectly into her stories, that the editors became suspicious.
Smith gave in to a temptation that as journalists we all know _
born of frustration at not having that perfect quote.
</P>
<P>
   What about Glass? Is he too lazy to do any real reporting or too
ambitious, interested only in promoting his byline and moving on to
higher-paying jobs? The New Republic is not known for high
remuneration. Or maybe he is a fiction writer in the trappings of a
reporter and he will now write a best-selling thriller about Jukt
Micronics that will be bought by Hollywood for millions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   This becomes particularly poignant when we have, in other parts
of the world, journalists laying their lives on the line to tell
the truth.
</P>
<P>
   The trials and tribulations of the four U.S. reporters who
manipulated the truth are a reminder that, as journalists, we have
difficult choices to make _ and that, at times, as human beings, we
make mistakes. The faces of the eight slain journalists are
reminders of the dangers and the bravery of telling it.

<P>
   Recent events remind us that journalism is far from the perfect,
objective science we might like it to be. We easily forget that the
facts and allegations of the stories on our TV screens and in our
newspapers are gathered by people _ journalists, who as human
beings, are fallible and fragile.
</P>
<P>
   When journalists fail to tell the entire truth or to find it and
instead resort to dishonest and illegal tactics _ as in an uncommon
number of cases recently in the United States _ they get
reprimanded, they get fired, and bring embarrassment to the
profession.
</P>
<P>
   But good journalism can, at times, be more dangerous than bad
journalism. While lying about a source might cause an American
writer to lose the job, reporting the truth might cause a Latin
American journalist to lose his life.
</P>
<P>
   Eight already have in 1998 alone: two in Brazil, three in
Colombia, one in Mexico and two others in Peru _ a husband and
wife, who together produced a radio program, ``The People's
Voice,'' which advocated peasant's rights. The two were murdered
when 12 armed men entered their home. After the couple was buried,
relatives reported, a police officer visited them and suggested it
would be wise not to pursue an investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Manuel Leal de Oliveira, the publisher and editor of a weekly in
Bahai, Brazil, was killed _ shot 14 times by men who followed him
in a white van as he drove home from work one day. He had exposed
the truth about corruption of local authorities. Likewise, Nelson
Carvajal, a radio reporter who had produced segments on poor
public-health services and alleged government corruption, was
killed _ shot 10 times outside the elementary school where he also
taught in southern Colombia.
</P>
<P>
   In Latin America, the reward for good reporting, and for telling
the truth, is to get murdered by those who want to bury it.
</P>
<P>
   Journalism remains an extremely dangerous and difficult
profession, both for those who write the news and those we write
about. When journalists are reckless with facts and methods _ when
we break the rules of our unspoken code of ethics, not to mention
the country's written laws _ it is unfair to the people we are
writing about and extremely harmful to the credibility of our
profession.
</P>
<P>
   We can get so blinded by the excitement of breaking a story, or
of having a scoop, that we can ignore the truth or tailor it to fit
our needs. In the United States, where freedom of the press is
hailed as a founding virtue, isn't it inexplicable to mock that
gift? As journalists, anywhere in the world, we owe it to our
readers to give them the story based on the facts we have, not on
the ones we wish we had.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, CNN had to retract a story about the U.S. military
using poison gas against American defectors in Laos in 1970. Two
producers were fired; meanwhile, Peter Arnett, the correspondent
who gave us the minute-by-minute account of the Persian Gulf War,
and who was hailed as the last reporter to leave Baghdad, is now
facing scrutiny for not having verified the allegations he
broadcast.
</P>
<P>
   Arnett's claim that he was merely ``the face'' delivering a
story on the air has brought protests from other correspondents
within the profession who don't want their reputations as serious
journalists to be tarnished.
</P>
<P>
   And how about the way vital information is obtained? If the
truth is uncovered by devious means, do we applaud or pillory the
journalist? To what extent is this even more sensitive, given the
global nature of current reportage?
</P>
<P>
   The Cincinnati Enquirer ran a front-page apology, and has agreed
to pay more than $10 million to Chiquita Brands International,
after running a series of critical articles about the company's
business practices. Among the charges was the use of bribery in
Colombia and the spraying of dangerous pesticides in Central

 &HT;    CONTROVERSIAL FLORIDA INCUMBENT COULD FACE A CLOSE RACE
 &HT;    Adds second graf with election history and removes reference to
Rep. Jim Davis in graf 42.
 &HT;    For release Sunday, July 26.
 &HT;    BY LARRY LIPMAN
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Rep. Corrine Brown, D-Fla., is no stranger to
controversy, or to victory.
</P>
<P>
   She has been elected every two years since 1982, five times to
the Florida Legislature and three times to Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with controversies swirling around her dealings with a West
African businessman convicted of bribery and the Rev. Henry Lyons,
the indicted head of the National Baptist Convention USA, her
future is again being questioned.
</P>
<P>
   The outcome could affect which party will control the House of
Representatives next year.
</P>
<P>
   With Republicans holding a 12-member margin, both parties are
looking carefully at any race that might be competitive. Rep. John
Linder, R-Ga., chairman of the Republican National Congressional
Committee _ the group that recruits and helps finance GOP House
candidates _ said there is an opportunity to pick up Brown's 3rd
Congressional District, which sprawls across portions of nine
counties from Jacksonville to Orlando.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any time you are running against someone who has to refer all
of her questions about her campaign to her attorney,'' that's a
race with potential, Linder said.
</P>
<P>
   Linder's committee will almost certainly give Brown's opponent,
businessman Bill Randall, the $5,000 maximum contribution allowed.
Whether it also will spend the roughly $60,000 allowed in
coordinated expenditures won't be decided until this fall, though
Linder said it is likely.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to look at all the races and fully fund 90 to 100,
and this will probably be one of those, unless our candidate takes
a hike,'' Linder said, adding that he expects Randall to run a
competitive race.
</P>
<P>
   Linder isn't counting on unseating Brown to retain Republican
control of the House.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not the key to our holding a majority. With or without
this election, we will add to our numbers,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   If the Democrats are worried about holding Brown's seat, they're
not voicing those concerns.
</P>
<P>
   ``Corrine Brown is an excellent member of Congress,'' said Rep.
Martin Frost, D-Texas, chairman of the Democratic Congressional
Campaign Committee. ``I think she will be judged on her record. I
have every confidence that she will be re-elected and probably
re-elected by a significant margin.''
</P>
<P>
   Frost noted that previous opponents have tried to tar Brown with
ethical misdeeds and failed dramatically.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Corrine will be just fine,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, despite a record marred with ethical missteps Brown's
political fortunes have flourished.
</P>
<P>
   At 51, the Jacksonville native is a political veteran who served
10 years in the Legislature and three terms in Congress. During
those years she earned a reputation as a savvy politician who would
fight tenaciously for her constituents and their causes.
</P>
<P>
   She's also done things that have led political opponents to
question her ethics.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  In 1990, Brown helped a friend win a $425,000 federal
``business incubator'' grant. The project failed, and the city of
Jacksonville was forced to repay $314,000 out of future federal
block grants. The state attorney's office investigated Brown's role
in the grant, but said there was no reason to press charges.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  In 1993, Brown agreed to pay a $5,000 fine _ but did not admit
guilt _ after a state ethics commission found probable cause to
believe she illegally used state employees to work in her private
travel agency.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Also in 1993, Brown's campaign treasurer quit after learning
his signature had been forged on several Federal Election
Commission reports by her administrative assistant. Later that
year, Brown submitted amended FEC reports showing she previously
had not reported more than $12,000 in expenditures.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  In addition to her campaign finance problems that year,
Brown's chief assistant in her congressional district was
discovered to have been convicted in 1972 of second-degree murder.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  In 1994, the FEC issued a report that Brown violated several
campaign finance laws during her 1992 race, including using a
corporate plane without showing she had paid for it, making loans
to her campaign without showing the money came from her personal
account, and illegally accepting donations from foreign citizens
and from corporations. A Brown aide blamed the mistakes on her
unfamiliarity with differences in state and federal campaign laws.
</P>
<P>
   The current controversies swirling around Brown could make those
of the past pale by comparison.
</P>
<P>
   They break down into three distinct episodes involving a check,
a car, and a trip, all first reported by The St. Petersburg Times.
Brown, who has repeatedly avoided discussing these controversies
with the media _ even filing harassment charges against two Times
reporters that were later dropped _ declined to be interviewed for
this story.
</P>
<P>
   The first controversy involves a $10,000 check Brown received in
1996 from the Rev. Henry Lyons, drawn on a Milwaukee bank account.
Lyons, who lived a lavish lifestyle as head of the predominantly
black Baptist organization, has been charged by a Florida
prosecutor with racketeering and grand theft. Prosecutors have been
trying to tie Lyons to the Wisconsin account, which held more than
$1 million in money allegedly extorted from a Canadian company.
</P>
<P>
   Brown did not list the check on her campaign finance report or
on her personal financial disclosure report.
</P>
<P>
   Brown's attorneys said the check was used to pay for buses to
carry her supporters to a rally held outside the U.S. District
courthouse in Tallahassee where a three-judge panel was deciding
how to redraw her district's boundaries. The U.S. Supreme Court had
earlier ruled that districts similar to Brown's had been improperly
gerrymandered along racial lines.
</P>
<P>
   Because the money was used to help pay for the redistricting
rally, it was not considered a campaign expense and, therefore, did
not have to be included in her campaign reports, her attorneys
said.
</P>
<P>
   But the news stories indicated Brown was not able to demonstrate
that Lyons' check went to pay for the buses. Her campaign reported
spending only $2,000 on the buses.
</P>
<P>
   The second controversy revolves around the car and the convict.
The Times reported that West African businessman Foutanga Dit
Babani Sissoko bought a Lexus LS400 _ valued at about $50,000 _ for
Brown's 32-year-old daughter, Shantrel, a lawyer with the
Environmental Protection Agency, after Brown tried to keep him out
of prison.
</P>
<P>
   House ethics rules prohibit lawmakers from receiving gifts. The
ban also extends to members' families if the gift to the relative
is an attempt to get around the rule.
</P>
<P>
   Sissoko, who now lives in Mali, was sentenced in 1997 to four
months in prison, four months of house arrest and fined $250,000
for ordering his employees to attempt to bribe a U.S. Customs
officer into letting them ship two Vietnam-era helicopters to West
Africa without the necessary licenses.
</P>
<P>
   Brown lobbied members of Congress on Sissoko's behalf and wrote
two letters to Attorney General Janet Reno urging her to use her
power to deport Sissoko before his sentence was completed. Reno
refused. Brown later visited Sissoko in prison and in West Africa.
</P>
<P>
   The car was paid for by Karim Pouye, whom Sissoko's attorney,
Thomas Spencer of Miami, described as Sissoko's chief financial
officer.
</P>
<P>
   Shantrel Brown, who lives in Washington with her mother, issued
a written statement this month denying that the car had anything to
do with her mother's efforts to help Sissoko. She said Pouye, whom
she had met in Miami in 1997 and knew was affiliated with Sissoko,
gave her the car after she told him that her grandmother's car had
been stolen in Jacksonville.
</P>
<P>
   ``This conversation led to Mr. Pouye's offer of a car, first for
her, later titled to me,'' Shantrel Brown said, without explaining
why she got the car and not her grandmother.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew that the offer was made in friendship, and I accepted
it without reservation,'' she said. ``My mother was not present in
these conversations, and she had no part in my decision to accept
the car. I am an adult who makes my own decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   The third controversy involves a trip Brown and two aides took
to Russia and other countries of the former Soviet Union in 1996.
The 10-day trip, which cost $27,861, was paid for by Itera
International Energy Corp. of Jacksonville.
</P>
<P>
   Five months later, Brown wrote a high-pressure letter to the
ambassador of Turkmenistan complaining that Itera was being cut out
of a plan to ship natural gas between Turkmenistan and the Ukraine.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is my hope that any agreement will include my constituent
and that the United States and the state of Florida, where my
district is located, will continue to have close and warm ties with
Turkmenistan,'' Brown wrote.
</P>
<P>
   House ethics rules prohibit members from attempting to ``exert
undue or improper pressure'' on a foreign government.
</P>
<P>
   Two Florida Republican lawmakers _ Reps. Mark Foley of West Palm
Beach and C.W. ``Bill'' Young of Indian Rocks Beach _ have called
for a House ethics committee investigation of Brown, but in the
unwritten tradition of the Florida delegation, neither has filed
formal charges against her.
</P>
<P>
   Linder, the GOP congressional campaign chairman, has been
quietly looking for a member to file charges. Even if they are
filed, however, it is unlikely the investigation would be completed
before the election.
</P>
<P>
   The controversies surrounding Brown have been reported in local
newspapers in her district, but what affect they will have on her
election is unclear.
</P>
<P>
   ``The recent news stories ... have helped her to consolidate the
black Democratic base,'' said John H. Libby, president of American
Public Dialogue, a public opinion and marketing research firm with
close ties to Republican candidates. ``We've seen this historically
in this country with African-American politicians, particularly
congress people.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown and her opponent, Randall, are both black.
</P>
<P>
   Since the federal panel redrew the district's boundaries two
years ago, the percentage of black voters has dropped from 50
percent to about 42 percent. But it is still overwhelmingly
Democratic: 68 percent against 24 percent Republican and 8 percent
independent, according to Libby.
</P>
<P>
   With little support from black voters and with Republicans
distinctly in the minority, Randall's hopes lie with white
Democratic voters, Libby said.
</P>
<P>
   While Brown has more campaign money to spend than Randall _
$87,252 to $13,171 _ the pace of his fund raising in recent months
has been two-and-a-half times greater than hers. During the quarter
that ended June 30, Randall raised $31,216 to Brown's $12,255.

 &HT;    RUSSIA'S FEARED HORSEMEN TO RIDE AGAIN -- AS CRIME-BUSTERS
 &HT;    For Use Saturday, July 25 And Thereafter.
 &HT;    By CHARLES W. HOLMES 
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PETERSBURG, Russia _ In bygone centuries the Cossacks were
loyal servants of Russia's czars who struck fear in the hearts of
their victims. They had a deserved reputation as expert horsemen
and merciless killers.
</P>
<P>
   This tradition-steeped warrior caste soon will ride again.
</P>
<P>
   St. Petersburg officials plan to use Cossacks to patrol city
parks and assist regular police in fighting crime -- a variation of
the Guardian Angels, Russo-style.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there is organized crime, why not an organized defense?''
said Arkady Kramarev, leader of the 2,000-strong Cossack community
of St. Petersburg and member of the local legislature.
</P>
<P>
   ``Criminals are really afraid of the Cossacks. The moment they
realize there are Cossacks on horseback they will run away,'' he
added.
</P>
<P>
   The city's new police chief, Viktor Vlasov, has embraced the
idea and plans a pilot project this summer to deploy groups of 10
to 15 Cossacks in various city parks, where they will be supervised
by police officers.
</P>
<P>
   For now, he said, they will not carry swords, guns or weapons of
any kind. The local government is debating just how large the
contingents of Cossacks should be, whether they should be placed on
routine duty and whether they should be armed.
</P>
<P>
   Implicit in the plan is the reality that Russia's police force,
ill-equipped and rife with corruption, is losing the war on crime
that sprang from the economic upheaval following the Soviet Union's
demise in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   The Cossacks arose in the 15th century from a loose community of
peasants, outlaws and mercenaries along Russia's southern border.
The nobility granted them freedom and other considerations in
exchange for defending the frontier against Turks, Tartars and
other invading tribes.
</P>
<P>
   Today throughout Russia, the Cossacks are undergoing a revival
of sorts after being submerged for decades by the Soviet Union.
Russians are seeking to learn more about their Cossack roots. Armed
Cossack paramilitary units have been formed in some areas of
southern Russia, home to most of the country's estimated 10 million
Cossack descendants.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, Russian Interior Minister Sergei Stepashin
endorsed the idea of employing Cossack units along the country's
troublesome southern flank in the breakaway republic of Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   Human rights groups have warned that Cossacks, with their ardent
patriotism and imperial origins, are potentially dangerous.
Cossacks earned their fearsome reputation in part by hounding and
executing Jews and other minorities during czarist times.
</P>
<P>
   ``Attempts to flirt with the Cossack movement will lead to no
good,'' Sergei Kovalyov, a parliament member and human rights
advocate, told a news conference last fall.
</P>
<P>
   His human rights group, Memorial, issued a report in October
1997 which condemned the use of Cossacks and other nationalist
groups by the local authorities in the southern region of
Krasnodar. Regional administrators were encouraging the groups to
help impose order yet also ``inciting them to violence'' against
ethnic minorities, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   President Boris Yeltsin -- sometimes called ``Czar Boris'' given
his powerful place in Russian politics -- has encouraged the
revival of the Cossack's culture and tradition. But after the 1996
presidential race, the Kremlin rejected an offer by Cossacks to
form an elite presidential guard.
</P>
<P>
   St. Petersburg officials insist that their law-abiding Cossacks
will supplement, not supplant, the regular police. They already
have demonstrated their effectiveness, the police chief said.
</P>
<P>
   In his former job as head of the transportation police in the
northwestern region, Vlasov in 1993 established Cossack foot
patrols at stations and on trains traveling to and from St.
Petersburg. The idea came to him amid a wave of attacks on
passengers, and it worked. Crime aboard trains dropped and the
patrols continue today -- with no recorded complaints.
</P>
<P>
   Kramarev, the Cossack ``ataman'' or leader, also points to a
tourism dividend for the former imperial capital. Cossacks on
horseback, with traditional sheepskin hats and colorful uniforms
reminiscent of their 19th-century garb, would be an entertaining
addition to the landscape of grand palaces and palatial parks, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Keeping with tradition, the Cossacks will not be paid. They will
provide their own horses, but the city will help them with the
costs of feeding and caring for the animals.
</P>
<P>
   In imperial times, Cossacks were exempt from taxes and allowed
to retain the booty from their marauding. Vlasov said ``a certain
system of incentives,'' which he did not specify, will be set up
for St. Petersburg's Cossacks based on their performance -- the
more arrests they help police make, the more perks they'll receive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, the Cossacks are restoring their own society all over
Russia,'' said Vlasov, whose wife comes from a Cossack family.
``For them it is important to feel they are contributing to the
life of the city and are useful.''

WHO WILL STOP THE RAIN? THE MAYOR WILL

<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Tamara Volkova hates holidays.
</P>
<P>
   Volkova, an engineer for the Mir space station's mission
control, lives in a northwest suburb of Moscow. And whenever the
Russian capital celebrates a special occasion, she prepares for
rain _ lots of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rain, rain, rain, rain,'' Volkova grumbled. ``Every time they
put on a big show, we get downpours.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They'' is the city of Moscow, which on Sunday wrapped up the
first annual World Youth Games, an athletic competition that city
officials hope will boost their campaign to bring the Summer
Olympic Games back to Moscow in 2012.
</P>
<P>
   Fearing that Mother Nature might rain on Moscow's parade, City
Hall did what it often does on special days: It sent a squadron of
cloud-seeding planes into the skies to ensure fair weather for the
opening and closing ceremonies.
</P>
<P>
   Seeding does not evaporate rain clouds; it makes them dump their
precipitation someplace else. And in the case of Moscow, that
someplace is usually the northwestern suburb where Volkova lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all have rain on the brain,'' Volkova grumbled. ``We pay
the price for their sunshine in Moscow.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, not entirely. Designer weather is an expensive proposition
for Moscow. The city set aside some $400,000 to chase the clouds
away, although the actual cost may be more, according to Anatoly
Yakovlev of Russia's federal weather service, whose specialists do
the seeding.
</P>
<P>
   Given that Moscow, like the rest of Russia, is chronically short
of funds, spending so much money on the weather may seem frivolous.
But that is not how Moscow officials see it, not in a city whose
name derives from an ancient Slavic word for ``wet.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Was the money well spent? Yes,'' said Galina Sugak of the
Moscow mayor's office. ``Otherwise we would have spent this
important occasion sitting in a constant shower of rain.''
</P>
<P>
   Lots of places use cloud seeding to prevent dangerous hail or as
an aid to farmers. But the former Soviet Union does vanity cloud
seeding.
</P>
<P>
   Clouds were seeded on many a May Day and during the 1980 Summer
Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   For a Soviet leadership that irrigated deserts, built big cities
in the tundra, and tried to reverse the flow of rivers, a little
climate control was a drop in the bucket by comparison.
</P>
<P>
   Moscow's ambitious mayor, Yury Luzhkov, who likes to put on big
events to show off his city, has made meteorological manipulation
one of his trademarks. Last September, planes kept the skies clear
for three days during Luzhkov's celebration of the city's 850th
anniversary.
</P>
<P>
   The principle of cloud seeding is fairly simple. Clouds are made
up of tiny droplets of water that become rain when the droplets
grow heavy enough to fall. The planes douse the clouds with
chemicals that make the droplets expand and fall before the clouds
get to Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   People in the suburbs do not like it, but no one complains too
loudly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Russia still does not have the kind of civil society where
people stand up and say, `Why do we have to accept their rain on
our heads?''' the weather service's Yakovlev observed.
</P>
<P>
   And cloud seeding for odd anniversaries and dubious occasions is
catching on throughout the former Soviet Union. Among the weather
service's recent clients was the southern Russian city of
Stavropol, which eliminated the chance of rain on its 220th
anniversary.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, the clouds are too thick, or the storm fronts too
numerous, for cloud seeding to prevent rain. That looked to be the
case for the July 13 opening festivities of the World Youth Games.
</P>
<P>
   But Luzhkov, who had workers spruce up the city and police ship
homeless people out of Moscow to prepare for the games, ordered the
cloud seeders to redouble their efforts. The seeding did not
completely stop the rain.
</P>
<P>
   ``But when Mr. Luzhkov opened the games, there was a ray of
sun,'' Yakovlev said. ``And so he was happy.''

 2 vaccines on track to curb Lyme disease
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Not one but two vaccines to prevent Lyme disease _ the nation's
most common insect-borne infection with more than 16,000 cases in
1996 _ are on track toward final approval on the basis of studies
published Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The vaccines were between 76 and 92 percent effective in
preventing doughnut rash, fever, joint pain, and other symptoms of
the tick-bite disease after a series of three injections over a
one-year period, according to reports involving more than 21,000
adults that appear in the current New England Journal of Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   The drug companies behind the two vaccines are sparring over
which one is better, but Lyme disease experts said the results look
pretty comparable.
</P>
<P>
   One vaccine, developed by the French firm Pasteur Merieux
Connaught, lowered the risk of Lyme disease symptoms by 68 percent
in the first year after vaccination, and 92 percent among those who
got a one-year booster shot. But men over age 60 had a second-year
efficacy rate of 67 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The other, formulated by SmithKline Beecham Pharmaceuticals, had
a 49 percent efficacy rate in the first year and 76 percent after
the booster shot.
</P>
<P>
   But Dr. Allen C. Steere of New England Medical Center and Tufts
University Medical School noted that the SmithKline vaccine was 100
percent effective in preventing infections of the Lyme disease
organism that did not produce symptoms, at least not during the
study. That can be important, Steere said, because some percentage
of these asymptomatic infections can produce arthritis or
neurological disease months or years later.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we can say whether one is better than the
other,'' said Dr. Leonard H. Sigal of the Robert Wood Johnson
Medical School in New Brunswick, New Jersey, who led the test of
the Pasteur Merieux product. ``What one can say is the two vaccines
are safe and effective.''
</P>
<P>
   Tests in children, who suffer 23 percent of reported Lyme
disease cases, are just beginning. Researchers and the drug
companies hope to get approval for the adult vaccines before ticks
carrying Lyme disease begin biting next spring.
</P>
<P>
   Steere and Sigal said the vaccines should be targeted to people
living in high-risk areas such as the south coast of New England
who are likely to be exposed to ticks carrying the Lyme disease
organism. But Dr. John M. Zahradnik, Pasteur Merieux's director of
clinical research, said: ``The people who are going to get the
vaccine are those who really want it.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; Heart risk found high for type 2 diabetics
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Here's a red flag for people with type 2 diabetes and their
doctors: Even if they have not had a heart attack, their risk of
having one or dying from coronary disease is just as high as
nondiabetic individuals who have suffered heart attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Diabetics' coronary risk, reported in a study in the current New
England Journal of Medicine, was surprisingly high, said Dr. Steven
M. Haffner of the University of Texas Health Sciences Center in San
Antonio, the study's first author.
</P>
<P>
   Among diabetics with no prior history of heart attacks, 20
percent suffered one over a seven-year period. If they had had a
heart attack, their chances of suffering a second one jumped to 45
percent. Nondiabetics had a 3.5 percent chance of a first-time
heart attack and a 19 percent risk of a repeat attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``The implication is that very aggressive treatment of diabetics
may be important,'' Haffner said. That means diet and medicine to
lower elevated blood pressure and cholesterol, vigorous weight
control and smoking cessation, and exercise.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; Itching for a mango? Beware those rinds
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   What do mangos and poison ivy have in common? A 27-year-old
Texas man discovered the answer was as clear as the palm of his
hand.
</P>
<P>
   After peeling a mango, the man rested his hand on his thigh
while talking on the telephone. He subsequently suffered an itchy
red rash on his leg in the shape of his hand, a picture of which
appears in the current New England Journal of Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   When he was a boy, the man had been sensitized to poison ivy and
poison oak, said Dr. Mark O. Tucker and Dr. Chad R. Swan of St.
Joseph Hospital in Houston. The sap in mango rind contains resins
similar enough to those in the poisonous plants to confuse the
immune system.

SHINING A LIGHT ON THREE HOT PERENNIALS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CAROL STOCKER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   American gardeners have become recreational shoppers, browsing
nurseries and catalogs for new flowers that will give them
something unusual to enjoy in their gardens and to show off to
their friends. Through stepped-up breeding programs, international
trade, and plant exploration, nurseries are filling this demand.
New plants were high on the agenda of the 900 garden professionals
who attended the national meeting of the Perennial Plant
Association here in Boston earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   Three rising stars of the perennial border that enjoyed the
spotlight at the symposium were hellebores, geraniums, and
clematis.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
------- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Hellebores are some of the hottest plants available right
now,'' said Thomas Fischer, executive editor of Boston-based
Horticulture magazine, who maintains a 60-foot border of the newest
hellebore hybrids in his Jamaica Plain garden.
</P>
<P>
   The reason? A March bloomtime when not much else is going on in
the garden, and an explosion in new forms and colors produced by
breeders overseas.
</P>
<P>
   Fischer thinks hellebores are the perfect perennial for shade.
``Keep your hostas and hemerocallis _ give me H. xhybridus!'' he
said at the symposium at the Westin Hotel at Copley Place.
</P>
<P>
   Often called ``orientalis hybrids,'' H. orientalis, or Lenten
rose, the popular garden hellebore is actually a genetic mishmash
of various hellebore species, said Fischer. Available only in murky
shades of green, white, or purple a few years ago, the 2-inch
flowers now come in clear new tones of yellow, apricot, maroon, and
pink. There are also picotee flowers (with colored rims) and
doubles that look almost like perfect miniature peonies, quite a
prize when snow is still on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   A partly shaded hillside that you can see from inside the house
(since they bloom so early) is the ideal location for this tough
little plant that only requests good drainage. The foot- high
foliage is evergreen, but so battered by winter's end that it
should be cut to the ground as new foliage and buds emerge.
</P>
<P>
   Since these slow growers can't be reproduced through ``test
tube'' methods, young plants are seed-grown and expensive. Fischer
urges gardeners to grow their own from fresh seed (see sidebar), a
three-year process. He buys seeds from Gisela Schmiemann of
Cologne, Germany, who has improved on a base of stock plants from
the late Helen Ballard, the century's premier hellebore breeder.
</P>
<P>
   But there are so many of the new hellebores in production now
that an onslaught of potted plants will soon arrive. For instance,
Briggs Nursery of Olympia, Wash., will be shipping 100,000 mostly
red and pink hellebores of the new Royal Heritage(TM) strain to
regional nurseries this fall and they should begin appearing for
sale next spring.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
------- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Hardy geraniums are a passion of Robert Herman, new director of
horticulture at White Flower Farm, the Litchfield, Conn., catalog
giant. Herman spoke at the Perennial Plant Association symposium.
</P>
<P>
   Americans have long preferred its ubiquitous cousin, the potted
annual geranium, which sports stiff bright lollipops of color all
summer. In contrast, hardy geraniums look lax and informal as
wildflowers, with many blooming in watercolor tones of pink, blue,
and purple.
</P>
<P>
   ``They fit in with the new design trends. People want a relaxed,
natural garden with very little maintenance, and these plants have
almost no insect or disease problems,'' said Herman.
</P>
<P>
   The most exciting is Brookside, which has the desirable blue
flowers of longtime-favorite Johnson's Blue but blooms three times
as long.
</P>
<P>
   White Flower Farm is greatly expanding its geranium offerings.
This fall they offer the new Alpenglow, a prolific carmine red
selection of Geranium saguineum.
</P>
<P>
   Geraniums are treasured for a long bloom period from late May
through July. Some new cultivars are extending that into fall,
including Ann Folkard, with purple flowers and chartreuse spring
foliage, and Mavis Simpson. Another is Patricia, one of some 350
crosses made by reclusive Alan Bremner of the Orkney Islands off
Scotland.
</P>
<P>
   Next spring WFF will offer Bremner's Phillippe Vapelle, a cross
that combines the lovely foliage of G. renardii and the large
purple flowers of G. platypetalum. Also being offered next spring
are Rosemoor, a selection of G. magnificum with large violet
flowers, and the unusual deep pink Sirek, both new selections from
Dr. Hans Simon of Germany.
</P>
<P>
   There are so many different geraniums becoming available, in
fact, that you need a score card to make your selections. Herman
has one and it goes like this: G. wlassovianum has the best fall
foliage color; Lily Lovell is the prettiest G. phaeum for dry, part
shade; Spinners has the bluest flowers; Brookside is the longest
blooming blue; G. cantabrigiense makes the best ground cover with
great fall color; G. oxonianum Claridge Druce is the
fastest-growing if you want a more rampant ground cover; A.T.
Johnson is the best of the carefree oxonianum geranium varieties
for looks and good behavior; and Amy Doncaster is the best
sylvaticum geranium for dappled shade or a woodland's edge.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
------- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Since Sue Austin opened her Completely Clematis Specialist
Nursery in Ipswich 13 years ago, her business has doubled every
year. (Austin also spoke at the Perennial Plant Association
symposium.)
</P>
<P>
   Americans are discovering new ways of displaying clematis, such
as letting them clamber up beanpole tripods in the middle of the
border, or up lilacs, cedars, and other trees and shrubs.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are more interested in climbers and structures now,''
said Austin. ``But you can have clematis without having walls for
them to climb on. Let them ramble. I have Polish Spirit running
around in the border. They weave. I say let them rip.'' In short,
don't truss them up like Joan of Arc on the stake.
</P>
<P>
   Austin obviously favors a relaxed approach. ``It doesn't matter
if you undercut or overcut. And if you don't like where they're
growing, most clematis are easy to transplant.'' But she does urge
gardeners to plant new clematis several inches deeper than where
the stem starts growing so they can produce new shoots if disaster
befalls them.
</P>
<P>
   Austin is a champion of small-flowered clematis, which though
less flashy and widely available than their large-flowered cousins,
are winning fans for their toughness and resistance to dreaded
clematis wilt.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the breeding is taking place in Europe and Japan.
``There are plenty of new ones and some of the new introductions
are great. Barry Fretwell of England is breeding a lot with the
small-flowered viticellas, alpinas, and macropetalas,'' Austin
said, citing three species of small-flowered clematis. ``He created
C. alpina Jacqueline du Pre, which has small bells of a bright
pink. We brought the new small-flowered C. albina Helsingborg and
C. macropetala Jan Lindmark into this country, which were bred by
Magnus Johnson of Sweden.''
</P>
<P>
   People are ``nuts for fragrance now,'' said Austin. All the
montana clematis are sweetly scented, especially the new Mayleen.''
She also recommends C. rehderiana and C. recta for scent.
</P>
<P>
   Most clematis breeding takes place abroad. Even the new
red-flowered Clematis texansis Lady Bird Johnson comes from
England, though it traces its wild roots back to Texas. ``It's a
wonderful plant, but the name's a marketing ploy,'' said Austin.
But no marketing ploy can outdo the Princess Diana clematis, an old
variety that was recently renamed. ``It used to be called The
Princess of Wales, but since it's been around for 50 or 60 years,''
said Austin, ``it was originally named for a different princess.''

MEN WHO LIVE ON A DIFFERENT PLANET 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LINDA WELTNER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Back in the days when I was inordinately fond of male attention,
I met a handsome guy at a cocktail party. He was unhappily married,
he told me, looking deep into my eyes. His wife not only didn't
understand him, she neglected him, leaving him to watch television
by himself night after night while she fiddled in the kitchen or
busied herself upstairs.
</P>
<P>
   My heart went out to this poor guy who was being abandoned every
evening in spite of his smoldering eyes and seductive gaze.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is she doing with herself, do you think?'' I asked,
trying to fathom how any woman in her right mind could be so
foolish.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's fussing over the kids,'' he replied.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have kids? How old are they?'' I asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``One, 3 and 6,'' he said with a shrug. He was eager to get back
to more congenial topics like ways I could help to brighten his
life.
</P>
<P>
   ``You mean she's cleaning up after dinner and putting three
little kids to bed alone and you resent that she's not watching TV
with you?'' He was flattered by my response. He took the wild look
in my eyes to mean I was getting excited, but a friend, who noticed
that I was pawing the ground like a maddened bull, hurried over,
took me by the shoulders, and led me away before I did him serious
harm.
</P>
<P>
   Let me say here that I know that not all men are this lazy, this
self-centered, or this insensitive. Let me reassure you that in the
stories that follow, the men in question bear no resemblance to the
man I married, any husband of any of my friends, or any man I have
ever met in this or any former life. These stories are strictly
hearsay, unreliable gossip about the habits of a group of men who
dwell on the western rim of Saturn's innermost ring. I retell them
here only to make us all deliriously happy that we do not have guys
like this on our planet.
</P>
<P>
   For example, there was a fellow who was convinced that the woman
in his life liked making things unnecessarily difficult? He tried
to be helpful by saying things like, ``Sweets, don't make this
harder than it has to be,'' or ``Relax, hon. We can let that go
another week.'' He was known far and wide as the man who never saw
a refrigerator that needed to be cleaned or a dish that needed to
be washed. He considered it his valuable contribution to the
relationship that he could always decrease the volume of work
needed to be done (while he was around).
</P>
<P>
   Then there was the guy who took housework so seriously that he
insisted upon taking full responsibility for his part. When he
emptied the dishwasher, he'd sing ``I did it my way'' at the top of
his lungs as he carefully tucked the serving utensils into the
drawer with the frying pans. This fellow felt deeply hurt when
criticized. The injured tone in which he delivered, ``Well, if you
wanted it done a certain way, you should have done it yourself,''
is currently being replayed on a Web site called
busydivorcelawyersofamerica.com.
</P>
<P>
   How about the guy whose only reason for ever sitting down was
because it was the best position in which to wait to be asked? He
never heard the dirty dishes ask, ``Will you wash me?'' or the
trash begging to be taken out. He was waiting for specific
instructions from his significant other, preferably in writing, at
which time it is presumed he would have swung into immediate
action. We will never know, however, because one night, when his
wife climbed into bed, she discovered their dog had died there
hours earlier. The poor man never did understand why she was upset
that he hadn't removed the body. Puzzled to the end, his final
words were, ``All she had to do was ask me.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there are the romantic guys who can always be counted upon
to fend off housework by whispering into a delicate ear, ``Let's
forget about all this and go have fun.'' There are the athletes who
are indefatigable on the golf course, only to find themselves
fading fast after folding two king-size sheets. There are the poor
CEOs who cannot figure out how to run a washing machine for the
life of them. Soul-searchers all, they rate themselves all the way
from ``extremely helpful'' to ``supremely helpful,'' while
bemoaning the lack of mathematical ability in females that prevents
an accurate assessment of the size of their contribution.
</P>
<P>
   The latest reports from Saturn indicate that the few women who
have not taken the easy way out and flung themselves off the edge
of a ring have fled the galaxy, making even more remarkable the
conflict-free existence led by so many loving helpmates here on
Earth.

TWO JERRYS CALLING JORDAN'S BLUFF 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB RYAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The two Jerrys are about to declare official war on Michael
Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Floyd has resigned at Iowa State and is now in Chicago. If
Jerry Reinsdorf and Jerry Krause name Floyd coach of the Chicago
Bulls, they are declaring that a rookie college mentor is more
important to the team than Michael Jordan. What other conclusion
can anyone draw?
</P>
<P>
   At the very least, the Jerrys are calling Jordan's bluff. No. 23
has said repeatedly that he would not play for anyone other than
Phil Jackson, who resigned at the conclusion of the playoffs. But
Michael has occasionally softened that stance, indicating that in
his mind, there still is some wiggle room on the issue, except that
said wiggle room specifically excluded Tim Floyd, scarred for life
in Jordan's mind as an FOK (Friend of Krause).
</P>
<P>
   It is a truly bizarre situation. Here, on the one hand, is the
world's greatest player, still a clear step or two ahead of the
field. Here, on the other hand, is a college coach of modest
accomplishment. Jordan vs. Floyd ... which way will the city of
Chicago go? Tough call, eh?
</P>
<P>
   Without Jordan, the Bulls are just another fairly decent team.
In terms of winning a seventh championship, it really doesn't
matter who coaches them if Michael isn't around. Floyd adds
nothing. If I were a Bulls fan, I would be apoplectic.
</P>
<P>
   Basketball fans in Moscow, Idaho; New Orleans; and Ames, Iowa,
know who Tim Floyd is. Dedicated readers of the Blue Ribbon
Basketball Yearbook know who Tim Floyd is. But Michael Jordan
doesn't know who Tim Floyd is, and he doesn't care, either. Michael
doesn't have the patience to wet-nurse a college coach.
</P>
<P>
   This is a Jerry Krause production, pure and simple. It speaks to
the astounding faith and confidence Mr. Reinsdorf has in his
secretive general manager. The Jerrys (itals)might(unitals) _ I
stress the word _ have been able to sell both Jordan and the
Chicago basketball public on a George Karl or even a Paul Silas.
Jordan might very well have decided he could easily live with
Silas. But this college guy has no shot, especially since his claim
to Windy City fame is that he is a fishing buddy of the
much-despised general manager.
</P>
<P>
   The Jordan camp is hardly in need of smelling salts. ``I think
it would have been a shock to anyone close to the scene if Tim
Floyd had (itals)not(unitals) been hired,'' David Falk told the
Associated Press. ``This was a decision that was made a year ago.''
Falk, in case you don't know, is the superagent whose great fortune
in life is to represent Michael Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   Well, they may say that, but having the name out there is one
thing, and it now being an apparent reality is another. You'd hear
it and you'd think about it and you'd say, ``Nah.'' You'd run all
the possible candidates through your mind and you'd wind up saying,
``Tim Floyd? Why?'' You just couldn't believe that Jerry Krause
would be brazen enough to do it, because there could be no surer
way of driving Michael Jordan away than by selecting as Phil
Jackson's successor an inexperienced college coach (itals)who
actually enjoys sitting in a boat for hours on end with Jerry
Krause.(unitals) If you happen to be Michael Jordan, that is an
incomprehensible thought.
</P>
<P>
   Floyd's name has been in the public discourse for at least two
years. There was a mild flap last summer when Floyd was invited to
the wedding of a Krause daughter and Jackson wasn't. Krause
attempted to defuse that by explaining that the Krauses and
Jacksons have never really socialized and that in his view, a
wedding invitation was supposed to be for a friend, not a business
associate. At no point in the past two years had Krause actually
acknowledged any intention of naming Floyd coach.
</P>
<P>
   But then, Krause is not known as ``The Sleuth'' without reason,
is he? As Jerry himself has said many times, ``I don't want
everyone to know my business.''
</P>
<P>
   Krause watchers think naming Floyd is a classic Krause-like move
because Krause has spent the last decade searching for a coach who
would let him be a buddy. But what's with Reinsdorf? ``This is one
of the great mysteries of life,'' marvels a longtime NBA insider.
``Jerry Reinsdorf has a choice between Phil Jackson and Jerry
Krause, and guess what. He has a choice between Michael Jordan and
Jerry Krause, and guess what. He has a choice between Scottie
Pippen and Jerry Krause, and guess what. Amazing.''
</P>
<P>
   'Tis said there is nothing new under the sun, and that's the
gospel truth, because what's going on in Chicago is no different in
the essentials than what took place here in Boston 32 years ago.
Red Auerbach had announced his retirement, and the Celtics needed a
coach. The only catch was that Red knew very well that the team's
key player was such a singular presence that he wouldn't play for
just anybody. This is just one more example of the amazing parallel
between Bill Russell and Michael Jordan, the two greatest winners
the sport of basketball has ever known. Anyway, Red gently tossed
one name at Russell (some say it was then Brandeis coach Bob
Brannum, a former Celtic for whom Red had enormous fondness), and
Russell demurred.
</P>
<P>
   At that point, Red went to Plan B. Figuring that Russell
wouldn't be comfortable playing for anyone but himself, he made him
player-coach. The Celtics won two more championships.
</P>
<P>
   I'm sure that was never an option in Chicago, because the NBA
has been allowed to get too complicated. The idea of a player-coach
in a league where teams routinely have three assistant coaches
(this past season, the Bulls had four) and where there is
micromanagement of every offensive possession is unthinkable.
</P>
<P>
   But that's what I would have done.
</P>
<P>
   What's the big deal? Tex Winter is still there, and the Bulls
could still run his triple-post offense. Frank Hamblen and Bill
Cartwright are still there, and they could be the general eyes and
ears on the bench while Michael is out on the floor. Michael is the
conscience of the team as it is. If he didn't like the way someone
was playing, he could get the offending party out of the game any
time he liked.
</P>
<P>
   I mean it. The logistical details could be worked out. Michael
would have what he always wants and probably deserves: namely, the
final say. The Russell-Jordan parallel is perfect. Russell was just
as important to the Celtics 32 years ago as Jordan is to the Bulls
today.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the ultimate game of chicken with the world's greatest
athlete,'' says our insider. ``And the two people who are
shuddering the most today are David Stern and Dick Ebersol.''
</P>
<P>
   The fact is that Jerry Reinsdorf is making a choice between
Jerry Krause and Michael Jordan, and he is choosing Jerry Krause. I
certainly understand why Jerry Krause has always insisted that
Jerry Reinsdorf is the greatest owner in sports.
</P>
<P>
   I suspect that in Chicago, Mr. Krause holds a minority opinion.

WALK-ONS PART OF PARKING LOT BARD IN NEW YORK CITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRED KAPLAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Nowhere in Act One of ``Othello'' does Shakespeare
call for an old Chinese woman to lumber across the stage, but one
did just that the other night in a production of the play put on by
the Expanded Arts theater company.
</P>
<P>
   Such things happen all the time in this company's shows, for
they are performed in an outdoor parking lot on Manhattan's Lower
East Side.
</P>
<P>
   You've probably heard of ``Shakespeare in the Park'' _ the late
producer Joseph Papp's celebrated idea of staging Shakespeare plays
for free in Central Park. Well, Expanded Arts took the concept a
few steps further and launched ``Shakespeare in the Parking Lot.''
</P>
<P>
   And sometimes the neighborhood's stragglers, sirens, screaming
children, and oblivious passersby become as much a part of the
action as the actors.
</P>
<P>
   ``The locale definitely has its problems,'' said Jennifer Spahr,
the company's 30-year-old executive director, laughing. ``But we
try to turn the problems into assets.''
</P>
<P>
   Spahr remembers three summers ago, during the series' first
season, when, right in the middle of ``A Midsummer Night's Dream,''
a garbage truck roared into the parking lot at the same time each
night.
</P>
<P>
   Figuring there was no way to outshout the noise, the cast made
the truck a part of the show, bowing before it as if it were some
sort of chariot of the gods.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, during a ``Road Warrior''-like modernization of
``Macbeth,'' a member of a real-life youth gang who was watching
the show one night hopped on the motorcycle that Macduff had ridden
on to the set. When the show's director discreetly asked the
interloper to get off the bike, the teen tough pulled out a knife.
</P>
<P>
   The crisis was resolved when the actors _ dressed like
street-gang punks themselves _ came growling over to the bike with
their clubs, hubcaps, and various other weapon-props, and scared
the kid off.
</P>
<P>
   Spahr and her husband, Robert, who codirects Expanded Arts, got
the idea for their peculiar variation on street theater shortly
after they moved their company's slightly more legitimate indoor
theater from the East Village to Ludlow Street, a half-block south
of Delancey. (They live with their 2-year-old son, Zachary, in an
apartment above the theater.)
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very small theater, and we would look out on this
enormous parking lot across the street, and notice that it wasn't
used at night,'' she recalled. ``It was an empty space. And I
couldn't help think of Peter Brook's line that all empty spaces can
be theaters.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the lot is city-owned, she made inquiries at the
Department of Transportation, which directed her to the local
Community Board and Business Improvement District, which told her
she would have to get residents to sign a petition, stating it was
fine with them to play host to an outdoor theater.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well,'' Spahr went on, ``almost nobody in the neighborhood
spoke English, so I went to someone at the Baskin Robbins and had
him translate the petition into Chinese.'' She then went around,
stopping people on the street and showing them the document. More
than 250 signed it.
</P>
<P>
   She and her husband still argue over which one of them came up
with the inspired moniker, Shakespeare in the Parking Lot.
``Whoever it was, we just died laughing when we first heard it,''
she recalled. ``We couldn't believe nobody had ever thought of it
before.''
</P>
<P>
   The spectators, who usually number around 100 and sit on folding
chairs, tend to be young _ mainly under 30 _ but otherwise reflect
the diversity of the area. There are the alternative-theater mavens
who cross Delancey from SoHo and the Bowery; the Chinese teens from
around the corner, who come to gawk and jeer but sometimes stay,
entranced; the Hasidic Jews, who dwell in the high-rises near the
Williamsburg Bridge, a few blocks away; and those, from all over
town, who have spotted a blurb in the Village Voice or Time Out New
York and come out of sheer curiosity.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Papp's successors uptown have little cause for worry.
Shakespeare in the Parking Lot is, of necessity, a rather chintzy
affair. The backdrop for its ``stage'' is the graffiti-scrawled
brick wall of a T-shirt factory, not the spectacular sunset and
skyscrapers enveloping Central Park. There are few costumes and
fewer props. The actors are unpaid.
</P>
<P>
   Near the beginning of ``Othello,'' when the script calls for
Desdemona's father to lean out his bedroom window after being
awakened by Iago and Roderigo, this production must settle for
having him stand atop the foot-high ledge of a sign reading ``4
Hour Parking Limit _ 25(cents) Per 20 Minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah,'' Spahr said, smiling, ``we're not the Publick, but I
hope there's a certain heart and soul here that you don't find
elsewhere.''

A BETTER MOUSE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HIAWATHA BRAY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   At first glance, the Anir Mouse from Animax International of
Oslo, doesn't look like a computer mouse at all _ more like a
mutant joystick. Then there's the name: What's an Anir? Some
ill-tempered Norse god?
</P>
<P>
   But then I wrapped my hand around it for a few weeks and
realized that the Anir Mouse is the most comfortable device of its
kind I've ever touched.
</P>
<P>
   You can understand why the $50 Anir Mouse is so comfortable
simply by resting your forearm on a table. Just plop it down on the
surface. Now notice how it's lying. Chances are that most of the
weight is resting on the outer edge of your arm and hand, with your
thumb facing upward.
</P>
<P>
   The designers of the Anir Mouse have created a device that takes
advantage of this natural resting position of the arm. With a
standard mouse, you twist the wrist to put your hand in the right
position, and to slide the mouse around. It's a slight effort, but
hours of mousing around can take a toll on your arm.
</P>
<P>
   With the Anir Mouse, I simply drop the edge of my hand on the
base and curl my fingers around the grip. My thumb rests easily on
a rocker switch at the top of the grip. I can make left or right
mouse clicks simply by tilting my thumb from side to side. A third
mouse switch is embedded in the grip, where I can click it with the
slightest pressure.
</P>
<P>
   To move the mouse, I just pivot my elbow from side to side or
pull it back and forth from the shoulder. I never have to twist my
wrist.
</P>
<P>
   It took me a day or two to get used to the way the Anir Mouse
works. For example, to use it properly, you must rest your forearm
on the desk. That means the Anir Mouse will take up more room on
your desk than a traditional mouse. But what you lose in desk space
you gain in comfort.

NETSCAPE HOPING SURFERS WILL COME TO THE RESCUE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HIAWATHA BRAY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Netscape Communications Corp. has taken quite a beating from
Microsoft Corp. But so far, there's no sign of brain damage.
</P>
<P>
   Netscape once held over 80 percent of the market for Internet
browsers, with people paying up to $79 a copy. Today the company
is &UR;  &LR; forced to give them away, and still Netscape's market share
dwindles _ it's &UR;  &LR; down to about 52 percent now, with Microsoft at 45
percent and gaining fast.
</P>
<P>
   And there's no longer much hope of relief from that federal
antitrust case against Microsoft's browser-marketing practices.
Last month, a federal appeals court said that Microsoft has every
right to build its own browser directly into the Windows operating
system, even if it hurts Netscape's business. And whatever the
final outcome of the case, it'll likely come far too late to
provide Netscape with any relief.
</P>
<P>
   Desperation time? I'll say. But you can be desperate and shrewd
at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; I've been playing with a beta-test version of the newest
Netscape browser software, Communicator 4.5. For the most part it's
just another browser, with some fresh new bugs added. But Netscape
has added some clever new features that will appeal to serious Web
surfers, while setting the stage for Netscape's plan for long-term
survival.
</P>
<P>
   Having fallen on hard times in the software business, Netscape
is now trying to become an Internet media company. Already its
Netcenter Web site is one of the 10 most visited Web sites, largely
because users of Communicator get taken automatically to the
Netcenter home page.
</P>
<P>
   The newest Communicator features reinforce this idea. Indeed,
every time you use the browser, it'll seek out ways to bring you
back to the Netcenter portal.  &UR;  &LR; Netscape is trying to drive traffic
to its portal, so it can attract paying advertisers and sponsors,
and so it can persuade you to shop at Netscape's on-line retail
mall.
</P>
<P>
   The company is doing this the right way _ with a system called
Smart Browsing that links Netcenter and the browser in ways that
make life easier for the common Web surfer.
</P>
<P>
   Say you're looking for Delta Airlines. These days, you'd
probably head to Yahoo or AltaVista to look up the Web address. Or
you could just type Delta Airlines in the address space of the new
Netscape browser.
</P>
<P>
   In a flash, the browser contacts Netcenter, where Netscape has
compiled an index of thousands of businesses and organizations. The
index finds a listing for Delta, and the company's Web address. The
information is relayed to your browser, and up pops the site.
</P>
<P>
   Netscape didn't invent this idea. Visit http://www.realnames.com
for a similar service. But Netscape is the first to build it right
into the browser. It's the best effort so far to liberate us from
the tyranny of typing dot-com. &UR;  &LR;  But there's more. Click a button
marked ``What's Related.'' Netcenter whips up a list of 10 other
Web sites with similar content, and flashes it on your screen. If
you change your mind about flying Delta, a couple of clicks takes
you to the Southwest Airlines site instead.
</P>
<P>
   You never even know you've paid a visit to Netcenter &UR;  &LR; _ &UR;  &LR; it all
happens behind the scenes. But say you want generic information on
a particular topic, like cars. When you type in the word
``automobiles,'' up pops Netcenter, with a listing of popular
automotive Web sites, and some strategically placed advertisements.
It's the ads that bring in the money, and by routing your eyes past
them, the browser will fatten up Netscape's cash flow.
</P>
<P>
   Not everybody likes this idea. Type a generic word in today's
browsers, and the browser simply adds a ``www'' in front and a
``.com'' in back. If you type ``automobiles'', you wind up at a
car-buff site called Automobiles.com. Knowing this, lots of
companies own generic-sounding Web addresses. But with the new
Netscape browser, type ``automobile'' and you go to a Netcenter
page with information on cars instead. This could hurt traffic at
many other Web sites. Several businesses are already complaining
about this, and Netscape is working on ways to mollify the
companies, perhaps by giving their sites a prominent space on
Netcenter.
</P>
<P>
   There's definitely a hint of desperation in Netscape's new
strategy. Here's a company that once thought to dominate the
Internet software business, reduced to scrabbling after the fickle
eyeballs of Web surfers. Oh, well. You do what you have to do, and
on the whole, Netscape is doing it rather well.

   Raymond Pifferrer's father, a Cuban-born janitor, threw him
through a window when he told his father he was gay.
</P>
<P>
   When Lawrence's Ingrid Rivera, 26, came out as a lesbian to her
Puerto Rican mother six years ago, she was told that she was still
loved, but that ``out of respect'' she should never raise the issue
again.
</P>
<P>
   And when Luiz Villalona-Perez, 34, filed a petition in
Massachusetts two years ago for political asylum from the Dominican
Republic _ on the grounds that he would be imprisoned or killed
there for his homosexuality _ human rights groups backed his
claims.
</P>
<P>
   A recent Christian Coalition campaign against homosexuality in
the nation's newspapers suggests that it is not easy to come out as
gay or lesbian in the United States, period. And rising regional
hate crimes against gays and lesbians, meanwhile, show that
Massachusetts, which likes to think of itself as a liberal mecca,
is no safe haven.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, to be Latino or Latina and homosexual in Massachusetts
can be particularly difficult, as demonstrated in May when Latino
parents in Lawrence organized to bus more than 200 children out of
state for a day rather than have them witness a gay pride parade in
that city.
</P>
<P>
   There are an estimated 17 subcultures embraced by the term
``Latino,'' encompassing nearly 35 million Americans. Within each
of those groups there are many races, classes, and levels of
acculturation. Nonetheless, research indicates that homophobia is
prevalent in many Latino communities in the United States, though
it generally becomes less severe as education and acculturation
levels increase. For example, when the South End's Russ Lopez, a
college student, came out to his middle-class, third-generation
Mexican-American parents in San Jose, Calif., he says, ``It was
really, totally no big deal.''
</P>
<P>
   But in Massachusetts, the majority of Latinos are young, first-
or second-generation immigrants or transplants from the Dominican
Republic and Puerto Rico, and as of 1990, were the poorest
Hispanics in the nation, according to the US Census. Poverty, low
educational levels, traditional religious and social values, and
rigid gender roles (i.e. machismo) in the local Latino population
have contributed to what Boston University social scientist
Hortencia Amaro calls ``narrow views on sexuality and gender roles
in general, and homophobia in particular.''
</P>
<P>
   While many traditional immigrant communities could be said to
hold similarly narrow views, the difficulties for gay and lesbian
Latinos are often amplified by the cultural norm of
``personalismo,'' a strong emphasis on the maintenance of smooth
social relations at any cost _ even if that requires telling
half-truths, remaining silent about problems, or lying about sexual
orientation to avoid conflict. Personalismo often conflicts with
the American idea that openness and self-expression are healthy.
</P>
<P>
   Peculiarly, the Latino culture of machismo dictates that a man
is gay only if he is the receiver in a homosexual encounter. Public
health officials say this is part of the reason Latinos nationwide
are more affected by the AIDS epidemic than is the Anglo
population. Although Latinos represent only 9 percent of the
national population, they make up 17 percent of all AIDS cases,
according to the Centers for Disease Control.
</P>
<P>
   For all of these reasons, there is widespread public denial of
homosexuality in the community, particularly among males, says
Luisa Medrano, a psychologist who works with Latino AIDS patients
at Massachusetts General Hospital. Often, she says, those infected
through gay sex prefer to tell their families they got AIDS from a
prostitute or from intravenous drug use. This, in turn, may also
skew regional AIDS statistics. The Northeastern United States, home
to many newly arrived Caribbean Latinos, is the only place in the
nation where the majority of male Latinos report contracting AIDS
through drug use.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, for Latinos seeking kinship in the dominant
Massachusetts gay community, the picture is not much better, says
Orlando del Valle, former director of the Latino Health Institute.
</P>
<P>
   Says del Valle, ``Gay culture in Boston means white,
middle-class gay culture. At best, Latinos and other minorities
feel they are seen as cute or exotic. At worst, they are seen as
less than, and inferior.''
</P>
<P>
   Amaro, a lesbian, says, ``The mainstream gay culture is not
immune to the same racism and prejudice that exists in the straight
world.''
</P>
<P>
   Too often, gay and lesbian Latinos straddle two worlds, fully
accepted by neither.
</P>
<P>
   Suicide rates among gay and lesbian Latino youth are the highest
in the state, Medrano says. According to a 1995 youth risk behavior
study, Hispanic high school girls attempted suicide at twice the
rate of Anglo or African-American girls, with the causes often
linked to rigid gender roles. In gay and lesbian youth, these
issues are amplified and augmented by the inability to find a
comfortable identity.
</P>
<P>
   When Pifferrer came out, he says, he felt he had to identify as
white to fit in. This is not an atypical reaction, says Lourdes
Rodriguez, a local psychotherapist. ``You hear it all the time,''
she says. ``Many of us joke that `I am out in English, but not in
Spanish.' But it's not really a joke.''
</P>
<P>
   Boston has no pure social organizations for gay or lesbian
Latinos. Grupo Antorcha, the only such club, dissolved within three
years of its conception in 1987, around nationality conflicts among
the Latino ethnic groups. Now, the only places Latino homosexuals
can go to talk about their shared experiences or struggles are gay
Latin nights at the nightclubs Chaps (Thursdays) and Buzz
(Fridays), or organizations centered around AIDS outreach work.
</P>
<P>
   According to Leo Negron-Cruz, founder of Worcester's Gay and
Lesbian Latino Organization, this sends the wrong message. ``It's
telling Latinos that it's only OK to be out when alcohol, drugs, or
disease are involved,'' he says. ``Given what we have to go through
in our own communities, that's really sad.''
</P>
<P>
   Lourdes Rodriguez, 50, of Boston did not come out as a lesbian
until she was 29 years old, one month after arriving in Boston from
Puerto Rico, because she never had a name for what she was until
then.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Cuba, Rodriguez was raised in Puerto Rico by strict
Catholic parents in a neighborhood where, she says, everyone knew
everyone else's business, and roles for women were rigidly and
clearly defined: You were a good girl, or you were a bad girl.
Period.
</P>
<P>
   ``If your choices are either you are the virgin or you are the
whore, then there's really little room left to be a lesbian,'' says
Rodriguez, a psychotherapist. ``I knew no lesbians growing up. You
never heard about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Again and again, Latino homosexuals in Massachusetts said in
interviews that the homophobia they face is directly linked to
narrow traditional Latino gender roles. The rules surrounding
gender roles in traditional Latino cultures are strict and
unwavering, says Rodriguez.

   ``Machismo and misogyny play a fascinating role in Latino
homophobia,'' says Matthew Florence, the director of Men of Color
Against AIDS in Boston. ``Gay men are hated or mocked not because
they choose to love other men. Rather, it is simply because they
have voluntarily given up the power that goes along with being a
man, and have by choice relegated themselves to the subservient
role of woman.'' Says del Valle, ``Gay men are seen as choosing to
be women. And if women are slaves, why would anyone in their right
mind choose to be one?''
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole notion of identifying yourself as a gay individual
is very, very American,'' says Pifferrer, who does diversity
consulting in Boston. ``What we think of as gay culture is
American. You don't find that in Latin America, unless it's
imported.''
</P>
<P>
   Negron-Cruz, who grew up in Puerto Rico but has been in
Massachusetts for 14 years, says he has met numerous men who ``are
married or have a girlfriend and think that if they have oral or
anal sex with a very effeminate man, and they are the active
partner, then they are not gay at all because to them that man is a
woman.''
</P>
<P>
   ``For many Latino men it is perfectly reasonable to have sex
with men and still be straight,'' says Pifferrer. ``It's called
denial here, but it's much more complex than that.''
</P>
<P>
   Lesbianism remains invisible in traditional Latino cultures.
Within the confines of traditional Latino gender identities,
women's sexuality does not exist, says Amaro.
</P>
<P>
   ``Women's sexuality is invisible in our community. It is seen as
unimportant and nonthreatening,'' says Amaro. ``Motherhood is
totally desexualized. In traditional cultures, women are not
supposed to be sexual. The fact that lesbians are not even
discussed is a symptom of our desexualization of Latina women.''
</P>
<P>
   When lesbianism is discussed, the woman is often seen as a
victim of some trauma that ``made her that way,'' says Rodriguez.
Often, the family or church intervenes to ``fix'' her, as in the
case of Rivera, whose mother insisted her daughter must have been
``corrupted'' somehow. After all, she had dated men before, and
even had a daughter. ``My gay cousin, meanwhile, was accepted as
having been born that way,'' Rivera says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Growing up, we always knew about a gay man somewhere in the
community,'' says Rodriguez. ``The extreme guys, the one on the
street who wore lipstick, or someone's crazy uncle. But you never,
ever heard about lesbians.''
</P>
<P>
   The ironic flip side to the cultural obstacles faced by many gay
and lesbian Latinos is that once they do come out to their families
and communities, if they are accepted, they are more often than not
totally accepted. This comes thanks in part to the Latino cultural
norms of ``familismo,'' ``respeto,'' ``dignidad,'' which, according
to Lina Castellanos, project director for Casey Mental Health
Initiatives in Miami, emphasize supportive behavior toward family
members, respect for others (especially elders), and ``the innate
worth and integrity of all people.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an all-or-nothing situation for most of us,'' says
Jarrett Barrios, a Cambridge lawyer who is gay and is running for a
State House seat. ``If they accept you, they totally accept you. If
they don't, you lose everything. Everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Often this means that, as in Rivera's case, the theme of
homosexuality will not be openly discussed in the family or the
community, even though it is implicitly understood.
</P>
<P>
   There are even Latino celebrities who defy gender stereotypes
and may be homosexual, but continue to be adored because they don't
admit any such thing. Walter Mercado, a famous television psychic,
appears on Univision in flowing robes, with heavy makeup and
painted fingernails, seated on a throne. Albita, a popular Cuban
singer in Miami, flaunts her androgynous style, and has become an
icon in the gay and lesbian community nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a very interesting dynamic in Latino families,'' says
Barrios. ``On the one hand, they may say they are horrified, that
gayness is a taboo. But on the other hand, they can almost always
overcome it by pretending.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I tell my Anglo friends that I bet there is more rejection of
gay kids in their families than there is in ours, even though we
are more openly homophobic,'' says Rodriguez. ``That's because
there is unconditional acceptance in many Latino families, as long
as you never name your homosexuality. My partner comes to Christmas
dinner, my parents come to my house and see that we share a bed.
They love her like a daughter, as long as we don't say what is
obvious, because then they'd have to make a choice.''
</P>
<P>
   Even as local Latino communities struggle with issues of
homosexuality, there are signs in the United States that Latino
society on the whole is heading _ albeit slowly _ toward a more
tolerant view of gays and lesbians.
</P>
<P>
   Cristina Saralegui, the popular Miami-based Univision talk show
host, has said that educating Latinos to accept homosexuals is a
priority. Her show is seen in 100 million homes worldwide. She has
been given awards by gay and lesbian organizations and by the
United Nations for her work involving homosexuality and AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   Actor John Leguizamo, whose one-man Broadway show ``Freak'' has
garnered rave reviews, makes sympathetic homosexual characters part
of his performances, in honor of an uncle he says introduced him to
theater.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez, the Boston psychotherapist, says she would not have
done an interview with a newspaper 10 years ago for fear of losing
clients. ``But now, I feel safer,'' she says. ``In a strange, sad
way, the AIDS epidemic has made us face the fact that a lot of the
wonderful people we knew, a lot of our community leaders, were
gay.''
</P>
<P>
   Two such leaders, Jorge Hernandez and Mauricio Gaston, died of
AIDS, which both said they contracted through gay sex. Both men had
presented themselves to the community as straight, until their
illnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez was the founder of the Villa Victoria housing
development in the South End, and the performance space there is
named after him. At the University of Massachusetts in Boston, the
Latino studies department is named after Gaston, its founder.
</P>
<P>
   The suffering of these community leaders has deeply affected
many leaders in the local community.
</P>
<P>
   When Alex Rodriguez, the former chairman for the Massachusetts
Commission Against Discrimination, announced his candidacy for
Congress, he did so at the Jorge Hernandez Cultural Center.
Rodriguez is straight, but said he chose the space as his launching
pad in part to emphasize the need for diversity and tolerance among
all people, Latinos included, and as a tribute to his friend.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a very personal statement for me,'' Rodriguez said in a
phone interview. ``Those of us who knew Jorge knew how much he
suffered under the weight he carried of living in the closet. ...
</P>
<P>
   ``Secrets are the most disturbing things to carry. You've got to
be out, you've got to be who you are. The fact that we have members
who stand proudly and gay enriches our community. I encourage every
Latino who is gay to come out and be who you are. You're carrying a
burden you don't need to carry.''

DISHONEST RHETORIC FROM A WOULD-BE PRESIDENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF JACOBY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   One of the least-remarked points about Al Gore is his mean
mouth. It is often obscured by his sanctimonious manner, which is
usually misdescribed as ``wooden.'' But the speaking style of the
man who would be the nation's 43rd president is not wooden at all;
it is condescending. Al Gore knows better than you do, so pay
attention while he talks down to you.
</P>
<P>
   Occasionally Gore's smug self-righteousness goes too far. At the
1996 Democratic Convention, he described his sister's death from
cancer 12 years earlier. Her ``nearly unbearable pain,'' he said,
turned him into an enemy of the tobacco industry, and at her very
deathbed he vowed: ``Until I draw my last breath, I will pour my
heart and soul into the cause of protecting our children from the
dangers of smoking.''
</P>
<P>
   But then it turned out that Gore had accepted money from tobacco
companies for years after the death of his sister. Reporters
revealed that in 1988, he had boasted in North Carolina about being
a tobacco farmer himself. As for that dramatic deathbed scene, it
was hard to see when he could have found time to squeeze it in: On
the day his sister died, records showed, he was busy talking
politics with a reporter from UPI and addressing the Kiwanis Club
in Knoxville. Today that convention speech, far from demonstrating
the depths of Gore's compassion and conviction, has come to be seen
as manipulative and dishonest.
</P>
<P>
   But reporters don't usually focus such close scrutiny on what
Gore says, or on the incivility with which he often says it. They
should.
</P>
<P>
   It was Gore who characterized Republicans in 1994 as wanting
``to create as much ... discord and hatefulness as they possibly
can.'' It was Gore, many liberals would be shocked to learn, who
first injected the Willie Horton episode into the 1988 presidential
race. It was Gore who likened George Bush's failure to save Kurdish
refugees in Iraq after the Gulf War to Stalin's decision ``to give
the Nazis just enough time to finish butchering the Polish
resistance.''
</P>
<P>
   The vice president routinely uncorks this kind of stuff _ ad
hominem attacks, low blows, gross insults. He gets away with it in
part because he has many admirers in the media who share his views,
in part because he has skillfully ``spun'' himself to voters as a
sober policy moderate. Such is the power of PR.
</P>
<P>
   But while Gore's image may be illusory, the harm caused by his
words can be very real indeed.
</P>
<P>
   In Atlanta last week, Gore addressed the NAACP annual
convention. Most of what he said was boilerplate (``the most
diverse administration in history ... the glass ceiling still has
not been shattered''). Much was patronizing (``we have named
African-Americans as secretary of energy, secretary of agrigulture,
secretary of commerce, secretary of veterans affairs.'') And some
was vicious.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've heard the critics of affirmative action,'' Gore
declaimed. ``I've heard those who say we have a color-blind
society. They use their color blind the way duck hunters use a duck
blind _ they hide behind it and hope the ducks won't notice.''
</P>
<P>
   That is a piece of ugliness worth parsing.
</P>
<P>
   To begin with, there isn't a single serious critic of
affirmative action who would claim that American society is
color-blind. What many of them do claim is that American law ought
to be color-blind, and that affirmative action _ with its racial
quotas, preferences, and plus-factors _ is doing more harm than
good.
</P>
<P>
   The critics of affirmative action believe with Justice John
Harlan, who dissented from the notorious opinion in Plessy v.
Ferguson, that ``our Constitution is color-blind.'' They dream with
Dr. King of a society in which individuals are judged not ``by the
color of their skin but by the content of their character.'' The
principle that the law has no business making distinctions on
racial grounds is exactly the principle that drove the civil rights
pioneers. It was for strict colorblind justice that Thurgood
Marshall and the NAACP Legal Defense Fund battled 50 years ago.
``Classifications and distinctions based on race or color,'' they
argued in a 1947 Supreme Court brief, ``have no moral or legal
validity in our society.''
</P>
<P>
   But Gore now tells the NAACP that to insist on that principle
today is to use ``color blind the way duck hunters use a duck
blind.'' Hunters use a duck blind to kill ducks. What can Gore be
saying? That affirmative action's critics want to kill _ blacks?
Does he really mean to imply something so foul?
</P>
<P>
   It is precisely what he means to imply. The implication leaps
from his text. One paragraph after denouncing those ``who now call
for the end of policies to promote equal opportunity'' _ his
euphemism for racial preferences _ Gore demands to know their
reaction to ``that heinous crime'' in Jasper, Texas. And to a 1997
crime in Virginia, where a black man ``was doused with gasoline,
burned alive, and decapitated by two white men.'' And to a crime in
Lawrence, Mass., where an interracial couple was attacked by thugs
with baseball bats.
</P>
<P>
   In the World According To Gore, opponents of affirmative action
are no better than a lynching party. He has no interest in
thoughtful debate _ as many who have tried to debate with him have
learned. They're against racial preferences? Then they must be for
racism. End of discussion.
</P>
<P>
   Does Gore actually believe such rubbish? Who knows? What matters
is that he is willing to say it _ to inject, for political gain,
the worst kind of racial poison into the national bloodstream. That
is vileness of a very low order. Imagine anyone so sleazy becoming
president.

WHEN FUNERALS LOOM, CHOICES GIVE KIDS A SENSE OF CONTROL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BARBARA F. MELTZ  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Lexi Brawer's grandpa died recently, &UR;  &LR; her parents couldn't
decide if she should go to the funeral. Lexi had just turned 7. Her
father, Jeff, thought she was too young; her mother, Marcie, wasn't
so sure. ``I worried she'd feel left out of the family if she
wasn't included,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   In the midst of grief, especially when a death is sudden, it's
not unusual for parents to react as this Brookline father did,
instinctively wanting to shield young children from adult mourning.
</P>
<P>
   But what about their mourning?
</P>
<P>
   Although children's grief looks different from ours because it
can come and go with seemingly no rhyme or reason, children of all
ages, like adults, need to acknowledge the reality of the death,
share the pain and loss with others, and remember the person who
has died. Keeping them from a funeral inhibits all that from
happening, according to children's grief specialists.
</P>
<P>
   The consensus among professionals today is that even a
3-year-old can go to a loved one's funeral.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a child is old enough to go to church services, that's old
enough to go to a funeral,'' says Rabbi Earl Grollman, a
bereavement specialist and chairman of the National Center of Death
Education at Mount Ida College in Newton, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, studies shows that children who have the hardest time
after a death are those who either aren't allowed to go to the
funeral or are forced to go, says researcher Donna Schuurman,
director of the Dougy Center of Portland, Ore., a support program
for grieving children.
</P>
<P>
   Children who cope best feel they have choices. ``It gives them a
sense of control at a time when everything feels so out of
control,'' says psychologist Alan Wolfelt, who also specializes in
children's bereavement.
</P>
<P>
   There are more choices to offer than we may realize. Does she
want to write or read something for the service? Does he want to
put something in the casket? What about help choose the casket?
Even a child as young as 4 can help with that, according to
Schuurman. The idea may feel jarring to us, but it makes good
developmental sense. ``It provides a sense of control and
involvement and closure,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   That's because a child copes better when he can see and touch
and be part of reality. ``Otherwise,'' says Wolfelt, what he
imagines can be far worse than the truth.'' Director of the Center
for Loss and Life Transition in Fort Collins, Colo., he is author
of ``Healing the Bereaved Child'' (Companion Press).
</P>
<P>
   Offering a choice is not a matter of simply asking, ``Do you
want to ...'' however. Any child who has never been to a funeral,
including 8 to 12- year olds who may have read or heard about them,
needs considerable advance preparation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Keep it simple _ `It's a ceremony to remember the person who
died' _ but anticipate how concrete children are in their thinking,
even older children,'' says grief specialist Steve Woods of the
Caring Place in Pittsburgh. For instance:
</P>
<P>
   _Even though you say Grandpa is dead, a child under 6 still
thinks death is reversible. Tell him, ``His body stopped working.
It doesn't eat or talk or breathe anymore.'' Be prepared to repeat
yourself.
</P>
<P>
   _If you talk about ``the body,'' kids typically imagine it
headless. That alone could be the reason she doesn't want to go to
the funeral. Tell her, ``Daddy's whole body is in the casket, and
it looks like it always did _ head, arms, legs, everything.''
</P>
<P>
   _If you believe Daddy goes to heaven, it's his soul that goes
there; the body is in the ground. (Stay away from using the word
``spirit''; that conjures up ghosts.)
</P>
<P>
   Explain also why we have funerals. ``Tell him one way we
remember a person is to tell stories about him, including happy
ones,'' says Wolfelt; that anticipates confusion he may have from
being at the funeral home and seeing people laughing. Describe also
who will be there: ```Lots of people we don't know will come
because they knew Grandpa and cared about him, too.' That will make
him feel good,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Once you have have conversations like this, you can pose ``do
you want to ...'' questions, with one other caveat, says Schuurman:
``Encourage, don't force.'' For instance, ```I'd like you to be
with us, but if you don't want to, it's OK.''' Most children want
to go once they realize the whole family is going.
</P>
<P>
   A young child who doesn't want to go probably has unanswered
questions, says Grollman. He urges parents not to shame her by
saying things like, ``Didn't you love Grandma?'' but to be
respectful: ``OK. Can you tell me why?'' It will often be something
simple _ ``Who will I sit next to?'' _ or concrete: ``How do they
put her in the ground?'' Many young children are unable to
verbalize their worry, so try to do it for them even if you're
repeating yourself: ``Some kids worry the body doesn't have a head.
You know it does, right?''
</P>
<P>
   If a child 8 or older doesn't want to go, it's likely an
egocentric concern. Probe deeper: ``Are you worried about your math
test? Do you think he'd give you a makeup?''
</P>
<P>
   If he still doesn't want to go, Schuurman's advice is to back
off. Woods would back off only if a child exhibits extreme anxiety.
Otherwise, he would say, ``This is something we do as a family.''
Wolfelt falls somewhere in between: ``I'd give more than a choice
but without forcing: `We really want you to come. Can you think
about it more?'''
</P>
<P>
   Wolfelt is big on finding ways to involve children in funeral
rituals. A strategy he likes is to ask them to use descriptive
phases to make an acrostic of a grandparent's name. His favorite
comes from Sarah, 6, whose grandmother's name was Tootsie. Her
acrostic began with, ``T, tells stories,'' and ended with, ``E,
eats ribs.'' During the wake, she proudly displayed it next to the
casket.
</P>
<P>
   And what about the burial? ``Children should go,'' says
Grollman. ``It's the best visual aid in the world. Two weeks later,
when the preschooler asks, `When is Daddy coming back,' you can
say: `Remember how his body was in that special box? And we watched
them put the box in the ground?''' Grollman is author of ``Talking
About Death: A Dialogue Between Parent and Child'' (Beacon Press).
</P>
<P>
   Whether it's at the visitation, funeral, burial, or a mourning
period afterward, children will say and do things that surprise
you. Like play tag at the funeral home, peer into the casket, or
examine the gravesite for bugs. ``Don't reprimand,'' says Wolfelt.
``No question is appropriate. Children do not have an innate fear
of death. That's a learned response.''
</P>
<P>
   If a 5 year old peers into a half-lidded casket, for instance,
it's to make sure the legs weren't cut off. It's natural curiosity,
not ghoulishness, that prompts a 7 year old to ask, ``Is his blood
still in him? (Answer: ``After a person dies, there's something
called embalming that gets the body ready for burial. One thing it
does is take the blood out.'')
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, it is the open casket that typically makes
parents unsure about a child's attendance. Wolfert says seeing the
body can actually help a child and in families where it is not part
of the ritual, he tells parents not to refuse a child who asks to
see it and to offer it as a choice: ``Since you helped me pick the
dress Mommy's body is going to be buried in, would you like to see
how she looks?''
</P>
<P>
   Lexi Brawer, who did go to her grandfather's funeral, sat on her
Mom's lap for most of the service. ``The only time she stepped away
from me was at the burial,'' says Marcie. ``When they lowered the
casket, she wanted to see where it was going, and how deep it was,
and why they were putting dirt on it.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, while they were driving her older sister, Leigh, to camp,
there was a moment of closure that even Hollywood couldn't have
scripted better. Looking out the car window, Leigh spotted a
rainbow.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's beaming Grandpa up!'' exclaimed Lexi.

 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _Don't wait until a death to discuss funerals. Look for
conversation openers, read a book, visit a cemetery.
</P>
<P>
   _It should be a child's choice to touch or kiss the body. Tell
her in advance it will be cold.
</P>
<P>
   _If you expect to be overcome with grief or too distracted to
answer questions, assign some other loving adult to be with your
child, even though you may also be at his side.
</P>
<P>
   _When explaining cremation, the body isn't ``burned.'' It's
``put in a room with lots of heat until it turns to ashes.''
</P>
<P>
   _Expect clergy and the funeral home director to include your
children in conversations and/or to answer questions.
</P>
<P>
   _Explain that flowers, food, and contributions are symbols of
love for the person who has died and for your family.
</P>
<P>
   _It's OK to cry or even sob in front of your child as long she
sees you are able to gain control and be yourself again.
</P>
<P>
   _After a burial, a young child may wonder when you are going to
dig Grandpa up. It's just that kids are used to burying things and
digging them back up. A simple answer will do: ``Once a person's
body is buried, that's where it stays.''

PROPER WAY TO SHINGLE OVER CLAPBOARDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER HOTTON  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. When new shingles are applied over clapboards, is it
necessary to insert an upside-down shingle on each clapboard so the
surface will be even? How much should the new shingles be exposed?
The installer is suggesting up to 8 inches.
</P>
<P>
   ALICE SULLIVAN, South Boston
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. No, certainly not in each clapboard space; you'd use twice as
many shingles as necessary. However, it would be a good idea to
insert upside-down shingles or an upside-down clapboard on the
bottom row. This would give the bottom row a slight flair, which
you need for a drip edge; the water will drip off the slightly
flaired edge instead of percolating under the bottom edge.
</P>
<P>
   As for exposure, if you are using red cedar shingles, 7 inches
is good, 6 inches is better. There should be little warping or
curling at these exposures. I think 8 inches is too much. Of
course, the smaller the exposure, the more shingles you will use.
</P>
<P>
   No matter how much you expose the shingles they should go over
the old clapboards very easily. Just be carerful nailing the
shingles; if you nail into a gap under a clapboard, you want to be
sure you don't nail too hard; if you do, the shingle will bend
outward, and it will stay bent until you release the nail and
renail more carefully.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I had a leak between my chimney and roof and I was told I
need new flashing; the contractor said he would install it for
$300. Is that reasonable?
</P>
<P>
   ELEANOR KRUCHAS, Norwood, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. It is reasonable, especially if it works. Flashing is the
weakest point of a roof, and putting flashing properly around a
chimney takes a lot of know-how and careful work.
</P>
<P>
   Put simply, metal flashing around a chimney is set against the
chimney wall and the roof, and then a second set of flashing,
called counter flashing, is set over the original flashing and
mortared right into the brick for a water-tight repair. This, as I
said, is a simple description. But done correctly, and every roofer
knows how, it will last longer than the roof.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I used masking tape on a veneered floating floor; I got most
of the tape off but a lot of the glue stuck. How can I remove it
from the finished floor without ruining the floor?
</P>
<P>
   JEAN BIRNBAUM, Chestnut Hill, mass.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. There are a million, it seems, solvents for adhesives of all
kinds, and the handyman has suggested them many times. Here are
several that might work, but I think your best bet is to use oil,
partly because the solvent is in your house already, and partly
because it is usually effective. Any kind of oil, including cooking
oil will do. Apply it liberally, and let it sit for 15 minutes to
an hour to do its work. Then scrape with a wood scraper if
necessary (the wood will not scratch the floor), but just as often
it will come off by rubbing with a coarse cloth.
</P>
<P>
   Other solvents to try are lighter fluid or charchol lighter
fluids, De-Solv-It, Klean-Strip Adhesive Remover, Dow Bug &AMP; Tar
remover, vinegar, rubbing alcohol, and mechanic's waterless hand
soap _ the pink or yellow gel that comes in a large can. All are
sold in hardware stores, which may have others that are as good or
better.
</P>
<P>
   Finally Goof-Off, a silly name for a material that removes latex
paint and other latex-based materials without harming the finish
underneath.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Last fall I put down a flagstone patio with mortar between
the stones. It looked good with dark gray mortar. Last spring some
of the mortar cracked and I had to chip it out and put in new
mortar, but it is much lighter than the original. How can I get the
new mortar to look like the old?
</P>
<P>
   FRED MAFRICI, Braintree, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Wait a while; it will turn dark before long. If you want to
speed up the darkening, paint the mortar with a dark gray
semitransparent stain, the kind you would use on shingles or
clapboards. That sounds weird, but if you have ever spilled
semitransparent stain on concrete, you know it seems to last
forever. The same will happen with the stain on the mortar.
</P>
<P>
   If you laid the flagstones on sand or stone dust, the mortar
will continue to break up as the stones move up and down with frost
heaving. It will be a constant battle. To avoid this continuous
chipping out of broken mortar and filling in with new, chip it all
out and fill the joints with stone dust. It will pack down very
nicely and will drain water well, but it won't break up. And it
will be a dark gray color.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I have some loose tiles in a shower floor. They are intact,
but I can feel them loose when I shower. How can I reglue them?
</P>
<P>
   G.N., Boston
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Pick up the tiles, scrape off any grout from their edges and
also scrape off any adhesive or mortar on their backs, and on the
floor where the tiles were. Reglue the tiles with Phenoseal, a
phenolic vinyl adhesive caulk which works wonderfully, or thin-set
mortar, which works equally well. Regrout the joints and you're in
buisness.
</P>
<P>

IN A TREEHOUSE, LIFE JUST DOESN'T GET ANY BETTER

<TEXT>
<P>
   Stephanie Schuller and her little sister Kimberly have the best
of two worlds. They have two houses. Not bad for an 8-year-old and
a 4-year-old.
</P>
<P>
   Well, one of the houses is a treehouse, and it's in the back
yard of the big house, owned by Steve Schuller and Ellen Glew,
their parents. But it's still a house, with a roof, carpet, windows
with funky shutters, and window boxes with real flowers.
</P>
<P>
   Ellen Glew had the idea that all little girls should have a
treehouse, and commissioned Schuller to go to work. In fact,
Schuller said, ``She pestered me into building the treehouse.'' But
he took it on with enthusiam and a certain flair.
</P>
<P>
   A new structure was something new for Schuller, who with his
wife and the girls live in an 18th-century house in North Reading,
Mass. The parents also operate the Restoration and Renovation Show,
an international trade show with emphasis on, well, restoration and
renovation, making sure grand old houses are fixed up properly and
with the right materials. The show is held all over the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big issue in building a treehouse is finding the right
tree,'' said Schuller, which he did, halfway down his back yard:
perfectly spreading branches for holding the frame, and not too
high up. Six feet up, to be specific. Schuller used no plans, and
by salvaging some of the wood and recycling others, spent a grand
total of $30, adding that, if he can do it, anyone can.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, there was another tree a little further down the yard,
where some boys had built a treehouse long ago, but it was 20 feet
high. The house is gone, and there is no sign of anyone having
fallen out of it, but even so, 20 feet is just too high, Schuller
decided.
</P>
<P>
   Schuller set up 2 x 8 joists left over from a project, between
the branches rather than on them. That way he could make the floor
a little bigger, not needing to cut anything to fit on top of the
branches. This arrangement is kind of nice, because it gives the
impression that the tree is gathering the house to its bosom.
</P>
<P>
   Schuller set the joists with long deck nails, but they were not
long enough, nor strong enough, because they sheared off quickly
with the movement of the tree. While the floor of the house is only
about six feet off ground, and the trunk and branches are huge,
there was still enough movement to scuttle the deck screws.
</P>
<P>
   So Schuller replaced them with 12 eight-inch lag screws a full
5/16-inch in diameter. With this added strength, Schuller is still
keeping a sharp eye on them, ``just in case.'' Said he, ``The house
dropped only a few inches when the screws sheered, but that was
more than enough for me to replace them.''
</P>
<P>
   That done, Schuller built roof and sides with wood salvaged from
a large packing crate left by one of the exhibitors in last
spring's show.
</P>
<P>
   Asphalt roof shingles were also leftovers from another project,
Schuller said.
</P>
<P>
   Schuller built the house six feet wide and three feet deep. ``A
tidy little house,'' he thought. When Glew was invited to the
unveiling, she said, ``Is that all?'' So Schuller doubled the size.
Building the house half sized, then doubling it, is a good lesson
when you build anything: Generally, if possible, double the size of
your project or, within reason, increase it by half.
</P>
<P>
   Schuller applied a coat of new Cabot's OVT barn red stain,
matching the trim on the main house.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to floor carpeting, Schuller put in a drip edge,
gutters made of a plastic pipe split in half, and a plastic
downspout. The door spring is a bungee cord.
</P>
<P>
   The screened windows will be covered with Plexiglas for the
winter.
</P>
<P>
   Glew will do the fine arts work indoors.
</P>
<P>
   Getting in and out of the house is tricky, but not for the
girls, Schuller said. He built a rope ladder with three ropes and
five rungs, secured on the ground as well as at the door. Lubbers
can use a regular ladder if they want to, or have to.
</P>
<P>
   Schuller also built a badminton court and swing set. ``It's a
regular community for the 8-year-old set,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And over to the side is Schuller's and Glew's own private
grown-up preserve: a large vegetable garden, fed by well water.
</P>
<P>
   ``I found an old dug well in the front yard,'' he said. ``The
water was six feet down and eight feet deep.'' He bought a pump
from the Want Advertiser and couplings from a lumber store for
hooking up to a hose. He uses the well only for watering the grass
and garden, and likes the price of the water.
</P>
<P>
   If more than 10,000 gallons are used in a quarter year, it costs
$6.20 per thousand. ``My well water costs 12 cents per thousand,''
he said.

   Manny Ferrante calls the Everett Springs &AMP; Eastern Railroad the
best-kept secret in Everett, Mass., and who would disagree? The
ES&AMP;E, all 600 feet and four tiers of it, takes up pretty much
everything in Ferrante's small back yard that isn't taken up by the
swimming pool. It was founded innocently enough in a corner of the
yard a decade ago, but has since devoured everything in its path,
including the long-gone garage.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's addictive, like smoking or drugs,'' declares the
52-year-old Ferrante, who likes to sit in the pool and admire, say,
a locomotive hauling three cars toward a coal loader that squats on
a Manny-made ``mountain'' some 15 feet above the ground. ``It's so
hard to stay away from it.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a small world, this garden railroading, and not just
because it's a G-scale planet where 1 inch of model train equals
about 24 inches of the real deal. The notion of running miniature
railways through back-yard flora and fauna has existed in England
for decades, but it didn't arrive here in the Colonies until some
20 years ago. Ferrante's Northeast Garden Railway Newsletter has
only about 75 subscribers, although this is considerably more than
the dozen or so that it reached when he founded it in 1992. But
despite recent growth in numbers, Garden railroaders remain a
select group that frequently gathers at ``open houses'' in each
other's back yards to swap stories of lugging crushed rock to be
used as roadbed or to croon over the latest German-made locomotive
from LGB, the Mercedes of G scale.
</P>
<P>
   Like Ferrante, most garden railroaders are incapable of stopping
what they start. Their layouts just seem to grow and grow, eating
up both real estate and time. There's land to be graded, track to
be laid, and entire villages to be built. And what about the
gardening part of garden railroading, all that Alberta spruce and
all those small-leafed euonymus bushes? ``These things are always
works in progress,'' Ferrante points out. ``Just when you figure
you can't do anything else, you find something else to do.''
</P>
<P>
   And more money to spend: Low-level G scale starter kits can be
purchased for as little as $125, but some LGB locomotives fetch as
much as $1,600. So how much has Ferrante, who runs a small
restaurant with his wife, Carol, invested in the ES&AMP;E? ``About as
much as I would have if I'd bought a Porsche instead,'' he muses.
</P>
<P>
   Spend some time with a garden railroader and you'll probably
find someone who had an electric train as a kid because he
carefully composed a letter to Santa Claus and was rewarded with a
Lionel or an American Flyer on Christmas morning. When he grew up,
he may have built a meticulous N scale (1:160) layout in the
basement or the attic. But eventually the back yard beckoned.
Hand-built trestles! Gurgling waterfalls! Tunnels carved through
real granite! Not to mention timing systems that can simultaneously
run a half-dozen trains while the railroad's president gently sips
a Bud in admiration.
</P>
<P>
   Many of these folks, of course, cannot only wax romantic about
trains but can also spew out railway minutiae with the same
obsessiveness that baseball fans dissect batting statistics. But
many are also like George Sloan of Norwell, Mass., for whom the
true pleasure of owning the pristine Meadowbrook Railroad is
derived from having built it. Three years in the making, the
Meadowbrook is an impressive 600-foot, three-line layout in which
trains actually enter and exit Sloan's finished basement through a
window that has a hinged door custom-made of Plexiglas. The
railroad is dotted with tiny Alberta spruce and features an azalea
that hangs over its picturesque pond. A miniature wedding is taking
place in the miniature town's miniature chapel, and a group of rock
climbers can be spotted on a nearby cliff. Sloan, the 62-year-old
owner of a plastics company, maintains a stable of about two dozen
engines and some 80 cars, most of which are carefully displayed in
his basement.
</P>
<P>
   But don't ask him for details about this rolling stock. He'd
rather talk about hand-building redwood trestles or painstakingly
soldering jumper wires across each rail joint. And when he
complains that maintaining the Meadowbrook takes up so much time
that he couldn't possibly expand, he's announcing a moment later
that he's seriously considering planting a Japanese garden and
running a loop of track right through it. ``I already have the
Orient Express,'' he points out enthusiastically, ``and I could
build some little Japanese houses.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides, even when you finish building a garden railroad, Mother
Nature may insist that you rebuild it. Ferrante's ES&AMP;E, for
example, was nearly wiped out five years ago when a tree fell on it
during a windstorm. Alas, most natural disasters tend to be
ongoing. In Foxborough, Mass., Ken Rich Jr. not only works hard to
contend with the English ivy that doggedly attempts to cover his
480 or so feet of track, he has also fought a series of skirmishes
with the groundhogs and rabbits that have repeatedly dined on his
flowers. About the only thing that is immune to attack by critters
is what Rich calls the ``umpteen trailer loads of rocks'' that, in
order to give his railroad ``the canyon look,'' he fetched during
construction.
</P>
<P>
   Not that Rich is complaining. How other than doing this, he asks
as he stands behind his two-family home and surveys an L-shaped
layout that features 75 feet of handmade trestles and three
tunnels, can you simulate the headaches of owning and operating
your very own railroad? ``With a little indoor layout, all you have
to do is dust it,'' explains the 51-year-old auto technician, who
ran such a railroad for several years. ``But out here, outside,
it's like ... like the real thing. You have to clear the track and
worry about weather. You have to deal with frost heaves and trim
the trees. You play engineer, oiler, maintenance man. It's just
more realistic.''
</P>
<P>
   Garden railroading would seem to be a guy thing, but that has
been changing lately. Couples such as Doug Maki and Andrea Kolb of
Lowell, Mass. are finding that, lo, it combines what were
heretofore separate hobbies into a single activity. ``I like
woodworking and electronics. Andrea likes gardening,'' declares
Maki, a 52-year-old engineer. Result: the Fort Hill Line, named for
a nearby park, a small but growing layout that features 150 feet of
track, a collection of 10 locomotives and a couple of dozen cars, a
gaggle of homemade buildings fashioned out of bird houses, a varied
assortment of a half-dozen or so plants and flowers, and a 12-foot
hawthorn tree that rises in the middle of it all.
</P>
<P>
   This particular division of labor _ Man builds, Woman plants _
was evident when Maki and Kolb attended a garden railroading
convention in Florida last year. (Yes, there are such events, as
well as a national magazine called Garden Railways.) ``At the
gardening seminars, you'd see more women,'' recalls Kolb, a
54-year-old accountant. ``And at the building seminars, you'd see
more men.''
</P>
<P>
   On Halloween, Maki and Kolb stock the Fort Hill Line with candy,
which neighborhood kids pluck from the small railroad cars. At
Christmastime, their hawthorn tree shimmers with lights. You might
think that garden railroaders, particularly those in New England,
would shut down for the winter. But you'd be wrong. After all, do
real railroads shut down?
</P>
<P>
   So what happens when it snows? Stupid question. ``You just hook
up a snowplow to the front of an engine, put four or five engines
behind it, and plow the snow off the track,'' Manny Ferrante
explains.
</P>
<P>
   Just like a real railroad.

   Pedro Martinez and Mo Vaughn have lent their names to the
formation of the Massachusetts chapter of the American Society for
the Prevention of Cruelty to Overpaid Athletes. During an emotional
fund-raiser at the Foxy Lady, outside Providence, R.I., a
spokeswoman said the organization's goal is to make fans sensitive
to the needs of all professional athletes with seven-figure annual
incomes, regardless of race, creed, or talent.

BOOM ALLOWS STATES TO GIVE BACK WHAT THEY HAVE RECEIVED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KIMBERLY BLANTON  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; BOSTON _ For state government, it doesn't get any better than
this.
</P>
<P>
   When Acting Governor Paul Cellucci this week signed a $770
million reduction in personal income taxes, Massachusetts was
hardly alone: Nineteen other states had already cut taxes this
year.
</P>
<P>
   The tax-cutting trend is the bounty of a national economic
expansion now in its eighth year. Revenues have poured into the
coffers of state governments, which ended last fiscal year flush
with a record $28.6 billion in total budget surpluses _ the most
they've had to fight over since the early 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   And quite a fight broke out on Beacon Hill. Lawmakers spent
months debating how to use the state's surplus as they jockeyed for
voters' favor in an election year. In their zeal, they voted for
record income-tax cuts and followed with a record $19.5 billion
budget that added $1 billion to programs ranging from day care to
public works projects.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was too much money around and everyone had three ways to
spend it,'' Senator Stanley C. Rosenberg (D-Amherst), chairman of
the Senate Ways and Means Committee, said Monday when the budget
passed.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Lawmakers won't be so happy if the tax cut, a permanent
reduction in the state's revenue source, forces them to cover
shortfalls in funding for essential programs that inevitably occur
when the economy slows and revenues drop.
</P>
<P>
   ``If things turn down, all of a sudden you're in trouble in
education or you're in trouble in health care,'' said
William &UR;  &LR; Pound, director of the National Conference of State
Legislatures, a Denver research group that released a new study of
state budgets around the country.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; States, on the whole, have acted responsibly, Pound said. This
is an unprecedented fourth consecutive year in which states, in
aggregate, reduced taxes. But 24 states, including Massachusetts,
also made deposits to rainy day funds established for emergencies,
according to the conference report.
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts lawmakers increased the maximum share of state
revenues that can go to the fund to 7.5 percent, from 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   It's impossible to predict what will happen years down the road
as a result of the budget decisions today.
</P>
<P>
   So what did Massachusetts taxpayers get in the fiscal 1999
windfall?
</P>
<P>
   The Legislature reduced personal income taxes in two ways: by
doubling the personal exemption for virtually all state taxpayers,
and by slashing in half the tax rate on income earned by those with
investment portfolios.
</P>
<P>
   The tax cut gives a disproportionate boost to each wealthy
individual, according to the Tax Equity Alliance for Massachusetts,
a liberal lobbying group, in an election-year package in which
candidates are courting not only Republicans but Democrats with
swelling investment portfolios.
</P>
<P>
   The Legislature slashed the rate at which investment income _
stock dividends and interest on bank accounts _ is taxed, from 12
percent to 5.95 percent. The personal income tax rate remains
unchanged, at 5.95 percent.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; According to TEAM's analysis, $492 million in reductions
because of higher personal exemptions would be spread among most of
the state's 2.9 million taxpayers. Only 770,000 _ about one-fourth
of all taxpayers _ would share in the $239 million savings from
lower taxes on investment income. That averages out to $310 each,
TEAM said. The richest 5 percent of taxpayers would get about $828
each.
</P>
<P>
   TEAM's executive director, James St. George, said a high
personal exemption makes the tax system more fair. To make the
investment tax credit fair, he said, it could be targeted to those
who need it most: ``Middle-income elderly with investment
portfolios but not a 40-year-old stock broker or mutual fund
manager.''
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts's personal tax exemption was already bigger than
those in other states. When it is doubled, taxpayers would deduct
$4,400 from their taxable income; couples filing jointly would
deduct $8,800.
</P>
<P>
   The $770 million tax cut was generous when compared with other
states. Georgia lawmakers approved a $205 million tax reduction,
increasing personal exemptions by $1,200, to $2,700. Maryland
doubled its personal exemption, to $2,400. Illinois's personal
exemption of $1,000 also doubled _ albeit in stages over three
years. Kansas raised the exemption by $250, to $2,250.
</P>
<P>
   Increases in personal exemptions are meant to win the loyalty of
the average wage earner: Since the personal exemption is subtracted
from taxable income, it most benefits those who earn less. On
average, a single individual would save $131 on his tax bill.
</P>
<P>
   David Tuerck, director of the Beacon Hill Institute at Suffolk
University, said the problem is that this measure ``exerts a drag
on the economy'' by punishing high-income individuals.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a high cost-of-living state,'' Tuerck said, adding this
``makes it less attractive to move into state and makes it tough
for Massachusetts employers to recruit workers.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers were able to slash taxes this year because of
unexpectedly high revenues in fiscal 1997. Revenues from income
taxes, the biggest single source of funds from taxpayers, were up
nearly 12 percent last year, the Department of Revenue reported.
Withholding and sales taxes increased by 9.3 percent and 3 percent,
respectively.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were increases in every major tax category,'' Revenue
Commissioner Mitchell Adams said recently.

REPUDIATED STORIES NO LONGER FADE AWAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK JURKOWITZ  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Thanks to the wonders of technology, anyone with Internet access
could have tuned in Wednesday to a live conference featuring Jack
Smith and April Oliver, the CNN producers fired for their role in
the ill-fated ``Operation Tailwind'' story alleging that the U.S.
used nerve gas on a secret 1970 mission in Laos.
</P>
<P>
   And thanks to the wonders of a churning journalistic culture in
which self-examination seems to dominate, people like Smith and
Oliver no longer need to take disgrace lying down. Wednesday in New
York -- one day after the Pentagon released its report debunking
the Tailwind story -- the two producers mounted a vigorous
counterattack. In a discussion sponsored by the prestigious Freedom
Forum think tank and moderated by former New York Times media
writer Alex Jones, Smith and Oliver defended their reporting and
portrayed their CNN bosses as nervous nellies who buckled under
Pentagon pressure.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's event coincided with the release of Smith's and
Oliver's 78-page rebuttal to the 54-page report filed by media
lawyer Floyd Abrams. Abrams was hired by CNN to conduct a Tailwind
post-mortem and the network embraced his conclusion that the story
was unsupportable. The Smith-Oliver report attacks the Abrams
investigation on a variety of fronts, charging that it was
completed too hastily, took crucial information out of context, and
unfairly attacked the crediblity of important sources.
</P>
<P>
   In stories of this nature, as in war, truth will likely remain a
casualty, given that it involves a three-decades old secret
mission. But where Smith's and Oliver's argument may resonate --
particularly among their media colleagues -- is in its portrayal of
CNN as a company without the intestinal fortitude to defend a
controversial piece of reporting.
</P>
<P>
   Oliver said that prior to the Tailwind story airing, her CNN
bosses ``were thrilled with it. They were sending me flowers.'' It
was painful to watch the ``CNN executive suite just collapsing'' in
the face of the anti-Tailwind backlash said Smith, adding that
``CNN management made a leap after the Abrams report...to the new
standard of proof (of accuracy) that applies in the criminal
justice system,'' but not in journalism.
</P>
<P>
   Smith also ventured that the Abrams report was rushed to
conclusion so that the CNN executives could meet an ``artificial
deadline'' -- the gathering of television critics in Pasadena
California earlier this month. CNN News Group president Tom
``Johnson, (CNN/U.S. President Rick) Kaplan and all the rest of
those guys wanted to go out there with the apology in hand,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Oliver and Smith faced some tough questioning Wednesday, but won
a strategic victory in keeping the issue alive.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would bet that this story is not going to be over now,''
said Jones as he brought Wednesday's conference to a close.
</P>
<P>
   And that's another feature of the modern media environment. In
an era of journalistic decentralization -- a time when big media is
almost as distrusted as big government or big business -- Tailwind
is sure to find a warm reception somewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Just ask Gary Webb, who authored a 1996 series for the San Jose
Mercury News called ``Dark Alliance'' alleging CIA complicity in a
Los Angeles crack cocaine epidemic that helped fund the Nicaraguan
Contras. In 1997, after the series had been savaged in the
mainstream press, Webb's editor publicly repudiated it and Webb
resigned in anger. Like Smith and Oliver, he claimed his bosses
didn't have the guts to face down critics.
</P>
<P>
   So a defiant Webb struck out on his own and wrote a book
propounding his ``Dark Alliance'' thesis. At last count, it was
number 12 on The San Francisco Chronicle's best seller list.

GUN-TOTING AMERICANS FIND HARSH REALITY IN MEXICO 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, Jan. 26)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By SUSANA HAYWARD,  
 PHILIP TRUE and JODI BIZER  
 c.1998 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MATAMOROS, Mexico _ In prisons across Mexico, more than 80
Americans are serving time for carrying a gun or possessing
ammunition, practically God-given rights in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Both are a crime in Mexico, where gun-control laws are strict
and unforgiving, even if weapons or bullets are unintentionally
taken across the border.
</P>
<P>
   The case of Neil Johnson, a top manager for a San Antonio
grocery company, exemplifies the trouble some gun-carrying
travelers have encountered at the border.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, 57, spent three months in a Nuevo Laredo prison last
year, initially charged with transporting military weapons after
Mexican Customs officials found a .22-caliber rifle and a deer
rifle in his car.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was probably the most frustrating experience in my life.
I've never been in jail,'' Johnson said. ``The first week I was
there I was scared to death.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson was one of more than a dozen Americans interviewed for
this story who had served time for breaking Mexico's tough gun
laws.
</P>
<P>
   It is illegal to carry weapons and bullets into Mexico without a
permit. Permits are difficult to get and are mostly issued for
hunting.
</P>
<P>
   The violation for weapon offenses is so serious that bond is
automatically denied. Charges normally carry a mandatory five-year
sentence, but that can soar to as high as 30 years in prison if the
firearms are considered military style _ any weapon greater than
.38-caliber.
</P>
<P>
   There are 363 Americans jailed in Mexico, 83 of them for
firearms charges, according to the U.S. Embassy in Mexico City. The
majority of the others are imprisoned for drug-related offenses,
followed by theft and assault.
</P>
<P>
   Not even American law enforcement officers are exempt from
Mexico's weapons laws.
</P>
<P>
   Leonel Herrera, a deputy sheriff in Jim Hogg County, Texas, had
a box of .44-Magnum bullets in his car when he crossed the border.
He was caught and spent 80 days in Nuevo Laredo's La Loma state
prison before being released May 27.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just forgot,'' said Herrera, 58. ``People down here have to
be very careful. It's ridiculous. You hire a Mexican lawyer to
represent you, and they charge you thousands of dollars and there's
no guarantee you can get out.''
</P>
<P>
   Ricardo Esteban Gonzalez, who works in the Iowa beef industry,
wonders when he will get out.
</P>
<P>
   He has been in the Santa Adelaida state prison in Matamoros
since May 10, when he drove across the border with two 9mm pistols
he uses for target practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never imagined this is where I'd end up,'' Gonzalez, a
burly, shy and homesick 26-year-old, said as he fought back tears.
``I've never been in prison, never done anything bad.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. citizens, whose right to bear arms is written into the
Constitution, often claim ignorance about the strict anti-gun laws
south of the border.
</P>
<P>
   ``Americans are not aware that even a small firearm, like a .22,
is considered a threat in this country,'' said David Stewart, U.S.
deputy consul general in Ciudad Juarez, Mexico, where two American
citizens are jailed on weapons charges. ``People are unaware just
how strict this Mexican law is.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Americans also are unaware that they are breaking U.S. law if
they take a firearm out of the country and don't register it with
the Customs Service.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico maintains gun control is essential to national security.
</P>
<P>
   With a rebel standoff in Chiapas, guerrillas uprising in
Guerrero and drug cartels responsible for much of the country's
violence, Mexicans say they can't be too careful because American
guns could end up in the wrong hands.
</P>
<P>
   Officials are quick to point out the gun that killed
presidential candidate Luis Donaldo Colosio in 1994 was traced to a
Texas dealer.
</P>
<P>
   But many Americans who spent time in a Mexican jail say the law
doesn't differentiate between an arms dealer and the person who
forgot the gun in his vehicle, as the majority of Americans claim,
or those who don't know about the law.
</P>
<P>
   Many also complained about an expensive legal system in which
they paid high dollars to lawyers but saw little in return. Figures
given for legal costs ranged from as low as $2,000 to as high as
$40,000.
</P>
<P>
   In one high-profile case, Tommy Bean, an auto and gun dealer,
was incarcerated March 14 at Nuevo Laredo's La Loma prison after he
attended a gun show and drove across the border in a Chevrolet
Suburban for lunch.
</P>
<P>
   A hunter, Bean, 59, had about 200 rounds of ammunition from
various calibers in plain view in the back seat. Some of the
bullets were high caliber.
</P>
<P>
   The Texan got a five-year sentence. His appeal was denied July
8.
</P>
<P>
   His family has gone through several lawyers and thousands of
dollars, to no avail.
</P>
<P>
   Bean did not want to be interviewed for this story. But his
wife, Sara Bean, spoke in a telephone interview about the pain the
situation is causing the family.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mental, the physical, the emotional anguish is unbearable.
The law is very cold,'' she said. ``They are looking at a
59-year-old man with a bum knee, a bum back, who has high blood
pressure, who is obviously not a gun smuggler.''
</P>

<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL;

<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The weapons issue grabbed the attention of Texas Gov. George W.
Bush, who raised the subject during a recent meeting of the Border
Governors Conference.
</P>
<P>
   Linda Edwards, a spokeswoman for the governor, said Bush told
his Mexican counterparts that he was ``concerned about the growing
number of innocent individuals who inadvertently brought a gun or
ammunition into Mexico from Texas and are detained.''
</P>
<P>
   ``While the governor acknowledges Mexico needs to enforce its
laws, he asked the Mexican governors to exercise some flexibility
for these innocent individuals,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Guillermo Alarcon, a noted Nuevo Laredo lawyer hired by the Bean
family, said Mexican law makes no exceptions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The law is very impersonal. It's for everybody. In the case of
Mr. Bean, who had no intention to commit a crime, but he did, the
law makes no distinction between whether you wanted to (break the
law) or not,'' Alarcon said. ``You have to prove really well that
there was no intention.''
</P>
<P>
   Alarcon said the answer lies in better informing the public
about Mexican law.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Antonio Chacon, assistant director of Customs in Nuevo
Laredo, rolls his eyes when told that many people forget they have
weapons in the car.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they forget, how come we find guns hidden in the glove
compartment, inside tires, inside the air conditioning, under the
seat?'' he said.

   WASHINGTON _ With black teenagers smoking in record numbers,

   Rep. Eva Clayton, D-N.C., says she is ``in a difficult

   MEXICO CITY _ For millions of Americans, Mexico is a country no
more distant than the width of a river, or even a fence. A quick
trip to a restaurant or bar for a meal or a few rounds of
margaritas.
</P>
<P>
   But the ease of crossing ``al otro lado,'' the other side, masks
just how great a trip it really is, said Jorge Bustamante,
president of the Tijuana-based Colegio de la Frontera Norte.
</P>
<P>
   The 2,000-mile, U.S.-Mexico border is the world's longest, most
porous interface between the First and Third Worlds. It is also the
place where 500 years of Roman Catholic Spanish heritage runs up
against northern Europe and the Protestant Reformation, Bustamante
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``People in the United States frequently ignore these vast
differences,'' he said. ``We in Tijuana have more in common with
people in Buenos Aires than those in San Diego.''
</P>
<P>
   American tourists fail to educate themselves about the customs
and laws in Mexico, said Jose Hinojosa, a political scientist at
the University of Texas Pan-American at Edinburg.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Ugly American attitude surfaces in odd places,'' Hinojosa
said.
</P>
<P>
   Americans ``don't recognize that when we go to (Mexico), we are
dealing with new laws, mores and practices,'' he said. ``We think
we can do what we want.''
</P>
<P>
   Along the border, an increasing number of American motorists
have been arrested for trying to cross into Mexico with guns or
ammunition, which are illegal in Mexico without a permit.
</P>
<P>
   Most Americans say they didn't know about the Mexican law or
just forgot they had a gun or a box of ammunition in the car. The
consequences more often than not mean jail time.
</P>
<P>
   Mexican immigration authorities count more than 300 million
border crossings a year in both directions.
</P>
<P>
   While fences and border guards control the flow of people,
attitudes pass unrestricted, Bustamante said. Those attitudes often
sting.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the North American Free Trade Agreement, we have a
growing integration with our two economies. Yet at many parts of
the border, the United States has built nine-foot steel fences,''
he said. ``The conflicting image is that of Mexico as valued
trading partner and also enemy turf.''
</P>
<P>
   Mexico is the United States' third largest trading partner and
on track to be its second. More than $150 billion worth of goods
and services passes between the two countries annually, with about
half of that trade either originating in or passing through Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Yet that fact often is lost among the headlines that Mexico's
chief exports are narcotics and illegal immigrants, Bustamante
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is an ideology that Mexicans are a bunch of criminals,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is an assumption that all rules should be those of the
United States, and preferably written in English, and if Mexico
does not agree, it is because it is backward,'' he said. ``There is
a great surprise when somebody applies a law that is different from
that in the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the clearest example of arrogance occurs each spring
with the annual invasion of South Padre Island by tens of thousands
of partying American college students, said Gary Mounce, who
teaches criminal justice at the University of Texas Pan-American.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of students sun all day, then troop to the tourist
zone of Matamoros to drink all night. Drunken revelers often are
arrested for urinating on public streets, or other violations of
Mexican sensibilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kids from the United States obviously need training'' about
what is acceptable in Mexico, Mounce said. ``But then, so do
adults, who often just forget that there are rules in Mexico.''

PRISON LIFE IN MEXICO NOT ALWAYS HELL BEHIND BARS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, July 26)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By SUSANA HAYWARD  
 c.1998 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MATAMOROS, Mexico _ The bright mural outside the Santa Adelaida
state prison here tells a tale of perdition and redemption: a man
who led a criminal life filled with drugs, women and booze finds
success working, studying and praying _ in jail.
</P>
<P>
   Prisons in Mexico are officially ``Centers for Social
Readaptation.''
</P>
<P>
   Many look like cities within cities. Many are overcrowded.
</P>
<P>
   The colorful entrance to Santa Adelaida, 20 miles south of
Matamoros, reflects conditions inside.
</P>
<P>
   When the steel gates open, what emerges is a town where children
play, women cook and television sets blare. The smell of sizzling
meat drifts from corner restaurants, and a myriad of tiny grocery
stores sells everything from cold sparkling water to canned goods.
</P>
<P>
   Men work as mechanics in auto shops or carve shiny picture
frames in wood shops. Nearby, they lift weights in a gym or shoot
hoops on a playground.
</P>
<P>
   A fledgling garden sprouts carrots, onions and other produce. A
manicured baseball field thrives despite the blistering heat of
drought-stricken northern Mexico, thanks to the loving care of an
American inmate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got my little piece of apple pie here,'' boasts Louis
Stephens, 45, a Brownsville, Texas, man serving time on drug
charges.
</P>
<P>
   Santa Adelaida defies the notion that Mexican prison life is
hell on Earth. Here, prisoners are locked up only at night and
conjugal visits are almost a daily ritual.
</P>
<P>
   The prison is filled to its capacity of 1,290 inmates _ about 90
of them women. Unlike most prisons, it is not overcrowded, a reason
officials say it runs smoothly.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, the La Loma prison in Nuevo Laredo _ across the Rio
Grande from Laredo, Texas _ was built to hold about 200 inmates but
often has up to 1,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you first go in there you are put in an observation
cell,'' said Mike Hinojosa, who spent eight days at La Loma for
having 13 bullets in his car.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no ventilation, you sleep on the floor, there are no
bunks. There is no water to drink, no toilet,'' he said from his
home in Corpus Christi, Texas. ``It stunk. It smelled like human
waste and dirty, sweaty people. It made your stomach go sick ... I
was in a nightmare.''
</P>
<P>
   Both prisons house state and federal inmates, who committed
crimes ranging from homicide, assault, robbery and sale of
narcotics.
</P>
<P>
   At Santa Adelaida, women prisoners sleep in their own quarters,
but during the day they roam with men. Dating and marriage among
prisoners is not uncommon.
</P>
<P>
   Female prisoners may also have their children living with them.
</P>
<P>
   ``The American (prison) system is very good, but they don't have
the humanity _ the human contact that everybody needs. It's hard to
separate the family,'' said prison guard Jose Antonio Izquierdo
Perez.
</P>
<P>
   The good life costs money, though. The more money a prisoner
has, the better life is, and inmates have to pay for their keep.
They must supply their beds, pillows, blankets and any other
comforts.
</P>
<P>
   Food can be brought in by family, and inmates also can order
takeout, provided the restaurant delivers.
</P>
<P>
   One American prisoner who didn't want his name used has two
color television sets in his cell, which is filled with magazines
and books, a stereo and a new air-conditioning unit.
</P>
<P>
   He pays another prisoner to do his laundry and clean his cell.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't want to do my time in the United States,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Are there drugs in prison?
</P>
<P>
   ``We stay calm,'' he said, noting marijuana, cocaine and alcohol
are available for a price.
</P>
<P>
   Everything has its price.
</P>
<P>
   The poor have to work for their keep, even if it is earning
money toiling for other prisoners, washing their clothes or
cleaning rooms.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything here costs money. You pay for everything,'' said
Antonio Manchaca, a Brownsville car dealer jailed on arms-smuggling
charges. ``It's better than an American prison, but you have to
work for everything.''
</P>
<P>
   In its report on Mexican prisons, the international organization
Human Rights Watch said many are overcrowded and dilapidated, with
inadequate food and health services.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the other hand, there are positive features of Mexican
prison life,'' it said.
</P>
<P>
   ``In virtually all state prisons, prisoners exercise significant
control over their daily routines.''

PEANUT BUTTER, THAT OLD STANDBY, MAKE GOOD NUTRITIONAL SENSE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By BONNIE WALKER  
 c.1998 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ It's a kid's lunchbox favorite that might also be
the world's fastest three-ingredient recipe.
</P>
<P>
   First, assemble the components _ a fresh jar of thick, creamy
peanut butter, two hefty slices of bread and a spoonful of your
favorite jelly.
</P>
<P>
   Blanket one slice of bread with a smear of peanut butter,
followed by a generous layer of jelly and top it with the other
slice of bread. (Of course, there are those who like to spread the
peanut butter on one slice of bread and the jelly on the other,
then put them together. To each his own.)
</P>
<P>
   That's it _ the classic American peanut butter and jelly
sandwich.
</P>
<P>
   How popular is it? With school just around the corner, here is a
timely fact: The Great American Food Almanac tells us the average
American student will have consumed approximately 1,500 pounds of
peanut butter and jelly sandwiches by the time he or she graduates
from high school.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas Peanut Producers Association adds this tidbit:
Americans eat about 4 pounds of peanut butter per capita annually.
And together, we eat enough each year that, if spread, it would
cover the floor of the Grand Canyon.
</P>
<P>
   Is it a nutritious choice for your child's lunchbox or
after-school snack?
</P>
<P>
   ``Because bread is naturally low in fat and full of vitamins and
minerals, it creates a nutritious base for any sandwich,'' says
Judi Adams, a registered dietitian who heads the nonprofit Wheat
Foods Council.
</P>
<P>
   ``The peanut butter adds protein, fiber, niacin and zinc, and
jelly adds to the great taste. The combination helps provide
children with energy they need for school, sports and fun,'' Adams
says.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, peanuts have taken the rap of being a high-fat
food, however. Although peanuts are cholesterol-free, they do
contain fat _ about 14 grams per ounce. More than half of that fat,
though, is monounsaturated.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the good kind of fat,'' says Jennifer Maranowicz, a
registered, licensed dietitian with Northwest Santa Rosa
Rehabilitation Center in Texas, who adds that she considers peanut
butter a nutritional powerhouse.
</P>
<P>
   Also, she notes, a serving of peanut butter contains many of the
13 essential vitamins, including vitamin E, and minerals.
</P>
<P>
   A cautionary note to parents is in order, though, says Dr.
Stephen Holt, a gastroenterologist, internist and author who has
specialized in nutritional studies throughout his career.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think peanut butter in moderation is a useful source of
calories. ... But I'd ask parents to consider carefully the amount
of calories involved,'' emphasized Holt, who lives and works in
Fairfield, N.J. ``Childhood obesity, especially in the Southwest,
is a terrible problem and parents should understand that peanut
butter is stuffed with calories.''
</P>
<P>
   Holt suggests peanut butter, in moderation, as a special treat
for children rather than a day-to-day staple in the diet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm also a little concerned about the food-processing methods
used for peanut butter, especially the hydrogenated fats,'' he
says.
</P>
<P>
   Peanut butter does, he says, have a good protein content _ about
four grams per tablespoon.
</P>
<P>
   Peanut butter's fat content (eight grams per tablespoon) may
seem high, but is actually a better nutritional choice than some
other popular kids' foods, Maranowicz says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone thinks about peanut butter as having so much fat, but
compare it to the total amount of fat, say, in an ounce of potato
chips, which is about 10 grams total fat with a higher percentage
of saturated fat. Or American cheese, which has nine grams of fat
for one ounce.''
</P>
<P>
   To reduce the fat in a peanut butter sandwich, try some
lower-fat options, she says. Use less on the sandwich, serve it
less often or use some of the ``light'' peanut butters on the
market.
</P>
<P>
   Fiber also boosts the nutritional value of the peanut butter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kids can be diabetic, too,'' says Maranowicz. ``And peanut
butter, especially the crunchy kind, is a good source of fiber.
Fiber helps to keep blood sugar under control and reduces blood
cholesterol.''
</P>
<P>
   What about the sugar in jelly? ``Buy sugar-free jelly,'' says
Maranowicz, who recommends Smucker's sugar-free varieties.
(All-fruit brands can be high in sugar, too, so read the ingredient
list and nutrition label.)
</P>
<P>
   Other ways to pack more nutrition into this popular sandwich are
to be sure to use a whole-grain bread and use fresh fruit, such as
banana or apple slices, instead of high-sugar jellies. A little
honey would also be a good sweetener. Or skip the jelly altogether
and spoon the peanut butter into crispy celery sticks. (If kids
like raisins, Maranowicz says, sprinkle them over the stuffed
celery sticks for another kids' favorite called ``bugs on a log.'')

THE BARE FACTS ON GETTING AN INDOOR TAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CYNTHIA ROBINS  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Self tanning requires a little bit of planning
and some fairly simple steps. You cannot just slop the stuff on and
get a terrific tan. Like a painter preparing his canvas to accept
color, you've got to prepare your skin.
</P>
<P>
   And that doesn't mean a cursory go-round with some nice-smelling
hand soap and a washcloth. To get your skin receptive for all the
glories of a deep, satisfying and totally safe tanning experience,
you've got to exfoliate, or get rid of dead skin cells.
</P>
<P>
   The easiest way is to get yourself a loofa and some gentle
exfoliating gel _ Frederic Fekkai has a new Body Scrub with Shea
Butter ($27.50, order by calling toll-free 1-888-FFEKKAI) that
polishes rough, dry skin; Lancome makes Exfoliance Fraichelle
Invigorating Body Scrub and Clinique developed the refreshingly
minty-scented Body Sloughing Cream ($14.50). Use on the large areas
of the body and then concentrate on elbows, knees, ankles, wrists
and the backs of your heels where the skin is thicker.
</P>
<P>
   For an even application, start with your lowest extremities,
always. You may, however, want to skip your feet, because this
stuff wears off. Sandals, for instance, can rub tanners away and it
will look like you've got straps on your feet. If you're going to
spend a lot of time barefoot, then slather it on by all means and
reapply daily.
</P>
<P>
   Be sure to use enough tanner on your legs and thighs, making
sure that the product covers your legs smoothly. Self-tanners come
in creams, lotions, oil sprays and mousse. Since your knees crease,
you might want to put a little body lotion on them (elbows, too)
and then apply the tanner to prevent dark build-up in the natural
wrinkles.
</P>
<P>
   You can give yourself a bikini line or use tanner all over your
body. Don't put on clothing over the tanner until it is completely
dry (about a half-hour) _ and you don't want to wash the tanner off
or even exercise heavily for at least three hours, because sweat
will streak the tanners.
</P>
<P>
   The easiest thing is to sit on a towel for a while so you won't
stain anything. Some of the tanners, particularly Sun Laboratories
products (which are used at spas) or Lauder's new Go Bronze for the
face, are tinted, which helps you see where you're putting it. But
they do stain when they're wet.
</P>
<P>
   Do your chest, arms, neck and shoulders last, particularly if
you've covered your stomach and abdomen. If you bend, you can get
crease marks.
</P>
<P>
   The toughest place for a home-alone person to get is the
``boyfriend'' spot in the middle of the back. No arms are that
long. So here are a few suggestions:
</P>
<P>
   If you've got a boyfriend, a husband, son, girlfriend, daughter
or lover, wait until they are home so they can get your back for
you. If there is no one around, maybe your neighbor. Or ... a
back-scratcher with a pad of cotton doused with the stuff. Other
than that, too bad. Just don't wear anything so low-cut in the back
that your ``tan line'' will show.
</P>
<P>
   There are salons that will do a tanner application for you which
will eliminate that tricky ``boyfriend spot'' problem.
</P>
<P>
   The tricky part to applying tanner is the hands. This stuff will
stain your palms if you do not wash them with soap and water after
you are finished ``tanning.'' How to get it on our hands _ where it
belongs? Apply tanner to the backs of the hands and rub them
together. Or use a cosmetic sponge to get the tops of the fingers
coated well. You will notice, however, that your hands will fade
first because you are constantly washing them.
</P>
<P>
   To increase color intensity, plan to reapply the next day. Then
be prepared to touch it up every few days if you want to maintain
an even tan. Again, be generous and apply to clean skin. You do not
have to exfoliate your second or even third application.
</P>
<P>
   How long will it last? Say, four days. But if you use a shower
brush or washcloth, you will notice that the color will begin to
slough off naturally a bit sooner.
</P>

TV FILM IN WORKS ON YOUNG GAY'S SUICIDE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CAROL NESS  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Just as America's Christian right launches
another crusade to brand gays as sinners with a choice,
Oscar-winning actress Susan Sarandon has signed on to make a
network television movie about a tragedy that happened because of
such beliefs.
</P>
<P>
   NBC has just cut a deal with Sarandon and a trio of co-producers
to dramatize the story of Bobby Griffith, who jumped to his death
from a freeway overpass at age 20 after fighting for years to
change his sexual orientation, as his fundamentalist family and
church said he should.
</P>
<P>
   If everything goes right _ and with a TV movie that's a big if,
the producers stress _ ``Prayers for Bobby'' could be broadcast
sometime next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish it could be out right now, with all that stuff going
on,'' said Mary Griffith, Bobby Griffith's mother, a central
character in the story, referring to ads placed in three national
newspapers by 15 Christian-right groups last week calling on gays
to find Jesus and go straight.
</P>
<P>
   It was Mary Griffith who told her son over and over that he was
a sinner to be gay. And it was she who, after his suicide in 1983,
re-examined her religious beliefs, came to believe in a more loving
God, and has worked unceasingly over the past 12 years to improve
life for young gay and lesbian people.
</P>
<P>
   The story of Bobby and Mary Griffith is familiar to the 20,000
or so people who bought ``Prayers for Bobby,'' a 1995 book by
former Oakland Tribune executive editor Roy Aarons.
</P>
<P>
   Disney originally optioned Aarons' book for a movie in 1996, but
nothing came of it, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Then three young Hollywood producers _ Daniel Sladek (``Talos
the Mummy'' for Miramax is his latest movie), his production
partner Chris Taaffe, and David Permut (``Face/Off'' is his most
recent release) _ grabbed it and took it to Sarandon. For her first
venture into movie production, she'd been looking for a project to
take to NBC, according to Aarons.
</P>
<P>
   Although Aarons and others are hoping the star of ``Atlantic
City,'' ``Bull Durham'' and ``Dead Man Walking'' will decide to
play Mary Griffith in the movie, she has only committed to
producing, her agent, Martha Luttrell in Los Angeles, said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's very interested in the story and thought it was
important,'' Luttrell said. Sarandon was not available to explain
her interest, but she's known for doing work with social meaning.
</P>
<P>
   Aarons and Sladek were ecstatic that a Hollywood star of
Sarandon's stature would back the project and said that makes it
more likely it will be made.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Hollywood, it's a very controversial story because it
combines three hot issues _ religion, homosexuality and suicide,''
Aarons said. ``We knew we had to get someone with real clout behind
it to make it a viable project.''
</P>
<P>
   NBC said its policy is not to comment on projects in
development. But the Hollywood Reporter quoted the network's head
of movies, Lindy DeKoven, as saying she was ``thrilled to have the
opportunity to do a project with her.''
</P>
<P>
   Even with Sarandon on board, Aarons and Sladek cautioned that
this is just the first step in a long process, with many obstacles
along the way, among them possible opposition to the movie's
themes.
</P>
<P>
   But NBC has shown its willingness to take on hot topics,
producing ``Roe v. Wade'' and the 1995 film ``Serving in Silence:
The Margarethe Cammermeyer Story,'' which stirred things up with an
on-screen shot of two women kissing in the story of a decorated
lesbian's efforts to stay in the Army.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Aarons cautioned, ``Don't hold your breath. With
Hollywood, you never know. But this is a major step forward.''

<P>
   SCI-CLONER-PROFILE (Undated) _ Man in the News: Dr. Ryuzo
Yanagimachi, the man who cloned mice, followed advice given him by
a mentor more than 30 years ago: take the grant money and spend
three days a week doing the research you said you would do. Then
spend the other two days doing anything you want. What he wanted to
do was clone, disregarding the prevailing view among reproductive
biologists that mice would be the most difficult of all mammals to
clone. As for cloning humans, he politely but firmly declined to be
drawn in. ``If all the humans on the face of the earth were
infertile, this may be justified,'' Yanagimachi said. ``But until

it for us.'' By Gina Kolata. (1200 words)

<P>
   He is Matt Drudge. Drudge believes he's leading the charge of
people everywhere to take back the news. He calls himself a
``citizen reporter'' and has, as the hype and controversy around
him has swelled, become a cartoon figure who is both laughable and
frightening.
</P>
<P>
   And now, apparently, legit.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the news organization christening him is the Fox News
Channel, so take from that what you will. The Fox News Channel airs
``Drudge,'' which is little more than a televised version of his
Web site, ``The Drudge Report.'' And now, as Fox jumps late _ very
late _ into the newsmagazine business with ``Fox Files,'' it has
added Drudge as a ``commentator.''
</P>
<P>
   This reeks of business-as-usual for Fox News, which was started
by people who thought TV news was too liberal, which is peopled by
lots of conservatives and ``reporters'' who have worked for the
likes of ``Inside Edition.'' Fox News _ still struggling like
counterpart MSNBC to find an audience _ will try anything to be
different. It sought the youth viewer and hired Chuck D., a rap
star whose Public Enemy group helped revolutionize the hip-hop
genre. It hired Brit Hume to add credibility in established
journalistic circles. Then the channel came up with this slogan:
``We report. You decide.''
</P>
<P>
   It began airing all kinds of pompous ads meant to distance
itself from the national network news and CNN.
</P>
<P>
   In short, it said, ``We're fair, they're biased.''
</P>
<P>
   It criticized everyone else while essentially doing the same
thing _ spinning the news with shows like ``Special Report With
Brit Hume,'' ``The O'Reilly Factor'' and finally ``Drudge.''
</P>
<P>
   If this is progress, journalistically, Lord help all of us. When
the press screws up _ as CNN did with its Vietnam gas story _
everyone takes the hit. But only Fox News tries to say it won't
happen to them. But giving Matt Drudge air time only further
exposes the real truth about Fox News and its new baby, ``Fox
Files.''
</P>
<P>
   Drudge came to prominence because his rumor-filled Web site and
newsletter was dishy and entertaining and harmless until people
started treating it like fact, like this unconnected man sitting in
front of his computer was really plugged in. What Drudge was doing
was reading a lot of newspapers and on-line newspaper and wire
services and then reporting what was about to be reported.
</P>
<P>
   He repeated news. He didn't report it. As he gained in
popularity, he got anonymous tipsters. And he posted a story that
said Newsweek was going to print a major story about President
Clinton and Monica Lewinsky. When they didn't, he made headlines by
``breaking'' the story that ultimately got out.
</P>
<P>
   Drudge has been billed as ``the first star of the Internet'' _
not true; porn was the first star of the Internet _ and he has
turned this infamy into a job and higher profile. Ailes, chairman
and chief executive of the Fox News Channel, says ``Matt Drudge is
just a guy who figured it out first and got it first,'' although
Drudge has been proven wrong numerous times.
</P>
<P>
   In defense, Drudge will say, ``I've broken dozens of national
exclusives that I've written from my dirty Hollywood apartment.
It's a romantic period where many voices can be heard and may the
most interesting one win.''
</P>
<P>
   Established journalists dislike his lack of fact-checking,
rumor-mongering. That Fox News has picked him up only confirms the
worst fears of everyone.
</P>
<P>
   But Drudge is loving this. He says ``romantic'' and ``citizen
reporter'' a lot, like he's living a black and white movie. He
wears an old-school reporter's hat (it doesn't have a press card
stuck on the side because Drudge likes to be an outsider and
wouldn't consider registering for credentials).
</P>
<P>
   He has become a cartoon, a guy who has the sass of Quentin
Tarantino but not even the experience of a high school newspaper
reporter. Now he has a TV audience, like Dan Rather and company.
</P>
<P>
   Ailes was asked if he was going to give Drudge a lesson in
Journalism 101. ``Two years ago nobody in this room thought I knew
anything about it,'' he said, surly and defensive as always. And he
was right. Nobody trusts Fox. Not then. Especially not now.

`PRIVATE RYAN' A TOUR OF REALITY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GLENN WHIPP 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Tom Hanks doesn't look like an action hero. He has
never acted the part in a film, either. So the fact that he's
playing the platoon captain in Steven Spielberg's brutal new war
film, ``Saving Private Ryan,'' offers a telling clue about the kind
of movie Spielberg set out to make.
</P>
<P>
   ``Saving Private Ryan'' approaches World War II, and
specifically the Normandy Invasion, from angles that have never
been shown. Spielberg is unsparing in showing the horrors of war,
from the slaughter at Omaha Beach on D-Day to scenes of American
soldiers shooting surrendering Germans. Patriotism is on display,
but it isn't the kind of gung-ho, rah-rah spirit that radiated from
movies like John Wayne's ``Sands of Iwo Jima.'' The soldiers here
are cynical, hardened and dog tired. More than anything else, they
just want to go home.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, many of them won't.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 100 years, when people want to know what World War II was
like, this is the movie they'll watch,'' says historian Stephen E.
Ambrose, whose best-selling books ``Citizen Soldiers,'' ``Band of
Brothers'' and ``D-Day: June 6, 1944: The Climactic Battle of World
War II'' informed much of the action and small details in ``Saving
Private Ryan.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is how it happened. People are going to look at this
movie and say it couldn't be that bad. I guarantee you it was that
bad. I saw on the screen what I've been hearing from veterans for
30 years. I just never thought I'd see it on screen.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet here it is, every detail save for the smell of the
battlefield. And in the middle of it is not Schwarzenegger or
Stallone or any other beefed-up action star, but Hanks, an actor
who embodies Ambrose's concept of the ``citizen soldier,'' ordinary
Americans who left their farms and their jobs to go off to war.
Like Jimmy Stewart before him, the 43-year-old Hanks has the
essence of the everyday, underscored by a basic decency and
hard-earned nobility.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the other war movies are essentially action-adventure
movies set with World War II backdrops,'' Hanks says. ``So from
that point of view, who would view me as a captain on D-Day? It's
like, `Wait a minute. These guys are cigar-chomping,
rough-and-tumble, two-fisted guys.'
</P>
<P>
   ``And if you're going to do the mythic version of the war,
that's fine. But in reality, these were ordinary men like me. They
were haberdashers and accountants and iron workers. They were these
guys who went down and signed up on Dec. 8, 1941. And they weren't
all apple-pie, John Wayne heroes who got off the boats at Omaha
Beach and stormed the beach without any problem.''
</P>
<P>
   The film makes that painfully clear in a horrific, 24-minute
sequence that shows hundreds of American soldiers being shot,
maimed and blown to bits after coming off the boats at Omaha Beach.
The nightmarish footage is shocking and relentless and, for much of
the audience, surprising. For, while many of the Allied landings in
Normandy did catch the Germans by surprise, the stories at Omaha
and Utah beaches were altogether different. Historians estimate
that of the first 5,000 men who hit the beach at Omaha, 18
survived.
</P>
<P>
   Spielberg never hides from the carnage.
</P>
<P>
   ``The normal way to make this movie would have been to have a
long period of time where you get to know all the characters and
figure out who they are and then there's a big battle scene and
some people die and some people don't,'' Hanks says. ``Instead,
with this movie, right off the bat you're into D-Day and all hell
is busting loose and you've got to survive in five minutes. It
doesn't explain why these guys are there because it isn't necessary
to do so. It's D-Day. End of story.''
</P>
<P>
   Adds Spielberg: ``It took four weeks of filming, six days a
week, just to shoot the Omaha landing footage. But we wanted to get
it right. I cannot tell you how many veterans came up to me when we
were researching this film and said, `Please be honest about it.
Don't make another Hollywood movie about World War II. Please tell
our stories.' They didn't want any part of the movie if it was
going to be just another sanitized version of the war.''
</P>
<P>
   For that reason, we see seasick troops vomiting over the sides
of their boats before taking the beach. We see the kinetic chaos of
the battleground in scenes that seem almost straight from a
newsreel. And we see death _ not in slow-motion, not in merciful
quickness _ but full of twisted agony, with soldiers retrieving
fallen limbs and stuffing their intestines back in their stomachs,
writhing bodies being trampled by the next wave who are hoping to
avoid a similar fate.
</P>
<P>
   For the actors, Spielberg's reality tour of the war began early
with a seven-day boot camp run by Marine Capt. Dale Dye, a veteran
of four tours of Vietnam. Dye has worked with filmmakers for the
past decade to lend authenticity to war movies like ``Platoon'' and
``Born on the Fourth of July.'' Dye's job with ``Saving Private
Ryan'' was particularly choice _ for him, at least. He make Hanks
and other members of the ensemble cast look like soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   To ensure authenticity, Spielberg asked him to save any pity _
not that he needed to add that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted it to be difficult because they're actors,''
Spielberg says. ``I didn't want them to come on the set complaining
that they didn't have any carpet in their motor homes. I wanted
them to understand that making this movie was going to be a taxing
physical ordeal. And even more importantly, I wanted them to
understand what it was like to be an American GI. And I thought
they needed to go through the wringer a bit to learn that.''
</P>
<P>
   Go through the wringer they did. ``Private Ryan's'' actors hail
mostly from the independent film world, including Ed Burns (``The
Brothers McMullen''), Jeremy Davies (``Spanking the Monkey'') and
Adam Goldberg (``Dazed and Confused''). Tom Sizemore (``Heat,''
``Natural Born Killers'') brings his age and heft as the unit's
war-weary, veteran sergeant, and Matt Damon, cast before ``Good
Will Hunting'' made him a household name, plays the missing title
character. All except Damon _ who portrays the soldier the unit is
trying to find _ had to endure their seven days with Dye.
</P>
<P>
   Mornings began with intense calisthenics and long runs in wool
uniforms and 40-pound packs. The actors learned to assemble their
weapons and brandish a bayonet. Meals were strictly army rations _
beef liver, laced with salt peter, eaten out of a can _ and nights
were often spent crawling around in the mud during simulated Nazi
attacks. And since it rained six of the boot camp's seven days,
cast members were always wet, even at night in their wobbly tents.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone hated it, and at one point, the actors voted to go
home. Only Hanks _ remaining true to his Boy Scout image _
dissented, eventually persuading the others to tough it out, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``Really, we could have used two weeks instead of one,'' Hanks
says. ``All I told them was that 20 years from now, they'd look
back at this experience and be glad they went through it.''
</P>
<P>
   For most, it hasn't taken that long.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, I hated it and, no, I didn't really understand why we
had to do it at the time,'' says Vin Diesel, who plays the unit's
tough-talking Italian, Pvt. Caparzo. ``Guys were crying, there were
swollen ankles, cuts, bruises and a lot of pain. Basically, we all
felt emasculated.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But,'' Diesel adds, ``I'll never forget Capt. Dye telling us
about the emotional approach to being a soldier. How you'll go
through three months of training with a guy, you get close to him
more than your wife and then the day comes and you're on the
battlefield and he gets killed. And what do you feel? Hurt?
Despair? Anger? Rage? No. You feel joy because he got it and you
didn't. And then you can't sleep for three nights because you feel
the guilt of betrayal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stuff like that really made you think and want to do right by
these veterans.''
</P>
<P>
   Several of the cast members still seem haunted by the experience
and the movie. Sizemore and Burns say they wept after watching the
film for the first time, ``and I was on the set every day, so I
knew what to expect,'' Sizemore says. Others, like history buff
Damon, admit they're still in awe over the sacrifices these
soldiers made so others could be free.
</P>
<P>
   ``I asked myself a lot of tough questions after seeing this
movie,'' says the 27-year-old Damon. ``My generation is typically
portrayed as apathetic. You see people on `Sally Jessy Raphael'
complaining they weren't breast-fed long enough. So this movie made
me feel pretty guilty for taking a lot for granted.''
</P>
<P>
   That's a message that a lot of people could take to heart. But
because of the mvie's unrelenting violence, there will be some
question about whether it is appropriate for younger ages.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, it is rated R and there's a reason for that,'' Hanks
says. ``War is R-rated. Actually, it's worse than that. But I think
this movie might be good for kids who have watched violence on
television all their lives and played violent video games where
they're entertained by people getting their heads ripped off and
they think that's pretty cool.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe they should go see `Saving Private Ryan' because maybe
they'll just weep at the end of it. They just might understand that
if you make this conscious decision to pull the trigger and send a
piece of metal through somebody's skull, it has ramifications that
are not glamorous and not really cool.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Saving Private Ryan,'' much like a trip to the military
cemeteries in Europe, offers a grim reminder of that cold fact.

SPIELBERG'S WAR OF INDEPENDENCE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GLENN WHIPP  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; Steven Spielberg loved his fantasies so much that
he made the world share them.
</P>
<P>
   Arguably the most talented member of the generation of film
directors that took over Hollywood in the 1970s, Spielberg was the
least interested in addressing reality in his work. And that made
him the most popular director in movie history.
</P>
<P>
   But after a decade of immersing himself _ and us _ in killer
sharks, benevolent aliens and whip-cracking pulp heroes, Spielberg
began casting his imaginative eye on more plausible, often
profoundly disturbing subjects. Beginning with the 1985 ``The Color
Purple,'' he balanced the derring-do and latter-day dinosaur rides
with increasingly complicated and demanding explorations into the
kinds of hard, historical truths that Hollywood, and especially the
Hollywood that Spielberg dominated, uses all its tricks to deny and
deflect our attention from.
</P>
<P>
   This approach resulted in one of the most beloved and admired
films of all time, the uncompromising Holocaust drama ``Schindler's
List.'' It's also given us ``Empire of the Sun'' and ``Amistad,''
both perceived as rare Spielberg failures but, in fact, rigorous
and probing examinations of what's emerging as the director's great
theme: the elusive, often contradictory and always costly struggle
for freedom.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps these films express a struggle within Spielberg, that of
a serious artist trying to emerge from the shadow of a consummate
showman. With his new film, ``Saving Private Ryan,'' a horrendously
graphic depiction of the D-Day landing and its brutalizing
aftermath, Spielberg may be digging for something deeper, though:
proving the adage the truth will set you free.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ryan'' is honestly ambiguous enough to be labeled many things.
But one of them is definitely Spielberg's declaration of
independence from his own enslavement to the Hollywood fantasies
that conquered his imagination as a child.
</P>
<P>
   ``My dad, who's 81 now, fought in the air force in Burma in
World War II,'' says Spielberg. ``He had reunions with his fighter
squad a lot, so, as a kid I had occasion to hear them telling
stories about what it was actually like _ stories that were so
different from the movies that Hollywood was showing me. I didn't
know who to believe, but I chose to believe the war movies because
my dad's stories were so outrageously harsh.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Then I realized that my dad had been telling the truth all
along and Hollywood had been fibbing about what it was like. For 50
years, most films about World War II have been sanitized. During
the war, the movies were almost what we would call a recruitment
tool, showing the honor and the glory of serving your country to
get a lot of young men to enlist. After the war, films glorified
our victories. They made audiences understand the sacrifices, too,
but in a way that was always very safe and wholly untrue.''
</P>
<P>
   Spielberg has set a number of films _ the Indiana Jones
adventures, the misfired comedy ``1941,'' ``Empire'' and
``Schindler's'' _ in the wartime and immediate pre-war eras. But
for his first real combat film, he vowed ``to acquit the veterans
and what they experienced, as opposed to using World War II as just
another springboard for an action-adventure movie.''
</P>
<P>
   Based on a fictional script by Robert Rodat, informed by
numerous veterans' accounts and by Stephen E. Ambrose's acclaimed
nonfiction books ``Citizen Soldiers,'' ``Band of Brothers'' and
``D-Day: June 6, 1944: The Climactic Battle of World War II,''
``Ryan'' set out to depict the chaos and horror of battle like no
movie ever had before.
</P>
<P>
   The 24-minute, Normandy landing sequence that opens the film,
for example, is an unflinching blood bath, a GI's scrambling view
of fire, blood, men being torn apart, deafening noise and
overwhelming fear.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew nothing, but I learned from the people who were
there,'' Spielberg notes. ``I thought Omaha Beach was a victory. I
thought Normandy was a victory; we got everybody on shore, after
all, and we began to push inland the next day. I didn't realize,
until I began reading Ambrose and talking to Omaha veterans, that
it was a chaotic disaster.''
</P>
<P>
   Though the German defenders put up their toughest fight against
the invaders at the Omaha landing site, by the end of June 6 all
five Normandy beaches had been secured. But it would be months
before Allied forces fought their way into the rest of France.
``Ryan'' regroups a few days after the landing, when a squad of
eight D-Day survivors led by Capt. Miller (Tom Hanks) is ordered
behind enemy lines to find a paratrooper, Matt Damon's Pvt. Ryan,
lost in the thoroughly botched, pre-invasion airdrop.
</P>
<P>
   His three brothers had been killed within the same week, so the
U.S. Command wants to send Ryan home intact to his grieving mother.
Providing he's still alive, or that the eight resentful men in
Miller's squad can find him before they're all killed.
</P>
<P>
   Although this main part of the movie explores the truly knotty
issues more associated with films about the Vietnam War than
America's idealized Good War, it's that bloodily realistic D-Day
sequence that has everybody talking.
</P>
<P>
   Is it too grisly for audience sensibilities conditioned by
decades of glamorized, as well as sanitized, movie violence? Should
it have earned the film an NC-17 rating, instead of the R it got?
Should the director-executive have been less graphic in the hope of
greater box-office acceptance _ especially since DreamWorks, the
mega-company he heads with Jeffrey Katzenberg and David Geffen, has
yet to enjoy the kind of blockbuster hits like ``Mask of Zorro,''
``Men in Black'' and ``The Lost World'' Spielberg still produces
for other studios?
</P>
<P>
   ``I have the freedom to make a movie like `Saving Private Ryan'
necessarily rough,'' he says, ``as opposed to having a studio boss
say, `Distill it and water it down like all those other World War
II movies, so maybe we can make a profit.' If I shoot myself in the
foot by making `Private Ryan' too much of a tough journey, at least
I made that choice. And that's what success allows you.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I really wanted to give the audience a physical experience,
not just a voyeuristic one. I did everything in my power to create
a visceral, honest look back at something that actually happened.
If the film had been rated NC-17, I would have accepted the rating
without protest. But I would not have cut the film.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I think there are people who will submit to the film. It's
a very potent cocktail, and people will be both shaken and stirred
by it. And if they give it a chance, there will be those who say,
`It's too real,' and there are others who will say, `I think it was
a very honest re-creation.'''
</P>
<P>
   Shot on a Normandy-like stretch of the Irish coast (with the
Irish army, as it did for ``Braveheart,'' supplying hundreds of
extras), the D-Day sequence was filmed during four six-day weeks,
more or less in the chronological continuity with which it unfolds
on screen.
</P>
<P>
   Always the consummate formal geniuses, Spielberg and his
director of photography, Janusz Kaminski, shot the whole thing with
handheld, unstabilized cameras from low angles, approximating the
``scared-of-getting-their-heads-shot-off'' perspective of real
combat photographers. Sixty percent of the footage's color
saturation then was drained out, giving the images a slightly
antique quality that somehow enhances, rather than mutes, their
horror.
</P>
<P>
   When such artistry is put in the service of locating visual
truth, can the creator go back to the business of making really
convincing-looking velociraptors?
</P>
<P>
   ``I can always wear two hats, believe me,'' Spielberg says.
``I'm not a born-again sociologist with a camera. I love
entertainment, I understand how to do that kind of picture _ and
I'm learning how to do a picture like this.''
</P>
<P>
   And learning from it. While his commitment to more mindless fare
sounds solid, Spielberg also is nursing some serious doubts about
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're always going to make movies that are entertaining, and
that trade on violence for entertainment,'' he says. ``That's just
the reality of the industry. But you know, the problem these days _
and I am right in the middle of the culpability for this, so please
don't think I'm this holier-than-thou person giving a lecture _ is
that we've desensitized audiences through violence that is both
entertaining and creative.''
</P>
<P>
   And, it might be added, with movies that are simultaneously
stimulating, reassuring and manipulative in patently false ways.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a sense, I feel that `Schindler's List' and now `Saving
Private Ryan' can re-sensitize people to realistic experiences'' at
the movies, he says. ``They're not just saying, `You're going to be
safe voyeurs in this movie theater.'

   ``I'm asking a lot of the audience,'' he acknowledges, and in
that realization you can detect the risk and exhilaration that
always accompanies liberation. ``I'm asking them to participate in
the experience of those soldiers who had to do their jobs.''

`PRIVATE RYAN' POUNDS AWAY LIKE GERMAN BLITZKRIEG
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
OUR RATING: 4 Stars 
By BOB STRAUSS  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ If you don't want to see the horrible things that
combat can do to the human body, then don't go to ``Saving Private
Ryan.'' But, if you don't mind seeing it as part of watching a
great story unfold, then by all means go to ``Private Ryan.''
</P>
<P>
   Simple as that. But the answer to this dubiously overdebated
aspect of Steven Spielberg's latest and finest movie is the only
thing about it that's simple.
</P>
<P>
   Marshaling all the cinematic skill and storytelling instincts at
his formidable command, Spielberg hasn't just made a picture that
looks as artfully awful as war can be. He's made an unflinching _
and because of that, truly respectful _ examination of what it can
do to men's behavior as well as their bodies.
</P>
<P>
   More than any war movie I can remember, ``Saving Private Ryan''
shows us how soldiers think, from moment to moment and (though much
less often) about the wider, murkier reasons why they're risking
their lives and taking others.
</P>
<P>
   And how those thoughts are put into action, running the gamut
from noble to appalling, with all the contradiction and ambiguity
these tired, terrified and bitterly conflicted infantrymen can
muster.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ryan'' is significantly set in World War II _ the one we
fought for all the right reasons _ and at the point of our most
significant victory. It was also a bloody fiasco: the D-Day landing
at Omaha Beach. The symbolic tensions these events represent,
between decency and brutality and winning while taking insane
punishment, inform every step the movie goes on to make.
</P>
<P>
   First, however, Normandy. In an allied landing craft, men are
tense, vomiting, whispering to God (when things really get bad a
few minutes later, they'll cry for the more certain comfort of
their mothers). A competent-looking captain, John Miller (Tom
Hanks), realizes his hand is shaking. It's the first of many
conditions he's not going to have much control over.
</P>
<P>
   The landing ramp opens, the front ranks instantly disintegrate,
it gets worse from there. Guys drown in the too-deep, reddening
water. Those who make the beach lose limbs, guts, minds. The
graphic butchery is devastatingly enhanced by trembling, handheld
camerawork and desperate, rat-trap cutting (Spielberg's usual
brilliant collaborators, cinematographer Janusz Kaminski and editor
Michael Kahn, do career-best work here).
</P>
<P>
   Just as shocking, though, the cold calculus of war begins to
establish terrible order on the blasting chaos. Mental cruelty
takes the beach, stoking the agony.
</P>
<P>
   What's a GI to think, crouched behind the iron obstacle that is
his only protection from withering German fire, when told the tank
trap must be cleared by one of his side's engineers?
</P>
<P>
   And what are we to think when, against ferocious resistance,
Miller and his squad's remnants finally force a German surrender,
and they _ the true champions of freedom, the men who saved the
world from darkness, our dads _ murder their captives?
</P>
<P>
   Of course, things like this happened. Intellectually, we know
the war was won by slaughter. But we're simply not conditioned to
think that our GIs, so thoroughly on the side of good in this one,
behaved as soldiers under fire, always have and always will.
Spielberg isn't out to make ``Private Ryan'' a Vietnam movie in
'40s drag, though. These are not symbols of a powerful nation's
underlying pathology, They're still courageous, honorable,
well-meaning, heroic men _ but only men.
</P>
<P>
   The great insight that Spielberg lavishes on every frame, in a
kaleidoscope of different ways, is that, right or wrong, all wars
place their soldiers on the same ethical frontline. And never with
adequate defense.
</P>
<P>
   A few days after the landing, it's discovered that three boys
from an Iowa family named Ryan have been killed within days of each
other. A fourth son, a paratrooper, is somewhere in Normandy, maybe
still alive. Miller's squad is sent into the contested countryside
to find the possibly remaining Ryan so he can be shipped back home.
</P>
<P>
   Eight men risked to save one. Is that right? Should Ryan's
mother, the kind of thing we're theoretically fighting for over
there, suffer more if it can possibly be prevented?
</P>
<P>
   No and, of course, no. Caught in that vice grip of conflicting
moral imperatives, what can Miller and company do? Gripe, argue,
wonder what the hell they've gotten themselves into, sure. But
mostly, they just try to stay alive, do their duty and, if
possible, preserve their souls.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of other unanswerable questions arise before the squad
reaches its last stand, a blasted French town where, with a few
straggling paratroops, they defend a strategic bridge from
overwhelmingly superior, counterattacking Panzers. Even more
impressive than the D-Day sequence, this battle, unfolding in close
to real time, is a sounding, furious symphony of _ more
contradictions _ confusion and tactical ingenuity, cowardice and
bravery, surreal surprise and the grinding advance of military
inevitability.
</P>
<P>
   I've never been in war, and I know Spielberg hasn't either, so
I'll reserve judgment on whether he approximates it better than a
soldier-director like Oliver Stone has. I can say, however, that
``Private Ryan's'' climactic battle left me with a pounding
headache, my neck in knots, and emotionally drained like nothing
I've seen before. All of that in a good way, of course. But it's
the closest I ever want to get to the real thing.
</P>
<P>
   Quibbles can be made about Robert Rodat's script. The men in
Miller's squad are types stamped out of numerous war movies past:
the gruff, dependable sergeant (Tom Sizemore), the problematic New
Yorker (Edward Burns), the Scripture-quoting Tennessee sharpshooter
(Barry Pepper), the Italian street tough with a heart too golden
for his own good (Vin Diesel).
</P>
<P>
   Only the Jewish Pvt. Mellish (Adam Goldberg), who gets an
understandable charge out of taunting German prisoners, and Cpl.
Upham (Jeremy Davies), a meek translator who's dragooned into the
mission and generally represents the civilian's point of view,
suffer transcendentally interesting moments.
</P>
<P>
   Matt Damon plays the elusive Pvt. Ryan as a more idealized
citizen soldier than the men we spend more time with. There have
been some complaints that this character's final scene cheapens the
movie with simplistic sentimentality.
</P>
<P>
   Arguable, but hogwash. Pvt. Ryan's last words give voice to what
every man we've seen in the movie, and what most men who fought the
good fight for the good cause, had to think at those moments when
goodness had nothing to do with it. It's a perfect coda to this
difficult masterpiece, posing as it does the ultimate question that
has no easy answer.

`PI' EQUALS EDGY MATH MOVIE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
OUR RATING: 3 Stars 
By BOB STRAUSS  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Higher math scares most of us. Writer-director
Darren Aronofsky employs this basic truth as a jumping-off point
for his dementedly clever, award-winning feature debut ``Pi.''
</P>
<P>
   A low-budget thriller (Aronofsky got friends and relatives to
invest $100 each) with horror movie overtones and more imagination
than it can comfortably contain, ``Pi'' reinforces the heartfelt
assumption, shared by anyone who flunked calculus, that numbers can
drive you nuts.
</P>
<P>
   That's sure what's happening to ``Pi's'' prophetically named
Maximillian Cohen (Sean Gullette). Holed up in his dingy New York
apartment, all but personally wired-up to a jerry-built, tubes- and
wires-sprouting computer called Euclid, the obsessed Max is trying
to figure out the mathematical key to everything in the universe
(although he'd settle for a formula that just cracks the stock
market).
</P>
<P>
   Utterly anti-social, Max's only desired human contact is with
Sol (Mark Margolis), a former professor whose own deep math
explorations led to a stroke. But the world has a way of seeking
out the disinterested Max, most emphatically in the form of Wall
Street functionary Marcy Dawson (Pamela Hart) and Talmudic scholar
Lenny Meyer (Ben Shenkman). The former has purely profit-motivated
reasons. The latter thinks Max's theories will help his similarly
obsessed rabbi break some numerical code that will reveal the true
meaning of the Torah and, by extension, God.
</P>
<P>
   Each camp will stoop to the most coercive means necessary in
order to pick Max's brain. The trouble is, that increasingly
fevered organ is undergoing ever more frequent seizures, and the
indispensable Euclid is crashing from the strain, too.
</P>
<P>
   Filmed in high-contrast black and white, ``Pi'' is overloaded
with disorienting camera tricks _ overlapping images, time-lapse,
extreme close-ups and such _ meant to evoke Max's subjective,
paranoically deteriorating mental state. On the other side of the
equation, his brilliant fascination with geometric forms is given
poetic life by oddly lovely shots of leafy trees and cream
spiraling in coffee.
</P>
<P>
   Mostly, though, ``Pi'' is a frantic sensory assault that feels,
more than anything, like watching and hearing ``Eraserhead'' for
the first time all over again. On fast-forward.
</P>
<P>
   Definitely not everyone's cup of cream-circling coffee, ``Pi''
may be relentless, but its form fits its content. Aronofsky matches
every assaultive aural and visual idea with an intriguing,
intellectual one. His only sin, really, is putting more of it into
one movie than most of us can calculate.

SHARING THE NOSTALGIA ON NOSTALGIC FILM
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB McCARTHY  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Candy Clark recalls the cold. Cindy Williams
thinks of bad hair. Ad-libbed lines come back to Charles Martin
Smith. Meanwhile, the precocious Mackenzie Phillips was having the
time of her life, and Kathleen Quinlan was in awe.
</P>
<P>
   These co-stars of ``American Graffiti'' reunited July 17 with
director George Lucas for a 25th-anniversary celebration and
screening of this ode to cruising and crossing the threshold into
adulthood at the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences'
Goldwyn Theatre in Beverly Hills. The audience members _ some of
whom were too young to have seen the movie in 1973 _ cheered
through the opening credits and spontaneously for the nostalgic one
hour, 50-minute collage of teenhood, street rods, aimless summer
and oldies radio.
</P>
<P>
   The audience reserved some of its loudest applause for the late
Wolfman Jack, who played himself, and for Harrison Ford, who was
unable to attend. All members of the talented ensemble cast, with
the exception of Ford, Ron Howard, Suzanne Somers and Richard
Dreyfuss, participated in a panel discussion after the screening.
</P>
<P>
   The collective cast, crew and director Lucas shivered through
the 28-night shoot on the streets of Petaluma and San Rafael in the
early 1970s. The sting of those chilly nights has stuck with the
actors, who in some scenes ducked down in the back seats of cars
during filming to stay warm.
</P>
<P>
   Lucas revealed that Universal executives were unhappy with the
film, even to the point of being embarrassed to exhibit it. But at
its initial screenings, ``American Graffiti'' blew away audiences _
and the studio's reservations _ a la John Milner (Paul Le Mat's
character) racing down Paradise Road.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most difficult thing was that the first cut of the film
came out to be three hours. We spent the next six months trying to
get it to two hours and stay as good,'' Lucas explained, calling
the whittling process the single biggest challenge of ``American
Graffiti.''
</P>
<P>
   Clark, who played the role of the big-haired and big-hearted
Debbie, was asked by moderator Leonard Maltin about that shock of
blond hair she sported.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a wig,'' the now sun-bleached actress gushed.
``Actually, that wig was made of yak hair. I and the hairdresser
picked it out because it wouldn't lose its curl. It would just
swell in the dampness.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a hairdresser?'' Cindy Williams shot up in disbelief.
Seeing herself again in ``American Graffiti'' brought back hair
memories for the petite Williams, who still wears a short style.
The words ``hated it'' pretty much sum it up.
</P>
<P>
   Williams revealed that when she heard a film titled ``American
Graffiti'' was being made, she didn't have a clue what it was
about. A look at the script, however, and she was begging for a
role. Only, being the good-girl Laurie wasn't what she had in mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to play Debbie or Mackenzie's part (Carol). I would
have put braces on my teeth,'' she said in mock desperation.
</P>
<P>
   It was less of a reunion and more of a get-acquainted session
for Quinlan, who was just a baby-sitting teen-ager when she
attended the mass audition for a girl to play Laurie's friend Peg
at the sock hop. Despite being on a movie set with Howard and
Williams, she felt right at home.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was my high school,'' she said, motioning to the other
cast members. ``I didn't even meet most of you. You all were movie
stars to me.''
</P>
<P>
   She later was reunited with Howard, this time as her director,
more than 20 years later on ``Apollo 13.'' She played the wife of
astronaut Jim Lovell on the ill-fated mission to the moon.
</P>
<P>
   Bo Hopkins, the ringleader of the Pharoahs, had his own
greasy-hair memories, and he figured his accent in the film was
``halfway between Gomer Pyle and David Brinkley.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I figured the guy (his character Joe) had heard New York guys
and tried to sound like them,'' he added in his natural drawl.
</P>
<P>
   A radiant Phillips, who is a recovering substance abuser, was
brutally honest about how this surprise hit took the then
12-year-old from a lead in grammar school performances to celebrity
status in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``It opened so many doors for me that I proceeded to shut
myself,'' Phillips said candidly. ``It was a wonderful experience
for me. They treated me like a little sister. And riding in that
car with Paul Le Mat ... ooh.'
</P>
<P>
   Smith, who called himself a ``serious actor studying at Cal
State Northridge at the time,'' was surprised at how many flubs
Lucas edited into the film.
</P>
<P>
   ``He would always assure me, `If we need to, we can shoot that
again later,''' Smith said, spinning his own yarn. ``And then, he'd
edit it in.''

`HEADHUNTERS' REUNITE FOR DIZZY SESSION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRED SHUSTER 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
HEADHUNTERS/``Return of the Headhunters'' (Hancock Records/Verve
Forecast)
<TEXT>
<P>
   Herbie Hancock's ``Headhunters'' album was a '70s jazz-fusion
smash that spawned one of the great two-chord funk workouts of all
time in ``Chameleon.'' Now, that seminal band has reunited with
help from Hancock, singer N'dea Davenport, keyboardist Billy Childs
and guitarist JK for a mildly interesting collection of jazz-funk
tunes that recall the adventurous Weather Report in some spots. The
unsung hero of the album is drummer Michael Clark, whose
paradiddles and other sorts of diddles are just plain dizzying
throughout. 2{ Stars. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
GILLIAN WELCH/``Hell Among the Yearlings'' (Almo Sounds)
</P>
<P>
   Contemporary folkie Welch's superb sophomore effort opens with
the tale of a woman who kills a man as he attacks her. The song,
``Caleb Meyer,'' sets the tone for what comes next. Although she
comes from Hollywood, Welch sounds as if she was raised shoeless
and penniless in the Appalachian mountains. These new tunes,
co-written with longtime partner David Rawlings and produced by
T-Bone Burnett, include such stark, stirring titles as ``Devil Had
a Hold of Me,'' ``My Morphine'' and ``Winter's Come &AMP; Gone,'' songs
that equal her outstanding debut album of three years ago. 3{
Stars. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
AHMAD JAMAL/``Nature: The Essence Part 3'' (Birdology/Atlantic)
</P>
<P>
   Journeyman jazz pianist Jamal has long believed in the trio
format. Here, he merges the sound of sturdy bass and drums with
steel drum and, on a few cuts, the tenor sax of Stanley Turrentine.
It's a straight-ahead session that includes lyrical ballads and
fast-paced pieces. Among the standouts are ``And We Were Lovers''
from the movie ``The Sand Pebbles,'' the nuanced steel drums-piano
duet on Jamal's ``If I Find You Again'' and the ``Cabin in the
Sky'' medley. 3 Stars. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
DON BYRON/``Nu Blaxploitation'' (Blue Note)
</P>
<P>
   Clarinetist-composer Byron's previous projects have spanned
klezmer, Afro-Cuban and avant-garde jazz. On his latest effort,
though, his ego gets the best of him. While the disc has its
moments _ Pink Floyd guitarist David Gilmore's solo on
``Fencewalk,'' for example _ the album gets bogged down in tepid
spoken-word segments and ill-advised pseudo-political rants
targeting the O.J. Simpson trial's Mark Fuhrman. There are even two
versions of something called ``Domino Theories,'' in which band
members discuss everyday events over (you guessed it) a domino
game. Byron tries hard to dodge labels, but the one that sticks
best is must-to-avoid. 1 Star. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
SUSAN JAMES/``Fantastic Voyage: A Double Album'' (Red Letter
Records)
</P>
<P>
   Ambitious local singer-songwriter James has won a loyal
following. This self-produced and financed two-disc set, consisting
of 10 mostly marvelous new songs and 10 atmospheric instrumentals,
should win her many more. This diverse and enjoyable album features
such guests as ex-Replacements bassist Tommy Stinson and top tunes
like ``Every Side of Lonely,'' ``Spinning Down'' and ``Love &AMP; Luck
&AMP; Sin.'' 3 Stars. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
BAUHAUS/``Crackle'' (Beggars Banquet)
</P>
<P>
   Despite the clamor that met Bauhaus' reunion tour stop in
Hollywood a few weeks ago, the music on this best-of collection
seems badly dated. Most of the time, the band's attempts at
scratchy '80s minimalism bring to mind the Cure without the sense
of melody. Lead singer Peter Murphy doesn't sound nearly as dark
and mysterious as he became in his later years, and the version
here of David Bowie's ``Ziggy Stardust'' just points out Bauhaus'
primary influence. 2 Stars. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
GRANT GEISSMAN/``In With the Out Crowd'' (Higher Octave Jazz)
</P>
<P>
   A sticker on this album trumpets that this is some type of
acid-jazz project. Actually, nothing could be further from the
truth. Although local guitarist Geissman kicks out the jams in the
style of George Benson or Cornell Dupree on the first few
blues-drenched tracks, he quickly develops a bad case of
smooth-jazz-itis and reverts to a soft acoustic sound. Jazz radio
will love this record, but fans of true-life blowing sessions
should steer clear. 2{ Stars.

ALL THE GOOD NEWS THAT'S FIT TO PRINT 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROB MORSE  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ People always ask why there isn't more good news
in newspapers. A suburban Phoenix paper called the Tribune actually
tried to put out an all-good news edition on Tuesday, renamed ``The
Good News Tribune'' for the day.
</P>
<P>
   It featured stories like how delicious suburban Phoenix tap
water has become. Never mind that Arizona may run out of tap water
in the not-so-distant future. I guess the good-news headline then
will be ``Scottsdale golf courses dry up and blow away.''
</P>
<P>
   It got me thinking. It may be possible to present all kinds of
news as good news, perhaps even San Francisco news. Therefore I
present the first all-good-news San Francisco column:
</P>
<P>
   ``Rookie Muni driver doesn't have third crash.''
</P>
<P>
   As of this writing, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   This unnamed new driver lost control of a bus on her second day
of work early in June, and took out trees, a parking meter and a
hydrant on Geary Boulevard. Last Friday her bus jumped a curb when
it rolled away from a bus stop.
</P>
<P>
   That's another good-news headline: ``No one killed in two
crashes by rookie Muni driver.''
</P>
<P>
   Or you could put it the way Muni boss Emilio Cruz put it on
``Mornings on 2'': ``It wasn't an accident _ it was an oversight.''
</P>
<P>
   You see, she forgot to set the emergency brake when she got out
of the bus, which I would call lack of foresight.
</P>
<P>
   ``Policy generously offers reporters mints.''
</P>
<P>
   That's about the only good news, or any news, at Carmen Policy's
press conference announcing his resignation from the San Francisco
49ers on Wednesday. On every reporter's chair at the Burlingame
Marriott, someone had placed a notebook, a pen and a chocolate
mint.
</P>
<P>
   You know, the kind of mint they put on pillows in hotels. What
does that mean? You will sleep with the mints?
</P>
<P>
   And sleep they did at this weird press conference. The only
interesting thing Policy said was how he hasn't always meant it
this year when he has wished Eddie DeBartolo the best, but now he
really means it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Policy leaves. Western civilization survives.''
</P>
<P>
   After all the news coverage, it's hard to believe, but true.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mayor Brown doesn't tick off every resident of San
Francisco.''
</P>
<P>
   No, just tenants, who are 70 percent of the population.
</P>
<P>
   Tenants groups say they'll fight a proposed $503 million bond to
rebuild Laguna Honda Hospital if the cost is passed on to renters.
Recently, Brown persuaded the Board of Supervisors to pass on
bond-related tax hikes to renters instead of landlords, who are
coincidentally represented by Brown's friend and consultant Jack
Davis.
</P>
<P>
   Brown could lose the next election, if he had an opponent. Now
that would be a good-news headline.
</P>
<P>
   ``BART to provide world's longest stretch limousines to
airport.''
</P>
<P>
   That's what they'll be calling them, when the fare to the
airport from San Francisco is $4.50, as projected when the line is
supposed to open in 2001, a BART odyssey. Maybe transit agency's
cars will even have hot tubs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oakland promotes bicycling.''
</P>
<P>
   The city on the other side of the San Francisco Bay confiscates
cars belonging to those arrested for allegedly soliciting drugs or
prostitution, even though the drivers haven't been convicted.
They're guilty until proven innocent, and carless forever.
</P>
<P>
   Why doesn't Oakland confiscate cars belonging to individuals who
solicit for stadiums? Or why doesn't Mayor Jerry Brown ban cars
altogether, thereby reducing gaseous emissions other than his own
speeches?
</P>
<P>
   ``California schools not as bad as we thought.''
</P>
<P>
   A new achievement test shows that California's scores are below
the national average, but not at the very bottom.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, educators (as they call themselves) expected the worst, and
they only got the pretty bad. If the educational establishment had
high expectations, maybe the kids would out-do those, too. Maybe
high expectations are too much to ask.
</P>
<P>
   I've been trying to put a good-news spin on this one, but there
is no good news.
</P>
<P>
   This is the Golden State, the land beyond the valley of the
silicon chips, the home of great universities, and pretty soon most
citizens won't be able to read good news or bad news.
</P>
<P>
   That's very bad news.
</P>
<P>

MONICA SAYS SHE AND BRANDY STILL MIX
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRED SHUSTER 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; Teen r&AMP;b chanteuse Monica says those rumors that
she and chart-topping duet partner Brandy hate each other are pure
nonsense.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so untrue,'' Monica (last name Arnold) said. ``It's
hilarious to me now, but none of those things are true.''
</P>
<P>
   Monica released her debut, ``Miss Thang,'' three years ago at
the age of 14. Her latest, ``The Boy Is Mine'' (Arista), which
includes the No. 1 hit duet with Brandy of the same title, was just
issued.
</P>
<P>
   Brandy's new album, ``Never S-a-y Never'' (Atlantic), also
includes ``The Boy Is Mine.''
</P>
<P>
   Monica, who lives in College Park, Ga., says the duet could
never have happened if the two singers didn't blend vocally.
</P>
<P>
   ``But there were no problems at all. We worked it all out in the
studio together.''
</P>
<P>
   While Monica won't perform ``The Boy Is Mine'' unless Woodland
Hills resident Brandy is present, she revealed the two may sing the
song Sept. 10 at the 15th annual MTV Video Music Awards, where the
single is up for video of the year and best r&AMP;b video.
</P>
<P>
   Monica said the duet, which has topped the pop singles chart for
two months, was ``an event. People look at this as a new
beginning.''
</P>
<P>
   LIFE AFTER `HELL': When the Squirrel Nut Zippers scored an
alt-rock radio hit with the Cab Calloway-flavored ``Hell'' last
year, nobody was more surprised than singer-guitarist-saxophonist
Tom Maxwell.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was kind of giddy bewilderment,'' Maxwell said. ``We never
suspected alternative radio would ever give us a shot.''
</P>
<P>
   The wacky Chapel Hill, N.C., outfit's latest release,
``Perennial Favorites'' (Mammoth), is due Aug. 4, the same date the
band appears at the Palace in Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   ``We recorded this album in late 1996 _ before `Hell' ever hit
at radio,'' Maxwell explained. ``We were still touring in a van. We
found this old house and were under the impression we would turn
out a record a year.''
</P>
<P>
   When ``Hell'' became a hit, the label decided to promote the
heck out of the band's then-current release, ``Hot.''
</P>
<P>
   Maxwell said the Zippers' definition of success is unique.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't count whether we have a hit on radio or how many
units are sold,'' he said. ``But if the new record doesn't do as
well as `Hot,' my ego will be bruised because I think it's a
superior effort.''
</P>
<P>
   ALANIS ANALYZED: Just out in paperback is ``You Live, You Learn:
The Alanis Morissette Story'' (Berkley Boulevard, $5.99) by Craig
Tomashoff. The book tells of the inspiration for the lyrics on
Morissette's multimillion-selling ``Jagged Little Pill,'' among
other things.

   TIFFANY-EXHIBIT (New York) _ Austere is not the usual modifier
when it comes to Louis Comfort Tiffany. In the last two decades of
the 19th century, the interior decoration company carrying the name
of this painter-turned-designer defined the height of luxury for
wealthy, esthetically adventurous New Yorkers and set standards of
ostentatious propriety in churches across the country. But the
exhibition that the Metropolitan Museum of Art is devoting to this
leader of the Esthetic Movement, which forward-looking American
artists had imported from England by the 1870s, is startlingly
spare and understated. By Roberta Smith.
</P>
<P>
   MANHATTAN-FOREST (New York) _ As darkness falls, a burly man
lugging a boombox heads into Inwood Hill Park followed by a gaggle
of others. Your heart could sink at the prospect of Manhattan's
last stand of real forest, tucked away in the northwestern corner
of the borough, being desecrated by loud music. But hold on. The
fellow in front is Michael Feller, the parks department's senior
naturalist. He is leading a newly offered nocturnal tour of the
190-acre park. What happens next is, to say the least, not typical
of Manhattan night life.

AWARENESS OF ALL THINGS GREAT AND SMALL 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEPHANIE SALTER  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ When I heard about the dog who'd had his
testicles replaced with silicone implants and ``never knew he lost
anything,'' I winced but figured, hey, what do I know?
</P>
<P>
   After all, it was the dog's adoring owner who claimed her
16-month-old Chinese pug ``doesn't know anything's missing, and
that's important.''
</P>
<P>
   A couple of days later though, I read about a new technique that
has been perfected by a couple of San Francisco Bay-area
scientists. Aiming for an antibody serum to fight off human viruses
and diseases, the microbiologists ``took a mouse and removed its
mouse antibody genes.''
</P>
<P>
   As one of the scientists, Nils Lonberg of GenPharm International
Inc., in Palo Alto, put it: ``They (the mice) are quite happy. They
aren't even aware of the process they're a part of.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, I am no genetic engineer or even a dog owner. But my _ you
should excuse the term _ animal instinct tells me these folks are
in denial.
</P>
<P>
   Any dog who wakes from an anesthetic with little silicone bags
where his real cojones used to be has to know something's a tad
off.
</P>
<P>
   And any mouse who has had his or her DNA stripped of its
uniquely mousey antibody genes may indeed be happy as a clam. But
the poor little devil must at least feel that things are vaguely
different than before.
</P>
<P>
   Make no mistake, I am not one who believes animals experience
everything that humans do. (I'm not proud of this, but it's a
fact.) For example, while I don't imagine that commercial chickens
enjoy living almost immobile in squashed coops until they're fat
enough to have their heads cut off, I don't think they ``know''
that life is far better out there for their free-range
counterparts.
</P>
<P>
   Same for cows, pigs, ducks, fish and, yes, once in awhile,
lambs.
</P>
<P>
   Nor do I fool myself about the kind of end they all come to. But
_ ``Babe'' notwithstanding _ I don't believe the critters know
about the end. And that enables me to eat them with a relatively
free conscience.
</P>
<P>
   What I do believe though is that all living creatures, plants
included, have an instinctive ``sense'' of inner balance. Mess with
the status quo and, don't kid yourself, the creature is aware of
the messing.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe this sense is what some people call a soul, the connection
between all life and its eternal creative source (aka God). The
soul ``knows'' when fundamental alterations have been made, even if
the soul can do nothing about it.
</P>
<P>
   The head of the company that manufactures the silicone canine
testicles _ called Neuticles Naturals _ says his product is
supposed to diminish trauma by making the dog think nothing has
occurred.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the original polypropeline Neuticals, which resemble big
marbles, the silicone implants have ``the feel and texture of a
gummie bear,'' said CTI Corp. President Gregg Miller.
</P>
<P>
   OK. I'll buy the idea that Frodo, the 16-month-old Chinese pug
who went to sleep with his own equipment and woke up with gummie
bears, was not as bewildered as he would have been had he awakened
with marbles.
</P>
<P>
   But nothing will convince me that, like those mice with the
disappeared antibody genes, Frodo's soul ``doesn't know anything's
missing.''
</P>
<P>

   TEHRAN, Iran _ Bring your conservative clothes, leave your
alcohol and credit cards behind. Iran's mountains, mosques and
mullahs await you.
</P>
<P>
   With hints that relations between the United States and Iran
could warm up, Iranian officials say they are seeing an increase in
American tourists in the land of ancient Persia.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tourism is a great thing for developing peace and
friendship,'' said Iranian tourism director Mohsen Emami in a
recent interview with Cox News Service.
</P>
<P>
   Iranian officials say 4,184 people visited Iran with U.S.
passports in 1997, up from 3,478 the year before. Those could
include tourists, business people, journalists or expatriate
Iranians visiting their homeland.
</P>
<P>
   Americans are still a tiny portion of the nearly 700,000
visitors last year, but their increasing numbers appear to coincide
with the election last year of Iranian President Mohammed Khatami,
seen as a more moderate leader than his predecessors.
</P>
<P>
   It's good news to a country with a sluggish economy and an image
problem.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Iranian takeover of the U.S. Embassy in 1979, starting
a 444-day hostage ordeal for 52 Americans, Iranians have been seen
largely as anti-American religious zealots.
</P>
<P>
   But visitors get a different view. Iranians are usually friendly
and hospitable. There is very little crime and plenty of upscale
hotels.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very happy to see you,''' said Tina Patterson, director
of group travel for Distant Horizons, a Long Beach, Calif., agency
that books trips to Iran.
</P>
<P>
   For about $5,000 per person, Distant Horizons sends Americans on
18-day tours.
</P>
<P>
   The country has plenty of sites. There are ornate mosques and
museums and bazaars lined with Persian carpets. The Caspian (Sea)
region to the north offers cool mountains and caviar. Tehran has a
ski resort nearby.
</P>
<P>
   Americans will also notice the building-sized murals depicting
ayatollahs and, in some, warnings against U.S. aggression.
</P>
<P>
   There are adjustments that must be made to conform with Islamic
law.
</P>
<P>
   Like Iranian women, western women must keep their hair covered
with scarves and their bodies covered with capes or raincoats. Long
sleeves are recommended for the men.
</P>
<P>
   Non-married couples traveling together will have to say they are
married if they want to share a hotel room.
</P>
<P>
   No alcohol is permitted and, because of a U.S. economic embargo,
credit cards from U.S. banks are worthless. Also, there is a $100
limit on bringing Iranian goods into the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Travel in groups is recommended to help avoid bureaucratic
problems with visas. Officials with the U.S. State Department,
which still tells Americans to avoid Iran, warn that there is no
U.S. embassy there to help travelers in trouble. American concerns
are handled at the Swiss embassy in Tehran.

<P>
   TEHRAN, Iran _ Maybe this 18-year-old Iranian is a sign of
things to come.
</P>
<P>
   Farhat Malek's hair is slicked and a Michael Jordan jersey peeks
out from under the large Iranian flag draped over his shoulders --
his attire for watching the two countries' soccer teams square off
last month.
</P>
<P>
   He is hopeful, but realistic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Iran and the United States have had a little war these last 20
years,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Just this week, reports emerged that Iran recently tested
missiles that, in a few years, could reach American allies like
Israel and Saudi Arabia. The history of the ``little war'' between
the two adversaries includes a captured American embassy, a
shot-down Iranian airliner, an American embargo and 19 years of
angry rhetoric.
</P>
<P>
   But, In the last several months, leaders in Iran and the United
States have cautiously explored better relations.
</P>
<P>
   For the U.S., a friendly Iran could enhance stability in an
oil-rich and increasingly well-armed part of the world. In
addition, U.S. companies want access to the country's market of 60
million Iranian consumers.
</P>
<P>
   For Iran, a friendly U.S. could end the embargo that has been a
drag on its economy. It could also help protect Iran from
contentious next-door neighbors in Iraq and Pakistan, which
recently tested nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Progress will require the untangling of decades of grievances,
from the symbolic to the financial. But, the time might be right
for solutions.
</P>
<P>
   Iran is a young country. Half its population is under 20 years
old and many, like the young Malek, say the ritual chant of ``Death
to America'' at Friday prayers is a has-been slogan with a
dwindling audience.
</P>
<P>
   In Tehran, you can see old Chevy Camaros and Ford Mustangs
speeding past ``Down with U.S.A.'' graffiti on city walls. Leonardo
DiCaprio T-shirts are common and, though Islamic laws ban it from
theaters, ``Titanic,'' is a hit on the widespread black-market
video circuit.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a U.S. embargo, American consumer goods are common, if
over-priced, and people lunch at imitations of American restaurant
chains.
</P>
<P>
   But, the average Iranian also believes that the United States,
which did supply weaponry to Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein,
orchestrated the costly eight-year Iraqi-Iran war in which more
than 240,000 Iranians died.
</P>
<P>
   They know that the U.S. propped up the brutal Shah of Iran, who
Iranians toppled with the Islamic Revolution in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   Any doubts they might have about whether the U.S. had evil
intentions were erased in 1988, when a U.S. Navy ship shot down an
Iranian airliner, killing more than 200 civilians.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, though consumer goods are available through third
countries, the embargo has made it difficult to get equipment for
Iran's huge oil industry and major public works projects.
</P>
<P>
   They say the U.S. policy in the Middle East centers on
dominating oil production and protecting Israel -- an enemy to
Iranians.
</P>
<P>
   However, Iran's fundamentalist leaders seem to almost go out of
their way to cause worry among not only Americans, but others. A
major avenue in Tehran is still named after the Islamic extremist
who lead the assassination of famed Egyptian President Anwar Sadat.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Iranian leaders just last year reaffirmed the bounty on
the head of British-based Salman Rushdie, author of ``The Satanic
Verses,'' a novel deemed blasphemy by Iranian clerics.
</P>
<P>
   The major U.S. grievances against Iran focus on three main
areas: Terrorism, its missile and nuclear program, and its
opposition to the Israeli-Palestinian peace process.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. State Department named Iran among seven countries that
sponsored terrorism in 1997, calling Iran the most active.
</P>
<P>
   The report said the Iranian government supported 13
assassinations of political opponents outside Iran last year. Most
were in northern Iraq. Iran reportedly hosted the representatives
of several terrorist groups last year.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the U.S. Congress have become increasingly concerned
about Iran's efforts to develop long-range missiles that, within a
decade, could reach even Germany.
</P>
<P>
   Congressional hard liners say that a country so rich in oil and
natural gas has no reason to build a nuclear reactor, which Iran is
doing, unless it wants to use it for developing nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the U.S. wants Iran to drop its opposition to the Oslo
peace process, meant to arrange a deal between Israel and the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   Iranian leaders object to the American ``accusations.''
</P>
<P>
   They deny seeking nuclear weapons and say that, while they
oppose the Oslo process, they will not interfere with it.
</P>
<P>
   The election of Iranian President Mohammad Khatami a year ago
has provided an opening. Though he is not the ultimate authority in
the Iranian government, he is popular and has expressed more
moderate views than Iran's other recent leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Khatami several months ago stated in a televised interview that
relations between the Iranian and American people need to improve.
President Bill Clinton has answered with his own vague wishes of
reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe we have to move away from the past mentality,''
Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister Javad Zarif said in an interview
recently. Otherwise, he warned, the chill between the two countries
could lead to a ``clash of civilizations . . . (which) would harm
everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   But, Zarif said any warmer relations will start on the level of
``civilizations,'' not governments.
</P>
<P>
   ``Very serious misunderstandings and misperceptions about Iran
exist in the United States,'' he said. He conceded that Iranians
harbor their own difficult ``political psychology'' against
America.
</P>
<P>
   (EDS: Optional add. Story can end here).
</P>
<P>
   So far, both sides accuse the other of being all talk.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they're not going to make any compromises, what's the point
in talking to them,'' asks Patrick Clawson, director of research at
the Washington Institute for Near East Studies.
</P>
<P>
   Some observers say the United States has to be wary of internal
Iranian politics. If America cozies up to Khatami too quickly, it
could cause a backlash against him from Iranian religious
hardliners.
</P>
<P>
   Clawson said the United States should not focus on Khatami, but
try to win over the Iranian people by giving them more access to
consumer goods.
</P>
<P>
   In Tehran these days, you can meet Iranians who say they have
agreements to represent U.S. companies if the embargo ends and,
recently, Italian intermediaries helped set up a tour of Midwestern
U.S. executives to Iran.
</P>
<P>
   But, it may be that tangible improvements cannot be made until
after a period of the symbolic, rhetorical, steps.
</P>
<P>
   John Woods, Iranian history expert at the University of Chicago,
said that Iranian culture dictates that enemies do not talk until
they formally reconcile and apologize. He suggests the U.S. start
by apologizing officially for shooting down the airliner in 1988.

   Commentary

<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND, Calif. _ The photos and text of ``The Forgotten
Holocaust'' exhibition at the Navy Library on Treasure Island could
nauseate viewers, but that is the point.
</P>
<P>
   The organizers wanted to drive home the view that unspeakable
atrocities, perpetrated by the Japanese military in Asia from 1931
to 1945, aren't all that well known in the West.
</P>
<P>
   One photo shows the severed head of a Chinese man displayed on a
roadblock outside Nanking. A cigarette butt was inserted into the
mouth by his killers.
</P>
<P>
   Chien Guei-Fa of Ning Po, a Chinese city, is looking skyward in
another photo. The caption says: ``Two o'clock in the afternoon of
Oct. 27, 1940, Japanese airplane flew in low altitude and dropped
flour and fleas in Kai Ming Street. He started having fever on Nov.
1. Lymph node on both of his thighs swollen. Fortunately, he
survived. But many people were not as lucky. Before they die they
had convulsion and their bodies turned black.''
</P>
<P>
   Testimony from Juanita Jamot, born Nov. 12, 1924: ``I want the
Japanese soldiers who raped me to repent. I want to recover my
dignity which was taken from me by the Japanese Army.''
</P>
<P>
   Each example represents the topics covered by the exhibition _
the rape of Nanking in which Japanese soldiers killed more than
300,000 Chinese; the workings of the Japanese biological and germ
warfare operation known as Unit 731; and ``comfort women,''
thousands of Asian women forced into prostitution by the Japanese
military.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, several hundred people viewed the exhibition, which
was unexpectedly extended. It was supposed to run from July 5 to
July 19. Because of strong demand _ more than 8,000 visitors in
that two-week period _ the exhibition will remain up for weekends
only through Sept. 27. There were calls to make the exhibition
permanent at the Treasure Island site.
</P>
<P>
   Local politicians, representatives of survivors' groups, and
scholars all said, in one way or another, that cruel and inhumane
acts of war must not be forgotten.
</P>
<P>
   Ignatius Y. Ding, an exhibition organizer with a Silicon Valley
group, Alliance for Preserving the Truth of Sino-Japanese War,
reiterated the old saying that those who don't learn from history
are condemned to repeat it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't learned anything in the past 50 years,'' Ding said.
``Look at Bosnia, Croatia, Somalia and Indonesia. We have to raise
the awareness of past atrocities. We have to show the younger
generation that justice will prevail and that good will triumph
over evil.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked whether the exhibition was one that targets Japan,
today an American ally, Ding said, ``This could happen to anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   But he quickly added, ``One reason we are bringing this out is
that the Japanese government continues to distort and deny
history.''
</P>
<P>
   A fourth-generation Japanese American, Ian Kawata, visiting the
exhibition with his Hong Kong-born woman friend, said Japanese
atrocities need to be remembered the way the Holocaust against the
Jews needs to be remembered.
</P>
<P>
   Kawata said he didn't feel self-conscious about the exhibition
targeting the homeland of his ancestors.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to make a clear distinction between Japanese and
Japanese Americans,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In an introductory statement, the exhibition organizers say,
``It should be emphasized that it's not our intention to stir up
hatred between the Chinese and Japanese. Hatred-induced vicious
cycles can only increase the suffering of these two peoples. We
believe that both the Japanese and Chinese were victims of the
Japanese militarists.''

SPIELBERG'S WAR OF INDEPENDENCE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(NOTE: The byline has been corrected) 
By BOB STRAUSS  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; Steven Spielberg loved his fantasies so much that
he made the world share them.
</P>
<P>
   Arguably the most talented member of the generation of film
directors that took over Hollywood in the 1970s, Spielberg was the
least interested in addressing reality in his work. And that made
him the most popular director in movie history.
</P>
<P>
   But after a decade of immersing himself _ and us _ in killer
sharks, benevolent aliens and whip-cracking pulp heroes, Spielberg
began casting his imaginative eye on more plausible, often
profoundly disturbing subjects. Beginning with the 1985 ``The Color
Purple,'' he balanced the derring-do and latter-day dinosaur rides
with increasingly complicated and demanding explorations into the
kinds of hard, historical truths that Hollywood, and especially the
Hollywood that Spielberg dominated, uses all its tricks to deny and
deflect our attention from.
</P>
<P>
   This approach resulted in one of the most beloved and admired
films of all time, the uncompromising Holocaust drama ``Schindler's
List.'' It's also given us ``Empire of the Sun'' and ``Amistad,''
both perceived as rare Spielberg failures but, in fact, rigorous
and probing examinations of what's emerging as the director's great
theme: the elusive, often contradictory and always costly struggle
for freedom.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps these films express a struggle within Spielberg, that of
a serious artist trying to emerge from the shadow of a consummate
showman. With his new film, ``Saving Private Ryan,'' a horrendously
graphic depiction of the D-Day landing and its brutalizing
aftermath, Spielberg may be digging for something deeper, though:
proving the adage the truth will set you free.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ryan'' is honestly ambiguous enough to be labeled many things.
But one of them is definitely Spielberg's declaration of
independence from his own enslavement to the Hollywood fantasies
that conquered his imagination as a child.
</P>
<P>
   ``My dad, who's 81 n/n 2 &QC; ught in the air force in Burma
in World War II,'' says Spielberg. ``He had reunions with his
fighter squad a lot, so, as a kid I had occasion to hear them
telling stories about what it was actually like _ stories that were
so different from the movies that Hollywood was showing me. I
didn't know who to believe, but I chose to believe the war movies
because my dad's stories were so outrageously harsh.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Then I realized that my dad had been telling the truth all
along and Hollywood had been fibbing about what it was like. For 50
years, most films about World War II have been sanitized. During
the war, the movies were almost what we would call a recruitment
tool, showing the honor and the glory of serving your country to
get a lot of young men to enlist. After the war, films glorified
our victories. They made audiences understand the sacrifices, too,
but in a way that was always very safe and wholly untrue.''
</P>
<P>
   Spielberg has set a number of films _ the Indiana Jones
adventures, the misfired comedy ``1941,'' ``Empire'' and
``Schindler's'' _ in the wartime and immediate pre-war eras. But
for his first real combat film, he vowed ``to acquit the veterans
and what they experienced, as opposed to using World War II as just
another springboard for an action-adventure movie.''
</P>
<P>
   Based on a fictional script by Robert Rodat, informed by
numerous veterans' accounts and by Stephen E. Ambrose's acclaimed
nonfiction books ``Citizen Soldiers,'' ``Band of Brothers'' and
``D-Day: June 6, 1944: The Climactic Battle of World War II,''
``Ryan'' set out to depict the chaos and horror of battle like no
movie ever had before.
</P>
<P>
   The 24-minute, Normandy landing sequence that opens the film,
for example, is an unflinching blood bath, a GI's scrambling view
of fire, blood, men being torn apart, deafening noise and
overwhelming fear.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew nothing, but I learned from the people who were
there,'' Spielberg notes. ``I thought Omaha Beach was a victory. I
thought Normandy was a victory; we got everybody on shore, after
all, and we began to push inland the next day. I didn't realize,
until I began reading Ambrose and talking to Omaha veterans, that
it was a chaotic disaster.''
</P>
<P>
   Though the German defenders put up their toughest fight against
the invaders at the Omaha landing site, by the end of June 6 all
five Normandy beaches had been secured. But it would be months
before Allied forces fought their way into the rest of France.
``Ryan'' regroups a few days after the landing, when a squad of
eight D-Day survivors led by Capt. Miller (Tom Hanks) is ordered
behind enemy lines to find a paratrooper, Matt Damon's Pvt. Ryan,
lost in the thoroughly botched, pre-invasion airdrop.
</P>
<P>
   His three brothers had been killed within the same week, so the
U.S. Command wants to send Ryan home intact to his grieving mother.
Providing he's still alive, or that the eight resentful men in
Miller's squad can find him before they're all killed.
</P>
<P>
   Although this main part of the movie explores the truly knotty
issues more associated with films about the Vietnam War than
America's idealized Good War, it's that bloodily realistic D-Day
sequence that has everybody talking.
</P>
<P>
   Is it too grisly for audience sensibilities conditioned by
decades of glamorized, as well as sanitized, movie violence? Should
it have earned the film an NC-17 rating, instead of the R it got?
Should the director-executive have been less graphic in the hope of
greater box-office acceptance _ especially since DreamWorks, the
mega-company he heads with Jeffrey Katzenberg and David Geffen, has
yet to enjoy the kind of blockbuster hits like ``Mask of Zorro,''
``Men in Black'' and ``The Lost World'' Spielberg still produces
for other studios?
</P>
<P>
   ``I have the freedom to make a movie like `Saving Private Ryan'
necessarily rough,'' he says, ``as opposed to having a studio boss
say, `Distill it and water it down like all those other World War
II movies, so maybe we can make a profit.' If I shoot myself in the
foot by making `Private Ryan' too much of a tough journey, at least
I made that choice. And that's what success allows you.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I really wanted to give the audience a physical experience,
not just a voyeuristic one. I did everything in my power to create
a visceral, honest look back at something that actually happened.
If the film had been rated NC-17, I would have accepted the rating
without protest. But I would not have cut the film.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I think there are people who will submit to the film. It's
a very potent cocktail, and people will be both shaken and stirred
by it. And if they give it a chance, there will be those who say,
`It's too real,' and there are others who will say, `I think it was
a very honest re-creation.'''
</P>
<P>
   Shot on a Normandy-like stretch of the Irish coast (with the
Irish army, as it did for ``Braveheart,'' supplying hundreds of
extras), the D-Day sequence was filmed during four six-day weeks,
more or less in the chronological continuity with which it unfolds
on screen.
</P>
<P>
   Always the consummate formal geniuses, Spielberg and his
director of photography, Janusz Kaminski, shot the whole thing with
handheld, unstabilized cameras from low angles, approximating the
``scared-of-getting-their-heads-shot-off'' perspective of real
combat photographers. Sixty percent of the footage's color
saturation then was drained out, giving the images a slightly
antique quality that somehwK enhances, rather than mutes, their
horror.
</P>
<P>
   When such artistry is put in the service of locating visual
truth, can the creator go back to the business of making really
convincing-looking velociraptors?
</P>
<P>
   ``I can always wear two hats, believe me,'' Spielberg says.
``I'm not a born-again sociologist with a camera. I love
entertainment, I understand how to do that kind of picture _ and
I'm learning how to do a picture like this.''
</P>
<P>
   And learning from it. While his commitment to more mindless fare
sounds solid, Spielberg also is nursing some serious doubts about
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're always going to make movies that are entertaining, and
that trade on violence for entertainment,'' he says. ``That's just
the reality of the industry. But you know, the problem these days _
and I am right in the middle of the culpability for this, so please
don't think I'm this holier-than-thou person giving a lecture _ is
that we've desensitized audiences through violence that is both
entertaining and creative.''
</P>
<P>
   And, it might be added, with movies that are simultaneously
stimulating, reassuring and manipulative in patently false ways.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a sense, I feel that `Schindler's List' and now `Saving
Private Ryan' can re-sensitize people to realistic experiences'' at
the movies, he says. ``They're not just saying, `You're going to be
safe voyeurs in this movie theater.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm asking a lot of the audience,'' he acknowledges, and in
that realization you can detect the risk and exhilaration that
always accompanies liberation. ``I'm asking them to participate in
the experience of those soldiers who had to do their jobs.''

   TIFFANY-EXHIBIT (New York) _ Austere is not the usual modifier
when it comes to Louis Comfort Tiffany. In the last two decades of
the 19th century, the interior decoration company carrying the name
of this painter-turned-designer defined the height of luxury for
wealthy, esthetically adventurous New Yorkers and set standards of
ostentatious propriety in churches across the country. But the
exhibition that the Metropolitan Museum of Art is devoting to this
leader of the Esthetic Movement, which forward-looking American
artists had imported from England by the 1870s, is startlingly
spare and understated. By Roberta Smith.

   MANHATTAN-FOREST (New York) _ As darkness falls, a burly man
lugging a boombox heads into Inwood Hill Park followed by a gaggle
of others. Your heart could sink at the prospect of Manhattan's
last stand of real forest, tucked away in the northwestern corner
of the borough, being desecrated by loud music. But hold on. The
fellow in front is Michael Feller, the parks department's senior
naturalist. He is leading a newly offered nocturnal tour of the
190-acre park. What happens next is, to say the least, not typical
of Manhattan night life.

`BILLY'S HOLLYWOOD SCREEN KISS': SWEETLY GOOFY 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Production notes at end of review.) 
(lh) 
 By STEPHEN HOLDEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   From the opening moments of ``Billy's Hollywood Screen Kiss,''
when the title character blithely chirps, ``I am a homosexual,''
it's clear that in its erotic nonchalance, this envelope-pushing
romantic comedy picks up several steps beyond where ``The Opposite
of Sex'' left off.
</P>
<P>
   The setting is West Hollywood, and the central character, Billy
Collier (Sean P. Hayes), is an ingenuous, slightly geeky-looking
young art photographer who rates himself a six on the Kinsey
one-to-six scale measuring homosexuality. Billy even jokes about
having inherited ``the show-tune gene.''
</P>
<P>
   If this sweetly goofy film, written and directed by Tommy
O'Haver, doesn't feature any famous show tunes, it might still be
described as a nonsinging musical comedy in which boy meets boy,
boy loses boy, and boy _ well, it would be unfair to give away the
bittersweet ending.
</P>
<P>
   Everything about the movie, except its realistic performances,
feels playfully surreal. When Billy recalls his youth, he displays
a series of witty candid snapshots that exist only in his mind. (He
couldn't have taken them, because he's in the photos.) Instead of a
traditional Broadway chorus line, the movie presents a mocking
Greek chorus of three comic drag queens lip-syncing the '60s hits
of Petula Clark. These gauzy musical baubles lend the movie the
same spirit of campy uplift that the hits of Mama Cass brought to
the film ``Beautiful Thing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Billy's Hollywood Screen Kiss'' is really about the way the
idealized romantic fantasies peddled by Hollywood in the 1940s and
'50s continue to exert an inordinate power over our lives. When
Billy first sees his 19-year-old dream lover, Gabriel (Brad Rowe),
in a West Hollywood coffeehouse, which suggests the late-'90s
equivalent of a corner soda shop in an Andy Hardy film, he is
instantly smitten.
</P>
<P>
   Gabriel, an aspiring musician who works as a waiter at the
coffeehouse, exudes the downy-cheeked glow of a shrink-wrapped boy
toy imported directly from the set of ``Baywatch.'' Although
Gabriel has left a girlfriend behind in San Francisco to pursue his
fortune in Los Angeles, he is unfazed by Billy's obvious romantic
interest. Their friendship reaches a crossroads in a suspenseful
scene in which they share a bed and Billy tremblingly makes his
move.
</P>
<P>
   Not just his romantic life but Billy's work revolves around
Hollywood fantasies. Encouraged by a mentor (Richard Ganoung) who
is as besotted with Billy as Billy is with Gabriel, he decides to
put together a photography show in which male couples recreate
famous Hollywood love scenes. For his first photo shoot, Billy
persuades Gabriel to re-enact with the former Warhol drag star
Holly Woodlawn the steamy surfside clinch of Burt Lancaster and
Deborah Kerr in ``From Here to Eternity.''
</P>
<P>
   The biggest failure of the movie is that it gets virtually no
comic mileage from the amusing notion of having drag queens
impersonate former film goddesses in classic love scenes.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Buoying the film are some sharply drawn minor characters.
Georgiana (Meredith Scott Lynn), a painter who is Billy's roommate,
doesn't think twice about sleeping with a jerk if he provides good
sex. When she and Billy descend on Catalina, where Gabriel has been
whisked off by a lecherous older photographer (Paul Bartel) to
appear in a fashion spread, she gamely endures the hilariously
stoned-out groans of a hippie sailor (Carmine Giovinazzo) who picks
up a guitar and serenades her with an excruciating love song he has
composed in honor of their one-night stand.
</P>
<P>
   It would be stretching a point to compare ``Billy's Hollywood
Screen Kiss'' with Shakespeare. But when most of the characters
converge on Catalina, this island where sexual chaos erupts begins
to resemble an up-to-the-minute West Coast composite of the dream
worlds of ``A Midsummer Night's Dream,'' ``The Tempest'' and
``Twelfth Night.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Billy's Hollywood Screen Kiss'' isn't at all deep. But in its
cheerful, fun-loving way, it reminds us that in our endlessly
self-referential, image-conscious pop culture, fantasy is what
makes the world go 'round.

ALL THAT JAZZ WITH LENO? JUST MUSIC TO HIS EARS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEN PARISH PERKINS 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BURBANK, Calif. _ Kevin Eubanks doesn't make many moves without
someone noticing. And this goes way back. When he began recording
for the instrumental-pop-oriented GRP Records in 1983, the jazz
press frowned, whining about an utter compromise of ``musical
integrity.''
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that Eubanks _ a fine guitarist whose 1988 album
``Shadow Prophets'' was Radio and Records' top contemporary jazz
album of the year _ has always found that a moralistic attitude
toward his art results in creative limitations he refuses to
accept.
</P>
<P>
   So you can imagine jazz purists dropping dead as word spread in
1992 that he had signed with Branford Marsalis to play in the house
band for the musically challenged ``Tonight Show'' with Jay Leno.
</P>
<P>
   Since taking over as music director for Marsalis three years
ago, Eubanks has become quite entrenched, a Hollywood player
unaware of his growing stature, but keenly knowledgeable of his
place in the center of the ongoing debate about musicians and
soul-selling. The 40-year-old Eubanks has found a fluid, creative
relationship with the host of a bland, middle-of-the-road talk
show, a guy who relies on their exchanges to keep the show's flow
steady and the proceedings cheery.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most persistent questions Eubanks fields these days
isn't whether he has sold out, but how he could possibly remain
creative while anchored to a daily network television gi  &QC; here
comedic chit-chat is required.
</P>
<P>
   This is senseless to Eubanks, because playing in front of
millions nightly, backing everyone from Garth Brooks to Luther
Vandross, doesn't change anything about his music. In fact, he
feels it merely broadens his range, expands his awareness and
creates even more opportunities to enjoy his kind of music.
</P>
<P>
   But, he says, with a shrug of the shoulders, ``You know, people
will always say something no matter what you do.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite hanging with Leno weekdays, Eubanks spends some weekends
on the road _ he just returned from Portland, Ore., and heads to
Nashville, Tenn., next month. And the ``Tonight Show'' connection
has given him and his band members the kind of exposure many
musicians would kill for.
</P>
<P>
   Just the other night, the band's saxophonist, Ralph Moore;
drummer, Marvin ``Smitty'' Smith; and bassist, Bob Hurst, kicked it
at Club Brasserie in the Bel Age Hotel. Judging by what was played
(tunes from John Coltrane and Benny Golson, to name two) and the
audience's approval, this crowd wasn't made up of heartland
tourists lured by a TV star.
</P>
<P>
   ``You get on something like Leno and all of a sudden you're no
longer the stereotypical starving musician dying for his art,''
Eubanks says. ``There's the perception that you have just kind of
forgotten about the music you've loved all your life. Does that
make any sense?''
</P>
<P>
   Eubanks didn't hesitate to replace Marsalis, even amid rumors
that Marsalis was feeling creatively bankrupt and could no longer
stomach the shot-the-breeze chats with Leno. Where Marsalis felt
uneasy, Eubanks feels at ease, even when inserted into scripted
comedy skits or unscripted banter.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really just a matter of developing a feel for your place
on the show, and that's to go back and forth with Jay,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not an actor,'' Eubanks says. ``I just say things that
come to my head. It works. The more you get to know somebody the
easier it is to talk. You don't have to think of anything to say.
It just comes.''
</P>
<P>
   Eubanks grew up in Philadelphia but has spent most of his adult
life in New York be-bop clubs. He sold lots of records in the '80s
and signed on with Blue Note Records in the early '90s, teaming
with bassists like Dave Holland. And living in Los Angeles, Eubanks
still makes time to write, rehearse or simply jam with the horde of
migrated New York musicians.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not taking anything away from the musicians here, but the
LA thing is more of a presentation,'' he says. ``New York is kind
of what it is; LA is kind of what it ``looks'' like.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me, it doesn't matter how much you're on TV, how many
movies you're on or whatever you do. It's not going to help you
play better. It's not going to help you get to the next chord or
write that next song. That comes from rehearsal, gigs,
dedication.''

`PRIVATE RYAN' IS POWERFUL, SHATTERING EXPERIENCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WILLIAM ARNOLD  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   I might as well say this straight off: Steven Spielberg's
near-three-hour ``Saving Private Ryan'' is quite simply one of the
most powerful war movies ever made, and a shattering emotional
experience. Be warned: this one is not for the faint of heart.
</P>
<P>
   Contrary to earlier reports, it's not exactly an anti-war film.
Though it plays with a central incongruity and makes us want to get
as far away from war as possible, it believes in the crusade
against Hitler, and displays little of the irony or ambivalence of
its reputed model, David Lean's ``The Bridge on the River Kwai.''
</P>
<P>
   It's essentially a combat film: a gritty, harrowingly authentic
account of what it must have been like to be a dogface in the midst
of America's bloodiest war _ so real and immediate and unrelenting
that it creates much of the same kind of battle stress in its
audience that the real participants must have felt.
</P>
<P>
   The film opens with a devastating, 30-minute sequence of the
D-Day landing on Omaha Beach during World War II: a sequence shot
mostly in a jumpy, handheld-camera style, but that is so skillful
and so progressively unsettling that it soon wipes away our memory
of ``The Longest Day,'' ``Platoon,'' and just about every other war
movie ever made. It puts us in a different psychological place
altogether.
</P>
<P>
   The script then settles into its premise: a story about a
special mission given a veteran Army captain (Tom Hanks) to find a
certain Private Ryan (Matt Damon) whose three brothers have been
killed in combat that same week and who General George Marshall
(Harve Presnell) personally wants to get back to his mother in
Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   The captain gathers a squad of men, and the rest of the film
follows their episodic journey deep into France as they look for
the illusive title character who parachuted behind enemy lines on
D-Day _ culminating in yet another extended battle sequence in a
French village that is almost as horrifying as the opening scenes.
</P>
<P>
   In the same way he managed to find an upbeat message in the
Holocaust (``Schindler's List'') and the shame of American Slavery,
(``Amistad'') Spielberg's message here is a positive one. As futile
and even absurd as it may seem to risk the lives of eight men to
``rescue'' a man who might already be dead, Spielberg sees the
mission as one of nobility _ the kind of nobility of spirit that
differentiated us from our enemy in that conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Yet it's so hyper-realistic for such a long period of screen
time, and the audience goes (literally, I'll wager) into such a
state of shock, that this message falls a bit flat. It's hard to
feel anything but primal fear, and hard to even notice the subtle
theme, the innovative camerawork of Janusz Kaminski and the fine,
understated performances of Hanks, Damon, Tom Sizemore and the rest
of the cast.
</P>
<P>
   It's not just the gore either _ the arms blown off, the heads
removed from bodies before our eyes, the faces reduced to
hamburger. We've seen all this before. The horror of the film is
more in the way it conveys a sense of utter helplessness, the
perverse element of chance at work and the sheer magnitude and
impersonality of the slaughter. Combat on film never has seemed so
agonizingly unappealing.
</P>
<P>
   How then do you classify such an experience? Art? Entertainment?
An epic adventure? To be accurate, it's none of the above. Nor is
it a thriller, a character piece, or a penetrating study of men in
war. Despite the presence of mega-star Hanks in the lead, he's so
constrained and understated it's not even a star vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   The film is more properly a ``trip'' movie, a Spielbergian
theme-park ride that induCe$Y[W-91

MAFIA!: HERE'S AN OFFER YOU SHOULD REFUSE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WILLIAM ARNOLD  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   On paper, the idea of an ``Airplane!''-like parody of classic
gangster movies sounds great _ especially with ``Airplane!''
co-director Jim Abrahams on board as writer-producer.
</P>
<P>
   But in execution, ``Mafia!'' (titled ``Jane Austen's Mafia''
until minutes before release) is tedious, only sporadically funny
and distasteful in a way its predecessors in the genre (``Naked
Gun,'' ``Top Secret!'') were not.
</P>
<P>
   Worse, the strain of humor it mines has been so played out over
the past 18 years since ``Airplane!'' that Abrahams has started
recycling his own sight gags from earlier movies.
</P>
<P>
   The film is a spoof of both the first two ``Godfather'' movies
and ``Casino'' _ lampooning their more famous scenes as it weaves
back and forth in time and chronicles the saga of the ``Cortino''
crime family over nearly a century.
</P>
<P>
   It's mercifully short (86 minutes) and the cast does its best
(especially Seattle actor Billy Burke as the Sonny Corleone
figure), but the film never finds the line of satire or the
character focus that might hold it together as a feature film.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the earlier Abrahams' parodies _ which each attack a wide
genre of film _ this one also makes burlesque very specific films,
two of them masterpieces. So if you don't know the films by heart,
much of the humor will pass you by. And if you do love the films,
their trashing seems an unnecessary and clumsy sacrilege.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, apparently to broaden the demographics and
pander to the kid audience that won't get the ``Godfather'' gags,
Abrahams' humor goes lower that ever before, with more flatulence,
scatalogical and gross-out jokes than even Eddie Murphy's ``The
Nutty Professor.''
</P>
<P>
   The usual scatter-gun, Mad Magazine-style jokes _ sight gags,
visual absurdities, unlikely guest star cameos (Alex Trebek as
himself in turn-of-the-century Sicily) _ also are present in force,
but they're mostly redundant and stale. Abrahams' heart doesn't
seem to be in this.
</P>
<P>
   If you're a movie fan, the casting of Lloyd Bridges also doesn't
help the film. Seeing the veteran actor looking so decrepit and so
undignified _ and knowing he died last March _ somehow gives
``Mafia!'' an overcast of sadness that, for me, was finally just
smothering.
</P>
<P>
   Mafia! Directed by Jim Abrahams. Written by Jim Abrahams, Greg
Norberg and Michael McManus. Cast: Lloyd Bridges, Jay Mohr, Billy
Burke, Christina Applegate. Disney/Touchstone. 86 minutes. Rated
PG-13 for gross humor.
</P>
<P>
   Grade: D

`SAVING PRIVATE RYAN': A SOBERLY MAGNIFICENT NEW WAR FILM 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Production notes at end of review.) 
(lh) 
 By JANET MASLIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When soldiers are killed in ``Saving Private Ryan,'' their
comrades carefully preserve any message he left behind. Removed
from the corpses of the newly dead, sometimes copied over to hide
bloodstains, these writings surely describe some of the fury of
combat, the essence of spontaneous courage, the craving for solace,
the bizarre routines of wartime existence, the deep loneliness of
life on the brink.
</P>
<P>
   Steven Spielberg's soberly magnificent new war film, the second
such pinnacle in a career of magical versatility, has been made in
the same spirit of urgent communication. It is the ultimate
devastating letter home.
</P>
<P>
   Since the end of World War II and the virtual death of the
western, the combat film has disintegrated into a showcase for
swagger, cynicism, obscenely overblown violence and hollow,
self-serving victories. Now, with stunning efficacy, Spielberg
turns back the clock. He restores passion and meaning to the genre
with such whirlwind force that he seems to reimagine it entirely,
dazzling with the breadth and intensity of that imagination. No
received notions, dramatic or ideological, intrude on this
achievement. This film simply looks at war as if war had not been
looked at before.
</P>
<P>
   Though the experience it recounts is grueling, the viscerally
enthralling ``Saving Private Ryan'' is anything but. As he did in
``Schindler's List,'' Spielberg uses his preternatural storytelling
gifts to personalize the unimaginable, to create instantly
empathetic characters and to hold an audience spellbound from the
moment the action starts. Though the film essentially begins and
ends with staggering, phenomenally agile battle sequences and
contains isolated violent tragedies in between, its vision of
combat is never allowed to grow numbing. Like the soldiers, viewers
are made furiously alive to each new crisis and never free to rest.
</P>
<P>
   The film's immense dignity is its signal characteristic, and
some of it is achieved though deliberate elision. We don't know
anything about these men as they prepare to land at Omaha Beach on
D-Day, which might make them featureless in the hands of a less
intuitive filmmaker. Here, it means that any filter between
audience and cataclysm has effectively been taken away.
</P>
<P>
   The one glimmer of auxiliary information is the image of an
elderly visitor at a military cemetery, which opens and closes the
film (though these brief sequences lack the film's otherwise
shattering verisimilitude). Whoever the man is, he sees the
gravestones and drifts into D-Day memories. On the evidence of what
follows, he can hardly have gone to sleep since June 6, 1944,
without reliving these horrors in his dreams.
</P>
<P>
   Though ``Saving Private Ryan'' is liable to be described as
extremely violent for its battle re-enactments, that is not quite
the case. The battle scenes avoid conventional suspense and
sensationalism; they disturb not by being manipulative but by being
hellishly frank. Imagine Hieronymus Bosch with a Steadicam (instead
of the immensely talented Janusz Kaminski), and you have some idea
of the tableaux to emerge here, as the film explodes into panoramic
yet intimate visions of bloodshed.
</P>
<P>
   What's unusual about this, in both the D-Day sequence and the
closing struggle, is its terrifying reportorial candor. These
scenes have a sensory fullness (the soundtrack is boomingly chaotic
yet astonishingly detailed), a realistic yet breakneck pace, a
ceaseless momentum and a vast visual scope. Artful, tumultuous
warfare choreography heightens the intensity. So do editing
decisions that balance the ordeal of the individual with the mass
attack under way.
</P>
<P>
   So somehow we are everywhere: aboard landing craft in the throes
of anticipatory jitters; underwater where bullets kill
near-silently and men drown under the weight of heavy equipment; on
the shore with the man who flies upward in an explosion and then
comes down minus a leg; moving inland with the Red Cross and the
priest and the sharpshooter; reaching a target with the savagely
vengeful troops who firebomb a German bunker and let the men burn.
Most of all, we are with Capt. John Miller (Tom Hanks) in heights
of furious courage and then, suddenly, in an epiphany of
shellshocked confusion. Never have Hanks' everyman qualities been
more instantly effective than here.
</P>
<P>
   When the battle finally ends, there are other unfamiliar sights,
like the body of a soldier named Ryan washed up on the beach amid
fish. (The film's bloody authenticity does not allow false majesty
for the dead.) Next we are drawn into the incongruously small-scale
drama of the Ryan family, with three sons killed and only one
remaining, lost somewhere in Normandy. Miller and his unit, played
with seamless ensemble spirit by actors whose pre-production
boot-camp experience really shows here, are sent to find what the
captain calls ``a needle in a stack of needles'' and bring him home
alive.
</P>
<P>
   In another beautifully choreographed sequence, shot with obvious
freshness and alacrity, the soldiers talk while marching though the
French countryside. On the way, they establish strong individual
identities and raise the film's underlying questions about the
meaning of sacrifice. Spielberg and screenwriter Robert Rodat have
a way of taking these standard-issue characters and making them
unaccountably compelling.
</P>
<P>
   Some of that can also be ascribed to the fine, indie-bred cast
that includes Edward Burns (whose acting prospects match his
directing talents) as the wise guy from Brooklyn; Tom Sizemore as
the rock-solid second in command; Giovanni Ribisi as the thoughtful
medic; Barry Pepper as the devout Southern sharpshooter; Jeremy
Davies as the timid, desperately inadequate intellectual; Vin
Diesel as the tough Italian, and Adam Goldberg as the tough Jew.
</P>
<P>
   As the actors spar (coolly, with a merciful lack of glibness),
the film creates a strong sense of just how different they are and
just how strange it is for each man to find himself in this
crucible. Yet ``Saving Private Ryan,'' unlike even the best films
about the mind-bending disorientation of the Vietnam War, does not
openly challenge the moral necessity of their being forced to
fight. With a wonderfully all-embracing vision, it allows for
patriotism, abject panic and everything in between. The soldiers'
decisions are never made easily, and sometimes they are fatally
wrong. In this uncertainty, too, ``Saving Private Ryan'' tells an
unexpected truth.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The film divides gracefully into a string of well-defined
sequences that lead inexorably to Ryan. Inevitably, audiences will
know that he is played by Matt Damon and thus will be found alive.
But the film still manages to create considerable suspense about
when and how he will appear. When it finally comes, Damon's
entrance is one more tribute to Spielberg's ingenious staging,
catching the viewer utterly off-guard. There's the same effect to
Ryan's impassioned reaction, in one of many scenes that prompt deep
emotion, to the news that he can go home.
</P>
<P>
   Though ``Saving Private Ryan'' features Hollywood's most durable
contemporary star in its leading role, there's nothing stellar
about the way Hanks gives the film such substance and pride. As in
``Apollo 13,'' his is a modest, taciturn brand of heroism, and it
takes on entirely new shadings here. In Miller, the film finds a
plain yet gratifying complex focus, a decent, strong, fallible man
who sustains his courage while privately confounded by the extent
that war has now shaped him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Back home, I'd tell people what I do, they'd say, `It
figures,''' he explains to his men after an especially troubling
encounter. ``But over here, it's a big mystery, judging from the
looks on your faces. I guess that means I've changed over here. I
wonder sometimes if my wife is even going to recognize me, whenever
it is I'm going to get back to her. And how I can possibly tell her
about days like today.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the many epiphanies in ``Saving Private Ryan'' are some
especially unforgettable ones: the anguished ordeal of Davies' map
maker and translator in a staircase in the midst of battle; the
tranquil pause in a bombed-out French village, to the strains of
Edith Piaf; the brisk way the soldiers sift through a pile of dog
tags, momentarily forgetting that each one signifies a death. A man
driving a tank looks up for a split second before a Molotov
cocktail falls on him. Two of the film's principals huddle against
sandbags at a critical juncture; and then, suddenly, only one is
still breathing.
</P>
<P>
   The sparing use of John Williams' music sustains the tension in
scenes, like these, that need no extra emphasis. But ``Saving
Private Ryan'' does have a very few false notes. Like the cemetery
scenes, the capture of a German soldier takes a turn for the
artificial, especially when the man expresses his desperation
through broad clowning. But in context, such a jarring touch is
actually a relief. It's a reminder that, after all, ``Saving
Private Ryan'' is only a movie. Only the finest war movie of our
time.

DESPITE SUDDEN FAME, DAMON STAYS FOCUSED _ EVEN AT WORK WITH HERO
SPIELBERG
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ELVIS MITCHELL 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``How the hell,'' asks Stephen Ambrose, ``does Matt Damon handle
it?''
</P>
<P>
   The tough, outspoken historian and author of several books,
including ``Citizen Soldiers,'' which is the spiritual basis for
much of ``Saving Private Ryan'' scratches his head about the nature
of celebrity. The man he wonders about _ and likes _ is nonplused
by it as well. ``I gotta tell you, man,'' Damon says, surrounded by
a pile of cigarette debris and looking slightly embarrassed. ``It
is totally surreal.''
</P>
<P>
   Damon could be discussing the World War II epic ``Saving Private
Ryan,'' in which he has a slim, but key, role. Instead, the
27-year-old actor is talking about the fame that has enveloped him
since last winter's ``Good Will Hunting.'' Damon's life has gone
from staid to turbulent. Every date _ especially those with
ex-flame Minnie Driver _ every meal, every public moment has become
the subject of tabloid scrutiny. But that hasn't stopped him from
concentrating on his work.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's completely odd, because I am totally the same guy. So to
walk into a room six months ago and not turn any heads. And now
...'' His voice trails off as he watches the cigarette smoke curl
up lazily from the ashtray. ``For me, it's just a clear
demonstration of how powerful the medium is. It has nothing to do
with me, or my work, in a lot of ways. I mean, `Good Will Hunting'
was the first thing I'd been in that people saw. I've been in huge
bombs.''
</P>
<P>
   One of those was 1993's ``Geronimo: An American Legend,'' in
which he played a part that bears some similarities to the
character he plays in ``Ryan.'' Damon was Britton Davis, the
good-natured observer who bore witness to the U.S. Army's shameful
treatment of Geronimo and his tribe. In ``Ryan,'' he's the man who
has to be brought home to his family after his brothers are killed
in action.
</P>
<P>
   ``Davis had such decency. In reading his book, he was such an
impressive guy. And Ryan is a symbol for everybody's brother,
everybody's chance to go home. They are both similar in a lot of
ways. They're both symbols of America's future. And they're both
catalysts, each carrying his own sense of guilt into the future.''
</P>
<P>
   By guilt, Damon means that Ryan has a lot to live up to, seeing
the men come to take him home. ``Well,'' he says, lighting up, ``we
catch him at the most critical time in his life, when he hears the
worst news he could possibly hear. So the decision he makes _ not
wanting to go home _ makes a lot of sense to me. I'm not sure if I
could make that choice. I would think that, if it were me, I'd go
running home to my mom after having seen what he saw. But at the
same time, it was a different era, people were different. And the
news he got could get your hackles up enough to make you do just
about anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Ryan's willfulness isn't that far from Will Hunting's tenacity.
It makes one wonder whether Damon is attracted to characters with a
hot self-destructive streak.
</P>
<P>
   ``Probably,'' he blurts out, laughing. ``That self-destructive
thing, it's a very dramatic impulse. In `Good Will Hunting,' that
impulse set the action in motion. If it wasn't about a guy who was
going out and drinking all night and beating people to within an
inch of their lives, it wouldn't be much of a story. Instead, it'd
be about a guy who's gone to get a job at Raytheon. What kind of
movie is that?''
</P>
<P>
   He smiles. ``I guess you could say the same for Davis in
`Geronimo.' In writing the book about the campaign, he sacrifices
his future _ his standing, perhaps _ for the truth. But it's
interesting when people are being true to themselves and following
the road that can lead to self-destruction.''
</P>
<P>
   Damon also played a character who fell apart under war, in
``Courage Under Fire,'' and whose life afterward also led to a kind
of self-immolation.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what that character was to me. I wanted to show a man
who was completely ravaged by what had happened to him, decisions
he had made _ to be active or not active _ in a split second.''
</P>
<P>
   There was no self-destructive impulse about Damon's signing on
to work with legendary director Steven Spielberg. ``I knew,'' he
says, ``that this was gonna be the chance of a lifetime. What I
found was that he was really accessible. Because all the young guys
in the audience, they're all filmmakers _ writers and directors.
And Steven was attracted to that. I think he sees himself in that.
He took the time to tutor us. Believe me, I asked him every single
question you could ask. He was totally enthusiastic, and I was just
a scrub on the set.''
</P>
<P>
   His mounting enthusiasm in discussing Spielberg's command
explodes upon discussion of a specific scene in which one actor
runs from a battle site to the top floor of a chateau. The scene
was captured in a single shot.
</P>
<P>
   Damon stands and shouts gleefully. ``Oh, my God. I couldn't
believe it. It's insane. How does somebody even think of something
like that? It's ridiculous. I'm tellin' everybody about this shot,
man, because I was right next to him when he did it. And it wasn't
planned! He just decided to do it, and it only took half a day. And
he never loses the story. That's where young directors trying all
of this flashy stuff fail. Because they make the mistake of just
trying to show off. To be next to him when he's making those
decisions, with total confidence, that would have me hemming and
hawing for years!''
</P>
<P>
   He slumps back into his chair and shakes his head, unable to
dislodge the grin from his face. ``I don't think anybody should be
that confident. I said to him, `What were you thinking, not
storyboarding this movie?' And (Spielberg) said, `It's the
adrenaline rush!'''
</P>
<P>
   Damon's next picture picks up the thread of self-damage; in
``Rounders'' set for release this fall, he and Edward Norton play a
pair of compulsive gamblers. But the movie he's about to start
shooting is the story of a man who both damages himself and turns
it back on others. He's starring in Anthony Minghella's (''The
English Patient'') adaptation of Patricia Highsmith's ``The
Talented Mr. Ripley.''
</P>
<P>
   He has trimmed down for the role; he's barely bigger than one of
the cigarettes he's chain-smoking. ``I'm heading off to Italy to do
it. Y'know, it's got this great obsession of unobtainable love and
this guy who destroys everything that he does love,'' he says,
chuckling, with a glint in his eye that couldn't be further from
Tom Ripley's amoral manipulation.
</P>
<P>
   ``What can I say?'' Damon says, laughing abashedly and hissing a
plume of smoke. ``It's an embarrassment of riches.''

DISK-DRIVE MAKER OUSTS ITS LEADER IN SUDDEN SHAKEUP 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Most executives ``leave to pursue other
interests,'' retire or invoke some other catch phrases to mask a
sacking by the board of directors.
</P>
<P>
   But Seagate Technology Inc.'s flamboyant founder and chief
executive, Al Shugart, was just plain, outright fired by the
world's largest computer disk-drive maker.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement released Tuesday, the Scotts Valley, Calif.-based
company announced that Shugart was ``leaving Seagate at the request
of the company's board of directors.''
</P>
<P>
   ``(T)he time had come to make a change in the leadership of the
company,'' Seagate said in the announcement. Shugart was replaced
by Seagate president and chief operating officer, Stephen Luczo.
</P>
<P>
   But Shugart refuses to go quietly. Not surprising, considering
the executive's bombastic past.
</P>
<P>
   While leading Seagate, the 67-year-old Shugart has been the
flamboyant point man on initiatives limiting lawyer contingency
fees and shareholder lawsuits, and helped head a failed push for
no-fault auto insurance.
</P>
<P>
   Shugart said the ouster was unexpected.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I was doing a really good job,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't get anything out of them. They said it was time for
a leadership change. You won't resign. So you're fired. I was
contacted by the company's outside board members on Saturday. On
Sunday we had a telephone board meeting, and I was fired,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Shugart said, however, that he remains a member of the company's
board of directors.

TO HELP INVESTORS, 250 CORPORATIONS ARE EVALUATED ON SOCIAL ISSUES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TERESA McUSIC 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Being a socially responsible investor isn't as easy as it may
sound.
</P>
<P>
   Just ask the Texas State Board of Education.
</P>
<P>
   The board voted recently to sell its $46 million worth of Walt
Disney Co. stock after viewing violent and sexually explicit clips
from films made by Miramax Films, a Disney subsidiary.
</P>
<P>
   But was it the children's school money going to unseemly films
that sparked that decision, or the pressure from the year-old
national boycott of Disney by the Southern Baptism Convention over
Disney giving benefits to gay and lesbian domestic partners.
</P>
<P>
   And what about other Disney issues. Sure, they just built this
great zoo theme park in Florida that creates hundreds of acres of
natural habitat for its animals, but isn't this the same company
that was stopped by the Environmental Protection Agency, historians
and other groups from trying to build a theme park on historic
grounds in Virginia?
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the National Hispanic Media Coalition has also called
for a Disney boycott over its record of hiring Latinos.
International labor groups have called for a boycott of its toys
made in China, Haiti and Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   But let's also look at some of the other holdings of the Texas
board's portfolio, such as Harrah's Entertainment and
Anheuser-Busch Cos. Could those investments be deemed inappropriate
as well?
</P>
<P>
   Such is the brave new world of one of the hottest and most
controversial investment trends today: socially responsible
investing.
</P>
<P>
   This trend is skyrocketing. In 1997, $1.2 trillion in assets in
the United States were in what was deemed socially and
environmentally responsible portfolios, up a whopping 85 percent
from 1995, according to a Social Investment Forum study.
</P>
<P>
   A new book chronicles the trend and provides information and
ratings on 250 major corporations.
</P>
<P>
   It's called ``The Corporate Report Card: Rating 250 of America's
Corporations for the Socially Responsible Investor'' (Dutton, 260
pages, $24.95).
</P>
<P>
   Nearly $1 out of every $10 invested in U.S. stocks is socially
managed, either through screening, voting proxies or filing of
shareholder resolutions, according to the book, which was written
by the staff members of the Council on Economic Priorities.
</P>
<P>
   ``This growing phenomenon illustrates that investors are
increasingly showing a preference for well managed companies that
operate on principles of long-term profitability inextricably
linked to social responsibility,'' CEP says.
</P>
<P>
   The council, formed in 1969 in New York City, has been active in
developing several programs to not only provide information and
ratings on corporations to investors, but also to use its
information to influence the corporations.
</P>
<P>
   For example, CEP's studies have provided the pressure needed to
improve the pulp and paper industries, as well as other major
polluters. Also, the council's Campaign for Cleaner Corporations
program has identified 23 corporate polluters, and each of the
companies has discussed its performance with CEP, negotiated change
and made improvements.
</P>
<P>
   CEP also awards companies with corporate conscience awards for
such issues as charitable contributions, community involvement,
equal employment opportunity, family concerns, global ethics,
animal rights and education.
</P>
<P>
   Now, CEP offers a book that evaluates 250 corporations on such
issues as the environment, woman and minority advancement,
charitable giving, community outreach, family benefits, workplace
issues and social disclosure. Along with a grade from ``A'' to
``F'' ranking these issues, CEP provides a short analysis
discussing recent court cases, Occupational Safety and Health
Administration action, corporate policies and other records.
</P>
<P>
   Therein lies information that may muddy the waters of investor
decisions rather than clarify. For example, CEP gives Exxon an
``A'' rating on the environment, then proceeds to tell readers that
the company's average toxic releases have increased a sixth
annually, ``one of the worst performance within the industry
sample.''
</P>
<P>
   In another entry, Nike was given an ``A'' with a question mark
for workplace issues (the question mark indicates the grade is
based only on partial information.) But in the notes entry, CEP
says that in West Java, where the majority of Nike shoes are made,
most workers earned Java's minimum wage, were subjected to forced
overtime, punished for taking sick leave and lacked decent drinking
water on site.
</P>
<P>
   Still, taken on its whole, especially reading the company notes,
the book can provide investors with a great deal of information on
socially related issues.
</P>
<P>
   Then, it's up to the investor to make the tough decisions.
</P>

`EAST PALACE, WEST PALACE': POWERFUL DRAMA AND COURAGEOUS
POLITICS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By LAWRENCE VAN GELDER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Were it just that this is an independent film from China, where
the government has long intruded on the production and release of
motion pictures, ``East Palace, West Palace'' would be noteworthy.
</P>
<P>
   But this film, directed by Zhang Yuan, has more than rarity to
recommend it.
</P>
<P>
   Superficially the story of the interrogation of a young
homosexual man taken into custody by a police officer in a roundup
of gay men in a park adjacent to the Forbidden Palace in Beijing,
the film can also be perceived as a tense love story, a cogent
argument for gay rights and a forceful appeal for a government
benign, liberal and wise enough to embrace dissidence.
</P>
<P>
   Focused almost entirely on the nightlong interrogation of the
young gay man, A-Lan (played by Si Han), by the police officer,
Xiao Shi (Hu Jun), ``East Palace, West Palace'' is also a
splendidly acted film that, thanks to the skills of Zhang, never
seems stagey or confined.
</P>
<P>
   As Xiao Shi, clearly conflicted about his own sexual yearnings,
presses A-Lan for an accounting of his behavior, the film flashes
back to A-Lan's childhood, to his sexual encounters as an adult and
to fantasies that carry messages of love, mercy and the
compassionate exercise of power.
</P>
<P>
   Although nothing of the police officer's past is revealed, the
feminine-looking A-Lan, who has known since childhood that he was
gay, tells Xiao Shi that he is a man who has been sent away for
cures that never worked, that he is a married man and a writer of
complicated love stories. And surely ``East Palace, West Palace,''
encompassing the relationship of the two men and the relationship
of the governed to government, is a complicated love story.
</P>
<P>
   More than once, as he recoils from his own attraction to A-Lan,
Xiao Shi shouts, ``You're despicable,'' or, ``You're sick.'' And
A-Lan, who at no time retreats from his self-knowledge and
self-acceptance for all the pain and difficulty it might bring him,
typically replies, ``No, I'm gay.''
</P>
<P>
   In ``East Palace, West Palace,'' which takes its title from the
public toilets that flank the Forbidden Palace and where gay men
cruise, Zhang mingles powerful drama and courageous politics.

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ As darkness falls, a burly man lugging a boom box
heads into Inwood Hill Park followed by a group of others. Your
heart could sink at the prospect of Manhattan's last stand of real
forest, tucked away in the northwestern corner of the borough,
being desecrated by loud music. But hold on. The fellow in front is
Michael Feller, the Parks Department's senior naturalist. He is
leading a nocturnal tour of the 190-acre park. What happens next
is, to say the least, not typical of Manhattan night life.
</P>
<P>
   Feller's group hikes into the narrow valley called the Clove. It
is dominated by tulip trees soaring to 100 feet, their high canopy
shattering the starlight. This kind of verticality could be
confused with a redwood grove of the Northwest. Feller flicks on
the boom box. It's now 9:20 p.m. Out of the tape drive comes a
high, arching whinny, pure and sweet. If a mare could sing Puccini,
this would be its voice. Feller turns off the boom box. The group
waits and listens.
</P>
<P>
   At first, there is only the layered, sotto voce drumming of
crickets and cicadas. Then, from the high ground to the west, comes
what at first sounds like a distant echo. He replays the tape
several times. The answering whinny comes closer. Suddenly, a pair
of ash-gray wings swoops low over the group, swift and silent. It's
a screech owl, ready to challenge the electronic trespasser on its
hunting territory.
</P>
<P>
   Another screech owl makes a sortie so low over Feller that he
instinctively rubs the back of his neck. ``He's ticked off at us,''
he says. Moments later, a third owl appears on the branch of an
oak. Its eyes, caught in the beam of Feller's head-mounted
flashlight, are golden yellow and hard as marbles.
</P>
<P>
   No other Manhattan park is known to play host to a family of
screech owls. Neither is any other park in the borough quite like
Inwood Hill. The others are distinctly urban places. Their beauty,
even when they are verdant, may have been enabled or enhanced by
artifice and engineering.
</P>
<P>
   At Bethesda Fountain in Central Park, or on the overlooks of
Fort Tryon Park, you always know you're in the city. Trekking over
the slopes of Inwood Hill Park, though, you are simply in the
woods.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could define this as Manhattan's wilderness,'' Parks
Commissioner Henry Stern said one morning, sitting on a bench under
a sweet gum tree at the Isham Street entrance to the park. ``It's
also the park that nobody knows.''
</P>
<P>
   Stern grew up a few blocks away in the Inwood section, on Post
Avenue. His father, a Boy Scout enthusiast, owned a tent store in
the neighborhood on Nagle Avenue. Stern said one of his earliest
memories was of playing at the Beak Street entrance to the park,
while his mother sat with other mothers and chatted. Running just
300 feet from Seaman Avenue before dead-ending in the park, Beak
Street is the borough's shortest mapped street above Canal Street.
Aficionados of intact Art Deco apartment houses will love Beak
Street, along with dozens of others in Inwood.
</P>
<P>
   In his most feeling tribute to his boyhood days spent in Inwood
Park, Stern said gratefully: ``I never got beat up here. This was
not a fighting park. Neither the Jets nor the Sharks would have
been comfortable in Inwood Park.''
</P>
<P>
   There is nothing scrubby about Inwood Hill's forest, which makes
it easy to mistake it for virgin growth. But most of the timber
there was cut down during the Revolutionary War by British troops
and Hessian mercenaries who used it for firewood and fortification.
They had driven Colonial forces from this strategic spot, as well
as from Fort Tryon to the south, on Nov. 16, 1776. They did not
leave until 1783.
</P>
<P>
   After the Civil War, several great estates were built on Inwood
Hill, including an Italian-style villa belonging to Isidore Straus,
the retail tycoon who went down on the Titanic. The Refuge of
Mercy, an Episcopal home for unwed mothers, was also built on the
crest of the hill, overlooking the Hudson River. It was,
presumably, suitably removed from the rest of the city to give the
young women privacy. Ornamental trees planted then still flourish.
</P>
<P>
   Park designer Frederick Law Olmsted, recognizing the value of
this terrain, recommended that development be restrained.
Public-spirited landowners, notably the Dyckman, Isham and Payson
families, deeded large tracts to the city. In 1916, Inwood Hill
became a public park.
</P>
<P>
   The most dramatic approach to the park is from the north, along
218th Street, a five-minute walk from the 215th Street subway
station on the IRT's Broadway local. You will come upon a complex
vista unlike any other in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   To the north, on your right, is the Harlem River on its final
leg before joining the Hudson in the swirl of Spuyten Duyvil. The
sheer cliff on the far side, threaded at its base by Metro North
tracks, defines Marble Hill, its heights studded with ungainly
apartment buildings. Straight ahead is a tidal lagoon. Bordered by
swamp grasses, it is the only accessible salt marsh in Manhattan
and a magnet for water birds. Off to the left are low rolling
athletic fields where soccer is the favored sport.
</P>
<P>
   Straight ahead, Inwood Hill itself juts into Spuyten Duyvil,
which is spanned by the Henry Hudson Bridge, its steel gridwork
painted bright red. Beyond that is the low-slung Amtrak bridge,
part of the shoreline route to Albany. The final piece of this
complex tableau is the noble New Jersey Palisades, looming up a
mile away across the Hudson.
</P>
<P>
   Before heading into the forest, stop first at the park's ecology
center (open 11 a.m. to 4 p.m. on weekdays, 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. on
weekends), on the lagoon. You can pick up a map as well as a
schedule of tours led by urban park rangers in all seasons. Even
canoe expeditions are offered. The center's displays are modest but
informative and very child friendly. There are also clean
restrooms, rare as screech owls in city parks.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone knows that, back in 1626, Peter Minuit bought Manhattan
from the Indians for $24 worth of trinkets. But few know where the
deal was struck. Right here, according to a tablet on a large
stone, Tablet Rock, also known as Shorakapkock Rock, near the 218th
Street entrance to Inwood Park. An ancient tulip tree grew at this
spot, said to be the oldest living thing in Manhattan. Indians held
powwows, with dances and chanting, under this tree every September
right up until it was finally cut down in 1938. They also held
canoe races in the river. An Indian named Princess Naomi, always
dressed in Indian clothing, once kept a trinket shop beside this
spot.
</P>
<P>
   Within a few steps of entering the park, you are in the Clove.
Almost magically, any and all signs of the city are shut off. A
steep, rockbound hillside rises to the right. Its rock ledges and
overhangs are known as the Indian Caves. Many artifacts of the
Shorakapkock Indians of the Delaware tribe have been found here.
This year's mild winter invited an early arrival of
Dutchman's-breeches and other spring ephemerals, which precede the
leafing of the trees. The Clove's season of copious dogwood also
came early. May brought on ferns, jack-in-the-pulpits and Solomon's
seal with its dangly little flowers. Last to appear are the highest
blossoms, the pale white ones of the tulip trees. As summer
deepens, blackberries and wineberries ripen along the path. They
are delectable.
</P>
<P>
   ``In geology, form and species, what you have here is close to a
Southern Appalachian bowl forest,'' explains Adrian Benape, the
Parks Department's Manhattan chief. What's extraordinary about that
comparison? Only that Benape is standing a few blocks from two
subway lines and less than a mile from the infamous drug-dealing
zone of Washington Heights.
</P>
<P>
   The path upward through the Clove is blocked here and there by
fallen trees and narrowed by bushes, including poison ivy.
Old-fashioned street lamps, installed in the 1960s, are all broken,
as they are throughout the park. And they will stay that way.
</P>
<P>
   ``They can't be defended against vandals,'' Stern explained.
``And without them, the park is more rustic.''
</P>
<P>
   As for those fallen trees, the idea is to let them become havens
for small creatures. The single biggest boon to Inwood Hill Park in
recent years was the blocking of its narrow, paved paths. They were
just wide enough for car thieves to drive into the wilderness,
where they could strip the cars in peace. Stanchions now prevent
their entry.
</P>
<P>
   Walking higher, you will leave behind the tulip trees, which
prefer the fertile soil of the valley floor. Oaks, maples and black
locusts now predominate. You will also see a pair of the largest
copper beeches in the city, their smooth-skinned, bulbous trunks
more than 14 feet in diameter. They flank what may also be the
city's most ancient ginkgo. Benape estimates its age at 150 years.
There are few evergreens in Inwood Hill forest.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Inwood, a neighborhood tucked away in the northwestern corner of
Manhattan, is easily reached by the IRT No. 1 train, stopping at
215th Street, or the A train, terminating at 207th Street. The
Urban Park Rangers maintain a year-round schedule of free walking
tours of Inwood Hill Park. All begin at the Urban Ecology Center,
inside the park at West 218th Street and Indian Road. Information:
(888) 697-2757 or (800) 201-PARK.

`MAFIA': A MAD LOOK AT THE MOB 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Production notes at end of review.) 
(th) 
 By JANET MASLIN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Mafia!'' makes an offer you could probably refuse. But its
Mad-style, hit-or-miss humor has enough hits, pardon the
expression, to keep it breezy and reasonably bright.
</P>
<P>
   This time Jim Abrahams, once part of the ``Airplane!'' team and
since then the auteur behind the ``Hot Shots!'' parodies, directs
his try-anything enthusiasm to the Godfather genre and comes up
with anything from canned meatballs by Spalding to a
turn-of-the-century Sicilian village with a ``Got vino?''
advertising campaign.
</P>
<P>
   In much the same spirit, Abrahams' official biography notes his
past work and adds: ``In addition to these pictures, Abrahams has
also attended screenings of `Gandhi' (1984), `Wall Street' (1988),
`Dances With Wolves' (1991) and `Silence of the Lambs' (1992).''
</P>
<P>
   It's true that a Mafia sendup without a single horse in a movie
producer's bed (and without anyone who sounds like Joe Pesci) has
left a stone or two unturned. It's also true that ``Mafia!'' has a
predictably gross, sophomoric streak and that some of it _ like the
original title, ``Jane Austen's `Mafia!''' _ has a way of falling
flat.
</P>
<P>
   But Abrahams dutifully takes on classics of the genre,
``Casino'' and the ``Godfather'' films, and succeeds in having his
share of irreverent fun.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not my father, Diane, just as you're not your father,''
the film's Michael Corleone type (Jay Mohr) tells his waspy fiance
(Christina Applegate). ``If we were our fathers, what we did last
night would be legal only in Arkansas.''
</P>
<P>
   Certain familiar scenes are inevitably revisited, like the
shooting of the patriarch called Don Cortino. (Lloyd Bridges, to
whose memory the film is dedicated, again showed how wonderfully
sporting and debonair he could be under the zaniest circumstances.)
</P>
<P>
   The Don appears to be dancing the macarena while being riddled
with bullets, and he later winds up unattended in a hospital room.
``No doctors, no nurses _ there's no one here to help him!'' Diane
exclaims. ``Diane, he belongs to an HMO,'' the Don's son explains.
</P>
<P>
   This parody also visits the Las Vegas of ``Casino'' to absurd
effect. (At the gaming tables, they're playing Chutes and Ladders
and go fish.) But it gets crazier and less obvious when it starts
throwing in everything but the kitchen sink.
</P>
<P>
   So during a ``Godfather''-esque montage mixing violent events
with a church ceremony, little baby raptors out of ``The Lost
World'' somehow figure in the equation. ``Jaws,'' ``Forrest Gump,''
the Lord of the Dance troupe and ``The English Patient'' also have
their unlikely places here, although the last one is used to
notably crude effect.
</P>
<P>
   Movies this summer seem determined to reveal how many new ways
there are to vomit, and so far there's no end in sight.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mafia!'' is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It
includes many numerous gross-outs and occasional mildly lewd gags.
</P>

FEMA TO HELP CALIFORNIA LANDSLIDE VICTIMS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ERIC BRAZIL  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ In a major policy shift, the federal government
has decided to make $20 million available to landslide victims in
California who agree to leave their houses and relocate.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're talking about buyouts. ... Purchase of the property. No
new construction,'' Michael Armstrong, associate director of the
Federal Emergency Management Agency, said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Historically, FEMA has provided financial assistance to victims
of fires, floods and earthquakes, but not landslides or mudslides.
</P>
<P>
   Heavy rains blamed on the El Nino weather phenomenon spawned
landslides that caused extensive damage to several dozen homes in
San Mateo and Sonoma counties.
</P>
<P>
   The state's Office of Emergency Services has just mailed grant
applications to 1,050 city and county managers, who will
investigate homeowner claims and recommend grant awards.
</P>
<P>
   Jurisdictions must submit notices of interest to the Office of
Emergency Services by Aug. 7. Individual homeowners must apply at
city halls or county seats from July 27 to Sept. 18.
</P>
<P>
   ``Local governments are expected to identify specific properties
for buyout,'' Armstrong said.
</P>
<P>
   OES Deputy Director Cheryl Tateishi said her office intends to
submit the list of approved applications for grants to FEMA by Oct.
19. Armstrong said successful applicants who are approved for
buyouts should start receiving their money in early November.
</P>
<P>
   To qualify for assistance, the property must be at ``imminent
landslide risk'' and uninhabitable. The cost of removal must not
exceed $140 per square foot of enclosed, heated living space, and
the property owner must relocate without rebuilding on the same
site.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a voluntary action,'' Armstrong said. Once the property
is acquired for public use by the local jurisdiction, it becomes
permanent open space, he said.

ANTIQUES: OVER THE TOP WITH DESIGN IN EVERYTHING 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By WENDY MOONAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ For our great-grandfathers, the concept of
commissioning a house or a room in a single, coordinated style was
novel. For them, art meant painting and sculpture.
</P>
<P>
   But the Esthetic Movement, which came to the United States from
England in the 1870s, emphasized the role of art in the creation of
furniture, fabrics, wallpaper, pottery and stained glass. Designers
like the Herter Brothers and Louis Comfort Tiffany felt confident _
as did Frank Lloyd Wright a few decades later _ that they could
design everything: the architecture and what went inside it,
including textiles, tables, chairs and lighting.
</P>
<P>
   And their clients believed they could, too. William H.
Vanderbilt had a Japanese parlor in his New York City mansion, just
as John D. Rockefeller had a Moorish smoking room. Margaret
Caldwell, a private Manhattan dealer in 19th-century American,
French and British furniture, explained that proponents of the
Esthetic Movement ``took design to a new, more opulent level for
clients who had made fortunes as profiteers in the Civil War.''
</P>
<P>
   ``These people wanted to go over the top,'' she said. ``They
were nouveaux riches.''
</P>
<P>
   The Esthetic Movement, which began in the mid-19th century as a
critique of the cold, factory-made products of the Industrial
Revolution, led to an insatiable appetite for exalted craftsmanship
and highly decorated material goods.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't forget, they called this `art' furniture,'' Ms. Caldwell
said. ``It was listed as a specialty among furniture makers, and
clients considered their work radical and chic.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, it is difficult to visualize the interior of a grand
Esthetic Movement house. There was pattern everywhere: on the
walls, ceilings, carpets, draperies, pillows and sofas. Ornament
covered everything. There were more tasseled lamps, vases, art
glass and upholstered furniture than you could shake a stick at.
</P>
<P>
   When you understand the visual complexity of the decorating
schemes, it becomes possible to appreciate that each piece of
furniture had to be able to stand on its own four legs, so to
speak. Ms. Caldwell has such furniture.
</P>
<P>
   She is selling two white oak dining chairs (from a set of 36)
that the Herter Brothers designed in 1879-83 for William H.
Vanderbilt's house at Fifth Avenue and 57th Street. Each chair has
a carved cornucopia and ribbon tied in a bow, a la Louis XV, on the
crest rail. Under the seat, the side stretchers are decorated with
a Greek key motif. The knees and ankles of the chairs have brass
plates, like Japanese furniture. On the skirt under the seat rail a
small peapod bursting with fat peas is carved discreetly at the
corner.
</P>
<P>
   ``All these cultural references have been put together on
purpose,'' Ms. Caldwell said, ``but people don't understand them
today.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Caldwell also has a circa 1878 library table ($95,000)
designed by Frank Furness, the Philadelphia architect made famous
by his flamboyant building for the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine
Arts in 1876, the year of the American Centennial. The Circassian
walnut table was designed for Henry Gibson, the president of the
Academy, in the Gothicized style created by Bruce Talbert, a
British architect who was the leading interpreter of the reform
Gothic style in England in the 1860s.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is close to the English Arts and Crafts style and rare,''
Ms. Caldwell said.
</P>
<P>
   On the more whimsical side, she has a Moorish Revival display
cabinet that she thinks was shown in the Chicago Exposition of
1893. It is a rosewood confection, totally asymmetrical, with
display shelves and drawers and specially made gilded brass
hardware. The secondary woods in the interior are mahogany, poplar
and white oak. There is a secret pen dawer in it, and the whole
cabinet comes apart in two pieces.
</P>
<P>
   It's a show-stopper, but it is not signed. As Ms. Caldwell said:
``What's so exciting about this field is that there is so little
known. There have been only a handful of museum shows, so it's one
of the last areas in the decorative arts to be explored.''
</P>
<P>
   Margot Johnson, a longtime private dealer in Manhattan
specializing in Esthetic Movement antiques, thinks the period has
appeal today because ``it has a modern look to it _ it's so
streamlined.''
</P>
<P>
   She has a large Esthetic Movement mirror of ebonized cherrywood
($125,000) that was made for the George Beale Sloane mansion in
Oswego, N.Y., in 1872. Its corners are inlaid with paler woods
depicting lion masks. There are Japanesque rosettes in ivory,
gilding around the frames, and gilded reeding.
</P>
<P>
   She is also selling a square rosewood occasional table with a
Japanesque flavor. It has one shelf with three slender spindles.
The top is inlaid with brass stringing, depicting a spider, a fly
and a butterfly. There are inlays of copper, mother of pearl and
pewter. It was made by A.&AMP; H. Lejambre of Philadelphia around 1880
and is very similar to a Lejambre table in the collection of the
St. Louis Art Museum, which was in the Metropolitan Museum of Art's
1987 show ``In Pursuit of Beauty: Americans and the Esthetic
Movement.''.
</P>
<P>
   For Ms. Johnson, the whimsical Lejambre table epitomizes the
best of the Esthetic Movement. ``There is no heaviness
whatsoever,'' she said. ``This is the most delicate, refined table
you could ever imagine.''
</P>
<P>
   Another singular piece Ms. Johnson is selling is a Louis Comfort
Tiffany three-panel screen made for the Kimball House in Rochester
in 1882. In the center of its rosewood frame is a large sheet of
amber glass covered with a fine, wirework design of Moorish
inspiration. The frame is embellished with Tiffany glass jewels in
a Moorish pattern. The sides are painted Whistler blue, and the
back of the screen depicts a Whistleresque nocturne. This may not
look modern, but it is as fabulous as any peacock. Price: $395,000.
</P>
<P>
   Americans are only beginning to appreciate the design,
craftsmanship and assemblage of materials that the Esthetic
Movement represents. They already know, however, that they need not
put these pieces back into their original environments. The total
look in Esthetic Movement antiques is beyond the skill (and
pocketbook) of most designers.
</P>
<P>
   These antiques have all the bells and whistles they need, all by
themselves, to grace even the most minimalist of interiors.

HOW TO INTERPRET THE POLICY LINE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RAY RATTO  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BURLINGAME, Calif. _ As you knew he would, Carmen Policy said
what he wanted to say, the way he wanted to say it, and left you to
read the volumes between his lines.
</P>
<P>
   So we shall. Policy spent Wednesday morning waving so long to
the area he called ``God's Garden Isle,'' and will be flashing his
sometimes mesmerizing smile to a gathering of Cleveland media some
time in the next two or three days as part of the proposed new
Browns' ownership group led by Al Lerner.
</P>
<P>
   All the better, one presumes, to exact a slow but steady revenge
upon the man who chased him out of San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   True, starting a professional football team from scratch with an
idea toward catching the 49ers isn't exactly the same as doing a
book report on ``Green Eggs And Ham'' based solely on the Cliff
Notes. If he really wanted to drop the surest and swiftest hammer
on his new enemy-for-life, Eddie DeBartolo, he would have taken a
job in the NFL office, taken the 49ers out of the NFC West and then
made them play 13 road games every year.
</P>
<P>
   But it is the road he chose, albeit one step ahead of the tall
skeletal figure with the scythe and the bad tailor. And while he
sat with his interim successor, Larry Thrailkill, acting the
cordial departee, he couldn't make the show go as smoothly as the
DeBartolos hoped he would.
</P>
<P>
   He said he and Denise DeBartolo York, with whom he was supposed
to have a tenuous relationship, spoke warmly when he handed in his
key to the executive one-chaired library, but said his relationship
with Eddie ``has been put through the deep freeze, and it hasn't
defrosted through the last number of months.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, Eddie still regards Policy as treacherous and
will hold that grudge deep into the next millennium. Policy even
said when a rapprochement comes, ``I'll be the one to pick up the
phone.'' In other words, they'll see each other again with a
funeral notice in the survivor's hand.
</P>
<P>
   He said he was ``keeping my options open,'' claiming that the
time was just right to go.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, the Cleveland thing was coming to a head,
Eddie's indictment seemed less likely than his return to full
operational control, and there was no guarantee that the getting
was going to be any better than it was right now.
</P>
<P>
   He joked with Thrailkill about ``getting a ring'' when the 49ers
win Super Bowl XXXIII. Thrailkill, a business guy who works in
Nashville, Tenn., and has not done press conferences as a regular
part of his job with the DeBartolo Corp., looked like he'd been
asked to swallow a live baby otter.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, someone with a jumbo air brush is going to start
looking through the old scrapbooks for pictures of Eddie and Carmen
together.
</P>
<P>
   When asked what he thought his legacy in San Francisco would be,
Policy dived in with both feet. ``I'd like my legacy to be one in
which I was a problem-solver, I handled stress and adversity and
transition in a straightforward, intelligent and appropriate way.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, he wants people to think that he consistently
saved the 49ers' considerable chestnuts from potential disaster.
Now who do you think could be included in that back end of that
response?
</P>
<P>
   As always, Policy was subtle, at least enough to make the
uninitiated think for a moment that he was leaving with something
other than a burning pike in his hand and a map to the thatched
roof of the DeBartolo mansion. He took care not to include Denise
York in that group, and was cordial enough to Thrailkill to
convince anyone who wondered that he had no problem with his
interim successor.
</P>
<P>
   But Eddie, he let swing in the breeze. He was no longer on
retainer to ``handle stress, adversity and transition'' for the
family. Let them solve their own problems now.
</P>
<P>
   What he leaves behind is an organization that Thrailkill will
soon wish he wasn't running. Thrailkill seemed surprised that
someone would question the organization's stability, which is very
much at the heart of Policy's departure. After all, Thrailkill said
no fewer than five times that he was only an interim successor.
</P>
<P>
   And immediately names came firing back _ Bill Walsh, Mike
Holmgren, Mike Shanahan. Policy hadn't even settled into his seat
in first class and already people were trying to fill Dwight
Clark's job, and scouting director Vinny Cerrato's, and maybe even
coach Steve Mariucci's as well.
</P>
<P>
   Stability? Are you kidding?
</P>
<P>
   Policy made his mistakes, to be sure. His tin ear as regards the
clumsy and noisome departures of Joe Montana, Ronnie Lott and
George Seifert gnaw at the edges of his resume, and he helped
distribute the panic DeBartolo felt when the Super Bowl was not
won.
</P>
<P>
   But he also gave the organization a tone for the post-Walsh era,
one that carried their run out of the '80s and into an improbable
18 years _ a level below the Yankees and Celtics, but on a par with
the Cleveland Browns of the '40s and '50s and the Canadiens of the
'50s and mid-'60s. And now he is leaving, with a footprint on his
hinder and bruises on his knuckles from the quicksilver jabs he
flicked on his way out. Mostly, he left upright, as you knew he
would.

`POODLE SPRINGS': A MARRIED MARLOWE AND A STRETCHED CHANDLER 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds.: Broadcast notes are at end of review. Time, channel are for
New York area. Check local listings.)  
 (bl)

<TEXT>
<P>
   To expand on the work of Raymond Chandler, who succeeded in
making literature out of the hard-boiled detective novel,
undoubtedly takes the sort of nerve that Chandler endowed upon his
proud, lonely philosopher-king of a gumshoe, Philip Marlowe.
</P>
<P>
   Nine years ago, Robert B. Parker took such a gamble by finishing
a last Marlowe novel that Chandler, who died in 1959, had laid
aside after only a tentative start.
</P>
<P>
   The result, ``Poodle Springs,'' was a defying-the-odds delight,
a homage to Chandler and his ideas about personal integrity that
artfully avoided parody.
</P>
<P>
   Now comes ``Poodle Springs'' the movie, which will have its
premiere on HBO Saturday night at 9, and it represents just as
great a gamble as that taken by Parker. Not only does this ``Poodle
Springs'' evoke Chandler's distinctive sentences and Parker's deft
approximation of them; it also summons memories of highly regarded
films of Chandler novels like Howard Hawks' ``Big Sleep'' and of
portrayals of Marlowe by actors as versatile as Humphrey Bogart,
Robert Mitchum, Elliott Gould and James Garner.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Marlowe is played by the equally worthy James Caan. The
film was directed by the old pro Bob Rafelson (``Five Easy
Pieces,'' ``The King of Marvin Gardens'') from a screenplay by the
playwright Tom Stoppard. The talent involved can't be questioned,
and the movie, skillfully set against those misleadingly
sun-splashed landscapes of long-ago Southern California, is a lot
of fun to watch.
</P>
<P>
   Whether it succeeds as a tribute to Chandler as well as Parker's
novel did is highly questionable, though _ largely a matter of how
an individual understands the essence of Chandler, a matter as
complex as a Chandler plot itself.
</P>
<P>
   At the center of the novel ``Poodle Springs'' is the shocking
fact that Marlowe has suddenly got himself married, to Linda
Potter, the lovely, wealthy daughter of the California power broker
Harlan Potter, and moved from Los Angeles to a blossoming desert
oasis near the Nevada border. This situation naturally tests
Marlowe's identity: he truly loves his wife, who is a good deal
smarter than her idle, hard-drinking friends, and he wants to try
to live with her in opulent digs, attended by Tino, a houseboy who
turns out to be a kindred independent spirit. But the detective
insists on making his own way financially and sets up shop in tony
downtown Poodle Springs.
</P>
<P>
   A case with typical Chandler ingredients comes his way: Muffy
Blackstone, another young Poodle Springs heiress whose father
wields power, has been abandoned by her husband, who has skipped on
a large gambling debt and turns out to be living a double life,
with a different wife, amid a pornography racket on the seamy side
of Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   As Marlowe travels in his weathered Olds back and forth between
his new home and his old Los Angeles milieu, resolution of the case
becomes less important than resolution of his existential
predicament: Now that he has indulged the romantic side of himself,
can he survive as a romantic while still investigating the squalid
realities of humankind?
</P>
<P>
   In creating the movie, Stoppard and Rafelson started with the
basics of the book but jumbled certain aspects of the story line,
changed some names and then upped the ante on the whole enterprise
of standing in for Chandler: they moved the time frame of ``Poodle
Springs'' from the '50s up to 1963, a year loaded with obvious
significance in American cultural mythology.
</P>
<P>
   In one sense, the time shift enhances Marlowe's emotional
crisis. The age gap between him and his wife (Dina Meyer) is
increased, which gives Caan plenty of creative room to explore the
fleetingness of hope and dignity, even given true love. And in his
dated fedora and simple black suit, he goes about it in a wonderful
way.
</P>
<P>
   He's bloated but able to throw a punch. He's elderly but
believable in the arms of a gorgeous woman. Most important, in his
delivery of one-liners and in a wordless shift of an eye, Caan
knows how to communicate the deep levels of wise, tough sympathy
that have defined Marlowe from ``The Big Sleep'' on.
</P>
<P>
   In another sense, however, the time shift tends to work against
Caan's authentic characterization of Marlowe's internal drama by
injecting into the movie details of historical tension that belong
to a different era of American thriller. The specter of
presidential assassination; conspiracies among big business, big
crime and big politics that are national and global rather than
local; the fact that Marlowe's young wife is a lawyer: all of this
feels standard and beside the point. It doesn't help much that the
supporting cast is a well-chosen one that includes, most notably,
David Keith as the wayward husband, Nia Peeples and Julia Campbell
as his cheated-upon wives and Brian Cox and Joe Don Baker as the
power-broker fathers.
</P>
<P>
   Chandler always set the mystery of Philip Marlowe against the
mystery of American culture, but in his hands, the background never
fought the foreground. Here, despite the work of many talented
people, Marlowe starts to seem oddly _ and wrongly _ insignificant.

A WAR MOVIE THAT DELIVERS A MESSAGE THAT IS PROFOUNDLY ANTI-WAR
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TIM MADIGAN 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Be warned if you haven't seen it already. The new movie ``Saving
Private Ryan'' is not entertainment. When the final credits roll,
audiences will sit in stunned and exhausted silence. Many will have
left the theater by then, forced away by the unrelenting gore from
Steven Spielberg's latest masterpiece.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the words jotted in my notebook during a recent
screening:
</P>
<P>
   Guts.
</P>
<P>
   Limbs.
</P>
<P>
   Noise.
</P>
<P>
   Intestines.
</P>
<P>
   Cries for mama.
</P>
<P>
   Sulfur on wounds.
</P>
<P>
   Cries for morphine.
</P>
<P>
   Chaos.
</P>
<P>
   Critics hail ``Saving Private Ryan'' as the best war movie ever
made, which may or may not be true. What is inarguable is that the
film starring Tom Hanks and Matt Damon is history's most
``realistic'' movie about combat ever made.
</P>
<P>
   In the opening sequence, American GIs are slaughtered
indiscriminately on Omaha Beach during the landing at Normandy. We
have known of that slaughter since high school civics. But, for the
first time, we watch from a few inches away, riding in the same
troop carrier through choppy seas, as bullets penetrate foreheads,
as limbs are torn from torsos, as intestines hang open like thick,
coiled pasta, as blood-reddened sea water washes up over scores of
corpses on the sand.
</P>
<P>
   We watch as life slowly oozes from an American infantryman who
begs for morphine as blood pumps from a stomach wound and comrades
caress his face with bloody hands. We watch as American GIs shoot
German prisoners of war. Our ears echo from the noise.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what happens in real life, in real war,'' says Stephen
Ambrose, the pre-eminent World War II historian who was a
consultant for the film. ``The only thing missing from this movie
is the smell of battle.''
</P>
<P>
   With the addition of ``Saving Private Ryan,'' Spielberg has
given us two of the most disturbing films of our time. But in
``Schindler's List,'' the evil was more implied. We knew the Jews
were destined for horrible ends, but in most cases we never saw
them die. In ``Private Ryan,'' very little is left to the
imagination. A GI carries his severed arm across the beach. Bodies
are tossed like rag dolls by exploding artillery shells.
</P>
<P>
   That is what happens in war.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   I am of a generation, not yet born for World War II and Korea,
too young for Vietnam, for whom war remains an alien concept. The
notion of being called to arms and ordered to kill is surreal. When
it comes to war, we enjoy the luxury of dark curiosity.
</P>
<P>
   We played soldier as boys, imitating the guys on the hit TV
series ``Combat,'' where each week Vic Morrow and his squad
prevailed against the Germans. American deaths in that show were
quick and clean, done for dramatic effect alone. The same was true
in our favorite movies, like ``The Battle of the Bulge'' and ``The
Longest Day.''
</P>
<P>
   War was glamorous to us then, somewhat less so years later when
we listened to Walter Cronkite speak of Vietnam body counts, read
of ambushes, saw older brothers and friends and cousins come home
in body bags, saw other veterans return to something called
post-traumatic stress disorder.
</P>
<P>
   But Vietnam, in its ambiguity, was different. Who ever heard of
post traumatic stress among veterans of World War II, where the
objective was so clear? Somehow, the rightness of our cause in
World War II mitigated its horror, made it more like TV shows and
movies where American GIs, if they had to die at all, died quick,
bloodless deaths. The enemy always had it worse in the end. Or so
we were allowed to believe.
</P>
<P>
   Then, only four years ago, a few paragraphs in a newspaper story
began the process of stripping away my naivete. The story told of
American paratroopers during the invasion of Normandy, landing not
on dry ground, but in fields flooded by the Germans precisely for
the purpose. Scores of paratroopers drowned that way, sucked to the
bottom by their own equipment. Comrades listened helplessly to
their screams before going through with their missions. No soldier
died like that on ``Combat.''
</P>
<P>
   In the years to follow, I read the books of historian Stephen
Ambrose and interviewed a couple dozen surviving World War II vets
_ paratroopers, infantrymen, now in their late 60s and 70s _ hoping
eventually to weave their stories into a meaningful work of
fiction.
</P>
<P>
   There was hand-to-hand combat on Normandy, they said, and frozen
American GIs in the Battle of the Bulge, stumbling through
waist-deep snow into the teeth of German defenses, cut down one
after another, lumps of bodies in the snow until the days when
sheer Allied numbers prevailed.
</P>
<P>
   There was the nervous fury of WWII veteran Otis Mackey's
rocking, back and forth in his chair, as if the pace of his rocking
could somehow becalm memories no human should have to bear.
</P>
<P>
   In his first day of combat, Mackey told me one day last year, a
good friend was shot through the neck and killed. Sometime later in
the war, while hiking down a road to Berlin, Mackey's sergeant
tripped a land mine only a few feet away.
</P>
<P>
   ``The leg with combat boot and all ... I had to duck,'' said
Mackey, a man now in his 70s. ``I seen it coming at me. I just
ducked, and McGhee's leg went flying right by my head. ... I was
right there ready to step on that mine. ... I never could figure
out why it was him and not me.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I first came out, I drank quite a bit,'' Mackey said of
the war. ``I don't know why my wife even stayed with me.''
</P>
<P>
   Through men like Mackey, World War II was transformed in my mind
into a war of awful death and flying body parts. Of buddies shot
through the throat. Of the smell of human entrails laid open by hot
metal. Of weeks on the front without showers or hot food. Of dads
and grandfathers who for decades remained mute about the horror,
who lived in fear of their nightmares and worked 16-hour days to
keep the bad dreams at bay.
</P>
<P>
   So I knew before ``Saving Private Ryan'' that our last good war
was as appalling as the rest. But nothing short of actually having
been there will prepare a person for the unblinking genius of
Steven Spielberg, who lets us see it in person.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   There is no big picture in ``Saving Private Ryan,'' no
intimation of the grand strategy for conquering Hitler, of why such
carnage that unfolds onscreen is necessary. And that's the way it
is in combat. There's little rhyme or reason to it. Not for the
little guy, the grunt soldier. Just an intense focus on immediate
surroundings, on survival. Chaos and gore. Some moviegoers will
turn away in horror. But Spielberg makes it clear that soldiers a
half-century ago never had that luxury.
</P>
<P>
   So rather than entertainment, ``Saving Private Ryan'' is a dark,
no-holds-barred allegory, terrible medicine to inoculate the world
against future outbreaks of war fever. It is an important movie.
But those who attend would do well to brace themselves. Everyone in
the audience pays for a ticket, and then the movie extracts an
emotional price, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``He doesn't set out to do an anti-war movie. He sets out to do
a war movie, but the effect is a movie that is profoundly
anti-war,'' says Stephen Ambrose. ``I guess it reinforces, in a
way, that when you go to war, man, do it prayerfully. Do it
carefully. Make goddam sure you don't have any alternatives.''

`PRIVATE RYAN' IS POWERFUL, SHATTERING EXPERIENCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WILLIAM ARNOLD  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   I might as well say this straight off: Steven Spielberg's
near-three-hour ``Saving Private Ryan'' is quite simply one of the
most powerful war movies ever made, and a shattering emotional
experience. Be warned: this one is not for the faint of heart.
</P>
<P>
   Contrary to earlier reports, it's not exactly an anti-war film.
Though it plays with a central incongruity and makes us want to get
as far away from war as possible, it believes in the crusade
against Hitler, and displays little of the irony or ambivalence of
its reputed model, David Lean's ``The Bridge on the River Kwai.''
</P>
<P>
   It's essentially a combat film: a gritty, harrowingly authentic
account of what it must have been like to be a dogface in the midst
of America's bloodiest war _ so real and immediate and unrelenting
that it creates much of the same kind of battle stress in its
audience that the real participants must have felt.
</P>
<P>
   The film opens with a devastating, 30-minute sequence of the
D-Day landing on Omaha Beach during World War II: a sequence shot
mostly in a jumpy, handheld-camera style, but that is so skillful
and so progressively unsettling that it soon wipes away our memory
of ``The Longest Day,'' ``Platoon,'' and just about every other war
movie ever made. It puts us in a different psychological place
altogether.
</P>
<P>
   The script then settles into its premise: a story about a
special mission given a veteran Army captain (Tom Hanks) to find a
certain Private Ryan (Matt Damon) whose three brothers have been
killed in combat that same week and who General George Marshall
(Harve Presnell) personally wants to get back to his mother in
Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   The captain gathers a squad of men, and the rest of the film
follows their episodic journey deep into France as they look for
the illusive title character who parachuted behind enemy lines on
D-Day _ culminating in yet another extended battle sequence in a
French village that is almost as horrifying as the opening scenes.
</P>
<P>
   In the same way he managed to find an upbeat message in the
Holocaust (``Schindler's List'') and the shame of American Slavery,
(``Amistad'') Spielberg's message here is a positive one. As futile
and even absurd as it may seem to risk the lives of eight men to
``rescue'' a man who might already be dead, Spielberg sees the
mission as one of nobility _ the kind of nobility of spirit that
differentiated us from our enemy in that conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Yet it's so hyper-realistic for such a long period of screen
time, and the audience goes (literally, I'll wager) into such a
state of shock, that this message falls a bit flat. It's hard to
feel anything but primal fear, and hard to even notice the subtle
theme, the innovative camerawork of Janusz Kaminski and the fine,
understated performances of Hanks, Damon, Tom Sizemore and the rest
of the cast.
</P>
<P>
   It's not just the gore either _ the arms blown off, the heads
removed from bodies before our eyes, the faces reduced to
hamburger. We've seen all this before. The horror of the film is
more in the way it conveys a sense of utter helplessness, the
perverse element of chance at work and the sheer magnitude and
impersonality of the slaughter. Combat on film never has seemed so
agonizingly unappealing.
</P>
<P>
   How then do you classify such an experience? Art? Entertainment?
An epic adventure? To be accurate, it's none of the above. Nor is
it a thriller, a character piece, or a penetrating study of men in
war. Despite the presence of mega-star Hanks in the lead, he's so
constrained and understated it's not even a star vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   The film is more properly a ``trip'' movie, a Spielbergian
theme-park ride that induces emotional stress instead of thrills _
the very flip side of ``Indiana Jones.'' By forcing its audience to
experience what war is really like, ``Saving Private Ryan'' is not
only an extraordinary educational experience that widens our

`CANNIBAL: THE MUSICAL': GOLD, GORE AND A SINGING CANNIBAL

   Try to arrive a few minutes late for ``Cannibal: The Musical.''
That way you'll miss the revolting sight of bloody, amputated body
parts, the trademarks of Troma, the filmmakers who gave the world
``The Toxic Avenger'' and ``Surf Nazis Must Die!''
</P>
<P>
   After the gory first scene, the movie is not completely
appalling.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cannibal! The Musical,'' which was completed in 1994, is
making it into theaters now largely because of Trey Parker and Matt
Stone, the young creators of ``South Park,'' Comedy Central's
animated series about third graders and four-letter words. Parker
wrote, directed and stars in the film. Stone plays a prospector and
is one of the producers. Their work here is still amateurish but
has flashes of real humor.
</P>
<P>
   The film is inspired by the true story of Alferd Packer (
Parker), an 1870s gold prospector, and how he came to be convicted
of cannibalism. In the beginning, Alferd is a happy-go-lucky guy
who loves his horse, Leanne, and just being alive, as you can tell
from the lyrics of his first song: ``The sky is blue and all the
leaves are green. The sun's as warm as a baked potato.'' A few
lines later, he sings, ``My heart's as full as a baked potato.''
</P>
<P>
   The men he travels with from Utah to Colorado are not a
particularly bright or tough bunch. When they meet a group of
trappers, they're horrified to learn that trapping involves killing
little animals. When a man gets unruly, he's sentenced to a
20-minute ``time out.'' When they come across the Grand Canyon, one
says: ``We'll just walk around it. It can't be that big.'' When
they run into a band of ``Indians'' who are clearly Japanese, they
don't notice anything unusual.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, before the cannibalism, they build a snowman,
encounter a Confederate cyclops and pursue a horse thief. Alferd
tells his story to pretty Polly Prye (Toddy Walters), a sympathetic
listener who turns out to be a reporter for The Denver Post. This
all leads up to a huge musical number in which the jubilant
townspeople dance and sing in the streets about the joys of
watching a hanging. (A typical line: ``When his tongue rolls out,
we'll know.'')
</P>
<P>
   It's all pretty stupid, but at times, there are refreshingly
ludicrous notes that even people old enough to see this movie
without a guardian can appreciate. One approach: Imagine the film
taking place in ``South Park'' animation. If Cartman were ripping
that man's arm off and eating it, it might be cute.
</P>

`HOPE IN A JAR': HOW WOMEN SPAWNED AMERICA'S BEAUTY CULTURE 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: Publication notes appear at the end of the review.) 
(th) 
 By ALEX WITCHEL    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   A week before final exams, my college roommate skipped a day of
classes to go into Boston to Saks Fifth Avenue for the opening of
the Erno Lazslo Skincare Clinic. Six hours and a few hundred
dollars later, she returned with her new ``skin system,'' some
white bottles and a bar of black soap. From that day on, everyone
called her Erno.
</P>
<P>
   I thought of Erno while reading Kathy Peiss' meticulously,
almost lovingly, researched social history, ``Hope in a Jar: The
Making of America's Beauty Culture.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Peiss, a professor of history at the University of
Massachusetts and the author of the highly praised ``Cheap
Amusements: Working Women and Leisure in Turn-of-the-Century New
York,'' no doubt has her own flock of Ernos to contend with, though
with her kind of academic writing (always clear, sometimes dry),
they would be well advised to stop skipping class.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Peiss approaches the cosmetics industry not with the
feminist cry of the 1960s that the men who run it victimize women
by objectifying them, but with the premise that the beauty business
was built largely by women for women from the 1890s to the 1920s.
</P>
<P>
   ``The very notion of femininity, emphasizing women's innate
taste for beauty, opened opportunities for women in this business,
even as it restricted them elsewhere,'' she writes. ``And women
seized their chances, becoming entrepreneurs, investors,
manufacturers, distributors and promoters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Handicapped in pursuing standard business practices, they
resourcefully founded salons, beauty schools, correspondence
courses and mail-order companies; they pioneered in the development
of modern franchising and direct-sales marketing strategies.
</P>
<P>
   ``The beauty trade they developed did not depend upon
advertising as its impetus. Rather, it capitalized on patterns of
women's social life _ their old customs of visiting, conversation
and religious observance, as well as their new presence in shops,
clubs and theaters.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Peiss notes that with the advent of photography in 1839,
people began to see themselves in a new (and suddenly permanent)
way. They also started seeing photographs of celebrities:
actresses, socialites, ballet dancers. ``Middle-class Americans,''
she writes, ``often placed these images in their personal albums,
often on the same pages as photographs of family and friends.''
</P>
<P>
   She traces the 19th-century obsession with skin whitening by
powdering and ``painting,'' which women often did secretly. Though
recipe books for cosmetics were common, some women used commercial
products like Laird's Bloom of Youth, which landed more than one of
them in the hospital with lead poisoning.
</P>
<P>
   The obsession with whiteness went so far that one startling
advertisement Ms. Peiss includes from a 1903 issue of The Colored
American Magazine boasted of a product called ``Black Skin
Remover'' with a ``before'' drawing of a black woman and an
``after'' drawing of a white woman.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to telling the stories of the era's two leaders, who
sold their products to wealthy white women and whose names still
endure _ Helena Rubinstein and Elizabeth Arden _ Ms. Peiss includes
their African-American counterparts, Madam C.J. Walker and Annie
Turnbo Malone.
</P>
<P>
   Malone began her business in Illinois by manufacturing the
product Wonderful Hair Grower and with her sister went from town to
town demonstrating the shampoo on herself. She eventually expanded
the business and moved it to St. Louis, where she sold her renamed
Poro product nationally.
</P>
<P>
   Madam C.J. Walker, born Sarah Breedlove, was the child of former
slaves who became a Poro agent, then developed her own hair-care
product. She married a newspaperman, Charles J. Walker, who helped
her start an advertising campaign and mail-order business. She
settled in Indianapolis and also expanded nationally. By 1918 she
employed thousands of sales agents _ black women whose alternative
employment choices were as servants or field hands _ and had annual
gross sales of $275,000.
</P>
<P>
   For blacks and whites alike, the ``by women, for women'' beauty
culture reigned from the 1890s through the 1910s. But as Ms. Peiss
points out, during that same time ``an emergent class of managers
and professionals were developing new methods that would come to
dominate American business.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They devised a system of mass production, distribution,
marketing and advertising that transformed local patterns of buying
and selling and fostered a culture of consumption,'' she writes.
``By 1920, new cosmetics firms, led primarily by men, embraced
these methods to create a mass market and sell beauty products to
all women.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The toilet goods counter and all that it can be made to
suggest is, to thousands of women, the very nearest they can ever
come to romance,'' stated one promoter.
</P>
<P>
   By the mid 1930s, cosmetics had become so much an accepted part
of the culture, Ms. Peiss writes, that ``social scientists reported
that personal appearance significantly influenced young women's
self-expression and self-esteem, findings publicized in magazines
for parents.''
</P>
<P>
   It took until the late '60s for feminists to ``indict the beauty
industry as a cornerstone of women's oppression,'' which only
prompted the creation of ``the natural look'' and invoked the
``liberated'' woman as a beauty type. ``The view manufacturers had
long promoted,'' she writes, ``that identity was an esthetic choice
any woman could put on and wash off _ proved surprisingly
malleable.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Peiss seems somewhat less enamored of her more recent
material than she does of the beauty culture at its beginnings. Her
often vividly anecdotal writing gives way to excessive statistics
and generalized pronouncements, and though she refers glancingly to
some of Estee Lauder's companies, she tells no story of the woman
herself in the context of her times or of her female contemporaries
_ Georgette Klinger, say. She also makes little mention of the
proliferation of plastic surgery, the newest cosmetic industry.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, however, Ms. Peiss has given a strong structural
framework to the story of why women, over the last century, have
been drawn to makeup, to the power of illusion, the possibility of
transformation, the fleeting combinations of hope and fear, romance
and ego, fantasy and reality that most women experience each time
they look in the mirror. They were _ and are _ all prey to hope in
a jar, the phrase coined by Charles Revson, the founder of Revlon.
</P>
<P>
   Which is not necessarily a bad thing, as Ms. Peiss stresses. On
that fateful night when Erno returned from Boston, she had the
unmistakable air of victory about her. Hope might indeed come in a
jar _ or a bottle or a bar of black soap _ but make no mistake. If
it did, she owned it.

<P>
   How many dead grasshoppers add up to one dead cow?
</P>
<P>
   All those grasshoppers floating on North Texas lakes last week
didn't increase the risk of disease, but they did add a whole lot
more organic material for bacteria to eat and multiply, says James
Perdue of the Infectious Disease, Epidemiology and Surveillance
Division at the Texas Department of Health.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, most of them were just cooling off _ not drowning. But
thousands of them were floating in Eagle Mountain Lake northwest of
Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of the insects ended up as fish food, I hope. But I called
Perdue, who tracks possible health hazards associated with fresh
water and other environmental elements in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Grasshoppers don't carry disease,'' he said. ``But, any
increase in organic content potentially increases bad bacteria in
fresh water.
</P>
<P>
   ``You wouldn't get in the water if there were a dead cow in the
water, so I guess you could figure out how many dead grasshoppers
make a dead cow,'' Perdue said, only partly in jest.
</P>
<P>
   I say partly because Perdue takes health hazards very seriously.
</P>
<P>
   With the temperature rising, it isn't surprising that so many
people are looking to water to cool off. But as the heat goes up
and water levels go down, the potential for health problems grows.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can look at the problems associated with swimming in fresh
water like a pyramid,'' Perdue says. ``At the broad bottom, you
have a lot of microorganisms and bacteria that can cause such mild
problems as ear infections, swimmer's itch or intestinal diseases.
At the top point, you have the very dangerous but relatively rare
problems such as primary amoebic meningoencephalitis.''
</P>
<P>
   This infection, which public health officials dub ``PAM,'' is
caused by a common microorganism found in most untreated surface
water and in all types of soil. It killed five people in Texas in
the summer of 1995, including a child from Euless learning to water
ski in a quiet cove at Possum Kingdom Lake.
</P>
<P>
   During drought and high temperature conditions, concentrations
of the naegleria fowleri amoebas that cause PAM increase as they
feed on the bacteria in the warm water. The organism thrives in a
water temperature above 80 degrees. PAM is most often associated
with water forced up the nose.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before you put your head underwater in a stagnant pond or
inlet, think about it,'' Perdue says. ``If the water looks yucky,
don't get in.''
</P>
<P>
   TDH offers these recommendations to avoid infection:
</P>
<P>
   _Never swim in stagnant or polluted water. Take ``No Swimming''
signs seriously.
</P>
<P>
   _Hold your nose or use plugs when jumping into water.
</P>
<P>
   _Avoid swallowing water when swimming.
</P>
<P>
   _Keep wading pools clean and change the water daily.
</P>
<P>
   _Wash cuts and scratches with clean water and soap after
swimming.
</P>
<P>
   _Use earplugs, swim goggles or masks if you tend to get ear or
eye infections.
</P>
<P>
   _Swim in properly maintained pools treated with chlorine, shower
before swimming, and take young children to the restroom
frequently.

`LOUIS COMFORT TIFFANY': TIFFANY AS DESIGNER, DECORATOR, PRODUCER 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Exhibition notes are at the end of review.) 
(js) 
 By ROBERTA SMITH   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Austere is not the usual modifier when it comes to
Louis Comfort Tiffany. In the last two decades of the 19th century,
the interior decoration company carrying the name of this
painter-turned-designer defined the height of luxury for wealthy,
esthetically adventurous New Yorkers and set standards of
ostentatious propriety in churches across the country.
</P>
<P>
   His name conjures up all kinds of visual extravagances: the
glowing opulence of stained-glass windows and the shimmering
surfaces of vases resplendent with peacock-feather and lily-pad
motifs. His lavish private interiors, few of which still exist,
were legendary for their mixtures of exotic materials and cultural
sources _ Japanese, Chinese, Celtic, Indian and American Indian.
And don't forget Tiffany lamps, whose stained-glass shades are
seemingly heavy with rich colors and overripe patterns of fruit or
flowers.
</P>
<P>
   But the exhibition that the Metropolitan Museum of Art is
devoting to this leader of the Esthetic Movement, which
forward-looking American artists had imported from England by the
1870s, is startlingly spare and understated. The 130 items on view
are all drawn from the museum's sizable Tiffany collection, which
it began to accumulate as early as 1896. The works are mostly small
and are generously spaced, if not isolated, in noticeably plain and
ungussied galleries.
</P>
<P>
   One of the first watercolors in the show suggests that this
low-key setting may differ from the installation Tiffany himself
would have come up with. It is a design for a gallery that was
built at the Art Institute of Chicago to hold a bequest of
19th-century French paintings: apple-green velvet walls, a metallic
stenciled screen and a fireplace faced in bronze and black-glass
mosaic and flanked by six ebony columns.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibition was organized by Alice Cooney Frelinghuysen,
curator of decorative American arts at the Met, and, in yet another
questionable instance of overtly self-promoting corporate support,
is sponsored by Tiffany &AMP; Company. It gives a fairly full
accounting of the kinds of objects produced by Tiffany's company
(which was first known as Louis Tiffany &AMP; Co. and later as the
Tiffany Glass Co., the Tiffany Glass and Decorating Co. and,
finally, the Tiffany Studios). In addition to the windows, vases
and lamps and a few detailed studies for interiors that hint at the
perfect-pitch eclecticism that Tiffany could muster, there are
examples of boxes in enamel or carved wood, jewelry, furniture,
ceramic vases, candelabra and andirons, favrile and gilt bronze
desk sets and one of the few surviving examples of Tiffany-designed
fabric, a dove-gray silk velvet printed with pale red floral
designs.
</P>
<P>
   In the Met's pared-down presentation, Tiffany's vision is
conveyed in small doses that you can savor in detail and
cross-reference with one another. Here one can consider his
experimental ways with materials, especially glass; his oscillation
between accurate representations and semi-abstractions based on
natural forms, and his uncanny range of beautiful engrossing
details, some of them serendipitously accidental, others reflecting
an almost excruciating level of control.
</P>
<P>
   The first gallery contains an early warning sign of just how
detailed things can get: the sloping arms of a pair of armchairs
are dotted with small diamonds of wood inlay. Look very closely:
the inlay, based on American Indian textile designs, feature nearly
microscopic grid patterns.
</P>
<P>
   Tiffany was born in New York City in 1848 into comfortable
circumstances. He was the son of Charles Lewis Tiffany, founder of
Tiffany &AMP; Co., the jewelry company, which was becoming known
throughout the world for its designs in silver. Louis Comfort
Tiffany, given a Frenchified version of his father's name,
originally intended to become a painter; he studied informally with
the painter George Inness, first exhibited his work at the National
Academy of Design at the age of 19 and became a member four years
later. But something pulled him toward design.
</P>
<P>
   It may have been his exposure to the decorative arts as
exemplified by the displays of silver, jewelry, and ceramics in his
father's Union Square showroom, or a trip to Egypt and Northern
Africa with the painter (soon to turn designer) Samuel Colman in
the spring of 1870. It may have been the influence of George Moore,
the brilliant chief designer at his father's company, who had an
extensive library of books about the world's decorative arts _
ancient, Asian, medieval, Islamic _ and an impressive collection of
objects representing those different cultures, many of which
inspired his own designs. Both the library and the collection were
bequeathed to the Metropolitan at Moore's death in 1891.
</P>
<P>
   Moore advised Tiffany to take up interior decoration. In 1879,
the year he formed an interior decoration company with Colman, the
furniture designer Lockwood de Forest and the textile designer
Candace Wheeler, he wrote to Wheeler of his new profession: ``I
believe there is more in it than in painting pictures.''
</P>
<P>
   This exhibition begins with two rather unimaginative paintings _
``Snake Charmer at Tangier, Africa'' (circa 1872) and ``Marketplace
at Nuremberg'' (circa 1893) _ and bears out this conviction.
Tiffany never stopped making paintings, but he did not exhibit
publicly after the late 1870s. By the early 1880s, he found a new
outlet for his painterly talents, in the medium of glass. By 1892,
he had invented and named the favrile glass process, which involved
blending different colors of semimolten glass.
</P>
<P>
   The idea that Tiffany was a painter in glass, that he expressed
himself most fully and most radically in this material, is several
decades old. But that doesn't make it any less interesting to see
it demonstrated in actual artworks.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In stained-glass windows like ``Magnolia and Irises,'' Tiffany
folded and shaped semimolten glass to form expanses of white
blossoms, whose different thicknesses create a dimensional effect,
and whose varying whites suggest veining, shading and natural
light. In ``Autumn Landscape,'' a work of striking if cloying
verisimilitude, the glass was swirled and rippled to create the
effect of rocks and a rushing brook and embedded with tiny flakes
of paper-thin glass to simulate the uneven reds and oranges of
turning leaves.
</P>
<P>
   This last work, a large three-part window from 1923-1924, is not
in the current show but is on permanent display in the Charles
Engelhard Court outside the American Wing, where this exhibition is
located. Also in the court is a large glass mosiac, ``Landscape and
Fountain,'' an installation of the big lily-topped columns and
mosaic-covered lintel that formed the entrance to Laurelton Hall,
Tiffany's home in Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y., along with several
other works. Together they give an idea of Tiffany on a grander
scale.
</P>
<P>
   The appreciation of Tiffany's innovations can be sharpened by
comparing the colors and painterly variations of his stained-glass
windows with the rich but even tones that prevail in the windows
included in the fascinating Edward Burne-Jones exhibition, also at
the Metropolitan. William Morris, who fabricated the windows from
Burne-Jones' designs, researched and resurrected medieval
stained-glass techniques; Tiffany reinvented them.
</P>
<P>
   In the favrile glass vases, Tiffany, or his artisans, learned to
guide contrasting colors of semimolten glass into precise (and
repeating) linear patterns that suggested feathers, leaves and
vines. In his ``Cypriote'' vases, he approximated the shimmering
encrusted surfaces of ancient glass; in one irregularly shaped
work, he contrasted pearlescent passages with rough black areas
that suggest lava. In some works he suspended colored shapes
between layers of translucent glass; in others, the glass is shiny,
opaque and intensely colored, like glazed ceramic.
</P>
<P>
   In the large, round favrile vase from 1903, green and red shapes
loosely suggestive of leaves, vines and berries have been
ingeniously sandwiched between layers of matte translucent glass
that has a goldish tint in certain lights. The effect is hypnotic
and reverie-inducing, of plants floating just beneath the surface
of a pool, softening toward disintegration.
</P>
<P>
   With this vase and with a few others whose skeins of color are
similarly relaxed and even more random, Jackson Pollock's drip
paintings may come to mind. This is not at all surprising. Such
gestural abstraction appeared first in the decorative arts _
usually in ceramics, including Tang vases, early Edo tea bowls and
the humble Redware pots of early 19th-century America. Tiffany's
favrile vases were simply one of the last stopping-off points
before such painterliness entered the realm of painting proper.
</P>
<P>
   In 1917, in step with developments on canvas, Tiffany looked
back across his career and wrote, ``The sovereign importance of
color is only beginning to be realized.'' In words remarkably
reminiscent of Kandinsky's writings, he continued: ``These
light-vibrations have a subjective power and affect the mind and
soul, producing feelings and ideas of their own.''

   NEW YORK _ Tricky is an artist of the backward flow, dedicated
to the path that veers in unforeseen directions. The
composer-performer, who appeared at the Hammerstein Ballroom on
Tuesday night, grounds his music in a reversal; he turns the
intensity of hip-hop, pop's most potent forum for boasts and tall
tales, into a means for deep introversion.
</P>
<P>
   Tricky's stories are the kinds people repeat endlessly, but only
to themselves. They are constructed from forbidden desires,
nightmares, festering anger and fear. Mixing hip- hop's deep beats
with the time-stretching meters of dub reggae and jazz syncopation,
floating vocals above the polyrhythms like thought balloons, Tricky
has created a new sound of consciousness.
</P>
<P>
   Yet for all its spaciness, Tricky's music is grounded in the
particular testimony of a young black man whose dreams are often
thwarted and whose rage and hunger consume him. Although he is
British, Tricky's fascinations connect him to mysterious American
protagonists who embody society's shifting racial tensions: Robert
Johnson, Ralph Ellison's fictional Invisible Man, hip-hop's martyr
and antihero Tupac Shakur.
</P>
<P>
   Tricky's understanding of this complicated position is
increasing along with his musical skills. His latest album,
``Angels With Dirty Faces'' (Island), is extremely varied, ranging
from speedy hard-core techno to lush ambient grooves. Live, Tricky
highlighted his aggressive side: his once-raspy voice has
strengthened considerably, and he rearranged old songs like
``Suffocated Love'' and new ones like ``Lyrics of Fury'' as
spirited rants.
</P>
<P>
   The catalyst for this tumult was Tricky's drummer, Perry Melius.
Although Tricky's albums remain diffuse and contemplative, under
Melius' sway his shows have become funkfests, twisting the legacy
of James Brown and George Clinton to include electronic beats and
samples. Tricky's rapping often seemed like a sparring match with
Melius; he would unleash a phrase, then recoil, dealt a stunning
blow by the drummer's snare. His more sinuous melodies were relayed
by two vocalists, Carmen Ejogo and Denise Ellington.
</P>
<P>
   Tricky's usual partner, Martina Topley-Bird, is sitting out this
tour to care for their toddler daughter. Her substitutes never
quite matched her hypnotic abilities, but both traversed the range
of the music's mutating emotions.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, though, this was Tricky's psychodrama, and its
highlight came with ``Carriage for Two,'' a new song about his
daughter. As Ms. Ejogo languidly intoned lyrics from ``God Bless
the Child'' and the band built a groove as cool and irrevocable as
fate, Tricky shouted out words of pride and hope, his voice tinged
with desperation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your father's rich,'' he muttered, bending a phrase from
``Porgy and Bess,'' another story of the soul's wrestling match
with oppression. The nod indicated which struggle Tricky sees his
art engaging, and his fury showed he's more determined than ever to
win.

MEDIAN PRICE OF A HOME IN THE BAY AREA HITS NEW RECORD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By GEORGE RAINE  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The median price of an existing, single-family
detached home in the San Francisco Bay area climbed 17.1 percent in
June to $335,740, a record. The national median price is $129,400.
</P>
<P>
   The California Association of Realtors also reported that sales
of homes rose 17.1 percent in June, compared to June 1997. The
report covers seven counties in the San Francisco Bay area, but not
Napa and Sonoma.
</P>
<P>
   ``While sales and price gains are expected to moderate somewhat
as the impact of the Asian economic crisis reaches California
shores, the San Francisco Bay area's real estate market will remain
strong as equity-rich homeowners trade up to bigger homes,'' said
Tim Corliss, the association president, said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   These statistics from John McInerney, managing broker of the
95-broker office of TRI/Coldwell Banker Real Estate in San
Francisco, neatly illustrate the real estate phenomenon:
</P>
<P>
   There were 65 San Francisco home sales in the first six months
of the year at prices in excess of $1 million each. And for the
past four months, McInerney said, 50 percent of San Francisco
listings sell above the asking price.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of this has to do with our multifaceted economy _
healthy in all sectors,'' McInerney said. ``There is a large influx
of people to satisfy the new jobs and more competition for housing.
... We live in a very wealthy area, so people bid up.''
</P>
<P>
   The June price rise is consistent with the double-digit
year-on-year increases reported monthly for the past two years,
ranging from 12 to 20 percent, said G.U. Krueger, deputy chief
economist for the California Association of Realtors.
</P>
<P>
   Buyers may be comforted by the fact the June-to-June increase
was not as sharp as the increase between May 1988 and May 1989,
when it was 36 percent. However, Krueger said, economic conditions
were remarkably similar then and now.
</P>
<P>
   Although 1989 was followed by a recession, economists today
believe the near future may bring only an economic slowdown.
</P>
<P>
   The California Association of Realtors also found that the
number of days it took to sell a single-family home in the San
Francisco Bay area had declined to 27 days in June 1998 from 35
days in June 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The median prices in the area and the year-on-year increases
are:
</P>
<P>
   Alameda County, $267,020, up 15.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Contra Costa County, $357,200, up 5.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Marin County, $429,410, up 11.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Solano County, $157,080, up 16.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco County, $332,430, up 16.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   San Mateo County, $449,500, up 13.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Santa Clara County, $383,870, up 20.4 percent.

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Two weeks ago, the Lincoln Center Festival presented
the early-music group Sequentia in a production of Hildegard of
Bingen's ``Ordo Virtutum,'' or ``The Play of the Virtues.''
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday night the piece was repeated in the Clark Studio
Theater at Lincoln Center, again under festival auspices, by a
quartet of downtown composers calling themselves, for the occasion,
the Hildegurls.
</P>
<P>
   Not many people would need to see a 12th-century morality play
twice in a month _ or, indeed, in a lifetime _ but for those in the
audience who were doing the Hildegard double, the Hildegurls'
``Electronic Ordo Virtutum'' certainly looked different.
</P>
<P>
   Where the Sequentia production was stiff and pretentious, the
Hildegurls were fluid and direct. Their unmatching combinations of
pants and skirts gave them a faintly Indian look, and if the
uniform white suggested innocence, it was an assertive innocence.
</P>
<P>
   These were Virtues who knew about Hell. They were at its rim.
Red light and smoke belched up from a hole at the center of the
platforms on which they walked, platforms chalked with the names of
the Virtues: Victory, Modesty, Hope, Fear of God and so on.
</P>
<P>
   Under the direction of Grethe Barrett Holby, they came up with
some striking stage images. In the first scene, Lisa Bielawa as the
straying Soul was tied standing to the floor, then Kitty Brazelton
sat down in a corner to play a scarlet recorder.
</P>
<P>
   In the second scene, the Virtues' bold statements about
themselves were sung by recorded voices while strong beams of light
shined down on each of their names in turn. And in the third scene,
Eve Beglarian, who now took the role of the Soul, gave a powerful
impression of remorse.
</P>
<P>
   If the music had been as strong, fresh and unabashed as the
staging, all would have been well. But unfortunately, the
Hildegurls limited their opportunities _ binding themselves as
firmly as Ms. Bielawa _ by preserving the original chant, which was
cut and simplified but present all through.
</P>
<P>
   It soon became odd to see these vivid contemporary people
sweetly singing ancient chant, albeit into microphones. And the
discrepancy did not communicate anything very interesting.
Occasionally the Hildegurls went in for raw tone or close harmony,
and the whole final scene, where Elaine Kaplinsky was in charge,
had a quasi-rock sound. But there was altogether too much respect.
</P>
<P>
   The electronic music, created by a different Hildegurl for each
of the four scenes, was generally a background wash. It could have
been more. If the Hildegurls had gone a lot further in recomposing
the chant and in creating extensions, transformations and
counterpoints by means of their sound system, this could have been
a real musical adventure.
</P>
<P>
   There are performances Friday night and Saturday evening.

press frowned, whining about an utter compromise of ``musical
integrity.'' Never mind that Eubanks _ a fine guitarist whose 1988
album ``Shadow Prophets'' was ``Radio and Records''' top
contemporary jazz album of the year _ has always found that a
moralistic attitude toward his art results in creative limitations
he refuses to accept. So you can imagine jazz purists dropping dead

 BY IVOR DAVIS  (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Even before Frank Sinatra died, his Rat Pack was making a
comeback.
 &HT;    The time was ripe. Youngsters, eons too young to identify with
the jug-earred, thin-as-a-pool-cue, saloon singer of the 1940s, are
swinging to big band music in bars where they serve martinis and
Manhattans, and wear '40s fashions.
 &HT;    Now Martin Scorcese is teaming up with screenwriter Nick Pileggi
to film Nick Toesche's book about the Rat Pack's Dean Martin, with
Tom Hanks as Martin. HBO in August unveils its Rat Pack story with
Ray Liotta as Frank, Don Cheadle as Sammy Davis Jr., Angus
MacFadyen as Peter Lawford and Joe Mantegna as Dino. AMC will
screen the clan's l964 romp, ``Robin and the Seven Hoods,'' on July
29th.
 &HT;    And two recent books, ``Rat Pack Confidential,'' by Shawn Levy,
and ``The Rat Pack - the Hey Hey Days of Frank and the Boys,'' by
Lawrence J. Quirk and William Schoell, went behind the scenes from
Hoboken, N.J., to Las Vegas, from the White House to Hollywood to
lay out the pack's good, bad and the ugly.
 &HT;    Of course Frank's death is sure to give these projects an added
boost. Not that they need it. A few weeks before Sinatra died in
May, the cable channel TV Land scored its highest ever rating with
the benefit concert the pack filmed in St. Louis in 1965 for a
halfway home for ex-cons. Viewers sat mesmerized as Johnny Carson,
substituting for Pack member Joey Bishop, struggled to mimic his
savoir faire.
 &HT;    In all of the stories, Sinatra is the leader. The rest were
along for the party at Frank's command. Only Frank could command
their appearance at a tip of his fedora.
 &HT;    When the original pack, the coterie of pals who hung around
Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall, faded after Bogart's death,
Sinatra, the most junior member of the group, reformed it with his
buddies: Dino, Sammy, Lawford, Bishop and Shirley MacLaine, the
only woman allowed.
 &HT;    So why did the country virtually come to a halt when Frank died?
Why, in spite of what we know about Mafia connections, his boorish
actions to those who he felt slighted him, political toadying to
the Kennedys, and later to his crony Spiro Agnew, do we glory in
his behavior and thrill to his pals' perpetually juvenile banter?
 &HT;    Levy, author of ``The Rat Pack,'' thinks he knows why.
 &HT;    ``This was the last group of pop culture stars who were
grown-ups,'' he explains. ``Dylan wasn't, the Beatles weren't,
Jerry Garcia wasn't a grown-up. Sinatra and pals, whatever else
they were, were grown-ups. They smoked and they drank and they went
with beautiful women. It was the last stage before the teen culture
took over.''
 &HT;    It's no wonder their act, a paen to unapologetic masculinity,
appeals at a time when the ``new man'' seems to constantly be
apologizing for brutishness. To hear the pack today doing their
thing on stage is to go back to an era before political
correctness.
 &HT;    ``I'd like to thank the NAACP for this wonderful trophy,'' said
Martin in St. Louis, picking up Davis, carrying him on stage. They
got away with it because we knew this was the most unprejudiced
group in the country.
 &HT;    Like Sinatra, most were a mass of contradictions, except Dean
who didn't give a damn, and therefore was the coolest. Sammy was a
dynamo of raw talent who cared desperately about the slights he had
to endure because of his race, yet who constantly demeaned himself
as the price of admission.
 &HT;    Lawford was the epitome of the aristocractic English gentleman
and brother-in-law of the president, but underneath a degenerate
who ended up face down in a pool of booze and drugs.
 &HT;    But the greatest contradiction was Frank himself -- who wouldn't
swear in the company of a woman and was always first to light her
cigarette, but who could vilify a female journalist with language a
gutter fighter would have hesitated to use. He was generous to a
fault, giving millions of dollars a year to worthy causes and
individuals, yet could be as mean and vindictive as hoods whose
company he apparently enjoyed. He was progressive politically, a
champion of the working man who had been in the forefront on civil
rights and ended up buddies with Agnew.
 &HT;    ``He was a lonely man,'' says Levy. ``Those lonely ballads have
something very sincere about them. He was an only child, which
considering he was an Italian-American of World War I vintage, was
very unusual. He hated to be alone. He had the big band entourage
around him in the '40s. He lost everything in the '50s and then
when he got back on top he needed a bunch of guys to hang out
with.''
 &HT;    These guys made it look as if they were hosts of the greatest
party anywhere.
 &HT;    ``They were the Woodstock of the cocktail era with great women,
stars, the glamour, the danger of Vegas, the cavorting into the wee
hours, the ribbing of friends,'' says Levy.
 &HT;    But underneath was something more dangerous, less cool.
 &HT;    ``Like every golden age,'' says Levy, ``It's only golden in
retrospect. I've tried to remind people what was happening under
the veneer... the mob connections, and the fact that together the
work they produced was mediocre - films like `Oceans Eleven,'
`Sergeants 3' and `Robin and the Seven Hoods.' And the live
recordings that trickled out from them are not their best work.''
 &HT;    But then Sinatra could go off by himself and produce genius.
 &HT;    ``I continue to be amazed by the vastness of his ability to hold
contradictory impulses and ideas, '' says Levy, ``to
compartmentalize his personal life and his public cavorting. His
politics are over here... his music over there. The morning after
some outrageous event ... he goes into a recording studio for some
of the most beautiful ballad singing ever. I don't understand the
greatness of spirit that takes ... He could walk into the studio
and turn off everything except the music.''
 &HT;    The Pack may have been a passing phenomenon, not so Sinatra,
says Levy.
 &HT;    ``This is one of the great lives of the twentieth century. He
produced inaugural galas for both Kennedy and then decades later
for Reagan. He was recording well into his seventies and not
revivals - new material.''
 &HT;    And the bad Sinatra, who beat up people, acted like a dictator,
who introduced mobster Sam Giancana to John F. Kennedy Jr., how
does that even the legend?
 &HT;    Not at all says Levy. ``Listen, Picasso was a creep with women.
It doesn't matter if James Joyce and Beethoven were wretches. It
makes their art more impressive that they can lock out the
personal.''

they were, were grown-ups. They smoked and they drank and they went
with beautiful women. It was the last stage before the teen culture
took over.''
 &HT;    It's no wonder their act, a paen to unapologetic masculinity,
appeals at a time when the ``new man'' seems to constantly be
apologizing for brutishness. To hear the pack today doing their
thing on stage is to go back to an era before political
correctness.
 &HT;    ``I'd like to thank the NAACP for this wonderful trophy,'' said
Martin in St. Louis, picking up Davis, carrying him on stage. They
got away with it because we knew this was the most unprejudiced
group in the country.
 &HT;    Like Sinatra, most were a mass of contradictions, except Dean
who didn't give a damn, and therefore was the coolest. Sammy was a
dynamo of raw talent who cared desperately about the slights he had
to endure because of his race, yet who constantly demeaned himself
as the price of admission.
 &HT;    Lawford was the epitome of the aristocractic English gentleman
and brother-in-law of the president, but underneath a degenerate
who ended up face down in a pool of booze and drugs.
 &HT;    But the greatest contradiction was Frank himself -- who wouldn't
swear in the company of a woman and was always first to light her
cigarette, but who could vilify a female journalist with language a
gutter fighter would have hesitated to use. He was generous to a
fault, giving millions of dollars a year to worthy causes and
individuals, yet could be as mean and vindictive as hoods whose
company he apparently enjoyed. He was progressive politically, a
champion of the working man who had been in the forefront on civil
rights and ended up buddies with Agnew.
 &HT;    ``He was a lonely man,'' says Levy. ``Those lonely ballads have
something very sincere about them. He was an only child, which
considering he was an Italian-American of World War I vintage, was
very unusual. He hated to be alone. He had the big band entourage
around him in the '40s. He lost everything in the '50s and then
when he got back on top he needed a bunch of guys to hang out
with.''
 &HT;    These guys made it look as if they were hosts of the greatest
party anywhere.
 &HT;    ``They were the Woodstock of the cocktail era with great women,
stars, the glamour, the danger of Vegas, the cavorting into the wee
hours, the ribbing of friends,'' says Levy.
 &HT;    But underneath was something more dangerous, less cool.
 &HT;    ``Like every golden age,'' says Levy, ``It's only golden in
retrospect. I've tried to remind people what was happening under
the veneer... the mob connections, and the fact that together the
work they produced was mediocre - films like `Oceans Eleven,'
`Sergeants 3' and `Robin and the Seven Hoods.' And the live
recordings that trickled out from them are not their best work.''
 &HT;    But then Sinatra could go off by himself and produce genius.
 &HT;    ``I continue to be amazed by the vastness of his ability to hold
contradictory impulses and ideas, '' says Levy, ``to
compartmentalize his personal life and his public cavorting. His
politics are over here... his music over there. The morning after
some outrageous event ... he goes into a recording studio for some
of the most beautiful ballad singing ever. I don't understand the
greatness of spirit that takes ... He could walk into the studio
and turn off everything except the music.''
 &HT;    The Pack may have been a passing phenomenon, not so Sinatra,
says Levy.
 &HT;    ``This is one of the great lives of the twentieth century. He
produced inaugural galas for both Kennedy and then decades later
for Reagan. He was recording well into his seventies and not
revivals - new material.''
 &HT;    And the bad Sinatra, who beat up people, acted like a dictator,
who introduced mobster Sam Giancana to John F. Kennedy Jr., how
does that even the legend?
 &HT;    Not at all says Levy. ``Listen, Picasso was a creep with women.
It doesn't matter if James Joyce and Beethoven were wretches. It
makes their art more impressive that they can lock out the
personal.''

`DISTURBING BEHAVIOR': YOUNG GOODY-TWO-SHOES WHO BASICALLY LACK
SOULS 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: Production notes appear at the end of the review.) 
(th) 
 By STEPHEN HOLDEN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   There's something awfully creepy about the Blue Ribbons, a
clique of letter-sweater-wearing, bake-sale-sponsoring teen-agers
whose numbers are rapidly increasing at Cradle Bay High School,
somewhere in the Pacific Northwest.
</P>
<P>
   Under the tutelage of a messianic guidance counselor named Dr.
Caldicott (Bruce Greenwood), these robotically well-mannered
goody-goods who soak up vintage Barry Manilow and Olivia
Newton-John records in Cradle Bay's Yogurt Shoppe are on a sinister
mission to drain all the juice from American teen-age life.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately for everyone, these adolescent cousins of ``The
Stepford Wives'' aren't the perfectly finished products of modern
neurosurgery that their leader would like them to be. It's their
hormones, you see.
</P>
<P>
   When sexually stimulated, no amount of programming can prevent
these perky model citizens from going momentarily berserk with lust
and rage, after which they lapse back into a glassy-eyed docility.
</P>
<P>
   ``Disturbing Behavior,'' in which Steve (James Marsden), the
cute new boy in town, finds himself at first wooed and then coerced
into Blue Ribbon membership, could have worked as an eerie fable
about teen-age identity and social stratification in the age of
Prozac had its creators (the director David Nutter and the
screenwriter Scott Rosenberg) taken the premise seriously.
</P>
<P>
   But this mess of a movie, which crudely stirs together elements
of ``The Stepford Wives,'' ``A Clockwork Orange'' and ``Village of
the Damned,'' gives the game away in its opening scene in which a
sexually aroused Blue Ribbon boy beats his date to death in a
parked car.
</P>
<P>
   Every time a laser beam begins shooting out of a character's
eye, ``Disturbing Behavior'' sinks a notch further away from hip
satire into cheap horror. The movie takes a turn toward the trashy
when Steve and his girlfriend Rachel (Katie Holmes) sneak into a
local mental hospital that is a 19th-century snake pit of iron
doors and screeching lunatics.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, it's discovered that a noise machine invented to
flush out rats from their hiding places has the power to drive the
Blue Ribbons mad. From this point on, ``Disturbing Behavior'' is a
paint-by-numbers creep show that can't muster enough energy to be
the tiniest bit scary.
</P>
<P>
   The movie is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or
adult guardian). It has sexual situations and some gory violence.
</P>

   How Big a Race For the DVD?
</P>
<P>
   Purveyors of digital video disks and players report steady sales
growth this summer. What's needed now, they say, is a burst of
acceleration to establish the format. Distributors describe
themselves as being in a race. Will enough people be firmly in the
habit of buying and renting the disks before rival technologies
arrive with their own ways of ordering movies?
</P>
<P>
   At present, 450,000 to 500,000 DVD players are said to have been
bought by consumers. Some DVD industry advocates hold that 10
million players need to be sold in the next three to five years if
the disks are to have the momentum necessary to keep people going
to stores for a new breed of packaged goods when they might stay at
home and resort to a less time-consuming form of delivery _ digital
satellite, for example, or digital cable or the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   But others in the business don't see the deadline as being quite
that defined or dire. Michael Fidler, who manages DVD marketing for
Sony, said that other applications of the disk _ for example, its
nonmovie uses with personal computers or its portability as a CD _
insured its staying power beyond movies.
</P>
<P>
   That might allow more breathing room to establish DVD as a movie
format, not that distributors are wasting any time. ``We're seeing
an extension of infrastructure,'' Fidler said. That's marketing
executive talk for price reductions of disks (to as low as $15 in
some cases) and players (to the $400 level for some machines) and
an increase in the number of stores carrying DVD.
</P>
<P>
   `Avengers' Revisited
</P>
<P>
   In 1966, ``The Avengers'' became the first British television
show to be shown coast to coast by an American network (ABC). By
then the stars, Patrick Macnee and Diana Rigg, had barnstormed the
country to introduce themselves. Ms. Rigg, who was to become
virtually immortal as Emma Peel, the gorgeous, self-reliant
colleague of secret agent John Steed (Macnee), raised eyebrows in a
miniskirt that was daringly brief for the era. ``It was looked on
with horror,'' said Macnee, 76.
</P>
<P>
   But people were curious about the show, which was a hit in
England. ``I told them it was about a man in a bowler hat with an
umbrella and a woman who throws men over her shoulder,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, A&AMP;E will release two boxed sets of the series, with two
episodes on each of six cassettes.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Rigg, who turned 60 this week, joined the show two seasons
before it came to the United States and left it in 1967. With its
mix of elegance, witty sang-froid, sedate violence, mildly kinky
sexual references and inalterably British manner, ``The Avengers''
became hugely popular here as the original tongue-in-cheek spy
show.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Americans had to tinker. ``After the first season, a
young man with sweaty palms and a nasty attitude was sent from the
United States to, as he put it, `slightly adapt the show for
American tastes,''' Macnee said.
</P>
<P>
   That meant purging or toning down sexual content, which on
occasion included some good-natured ``perversity,'' as Macnee
called it. ``Someone dressed up in rubber or leather,'' he said.
``Tie them to the bedpost. We showed you could have some fun doing
it.''

`WESTERN': OUT ON FOOT IN FRANCE IN SEARCH OF WOMEN 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By JANET MASLIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   (italics)``Western'' was shown as part of this year's New
Directors/New Films series. Following are excerpts from Janet
Maslin's review, which appeared in The New York Times on March 27.
The film _ in French, with English subtitles _ opens Friday in
Manhattan.(end italics) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The sly, delightful ``Western,'' a peacefully scenic Cinemascope
film that won the Cannes Film Festival's Jury Prize last year,
begins when a traveling shoe salesman named Paco (Sergi Lopez) is
conned into picking up a hitchhiker named Nino (Sacha Bourdo), who
looks like a runty, hapless version of the young Bob Dylan.
</P>
<P>
   They make awkward small talk. Then the car breaks down, and
somehow Nino manages to steal it, only to be caught and clobbered
not long afterward by Paco in a picturesque coastal town. ``You
know, stealing cars is not in my philosophy,'' Nino explains when
Paco subsequently visits him in the hospital. To account for the
heist, he says, ``Something got into me when I saw all those
shoes.''
</P>
<P>
   It happens that while Paco was stranded, he met and quickly fell
in love with Marinette (Elisabeth Vitali), who runs the local gift
shop. And that Marinette wants to give the sudden romance a
three-week rest. So for lack of any better plans, Paco and Nino set
out on a trip through the countryside.
</P>
<P>
   Before long, they are forging a friendship based on the most
unexpected details, like the fact that each knows how to walk on
his hands.
</P>
<P>
   It was crayfish for dinner when Paco was wooing Marinette, but
now he and Nino enter their spaghetti days. Traveling on foot,
staying wherever anyone will have them, they share a wonderful
journey.
</P>
<P>
   Paco turns out to be Spanish, while Nino came from Russia, and
the two are united by their feelings of loneliness in France. At an
especially charming juncture in the story, they meet a disabled
African who feels similarly estranged and who teaches them a game
he calls ``Bonjour la France.''
</P>
<P>
   The idea is to sit in a cafe and greet passers-by, collecting
points if they answer. A man is worth one point, a woman two, a
couple three. No points are scored when the stranger yells, ``Go
back where you belong!''
</P>
<P>
   The director, Manuel Poirier, born in Peru and living in
Normandy, knows all about that game and all about Paco and Nino's
longings. So, of course, the filmmaker and Jean-Francois Goyet,
with whom he wrote the screenplay, send them in search of women.
Far from predatory, the two men are almost childlike in their
ingenuous scheming.
</P>
<P>
   It's touching to find that good-looking Paco, who draws women
away from Nino without meaning to, wants so much to help his new
friend. ``You see that town?'' he says, pointing to a
postcard-pretty village in the distance. ``I'm sure in that town
there has to be a woman for you.'' And since France is full of such
towns, he adds helpfully, ``the potential is enormous.''
</P>
<P>
   Brainstorm: The two will canvass the ladies of the town with a
fake questionnaire. ``Does your ideal man have to be French?'' Paco
asks, dreaming up one question. (Another is: ``Do you like a man
who shows philosophy in his life?'') ``That's damn good,'' Nino
assures him.
</P>
<P>
   It is, too. After all its comic misadventures, ``Western'' finds
one of the men so unexpectedly lucky in love that his good fortune
brings tears to his eyes. And Poirier, whose laconically funny
timing often brings to mind Jim Jarmusch's deadpan style, need not
compromise his film's amusing diffidence to let ``Western'' warm
the heart.

NIGHTMARE AHEAD: TRAFFIC CONGESTION IN BAY AREA TO GROW 250 PERCENT
BY 2020 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ANASTASIA HENDRIX  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Yes, it can get worse. And it will. Traffic
congestion in the San Francisco Bay area is expected to increase
nearly 250 percent by 2020.
</P>
<P>
   In two decades, commuters can expect 366,000 hours of collective
daily delays, compared with the 105,000 hours they waited on any
given day in 1990, according to a Metropolitan Transportation
Commission report forecasting the future of regional freeways in
the nine-county Bay area.
</P>
<P>
   ``What it points out is that even as we make the improvements
that are planned _ which are significant _ the congestion problem
won't be solved, so we have to look at alternatives,'' said
Michelle Morris Brubaker, an commission planner who helped
calculate the predictions.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, the computer-generated data also indicated
that in the future fewer people will be willing to spend more time
idling in bumper-to-bumper conditions.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have a threshold of just how much congestion they are
willing to take before they inevitably move closer to work or do
something to avoid it altogether,'' Brubaker said.
</P>
<P>
   Oakland resident Nouri Akli, who works for Pacific Bell in San
Francisco, sees himself as a prime candidate for that kind of
change if the traffic gets as bad as anticipated.
</P>
<P>
   ``If that's the case, then I will probably start looking to
transfer to the East Bay so I don't have to commute,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now it takes 45 minutes to get to work, when it only
takes 15 minutes without congestion,'' he said. ``If it increases
even more, that will definitely cross my threshold.''
</P>
<P>
   The 88-page draft report details how the commission's $88
billion projected budget will be divided among the region's 7,000
miles of transit, 1,700 miles of highways and 18,000 miles of
streets and roads.
</P>
<P>
   It emphasizes using the majority of future state and federal
funding to maintain the systems in place, and the rest to improve
public transportation.

`THE DECALOGUE': MODERN MORALITY TALES FROM A MASTER POLISH
FILMMAKER 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: ``The Decalogue'' was first shown at New York's Walter Reade
Theater in 1996. The following review appeared in The New York
Times on March 8, 1996.) 
(js) 
 By STEPHEN HOLDEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It would be a mistake to think of ``The Decalogue,''
Krzysztof Kieslowski's dramatic series of made-for-television films
inspired by the Ten Commandments, as cinematic interpretations of
biblical teaching. These 10 hour-long movies are elliptical stories
that draw no easy moral conclusions.
</P>
<P>
   Like the great Polish director's full-length features, they are
obsessed with the elements of chance and fate in modern life. Of
``The Decalogue,'' the director himself has said, ``I simply wanted
to show that life is complicated ... nothing more,'' adding that
the series' only message is to ``live carefully, with your eyes
open, and try not to cause pain.''
</P>
<P>
   And yet there are stronger moral reverberations in many of these
10 movies than in Kieslowski's other recent work. The first film is
the tragic tale of a brilliant, computer-wise 11-year-old. The boy
drowns when he ventures out onto ice that his father's computer
calculations have shown to be thick enough to hold him. The story
goes out of its way to make a point that the father, a lecturer on
linguistics, is not religious. The movie could be read as a
cautionary fable about a world that places too much faith in
technology while losing touch with a deeper, more intuitive
spiritual connection with nature.
</P>
<P>
   In the second story, a pregnant concert violinist, whose husband
is near death from an unidentified illness, is revealed to be
carrying the child of her lover. Depending upon a doctor's
prognosis, she must decide whether to have an abortion. Again, the
story finds people asking for clear-cut scientific answers to
problems that can't be neatly quantified.
</P>
<P>
   All 10 stories are set in a Warsaw housing development that is
as drab as it is expansive. Each film is a self-contained story
with a different cast. Besides the setting, the only common element
is the appearance of a stranger at the climax of each story.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Decalogue'' shows Kieslowski to be a modern filmmaker of a
stature comparable to Ingmar Bergman. If Kieslowski's films are as
serious as Bergman's, their lack of psychologizing lends them a
deceptive weightlessness. The characters often find themselves
existing in a moral void that for all its creature comforts doesn't
feel right. These uneasy people are tempted, despite themselves, to
decipher answers from the seemingly random events that determine
their lives. And maybe, the director implies, they are right to do
so.
</P>
<P>
   The 10 films, each lasting from 53 to 57 minutes, will play at
the Walter Reade Theater, at Lincoln Center, 165 West 65th St.,
Friday through Thursday. Schedule information: (212) 875-5600.

ART NOTES: SELLING ICONS OF MODERN ART 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By CAROL VOGEL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   While much of the art world slows down in the summer, for
auction house experts it's one of the busiest times of the year.
July and August are when they travel the world, trying to get
property to sell for the big auctions in November. And when a house
obtains an important collection to sell, it is generally announced
as soon as possible to encourage other sellers to follow.
</P>
<P>
   This week, Sotheby's got the goods. It will be selling seven
works with an estimated value of $13.5 million that belong to the
Boston collectors Mildred and Herbert Lee.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Lee had an eye and taste ahead of her time. In the early
1960s, she began buying contemporary and modern art, collecting
iconic images of the period by artists like Warhol, Robert
Rauschenberg and Jasper Johns.
</P>
<P>
   One of those images is Johns' ``White Numbers,'' from 1958. It
is among the rarest of works in the collection that Sotheby's will
sell this fall. The artist executed three ``White Numbers.'' One
belonged to the New York collectors Victor and Sally Ganz, and was
sold at Christie's last year for $7.9 million. The other is in the
Ludwig Museum in Cologne, Germany.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Lee bought her ``White Numbers'' in 1962 and since then, it
has been off the market. Sotheby's experts estimate it will sell
for between $7 million and $9 million.
</P>
<P>
   Also for sale will be Picasso's ``Head of a Woman,'' a portrait
of Francoise Gilot, one of the artist's companions, which he
painted in 1952. It is a prime example of Picasso's deconstructed
heads in vibrant colors, and is bordered by thick black bands that
create an effect of stained glass. It carries an estimate of $2
million to $3 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both these works are about surface and texture,'' said Tobias
Meyer, head of Sotheby's department of contemporary art worldwide.
``They're very sensual.''
</P>
<P>
   Meyer described the collection as quintessentially American and
very personal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mrs. Lee was one of the earliest Johns collectors,'' he added.
``In fact, all these works have great provenances.''
</P>
<P>
   Mr. and Mrs. Lee are not the only family members who collect
important contemporary art. Their son Thomas H. Lee, a
leveraged-buyout specialist, has been a big spender at auctions for
years. He is also a trustee of the Whitney Museum of American Art
and last year, when he gave the museum a lot of money, he asked
that its two-floor galleries be named after his parents.
</P>
<P>
   When asked why they decided to sell part of their collection,
Mr. Lee, 83, and Mrs. Lee, 78, would say only that it was a family
decision.
</P>
<P>
   Everyday and Someday
</P>
<P>
   There's lots of biennale news this week, from Australia as well
as Italy. First, about the Sydney Biennale, which is scheduled to
run from Sept. 18 through Nov. 8.
</P>
<P>
   Now in its 25th year, this international exhibition of
contemporary art will include 103 artists from 28 countries. The
theme, ``Every Day,'' was chosen to reflect the fact that artists
are increasingly looking closer to home for inspiration, said
Jonathan Watkins, artistic director for the Biennale. He was in New
York this week to announce his plans.
</P>
<P>
   Watkins said this year's biennale was by far the most expansive.
Rather than being held at its regular sites, the Art Gallery of New
South Wales and the Museum of Contemporary Art, it will be in about
10 different venues around Sydney. There will also be site-specific
installations at the Sydney Opera House, the Royal Botanic Gardens
and the grounds of the government House.
</P>
<P>
   As for the Venice Biennale, officials there say they still do
not know whether the next Biennale will be presented as scheduled
in 1999, or in 2000. But the Biennale's administration has named a
director for the visual arts Biennale _ Harold Szeemann, a
65-year-old curator and art historian who was the director of
``Documenta 5'' in Kassel, Germany, in 1972.
</P>
<P>
   Szeemann was also a co-organizer of the Venice Biennale in 1980,
and an originator of the Aperto exhibitions, which show younger
artists at the Venice Biennale.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1981, Szeemann has lived in Switzerland and been an
independent curator. He is replacing Germano Celant, an Italian
critic and part-time curator at the Guggenheim Museum, who ran the
visual-arts Venice Biennale in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   On the Move to Chelsea
</P>
<P>
   Two well-known Soho galleries, Jay Gorney Modern Art and Bravin
Post Lee, are joining forces and heading to Manhattan's Chelsea.
</P>
<P>
   Jay Gorney has just closed his space on Greene Street; Bravin
Post Lee closed its Mercer Street gallery last year. The two
companies will become Gorney Bravin &AMP; Lee, combining the last names
of its principals, Gorney, Karin Bravin and John Post Lee. While
they are currently working in temporary quarters on Broome Street,
they said they were close to finding a Chelsea location.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first we talked about sharing a space but then it seemed
like there was more energy and power in joining forces,'' Gorney
said. ``I bring a stable of well-known artists like Gillian
Wearing, Lari Pittman, Jessica Stockholder and Alexis Rockman, and
they bring artists like Fabian Marcaccio and Emil Lukas.''
</P>
<P>
   Both galleries sold their Soho leases. Now the owners say they
feel committed to Chelsea.
</P>
<P>
   ``We see everyone moving to Chelsea,'' Gorney said. ``Part of my
soul rebels, but Chelsea just seems to make sense.''
</P>
<P>
   Renovation in London
</P>
<P>
   Although the Victoria and Albert Museum in London is one of the
last of the big museums to receive significant lottery money, the
$25 million the decorative arts museum was awarded this week from
the Heritage Lottery Fund will mean it can completely rethink and
renovate its famed British galleries.
</P>
<P>
   The galleries, which take up about 10 percent of the museum's
exhibition space, span British design from 1500 through 1900 and
include its much-loved period rooms.
</P>
<P>
   The project will cost a total of $51.7 million, and the museum
is busy getting corporate and private financing to pay for the
rest. So far it has raised about $5 million.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Are we ready for this?
</P>
<P>
   Now that the outgoing head of the Justice Department's probe
into campaign finance abuses has recommended that yet another
independent counsel be authorized to pursue the extent of White
House involvement, Attorney General Janet Reno is once again on the
hot seat.
</P>
<P>
   She has resisted Republican demands for an outside probe of 1996
Democratic campaign fund-raising tactics since the scandal broke
nearly two years ago, insisting that her department can handle the
issue satisfactorily. She stubbornly reiterated that position again
earlier this month in testimony before a Senate committee.
</P>
<P>
   The political pressure on her to capitulate escalated
dramatically when the department's own campaign finance prosecutor,
Charles LaBella, joined FBI Director Louis Freeh in urging that
Justice back off and turn the issue over to a court-appointed
investigator. Both believe that the department has an appearance of
conflict of interest, since the purpose of most of the alleged
illegal contributions was to re-elect Reno's boss.
</P>
<P>
   Reno, who is no Clinton crony, resents the assumption that she
cannot be trusted to enforce the law. She has, after all, already
authorized no less than seven independent counsels to probe charges
against the president, Cabinet officers and other high-ranking
officials. And she gave Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr approval
to look beyond Whitewater into the Monica Lewinsky mess.
</P>
<P>
   Reno said she would review LaBella's recommendation.
</P>
<P>
   But does America really need another uncontrolled, ambitious
Starr clone with unlimited funds, time and subpoena power but no
sense of judicial proportion? Enough already.
</P>
<P>
   What's so magical about a special counsel anyway? Let's stop
being academic about ethical purity and get real here.
</P>
<P>
   Starr has made a joke of the original notion that an independent
counsel would automatically pursue allegations of wrongdoing in
high places in a nonpartisan, judicious manner. His vindictive
behavior (the endless prosecution of Susan McDougal, for instance)
and cozy relations with anti-Clinton conservatives long ago
stripped away any pretense of impartiality and fair-mindedness.
</P>
<P>
   And just what horror is this new deus ex machina supposed to
investigate at taxpayer expense?
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department inquiry has so far produced indictments
of 11 fund-raisers or donors who were not affiliated directly with
the White House and whose names are not household words. The
Democratic National Committee returned roughly $3 million in
contributions of dubious legality. But the scandal has not brought
down any important White House official.
</P>
<P>
   A Senate committee investigated Democratic campaign fund-raising
practices but disbanded without proving its most damning charges
that foreign contributors actually influenced the election. A
similar House committee collapsed under partisan wrangling.
</P>
<P>
   The GOP-controlled Congress has kept the focus on Democratic
fund-raising, but there is plenty of evidence that the Republicans
were not pure in their fund-raising methods either. The hypocrisy
level of this scandal is in the stratosphere.
</P>
<P>
   And if Congress is outraged over excesses in campaign
fund-raising, it is a big fat secret. Reform of the system is
stalled in both houses. Voters don't much care, either, telling
pollsters campaign finance reform doesn't have a high priority with
them.
</P>
<P>
   So what is the big deal about naming a special counsel? The goal
seems more to be about harassing President Clinton and Vice
President Al Gore going into a new presidential election season
than about seeking the truth behind the bipartisan selling of our
political soul.
</P>
<P>
   The basic unanswered issue is whether Clinton, Gore and their
top advisers conspired to take illegal contributions or were
unaware of their improper origins, as they insist. And Republicans
would like to hassle Clinton and Gore some more about fund-raising
coffees, Buddhist monks and phone calls from the White House that
may have violated the spirit of the law if not its substance.
</P>
<P>
   The subpoena power of another special counsel to rummage in
White House documents and interrogate White House officials to
examine campaign finances tops the Republican wish list. Having
watched the wreckage of Starr's rampage, Reno would be a fool to
grant it.
</P>
<P>
   From what we know thus far, the targeted wrongs here are mostly
small potatoes. The real scandal is the bipartisan pattern of
raising campaign money by promising not only access to leaders but
political favors, which neither party has the will to change. In
particular, this practice would be horrific if a foreign country,
say China, benefited at the expense of our national security.
</P>
<P>
   But public figures know how to manipulate what they are doing
and saying so that bribery is virtually impossible to prove. There
are so many entangling relationships among donors, politicians,
lobbyists and workerbees that it is difficult to separate
legitimate contributions from prosecutable paybacks.
</P>
<P>
   There may yet be something serious that can be uncovered in the
1996 Democratic fund-raising scramble, which looks reckless in the
extreme. But the Justice Department is qualified to pursue whatever
trails there may be, and Reno is right to be outraged at
suggestions that she cannot be trusted to do her job honorably.
</P>
<P>
   Republican National Committee Chairman Jim Nicholson, not
exactly an unbiased observer, demanded that she bow to the
lower-ranking LaBella, contending she owes her loyalty to ``the
rule of law, not the men who appointed her.'' What an insult to a
woman of great integrity.
</P>
<P>
   As for the special counsel law, it expires next year and should
not be renewed in anything remotely resembling its present
unaccountable form, if at all.

 &HT;    SENATORS: COMPUTER BUG POSES HEALTH CARE CRISIS
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The nation's health care industry has fallen victim
to the millennium bug syndrome _ with no quick cure in sight.
</P>
<P>
   That was the diagnosis reached on Thursday by Sen. Bob Bennett,
R-Utah, who chairs a special Senate panel on the Year 2000 computer
glitch. As Bennett sees it: ``If tonight when the clock strikes
midnight the calendar flipped to Dec. 31, 1999, large portions of
the health care system would fail.''
</P>
<P>
   His views were echoed by Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., who
said what people really want to know is whether ``people are going
to die as a result of Year 2000 complications in the medical
industry?''
</P>
<P>
   Dodd's answer: ``I don't think so. There's no need to put people
into a sense of panic. But it's entirely possible that millennium
conversion could put the health care industry into intensive
care.''
</P>
<P>
   Potential industry problems include the need to replace
thousands of kidney dialysis units, costing $14,000 apiece, that
will improperly shut down for maintenance when they are unable to
read the correct date. Similarly, there is concern about
malfunctioning computer-based scanners and patients' medical
records that become locked up or lost as systems fail.
</P>
<P>
   Rural and inner city hospitals and clinics are expected to be
especially hard-hit in light of their limited resources to finance
fixes.
</P>
<P>
   Among the key issues raised at the hearing:
</P>
<P>
   _ The Health Care Financing Administration, which pays Medicare
claims, admitted that it recently had to revise its estimate of its
bug-infested programs from 20 million to 49 million lines of
computer code after an outside contractor performed an audit. But
Nancy-Ann DeParle, the agency's administrator, said ``we are making
substantial progress in addressing the Year 2000 problem'' after
she had made it her ``top priority.''
</P>
<P>
   _ The Food and Drug Administration has achieved only a 10
percent response rate to its repeated inquiries to the makers of
medical devices seeking Year 2000 compliance data. But Michael
Friedman, the FDA acting chief, said that the data gathered so far
shows ``no indications that there will be significant problems
which will place patients at risk.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not reassuring,'' Dodd told Friedman, citing the low
response rate. ``I find that frightening. We've got to have the FDA
become a lot more aggressive about this.''
</P>
<P>
   Sharing the senators' concern, Jennifer Jackson, speaking for
the 5,000-member American Hospitals Association, called on Congress
to enact legislation that would force medical equipment makers to
impart information on whether their devices are Year 2000
compliant.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do not have the legislative or regulatory authority to
compel disclosure,'' Jackson noted.
</P>
<P>
   The American Medical Association also voiced its concern over
the threat the Year 2000 problem poses to patient care. A
spokesman, Donald Palmisano, called on Congress to work with the
health care industry to forge a uniform definition of Year 2000
``compliant'' with regard to medical devices.
</P>
<P>
   Facing a bevy of administration and industry witnesses in the
health field, Bennett and Dodd cast doubt on optimistic government
forecasts that a fix would be in place before their
mission-critical systems were put at risk.
</P>
<P>
   The senators also berated makers of biomedical devices for
having failed to set up a central clearing house where the data
needed to repair the problem could be processed.
</P>
<P>
   But Ramin Mojdeh, speaking for the Health Industry Manufacturers
Association, stressed the complexity of the problem, which came
about when programmers wrote software and designed chips that can't
decode dates in 2000 or beyond.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've found that the challenge posed by the Year 2000 bug
doesn't represent a single problem that will yield to a single
solution,'' Mojdeh said, because the sensitivity to the bug varies
dramatically among medical devices.
</P>
<P>
   The Medical Device Manufacturers Association, excluded from
testifying at the hearing, contended that the risk posed the Year
2000 problem has been ``overstated.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Computer technology is not a component of most medical devices
and the vast majority of medical equipment that does rely upon
computer hardware and software is not date-sensitive,'' the trade
group argued.
</P>
<P>
   The FDA has set up a web site,
www.fda.gov/cdrh/yr2000/year2000.html, that contains information on
products identified by their manufacturers as not being Year 2000
compliant as well as a list of those products said by their makers
to be unaffected by the problem.

LAWMAKERS FIGHT TO KEEP MILITARY WORK IN TEXAS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By SIG CHRISTENSON  
 c.1998 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ The Air Force has ordered Kelly Air Force Base to
start preparing to shift hundreds of jobs to a maintenance depot in
Utah, with some jobs moving in two months.
</P>
<P>
   A June 30 memo from the Air Force Materiel Command, which
oversees Kelly, orders base officials to ``please begin the early
move'' of the base's gas turbine engine workload to Hill Air Force
Base in Ogden, Utah, ``as soon as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Kelly spokesman Glen Whiton said none of the 600 or so
engine-maintenance jobs at the base had been transferred.
</P>
<P>
   But some will move to Utah in September, Hill spokesman Bruce
Collins said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Word of the Air Force's decision came as a blow to San Antonio
Mayor Howard Peak and others who have tried to keep the work in
Texas when Kelly closes in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm always disappointed, but unfortunately over time I have
ceased to be at least completely surprised'' by news about jobs
leaving Kelly, Peak said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``You win some, you lose some in these situations,'' said Rep.
Ciro Rodriguez, D-Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The future of Kelly's gas turbine engine work has been in
question for months as Rodriguez and others in Washington have
fought Air Force plans to move the work to Utah.
</P>
<P>
   At stake are several hundred jobs now at Kelly that are pegged
for transfer to Hill at the start of 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The Air Force has said that 290 maintenance jobs and 97
white-collar jobs likely will go to Utah. Collins said the number
of workers could rise as high as 600, with most of the workload
transfer to be complete as Kelly closes in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   The jobs have an average annual salary of $37,690, Whiton said.
</P>
<P>
   A bipartisan coalition of lawmakers led by Rodriguez and Sens.
Phil Gramm and Kay Bailey Hutchison, both Texas Republicans, has
sought to move the Kelly jobs to the Corpus Christi Army Depot.
</P>
<P>
   That would allow Kelly workers to follow the jobs and also save
taxpayer money, since Hill must spend about $4.6 million on new
construction to handle the engine workload, coalition members have
said.
</P>
<P>
   The coalition of Texas lawmakers has urged Deputy Defense
Secretary John Hamre to postpone a final decision on the transfer
until a Pentagon agency studies the issue.
</P>
<P>
   But the agency, the Defense Depot Management Council, approved
an Air Force request to transfer the workload to Utah during a Jan.
14 Pentagon meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Rodriguez said ``there's some degree of hope'' the work
would remain in Texas.

   WISCONSIN -- PETRI. Rep. Thomas Petri pushed education funding
when other Republicans shunned it and is singularly responsible for
Wisconsin nearly losing its donor status with highway funding. But
state Republicans say that he's invisible to the state Republican
Party and that he spends much of his time in Washington, D.C.

   NEW YORK _ As darkness falls, a burly man lugging a boom box
heads into Inwood Hill Park followed by a group of others. Your
heart could sink at the prospect of Manhattan's last stand of real
forest, tucked away in the northwestern corner of the borough,
being desecrated by loud music. But hold on. The fellow in front is
Michael Feller, the Parks Department's senior naturalist. He is
leading a nocturnal tour of the 190-acre park. What happens next
is, to say the least, not typical of Manhattan night life.
</P>
<P>
   Feller's group hikes into the narrow valley called the Clove. It
is dominated by tulip trees soaring to 100 feet, their high canopy
shattering the starlight. This kind of verticality could be
confused with a redwood grove of the Northwest. Feller flicks on
the boom box. It's now 9:20 p.m. Out of the tape drive comes a
high, arching whinny, pure and sweet. If a mare could sing Puccini,
this would be its voice. Feller turns off the boom box. The group
waits and listens.
</P>
<P>
   At first, there is only the layered, sotto voce drumming of
crickets and cicadas. Then, from the high ground to the west, comes
what at first sounds like a distant echo. He replays the tape
several times. The answering whinny comes closer. Suddenly, a pair
of ash-gray wings swoops low over the group, swift and silent. It's
a screech owl, ready to challenge the electronic trespasser on its
hunting territory.
</P>
<P>
   Another screech owl makes a sortie so low over Feller that he
instinctively rubs the back of his neck. ``He's ticked off at us,''
he says. Moments later, a third owl appears on the branch of an
oak. Its eyes, caught in the beam of Feller's head-mounted
flashlight, are golden yellow and hard as marbles.
</P>
<P>
   No other Manhattan park is known to play host to a family of
screech owls. Neither is any other park in the borough quite like
Inwood Hill. The others are distinctly urban places. Their beauty,
even when they are verdant, may have been enabled or enhanced by
artifice and engineering.
</P>
<P>
   At Bethesda Fountain in Central Park, or on the overlooks of
Fort Tryon Park, you always know you're in the city. Trekking over
the slopes of Inwood Hill Park, though, you are simply in the
woods.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could define this as Manhattan's wilderness,'' Parks
Commissioner Henry Stern said one morning, sitting on a bench under
a sweet gum tree at the Isham Street entrance to the park. ``It's
also the park that nobody knows.''
</P>
<P>
   Stern grew up a few blocks away in the Inwood section, on Post
Avenue. His father, a Boy Scout enthusiast, owned a tent store in
the neighborhood on Nagle Avenue. Stern said one of his earliest
memories was of playing at the Beak Street entrance to the park,
while his mother sat with other mothers and chatted. Running just
300 feet from Seaman Avenue before dead-ending in the park, Beak
Street is the borough's shortest mapped street above Canal Street.
Aficionados of intact Art Deco apartment houses will love Beak
Street, along with dozens of others in Inwood.
</P>
<P>
   In his most feeling tribute to his boyhood days spent in Inwood
Park, Stern said gratefully: ``I never got beat up here. This was
not a fighting park. Neither the Jets nor the Sharks would have
been comfortable in Inwood Park.''
</P>
<P>
   There is nothing scrubby about Inwood Hill's forest, which makes
it easy to mistake it for virgin growth. But most of the timber
there was cut down during the Revolutionary War by British troops
and Hessian mercenaries who used it for firewood and fortification.
They had driven Colonial forces from this strategic spot, as well
as from Fort Tryon to the south, on Nov. 16, 1776. They did not
leave until 1783.
</P>
<P>
   After the Civil War, several great estates were built on Inwood
Hill, including an Italian-style villa belonging to Isidore Straus,
the retail tycoon who went down on the Titanic. The Refuge of
Mercy, an Episcopal home for unwed mothers, was also built on the
crest of the hill, overlooking the Hudson River. It was,
presumably, suitably removed from the rest of the city to give the
young women privacy. Ornamental trees planted then still flourish.
</P>
<P>
   Park designer Frederick Law Olmsted, recognizing the value of
this terrain, recommended that development be restrained.
Public-spirited landowners, notably the Dyckman, Isham and Payson
families, deeded large tracts to the city. In 1916, Inwood Hill
became a public park.
</P>
<P>
   The most dramatic approach to the park is from the north, along
218th Street, a five-minute walk from the 215th Street subway
station on the IRT's Broadway local. You will come upon a complex
vista unlike any other in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   To the north, on your right, is the Harlem River on its final
leg before joining the Hudson in the swirl of Spuyten Duyvil. The
sheer cliff on the far side, threaded at its base by Metro North
tracks, defines Marble Hill, its heights studded with ungainly
apartment buildings. Straight ahead is a tidal lagoon. Bordered by
swamp grasses, it is the only accessible salt marsh in Manhattan
and a magnet for water birds. Off to the left are low rolling
athletic fields where soccer is the favored sport.
</P>
<P>
   Straight ahead, Inwood Hill itself juts into Spuyten Duyvil,
which is spanned by the Henry Hudson Bridge, its steel gridwork
painted bright red. Beyond that is the low-slung Amtrak bridge,
part of the shoreline route to Albany. The final piece of this
complex tableau is the noble New Jersey Palisades, looming up a
mile away across the Hudson.
</P>
<P>
   Before heading into the forest, stop first at the park's ecology
center (open 11 a.m. to 4 p.m. on weekdays, 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. on
weekends), on the lagoon. You can pick up a map as well as a
schedule of tours led by urban park rangers in all seasons. Even
canoe expeditions are offered. The center's displays are modest but
informative and very child friendly. There are also clean
restrooms, rare as screech owls in city parks.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone knows that, back in 1626, Peter Minuit bought Manhattan
from the Indians for $24 worth of trinkets. But few know where the
deal was struck. Right here, according to a tablet on a large
stone, Tablet Rock, also known as Shorakapkock Rock, near the 218th
Street entrance to Inwood Park. An ancient tulip tree grew at this
spot, said to be the oldest living thing in Manhattan. Indians held
powwows, with dances and chanting, under this tree every September
right up until it was finally cut down in 1938. They also held
canoe races in the river. An Indian named Princess Naomi, always
dressed in Indian clothing, once kept a trinket shop beside this
spot.
</P>
<P>
   Within a few steps of entering the park, you are in the Clove.
Almost magically, any and all signs of the city are shut off. A
steep, rockbound hillside rises to the right. Its rock ledges and
overhangs are known as the Indian Caves. Many artifacts of the
Shorakapkock Indians of the Delaware tribe have been found here.
This year's mild winter invited an early arrival of
Dutchman's-breeches and other spring ephemerals, which precede the
leafing of the trees. The Clove's season of copious dogwood also
came early. May brought on ferns, jack-in-the-pulpits and Solomon's
seal with its dangly little flowers. Last to appear are the highest
blossoms, the pale white ones of the tulip trees. As summer
deepens, blackberries and wineberries ripen along the path. They
are delectable.
</P>
<P>
   ``In geology, form and species, what you have here is close to a
Southern Appalachian bowl forest,'' explains Adrian Benape, the
Parks Department's Manhattan chief. What's extraordinary about that
comparison? Only that Benape is standing a few blocks from two
subway lines and less than a mile from the infamous drug-dealing
zone of Washington Heights.
</P>
<P>
   The path upward through the Clove is blocked here and there by
fallen trees and narrowed by bushes, including poison ivy.
Old-fashioned street lamps, installed in the 1960s, are all broken,
as they are throughout the park. And they will stay that way.
</P>
<P>
   ``They can't be defended against vandals,'' Stern explained.
``And without them, the park is more rustic.''
</P>
<P>
   As for those fallen trees, the idea is to let them become havens
for small creatures. The single biggest boon to Inwood Hill Park in
recent years was the blocking of its narrow, paved paths. They were
just wide enough for car thieves to drive into the wilderness,
where they could strip the cars in peace. Stanchions now prevent
their entry.
</P>
<P>
   Walking higher, you will leave behind the tulip trees, which
prefer the fertile soil of the valley floor. Oaks, maples and black
locusts now predominate. You will also see a pair of the largest
copper beeches in the city, their smooth-skinned, bulbous trunks
more than 14 feet in diameter. They flank what may also be the
city's most ancient ginkgo. Benape estimates its age at 150 years.
There are few evergreens in Inwood Hill forest.
</P>
<P>

   Inwood, a neighborhood tucked away in the northwestern corner of
Manhattan, is easily reached by the IRT No. 1 train, stopping at
215th Street, or the A train, terminating at 207th Street. The
Urban Park Rangers maintain a year-round schedule of free walking
tours of Inwood Hill Park. All begin at the Urban Ecology Center,
inside the park at West 218th Street and Indian Road. Information:

 &HT;    GOP HOUSE MEMBERS BID TO VETO CLINTON BAN ON CERTAIN ABORTIONS
 &HT;    By MARK SHERMAN
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Using words like ``execution'' and ``infanticide,''
Republicans led the House of Representatives in a bid to override
President Clinton's veto of a ban on certain late-term abortions
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The timing of the vote eight months after Clinton's veto and
less than four months before congressional elections drew cries of
protest from the mainly Democratic opposition.
</P>
<P>
   Seventy-seven Democrats joined 219 Republicans to provide more
than the two-thirds vote needed to overcome a presidential veto.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of the procedure known as partial-birth abortions
supplied graphic descriptions and florid language to drive home
their point. ``We're talking about killing, killing healthy
babies,'' said Rep. Sue Myrick, R-N.C. ``It's closer to infanticide
than to abortion.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Chris Smith, R-N.J., a leader of anti-abortion forces in
the House, likened the procedure to an ``execution.''
</P>
<P>
   The bill Clinton vetoed in October would bar doctors from using
a procedure in which a fetus is partially delivered vaginally, feet
first, and then an incision is made in a barely visible skull and
its contents drained. It would allow exceptions only when the
mother's life is in jeopardy .
</P>
<P>
   The anti-climactic vote in the House _ which already had
provided veto-proof support of the abortion ban _ sets the stage
for the Senate's consideration of Clinton's veto, probably sometime
in September.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate voted 64-36 last year to ban partial-birth abortions,
three votes shy of a two-thirds majority.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's clear that we face an uphill battle in the Senate,'' said
Rep. Charles Canady, R-Fla., chief sponsor of the ban.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's allies in the House said the ban is unconstitutional
and chided GOP leaders for trying to make it an election-year
issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a political issue for the 1998 election,'' said Rep.
Diana DeGette, D-Colo.
</P>
<P>
   Speaker Newt Gingrich and other members of Congress gathered
with Christian and Jewish clergy just before the vote to prod the
Senate to act.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think what's happening now is an answer to prayer,'' said
Rabbi Joseph Ehrenkranz of Fairfield, Conn., one of three rabbis to
appear with Gingrich.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who has twice vetoed bills to outlaw the abortion
procedure, has said he would sign a partial-birth ban into law if
it provided ``a limited exception for the small number of
compelling health cases where use of this procedure is necessary to
avoid serious health consequences.''
</P>
<P>
   But Canady said Clinton has demonstrated his unwillingness to
sign a bill with meaningful ``restrictions on partial-birth
abortions.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans already this year have held a number of votes
intended to please their conservative base and Thursday's appeared
to be no different. Officials of the Christian Coalition also
attended the Gingrich news conference.
</P>
<P>
   The House also recently passed a bill to prohibit people from
taking minors across state lines to evade some states' parental
notification laws on abortions. That legislation, however, did not
pass with a large enough majority to overcome a veto.

 By PETER MARKS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Remember how smitten you were, how bowled over and
enchanted, by your first foreign film? The experience was in every
sense an eye-opener: the exotic words from the lips of heavy-lidded
actors, the voluptuous camera work, the smoky, seemingly
unrestrained carnality.
</P>
<P>
   Well, sitting through ``F(AT)ust, Version 3.0,'' the live,
multi-media piece by the Spanish theater company La Fura dels Baus,
is the opposite of that. A compression of the epic verse play that
took Goethe a lifetime to compose, ``F(AT)ust, Version 3.0'' is a
disenchantment that manages to close the mind in an economical 100
minutes. It's as muddled and gratuitously profane as a particularly
juvenile effort by a group of first-year film students.
</P>
<P>
   The production at the New York State Theater, part of Lincoln
Center Festival `98, will no doubt have its partisans, although the
performance I saw seemed to leave the audience sort of woozy and
baffled.
</P>
<P>
   La Fura, a troupe founded in Barcelona in 1979, specializes in
visual spectacle, and if it's music-video style razmatazz you're
after, you may find what you're looking for here. The company sets
off fireworks with the precision of the Gruccis.
</P>
<P>
   The vast State Theater stage looks as if it has been redecorated
by Mummenschanz going through a heavy-metal phase. Two towering
steel sculptures _ one of whirling cylinders, the other, a giant
fan blowing through billowing tubes _ stand guard at stage right
and left. (At one point in the show, the fan is turned on, a la one
of those curtain songs in old Broadway musicals, apparently to
distract the audience from some onstage personnel-shifting.)
Modular screens fold and unfold, actors dangle upside down from
rotating platforms, a video of a raging inferno metamorphoses into
the real thing.
</P>
<P>
   What does any of this have to do with Goethe? Good question. La
Fura seems to be trying to translate the nearly two-century-old
German work into some universal language of the late 1990s, cobbled
together from television and video-game images and computerese.
</P>
<P>
   But all the troupe really accomplishes is transforming a
masterpiece into techno-gibberish. Consider La Fura's own
justification, contained in its press materials:
</P>
<P>
   ``The saturation of information in the computer web, often read
from an optimism which is heir to the optimism of progress, does
not improve, nor transform the human condition, created without
purpose by evolution's laws of chance: tied to the imperious
demands of primary instincts against which the retaining walls of
social rules are erected.''
</P>
<P>
   You want me to run that by you again? It often appears to be the
case in the theater these days that the more a company has to
explain, however ineptly, what it is trying to do, the less
successful it is in actually doing it.
</P>
<P>
   (According to the handout, even those whirling cylinders and
billowing tubes have hidden meaning, as symbols intended to
correspond to themes in the music. Uh huh.)
</P>
<P>
   ``F(AT)ust, Version 3.0'' _ the title, of course, is a software
term _ transports the legend of Faust to the World Wide Web. In
this adaptation, performed in Spanish with a mediocre simultaneous
English translation, Faust (Santi Pons) is fed up with the
knowledge he has gained through computers and, with some nifty
horror-movie special effects, hangs himself from a sparking
electrical cord.
</P>
<P>
   Talk about your existential crises: after he's dead, Faust meets
Mephistopheles, played with authority by Miquel Gelabert as a kind
of thuggish, supernatural Goodfella, who in their famous pact
whisks Faust away from the world of knowledge with an offer to
expose him to the pleasures of the flesh.
</P>
<P>
   The dialogue is filled with pseudo-intellectual aphorisms (like,
``Art is long; your life is short'') that put you in mind of a
half-baked extension-school philosophy course _ ``Existence: Good
or Bad?'' And the humor is of the lamest sort: late in the
proceedings a game-show parody, of all tired things, is staged.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, much of ``F(AT)ust, Version 3.0'' is neither
computer-driven nor pensive in that cerebral way we think of as
``European.'' It's just kind of smutty.
</P>
<P>
   The obscene acts _ a drag queen masturbating as Faust watches, a
man anally raping his sister _ are presented for their shock value.
There's a sense of adolescent rebellion about these moments, as in,
``How much can we get away with?''
</P>
<P>
   The members of the troupe have been quoted as saying that
``F(AT)ust, Version 3.0'' is their first production with a written
text. It shows. As with so much of what is presented in the
contemporary theater, this ``Faust'' is a vanquishing of the script
by the blueprint. ``Razzle-dazzle 'em, and they'll make you a
star,'' goes the line in ``Chicago.'' Well, not always. &QL;

spirit-crushing summer extravaganza includes not a single heartfelt
moment, unless you count its sequence set in a strip club. Imminent
doom (courtesy of an approaching asteroid) becomes the excuse for
rampant flag-waving, gung-ho patriotism and a notion of heroism
that has nothing whatever to do with real courage. Willis gets the
film's noblest lines for the same reason that he probably got the
set's biggest trailer. Affleck tries gamely to seem mad about Ms.
Tyler, who serves as window-dressing at NASA headquarters. Totally
predictable elements _ loud noises, frequent explosions and bright
computer-screen colors _ seem as inevitable and deadly as the
asteroid while they create the illusion of escapist fun (Janet
Maslin).

   `CITY OF ANGELS,' starring Nicolas Cage and Meg Ryan. Directed
by Brad Silberling (PG-13, 112 minutes). An empty Hollywood remake
of ``Wings of Desire,'' Wim Wenders' poetic 1987 cult favorite,
``City of Angels'' wants to be a blockbuster sob fest in the
supernatural romantic tradition of ``Heaven Can Wait,'' ``Ghost''
and ``Titanic.'' But the ingredients don't gel. Cage is the droopy
sad-sack angel who falls in love with Ms. Ryan's perky, bike-riding
Los Angeles cardiologist and tumbles out of heaven just to be with
her. Unfortunately, Cage looks more like a serial killer (or a
sinister cult leader) than an angel, and he and Ms. Ryan lack
romantic chemistry. The screenplay's watered-down New Age cliches
are illustrated by cinematography that lends the California
settings the shallow gloss of a shampoo commercial (Stephen
Holden).
</P>
<P>
   `DR. DOLITTLE,' starring Eddie Murphy. Directed by Betty Thomas
(PG-13, 85 minutes). When this Dr. Dolittle talks to the animals,
they pile on the back talk, thanks to the stellar cast of vocal
talent (Ellen DeGeneres, Garry Shandling, Paul Reubens, John
Leguizamo) that keeps the wisecracks flying. And Murphy plays
straight man with hilarious aplomb. This good-humored family film
is formulaic but steadily funny (and a lot less corrosive than
``The Nutty Professor''), thanks not only to Murphy's understated
timing, but also to expertly computer-enhanced performances from
the animal cast (Maslin).

   `EVEREST,' directed by David Brashears with Greg MacGillivray
(not rated; 45 minutes). If life in New York City doesn't provide
enough in the way of thrills, those in search of a vicarious
near-death experience can make their way to the Sony Imax Theater
at Lincoln Square (1998 Broadway, at 68th Street) for a go at
``Everest.'' There, images of the world's highest mountain _ 29,028
feet _ find a frame worthy of the peak's spectacular, lethal
beauty: the eight-story high, 100-foot wide screen. This account
focuses mainly on the efforts of three people to scale the peak in
1996 despite yawning chasms of ever-shifting ice, thundering
avalanches, the perils of air so thin that it addles the brain, and
sudden, blinding storms. While this expedition was on the mountain,
as many articles and books were later to relate, other teams made
their way into the so-called Death Zone, at 25,000 feet, where a
violent storm overtook them. Eight people perished in the worst
single disaster on the mountain. ``Everest'' makes it possible for
armchair adventurers to share the risks and glory of their climb
toward heaven (Lawrence Van Gelder).
</P>
<P>
   `GONE WITH THE WIND,' starring Vivien Leigh, Clark Gable, Olivia
de Havilland, Leslie Howard and Hattie McDaniel. Directed by Victor
Fleming (G, 220 minutes). There's still a lot of robust life left
in this 1939 David O. Selznick adaptation of Margaret Mitchell's
romantic novel of the Old South (possibly as it never existed) just
before, during and after the Civil War. Not a great film but a
satisfying one. The performances by Leigh, Gable and McDaniel are
ravishing, and there's grandeur in the meticulous physical
production. The movie shows its age most unfortunately in the
uneven quality of the Technicolor prints, which, though new, go
sort of pinkish more often than they should (Vincent Canby).
</P>
<P>
   `HENRY FOOL,' starring Thomas Jay Ryan, James Urbaniak and
Parker Posey. Directed by Hal Hartley (R, 138 minutes). The
affectless precision of this filmmaker's previous work is
absolutely no preparation for the brilliance and deep resonance of
this contemporary parable. Without forsaking the clean, spare look
and hyperreal clarity that are his trademarks, Hartley moves into a
much larger realm with a meditation on, among other things, art,
trust, loyalty, politics and popular culture. When Henry Fool
(Ryan) bursts mysteriously into the thankless life of Simon Grim
(Urbaniak) and urges this silent garbage man to start writing, the
results are strange and sublime. Ms. Posey plays Simon's slatternly
sister with nonchalant wit in one of her best roles. A few
glaringly scatological touches don't detract from the film's
elegance of vision (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `HIGH ART,' starring Ally Sheedy and Radha Mitchell. Directed by
Lisa Cholodenko (R, 96 minutes). Ms. Sheedy gives a fierce, tricky
performance in the role of a once-celebrated photographer, spooked
by fame, who long ago retreated from the art world to live a
reclusive, druggy life among lesbian friends. This steamily intense
story follows her spider-fly relationship with Ms. Mitchell's
bright-eyed, ambitious ingenue, who works for a desperately stylish
photography magazine. Ms. Cholodenko's seductive, powerfully
atmospheric first feature explores their relationship with
intelligence and avidity. But it sacrifices any hope of raw edges
and real emotion to its own chic sensibility, which proves so
studiously alluring that it overwhelms the story. Patricia Clarkson
does a scene-stealing turn as Ms. Sheedy's lover, a glamorously
decadent German actress who never got past the Fassbinder years
(Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `THE LAST DAYS OF DISCO,' starring Kate Beckinsale and Chloe
Sevigny. Directed by Whit Stillman (R, 112 minutes). Stillman's
smart, fretful, patrician characters turn up midway between
``Metropolitan'' and ``Barcelona'' in a film that charmingly mixes
post-college career worries with improbable discomania. A
delightful cast engages in nonstop flirtation and hair-splitting
debate, rendered with Stillman's usual acuity and humor. Ms.
Beckinsale, an English actress with a flawless American accent here
and diffidence that's just as perfect, holds court beguilingly at
the center of a bright and amusing crowd. The ideal film for anyone
willing to entertain the notion that the spread of environmentalism
was sparked by the revival of ``Bambi'' during the disco
generation's formative years (Maslin).
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   `LETHAL WEAPON 4,' starring Mel Gibson, Danny Glover and Rene
Russo. Directed by Richard Donner (R, 125 minutes). In the full
perspective-warping heat of the summer movie season, this turns out
to be one of the nicer blow-'em-ups around. The characters are
funny and likable, and they all live on Earth. The formula still
has some zip. The stars, with the welcome new addition of Chris
Rock as a young detective who has literally married into the
``Lethal Weapon'' family, play their roles with breezy finesse. And
the story, aboutslave smuggling and Chinese gangsters, is a
flamboyant, fight-filled adventure fueled by kidding camaraderie
and constant forward motion. Bear in mind that this is still a film
whose idea of high drama is watching a car get pushed in front of
an oncoming train (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `THE MASK OF ZORRO,' starring Antonio Banderas, Anthony Hopkins
and Catherine Zeta-Jones. Directed by Martin Campbell (PG-13, 130
minutes). Travel back to the days when swashbuckling was serious
business, when boyish adventure films still had their innocence,
and when the bravado of thrilling stunt work was all a movie needed
in the way of special effects. Hopkins is marvelously game as the
film's dashing senior Zorro. Banderas was born to play the aging
hero's jokey, hot-blooded protege. And he meets his match in the
story's heroine, whose beauty is inevitably described as ``beyond
compare.'' This robust old-fashioned adventure should appeal to
older children, but beware of a few needlessly grisly touches
(Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `MULAN,' with the voices of Ming-Na Wen, Eddie Murphy and B.D.
Wong. Directed by Barry Cook and Tony Bancroft (G, 86 minutes).
Disney takes a sledgehammer to the subject of gender stereotyping
in this film, which not only breaks the cross-dressing barrier but
also ratchets up the violence level for children's animation. This
is the most inert and formulaic of recent Disney animated films,
right down to the clowning sidekicks, would-be ``Under the Sea''
production number and Destiny ballad from the intrepid heroine
(``When will my reflection show who I am inside?''). Murphy's very
funny wisecracks make the character of a little dragon
entertaining, but this black-sounding character is also treated as
a servile clown. The animation mimics live-action crowd scenes more
often than it takes audiences to the realm of the imagination
(Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `NIGHTS OF CABIRIA,' starring Giulietta Masina. Directed by
Federico Fellini (not rated; 117 minutes). Anyone dismayed by the
hyperkinetic emptiness of summertime film spectacles will find the
antidote in this 1957 Fellini masterpiece. It has been refurbished
and revived by the same team that brought back ``Contempt'' last
year, and they display the same acumen in reissuing a film of
special prescience; though it was shot in black and white amid the
poverty of postwar Italy, neither the style nor the searching of
``Cabiria' has grown dated at all. In a prize-winning and
heartbreaking performance, the star plays a scrappy Roman
streetwalker who drifts almost magically among the film's
astonishingly varied realms. There is more grace and courage in the
famous image of Masina smiling through her tears than in all the
fire-breathing blockbusters Hollywood has to offer (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `THE OPPOSITE OF SEX,' starring Christina Ricci, Martin Donovan,
Lisa Kudrow and Lyle Lovett. Directed by Don Roos (R, 100 minutes).
Wicked, foulmouthed and very funny, this gleefully acerbic comedy
finds that Ms. Ricci has morphed enchantingly from nasty little
Wednesday of ``The Addams Family'' into Lolita's evil twin.
Voluptuous and scheming, her poisonous Dedee narrates this film and
announces immediately that she won't be developing a heart of gold.
Which is, of course, mostly a lie. The film brutally skewers
preconceptions about gay and straight life, then lets its
characters intermingle in sweetly unexpected ways. Donovan and Ms.
Kudrow, as unlikely comrades brought together by Dedee's treachery,
deliver the zingers from Roos' screenplay with deadpan panache
(Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `OUT OF SIGHT,' starring George Clooney and Jennifer Lopez.
Directed by Steven Soderbergh (R, 120 minutes). As directed with
terrific panache by Soderbergh in his most frankly commercial
effort, Clooney and Ms. Lopez take an intricate Elmore Leonard
crime tale and give it steam heat. Like ``Get Shorty,'' this story
has been adapted from a Leonard novel by Scott Frank, who knows
exactly how to capture the writer's shrewd, hard-boiled style on
screen. An outstanding supporting cast _ including Don Cheadle,
Dennis Farina and Albert Brooks _ provides the movie with a vivid
rogues' gallery and remains good fun even when the story is
occasionally confusing. To fill in the blanks, go back to Leonard's
version; there are certainly worse ways to spend a summer afternoon
(Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `A PERFECT MURDER,' starring Michael Douglas, Gwyneth Paltrow
and Viggo Mortensen. Directed by Andrew Davis (R, 107 minutes). The
characters may be cardboard-thin in this film, a skillfully plotted
update of Frederick Knott's play (and Alfred Hitchcock's film)
``Dial M for Murder,' but the nasty cat-and-mouse games they play
are icily amusing. Douglas, looking more than ever like a wattled,
riled-up rooster, is Steven Taylor, a shady Wall Street bond trader
in deep financial trouble who hires his rich wife's handsome lover
(Mortensen), a con man posing as a painter, to murder her. It's not
as easy as he hopes. Ms. Paltrow, looking chic, is the wife, Emily,
a translator at the United Nations, who has her own agenda. The
story takes enough surprising twists to keep you engrossed, and the
high-style ambiance (especially the Taylors' Fifth Avenue
apartment) is mouthwatering (Holden).
</P>
<P>
   `SIX DAYS, SEVEN NIGHTS,' starring Anne Heche and Harrison Ford.
Directed by Ivan Reitman (PG-13, 146 minutes). This escapist
romance for the Treadmill Generation is a workout in its own right,
putting its stars through the wringer (and into a ``From Here to
Eternity' surf clinch complete with hiking boots). The leads are
attractive and funny, and the screenplay strives for a
Tracy-Hepburn dynamic, but this truly strenuous love story is as
long on tropical scenery as it is short on new ideas. Once the
stars are marooned in splendid isolation, the film has to cook up
pirates and a snake in Ms. Heche's shorts just to keep afloat. In
supporting roles, David Schwimmer makes a drippy beau for Ms.
Heche; Temuera Morrison deserves his own pirate picture, and the
ex-grocery clerk Jacqueline Obrados torches up the film as if Salma
Hayek were in town (Maslin).

<P>

</P>
<P>
   `SMALL SOLDIERS,' starring Gregory Smith, Kirsten Dunst, Dennis
Leary and Phil Hartman. Directed by Joe Dante (PG-13, 105 minutes).
This ably animated film about action-figure toys who virtually come
to life should have been a sure thing. There are innocent echoes of
``Toy Story'' and darker ones of the director's own ``Gremlins''
pictures, which had the witty balance of mischief and horror that
``Small Soldiers'' strangely lacks. The voice talent here is
extraordinary, with the casts of ``The Dirty Dozen'' and ``This Is
Spinal Tap'' playing rival toy factions, and Tommy Lee Jones and
Frank Langella as their respective commanders. But the story
remains unfocused and grows too wan for horror, too creepy for
lighthearted fun. Another reason not to laugh is Hartman's
performance in the fatuous role that was his last (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `THE SPANISH PRISONER,' starring Campbell Scott, Rebecca
Pidgeon, Ben Gazzara and Steve Martin. Written and directed by
David Mamet (PG, 112 minutes). The most engaging of Mamet's
cinematic puzzles begins with an X-ray at an airport security
check. And the audience will wish it had a similar device for
reading the characters' sneaky minds. No such luck: the mystery
here, in a handsome and Hitchcockian film named for an elaborate
con game, stays tricky to the very end. Scott plays the inventor of
a lucrative, stealable scientific process, with Gazzara as the boss
who's in no hurry to compensate him for it. In an ensemble cast
working entirely on the calculating Mamet wavelength, Martin plays
a rich, debonair mystery man who tells the inventor all about his
pretty young sister. In her performance as a pert, unaccountably
off-kilter secretary, Ms. Pidgeon perfectly embodies the film's
sleight of hand (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT MARY,' starring Cameron Diaz, Ben
Stiller and Matt Dillon. Directed by Peter and Bobby Farrelly (R,
119 minutes). Sometimes Western civilization declines in
deliriously funny style. Hence this proudly obnoxious comedy is a
hoot in every sense, deserving a smidgen of disapproval and a whole
lot of helpless laughter. Set in motion by a prom, a crush and a
cruel, cruel zipper, this paean to low humor works ridiculously
well because it never stoops to being mean-spirited or (despite all
appearances) authentically inane. The principal cast is bright and
appealing, with Ms. Diaz at her most beautiful and blithe. Do note
that this film strives hard for something to offend everyone, and
that tolerance for the Farrellys' zit jokes is unfortunately
required (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `TITANIC,' starring Leonardo DiCaprio, Kate Winslet and Gloria
Stuart. Directed by James Cameron (PG-13, 197 minutes). For once, a
much-touted event movie is exactly that: a glorious throwback to
the days when epic storytelling really filled the screen. Despite
the astonishing technological advances behind Cameron's great
visual spectacle, gimmicks are never allowed to intrude on the
film's central illusion, that the audience is drawn back into the
Gilded Age and intimately involved in the fateful voyage. For all
its painstaking historical detail, this ``Titanic'' proves anything
but quaint, thanks to the phenomenal immediacy of its sights and
the pure Hollywood hokum of its story. As two young lovers whose
romance is skillfully interwoven with historical detail, Ms.
Winslet and DiCaprio are a duo with serious chemistry. With his
``Gone With the Wind''-caliber ambitions, Cameron dared to dream of
the impossible and came up with the movie of the year (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `THE TRUMAN SHOW,' starring Jim Carrey, Laura Linney and Ed
Harris. Directed by Peter Weir and written by Andrew Niccol (PG,
104 minutes). The ultimate in high-concept ingenuity. Hosannas and
cartwheels for this ingenious media-age fantasy are over the top,
but by comparison with Hollywood's usual notion of summer movie
fare, it's definitely a dazzler. Carrey, refreshingly free of
shtick, gives an instantly iconic performance as a guinea pig for
an entertainment-happy nation, a man whose whole life is a fraud
contrived by Harris' so-called ``televisionary.'' Carrey's innate
edge of volatility gives the material, from a screenplay of
transfixing sci-fi intensity, its trace of danger. Ms. Linney, as
the actress playing a wife whose bluff could be called at any
moment, is the story's spookiest character as well as its perkiest.
Weir unifies the story's many nuances with great finesse (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `THE X-FILES,' starring David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson.
Directed by Rob Bowman (PG-13, 115 minutes). Conspiracy theorists,
consider this: What if the hush-hush atmosphere and Internet mania
surrounding the first ``X-Files' feature film were part of a giant
scheme to hide the uneventfulness of a summertime sci-fi fizzle?
It's as possible as much of what this spinoff film has to offer. If
devotees of the television series approach the film with enough
baggage for a six-week safari, maybe they can deepen the experience
of watching a middling action-adventure with brand-name appeal. But
this film will strike true X-fanatics as watered down and remains
fairly bewildering to the uninitiated. And no, Scully and Mulder
don't quite take their working relationship to a higher plane
(Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   Film Series
</P>
<P>
   `A SPIELBERG SUMMER.' As the American Museum of the Moving Image
aptly recognizes in titling its current series, this is ``A
Spielberg Summer.'' Steven Spielberg, the filmmaker responsible for
nine of the top 25 domestic box-office hits of all time, is
represented this summer by four new films, including ``Saving
Private Ryan,' which he directed, and ``Deep Impact,'' ``The Mask
of Zorro'' and ``Small Soldiers.'' So the time seems right for a
lengthy retrospective. Saturday, the attractions are ``Who Framed
Roger Rabbit''(1988) at 2 and 7 p.m. and ``Indiana Jones and the
Temple of Doom'' (1984) at 4:30 p.m. On Sunday, the features are
``Jaws'' (1975) at 2 p.m. and ``Close Encounters of the Third
Kind'' (1977) at 4:30 p.m. Incorporating films of which Spielberg
was director or executive producer, the series will devote
subsequent weekends to such films as ``The Color Purple'' and
``Schindler's List.'' Admission to the series, continuing through
Sept. 6 at the museum (35th Avenue at 36th Street in Astoria,
Queens) is $8.50 for adults, $5.50 for people over 65 and students
with ID, $4.50 for children 5 to 18 and free to children under 4.

&HT;        SENATE TAKES ON PHONE CRAMMING
</HEADLINE>
 &HT;     By Megan Feldman  
 &HT;    c. 1998 States News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON, July 23-- A Maine resident recently found a
mysterious $10.25 charge on his local telephone bill for a credit
card he does not have.
</P>
<P>
   An Indiana woman was charged on her phone bill for a psychic
club membership she never agreed to. And a New Yorker was charged
for a personal 800 number that he tried in vane to stop the phone
company from charging him for.
</P>
<P>
   These mystery charges are small in nature, but they have
appeared on phone bills across the country. Known as ``cramming,''
it is now considered the largest telemarketing scam in the nation
by consumer groups, with 300 written complaints sent to the Federal
Communications Commission (FCC) every month.
</P>
<P>
   The surge in billing people for services they never ordered
sparked a Senate investigation and led the FCC to push local
telecommunication companies to devise guidelines to combat the
fraudulent practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should have zero tolerance of this kind of fraud, which
uses a vital utility like telephone service to rip off American
families,'' said Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, chairwoman of the
Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations (PSI), who led Thursday's
hearing on cramming.
</P>
<P>
   Under the current system, any business can enter into a contract
with a local telephone or billing company to charge consumers
through their phone bills. No questions asked by the phone company.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the culprits include singles lines, voice mail services
and Internet access companies that charge monthly fees to people
who may not even have a home computer.
</P>
<P>
   Under the new guidelines, which the FCC released Wednesday,
phone companies would screen products for which they are asked to
provide billing and immediately provide credit to customers who say
they've been ``crammed,'' said Lawrence Strickling, deputy chief of
the Common Carrier Bureau of the FCC.
</P>
<P>
   But Collins called the guidelines a ``good first step,''
doubting their effectiveness because local phone companies are not
bound to abide by them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have concerns about the voluntary nature of the
guidelines,'' she said, ``would this make for inconsistent
enforcement and protection?''
</P>
<P>
   But Roy Neel, president of the United States Telephone
Association, was confident that the newly composed list will curb
cramming and protect consumers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Consumer protection is good business, and I'd like to see the
competition between companies to protect consumers run its course
before imposing any new federal laws,'' said Neel, who represents
local phone companies' interests in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Trade Commission apprehended Online Consulting
Group, Inc., which made $5 million in one year by advertising
``free-matching'' services with local singles. Once the single
called, for free, someone from the company immediately returned the
call -- and charged the person $4 per minute.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Richard Durbin, D-Ill, agreed with Collins that enforceable
regulations were needed to protect consumers. ``People shouldn't
need a microscope or a bloodhound to check their phone bills, he
said.''

MODERN LIBRARY OPENS A NEW CHAPTER IN LITERARY LISTLESSNESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By EDVINS BEITIKS  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Making lists used to be a crazed and personal
thing.
</P>
<P>
   But now conglomerates have taken over, printing lists by
committee, and the best five isn't enough. It's 100 at a time _ the
fast-food mentality brought to history, art and literature.
</P>
<P>
   On the heels of the hundred most important people and the
hundred best American films comes the hundred best English-language
novels of the century, trumpeted by a panel of literates from
Modern Library. It's another sign of the sound-biting of the
American intellect, of cutting culture down to USA Today size,
making it manageable and easy-to-swallow.
</P>
<P>
   People will argue that anything that'll move the huddled masses
closer to books is a good thing, but marketing tools like the
Modern Library list are a demeaning way to do it, a kind of
time-clock, corporate look at writing.
</P>
<P>
   The Modern Library's top five are ``Ulysses,'' ``The Great
Gatsby,'' ``A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man,'' ``Lolita''
and ``Brave New World.'' There aren't many surprises after that,
unless you cough loudly at the first Hemingway novel appearing at
No. 45, J.D. Salinger's ``The Catcher in the Rye'' coming in at 64,
or the pronounced absence of comic novels.
</P>
<P>
   The Modern Library panel, unlike the whoopee cushions that voted
for the 100 best films, has impeccable credentials. The 10-man
panel, which included authors Gore Vidal, Shelby Foote and William
Styron, offered a list of 100 books virtually impossible to argue
against.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike the American Film Institute, which did well with its
top five before going immediately into the toilet, the first five
on the Modern Library list are out of kilter. Even panel members
say so.
</P>
<P>
   With the wealth of English writing in this century, one author
should not appear twice in the top five, and James Joyce's ``A
Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man'' doesn't belong at No. 3.
Panelist Edmund Morris, a historian, said the book doesn't deserve
that high a slot, calling it ``a sketch for `Ulysses.''' He also
questioned the placement of ``Brave New World.'' It's not Aldous
Huxley's best, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Foote agreed, saying he had no problem with ``Ulysses'' and
``The Great Gatsby,'' but had ``trouble with the others,''
preferring D.H. Lawrence's ``The Rainbow'' and William Faulkner's
``As I Lay Dying'' in the top five.
</P>
<P>
   He's right. ``As I Lay Dying'' is a better book than ``The Sound
and the Fury,'' the perennial frosh-soph Faulkner read that came in
at No. 6. And Faulkner's ``Absalom, Absalom'' is a better book than
the panel's 54th choice, ``Light in August.''
</P>
<P>
   Just as ``Touch of Evil'' should get serious consideration as
one of the best American movies on the strength of its opening
time-bomb scene, ``Absalom, Absalom'' should get consideration
among the 100-best novels because it offers what some believe to be
the best opening chapter in the language.
</P>
<P>
   Faulkner has three books on the list. So does Henry James. So do
Joyce and D.H. Lawrence. Joseph Conrad, a true artist of the
language, led all authors with four books, topped by ``The Secret
Agent'' at No. 44.
</P>
<P>
   But ``Heart of Darkness'' is more compelling than ``The Secret
Agent,'' and the list wouldn't have suffered if Conrad's fourth
book, ``Lord Jim,'' had been left off. The same is true for Joyce's
``Finnegans Wake,'' an in-house pick of pompous English professors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Finnegans Wake'' has more fun with words than any 10 other
books, but c'mon. Even when it's fairly accessible, it's
pretentious as hell.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Wolfe didn't make the list, presumably because his style
has fallen out of favor. Wolfe can be tiresome, yes. But for
sustained pretension he has nothing on Joyce. ``Finnegans Wake,''
even at No. 77, doesn't belong.
</P>
<P>
   There are no other books that beg to be jettisoned, although
Styron making the list with ``Sophie's Choice'' is bound to raise
eyebrows.
</P>
<P>
   And there is a rhythm to the entries that is kind of odd, with
names bunching up together.
</P>
<P>
   Three times authors are listed back-to-back: James at 26 and 27,
Conrad at 46 and 47, Lawrence at 48 and 49, which does not speak to
much originality from the panel. And there are books that fairly
scream their absence. Harper Lee's ``To Kill a Mockingbird.''
Carson McCullers' ``A Member of the Wedding.'' James Agee's ``A
Death in the Family.'' Thomas Pynchon's ``Gravity's Rainbow.''
</P>
<P>
   The panel shied away from contemporary authors because it wanted
books that have had time to filter down to genius, which may be the
reason John Updike, Zora Neale Hurston and Ray Bradbury aren't
listed. But then why do Styron, William Kennedy and Salman Rushdie
make the cut?
</P>
<P>
   There is also a dearth of laughing novels. Where is anything by
Kingsley Amis or P.G. Wodehouse, by Brendan Behan or William
Saroyan? And how about mystery and intrigue? Eric Ambler has to be
on that list, with ``Judgment of Deltchev'' or ``The Schirmer
Inheritance.'' So does Raymond Chandler.
</P>
<P>
   Dashiell Hammett's ``The Maltese Falcon'' comes in at 56, but
there's no sign of ``The Big Sleep'' or ``The Long Goodbye,'' of
``Farewell, My Lovely'' or ``The Little Sister''? Phooey. And while
we're at it, where's Dorothy Sayers' ``Nine Tailors''?
</P>
<P>
   There aren't many war novels, either, for a century that's been
defined by war. ``Catch-22'' deserves its No. 7 ranking, but then
it's a greased slide to Norman Mailer's ``The Naked and the Dead''
at No. 51, another 11 spots to ``From Here to Eternity,'' 12 more
to ``A Farewell to Arms.'' And those aren't the best novels on this
century's wars.
</P>
<P>
   ``Naked and the Dead'' takes too many yawn-inspiring detours,
James Jones' ``A Thin Red Line'' is arguably better than ``From
Here to Eternity,'' and ``Farewell to Arms'' has fathered more bad
films than anyone thought possible.
</P>
<P>
   Because the Modern Library panel favors writers who sustained
their artistry over three, four or five books, the list overlooks
authors whose one-shot novels were pretty good. George Mandel's
``The Wax Boom,'' for instance. ``Paths of Glory'' by Humphrey
Cobb. Harry Brown's ``A Walk in the Sun.'' Frederic Wakeman's
``Shore Leave.''
</P>
<P>
   Even writers whose work turned mediocre can point to impressive
pieces _ James Gould Cozzens' ``Guard of Honor,'' Irwin Shaw's
``The Young Lions'' and David Ormsbee's ``The Sound of an
American.''
</P>
<P>
   The list lacks women, too. There are eight, with Virginia
Woolf's ``To the Lighthouse'' at No. 15 and McCullers' ``The Heart
Is a Lonely Hunter'' close behind. But there could be so many more
_ Sayers, Hurston, Doris Lessing, Mary McCarthy, Eudora Welty, Edna
Ferber, Daphne DuMaurier for ``Rebecca.''
</P>
<P>
   South African mystery writer James McClure deserves mention for
``The Artful Egg'' or ``The Gooseberry Fool.'' Herman Wouk's ``The
Caine Mutiny'' should be there. Maybe William Goldman's ``Soldier
in the Rain,'' and Charles Jackson's ``The Lost Weekend.''
</P>
<P>
   There are plenty of skewed things about the list, not the least
of which is the mind-set, the massive hubris that says it needs to
be done at all.

&HT;        SENATORS SEEK TO REFORM BOXING INDUSTRY
</HEADLINE>
 &HT;     By Mark D. Preston  
 &HT;    c. 1998 States News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON, July 23 -- The notorious power enjoyed by a few
promoters and managers in professional boxing is under attack by
members of the U.S. Senate who envision dramatic changes in the way
the sport is run.
</P>
<P>
   Legislation is pending in the Senate that would overhaul
professional boxing from the personal contracts boxers sign with
promoters to the rating system that ranks fighters.
</P>
<P>
   The bill -- named after boxing legend Muhammad Ali -- is
designed to put an end to anti-competitive and unethical business
practices rife in a sport that has no national oversight authority,
said the bill's two authors Sens. Richard Bryan, D-Nev., and John
McCain, R-Ariz.
</P>
<P>
   Bryan said a number of forces -- especially greed -- is ruining
professional boxing.
</P>
<P>
   ``A combination of problems has made boxing less attractive as a
sport,'' he said. ``And in some instances make it almost impossible
for the best fighters in the world... to fight against one
another.''
</P>
<P>
   Members of the professional boxing community visited the
nation's capital Thursday to testify before the Senate Commerce,
Science and Transportation Committee and endorse, at least in
theory, the bill's main thrust.
</P>
<P>
   However, two of the sport's biggest promoters were noticeably
absent. Bob Arum declined the Senate's invitation and Don King
failed to respond to it.
</P>
<P>
   Nevada and New Jersey boxing commissioners testified that there
is a need for federal laws to control the unscrupulous practices
they say are eating away at the popularity of professional boxing.
</P>
<P>
   To protect the boxer's rights, the bill would place a one year
limit on promotional rights that promoters could place on boxers to
participate in a particular match; prevents a boxer from being
forced to hire an associate or relative of the promoter; prohibits
a promoter from also managing a fighter's finances; and requires
both the promoter and sanctioning organization to disclose all
finances associated with the fight to the state boxing commission.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would also require sanctioning organizations staging
bouts in the U.S. to establish consistent criteria for rating
professional boxers.
</P>
<P>
   Eddie Futch, who trained 22 world champions including Joe
Frazier, Michael Spinks, and Riddick Bowe, told the committee an
overhaul of the rating system needs to take place to prevent
sanctioning organizations from manipulating the rankings for their
own financial gain.
</P>
<P>
   ``The quality of competition has gone down drastically, and I
want to see this repaired,'' Futch said. ``Unless we continue to do
something about it, it will continue to erode.''
</P>
<P>
   Walter Stone, counsel for the International Boxing Federation
(IBF), told the committee he was not opposed to the bill, but said
it did not address the increasing economic influence television and
pay per view has over the sport. Bryan said he is open to making
changes to the bill if the results are good for the sport.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Sulaiman, president of the World Boxing Council (WBC), said
he was interested in working to bring reform to the sport, but
resisted suggestions that the ratings system should be overhauled.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Tyson, a former client of King's, did not attend the
hearing but expressed support for the bill in a letter he sent to
the committee. Tyson said his financial career ``was placed in the
hands of a promoter and managers who were allowed to run amuck in
the ... unregulated world of boxing.''
</P>
<P>
   Tyson estimates he lost $65 million since 1995 and places part
of the blame on his ``promoter.'' Tyson never mentioned King by
name in the letter.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, said he expects a vote in the Senate this year, but with
only a handful of legislative work days left this year it is
unlikely the House will have a chance to review the bill. And
McCain predicts it will take a few years before the reforms become
law.

ART REVIEW: POETRY, SCIENCE AND HISTORY IN THE AGE OF GOETHE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JOHN RUSSELL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ There is at the Frick Collection a loan show of
drawings that is just the thing for high summer. Entitled ``Fuseli
to Menzel,'' it is small (80 items in all) and mostly downstairs.
Everything in it speaks for Germany in what is called ``the Age of
Goethe.'' The age in question can be elasticized, but basically it
spans the first half of the 19th century.
</P>
<P>
   The Age of Goethe was a memorable time for drawing in Germany. A
major participant in the show, Moritz von Schwind, was to say later
that ``it was to drawings, rather than to paintings, that we looked
for what was rich and important in the way of ideas.''
</P>
<P>
   This may sound like a putdown for painting. But what von Schwind
meant was that in the Age of Goethe, drawing and thinking had a lot
in common. Drawing had not been mere penciling. It was the partner
of poetry, and of the natural sciences, and of a sense of history.
Draftsmen in the Age of Goethe did a great deal more than draw.
</P>
<P>
   Like Caspar David Friedrich (the cream of the crop), many of the
draftsmen in the present show also excelled as easel painters.
Others were active as muralists, battle painters, stage designers,
professors of optics or doctors of philosophy. (Yet another, Carl
Gustav Carus, was both a pioneer biographer of Goethe and a
professor of obstetrics in Dresden.)
</P>
<P>
   Whole cities were to bear the mark of individual draftsmen as
architects, town planners, curators and collectors, leaders of
taste and teachers of history. They didn't have to be grizzled
veterans, either. The short-lived Friedrich Gilly (1772-1800) was
named chief inspector of buildings throughout Prussia when he was
only 25. The present show includes a recently rediscovered
watercolor by Gilly of the almost ruined castle church of
Marienburg, then in eastern Prussia, now in Poland. It was thanks
to him that the restoration of Marienburg was set in hand as a
national responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   The artists in the present show drew because _ either with
pencil and paper, or with brush and watercolor _ they could give a
lean and uncluttered account of what they saw. They could also, by
implication, find out what kind of people they themselves actually
were. What they produced were not ``exhibition drawings.'' They
were fragments of autobiography and, as such, haunting.
</P>
<P>
   Goethe himself produced many drawings of that sort. There is,
for instance, a raw urgency about the drawing in the Frick of some
blocks of weathered granite that he had first seen on a
mountainside in Upper Franconia in 1785. So vividly did he remember
them that he went back to see them 35 years later and made the
annotated drawing that is in the present show.
</P>
<P>
   It related to a long-running controversy about the creation of
the earth. Himself a lifelong student of geology, Goethe did not
believe that these stones had been tumbled this way and that by
ancient and colossal convulsions. On the contrary, he thought that
their evolution had been both calm and slow. His little drawing is
not, and was not meant to be, a ``thing of beauty.'' But there is
no mistaking the intensity of the conviction behind it.
</P>
<P>
   In the summer of 1810, Friedrich and his colleague Georg
Friedrich Kersting climbed up to around 4,000 feet in a mountainous
part of what is now the Czech Republic. They were looking for the
source of the Elbe river, which then as now was indispensable to
central and northern Europe.
</P>
<P>
   It was not yet a tourist attraction. The way led across a meadow
that looked like a gigantic eiderdown that had been left out in the
rain. But with time, Friedrich and his friend came upon a narrow
ditch that widened for just a yard or two. What looked like a
puddle on the move was the source of the Elbe.
</P>
<P>
   It was from this narrow slit in cheerless ground that Dresden
would draw power and strength, as would Prince Hamlet's Wittenberg,
and Martin Luther's Magdeburg, and the great Hanseatic city of
Hamburg. Friedrich's unemphatic image draws us back to that distant
but all-important puddle at 4,000 feet above sea level.
</P>
<P>
   The draftsman as historian is also uppermost at the Frick in
``The Miracle of Blossoms'' by Wilhelm Tischbein. This relates to
the time when Napoleon's armies occupied Hamburg and introduced a
reign of terror there. In May 1813, orders were given that
everything should be razed and every tree cut down in a wide swath
around the fortified city.
</P>
<P>
   Tischbein did not spell out the misery and humiliation that this
caused. Instead, he portrayed the miracle of nature by which an
apple tree, cut down at that time, managed to bloom in the spring
of 1814. This brought hope to the inhabitants _ one of whom is
touchingly portrayed by Tischbein _ that Hamburg itself might also
rise again. (And sure enough, no later than May 31, 1814, the
German armies recaptured Hamburg.)
</P>
<P>
   The look of Germany in the Age of Goethe (and after it) owed
much to the draftsmen in this show. Munich in its heyday was
largely the creation of Leo von Klenze, architect and town planner.
In the 1820s and '30s Karl Friedrich Schinkel made over the
personality of Berlin in ways that are still treasured. Draftsmen
were much befriended, moreover.
</P>
<P>
   Von Schwind as a young man in Vienna was a close friend of Franz
Schubert. Johann Christian Reinhart was a lifelong friend of
Schiller, the poet and dramatist. Another draftsman was a
brother-in-law of the composer Felix Mendelssohn.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the artists in this show also endeared themselves to
people of substance who liked to have them around in big country
houses for month after month. This, if ever, was the heyday of the
``spare man,'' and Hinrich Sieveking, in the exemplary catalog of
the present show, defines their role as a combination of
``confidant and draftsman-chronicler.''
</P>
<P>
   Everything in the show comes from the collection of a Munich
lawyer called Alfred Winterstein. He was fired up to start buying
German romantic drawings in 1927, when they were not much sought
after, and he kept at it until he died in 1976. His wife was
directly descended from a high official who was also a friend and
patron of one of the stars of this show, Johann Georg von Dillis
(1759-1841).
</P>
<P>
   It is von Dillis who sends the visitor home in a high good
humor. He puts before us a steep stretch of woodland. The sun
shines, the breeze exhilarates and the company is the best that
Munich could offer. There is Count Rumford, the initiator of the
English Garden in Munich. There is his friend Countess Baumgarten,
thanks to whom Munich got the premiere of Mozart's ``Idomeneo.''
</P>
<P>
   Other painters at other times would have settled for a formal
pose, but not this one. Like Henri Cartier-Bresson with his camera
200 years later, he caught his two friends when they were a little
way ahead of him and weren't looking round.
</P>
<P>
   The show also includes a very good joke. In his ``History
Painter,'' Johann Christian Reinhart makes irresistible fun of the
fashion at that time for paintings of heroic horsemen. Not only is
there no live horseman in this drawing, but there is no live horse,
either. What we see is a man painting a uniformed mannequin astride
a cloth-covered wooden stand. All is pretense, and Reinhart savored
every inch of it.
</P>
<P>
   Henry Fuseli and Adolph Menzel have top billing but serve
respectively as prelude and aftermath to the show. The gruesome
fancy of the one and the bonhomie of the other are nicely adjusted
to the task.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fuseli to Menzel: Drawings From the Age of Goethe'' remains at
the Frick Collection, 1 E. 70th St., Manhattan, through Sept. 6.

`PHOTOGRAPHS FROM SOUTH AFRICA': INTRIGUING IMAGES OBSCURED BY
TEXT 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By SARAH BOXER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ David Goldblatt sold his family's menswear business
in South Africa to become a photographer in 1962. But the pictures
he made of the nation under apartheid suggest that there was one
thing in the rag trade he refused to leave behind: the practice of
taking inventory.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibition ``David Goldblatt: Photographs From South
Africa,'' at the Museum of Modern Art, includes 46 pictures of
churches, monuments, shantytowns, apartment houses, graveyards,
toilet seats, billboards, hedges and house trimmings: a veritable
inventory of South Africa's store of goods, running from 1964 until
1993.
</P>
<P>
   Like Bernd and Hilla Becher, who photographed water towers,
blast furnaces and other quasi-architectural objects, Goldblatt is
interested in man-made things. But he is not exploring the curious
and beautiful variations on a utilitarian theme. Instead, he
practices a kind of social iconography, looking for ordinary images
that are packed with historical and sociological meaning. Goldblatt
chose to focus on unexceptional objects in South Africa, he once
said, because he was drawn ``to the quiet and commonplace, where
nothing `happened' and yet all was contained and immanent.''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, all is not contained and immanent in these
images. Many of the pictures cry out for explanation, and their cry
is answered with a torrent of text. Every photograph is supported
by a few hundred words. Sometimes the text helps, turning what are
cool, uninflected pictures into illustrations of the twisted social
relations and hideous inequalities of apartheid. Sometimes, though,
the text is just a tidal wave in which the sought-for crucial
information drowns.
</P>
<P>
   The successes in this show are the mystifying objects that yield
to explanation but retain their visual presence. For example, the
exhibition opens with an odd structure that appears to have been
made out of tin ceiling tiles, corrugated metal and a small wheel.
Goldblatt explains that this is a ``Cafe-de-Move-On,'' one of the
coffee carts that African workers in Johannesburg would visit for
tea, lunch, conversation and even, occasionally, a place to sleep.
</P>
<P>
   In 1962, there were thousands of these carts, made from castoff
materials from white Johannesburg. By 1965, though, the carts, long
deplored by the government, had been destroyed. At first, Goldblatt
writes, the workers had to eat in eating houses, fish friers and
cafes, and then, beginning in the 1970s, in ``factory canteens,
long established for whites but thought by many employers to be
`unnecessary' for blacks, and which workers had resisted as being a
ploy by bosses to keep wages down.''
</P>
<P>
   Even a picture as intriguing as this, though, can suffer from
too much text. Here Goldblatt indicates clearly that the
destruction of the coffee carts was a bad thing, but then goes on
to give an opaque explanation of the significance of the opening of
the company canteen to blacks. Was it in fact social progress or
part of a ploy to keep wages down? He doesn't say.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Telling the history of a nation through its objects is
nonetheless a heroic endeavor, especially when the history goes
back thousands of years. As proof that Africans civilized the veld
thousands of years before the Europeans came, Goldblatt includes a
late-Iron Age settlement on the grasslands of the highveld: a pile
of rocks with a square crawl passage. In order to show the first
signs of separatism, he takes a picture of the hedge that was
planted at the Cape by the first European settlers in the middle of
the 17th century to keep the indigenous Khoikhoi out. A curlicue
scroll ornament on a pure white stairway at one of the richest
farms at the Cape is a sign that conspicuous consumption went all
the way back to the late 18th century.
</P>
<P>
   In the exhibition, most of the objects photographed are
apartheid-era structures. A broken toilet seat sitting in the
middle of a vast grassland is proof that many African East Cape
farmers were forced off their land and into resettlement camps that
contained no farmland but 1,500 ``long-drop'' latrines. A 1990
picture of a shiny shelter of new corrugated metal in the Transvaal
is evidence that new shacks were being built even as apartheid was
being dismantled. A 1988 real estate ad for whites in the Natal
region showing a house with an African man and his son standing in
front is the salesman's hint that the man and his son are among the
``assets'' of the house.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing was said,'' Goldblatt writes, ``but much was
implied.''
</P>
<P>
   A few of the photographs speak louder than their explanations.
One is of a bleak cemetery for white members of the security forces
killed in what was called the ``Total Onslaught,'' in the
Transvaal. It is a fenced-in area in a field, with an arched
gateway carrying the inscription ``We are for you, South Africa,''
a line from the Afrikaans national anthem. This place was clearly
supposed to honor the whites who fell fighting for apartheid; it
is, after all, called The Heroes' Acre. But because it resembles a
concentration camp gate, it slyly suggests that the fences of
apartheid were doubly oppressive, not only keeping blacks out but
also shutting whites in.
</P>
<P>
   Like Eugene Atget, who photographed Paris' deserted streets,
closed storefronts and quiet courtyards, Goldblatt rarely includes
people in his photographs. He wants each object to speak frankly
about the people who are not there to hear.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most remarkable pictures, though, reverses
Goldblatt's usual formulation of walls without people. It is of a
mother and child lying on a mattress. They appear exactly as you
would expect if they had been in the privacy of their home,
surrounded by their possessions, chairs and a table. The child is
asleep. The mother watches him. The only thing amiss is that the
walls of the shelter are gone. Mother and child are lying out in
the middle of some sand surrounded by bushes and trees.
</P>
<P>
   As Goldblatt explains, ``The shelter was a framework of Port
Jackson brushwood staked into the loose sand of the Cape Flats and
covered by plastic sheets.'' But in 1984, he continues, ``a team of
five overalled black men, supervised by an armed white, lifted the
entire structure of frame and plastic skin off the ground and
placed it nearby. Then they pulled off the plastic, smashed the
framework, and threw the pieces onto a waiting truck.'' The convoy
then ``moved toward the next group of shelters. For a while the
woman lay with the child. Then she got up and began to cut and
strip branches of Port Jackson bush to make a new framework for her
house.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though this photograph has living, breathing subjects, it
carries the same affectless quality that pervades Goldblatt's
inventory of inanimate objects. Why? One can only conclude that
this is the look of apartheid: oppressive, futile, hopelessly
still.

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Cooler and less humid air will engulf New England and the
northern Middle Atlantic states Friday as a cold front moves
offshore. Breezes from the northwest will be accompanied by
sunshine mixed with puffy clouds. A shower is possible over
interior northern New England, while locations along the coast are
dry and seasonably warm. High pressure will also grace the upper
Ohio Valley and Great Lakes with comfortable humidity levels and
ample sunshine.
</P>
<P>
   The front separating this cooler air mass from sultry air over
the South and southern Plains will be the focus for clusters of
thunderstorms from Kansas to the Carolinas. Flooding rains are
possible with some of the storms as steering winds aloft are quite
weak. Elsewhere, a pocket of cold air at 20,000 feet will lift
muggy air into towering thunderheads with tropical downpours along
the central Gulf Coast. The Florida peninsula will be drier than
recent days, as warm air aloft aids in suppressing afternoon
thunderstorms. An exception will be in southern areas where
isolated showers are possible.
</P>
<P>
   Farther west, searing heat will continue to plague interior
Texas and Oklahoma. High temperatures will be near 100 degrees in
many areas. Meanwhile, afternoon thunderstorms will develop again
as monsoon moisture remains in place over the interior Southwest.
Some of the storms will produce flooding of low-lying areas. Dry
and seasonably hot air will cover central California and interior
Washington and Oregon while low clouds cling to the coast.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Swarm of Storms
</P>
<P>
   For the past several afternoons, a swarm of scattered
thunderstorms have sprouted over the high peaks of the Rockies.
Tall mountains are ``elevated heat sources.'' That is, as the sun
heats the top of a mountain, the high ground heats the air in
contact with it. In turn, the warmed air becomes less dense
compared to the surrounding air not in contact with the mountain.
Like a hot-air balloon, the air then rises, and, if there is
sufficient moisture, blossoms into a roiling cumulus cloud. This
week, moisture has streamed northward from Mexico, providing fuel
for the swarm of storms. &QL;

`RYAN' HEADED FOR AN OSCAR? 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By BERNARD WEINRAUB   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOLLYWOOD _ Is the Oscar race already over?
</P>
<P>
   Hardly. But ask any producer, talent agent or studio executive
in town about the leading contender for the Academy Awards, and
they'll respond with three words: ``Saving Private Ryan.''
</P>
<P>
   The World War II epic, directed by Steven Spielberg, opens on
Friday but has already been preceded by the best reviews of
Spielberg's film career. Spielberg won the Academy Award in 1994
for best director for ``Schindler's List,'' which collected a total
of seven Oscars, including best picture.
</P>
<P>
   It is unusually early to speak of Academy Awards, which will be
handed out on March 21. Anything can happen. And certainly ``The
Truman Show,'' and films opening later in the year, will compete
for Oscars, too.
</P>
<P>
   But ``Saving Private Ryan,'' written by Robert Rodat and
starring Tom Hanks, seems to have the perfect Academy pedigree. Its
early reviews have been extraordinary, with the word
``masterpiece'' tossed around.
</P>
<P>
   The 2-hour 35-minute film is so emotional that some members of
the audience leave in silence and burst into tears outside the
theater. And while the movie unflinchingly depicts the blood and
terror of war, it's also unfailingly patriotic.
</P>
<P>
   The film tells the story of an eight-man unit's search for a
soldier, Private Ryan, whose three brothers have died in battle.
The group's task is to take him away from the front lines. Other
members of the cast include Matt Damon, as Private Ryan; Tom
Sizemore, and Edward Burns.
</P>
<P>
   Terry Press, the marketing chief at Dreamworks, which, with
Paramount, made ``Saving Private Ryan,'' acknowledged that it was
risky to release the film in the summer, normally a time of action,
family and escapist movies.
</P>
<P>
   November and December are the months for serious and weighty
films because critics tend to make their top-10 lists at the time,
and year-end releases are considered to be fresher in the minds of
members of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, who
nominate the films.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not kidding ourselves,'' Ms. Press said. ``It's a risk
to put it out in the summer. But we also think that audiences are
starved for something of substance in the summer. And we have
little doubt that people will remember this film at the end of the
year.''
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in 17 years, Spielberg has agreed to
undertake a nationwide tour to sell his movie, in this case to
discuss ``Private Ryan'' on television shows and in numerous other
interviews.
</P>
<P>
   Hanks and other members of the cast are also promoting the film,
which cost $63 million, as is Stephen E. Ambrose, whose historical
works on World War II were used in the research material for the
movie.
</P>
<P>
   At Ambrose's private screening of the film, he asked the
projectionist to turn it off at one point because he was so
overcome.
</P>
<P>
   Selling the movie, with its raw depiction of battlefield
violence and terror, is a delicate job. ``We have to be careful not
to mislead people that this was a soft-soap war story but also find
a way to encourage them to go and see it,'' Ms. Press said.
</P>
<P>
   Spielberg has promised the Motion Picture Association of
America, which rated the film R (anyone under 17 must be
accompanied by a parent or guardian), that he would not flinch in
discussing the level of intensity of the film. He has said in
interviews that he thinks no one under 14 should see the film.
</P>
<P>
   Its premiere in Hollywood on Tuesday night was unusual. Normally
such affairs are red-carpet events, with preening stars and a
glitzy party afterward. This one was low key, and there was no
party.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would have been inappropriate,'' Ms. Press said. &QL;

   A Spoof of the Mafia
</P>
<P>
   As a boy in Sicily, Vincenzo Cortino was driven from his home
town and forced to (italics)swim(end italics) to America. He grew
up to become a Mafia patriarch who, in his final years, must hand
over the reins of power to one of his two sons: the psychotic and
very stupid Joey or the war hero Anthony. Treachery follows.
</P>
<P>
   If this sounds familiar, well, it was designed that way. Jim
Abrahams, who helped create spoofs like ``Hot Shots,''
``Airplane!'' and ``The Naked Gun,'' has turned his focus on ``The
Godfather,'' ``Casino'' and other somber movies about the mob. The
result is ``Mafia!,'' which opens on Friday, a really silly spoof
starring Lloyd Bridges, in the Marlon Brando part, as well as Jay
Mohr, Olympia Dukakis, Christina Applegate and Billy Burke.
</P>
<P>
   Abrahams said the idea for ``Mafia!'' came to him while reading
reviews for the television series ``The Last Don.'' He recalled:
``The tone of the reviews was: `How could they recycle this stuff
again? Have they no shame?' It awakened me to the fact that here's
a genre taking itself very seriously that's just waiting to be sent
up.''
</P>
<P>
   Abrahams, who wrote the film with Greg Norberg and Michael
McManus, said he followed the pattern set by his former partnership
with his old friends David and Jerry Zucker.
</P>
<P>
   ``You write stuff that makes you laugh and cross your fingers
that you're in tune with the moviegoing audience,'' he said. What
Abrahams sought was, as he put it, ``the cliches in the genre: the
hothead son, the wise son, the revered patriarch, the WASP
girlfriend, the loyal thug corporal. They're all there.''
</P>
<P>
   Abrahams' humor masks what has been far more serious work that
has consumed him and his wife, Nancy, for more than five years. In
1993, their youngest child, Charlie, who was not yet 1, was
diagnosed with a severe form of epilepsy, which, if unchecked,
causes severe mental retardation.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors prescribed anticonvulsant drugs and brain surgery, but
nothing stopped the child's seizures, which took place up to 100
times a day.
</P>
<P>
   Desperate, the Abrahams began their own research at medical
libraries and discovered a ketogenic diet _ high fat, high protein,
low carbohydrate _ that had been used since the 1920s to treat
epilepsy. The Abrahams and their son flew to Johns Hopkins Hospital
in Baltimore, one of the few hospitals in the United States that
administer the diet. Within days, the boy's seizures stopped.
</P>
<P>
   Abrahams later used his experience to direct Meryl Streep in a
1997 ABC television drama, ``... First Do No Harm,'' a true story
about a mother who struggles to save her son from epilepsy when she
learns about the little-known diet.
</P>
<P>
   Abrahams said doctors often didn't pay much attention to the
diet, and brushed off its impact on epilepsy cases as merely
anecdotal evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Five years later, Abrahams' son is doing well. ``Even talking
about it now, years later, I can feel the hair raised on the back
of my neck,'' the 54-year-old filmmaker said. ``When your kid is
having a seizure, and you're desperate, these arguments are
idiotic.'' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   The era of movie musicals is over. But Hollywood studios are
preparing adaptations of two well-known stage musicals that, if
successful, could open the way for a resurgence of the genre.
</P>
<P>
   One is ``Dreamgirls,'' the 1981 musical directed and
choreographed onstage by Michael Bennett, about a singing group
like the Supremes that rises from the ghetto to national fame in
the 1960s. The movie adaptation, to be directed by Joel Schumacher,
is tentatively set to start production next year.
</P>
<P>
   The producers are David Geffen, one of the stage producers, and
Warner Brothers. Lauren Hill, lead singer of the Fugees, is the
leading contender for the role of Deena Jones, the Diana Ross-like
lead.
</P>
<P>
   Schumacher, director of ``Batman'' and ``A Time to Kill,'' said
``Dreamgirls'' is hardly like the old-style MGM musical.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're telling a story of people who perform in clubs and
theaters and sing for a living,'' he said. ``The music is
integrated into their rehearsals, their performances. No one walks
down the middle of the street singing, `I love you.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, ``Chicago,'' the John Kander-Fred Ebb-Bob Fosse 1975
musical, which was successfully revived on Broadway in 1996 and is
still playing, is set to be turned into a movie next year. The film
will star Goldie Hawn as Roxie Hart, a former chorine charged with
the murder of her lover, the part played by Ann Reinking in the
revival, and Madonna as Velma Kelly, Roxie's murderous rival, the
Bebe Neuwirth role.
</P>
<P>
   Nicholas Hytner, who recently staged Lincoln Center's ``Twelfth
Night,'' is the director. The story is a corrosively funny fable
set mostly in the Cook County jail in the 1920s.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the perfect time for `Chicago,' _ it's edgy, dark and
provocative,'' said Laurence Mark, one of the producers of the
film, which will be released by Miramax.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, Hollywood musicals have fared unevenly.
Disney's 1992 effort at a live-action musical, ``Newsies,'' grossed
a disastrous $2.8 million. But earlier this year, Paramount's
reissue of ``Grease,'' originally released in 1978, was a success,
grossing $12.7 million in its opening weekend, coming in second
after ``Titanic.'' Overall, the ``Grease'' reissue took in $28.4
million, according to Exhibitor Relations Co. Inc., which monitors
box office figures.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just think that this is a genre waiting to be reinvented,''
Mark said.

RENO, RILEY DEPLORE CONGRESS' REJECTION OF GUN LEGISLATION 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOHN C. HENRY 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Attorney General Janet Reno and Education Secretary
Richard Riley on Thursday lamented Congress' rejection of
legislation that would hold adults criminally responsible for
failing to keep guns away from minors who use the weapons in
crimes.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate vote against the legislation was ``the defeat of just
a common-sense, reasonable solution to make sure that guns are not
accessible to children,'' Reno said during a news conference with
Riley. They previewed an anti-youth violence advertisement that
features images from recent fatal schoolyard shootings.
</P>
<P>
   By a 69-31 vote, the Senate late Wednesday turned back a
proposal that had been endorsed by President Clinton to make it a
federal offense if an adult does not securely store a gun that a
minor later uses to shoot someone.
</P>
<P>
   The measure, sponsored by Sen. Richard J. Durbin, D-Ill., would
have imposed a maximum year in prison and a $10,000 fine on anyone
convicted under the new law. Durbin tried to add the gun safety
proposal to a $33 billion spending bill for the Justice, Commerce
and State departments.
</P>
<P>
   Arguing that parents should not be prosecuted for crimes
committed by their children, Sen. Larry Craig, R-Idaho, persuaded
his colleagues to instead expand a test program designed to combat
youth crime and to increase prosecution of people who illegally
deliver weapons to youths.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we can make parents criminals,'' said Craig, a
board member of the National Rifle Association. He argued that
Durbin's measure ``would take the victim who had his or her firearm
stolen and make him the criminal.''
</P>
<P>
   The Durbin measure, co-sponsored by Sen. John Chafee, R-R.I.,
did not apply to firearms stolen through an illegal entry or
break-in. The Durbin-Chafee proposal was similar to a law in Texas
and 14 other states that provide criminal penalties for adults who
allow children unsupervised access to firearms.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Senate Republicans defeated an effort by Democrats
to require all handguns sold in the United States to be equipped
with child safety locks. Senators approved an alternative proposal,
which also was offered by Craig, to require gun dealers to make the
safety devices available. At the same time, the Craig proposal
would not penalize dealers who fail to stock the devices.
</P>
<P>
   Reno and Riley said the administration was not giving up on
tightening restrictions. ``Reasonable people ought to see this
really as a child safety issue, and that's how we hope it goes
forward,'' Riley said.
</P>
<P>
   The ad previewed by Reno and Riley begins with the image of a
pistol being fired as the folk group Peter, Paul and Mary sing
``Where Have All The Flowers Gone?'' The ad continues with the
number of shooting victims _ dead and wounded _ in Jonesboro, Ark.,
Pearl, Miss., and Springfield, Ore., scrolling across the screen.
</P>
<P>
   The ad draws to a close with a crying child embracing a fellow
survivor of a campus shooting and the end of the song's lyrics:
``Where have all the children gone? Gone to graveyards one by one.
Oh, when will we ever learn?''
</P>
<P>
   Riley said a review of the campus shootings found a greater need
for adults to talk more to children. ``One of the saddest findings
to come out of all these killings is that many young people in the
school were aware that something was going on and they didn't
involve adults in that conversation,'' he said.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ To the bikers, bladers and joggers cruising along the
path next to the West Side Highway, it had to look like a scene
from the Elvis film ``Blue Hawaii,'' as directed by Fellini. More
than 200 paddlers in bikinis or baggy print shorts, sandals and
shades milled about a flotilla of 45-foot outrigger canoes on Pier
25, which juts into the Hudson River in the shadow of the World
Trade Center. A fiberglass iguana, as big as an outrigger and
mounted to a trailer where a Brazilian artist sculptures the wood
pilings he finds floating in the Hudson, stares ominously over the
West Side Highway.
</P>
<P>
   This aquatic anomaly _ urban outrigging _ was nonexistent in New
York City until three years ago. But the Liberty World Challenge, a
15-mile paddling marathon, now in its second year, has already
become the sport's premier event on the East Coast, drawing dozens
of teams from outrigger hot beds like Hawaii and California, as
well as Vermont, Maine and Canada, where outrigger sightings were
once as common as UFOs.
</P>
<P>
   Were it not for the opening credits on ``Hawaii Five-O,'' where
a six-man canoe surges down the face of an angry wave, few North
Americans would ever have seen one of these incredibly seaworthy
Polynesian craft. The basic design has not changed in 1,500 years:
the outrigger, or ama, an upward-curved stabilizing arm that
resembles an elephant's tusk, is lashed on the port side of the
canoe to wood beams called iako. The original models were carved
out of massive koa trees. While the fastest craft are now molded
fiberglass, koa canoes, which can cost $25,000, are still made and
raced.
</P>
<P>
   Prehistoric Hawaiian outriggers were used for fishing,
transportation, war and racing. Racing was serious business. A
competitor might wager his land, possessions, wife or even his life
on the outcome. Tommy Holmes, author of ``The Hawaiian Canoe''
(Editions Limited, 1993), writes, ``In its import, the canoe stands
to ancient Polynesian culture as the invention of the wheel to
ground transportation, as the spaceship to man's spirit.''
</P>
<P>
   In Hawaii, where there are roughly 60 outrigger clubs, the
spiritual element of canoeing remains strong. A Hawaiian priest
(kahuna) drapes leis around new koa canoes and blesses them before
the members of the club. Sheila Beahm, a pilot for Aloha Airlines
and longtime paddler, says, ``Sometimes in a close race a steersman
will chant, `Mana, mana,' which means spiritual power, almost as if
they were appealing to the life force of the boat itself.''
</P>
<P>
   How the Liberty Cup came to New York City is another story
entirely. Roger Meyer, an Upper West Side resident who has spent
the last 15 years kayaking in the Hudson, saw an outrigger for the
first time in 1994 in Long Island Sound near Norwalk, Conn.
Thinking that racing such a craft afforded a great athletic
challenge, he decided to start a team.
</P>
<P>
   Bringing outrigger paddling to Manhattan was only slightly less
difficult than finding beach volleyball players at the Arctic
Circle. But Meyer, who at one time or another has been fanatical
about running, gymnastics and hockey, went to gyms in the city and
countless canoe races in New England and asked anyone with a broad
back if they wanted to try paddling the six-man outrigger he had
chained to a log on the Long Island Sound in Connecticut. I was one
of his early recruits.
</P>
<P>
   In October 1996, operating on the ``build it and they will
come'' principle, Meyer hauled a six-seat outrigger into Manhattan
and eventually found a home for his $8,000 canoe at Pier 63, near
the Chelsea Piers Equestrian Center on 23rd Street. The 35-year-old
graphic designer then bought a dock, one- and two-man outrigger
canoes (light, tippy 25-foot outriggers used for training and
racing), and the New York Outrigger Club, which now has roughly 50
members, was born.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Meyer staged his first Liberty Cup. Fourteen crews
showed up, a solid turnout for a first-year event. While the sport
is part of the social fabric in Hawaii and popular in southern
California, it has just taken hold on the East Coast and seems to
be spreading at a healthy clip, recreationally and competitively.
</P>
<P>
   While I missed the first Liberty Cup, I signed on for the
second. Meyer told me that there would be 36 crews _ 14 of them
women in a separate race _ including an all-star collection of
Hawaiians. So a month before the race we met weekly to train.
</P>
<P>
   Our first paddle together on a Tuesday afternoon in May was
memorable. Heading south on the Hudson on a two-man outrigger into
a 15-knot wind, Meyer showed me the three phases of the
single-blade stroke: the entry or catch, the pull or draw, and exit
or recovery. We'd start on opposite sides of the boat, take 10 to
15 strokes with our ultralight, bent-shaft carbon fiber paddles and
change sides when he shouted ``Hut!'': canoe-speak for switch. As a
competitive kayaker, I was fit and had boat skills, but unlike
double-blade paddling, the canoe stroke was different enough to
make me feel nearly like a beginner.
</P>
<P>
   Things were going well until we turned with the wind and began
surfing back, only to find a wall of storm clouds hurtling our way.
Before you could say ``the Intrepid,'' the sky turned black and the
stiff south wind collided with stronger gusts from the north,
causing the river to haystack like a washing machine gone mad.
Paddling furiously, we sought shelter from the vicious lightning at
Engine Company 1 on a pier a dozen blocks south of Pier 63. Sipping
coffee in the cozy station house, we watched 60-mile-an-hour winds
rake the river and listened to tales of the rescues they'd made on
the mercurial Hudson.
</P>
<P>
   That was practice. The race itself came on a hot Saturday in
June. My teammates and I were an eclectic bunch: two from Guam, two
from Canada and two New Yorkers. Officially, we were called the New
England Free Agents, but our steersmen, Grafton Howard, a beefy
Bronx native who has lived in the South Pacific for the last 20
years, called our boat Paluman Tasi, a Guamanian word which means
sea bird.
</P>
<P>
   At noon, when the starter's horn blasted to begin the men's
race, 132 paddlers in 22 400-pound boats hammered south on the
wind-swept Hudson. The explosion of water, the din of a hovering
helicopter, the echoed cry of ``hut!'' from competing crews and the
drone of the escort boats that led the contingent around the tip of
Manhattan made it the most exciting _ and novel _ start to any boat
race I'd been in.
</P>
<P>
   Having only paddled as a team briefly that morning, we struggled
to find a rhythm. While the basic technique is relatively simple,
the art of paddling is in the feel and timing. The length of the
draw and force applied during the power phase of the stroke
determines how fast the canoe travels. Miss a beat and the boat
slows, as they say in Hawaii, ``like a caterpillar with a broken
leg.''
</P>
<P>
   As we headed past the South Street Seaport up the East River,
Team Hawaii, a Who's Who of single-blade steam engines, led the
field in the direction toward New York Harbor. Tanned, tattooed,
with backs as broad as barn doors, they moved as one, paddling so
smoothly it looked leisurely. Giving chase was Manu'iwa, a
collection of East Coast hot-shots paddling like galley slaves
carrying ice to an emperor.
</P>
<P>
   As the two crews moved around Governors Island, Manu'iwa
surprised themselves and Team Hawaii by closing the gap. Blake
Conant, a 44-year-old steersman and native Hawaiian living in
Connecticut, sensed the surge of adrenaline in his boat and tried
to hold them back. ``The analogy,'' he said, ``is that they're my
horses, and I just tried to keep them calm and make sure we stayed
smooth.''
</P>
<P>
   While the top two crews battled back and forth, we chopped
through the turbulent water in the middle of the pack.
Occasionally, we'd click and surge on the boat ahead of us; this
inspired us, gave us more momentum, and our vessel would pick up
yet again as if we were headed downhill. Other times, we were out
of sync and felt like the proverbial hobbled caterpillar.
</P>
<P>
   Concentrating on the task at hand was a challenge. In addition
to staying in rhythm, we constantly had to shift our weight to keep
from flipping in the rough water. For much of the race I couldn't
stop thinking about the pain in my lower back and shoulders. The
sweeping lines of the Brooklyn Bridge and skyline of Lower
Manhattan were also distracting. Trying to focus, I stared at the
lumpy muscles of the Canadian's back in front of me, or at the
blade of the fellow from Guam in Seat 2. Still, there was the
marauding Staten Island Ferry to worry about. And as we rounded
Ellis Island and the Statue of Liberty, I caught myself daydreaming
about my grandparents, who came to America 100 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   We finished 10th in 2 hours 21 minutes, exhausted _ not quite
exalted _ but thoroughly pleased to have fought hard and done
something memorable. Team Hawaii, the heavy favorite, edged
Manu'iwa by a mere 48 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   First, second or 10th, each crew was engaged in the elusive
search for that perfect rhythm, the synchronized application of
power where six individuals work as one. ``Staying in that
groove,'' said Conant, `is what outrigger paddling is all about.''

`MONIQUE'S KINDERGARTEN': SIMPLICITY AND SERENITY 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Exhibit notes are at end of review) 
(mk) 
 By MARGARETT LOKE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Like a late-20th-century Atget, the British-born
photographer Michael Kenna insists on seeing the quietly luminous
in landscapes molded by the human hand. Atget had a gift for
evoking the human presence in his photographs of Paris without
showing a single soul. And Kenna, too, suggests the human presence
in pictures taken at night or in the early morning _ at the Rouge
steel plant in Dearborn, Mich., for instance, or at the gardens in
France designed by Andre le Notre, the great 17th-century French
landscape architect _ when there is no one around.
</P>
<P>
   In Kenna's recently completed series of photographs of a Waldorf
kindergarten in San Francisco, currently on view at the Robert Mann
Gallery on the Upper East Side, one might expect his signature
black-and-white calm and elegance shattered by clamoring, frenetic
kindergartners. But one would be wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Seen through Kenna's still lifes of the objects the preschoolers
use or play with, the world in the series ``Monique's
Kindergarten'' is Shaker-like in its serenity, simplicity and
attention to design detail. The children may be absent _ the
photographs were taken on Sunday mornings or in the evenings _ but
their presence is almost palpably felt.
</P>
<P>
   ``Monique'' in the exhibition's title is Monique Grund, who
taught at a Waldorf school in France before she came to San
Francisco in 1978 to start the kindergarten, which has since grown
into an elementary and high school.
</P>
<P>
   The first coeducational Waldorf school opened in 1919 in
Stuttgart, Germany, founded by the Austrian philosopher and
scientist Rudolf Steiner for the children of employees at the
Waldorf-Astoria cigarette factory. Integrating the arts with
academics, the private, nonsectarian school offered equal education
for all children, whether they were headed for trade or the
university. Since then, hundreds of Waldorf schools have opened
around the world.
</P>
<P>
   In the exhibition's companion book, published by Nazraeli Press,
Ms. Grund explains that through carefully selected objects, she
helps kindergartners, many of whom are used to sitting passively in
front of television sets, learn to play and imagine.
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1980s, one of Ms. Grund's kindergartners was Kenna's
daughter, Olivia. Picking her up at school one day, Kenna was asked
by Ms. Grund to take color pictures of the kindergarten, so she
could send them to her family in France.
</P>
<P>
   While he was there on a Sunday, when the kindergarten was free
of the hubbub of children, Kenna discovered what he describes as
``curious and delightful presences,'' the objects the children
played with. Many were made by Ms. Grund out of wool and fabric;
some, by the children themselves.
</P>
<P>
   But it wasn't until 1993, after Kenna was given a four-by-five
view camera by a photographer who no longer wanted to haul the
heavy equipment about, that he began the kindergarten series.
</P>
<P>
   He had last used a large-format camera, which requires a tripod,
when he worked as a commercial photographer more than two decades
earlier. Since then he has preferred the flexibility of the
medium-format camera, which can be hand held, for his landscape
photography. Kenna's images of parks, whether industrial or
recreational and invariably in gorgeous tones of grays and black,
are meditative studies in stillness _ metaphorically, people at
rest.
</P>
<P>
   But by using the larger, heftier, slower camera, Kenna has
created pictures of Ms. Grund's kindergarten that are striking in
their intimacy, tactility and warmth. The photographs _
sepia-toned, gelatin-silver contact prints _ are an affectionate
and affecting portrait of a world of gentle make-believe, quiet
beauty, mystery and wonder.
</P>
<P>
   Awaiting the arrival of the children, the objects seem to be in
a state of suspended animation, and yet they also seem very much
alive, like the toys in a fairy tale that come magically to life
when humans are asleep.
</P>
<P>
   So it is that an impressionistic stork in the grass might be
mistaken for the real thing. A jangle of much-used teaspoons are
the real thing, made more so by Kenna's meticulous attention to the
scratches on the spoon bowls.
</P>
<P>
   Where there are small children, cuteness usually lurks. But in
his series, Kenna firmly keeps it at bay. What saves ``Summer
Dress, 1997'' _ featuring a single diminutive sun dress on a wire
hanger that has a whimsical heart-shape center _ from cute is his
contrasting the dress with the dark tones of a solid wood frame,
from which the dress hangs, and with an unevenly shadowed wall.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, in ``Sweepity-Sweep, 1995,'' a brush whose handle is
a wooden doll wearing a conical hat is echoed on the wall by a
pointy shaft of light. And shown against an inky black backdrop,
the translucent animal in ``Paolo's Beeswax Dog'' seems to be a
walking apparition, its ghostly body reflected on the nearby smooth
surface.
</P>
<P>
   There is unexpected beauty in the ordinary. In the exquisitely
textured ``Birdhouse and Wind Chimes,'' the hard peaked roof of the
wooden birdhouse is duplicated in the soft folds of the roof of a
fabric house, and the sharply defined chimes stand in marked
contrast to the blurred lines of the backdrop folds and the pale
gray shadows beyond.
</P>
<P>
   In lieu of sweet, a number of the still lifes are strong and
austere, especially ``Morning Bells, 1994,'' with its mysterious
patches of light rising in an apex behind the bells, and ``Games in
the Sun, 1997,'' with its shadowed glass marbles.
</P>
<P>
   In this kindergarten, a peacock feather is anything but
ostentatious, and Kenna records it as a pared-down marvel, with
delicate tendrils flowing from a straight stem, atop which is a
cropped fan-shaped tuft of dark feathers.
</P>
<P>
   At times in his landscape photography, Kenna reduces what he
sees to minimalist abstractions, and in this show, ``Kinder Harp,''
too, shows an object that resembles an odd parking meter with a
transparent top and in it, thin parallel black lines. It seems that
in the silently alive Monique's kindergarten, things often have a
way of turning into something else.
</P>
<P>
   EXHIBIT NOTES:
</P>
<P>
   `Monique's Kindergarten' remains at the Robert Mann Gallery, 42
E. 76th St., Manhattan, through Aug. 14.

NET-SAVVY CAR TAKES COMPUTER FOR A RIDE 
</HEADLINE>
  (DUPLICATION WARNING: Story is also moving in the ``a'' news

(cb) 
 By MICHELLE KREBS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   DETROIT _ What's the next big thing? To judge from many of the
concept cars at this year's auto shows, it is an on-board computer
that would allow a driver or passenger to log onto the Internet to
read or send e-mail, check stock quotes or get traffic reports.
</P>
<P>
   The Chrysler Corporation wants to give customers a chance to
surf the World Wide Web, too, but it has come up with a
bring-your-own approach to computing.
</P>
<P>
   One of Chrysler's showcase concepts this year, the Dodge ESX2,
has drawn attention for its lightweight body, which could be made
of polyethylene terephthalate, or P.E.T., the material used for
plastic soda bottles, and for its hybrid powertrain, which combines
a diesel engine and an electric motor. The ESX2 also takes an
unusual approach to on-the-road computing: Instead of permanently
installing a computer with Internet access, as other manufacturers
have done, Chrysler built in a docking station for a small,
portable computer. A user would plug in his or her own computer,
then use it to call up, say, real-time traffic reports. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the ESX2, a hand-held Hewlett-Packard 620LX sits on a small
shelf in the center of the dashboard, secured by Velcro. In the
back of the computer is a Motorola module that uses an infrared
interface, similar to a television's remote control, to link the
computer to the car. Once the computer is docked in the car, the
driver can display menu choices that include the audio and climate
controls, traffic information, weather forecasts, Internet and
cellular phone connections and software that would give customers
remote control over devices at their homes, including appliances,
lights, sprinklers and security systems. A diagnostics option would
help to pinpoint any problem with the vehicle and provide
step-by-step instructions for simple repairs, like replacing a flat
tire.
</P>
<P>
   The driver selects choices from the menu by touch, though
computers like these will eventually be operated by voice commands.
</P>
<P>
   Chrysler's approach has several advantages over the permanent
installation of a computer in a vehicle, Steve Buckley, an
electronics specialist for Chrysler, said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For starters, it helps to hold down the cost of an
Internet-capable car, because built-in computers and modems add
hundreds of dollars, perhaps more than $1,000, to the purchase
price. Chrysler says the docking station would cost no more than
$100. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Hand-held computers, which have become increasingly popular
mass-market products, cost from $500 to $1,000. Most of these do
not currently come with modems for connecting to the Internet,
which add another $200 to $700.
</P>
<P>
   Flexibility is increased because the hand-held computer can do
double or triple duty: in the car, at the office, at home.
Chrysler's docking station is compatible with various computer
sizes and brands that use Microsoft's Windows CE operating system.
</P>
<P>
   And because the computer is not built in, the car would not
spend much of its useful life with an obsolete gadget imbedded in
the dashboard _ the digital equivalent of an eight-track tape deck.
The hand-held computer can be removed and replaced, its software
can be updated and features can easily be added long before the
vehicle itself is replaced. Pointing out how quickly computer
technology changes, Buckley said that within the 10 months he spent
developing the ESX2's docking station, he used three generations of
hand-held computers. Voice-recognition software was unavailable
when he started; it is now available and can be added on, which
would provide a boon to drivers who will be able to surf the Net
without looking away from the road.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm personally on my third home computer, but I can't afford
to buy a new car every time the computer technology becomes
obsolete,'' Buckley said.
</P>
<P>
   Chrysler plans to use the ESX2 to gauge consumer interest in the
in-car docking stations for hand-held computers. The module that
would make this kind of communication possible in existing
production cars and trucks could be installed as an after-market
option within two years, Chrysler said. The devices could be made
available through the company's dealerships. &QL;

 &HT;    Childress' `Gone' falters on visit to island of lost souls
 &HT;    (EMBARGOED UNTIL JULY 26: DO NOT USE BEFORE THEN)
 &HT;    By Carolyn Nizzi Warmbold
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Mark Childress has given novel readers some great moments
between book covers. In ``Crazy in Alabama'' (1993), he displayed a
genius for eliciting the grotesque and the grinnable out of our
American landscape. ``Gone for Good,'' however, is not so good,
partly because Childress strays from an American setting. On his
way to a concert, Ben ``Superman'' Willis, a super-famous rock star
in 1972, is forced to crash-land his plane on a tropical island
that is inhabited by famous people who have disappeared (Jimmy
Hoffa, Michael Rockefeller, Princess Anastasia, Amelia Earhart) or
died (Marilyn Monroe and JFK).
</P>
<P>
   Superman resists his Edenic surroundings and wants to return to
his shallow wife, a former Miss Southwest Louisiana, and his lonely
son living in Opelousas, La. Eventually, he gives in to Marilyn's
seductions for eight years. But things are not right on the island,
overseen by an unknown authority who wants to build a luxury hotel
for nefarious reasons. Superman, who learns to magically fly
without a plane, disastrously incites the population to revolt.
When his grown son comes searching for him, the result is a
``Twilight Zone'' episode gone astray.
</P>
<P>
   Childress, an Alabama native who lives in Costa Rica, is not
afraid of risks, but it's hard to grasp his view of pop culture in

 &HT;    COLUMN: Remnick's posting elicits bit of envy, and much elation
 &HT;    (EMBARGOED UNTIL JULY 26: DO NOT USE BEFORE THEN)
 &HT;    By Michael Skube
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ihave a friend, one of the most polished writers I know, who has
the misfortune of measuring the trajectory of his career against
that of David Remnick. They started out together at The Washington
Post in the early '80s, both of them unknown and untested. Remnick
was a year younger, which has made it that much harder. There are
people who cannot see their own achievements because of someone
else's shadow. And Remnick's only lengthened. His name was turning
up everywhere _ over long, richly detailed articles filed from the
former Soviet Union, in the better magazines, in The New York
Review of Books.
</P>
<P>
   My friend, whom we'll call Jack, did not begrudge him a Pulitzer
Prize, which Remnick won in 1994 for his book ``Lenin's Tomb.'' Not
that Jack wept with happiness, but there wasn't much he could say.
</P>
<P>
   So I called Jack one day recently and said, ``Well, I guess you
saw who was named editor of The New Yorker.''
</P>
<P>
   From the other end of the line I heard in a low voice his
familiar, droll ``Yes, I did'' offered in weary acceptance of fate.
</P>
<P>
   Leaving an imprint on journalism
</P>
<P>
   If it was cruel of me, it was also perversely affectionate. As
wonderful a writer as Jack is, he's not David Remnick and neither
is anyone else. Now, alas, Remnick is no longer a writer but an
editor. It is the difference between a peacock and peahen. The one
dazzles, the other only enables him to do so.
</P>
<P>
   But Remnick's dazzle was the kind that left an imprint, not the
transient flash of a showboat. He could write about seemingly
anyone and anything _ Joseph Brodsky to Michael Jordan, Ralph
Ellison to Boris Yeltsin, the Jewish Daily Forward to USA Today _
and do so with a depth and range unusual even in the best
journalism. There was firmness, not fluff, at the core.
</P>
<P>
   This, no doubt, explains the relief, even joy over his
appointment among those associated with The New Yorker. ``He's my
hero,'' Henry Louis Gates Jr., a frequent contributor, was telling
me a few months back. At the time, no one thought Tina Brown's
departure as editor was imminent.
</P>
<P>
   The approval of others, of course, doesn't assure The New
Yorker's future. Here is a magazine with a circulation of 800,000,
one whose history and distinctive typeface are synonymous with such
names as E.B. White and James Thurber, A.J. Liebling and Edmund
Wilson, and yet it's losing money. It's lost money for each of the
past 13 years, one more victim of a glutted magazine market and a
culture that expects to see celebrities on covers and smell perfume
on slick pages.
</P>
<P>
   In her seven years as editor, Brown tried to resuscitate a
magazine suffering from advanced atherosclerosis. She brought
touches of color without cheapening the magazine's appearance. She
brought more coverage of politics and pop culture. She brought to
its pages new writers, among them Remnick.
</P>
<P>
   Under Brown, The New Yorker was livelier, but it also lost a
certain heft. It's hard to recall more than a few articles of any
real consequence _ and many of those seem to have been written by
the man who, at only 39, is now editor.
</P>
<P>
   A shift to `deep reporting'
</P>
<P>
   Remnick is careful to credit the changes Brown brought. But he
also says he wants The New Yorker to thrive on more foreign
coverage and ``deep reporting,'' by which he presumably means the
meaty narratives of which he was a master. In his preface to ``The
Devil Problem and Other True Stories,'' a collection of journalism
published two years ago (much of it first appeared in The New
Yorker), he wrote:
</P>
<P>
   ``We order and excite our mental lives with stories. Mostly,
they are the same stories over and over again. The tabloids (in
print and, now, on television) have their set of stories: the
wealthy brought low, betrayal in marriage and commerce, the murder
of the innocent, the humbling of the celebrity, the ordinary man's
triumph. They differ from the novels of, say, Dreiser, or the plays
of Shakespeare, in the richness of detail, the complexity of
thought and incident, the wealth of language, but in the story of
O.J. Simpson (the tabloid story of the millennium) there were
surely elements of `An American Tragedy' and `Othello.' There are
other textures of mental life _ the analytical, the pure emotions
of lust or rage _ but stories, the telling and listening, are much
of what we are.''
</P>
<P>
   Most people have an intuitive understanding of this. History
itself is a story, etymologically and otherwise. But the media
market congregates nowadays at the shallow end of the pool, where
stories appeal only to our baser instincts. For some of us, those
waters have been getting fouled and scummy. If David Remnick can
keep The New Yorker afloat and free of the spreading bacteria,
he'll be a hero not only to his admirers but to the privately
envious.

 &HT;    COLUMN: Why fight it? The weather is what it is
 &HT;    (EMBARGOED UNTIL JULY 26: DO NOT USE BEFORE THEN)
 &HT;    By Celestine Sibley
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The old editorial writer on The Hartford (Conn.) Courant who
wrote that everybody talks about the weather but nobody does
anything about it should be living today. Nowadays everybody is
going crazy trying to conquer the weather. And I'm here to say I'm
very tired of it.
</P>
<P>
   I like weather _ all kinds _ and I have spent a lifetime
accepting it as it comes. No more. We substitute a fan for that air
conditioner in the living room since the conditioner doesn't do
anything much but whine.
</P>
<P>
   The fan blows all the papers off a table (I still haven't found
some of them) and is dangerous when the baby is around. It's the
kind of place he'd like to stick one of his pretty little pink
fingers. We try one of those reversible fans in the kitchen window,
and it ruins the air on the back porch. I move it to the back
porch, and it is so noisy, porch sitters have to rearrange their
chairs for any hope of conversation.
</P>
<P>
   At the office in July we wear sweaters. At least some of us do.
The young ones like being cold and joyfully expose their elegantly
tanned arms and legs to the arctic air that pours into our rooms
from some mysterious machine somewhere in the bowels of the
building.
</P>
<P>
   The weather prophets keep telling us how hot it is, as if we
weren't tough enough to take whatever weather comes our way. We
haven't always been comfortable, and I don't see why we should work
so hard to be comfortable now. It's July, for goodness' sake. Go
swimming, eat watermelon, sit on the porch and fan.
</P>
<P>
   The old Atlanta Constitution building on the corner of Alabama
and Forsyth streets aimed to be modern, although it was a wonderful
old Victorian pile with cupolas and elegant touches of marble on
its red brick exterior. Cool off the hired hands, somebody
directed, and they brought in oscillating fans and put them on
little shelves high up on the posts that held the floor above up.
</P>
<P>
   They didn't do much to cool us. The windows were open, and hot
air and train smoke blew in. But they were cheerful with their
little songs, and when you were struggling for a lead you could
turn your head back and forth with the rhythm of the oscillator.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody we knew in Mobile County when I was a child had an
electric fan _ and a lot of them didn't even have electricity. We
happened to have that from a waterwheel in the mill, but we didn't
use it up and wear it out trying to be cool. We sat on the open
porch and fanned and doused ourselves with oil of citronella to
ward off mosquitoes.
</P>
<P>
   A woman friend of mine said the other night, ``Whatever happened
to sweat?'' She wasn't talking about the kind that dews your brow
when you work in the yard or take a walk down the road. She
specified the kind that stained shirts and blouses and ruined your
new pongee frock when you walked down the street in the summertime.
I'm sure it's out there, but it has a lot to combat when all those
walkers come out of air-conditioned buildings numb with cold and
duck into their air-conditioned cars.
</P>
<P>
   All this will pass, I know. We'll have storms and floods and
cold winter winds one of these days. And I suppose we'll fight
nature's bounty there in our zeal to get comfortable. I have a
notion we should feel the weather, should be hot when it's hot and
cold when it's cold and wet when it rains.
</P>
<P>
   That comes from the old Mobile sea captain of whom I've written
before. He gave me his slogan. He ignored storm warnings and sailed
the Gulf of Mexico when he had business to do so. His slogan: ``God
makes the weather and I make the trips.''

 &HT;    Jermaine Dupri: On the record about ...
 &HT;    (EMBARGOED UNTIL JULY 26: DO NOT USE BEFORE THEN)
 &HT;    By Sonia Murray
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   His background
</P>
<P>
   Jermaine Dupri was born Jermaine Mauldin, the son of Michael and
Tina Mauldin, Sept. 23, 1972, in Asheville, N.C. They moved to
Atlanta when he was 3. When his parents divorced, Jermaine took his
mother's maiden name. (But his black and gray monogrammed towels
bear the initials JDM.)
</P>
<P>
   The woman in his life
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been in an off and on situation for like a while ... like
at least five years. Basically I just live like a bachelor. But
every man has got somebody that he always sees regardless if
they're single or not.''
</P>
<P>
   How he came up with Usher's triple-platinum `My Way'
</P>
<P>
   ``I did things like listen to him talk on the phone to girls. I
wanted Usher to sound on record like he sounded in real life. So I
studied his life, took him to strip clubs, I might have corrupted
him or whatever, but it had to all go together. It all went into
this image me and (LaFace co-president Antonio) L.A. (Reid) had for
Usher as this Bobby Brown kind of star.''
</P>
<P>
   What `1472' is
</P>
<P>
   J is the 10th letter in the alphabet, D is the fourth. Added
together you get 14, and '72 is the year Dupri was born. ``But it
means more than that,'' he explains. ``The whole concept behind my
record is 1472 is like a city that I basically feel I live in. It's
a world centered around myself that people enter into to change
their lives. Then the movie, `The City of 1472' (still in
development), will follow my record. And the idea for the movie is
pretty much like `The Wiz,' where I'm the Wizard of Oz and instead
of the city being filled with emeralds and whatever, mine is filled
with gold and platinum dreams.''
</P>
<P>
   In the works
</P>
<P>
   A Harlem World album, including Mase (``Feels So Good''), is due
in October, followed by the third release from the first female sn
between, Dupri plans to make time to work with one artist outside
his label, Whitney Houston.

 CRUISE-COX &HT;    `Cruise to Nowhere'
 &HT;    (EMBARGOED UNTIL JULY 26: DO NOT USE BEFORE THEN)
 &HT;    By Anne Rochell
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW ORLEANS -- In the Show Lounge of the Enchanted Capri cruise
ship on a Friday afternoon, a grandmother swirls her beige bra in
the air to the cheers of a rowdy crowd of heartlanders and Bible
Belters.
</P>
<P>
   Mind you, this is before the cross-dressing fashion show or the
virgin sacrifices. Before I'm served eggdrop soup with Vienna
sausages floating in it. I haven't yet heard the very, very
international staff sing ``Hoppy Bur-day'' in perfect monotone for
the 15th time in the dining room. And the on-board casino, the
raison d'etre for this seabound bacchanal, hasn't even opened yet.
</P>
<P>
   Later, I realized that gambling is about the most wholesome
activity the Enchanted Capri has to offer.
</P>
<P>
   But let's start at the beginning. A few hours earlier, this ship
left New Orleans for what's known in the gaming industry as a
``Cruise to Nowhere,'' a two-day excursion into international
waters, where gambling can go on without a state license. That's a
real plus when sailing out of Louisiana, where the number of gaming
licenses is capped at 15 statewide.
</P>
<P>
   Cruises to Nowhere are new to these parts, but they have been
setting sail from Florida's ports for several years, and one now
leaves from New York City.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've gained popularity as
</P>
<P>
   gambling has picked up as a mainstream pastime as a more
legitimate way to spend money,'' says Les McMackin, marketing
director for Casino America, which operates four Isle of Capri
Casinos in the South _ and one on board the Enchanted Capri.
</P>
<P>
   To be fair, this is my first cruise, so I have nothing to
compare it to. And part of the weirdness of this particular cruise
is due to some glitches that still need fixing. This is only the
second month the Enchanted Capri has been afloat. No doubt the
dining room staff, virtuallyouldn't communicate with each other
during an emergency drill. On one of the first sails, the crew
loaded bags of garbage into the cargo hold instead of luggage and
forgot the keys to many of the cabins.
</P>
<P>
   ``Problems with the language? That would be an understatement,''
says McMackin.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, he notes, although rigorous staff training is starting
to pay off, he's not ready to offer complimentary trips to his Isle
of Capri high rollers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to make a good impression when they come on board,''
he says.
</P>
<P>
   Head goes here
</P>
<P>
   After setting sail at 3 p.m. _ an hour late _ I stuff myself at
the lunch buffet, settle into my first frozen drink and seek out an
English-speaking crew member to ask when we will reach
international waters. To everyone's surprise, the answer is 10 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a long time,'' huffs Calmeater Jones, who flew in from
Chicago to meet her sister _ Janie Hicks of New Orleans _ for the
cruise. Hicks takes a look at the casino and declares it rather
puny.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was gonna take up more of the ship,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   It may look small, especially with the lights off, but there are
200 slot machines, several black jack tables and a craps table. All
that for 230 cabins _ a much higher ratio than you'll find on a
regular cruise ship, assures McMackin.
</P>
<P>
   But what to do until 10 p.m.?
</P>
<P>
   Back to grandma and her bra. Cruise Director Walter Elvy has
corralled everyone into the Show Lounge for ``Afternoon Madness,''
a sort of raunchy scavenger hunt. Passengers gather into teams and
deliver what Elvy requests.
</P>
<P>
   ``I need a lipstick!'' he shouts, and teams dig through purses
and stampede forward, tubes in hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``I need the shirt off a man's back, and he has to keep it off
for the rest of the game!''
</P>
<P>
   T-shirts and golf shirts fly over heads, unleashing beer bellies
of mythic proportions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now I need a warm, worn bra, and the woman who was wearing
it's gotta bring it up,'' Elvy says, his voice turning slightly
sinister. His crowd falls into a daquiri-induced frenzy. Women of
all ages and sizes lunge at him, struggling out of their bras while
barely keeping their shirts on.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm gonna give away a bottle of champagne to the largest bra
in the house!''
</P>
<P>
   There are several contenders, including Grandma, who performs a
mini burlesque show as she wiggles out of her 38C. But another
woman has this contest sewn up. She walks up, chest rolling like
waves, and presents Elvy with the prize winner _ a 44D in light
blue denim.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whoah! Right here baby!'' he shouts, waving the bra in the
air. ``Now, I wanna see a man in a bra, earrings and lipstick, and
his shirt's gotta be off!''
</P>
<P>
   There is no shortage of men in the audience game enough for this
test. After being strapped into borrowed underclothes, the men
parade around like Shriners at a lingerie sale.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanna see a VIRGIN!''
</P>
<P>
   College girls bounce up, smiling as chastely as they can. One
woman comes forward, her 8-year-old daughter in tow.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now here's a virgin! Who wants her?'' Elvy says. The little
girl smirks and runs back to her seat.
</P>
<P>
   Oh the humanity. Children aren't allowed in the casino, but they
can be sacrificed to a hungry crowd of gamblers-in-waiting. A woman
in the front row sums it up:
</P>
<P>
   ``This is better than the Jerry Springer Show!''
</P>
<P>
   Head goes here
</P>
<P>
   Wanna sober up quick? Try a ``muster drill.'' After Elvy's
games, the loud speakers announce that passengers must return to
their cabins, don bulky orange life vests, and proceed to an
assigned deck. Gives you a new appreciation for the passive
emergency run-through you get on an airplane. All 400 of us stand
in the scorching sun _ without our drinks, by the way, because we
were instructed to leave them behind _ and line up, women and
children first. We are still on the river, but the oil refineries
have disappeared and swampland surrounds us as we make our way down
the last fingers of land that stretch off of south Louisiana. The
open sea can't be far off.
</P>
<P>
   I look down at my vest and notice a hammer and sickle emblem and
the letters ''USSR.'' I later find out the folks steering and
engineering this ship are Ukranian. I try to talk to one who is
doing maintenance work on the bow. He looks at me dazed: ``No
English.''
</P>
<P>
   Head goes here
</P>
<P>
   ``On regular cruise ships, casinos are a diversion as opposed to
a destination,'' says Jim Sullivan, head of Commodore Cruise Lines,
the boat part of this casino/boat joint venture. ``On this ship,
the casino is a much more significant part of the trip. This is a
new formula and we have created a tremendous amount of synergy
combining what the casino people do well with what we do well.''
</P>
<P>
   Synergy. Cool. I check my watch. Almost time for dinner!
</P>
<P>
   In the dining room _ think Soviet banquet hall meets hospital
cafeteria _ I see that everyone has made up for lost drinking time
since the muster drill. Dominating our side of the room is a table
of eight 20-something girls from Lafayette, La., who have lost all
capacity to talk in normal voices and are screaming at each other
and everyone else. They've also taken to calling their waiter,
Jesus from the Dominican Republic, by the American pronunciation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's Hey-soos,'' he begs.
</P>
<P>
   But they bellow, ``JESUS! More wine over here, hey! JESUS
CHRIST, more rolls!!!''
</P>
<P>
   I am at a more sedate table.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have five children,'' says Earline Caruso, with a big
smile. She tells us she's from a suburb of New Orleans. Her
husband, Steve, nods. She mentions the size of her family 25 times
over the course of the trip.
</P>
<P>
   David Wagner, a quiet psychologist in a wing-collared tuxedo
shirt with sequined saxophones at the button holes, used to be a
professional gambler. ``I paid my way through graduate school in
illegal card games around New Orleans,'' he says. He shares a nice
little story about a woman who had a heart attack during a game
many years ago. And how the other players suggested putting her out
in the street before calling 911, so they wouldn't get busted.
``Instead, we just hid the cards and pretended we were having a
birthday party,'' he says. ``She was fine.''
</P>
<P>
   It's about 9:30 p.m. when the waiters parade through the dining
room with flaming baked Alaskas on their heads, singing ``Ole Ole
Ole Ole!'' They run out of the dessert before getting to our table.
Apparently an entire table didn't even get their entrees.
</P>
<P>
   But who cares? The casino has opened!
</P>
<P>
   The machines are singing. Bells are ringing. The smoke is thick.
The machines are paying out, and players are squealing delightedly
with good frequency.
</P>
<P>
   In 20 minutes at the black jack table, Wagner wins enough to
cover the price of his cruise ticket _ $150.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know when to stop,'' he says coolly. He may know, but he
doesn't stop _ he plays the rest of the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Calmeater Jones wins $900 the first night. Earline Caruso wins
$300, enough to buy Nintendo for her kids. ``I love my kids,'' she
says, pulling the handle on the ``Filthy Rich'' slot machine.
</P>
<P>
   I lose $20 in two minutes. I don't want to talk about it.
</P>
<P>
   While the Carusos, Wagner and most other cruisers burn out and
go to bed around midnight, the hard core gamblers press on.
</P>
<P>
   Elaine Magill from Lawrence, Kansas, plays until 2 a.m. and is
up again at 4 a.m., going back and forth between the craps table
and the slot machines.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just fun, and my husband's so noisy, I couldn't sleep,''
she says.
</P>
<P>
   And how's her luck?
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, just up and down.''
</P>
<P>
   Around 8:30 a.m. on Saturday, Magill's husband, daughter and
son-in-law have come into the casino and stand behind her.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think my breakfast team has arrived,'' she says. ``I'll be
right there.''
</P>
<P>
   They hesitate, then leave her. She throws the dice a few more
times, then goes to breakfast.
</P>
<P>
   ``See you later,'' says the dealer, Janice Spraggons of England.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure you will!''
</P>
<P>
   John Springer from Houston plays most of the night too. He built
his own craps table at home, says his wife, Rhonda.
</P>
<P>
   ``We practice all the time,'' she says. ``He does all the fancy
stuff. I just roll.''
</P>
<P>
   Angelique Rushing, from Gonzalez, Louisiana, plays long and late
as well.Though she says she doesn't really know how to play craps _
she just rolls the dice _ the chips begin to stack up in front of
her.
</P>
<P>
   By Saturday afternoon, far from shore in the Gulf of Mexico,
luck dries up.
</P>

   Jones loses the $900 she won last night. Rushing loses as well.
``Still up and down,'' says Magill, but she sounds a lot more down
than up.
</P>
<P>
   It's a little quieter at dinner Saturday; hangovers and losses
are having a subduing effect.
</P>
<P>
   But there are an unusual number of birthdays in the room. The
waiters have to rush from one table to the next, barely having time
to run into the kitchen and dip into what must be an endless supply
of sprinkle-covered birthday cakes. I overhear someone admit their
birthday was actually last month. I wonder aloud if maybe all this
practice will help the staff find the proper key. Then, just to
entertain myself, I order up a cake for the Carusos, who told me
their anniversary was last month.
</P>
<P>
   The cake comes with ``Happy Birthday'' written on it, but the
staff does remember to say ``Anniversary'' in their song. The
Carusos seem genuinely touched.
</P>
<P>
   Head goes here
</P>
<P>
   By 11 p.m. Saturday, we are approaching Louisiana waters. I am
in the casino, figuring the management will be dragging compulsive
gamblers out by their collars. But apparently, most folks have
already had enough. Or perhaps the ship's other activities have
become more alluring. The action tonight is outside by the pool,
where Elvy is running Conga lines and limbo contests.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday morning, I wake up and look out my window. The French
Quarter drifts by. Home at last.
</P>
<P>
   This weekend may sound like ``The Love Boat'' meets ``The
Twilight Zone.'' But I'm already making plans for a return trip.
</P>
<P>
   The Enchanted Capri sails from New Orleans every Friday.
Reservations required. Cost, per cabin, for two nights at sea and
all meals, ranges from $159-$499. Information: 800-843-4753.

 &HT;    Record exec Dupri takes mike on solo `Life in 1472'
 &HT;    (EMBARGOED UNTIL JULY 26: DO NOT USE BEFORE THEN)
 &HT;    By Sonia Murray
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- There's real life and then there are rap lyrics.
</P>
<P>
   But with Jermaine Dupri _ the man whom MTV calls ``the mayor of
Atlanta'' and whom Mariah Carey goes to for hits _ there appears to
be little difference.
</P>
<P>
   The interview begins. Dupri switches on the radio in his BMW
735i. And as if his life were being orchestrated by the
manipulative director in ``The Truman Show,'' Dupri's voice, on his
current No. 17 single, ``Money Ain't a Thing,'' just happens to be
on:
</P>
<P>
   ``In the Ferrari or Jaguar switching four lanes with the top
down, screaming out, `Money Ain't a Thing.'''
</P>
<P>
   Most rappers boast about the platinum Rolex and Land Rover they
don't have. Dupri _ already a millionaire _ has had a few of each.
He's been a successful producer for more than five years _ with
acts ranging from R&AMP;B's latest sensation Usher to Da Brat, the
first female rapper to sell a million albums. He's president of the
Atlanta-based So So Def record label. And now, with the release
last week of his first solo album, ``Life in 1472,'' he's a rapper.
</P>
<P>
   There are going to be benefits.
</P>
<P>
   And behind the two gates that lead to his Fayetteville home,
voila, benefits.
</P>
<P>
   The red Land Rover Dupri actually owns is near the entrance to
the pool. That's just behind the large but comfortable house he
shares with his mother, Tina. It's just up the street, by the way,
from Evander Holyfield's, er, home.
</P>
<P>
   The aforementioned Ferrari (this one's black) is backed against
the open three-car garage, where his Rottweilers are caged and two
of his racks of clothes are housed. The camel colored Jaguar XJ6
convertible is opposite the Land Rover, next to the white
convertible Porsche.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, and when Dupri extends his hand to greet you on this day
it's with a tattooed arm lit up at the wrist by a platinum Rolex.
</P>
<P>
   In his lingo, money ain't a thang. But respect is.
</P>
<P>
   The release of ``Life in 1472,'' ``is kind of just to show
people I can do this,'' says the 25-year-old Dupri, switching lanes
on I-85 north.
</P>
<P>
   ``People just don't know all the things I've done,'' he
continues in a tone that's more ``oh well'' than cocky. ``People
always want to foil me ...''
</P>
<P>
   ``Foil'' is a verb Dupri uses often. A certain music magazine
didn't want to put him on the cover because they ``wanted to foil
me like I don't have a history in this business.'' Rap Sheet did
put him on the cover, but with the dubious headline ``The Hardest
Working Producer You Don't Know.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not underappreciated. Anybody in this world, this Puffy
world, is underappreciated,'' says Keith Clinkscales, president of
Vibe magazine, referring to the omnipresent producer-rapper-label
president and Dupri peer, Sean ``Puff Daddy'' Combs. ``And unless
you completely Puff yourself out, it's going to be hard to be
appreciated.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The reality is Jermaine's work all across the board has been
exceptional,'' he continues. ``JD (Dupri's nickname) is just one of
these guys people feel. His ability to spot talent and make things
happen going all the way back to Kris Kross is just awesome. And
he's really done a solid thing with So So Def, the company.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of which, Dupri's now passing by the Day-Glo So So Def
billboard he's renting along I-85. If you're headed downtown from
the airport it's the one on the right with the guy with the big
Afro. As if you could miss it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I put that up there so people know Atlanta is the home of So
So Def Records,'' explains Dupri, using almost the exact words on
the billboard.
</P>
<P>
   ``You got a name for this story yet?'' he asks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the headline should read, `the heartbeat of Atlanta'.
That's what I'm starting to tell people. That's my new slogan.
Because I keep Atlanta's name in my music and I keep this city on
people's minds musically.''
</P>
<P>
   These days that's pretty hard to contest. While his peer,
Atlantan Dallas Austin co-produced the current No. 1pop and R&AMP;B
Brandy/Monica hit ``The Boy Is Mine,'' Austin's focus on his
now-defunct Freeworld Records has turned the volume down on the
Grammy nominee's career. Grammy-nominated producers Organized
Noize, also Atlantans, had a lot of momentum after TLC's
``Waterfalls,'' En Vogue's ``Don't Let Go (Love)'' and the Outkast
and Goodie Mob projects. But judging by Goodie Mob's current chart
status _ the gold-selling album they produced is at No. 37 on the
R&AMP;B album chart _ they seem to be sputtering.
</P>
<P>
   Dupri, on the other hand, is responsible for the current single
by Aretha Franklin (``Here We Go Again''), No. 28 on the R&AMP;B
charts; the first single from Monica's new CD (``First Night'');
and the gold-selling, No. 13 R&AMP;B ballad by his own So So Def
quartet, Xscape (``The Arms of the One Who Loves You''). And that's
all in addition to his own CD, which should be on the charts this
week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jermaine's just coming with the hot records,'' pronounced R&AMP;B
teen vocalist Monica.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like the man can do no wrong,'' adds Usher, with whom
Dupri penned ``You Make Me Wanna,'' ``Nice and Slow'' and current
No. 3 pop release, ``My Way.''
</P>
<P>
   On MTV, sometime ``Jams'' host/radio personality Angie Martinez
introduces Dupri as ``the mayor of Atlanta.''
</P>
<P>
   And Dupri is treated like it when he reaches Buckhead restaurant
Pricci. It's prime waiting list time but he is greeted by four of
the employees _ all standing at the host table as if about to be a
part of a military inspection _ and is escorted to a table with a
view of nearly the entire room.
</P>
<P>
   After two Shirley Temples and a salmon filet he flattens into
his mashed potatoes with his fork, he's ready to stomach, and deal
with, some of the less flattering comments made about his work.
First, the most popular barb: ``Jermaine Dupri is just trying to be
like Puffy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people just want to see me and Puffy have a problem. They
just want to start something. And that's real stupid to me because
we're the people that's providing the music. Why do they want
something to happen to both of us so that stops?
</P>
<P>
   But to answer the question ...
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah I admire all that Puffy's done. And yeah when I saw him
go out front and do his thing last year _ big _ I thought this
might be the time. But I check out what everybody in the game is
doing. I take all of that in, and I do my music my way.''
</P>
<P>
   And according to Dupri and his family, he had the opportunity to
move center stage long before Combs came out with his first single
``Can't Nobody Hold Me Down.'' Hip-hop legend has it that when
Dupri's father put the then-10-year-old on stage to dance during a
Diana Ross concert, the star was born.
</P>
<P>
   But as his father recalls, 1985 was the year he could have
started as a rapper. ``During the Fresh Festival in '84 he was like
the opening act, a mascot,'' said Michael Mauldin, who let his only
son tour with him while he worked as an artist manager. ``And I
allowed him the freedom to kind of socialize a bit. A little bit.
Because he was only 12.''
</P>
<P>
   Before he turned 13 Dupri had written a song with MC Shy-D,
called ``It's Me.'' ``I got the track finished for him, and I think
when the Fresh Festival was in Cleveland, he performed it. He had a
whole little routine for that one song. With a wardrobe change _
well he changed his jacket _ and everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Talks started then about signing Dupri to a deal, claims
Mauldin, now president of black music at Columbia Records (Maxwell,
The Fugees). ``But they just couldn't get a deal to me that made
sense. So right or wrong I just decided against it.
</P>
<P>
   Mauldin pauses, as if he still wonders if he could have chosen
an even better career path for his son.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know,'' he finally concludes, ``with the career this kid
has had I think we made the right choice. He's finally gonna be out
there doing it.''
</P>
<P>
   And doing it only once, Dupri claims. Headed south now back
towards the house, Dupri insists this turn as an artist will simply
be completing a circle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've done everything,'' the 25-year-old says.'' ``I was a
dancer first. I became a successful producer and have remained a
successful producer. So I guess that completes that entertainment
circle and I'll just go back to producing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no energy to be an artist, and after `Life In 1472',
the album and the movie do what they're going to do, I won't be
doing this artist thing again,'' repeats Dupri. ``I wanted to be an
artist like years ago. But then I fell in love with producing and
creating other artists. Telling them what to do and watching it
work. Kris Kross was an image made from my mind. (So So Def rapper
Da) Brat is an image of me in a girl's body. If I was a girl I
would have acted like Brat. And Usher is more like me if I was an
R&AMP;B artist.''
</P>
<P>
   And who is Jermaine Dupri as Jermaine Dupri?
</P>
<P>
   Well, after a while with him, you get the feeling the
5-foot-2-inch man thrives off this underdog vibe he emits. The ``I
ain't really big yet'' talk. ``People foil me.'' It keeps him
hungry for the next hit.
</P>
<P>
   An example: As he parks the BMW behind the same model he bought
for mom for Mother's Day, he won't get out of the car. His ear is
turned so close to the radio you would think it was about to play a
Jermaine Dupri- produced song for the very first time.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, V-103 FM evening personality Greg Street is just
counting down his nightly ``Top Eight at 8.'' And during the ride
back, Dupri has been counting aloud how many songs he has on it.
Three so far. And it's down to the top position ...
</P>
<P>
   ``And the number one jam on the `Top Eight at 8' is ... `It's
All Good' by the Mo Thugs Family.''
</P>
<P>
   Nope, that wasn't produced by Dupri. Foiled again.
</P>
<P>
   Guess ``Life in 1472'' doesn't always mean you're number one.
``I'm just a little ghetto producer in College Park,'' Dupri laughs
as he heads towards his home studio.
</P>
<P>
   Sure. Now which of your eight luxury automobiles are you taking
to that Vibe party downtown this evening?

 &HT;    Slide into snakeskin for a richly textured look this summer
 &HT;    (EMBARGOED UNTIL JULY 26: DO NOT USE BEFORE THEN)
 &HT;    BY A. SCOTT WALTON / c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Whether it's real or faux, printed or embossed, a little bit of
snakeskin can go a long way toward giving your summer wardrobe new
bite. But the array of snakeskin styles available is wide enough to
rattle even the savviest shopper.
</P>
<P>
   If you like the look of snakeskin but don't know what style to
choose, be afraid. Be very afraid. The smart way to select clothes
with snakeskin motifs is to approach them with caution.
</P>
<P>
   Start with something small and relatively harmless; snakeskin
belts, wallets and eyeglass cases, for instance, make charming
accessories.
</P>
<P>
   Next, take on something a bit bigger and more daring, such as a
handbag or pair of shoes.
</P>
<P>
   Karen Swope, the Atlanta-based general manager for Ticketmaster
Southeast, says she consistently gets favorable comments on her
strappy snakeskin sandals by Kenneth Cole.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like them because they're so fun and playful,'' Swope, 39,
says.
</P>
<P>
   She wears the sandals with a black-and-yellow floral dress by
Betsey Johnson or with a business suit and coordinating jewelry.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll wear them forever because they look so timeless,'' she
says.
</P>
<P>
   The time may come when you're tempted to wear more than
snakeskin accessories. If you simply can't resist serpentine suits
or separates, keep in mind that they must be worn with care.
</P>
<P>
   Snakeskin patterns don't mix or match easily. A safe way to go
is to pair a patterned piece with a solid.

 &HT;    Derivative teen flick promises scares, depth but never delivers
 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   It happens whenever something makes money: The hot new product
is followed by a flood of cheap knockoffs. Think Cabbage Patch
dolls and Tamagotchis.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, the goods are made of celluloid. ``Scream''
started it, resurrecting the teen horror flick. The same thing
happened 20 years ago, when ``Halloween'' scared the pants off the
Clearasil set. But by the mid-1980s, that movie's own bad sequels
and the endless tawdry encores from Freddy Krueger and Jason sealed
the genre back inside its crypt.
</P>
<P>
   Now, because the sharp ``Scream'' and ``Scream 2'' _ plus the
mediocre ``I Know What You Did Last Summer'' _ raked in bucks, here
comes an onslaught of teenagers-in-peril movies ... with
ever-diminishing returns.
</P>
<P>
   Exhibit A: ``Disturbing Behavior,'' a high-concept pitch with
zero follow-through. It's ``The Stepford Teens,'' with a touch of
``Invasion of the Body Snatchers,'' ``Heathers'' and ``A Clockwork
Orange.'' It's supposed to be scary and funny, but isn't either
one, and it doesn't have a single original moment.
</P>
<P>
   For the record, James Marsden plays Steve, a newcomer to
small-town Cradle Bay. At his high school, he encounters a
letter-jacketed band of frighteningly clean-cut teens who call
themselves the Blue Ribbons. They hang out at the yogurt shop like
a band of fascist Archies and, with the help of the school
psychiatrist (Bruce Greenwood), ``recruit'' a new classmate into
their group every few days.
</P>
<P>
   There's a satire trying to get out here. ``Behavior'' wants to
celebrate the pierced, tattooed slackers who reject things like
academic achievement and showers. But the movie is too busy
offering fake scares and generic teen-clique jokes to give its
premise any spin.
</P>
<P>
   At least the movie has some of the polish of ``The X-Files,''
thanks to series composer Mark Snow and director David Nutter. And
Vancouver, British Columbia, contributes its familiar drizzly, dank
menace. But there's nothing inside this slick package.
</P>
<P>
   ``Disturbing Behavior''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: C-
</P>
<P>
   Starring James Marsden and Katie Holmes. Directed by David
Nutter. Rated R for profanity, violence and simulated fellatio. 1
hour, 23 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: Disturbingly lame.

 &HT;    A temp's-eye view of corporate culture
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Kafka may be long dead, but the Kafkaesque corporate hell he
conjured up so expertly is still with us. Thus, ``Clockwatchers,''
a kind of Gen-X ``9 to 5'' that applies a subversive wit and a
funky slacker mentality to that organized abuse commonly known as
the workplace.
</P>
<P>
   Our focus is on four young women who work as temps at Global
Credit. They strive mightily to keep their sense of themselves (and
their sense of humor) intact as toxic Muzak pours through the
dehumanizing maze of sterile cubicles.
</P>
<P>
   Iris (Toni Collette from ``Muriel's Wedding'') is the new girl
and our narrator. She's befriended by the three other temps, whose
lowly status makes them veritable lepers in the eyes of the
full-time employees.
</P>
<P>
   Paula (Lisa Kudrow) is a leggy blonde with acting aspirations
that seem more talked about than acted upon. Jane (Alanna Ubach) is
the least worried about her career. She has an out, the culturally
sanctioned escape route known as a fiance and a wedding date. Their
ringleader is Margaret (Parker Posey), who keeps herself from going
ballistic by committing random acts of rebellion and minor
sabotage.
</P>
<P>
   This girl gang of four bond over happy-hour chicken wings and
shared grievances. Their unity is reinforced when a new young woman
is hired. She's full-time and permanent, and therefore a common
enemy.
</P>
<P>
   Writer-director Jill Sprecher has made a small-scale, wickedly
savvy film that should appeal to anyone who's ever felt a wave of
nausea when summoned to the obligatory employee of the month
awards. She knows the territory well, from the long hours with
nothing to do but look busy (at one point, Kudrow paints her
fingernails with white-out) to the small-minded middle managers who
so obligingly adopt a kiss-up/kick-down attitude.
</P>
<P>
   Sprecher also knows that life doesn't usually imitate the
movies. When one character is unfairly given the boot _ ``You can't
fire me; you don't even know my name!'' she protests _ no one pulls
a ``Spartacus'' on her behalf.
</P>
<P>
   The picture gets somewhat sidetracked by a who's-the-culprit
plot about petty thefts; it's far better when it sticks to the
subtle nuances of the typical dysfunctional corporate family.
Still, its insights are often priceless and its cast dead-on.
</P>
<P>
   Especially Posey, who embodies every overqualified employee ever
stuck in a moronic job and forced to smile at doubly moronic
supervisors. She turns high-strung self-awareness into an art form.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clockwatchers''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B+
</P>
<P>
   Starring Parker Posey, Lisa Kudrow and Toni Collette. Directed
by Jill Sprecher. Rated PG-13 for language. 1 hour, 36 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: A wicked take on workplace hell.

 &HT;    Director's comedic gift shines in `Jealousy'
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   As he proved in his debut feature, ``Kicking and Screaming,''
Noah Baumbach is a filmmaker with an ear for funny dialogue and an
eye for tender hearts. His sophomore effort, ``Mr. Jealousy,'' is a
Manhattan-set comedy of insecurity in which love sometimes finds a
way and sometimes doesn't.
</P>
<P>
   The characters are semi-neurotic romantics, less like people out
of a Woody Allen film than people who grew up watching Woody Allen
films. Lester (Eric Stoltz) is a would-be writer with a humongous
jealous streak he recognizes but can't control. His new love,
Ramona (Annabella Sciorra), is a vivacious art historian, working
her way through school by conducting tours at the Brooklyn Museum.
She's also someone with a jam-packed romantic past; by Lester's
count, she's had 26 lovers before him.
</P>
<P>
   His jealous nature gets the better of him. Discovering that one
of her exes is Dashiell Frank (Chris Eigeman), a writer who's been
dubbed ``the voice of his generation,'' Lester weasels his way into
Dashiell's therapy group. Complications ranging from mistaken
identity to mixed-up lovers ensue.
</P>
<P>
   The picture's major failing is that the complications don't
enrich either Baumbach's characters or his themes. The escalating
deceptions move toward the brittleness of farce rather than the
emotional satisfaction of romantic comedy. But the well-written
characters provide some balance, as do a number of well-sketched
(and well-played) smaller roles: Bridget Fonda as Eigeman's
stuttering girlfriend, director Peter Bogdanovich as the group's
therapist, Marianne Jean-Baptiste (``Secrets &AMP; Lies'') as someone's
fiancee.
</P>
<P>
   Further, the film is brimming with the sort of witty references
that don't call attention to themselves in that
aren't-we-smart-New-Yorkers way.
</P>
<P>
   Think of ``Mr. Jealousy'' as the sort of accomplished, pleasant
diversion that makes you look forward to whatever Baumbach does
next.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Jealousy''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   Starring Eric Stoltz and Annabella Sciorra. Directed by Noah
Baumbach. Rated R for language. At Tara. 1 hour, 45 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: A small-scale, smart-talking charmer.

 &HT;    `Saving Private Ryan' stunningly combines the glory and horror,
the heroism and madness of war
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hell doesn't begin to describe the war that Steven Spielberg
shows us in his superb new film, ``Saving Private Ryan.'' Nor do
the conventional words usually attached to war movies apply. The
director has reinvented the World War II film and imbued it with
the hallucinatory horrors typically associated with Vietnam movies,
while hewing strongly to the traditional soldier-on courage and
common-man decency we've long associated with ``the last good
war.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Saving Private Ryan'' can in no way be called a pro-war movie;
it's too crammed with blood 'n' guts reality for that. At the same
time, it's not precisely anti-war, either. Spielberg never condemns
nor condescends to the soldiers who fought. Rather, he comes to
praise them and, of necessity, to bury them, with honors. And
sadness.
</P>
<P>
   The movie begins where most movies would end, with a stunning,
hold-onto-your-hats, cover-your-eyes re-creation of the Allied
invasion of Normandy on D-Day. It is, perhaps, the most powerful
combat sequence ever put on film _ a plunge into the inferno as
Spielberg and his cinematographer, Janusz Kaminski, inundate us
with the blood, terror and sheer chaos of the assault. Intestines
ooze and the sea turns red with blood.
</P>
<P>
   Death isn't just horrifying here; it's horrifyingly random.
There's no reason why one man makes it and another doesn't. That
randomness _ that death is neither proud nor picky _ remains with
us throughout the picture.
</P>
<P>
   After the D-Day landing, Spielberg introduces his plot proper.
Among the survivors are Capt. John Miller (Tom Hanks) and his men.
In a nice bow to tradition, the squad comprises what critic Pauline
Kael once called ``a '40s-movie bomber-crew cast'': the
wisecracking, cynical New Yorker (Edward Burns); the hunky,
kind-hearted Italian-American (Vin Diesel); the rock-solid sergeant
(Tom Sizemore); the I-know-what-you're-doing-to-my-relatives Jew
(Adam Goldberg); the calm, conscientious medic (Giovanni Ribisi);
the seemingly fearless Bible Belt sharpshooter (Barry Pepper); and
the new addition, a translator (Jeremy Davies) who's never been in
combat before.
</P>
<P>
   Their assignment is to bring back alive a paratrooper, one Pvt.
James Ryan (Matt Damon). His three brothers have been killed in
action, and that multiple tragedy, according to top brass, has
earned him a ticket home. But his rescuers wonder, and grumble
about, whether he'll still be alive when they find him. And, if so,
why is his life worth risking all of theirs?
</P>
<P>
   Still, as Tennyson wrote, ``Theirs is not to reason why.'' So
they trudge onward. As they do, their various encounters,
adventures and skirmishes strangely recall ``Apocalypse Now'' _
different objectives, different wars, different directors,
different audiences. Yet the goal remains the same: Accomplish the
mission.
</P>
<P>
   At some point in their journey, ``Saving Private Ryan'' also
becomes a movie about saving Capt. Miller. Or, maybe, what's left
of Capt. Miller. Hanks' incandescent performance, a masterwork of
subtle emotionality, lays it right on the line. If this decent man,
who's a natural leader yet can't keep his hand from shaking,
manages to make it home, just who is coming home? Can he, after
this life-altering experience, ever be the person he was before he
was cast into this charnel house?
</P>
<P>
   Spielberg's one misstep is a present-day prologue and epilogue
in which a veteran visits a military grave. It's a neat bit of
diversionary-tactic filmmaking, but, heartfelt as they are, the
bookended scenes don't have the appalling poetry of what happens in
between.
</P>
<P>
   Still, that's a very minor quibble. ``Saving Private Ryan'' weds
the action-savvy Spielberg of ``Jaws'' to the ethical, reflective
Spielberg of ``Schindler's List.'' After seeing this movie, you'll
know not only how we won the war, but how we fought it _ one day,
one life, one incalculable act of heroism at a time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Saving Private Ryan''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: A
</P>
<P>
   Starring Tom Hanks, Directed by Steven Spielberg. Rated R for
extreme violence and some vulgar language. At metro theaters. 2
hours, 50 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: Part gung-ho heroism, part in-your-face horror
show, Spielberg's masterful film is World War II as you've never
seen it before.

 &HT;    COLUMN: All bridesmaids can do is wish couple the best
 &HT;    By Celestine Sibley
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   A woman who is having a bridesmaid luncheon for 25 at some spot
in Michigan called the other day to ask me if I knew the history of
bridesmaid luncheons and if I could give her some other interesting
details to enliven the occasion. I couldn't.
</P>
<P>
   I was a bridesmaid once, but there was no luncheon. Our police
reporter on The Mobile(Ala.) Press and the assistant society editor
had been visibly in love for some time, and late one day they
decided to get married. ``Come go with us,'' they said to me. ``You
can be maid of honor.''
</P>
<P>
   I went happily _ until the bride looked at my wrinkled voile
dress and said, ``I should have given you time to change clothes.''
</P>
<P>
   The truth was that I didn't have anything special to change to.
The voile, wrinkled or not, was as good as I had. But they had a
wonderful marriage, which ended in death for both of them only a
few years ago. I used to baby-sit their first child, and later on a
trip through Chicago on the way to the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota, I
met their second daughter, a beautiful girl.
</P>
<P>
   In time, I lost touch with my friend, the ex-society writer, but
the police reporter went into advertising, grew prosperous with his
own agency and, better still, helped launch Alcoholics Anonymous
throughout the country. He'd come to Atlanta on AA business and
always visit us. He told me about his experience with AA. Reared a
Catholic, he had departed the church, if not the faith, and become
a pretty bad drunk.
</P>
<P>
   His alcoholism cost him his agency and friends, but not his good
wife. She stood by and when he hit bottom, she was there to help
pick him up. He told me in graphic detail of that moment. He had
been drunk for days, he said, and had ended up in a vacant,
dilapidated building on Chicago's Skid Row. He was huddled on the
floor, freezing and vomiting, he said, and he finally did what he
had eschewed since childhood. He prayed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `God help me,''' he told me.
</P>
<P>
   I guess he dozed off or lapsed into unconsciousness, because
when he came to, his wife and an AA friend were with him and had
begun to get him out of the dump. He began going to AA meetings,
and before long he was an inspiration and a help to other drunks.
When he would come to Atlanta, he had returned to being a handsome,
well-dressed man with a prosperous business to back him up, and he
was still proud of his daughters and in love with his wife.
</P>
<P>
   The last time I saw him, he had visited us on 13th Street and
called a cab to take him back to his hotel _ the old Winecoff, I
think. I went out to the curb, and he hugged me and said,
``Goodbye, bridesmaid. You did a wonderful job.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, I had nothing to do with it, except that I loved them
both and was happy in their happiness. That may be the historic
role of bridesmaids. I didn't think to say that to my caller about
the Michigan luncheon.
</P>
<P>
   When my front room tenant, Ann Wood, married Martin Waldron
(both were of our staff, but later of other newspapers, including
The New York Times), I went to Ann's home in Birmingham to lend a
hand _ I thought. Her mother had been ill, but about all I could do
was meet people at the airport and pick up the cake. Ann had a
luncheon for her bridesmaids (I wasn't there), but they hadn't
worked out their attire.
</P>
<P>
   I can hear her wailing, ``What are we going to do with the
bridesmaids' heads?''
</P>
<P>
   None of our suggestions _ hats, veils, flowers _ worked. Finally
Martin, wearying of the subject, said, ``May I suggest that you
serve them on trays?''
</P>
<P>
   We all had an unfortunate picture of pretty girls walking into
church with their heads on trays like Salome with John the
Baptist's. It ended the debate.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps they are wise who never, never ask my advice on social
matters.

 &HT;    The best years of their lives
 &HT;    By Marques G. Harper
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Their eyes don't reveal any last-minute jitters or secrets.
</P>
<P>
   The meaning of love and marriage is simply told in the way they
hold each other's hands, standing in front of the rabbi.
</P>
<P>
   Esther Margol, who is 70, wears a white, two-piece outfit, no
veil, and carries a bouquet of deep pink roses. Her groom, Howard,
74, wears a simple black tuxedo.
</P>
<P>
   On their 50th wedding anniversary, they've gathered original
bridesmaids and groomsmen, friends and family to renew their vows
and celebrate their marriage.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would like it to last a long time, but who's kidding
whom?'' Mrs. Margol says about the next 50 years of marriage. It's
the golden age of the golden anniversary, thanks to couples who,
like the Margols, got hitched soon after World War II. More than
6.1 million couples married from 1946 to 1948, paving the way for
the baby boom. In 1948, 1.8 million marriages took place, a number
that would not be matched again until 1966. With Americans living
longer, more couples are notching a half-century of togetherness.
Hallmark Cards took notice of World War II-era weddings in 1991
with a card for its anniversary lineup. The company expected to
sell more than 100,000 of the cards in 1996, a peak year for golden
anniversaries. (Nearly 2.3 million couples married in 1946.)
Instead, it sold 350,000. The newest addition to the lineup is a
card for couples who married just after the war.
</P>
<P>
   ``By the time you live together for 50 years, you become bonded
in such a way,'' says Jackie Boles, a sociology professor at
Georgia State University. ``That is something in this day and time
to celebrate.''
</P>
<P>
   Compared with 10 years ago, more people are acknowledging their
50th anniversary by throwing parties, says Patrick Cuccaro,
president of Off-Premises Caterers Coalition, a group of metro
Atlanta caterers.
</P>
<P>
   And members of the most affluent over-65 generation ever are
more likely to shell out for golden anniversary celebrations, says
Brad Edmondson, former editor of American Demographics magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Celebrations can be as casual as a buffet, Martha Stewart
advises in her magazine, as romantic as a weekend getaway or as
elaborate as the Margols' black-tie affair at the Academy of
Medicine in Midtown. Church receptions, family get-togethers _ even
parties where guests are asked to dress in their military uniforms
from World War II _ are other ways that couples mark the occasion.
``People are going back to the church for the wedding and the
50-year receptions,'' says Windsor Jordan, owner of Mary Jordan
Caterers. ``They are getting back to the honor of being together
for 50 years.''
</P>
<P>
   When selecting a party theme, consider pegging it to favorite
movies or events from the time period, suggests Barbara Roos, owner
of Event Design Group, an Atlanta party planner. ``We try to do a
walk through 50 years,'' she says. Bobbie and B.B. Wingo of
Hampton, who celebrated their golden anniversary this year, did so
amid magazines from 1948, wedding pictures and photos of their
children and grandchildren over the years.
</P>
<P>
   About 180 people attended the Wingos' celebration, including
friends, the best man and maid of honor at their wedding and
several members of McDonough Presbyterian Church, where the
reception was held.
</P>
<P>
   Roselyn Clay, one of the Wingos' daughters, says her mother
began thinking about the bash soon after celebrating her 45th
anniversary. Clay and her sisters started planning their parents'
golden anniversary about a year ago. In early 1997, Clay, 49, and
her sisters also started making a quilt to give to their parents as
an anniversary gift. Each square represents their family's history.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we got married, it was very small. It was at my home.
That's why I think the girls wanted this one to be a big affair,''
says Mrs. Wingo, 69. Frank Thomas, an Atlanta lawyer, wasn't sure
how his parents, Frank and Joyce, wanted to celebrate their 50th
anniversary this year. He offered them a cruise or a trip to the
West Virginia resort where they honeymooned in 1948.
</P>
<P>
   They preferred an evening with friends, so Thomas, 47, and his
siblings threw an outdoor dinner for 98 people at his Buckhead
townhouse this year. ``I think anyone who makes it 50 years
deserves a medal,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Before the ceremony at her party, Mrs. Margol, an energetic
mother of four and grandmother of seven, read from her husband's
old love letters and reminisced about the blind date that started
their relationship.
</P>
<P>
   ``No e-mail in those days,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Then she switched to the final act of her show, introducing her
husband and their cast of bridesmaids and groomsmen. After renewing
their vows, the Margols kissed to seal their promise to love, honor
and cherish each other.
</P>
<P>
   As the Margols took the first dance to their favorite song,
``Moon River,'' niece Judy Landey gazed at the couple and said,
``It's like history repeats itself.''
</P>
<P>
   For Mr. Margol, the anniversary had a slightly different
meaning: ``We're celebrating the fact that we're still alive.''

 &HT;    Party ideas
 &HT;    By Marques G. Harper
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Here are some suggestions for planning a 50th-anniversary party:
</P>
<P>
   -- A year is not too far in advance to start planning,
especially if you want to book an art museum or hotel ballroom.
</P>
<P>
   -- Consider the couple's personalities when deciding what type
of party to give. Unless it's a surprise party, consult them early
in the planning.
</P>
<P>
   -- Use old photos and font styles to create an invitation that
will set the tone of the party.
</P>
<P>
   -- If you're throwing a party with siblings, agree in advance on
a budget and how you're going to split the costs of the affair.
</P>
<P>
   -- For a nostalgic touch, ask guests to give speeches about the
couple. Create a scrapbook by asking friends and family to send in
letters, photos or memories before the party.
</P>
<P>
   -- Use photographs from the past 50 years as decorations.

 &HT;    Learning to sing in `more than one voice': Tour adds Queen
Latifah's hip-hop to mix
 &HT;    By Sonia Murray
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- First Lilith Fair had to prove that an all-female
bill could attract audiences. What kind of music the women sang was
almost secondary. And who bought tickets didn't matter as much as
that tickets got bought.
</P>
<P>
   So last year's inaugural tour came and went, and so did the
record-breaking audiences. Mission accomplished. The first mission,
that is. Now there's the matter of moving past the novelty; Lilith
was a pretty homogeneous event the first time around.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just about everybody was along the pop-folk vein,'' says
jazz-based vocalist Holly Cole, who is on this year's bill. ``And _
how do I put this? _ a lot of the people who came looked a lot like
the people onstage.''
</P>
<P>
   The last thing Lilith founder Sarah McLachlan needed to do was
``help do the stereotyping the world has done a pretty good job of
already,'' Cole adds. ``Women have more than one voice, do more
than one kind of music.''
</P>
<P>
   And come in more than one color.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, Lilith is acknowledging the blackness this year,'' says
rapper and actress Queen Latifah. In 1997, folk's Tracy Chapman and
jazz's Cassandra Wilson were part of the rotating lineup, but
neither are mainstream black artists.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hip-hop is still very much in that early rock 'n' roll state
of mind,'' says Latifah, 28. ``You think `hip-hop' and the general
public automatically thinks `male.' A hard-core,
grabbing-his-(genitals), not-smiling man who will only let a woman
on his side if she acts just like him. And I mean, I won't even get
into the misogyny and whatever people who don't listen to a lot of
rap think it's all about. To put it simply, the image of hip-hop is
`hard,' so that almost automatically doesn't say `woman.'''
</P>
<P>
   But it was within hip-hop culture that the Newark, N.J., native
grew up. And, female or not, ``when I felt this was what I wanted
to do, I was going for mine,'' says Latifah, who has just released
her fourth album, ``Order in the Court.'' ``It's been rough. You
know, first going out there into this male-dominated, male-minded
music and telling the women to stand upright and hold their own.
Then I started Flavor Unit (a management company) and there were
doubters. (I) went into acting, doubts. But you know, a lot of
women with ambition to do whatever face the same thing. The only
difference, I think, is that I started out in a business, in a kind
of music, in which many wrongly think it's almost mandatory to hate
women.''
</P>
<P>
   With Rebekah, a 25-year-old Cleveland native, her sex hasn't
been the issue; it's her race. ``Obviously I'm black, and when you
listen to my music, it becomes quite obvious that it's not music
typically done by black females,'' says the singer, whose debut is
titled ``Remember to Breathe.'' ``But people can't proceed from
there. Sometimes radio and retailers don't quite know what they
should do with me. They're like, `She doesn't sound like Brandy.'
So they put my record in the rap section.
</P>
<P>
   ``So I've been fighting people and stereotypes and it's taking
time, but I'm patient. It's working. This black girl playing rock
music is really starting to sink in.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Rebekah's people and Cole's people can share marketing
plans, as Cole faces a similar difficulty. ``When your music is a
hybrid based in jazz that branches off into country, rock, R&AMP;B and
blues, you're just asking for trouble in this business,'' says
Cole, 33. ``Asking for it. You're just too hard to pigeonhole.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But business is not what I'm doing this for,'' continues the
vocalist, whose latest release is ``Dark Dear Heart.'' ``This is
not an artistic battle, it's a marketing battle. And frankly,
marketing is not my job.''
</P>
<P>
   Latifah, hip-hop's Missy (``The Rain'') and R&AMP;B's Erykah Badu
(``On &AMP; On''), all on the Lilith tour this year, do qualify as
mainstream black artists.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a good, smart start,'' says Village Voice cultural
critic Greg Tate. ``The question now is, Will Erykah and Missy's
fans come out to a show that is still mostly not what they hear on
the radio? I don't think so. I think Lilith will still be
entertaining the same audience with a broader bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is that progress?'' Tate asks rhetorically. ``But, oh well,
effort duly noted.''

 &HT;    Venus rising: Lilith acts find success
 &HT;    By Miriam Longino
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- Like its ethereal logo of Venus rising, the Lilith
Fair music festival has blossomed into much more than a celebration
of women. In its second year, Sarah McLachlan's all-female road
show, which pulls into the Lakewood Amphitheatre today, has taken
on mythic proportions as one of the most significant events in the
history of pop music.
</P>
<P>
   An overblown assessment? Maybe not.
</P>
<P>
   Women have always had a presence in rock, pop and rhythm and
blues, from the sweet soul sounds of the Supremes to Janis Joplin's
sandpaper screams to Madonna's crotch-grabbing. But they have never
dominated music charts or generated the tour revenues of their male
counterparts. No matter how popular she got, Stevie Nicks could
never catch up with Elton John.
</P>
<P>
   ``When programming music, we were always told that it wasn't
good to play two females back to back,'' says Leslie Fram, program
director of Atlanta new-rock station WNNX-FM. ``They thought it
would be confusing, that all female voices blended together. But
how could that possibly be more confusing than two male artists
played back to back? But I can tell you that the average radio
listener can tell the difference between Sheryl Crow and Sarah
McLachlan.''
</P>
<P>
   For years, tour promoters (mostly male) considered most female
artists the ``chick opening act,'' and few women could fill concert
arenas as headliners. That, in turn, often meant they weren't able
to tap into the big money or exercise significant control over
their own careers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every single day was a fight,'' recalls 1980s pixie rocker Pat
Benatar. ``Only one woman was allowed, so there was so much
competition and no camaraderie among women artists whatsoever. We
were the first daughters of the women of the women's movement, and,
for us, everything was a struggle.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1996 things changed. For the first time, female artists had
more hits on the Top 20 music charts than men. It was the year of
the Strong Solo Woman: Toni Braxton, Mariah Carey, Celine Dion,
Alanis Morissette, Wynonna and Shania Twain. The next year, against
opposition from tour promoters, McLachlan launched Lilith Fair,
which surprised the music world by becoming the
second-highest-grossing concert tour of 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is happening with women and Lilith Fair is every bit as
revolutionary as when Elvis went into the Sun Records studio with
Scotty (Moore) and Bill (Black),'' says James Dickerson, a music
journalist and author of the new book ``Women on Top: The Quiet
Revolution That Is Rocking the American Music Industry.'' ``What we
are seeing are the fruits of the women's movement. Sarah and the
women in Lilith Fair are saying things that are speaking to women
and men. I haven't seen a sense of fellowship like this since the
'60s, when 95 percent of the artists felt the same sense of
fellowship around a cause'' _ the Vietnam War.
</P>
<P>
   A look at McLachlan's own history bears this out. The
30-year-old singer-songwriter was raised in Canada by U.S.
expatriates who were dodging the war. She exudes a modern blend of
strength, confidence and sensuality _ not as severe as the
hard-core feminists of the past (Joan Baez, Joan Jett), and not as
kittenish as pop's playthings (Paula Abdul, the Go-Gos). As with
Carole King or Carly Simon, the themes of her songs are universal,
more introspective than angry. Admittedly, the majority of those in
the Lilith Fair audience are females in bluejeans _ mothers,
daughters, sisters, girlfriends. Last year's crowd was estimated to
be about 70 percent female.
</P>
<P>
   The rise of the female pop artist, however, can be attributed to
more than consciousness raising. According to Dickerson, two
pivotal events _ one legal, one logistical _ helped break down
barriers and pave the way for Lilith Fair.
</P>
<P>
   From the birth of modern rock in the 1950s through the 1980s,
the music business was notorious for its bottom-pinching
behind-the-scenes treatment of women. Like female recording
artists, women who worked at record companies were often considered
ornaments for the taking. Few ``girls'' made it past the
receptionist's chair, and most who did climb the ladder still had
to endure the often grossly sexist expectations of the male
executives around them.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in 1991, a secretary named Penny Muck filed a sexual
harassment lawsuit against Geffen Records, home of
testosterone-rock acts such as Guns N' Roses and Aerosmith. She
claimed that her boss, a high-ranking manager, had masturbated in
front of her and fondled her breasts. After other female employees
came forward, she was awarded about half a million dollars in an
out-of-court settlement. Few music fans know Muck's name, but her
lawsuit brought national attention to the ``bad boy'' behavior of
many in the music industry and was a catalyst for change.
</P>
<P>
   The second crack in the system that led to Lilith Fair was a
change in the makeup of record and promotion companies. There now
are more women in executive, decision-making positions than ever
before. And they, in turn, are signing female acts and committing
promotional and marketing dollars to them. As a result, albums by
women are turning platinum.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't have sales like Sarah McLachlan's or Alanis
Morissette's without men buying your CDs too,'' Dickerson says.
``You can get into the Top 20, but to be that successful, you have
to have male buyers as well.''
</P>
<P>
   Lilith Fair grossed $16.4 million last summer, more than any
other concert tour except George Strait's country music festival.
McLachlan has said she is happy with the tour's success but also
aware that it took dollar signs to get attention.
</P>
<P>
   At the outset of this year's Lilith Fair tour, she told Newsday,
``It's unfortunate that the only reason the industry recognizes us
is that we have become a viable commercial commodity. I'm not naive
enough to think that it's changed men's attitudes. But I do like to
think that some education and awareness can take place. Every
little step forward is a step in a positive direction.''

 &HT;    Hormones rage on Riviera_ that's the point of `Marie'
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   How do you say ``Beach Blanket Bingo'' in French?
</P>
<P>
   OK, so Manuel Pradal's debut film, ``Marie Baie des Anges'' is
considerably hotter than anything Frankie Avalon and Annette
Funicello ever tried, but at heart, it's just as teen-temptingly
silly.
</P>
<P>
   The movie is set on a ravishingly beautiful slice of the French
Riviera, Nice's Bay of Angels, where, we're told, the angels in
question are actually angel sharks. It centers on sultry,
15-year-old Marie (Vahina Giocante) and Orso (Frederic Malgras), a
foxy, 17-year-old petty thief.
</P>
<P>
   For the first part of the film, he gets into trouble with the
authorities while she gets, well, friendly with some sex-starved
American sailors who apparently don't know (or care) what the
French word is for ``jailbait.'' Somehow, the two find each other
and embark on a ``Blue Lagoon''-ish idyll on a mostly deserted
island (one says ``mostly'' because, when the director so chooses,
there are bottles of wine or happily dancing tourists to complement
the romantic mood).
</P>
<P>
   Pradal gets one thing very right. Just about every scene is
charged with sex, danger or both as Marie works her nubile charms
on the Americans or on Orso's pals, a roving band of feral youths
riding motorbikes. Her power, fleeting as it is, is displayed with
immense assurance and Lolita-ish smolder by young Giocante.
</P>
<P>
   Still, gorgeous as she, Malgras and the Riviera are, the movie
never becomes anything more than a lot of pseudo-cool hooey,
intoxicated with its own studied eroticism. More often than not, it
comes off as an unintentional parody of all those ``hot'' art
flicks of the late 1950s and early '60s. Like its young leads,
``Marie Baie des Anges'' has lots of attitude and not a coherent
thought in its pretty head.
</P>
<P>
   ``Marie Baie des Anges''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: C
</P>
<P>
   Starring Vahina Giocante and Frederic Malgras. Directed by
Manuel Pradal. Subtitles. Rated R for nudity, brief violence and
sexually charged situations. 1 hour, 30 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: All hot and bothered in paradise, but not
especially coherent or thoughtful.

 &HT;    Few fresh faces appear among acting nominees
 &HT;    By Bob Longino
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Now he's saving the Emmys.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Hanks, whose critically hailed big-screen film ``Saving
Private Ryan'' opens today, racked up a leading 17 Emmy nominations
Thursday, including a nod for best director, for his stellar HBO
miniseries ``From the Earth to the Moon.''
</P>
<P>
   Hanks, a two-time Oscar winner, is the most powerful,
recognizable face to become a major Emmy player in years.
</P>
<P>
   As usual, most of this year's TV nominees are the same old
nominees we've been getting for much of the '90s: Anthony Edwards
on ``ER,'' Kelsey Grammer on ``Frasier,'' Julia Louis-Dreyfus on
``Seinfeld.'' Blah _ blah blah _ blah blah.
</P>
<P>
   Not that he isn't talented, but will you really relish wading
through a four-hour Emmy show Sept. 13 just to watch John Lithgow
be handed yet one more of TV's precious hood ornaments?
</P>
<P>
   Didn't think so.
</P>
<P>
   Much of this year's Emmy nominations list reads like a
less-than-new-to-you rerun: ``ER,'' ``Law &AMP; Order,'' ``The
X-Files,'' ``Tracey Takes On ...'' And who couldn't guess that
``Ally McBeal'' (10 nominations, including best sitcom and comedy
actress) would be so heavily honored?
</P>
<P>
   But besides Hanks, there are other interesting aspects to this
year's list of nominees:
</P>
<P>
   -- The best surprises: Camryn Manheim got a supporting nod for
her dynamite delivery as Ellenor Frutt on ABC's ``The Practice.''
And her show eked into the race for best drama against ``ER,''
``Law &AMP; Order,'' ``The X-Files'' and ``NYPD Blue.''
</P>
<P>
   -- The very deserving: Andre Braugher of ``Homicide: Life on the
Street'' and Jimmy Smits of ``NYPD Blue'' are both up for best
drama actor for their final seasons.
</P>
<P>
   -- Lest we forget them: Phil Hartman (``NewsRadio''), Lloyd
Bridges (a guest spot on ``Seinfeld'') and J.T. Walsh (TNT's
``Hope'') all got nominations.
</P>
<P>
   -- The overlooked: ``Seinfeld's'' Michael Richards was passed
over in a season when Cosmo Kramer was arguably the best thing
about the show.
</P>
<P>
   -- The small-screen stuff: TNT's ``George Wallace'' got eight
nominations as did HBO's ``Don King: Only in America.'' Gary
Sinise, who played Wallace, and Ving Rhames, who was King, both got
nods.
</P>
<P>
   -- Great performances: Emma Thompson was nominated for playing
herself in a guest spot on ``Ellen''; Jack Lemmon got a nod for
Showtime's ``12 Angry Men.''
</P>
<P>
   -- What were they thinking? Kirstie Alley is up for comedy
actress for ``Veronica's Closet.''
</P>
<P>
   -- Not that there's anything wrong with that: For its final
season, ``Seinfeld'' pulled in a meager five nominations. HBO's
``The Larry Sanders Show'' fared much better for its swan-song
year: it got 10, including well-deserved acting nods for Garry
Shandling, Rip Torn and Jeffrey Tambor. Besides ``Seinfeld'' and
``Sanders,'' the other sitcom nominees are ``McBeal,'' ``Frasier''
and ``3rd Rock From the Sun.''

 &HT;    Fiber, fiber everywhere_ and not a bite to eat
 &HT;    By Catherine Fox
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Fiber isn't just weaving anymore. It's sensuous contemporary
yardage. Unusual tapestries. Yarns, beads and buttons. Basketry.
Rag rugs. Sculptures. Quilts and fashion.
</P>
<P>
   The brave new world of fiber includes all these and other works
of art whose only connection to loomed pieces is the material out
of which they are made.
</P>
<P>
   This weekend, metro Atlanta is Fiber Central. The Handweavers
Guild of America brings its conference south for the first time,
and local galleries have responded with more fiber exhibitions than
you can shake a shuttlecock at.
</P>
<P>
   Both the international biennial conference, ``Convergence '98:
Rhythms &AMP; Hues,'' which began Thursday and continues through
Sunday, and these myriad shows revel in the long and varied
tradition of fiber art. There will be workshops devoted to making
Scottish tartans and Africans demonstrating the art of kente cloth.
Georgia's Mary Hambidge, who revived weaving traditions here, is
the subject of a show at the Atlanta History Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``For fiber, the last 30 and 40 years ... have been a period of
expansion,'' says Atlanta basketmaker Michael Davis. ``Everything
has been questioned. The basket came off the loom. Clothing is a
huge part of it. There's a lot more interesting work done now than
even 15 years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Convergence,'' which brings 2,000 fiber artists and fans to
town, creates an unusual opportunity for Atlanta. ``People will see
things they've never seen before, on a scale that they will never
see again,'' Davis says. ``It should be an inspiration to local
artists, too.''
</P>
<P>
   MUST-SEE FIBER
</P>
<P>
   Our list of recommended stops at Convergence '98, which
continues through Sunday at the Atlanta Market Center
(770-351-0233), and at Atlanta galleries:

FOX INCREASES ITS ANIMATION DRAW BY 3 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN LEVESQUE  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ With ``The Simpsons'' and ``King of the
Hill,'' Fox has proven there's an appetite out there for chewy,
well-done animated fare in prime time. But on the assumption that
our appetites are insatiable, the network early next year will lay
out a veritable animation smorgasbord, adding three more series,
including a new sci-fi entry from ``Simpsons'' creator Matt
Groening.
</P>
<P>
   If all five animated series are on the schedule at the same
time, they will comprise 25 percent of Fox's prime-time
programming.
</P>
<P>
   Groening's new effort is ``Futurama.'' He said the action takes
place a thousand years from now and features three main characters,
all with the familiar big eyeballs and overbites that Groening
ascribes to ``the tragedy of limited drawing skills.'' The main
character right now is a ``lovably corrupt'' robot named Bender,
possibly the first robot in science fiction that shoplifts.
</P>
<P>
   Joining ``Futurama'' on Fox's tentative midseason schedule are
``The PJs'' and ``Family Guy.'' ``The PJs'' is an Eddie Murphy
project about life in the projects _ the PJs _ with ``foamation''
by Portland's clay-animation pioneer, Will Vinton. The funniest of
the bunch may be ``Family Guy'' from Seth MacFarlane, a 24-year-old
animator with an odd view of the ``typical'' suburban family.
</P>
<P>
   The obvious appeal of ``The Simpsons'' and ``King of the Hill''
has other networks paying attention. This summer, The WB tested
``Invasion America,'' an animated drama from Steven Spielberg's
company, and NBC is working on an Americanized version of a British
animated comedy, ``Stressed Eric.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``Ally McBeal'' cast grows this fall with the addition of
Portia de Rossi, who plays attorney Nell Porter. De Rossi describes
Porter as ``a very strong character, a good lawyer who is
intelligent and makes her own way.''
</P>
<P>
   De Rossi, who studied law in Australia before pursuing an acting
career, said Richard Fish (Greg Germann) hires Porter as a
rainmaker, someone who can attract well-heeled clients to the firm.
As to how Porter interacts with Ally (Calista Flockhart), de Rossi
said, ``We'll just have to wait and see.''
</P>
<P>
   (BBOX)Scott Bairstow, who lives in Mukilteo when not working in
L.A., will join Fox's ``Party of Five'' this season as the
boyfriend of Julia Salinger's (Neve Campbell) college roommate.
Bairstow starred last season in the short-lived ``Significant
Others,'' which was produced by the same people who do ``Party of
Five.''
</P>
<P>
   Josie Bissett, another native of the Seattle area, rejoins
``Melrose Place'' this season after a self-imposed time away.
Though she visited the set occasionally to be with hubby Rob Estes,
she says she didn't watch ``Melrose'' on TV too often.
</P>
<P>
   ``I only watched it when Rob and Heather (Locklear) had love
scenes,'' she laughed. ``It turns me on. What can I say?''

U.S. DELEGATE TO INTERNATIONAL COURT PARLEY CRITICIZES TREATY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By NICOLE TSONG  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ David Scheffer, head of the U.S. delegation to a
U.N. conference that approved a new international war crimes court,
told the Senate Thursday that the United States voted against the
treaty because of the unlimited power of the new court.
</P>
<P>
   The treaty, which was approved in Rome on July 17 by 120
countries, establishes a court that would prosecute genocide, war
crimes and crimes against humanity and aggression.
</P>
<P>
   The court will officially convene after 60 countries ratify the
measure. A number of traditional U.S. allies, such as France, Great
Britain and Canada, signed the pact but the United States was among
seven nations opposing it. The other opponents included China, Iran
and Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Scheffer told the Senate subcommittee on international
operations that one of his major objections to the treaty is that
it gives the court power over countries that do not sign the pact.
</P>
<P>
   ``Under such a theory, two governments could join together to
create a criminal court and purport to extend its jurisdiction over
everyone, everywhere in the world,'' he testified.
</P>
<P>
   The United States unsuccessfully sought an amendment that would
require both nations to agree to the jurisdiction of the court.
Without the U.S. amendment, Scheffer said, U.S. armed forces
overseas could potentially be prosecuted by the court if they were
stationed in a country that signs the treaty.
</P>
<P>
   The United States, he said, believes that jurisdiction over
dissenting nations should be limited to the U.N. Security Council;
any prosecutions then would require the council's recommendations.
</P>
<P>
   The treaty also allows a prosecutor to investigate with the
consent of two of the court's 18 judges.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Rod Grams, R-Minn., chair of the subcommittee and foe of
the treaty, said this provision could create politically motivated
prosecutions.
</P>
<P>
   Grams said the treaty was a ``monster'' and predicted the U.S.
Senate would never ratify such a measure.
</P>
<P>
   The United States ``will not cede its sovereignty to an
institution which claims to have the power to override the U.S.
legal system and pass judgment on our foreign policy actions,''
Grams said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Should this court come into existence, we must have a firm
policy of total non-cooperation: no funding, no acceptance of its
jurisdiction, no acknowledgement of its rulings, and absolutely no
referral of cases by the Security Council,'' Grams said.
</P>
<P>
   Michael P. Scharf, a professor at the New England School of Law,
said the United States had a number of legitimate concerns, but
should have approved the treaty after U.S. representatives pushed
through many of their recommendations at the Rome meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``A future Adolf Hitler may point to the U.S. action in telling
his followers that they need not fear being held accountable,'' he
testified.
</P>
<P>
   The United States will also lose a voice in the development of
the court because they refused to approve the treaty, Scharf said.

MICROSOFT ATTACKED BY SEN. HATCH AND RIVAL COMPANIES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (EDs: FILED in ``w'' and ``f'' categories)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARK HELM  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Software giant Microsoft came under attack again
Thursday from a leading senator and from executives of rival
companies, who called the firm a monopoly that threatens innovation
in the computer industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``The critical debate, many believe, is the extent to which
Microsoft is exploiting its current monopolies both to kill off
potential threats, and to leverage these monopolies to control new
technologies which will define the future of computing, of the
Internet and of how we conduct much of our daily lives,'' said Sen.
Orrin Hatch, R-Utah.
</P>
<P>
   Hatch, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, which was
holding its second hearing into Microsoft's business practices,
said the Redmond, Wash., company ``certainly appeared to have
engaged in anti-competitive behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   At a previous hearing in March, billionaire Microsoft Chairman
Bill Gates defended his company's actions as those of an
``aggressive'' firm. However, at Wednesday's hearing, neither Gates
nor any other Microsoft official testified before the committee.
</P>
<P>
   Hatch said he had asked Microsoft officials to come to the
hearing, but they declined. He added that some other companies
asked to testify on Microsoft's behalf had turned down the offer.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact is that our doors have not exactly been knocked down
with companies asking to defend Microsoft's business practices,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft, which is fighting an antitrust lawsuit by the Justice
Department and 20 states, said it would be inappropriate to appear
since the trial in that case is scheduled for September.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not clear that additional testimony from Microsoft will
serve any purpose,'' the company said in a statement, which noted
Hatch's frequent attacks.
</P>
<P>
   However, outside the hearing room, Microsoft did receive support
from Sen. Slade Gordon, R-Wash., who held a press conference only
minutes before the hearing started.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is nothing but another show for unsuccessful competitors
to make their complaints against one of America's most successful
companies,'' he said, adding that the hearing was ``another chapter
in Sen. Hatch's vendetta against Microsoft.''
</P>
<P>
   But inside the hearing room, heads of rival companies painted a
totally different picture of Microsoft and Gates.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Glasser, chairman of Seattle-based RealNetworks, which
makes software that allows people to watch video across the
Internet, said Microsoft was attempting to undermine his product.
</P>
<P>
   Glasser, who worked for Microsoft for 10 years and said he was a
friend of Gates, charged that Microsoft's version of the video
software, known as Windows Media Player, blocks consumers from
using his product.
</P>
<P>
   To prove his point, Glasser entered a site on the World Wide Web
and played a news video, which used his software product. Glasser
then downloaded Windows Media Player and re-entered the same Web
site. The video failed to play.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft, in a statement released responding to Glasser's
testimony, said the company ``does NOT disable'' the RealNetworks'
product.
</P>
<P>
   After Glasser testified, Sen. Robert Torricelli, D-N.J., read an
affidavit from a Microsoft official that accused the RealNetworks
chief of seeking to use his appearance before the committee as
leverage to force Microsoft to make a deal with his company.
</P>
<P>
   In the affidavit, Paul Maritz, a Microsoft vice president, said
that on Wednesday Glass offered to withdraw as a witness if
Microsoft would accept a new licensing agreement with RealNetworks.
Its current licensing agreement with Microsoft expired Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   While acknowledging that he spoke with Microsoft officials on
Wednesday, Glasser said it was only to brief them on what he was
going to say at the hearing. He called the claim that he tried to
force them into a deal ``completely untrue.''
</P>
<P>
   Another Gates' rival, Lawrence J. Ellison, chairman of Oracle
Corp., based in Redwood Shores, Calif., told the committee that
Microsoft would never be satisfied with only part of the software
market.
</P>
<P>
   ``Microsoft is already the most powerful company in the world,
and you ain't seen nothing yet,'' said the Ellison, whose company
is the world's second-largest independent software company.
</P>
<P>
   He said Microsoft was using the dominance of its Window's
operating system _ the program is installed in 95 percent of new
computers _ to stifle competition and take over other software
markets.
</P>
<P>
   Ellison said Microsoft's response to the success of Netscape
Corp.'s Navigator, the Mountain View, Calif., company's Internet
browser, has been typical of what he called Microsoft's
``predatory'' business practices.
</P>
<P>
   He said that when Netscape Navigator emerged as a key portal to
the World Wide Web, Microsoft quickly copied the technology and
introduced its own browser, called Internet Explorer. Microsoft
then added, or ``bundled,'' Internet Explorer to the company's
Windows program. The result is that people who buy a new computer
with Windows already installed no longer need Netscape Navigator.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Microsoft's share of the Internet browser market has
increased steadily for the last year, and the company now has
nearly 50 percent of the market. Netscape Navigator's share of the
market has fallen from around 80 percent to less than 50 percent in
that time.
</P>
<P>

   Last month, a federal appeals court overturned a U.S. District
Court injunction that had prohibited Microsoft from requiring
computer manufacturers to install Microsoft's browser software for
navigating the World Wide Web as a condition of installing Windows
95.
</P>
<P>
   The appeals court said Microsoft had the right to add whatever
new features it wanted to its operating system, even if that
included ``bundling'' other products, as long as the result
benefits consumers.
</P>
<P>
   The appeals court's ruling came as blow to 20 state attorneys
general and Department of Justice officials, who have alleged in a
lawsuit that Microsoft is illegally tying its Windows 98 software
with its Internet Explorer browser.
</P>
<P>
   They argue that Microsoft is using its dominance of the
operating systems market to gain control of the Internet software
industry. By placing Internet Explorer on Windows 98, the updated
version of Windows 95, and excluding other browsers, they contend,
Microsoft stifles innovation and competition.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft officials argue that integrating the Internet browser
into Windows benefits users. They also say that the Internet has
become such a fundamental part of computer use that access to it
should be part of the any operating system.

   A browser is software that allows users to access information on
the Internet's World Wide Web, which offers text, pictures and

MICROSOFT ATTACKED BY SEN. HATCH AND RIVAL COMPANIES

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Software giant Microsoft came under attack again
Thursday from a leading senator and from executives of rival
companies, who called the firm a monopoly that threatens innovation
in the computer industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``The critical debate, many believe, is the extent to which
Microsoft is exploiting its current monopolies both to kill off
potential threats, and to leverage these monopolies to control new
technologies which will define the future of computing, of the
Internet and of how we conduct much of our daily lives,'' said Sen.
Orrin Hatch, R-Utah.
</P>
<P>
   Hatch, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, which was
holding its second hearing into Microsoft's business practices,
said the Redmond, Wash., company ``certainly appeared to have
engaged in anti-competitive behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   At a previous hearing in March, billionaire Microsoft Chairman
Bill Gates defended his company's actions as those of an
``aggressive'' firm. However, at Wednesday's hearing, neither Gates
nor any other Microsoft official testified before the committee.
</P>
<P>
   Hatch said he had asked Microsoft officials to come to the
hearing, but they declined. He added that some other companies
asked to testify on Microsoft's behalf had turned down the offer.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact is that our doors have not exactly been knocked down
with companies asking to defend Microsoft's business practices,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft, which is fighting an antitrust lawsuit by the Justice
Department and 20 states, said it would be inappropriate to appear
since the trial in that case is scheduled for September.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not clear that additional testimony from Microsoft will
serve any purpose,'' the company said in a statement, which noted
Hatch's frequent attacks.
</P>
<P>
   However, outside the hearing room, Microsoft did receive support
from Sen. Slade Gordon, R-Wash., who held a press conference only
minutes before the hearing started.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is nothing but another show for unsuccessful competitors
to make their complaints against one of America's most successful
companies,'' he said, adding that the hearing was ``another chapter
in Sen. Hatch's vendetta against Microsoft.''
</P>
<P>
   But inside the hearing room, heads of rival companies painted a
totally different picture of Microsoft and Gates.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Glasser, chairman of Seattle-based RealNetworks, which
makes software that allows people to watch video across the
Internet, said Microsoft was attempting to undermine his product.
</P>
<P>
   Glasser, who worked for Microsoft for 10 years and said he was a
friend of Gates, charged that Microsoft's version of the video
software, known as Windows Media Player, blocks consumers from
using his product.
</P>
<P>
   To prove his point, Glasser entered a site on the World Wide Web
and played a news video, which used his software product. Glasser
then downloaded Windows Media Player and re-entered the same Web
site. The video failed to play.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft, in a statement released responding to Glasser's
testimony, said the company ``does NOT disable'' the RealNetworks'
product.
</P>
<P>
   After Glasser testified, Sen. Robert Torricelli, D-N.J., read an
affidavit from a Microsoft official that accused the RealNetworks
chief of seeking to use his appearance before the committee as
leverage to force Microsoft to make a deal with his company.
</P>
<P>
   In the affidavit, Paul Maritz, a Microsoft vice president, said
that on Wednesday Glass offered to withdraw as a witness if
Microsoft would accept a new licensing agreement with RealNetworks.
Its current licensing agreement with Microsoft expired Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   While acknowledging that he spoke with Microsoft officials on
Wednesday, Glasser said it was only to brief them on what he was
going to say at the hearing. He called the claim that he tried to
force them into a deal ``completely untrue.''
</P>
<P>
   Another Gates' rival, Lawrence J. Ellison, chairman of Oracle
Corp., based in Redwood Shores, Calif., told the committee that
Microsoft would never be satisfied with only part of the software
market.
</P>
<P>
   ``Microsoft is already the most powerful company in the world,
and you ain't seen nothing yet,'' said the Ellison, whose company
is the world's second-largest independent software company.
</P>
<P>
   He said Microsoft was using the dominance of its Window's
operating system _ the program is installed in 95 percent of new
computers _ to stifle competition and take over other software
markets.
</P>
<P>
   Ellison said Microsoft's response to the success of Netscape
Corp.'s Navigator, the Mountain View, Calif., company's Internet
browser, has been typical of what he called Microsoft's
``predatory'' business practices.
</P>
<P>
   He said that when Netscape Navigator emerged as a key portal to
the World Wide Web, Microsoft quickly copied the technology and
introduced its own browser, called Internet Explorer. Microsoft
then added, or ``bundled,'' Internet Explorer to the company's
Windows program. The result is that people who buy a new computer
with Windows already installed no longer need Netscape Navigator.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Microsoft's share of the Internet browser market has
increased steadily for the last year, and the company now has
nearly 50 percent of the market. Netscape Navigator's share of the
market has fallen from around 80 percent to less than 50 percent in
that time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bill wants to add everything to Windows,'' Ellison said. ``And
every time he succeeds, that's the end of innovation in that
product.''

<P>
   &UR; FEATURE STORIES &LR;
</P>
<P>
   POLITICIANS-ARTS (Washington) _ Today as yesterday and the day
before, with Republicans as well as Democrats in control of the
White House, with Democratic as well as Republican majorities on
Capitol Hill, the arts and intellectual activity in general are
often bashed and seldom boosted by political Washington, left or
right. By R.W. Apple Jr. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   REAL-WAR-FILMS (Los Angeles) _ If we post World War II children
had been cleared-eyed, we would have noticed that the close-lipped
veterans who oversaw our lives really didn't resemble those
full-of-moxie, hell-for-leather fighting Joes on the screen. The
men we boys knew, the ones working 9 to 5, mowing lawns and
coaching Little League, had little of John Wayne's swagger. They
were just regular guys. But small boys aren't built to notice such
disparities, let alone reconcile them. Small boys, as a rule,
aren't realists. Distinguishing reality from fantasy is a
grown-up's task, and Steven Spielberg, another son of the postwar
generation, has fairly risen to it. There is, of course, some irony
in saying this of a filmmaker who has imagined 20th-century
dinosaurs and cuddly extraterrestrials. But in ``Saving Private
Ryan'' he is, as he was in ``Schindler's List,'' a realist. By
William McDonald. &UR; ( &LR; Moved).
 &UR;  &LR; 
 &UR; FILMS and VIDEO
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  POIRIER-FILMS &UR;  &LR; (Paris) _ Manuel Poirier's movie career got off
to a slow start. He was 40 by the time his first film was released,
and even then, forced to act as his own producer, he could afford
only one print. Yet, somehow, the right people saw it and liked it
and the doors that Poirier had been knocking on for years suddenly
opened. Within two years he had made three more movies, and the
last of these, ``Western,'' won the Grand Jury Prize at the 1997
Cannes International Film Festival. By Alan Riding. (Moved).
 &UR;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   GRAY-NEGOTIATOR-FILM (Los Angeles) _ An interview with the film
director, F. Gary Gray, 28, and his new movie ``The Negotiator.''
Gray, who grew up in tough South-Central Los Angeles came to
feature films through his directing of music videos for rap
artists. By Bernard Weinraub. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   PARENT-TRAP-FILM (Undated) _ At a recent advance screening of
Disney's remake of its classic 1961 film ``The Parent Trap,'' a
girl about 7 or 8 years old was overheard to say: ``You know what I
like about this movie? This is a family movie kids will like.''
This pint-size critic had put her thumb squarely on something that
has been tormenting Hollywood of late: how to create films that
will appeal to young moviegoers without alienating their parents.
By James Ryan. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THEATER &LR;

<P>
   CANBY-THEATER (London) _ Theater reviews of ``Twelfth Night'';
``Village''; ``Adam Resurrected'' and ``The Street of Crocodiles.''
By Vincent Canby. (Moved). Photo.
</P>
<P>
   JERRY-HERMAN-THEATER (Los Angeles) _ Jerry Herman is returning
to Broadway this week on a deeply personal note. The 66-year-old
composer-lyricist for such huge successes as ``Hello, Dolly!,''
``Mame'' and ``La Cage Aux Folles'' _ a Broadway figure who is both
a symbol of a golden era and an undervalued songwriter _ was
diagnosed with HIV 13 years ago and watched his health decline.
Since then with the help of protease inhibitors, which he takes
after every meal, the outgoing and perennially smiling composer
said his restored health _ he also had a triple heart bypass last
year _ energized him for the first time in a decade and has led to
``An Evening With Jerry Herman,'' starring Lee Roy Reams, Florence
Lacey and Herman himself at the Booth Theater for a two-month run
that opens on Tuesday. By Bernard Weinraub. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   JENKINS-SEATTLE-OPERA (Seattle) _ No one else runs an opera
company, or talks about opera, with the fervor of Speight Jenkins.
``You see, in `Tristan und Isolde,' Wagner wanted everyone in the
audience to experience his frustration in not being able to
consummate his love for Mathilde Wesendonck,'' Jenkins, the general
director of the Seattle Opera, said recently, warming to his
favorite topic. The Seattle Opera's new production of ``Tristan und
Isolde,'' which opens on Saturday evening, brings together the
hottest Wagner singers of the moment, the Canadian tenor Ben
Heppner and the English soprano Jane Eaglen, for the first time in
the title roles. By David Schiff. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; CLASSICAL MUSIC &LR;
</P>
<P>
   MAD-ARTISTS (Undated) _ In recent years there has been a lot of
interest, not least from composers, in the artistic productions of
people who would have once been called mad. By Paul Griffiths.
(Moved).
</P>
<P>
   OPERA-VOICES (subslug) (Undated) _ A Favorite stump-the-panel
segment on the Texaco Opera Quiz during the Saturday afternoon
radio broadcasts of the Metropolitan Opera is the ``singer ID.''
Recordings of, say, five unidentified tenors singing the same
phrase of a particular aria are played in a row, and the panelists
are asked to name them. It's amazing how difficult it can be to
recognize the voices of even famous tenors like Carlo Bergonzi or
Alfredo Kraus. By Anthony Tommasini. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   EAGLEN/SCHAFER-ALBUMS (Undated) _ Singers are forever trying to
create inventive programs, balancing art songs with arias, serious
material with lighter fare, the familiar with the novel. On
records, the challenge is perhaps even greater than in the concert
hall, for the choices must stand the tests of time and repeated
listening. How gratifying, then, to encounter two new cleverly
assembled vocal disks. Ostensibly these albums are similar, each
featuring a rising soprano singing music by Mozart and Richard
Strauss. By David Mermelstein. (Moved). Photo.

<P>
   CLASSICAL-BRIEFS (Undated) _ Brief reviews of classical music
CDs. (Moved).

   &UR; POP MUSIC &LR;

<P>
   PALMER-ROCK-FAME (Undated) _ When the Hall of Fame announces its
14th annual class of inductees this fall _ the selection process
began earlier this month _ it's a sure bet that Earl Palmer won't
be among them. Who? Though few people have heard of Palmer, this
73-year-old has had a greater impact on rock than many a Hall of
Fame shoo-in. By Tony Scherman. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   PULITZER-PRIZE-JAZZ (Undated) _ Trivia question: who was the
first jazz musician to win the Pulitzer Prize for music? Hint: it
wasn't Wynton Marsalis. The honor belongs to Mel Powell, who won in
1990 for a two-piano concerto called ``Duplicates.'' By Terry
Teachout. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ANTIQUES &LR;
</P>
<P>
   BUMPER-CARS-ANTIQUES (Undated) _ A look at Peter Foster, a
collector of bumper cars. Bumper cars were designed to operate
using electric power supplied from a metal-mesh ceiling, but
Foster's cars have been converted to 12-volt battery power, which
enables them to run on any hard, flat surface. By Seth Gussow.
(Moved).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ART &LR;
</P>
<P>
   PA-LANCASTER-ARCHITECTURE (Undated) _ The Lancaster sanctuary is
getting smaller, thanks in part to the car that conveys you into a
part of the world that retained its serenity until the postwar
years. In the last three years, more than 1,000 acres of farmland
in Lancaster County have vanished. The car culture has gulped down
big chunks of a landscape long associated with the horse-drawn
carriage. Open land has been turned into sites for suburban
subdivisions, big-box discount outlets and strip malls. By Herbert
Muschamp. (Moved). Photo.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; DANCE &LR;
</P>
<P>
   NY-CITY-BALLET (New York) _ The New York City Ballet is 50 years
old this year. So let's rejoice. The company and its affiliated
School of American Ballet are remarkable institutions, and George
Balanchine and Lincoln Kirstein, their founders, are heroic
figures. By Jack Anderson. (Moved).

   BLACKS-BIRTHRATE-NYT (Washington) _ Married black women gave
birth to 357,262 babies in 1970. But, by 1996, the last year for
which complete figures were available, that figure had dropped to
179,568, a decline of nearly 50 percent, nearly twice the drop in

   PATIENT-RIGHTS-NYT (Washington) _ The struggle over patients'
rights legislation has scrambled old alliances and created some

over how much regulation they can take. By Peter T. Kilborn.  &UR; Moved

   FILES-BLOOD-BOS _ Go ahead and swat, but the dreaded greenhead
fly driving its saw-like pincers into your thigh as you lie on the

are looking for an elusive protein in fly saliva that thins the
blood of victims, allowing greenheads to feed amply off the crimson

BC'S MARTY REASONER SIGNS WITH BLUES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB MONAHAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Boston College's NCAA runner-up hockey team suffered a
significant loss Thursday when All-America center and team captain
Marty Reasoner signed with the St. Louis Blues.
</P>
<P>
   Reasoner, who was drafted by the Blues as a freshman and has
been a force for the Eagles for three seasons, signed a reported $1
million deal. He is taking classes this summer, and a BC degree is
high on his agenda.
</P>
<P>
   A BC source said, ``Marty had to sign. What he was offered was
just too much to turn down. I feel he has the blessing of the
Boston College family.''
</P>
<P>
   In his three seasons as an Eagle, Reasoner played in 111 games,
collecting 69 goals and 93 assists for 162 points. He is tied for
11th on the all-time school scoring list with Billy O'Dwyer (1982)
and Doug Brown (1986).
</P>
<P>
   Efforts to reach coach Jerry York for comment Thursday were
unsuccessful, but he has said repeatedly, ``Marty is a high-caliber
person and player. He always demands respect. What too many people
don't realize is how dangerous he is even without the puck. He sees
the entire ice, plays two ways, and knows where everyone is all the
time.''
</P>
<P>
   During Reasoner's career, BC compiled records of 11-22-2,
16-17-3, and last season's 28-9-5 breakthrough. As a junior,
Reasoner played in all 42 games and had 33 goals and 40 assists. He
led the Eagles to the NCAA final, where they lost to Michigan in
overtime.
</P>
<P>
   There were only two seniors on the 1997-98 Eagles: defenseman
Ken Hemenway and forward Jamie O'Leary. With the departure of
Reasoner, York's next team will consist of eight seniors, five
juniors, and eight sophomores.
</P>
<P>
   Reasoner, a 6-foot-1-inch, 206-pounder from Honeoye Falls, N.Y.,
played for Team USA in the 1996 and '97 world championships, was
named Hockey East Rookie of the Year as a freshman, and earned
All-New England honors twice at Deerfield Academy, where he tallied
112 points in two seasons. He was named Hockey Night In Boston MVP
in 1995.

PATRIOTS DEEP IN YOUNG PLAYERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SMITHFIELD, R.I. _ The Patriots have 19 first- and second-year
draftees, plus undrafted second-year men like Mark Tate and Bernard
Russ who are playing well enough to make the 53-man squad.
</P>
<P>
   Some teams would call this rebuilding, but the Patriots merely
think of it as an example of constantly developing from within and
staying young, strong, and athletic to reinforce an established
core of players.
</P>
<P>
   With that mind-set, the Patriots are not apt to let many
youngsters go. They believe the players from last year's draft, who
did not receive high grades around the NFL, may make a contribution
this season. And Pete Carroll believes this rookie crop is far
ahead of its 1997 predecessor in terms of fitting into the system.
</P>
<P>
   So while the Patriots attempt to build a championship-caliber
team, they'll do it with a dose of youth that could amount to
almost a third of the roster.
</P>
<P>
   ``These guys are into our football now,'' said Carroll of the
'97 draftees. ``We're not seeing Florida State or somebody else's
stuff. We're seeing our stuff. They can line up and make some
calls. They can line up and make adjustments. That's pervading
throughout our offense and defense. You can see the quickness of
the decision-making right before your eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   Carroll thinks huge progress is being made by the young
offensive linemen _ Ed Ellis (University of Buffalo), Scott Rehberg
(Central Michigan), and Damon Denson (Michigan).
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a unit coming together with that second line,'' he
said. ``They came off the ball very nice in practice. They're
starting to get a feel for what's expected of them. I mean, they
had no clue last year. That helps. The whole idea is to get a
number of areas and just get a little bit better. That will make
our whole team better. The second-team defense understands line
calls. The end result will be it will make us a better football
team.''
</P>
<P>
   In the best of worlds, the younger players push the veterans.
That seems to be the case here.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm hoping that's happening,'' said Carroll. ``I know what the
competition is in certain areas. We did some one-on-one drills with
the offensive line against the defensive line today just so we can
start to get an accurate gauge of which guy is doing what against
whom. That's just one ingredient of making a decision. Today was
the most competitive camp we've had. There will be times we'll be
switching people to give our second guys a chance to play on the
first team. But we want to see what happens when (Heath) Irwin is
in with the first team or Rehberg has to step in.''
</P>
<P>
   While top 1998 pick Robert Edwards remains impressive with his
running and receiving ability (though he did fumble in the morning
session), Carroll also is pleased with sixth-round pick Harold
Shaw, a 6-foot, 240-pounder from Southern Mississippi.
</P>
<P>
   Shaw was breaking though the middle, shaking off tacklers, and
putting the hurt on the linebackers in practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's making a good impression,'' said Carroll. ``We're trying
to press the line of scrimmage with the backs and get them an
attitude about hitting the line of scrimmage. He had a pretty good
day. He got through some tackles. He worked pretty hard. We drafted
him knowing we were getting a bigger back. He's not spending too
much time juking from right to left. He's getting it done north and
south right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Shaw may make more of an impact on special teams, where Carroll
is looking for a spark.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's difficult to break into the starting lineup on this
team,'' said Carroll. ``We need a spark here and there. We're OK
and we have some areas where we're very good, but we need that
energy. Maybe it comes out of Marty (Moore) or (Larry) Whigham, but
if we can get it out of one or two other guys like Chris Floyd or
Russ or a Greg Spires and Harold can add to the group ...''
</P>
<P>
   Shaw said he hasn't played too much on special teams except for
returning kicks, but ``I think I can do it.''
</P>
<P>
   He feels comfortable sometimes but still has moments when he's
lost. So the best way for him to show something is to be physical.
</P>
<P>
   ``I try sometimes to hit them before they hit me to ease the
pain,'' said Shaw. ``Right now my goal is to make the team.''
</P>
<P>
   On the opposite side, Russ has been impressive, applying tough
hits on the running backs. Used mostly as a special-teams player
toward the end of the year, the West Virginia product has been
impressive as an outside linebacker. Ditto Vernon Crawford, last
year's fifth-round pick from Florida State, who has been excellent
on coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Also sticking out is Spires, a quick defensive end from Florida
State who at 6-1, 265, was supposed be too small for the NFL,
according to some draft experts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like this guy,'' said Carroll. ``He's a tough sucker. He's
had some problems with special teams and assignments and he's got a
ton to learn. If he can sustain the toughness and the intensity,
he's going to have a lot to offer us.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year's second-round pick, Brandon Mitchell from Texas A&AMP;M,
has also impressed the coaching staff, switching inside to
defensive tackle.
</P>
<P>
   Tate, who spent much of last year on the practice squad, may be
challenging Chris Canty at cornerback. With early injuries to Steve
Israel and Tebucky Jones, the 6-1, 185-pound Tate has had an
opportunity to showcase himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the guys we have were already here,'' said Willie
Clay. ``They get more confident and experience, and that creates
more competition. Everybody is getting better throughout the
system. Chris Canty has had a very good camp, and Mark is a guy who
keeps coming on.''
</P>
<P>
   With youth come mistakes, however. That's the inevitable
downside to having so many young players. When a young corner blows
his coverage, it could be a touchdown. When a young back fumbles,
it could turn the momentum of a game, or if he doesn't pick up
blitz coverage, it could get Drew Bledsoe injured. These are things
the Patriots will have to live with. They've decided that youth
will give them speed, athleticism, and a future.
</P>
<P>
   They hope they have enough veteran leadership to smooth over the
rough spots caused by inexperience.

HBO'S `MOON' MINISERIES LEADS EMMY FIELD 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By LAWRIE MIFFLIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Tom Hanks' 12-part HBO miniseries, ``From the
Earth to the Moon,'' earned the most Emmy Award nominations of any
program, with 17, and NBC earned the most of any network, with 86,
when nominations for the 1997-98 television season were announced
here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   HBO had 72 nominations, ABC 54, CBS 36 and Fox 35. The winners
will be announced in the 50th annual Emmy Awards broadcast on Sept.
13.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ally McBeal,'' the Fox comedy about a winsome young lawyer,
had a strong showing for a first-year comedy, earning 10
nominations, one fewer than NBC's ``Frasier,'' and tied with HBO's
``Larry Sanders Show'' and ABC's drama ``NYPD Blue.''
</P>
<P>
   The only shows that earned more nominations were the dramas
``ER'' (NBC) and ``The X-Files'' (Fox), with 16 each, and the NBC
miniseries ``Merlin,'' with 15.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ally McBeal's'' showing was also unusual because the program
is an hour long, and the most popular television comedies are a
half-hour.
</P>
<P>
   Also surprising, critics here for the television critics' press
tour said, was that Jerry Seinfeld received no acting nomination,
even though this was his show's last season. ``Seinfeld'' was
nominated for best comedy series and received four other
nominations, including best supporting actor in a comedy (Jason
Alexander) and supporting actress (Julia Louis-Dreyfuss).
</P>
<P>
   Critics were also surprised that neither ``Everybody Loves
Raymond,'' the CBS comedy, nor its star, Ray Romano, were
nominated.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Seinfeld, several other actors who are leaving roles
after long runs received nominations. They include Garry Shandling
(``Larry Sanders'') and Ellen DeGeneres (``Ellen'' on ABC) in the
comedy category, and Jimmy Smits (``NYPD Blue''), Andre Braugher
(NBC's ``Homicide: Life on the Street'') and Jane Seymour (CBS's
``Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman'').
</P>
<P>
   Calista Flockhart, who plays Ally McBeal, and Jenna Elfman, who
plays Dharma in the ABC comedy ``Dharma and Greg,'' were newcomers
to the best actress in a comedy category, joining Ms. DeGeneres,
Helen Hunt (NBC's ``Mad About You''), Patricia Richardson (NBC's
``Home Improvement'') and Kirstie Alley (NBC's ``Veronica's
Closet'').
</P>
<P>
   ``The Practice,'' ABC's drama about a group of hard-pressed
young lawyers in Boston, was the only newcomer in the best dramatic
series category, joining ``ER,'' ``NYPD Blue,'' ``The X-Files'' and
NBC's ``Law and Order,'' last year's winner. Nominated along with
``Seinfeld'' for best comedy were ``Ally McBeal,'' ``Frasier,''
``Larry Sanders'' and ``Third Rock From the Sun.'' Writer David E.
Kelley earned an unusual double, with nominations as best writer
for both a comedy series (``Ally McBeal'') and a drama (``The
Practice'').
</P>
<P>
   As has become its habit, HBO dominated the made-for-television
movie category, with three of the five nominations: ``A Bright
Shining Lie,'' ``Don King: Only in America,'' and ``Gia.''
Showtime's ``12 Angry Men'' and CBS's ``What the Deaf Man Heard''
received the others.
</P>
<P>
   Last year HBO received attention for nearly equaling the top
broadcast network, NBC, in nominations (92 to 90). This year, HBO's
total was less surprising. Down most dramatically, though, was CBS,
from 60 nominations to 36.
</P>
<P>
   PBS earned 14 nominations for prime-time shows, down from 18
last year, including for outstanding nonfiction series (``The
American Experience'') and outstanding nonfiction special
(``American Masters: Don Hewitt, 90 Minutes on `60 Minutes'''), and
several performance specials.

MARKET PLACE: BUSTING `BOILER ROOMS' 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Texas, Mo.)  (mk) 
 By DAVID BARBOZA   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ State securities regulators said Thursday that they
had brought enforcement actions against 75 brokerage and investment
firms across the country for using high-pressure sales tactics to
mislead and defraud thousands of investors.
</P>
<P>
   The actions, by more than 29 state regulators, amount to one of
the biggest crackdowns ever on ``boiler rooms'' of telephone
salespeople who prey on gullible or naive investors. The regulators
netted about three times as many firms as they did in a similar
sweep of fraudulent brokerage practices a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   The targets are mostly small, little-known investment houses
accused of using fast-talking stockbrokers to push an array of
speculative securities and investment deals, everything from
worthless penny stocks to a stake in the profits of an infomercial
company that hawks talking dog tags.
</P>
<P>
   The regulators said they focused on boiler rooms because of
their stubborn resilience in the current bull market. Boiler rooms,
which have been around for decades, are crowded offices with banks
of telephones staffed by brokers, often reading from detailed
scripts, who call investors and pressure them to make hasty
financial decisions.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's an overwhelming number of complaints related to boiler
rooms these days,'' said Denise Voigt Crawford, commissioner of the
state securities board in Texas, which took part in the crackdown.
``Scam artists are following the headlines and pushing worthless
securities.''
</P>
<P>
   The state regulators said that in the last few weeks they had
filed more than 100 actions, everything from criminal indictments
to small fines, against 75 firms for using abusive sales tactics
and fraudulent schemes in peddling micro-cap stocks, foreign
exchange investments and even investments in ostrich meat.
</P>
<P>
   According to the transcript of one call, a broker tried to
persuade someone _who turned out to be an enforcement agent _ to
invest in a speculative initial public offering. The broker, who
said his brokerage firm was a ``very prestigious IPO kitten,''
played down the speculative nature of the investment. ``The risk
factor is very simple, you know, you could lose your money, of
course, I mean in anything that you do,'' he said. ``But that's
irrelevant because we're looking to see the stock go up, not
down.''
</P>
<P>
   Regulators and law enforcement officials believe that because of
the length and strength of the current bull market, many small
investors have come to view big returns as commonplace and thereby
fall victim to conniving brokers who promise spectacular returns in
what brokers may call the next Intel or Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bull market has made the work of scam artists much
easier,'' said Ms. Crawford in Texas. ``When investors are getting
30 to 40 percent returns on mutual funds, it's not hard to convince
them they can make more in penny stocks.''
</P>
<P>
   By coordinating their enforcement actions, the regulators say
they hope to put a dent in the pervasive fraud associated with
boiler rooms and micro-cap stocks. The regulators cast a much wider
net than a year ago, when they brought similar actions against
several individuals and 14 firms, almost all based in the New York
area. This time the enforcement effort stretched from New Hampshire
to Alaska, with a large and growing concentration of boiler rooms
found in California.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In recent weeks, the regulators moved to revoke brokerage
licenses, issue cease-and-desist orders, levy fines and shut down
brokerage firms that engage in sales fraud.
</P>
<P>
   It is not a crime for a broker to sell an investor a security
that loses value, but it is illegal to guarantee investment returns
or to intentionally mislead investors into buying securities that
are clearly unsuitable for them, or even worthless.
</P>
<P>
   ``These folks aren't giving the investors the information they
need to make an informed decision,'' said Douglas Wilburn, state
securities commissioner in Missouri. ``In fact, they're lying to
them, promising them guaranteed returns.''
</P>
<P>
   While the enforcement actions have curtailed some boiler room
operations, regulators say that many boiler rooms continue to
operate, some by moving from place to place and operating under
different names. Regulators encourage investors to check a broker's
background with state regulatory agencies and the National
Association of Securities Dealers, each of which maintains
disciplinary files on brokerage firms and individual brokers.
</P>
<P>
   Wilburn in Missouri said many of the defrauded investors made
little effort to find out about the brokers or the securities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of these people are so gullible, so naive,'' he said.
``It's very depressing to find people who believe anything they're
told.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the companies that were accused of sales fraud were:
Biltmore Securities, Duke &AMP; Co., Lloyd Wade Securities, Royal Palm

10 `ALLY MCBEAL' NOMINATIONS CHEER WRITER KELLEY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DON AUCOIN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; More than surprise, more than jubilation, ``Ally McBeal''
creator David E. Kelley felt a bone-deep sense of relief Thursday
when he learned that his Boston-based TV series had won 10 Emmy
Award nominations in the best comedy category.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone, you see, has gotten the joke.
</P>
<P>
   Whether she is pursuing her law career, her romances, or that
elusive Dancing Baby, Ally McBeal exists in a state of comic
dither. The punditocracy has responded to the miniskirted fidgeter
with a resounding harrumph; just last month Time magazine ran a
photo of the star of ``Ally McBeal'' above this portentous inquiry:
``Is Feminism Dead?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of me was probably desperate for it to be declared a
comedy,'' Kelley said in an interview with the Globe. ``We get so
many letters that take episodes to heart: `How dare you do this or
that?' ''
</P>
<P>
   ``Our response is usually: `The show is a comedy. Don't take us
too seriously,' '' he added. ``Now that the Emmys have declared us
a comedy, maybe everyone will get the message that we're not
speaking for society; we're speaking for Ally.''
</P>
<P>
   NBC led the Emmy-nomination parade with 86, including 11 for
``Frasier,'' the top-nominated comedy. Next was HBO with 72
nominations, including an Emmy-leading 17 for Tom Hanks' 12-part
miniseries on the space program, ``From the Earth to the Moon.'' In
third place was ABC with 54, including, ironically enough,
nominations for the canceled ``Ellen'' and its star, Ellen
DeGeneres. Fourth was CBS with 36, followed by Fox, with 35 _
including the 10 nominations for ``Ally McBeal'' _ and TNT with 18.
</P>
<P>
   The cascade of Emmy nominations capped a remarkable year for the
protean, 40-year-old Kelley, a 1983 graduate of Boston University
Law School who practiced law in Boston before heading to Hollywood,
where he married actress Michelle Pfeiffer five years ago.
</P>
<P>
   In a feat that astonished many in the television industry,
Kelley wrote all 22 episodes of ``Ally McBeal'' last year as well
as most of the 22 episodes of ABC's ``The Practice,'' a
Boston-based legal drama he created that also was nominated in the
best drama series category.
</P>
<P>
   While ``Ally McBeal'' became the first hourlong show in three
decades to be nominated as a comedy, Kelley admitted that the
nomination of ``The Practice,'' a show that he said had been ``kind
of forsaken,'' was perhaps most gratifying of all.
</P>
<P>
   ``A year ago `The Practice' was on Saturday night, and ABC's
statement to the contrary notwithstanding, they put it there to
die,'' he said. ``Now, here we are a year later with a good time
slot on Monday nights and an Emmy nomination.''
</P>
<P>
   Hanks, who left television 15 years ago to become a movie star
after the forgettable ``Bosom Buddies'' was canceled, climaxed his
triumphant return to the medium with a harvest of nominations for
``From the Earth to the Moon,'' a miniseries for which he served as
executive producer (he also acted in one part and directed
another).
</P>
<P>
   In awarding more nominations to ``From the Earth to the Moon''
than to any other show or series, the Academy of Television Arts &AMP;
Sciences delivered a stinging rebuff to the broadcast networks. The
networks had protested the submission of ``From the Earth'' into
the miniseries category, arguing that it was too long to be so
considered.
</P>
<P>
   It was the latest and most bitter chapter in a long-running
battle between broadcasters and the cable networks over whether
cable outlets enjoy an unfair advantage in the miniseries
competition because they can devote more time and money to a few
big projects per year, while broadcast networks must program 22
prime-time hours per week.
</P>
<P>
   In another sign of the inroads cable has made into the dominance
of broadcast networks, 15 cable networks received a total of 139
Emmy nominations, the most ever for cable programming.
</P>
<P>
   The pace-setting showing by ``Frasier'' will hearten programmers
at the Peacock Network who recently anointed the urbane sitcom as
the Thursday-night successor to ``Seinfeld'' this fall. The
most-nominated dramas were NBC's ``ER'' and Fox's ``The X-Files,''
tied at 16 nominations apiece.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Kelley, Hanks, and ``Frasier,'' Emmy smiled upon
numerous actors and TV shows that will no longer be on the air when
the winners of the 50th Annual Primetime Emmy Awards are announced
on Sept. 13.
</P>
<P>
   Phil Hartman, slain by his wife in May in a murder-suicide, was
nominated as best supporting actor for his role in NBC's
``NewsRadio.''
</P>
<P>
   Numerous stars and shows that won't be returning were also
nominated: NBC's ``Seinfeld'' (though series creator and star Jerry
Seinfeld was snubbed); HBO's ``The Larry Sanders Show'' and its
star, Garry Shandling; ABC's canceled ``Ellen'' and its star, Ellen
DeGeneres; Jane Quinn of ``Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman'', which CBS
canceled over Quinn's vehement objection; Andre Braugher of NBC's
``Homicide''; and Jimmy Smits of ABC's ``NYPD Blue,'' who will
leave after a few more episodes.
</P>
<P>
   As for David E. Kelley, he is staying right where he is, with
his nose to the most creative grindstone in television today.
</P>
<P>
   Observing that ``Ally McBeal'' is ``kind of a different
animal,'' he said he intends to write most episodes of the show for
the upcoming season, though he said he may delegate some of ``The
Practice'' scriptwriting chores.
</P>
<P>
   Kelley freely acknowledged that ``Ally McBeal'' does not contain
as much Boston flavor as ``The Practice.'' He said he set ``Ally''
in Boston for ``economic reasons,'' noting that it was more
efficient for his production company in gathering courtroom
exteriors and other scene-setting shots.
</P>
<P>
   According to TV historian Alex McNeil, ``Ally McBeal'' is the
first hourlong show since ``Love, American Style'' in 1969-70 to be
nominated as best comedy series. (``Love, American Style'' later
switched to a half-hour).
</P>
<P>
   Kelley makes clear that he will continue to chronicle Love, Ally
Style in his own inimitable fashion, regardless of brickbats from
the humor-impaired.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were really braced for that reaction right away,'' he said.
``Even during the development of the pilot, I said `You do realize
this will be ripe for attack, because there will be people out
there who will say how dare you create this character who's smart
and has a degree of sophistication and success and yet somehow
declares herself empty because she doesn't have a man' '' and is
otherwise willing to admit confusion in her life.
</P>
<P>
   Kelley himself was feeling anything but empty as the Emmy news
rolled in.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're in production, you can't take too many moments,''
he said, adding jokingly. ``I vicariously take a moment through
Peter MacNicol's character on `Ally' (`the Biscuit'). But I'd be
lying if I didn't say we're all thrilled today.''

JAPANESE UNLIKELY TO BE HAPPY WITH NEXT PRIME MINISTER, POLLS
SHOW 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By STEPHANIE STROM    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ If the Japanese public had its way, Foreign Minister
Keizo Obuchi would not become the next prime minister. But a day
before the vote to choose the man who will almost certainly lead
the country, the reserved Obuchi looked like a sure bet for the
job.
</P>
<P>
   Opinion polls show voters clamoring for his two rivals: the
veteran politician Seiroku Kajiyama and the upstart Health and
Welfare Minister Junichiro Koizumi. But the electorate's opinion
has little real influence because Friday's vote is to choose a new
president of the governing Liberal Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   Party members will therefore be doing the choosing, although the
man they select is all but certain of being prime minister because
the Liberal Democrats control the lower house of Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the week junior party members seemed about to rebel
against the back-room power-broking among factions that has long
settled the pecking order in Japanese politics. But Thursday more
and more seemed to be reluctantly coming to the conclusion that the
best way to achieve their goals was to toe the lines drawn by party
leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have been explaining my decision to my constituents, knowing
that some people would react very strongly against my choice of Mr.
Obuchi,'' said Yoshitaka Shindo, 40, a legislator whose district is
in Saitama Prefecture. ``I tell them about his general abilities
and decision-making abilities, and I think people understand it.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Shindo, who is a member of Obuchi's faction, is
well aware that his choice bears significant political risks. Like
many younger members of the party, he knows that if Obuchi does not
move quickly to repair this country's ailing financial system and
set the economy back on track, he himself will probably lose his
job in the next lower house election.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Obuchi-san falls, I will fall and the party will fall,''
Shindo said. ``But I am ready to commit collective suicide.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the public's disgust with political business as usual
grows more apparent every day. Thursday's Yomiuri Shimbun, one of
Japan's largest papers, published a poll showing that the Liberal
Democratic Party's approval rating had sunk 8 percent since June to
a record low of 20.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a strong weapon for us,'' said Taro Kono, a 35-year-old
party member who is ignoring the lead of his faction leader, former
Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa, and supporting Kajiyama. ``We're
going around knocking on members' doors and handing them a copy of
the paper.''
</P>
<P>
   It is clear that this election, to choose a successor to Ryutaro
Hashimoto, who resigned after the party suffered a decisive setback
in upper house elections on July 12, is causing more soul-searching
among party members than any in the past. For the first time that
anyone can remember, there is a ``floating'' vote of about 10
percent to 20 percent of the party membership that refuses to be
pinned down by pollsters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the race is decided yet,'' said Nobutero
Ishihara, a young legislator from a district in Tokyo.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Indeed, party members like Kono and Ishihara have been pushing
for ways to insure the secrecy of each vote on Friday in hopes that
a truly secret ballot might result in a last-minute shift of
alliances.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday night the head of the party's election committee said
the panel would do its utmost to insure privacy around the voting
box. In the past it was not unusual for party members to scribble
the name of the candidate they supported onto a piece of paper and
show it to colleagues before stuffing it into a ballot box.
</P>
<P>
   Little effort was made to make the voting secret, either by
printed ballots to protect votes from being identified by the
handwriting or by providing a booth in which to vote.
</P>
<P>
   But whether a more secret process will tilt the vote out of
Obuchi's favor is unclear.
</P>
<P>
   Some legislators who are struggling with their choice are coming
to the conclusion that while he may not be the best man for the
job, Obuchi is the best of the three contenders.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best person to become party head is Mr. Kato,'' said
Yoshitaka Murata, a junior member whose district is in Okayama
Prefecture, referring to Koichi Kato, the secretary general of the
party and a leader of the Miyazawa faction. ``So we are forced to
choose between second best or even lower-rated people.''
</P>
<P>
   Murata considers Obuchi his best choice, even though in a poll
of his constituents Obuchi placed last.
</P>
<P>
   ``We politicians, while we listen to our constituents, our job
is also to persuade them,'' he said. ``I will explain to them why I
voted for Mr. Obuchi and why he is best and maybe they will
understand.'' &QL;

BRITISH PLOTTED TO KILL HITLER, NEWLY RELEASED DOCUMENTS SHOW 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By WARREN HOGE   c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ British agents planned a series of bizarre plots to
assassinate Adolf Hitler during the last months of World War II,
according to wartime papers made public Thursday by the Public
Records Office.
</P>
<P>
   A 120-page dossier prepared by the secret Special Operations
Executive, a unit charged with wreaking havoc behind enemy lines,
laid out elaborately detailed operations to eliminate Hitler,
complete with maps and photographs of his living areas and notes on
his personal habits.
</P>
<P>
   The recommended approaches included sniper attacks on him as he
took his morning stroll, the aerial bombardment and paratrooper
assault of his Berchtesgaden Alpine retreat, blowing up his
personal train, the Fuehrerzug, as it went through a tunnel,
poisoning his tea and impregnating his clothes with anthrax.
</P>
<P>
   The outlandish plans were never acted upon because there was
sufficient objection to delay them and the war was winding down,
with Hitler becoming an increasingly erratic and unreliable leader.
High-ranking British officers argued that his strategic blundering
made him more valuable to the Allies alive than dead.
</P>
<P>
   The undertaking was called Operation Foxley and was cleared by
Foreign Secretary Anthony Eden and reported to Prime Minister
Winston Churchill as a project endorsed by his defense chiefs. The
head of the unit, Maj. Gen. Colin Gubbins, gathered his senior
staff officers together in the War Office in June 1944 and said
they would have to discover Hitler's whereabouts and practices and
then work out a way to ``deal with him.''
</P>
<P>
   Rallying his men, Gubbins said: ``At some time or other in the
near future, Hitler must in any case disappear from the scene, even
if we should not be the direct agents for his elimination, and we
can at least prepare such action to be taken on his disappearance
as will contribute best towards the situation most favorable to the
Allied nations.''
</P>
<P>
   Maj. Field Robertson, head of the secret office's German
section, thought the notion foolhardy and argued passionately
against it. He warned that the Germans would ``canonize'' Hitler as
a martyr, while it would be disastrous for the Allies if it was
believed they had had to resort to ``low methods'' because they
were unable to defeat the Germans militarily.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a strategist, Hitler has been of the greatest possible
assistance to the British war effort,'' he said, adding, ``I have
no hesitation in saying that his value to us has been the
equivalent to an almost unlimited number of first-class SOE agents
strategically placed inside Germany.''
</P>
<P>
   Expressing the view that prevailed, the Special Operations
Executive's air adviser, Vice Marshal A.P. Ritchie, said Hitler had
a ``mystical hold'' on the German people. ``Remove Hitler, and
there is nothing left,'' he concluded.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   According to the blueprint, Hitler was most vulnerable to sniper
attack as he took the same leisurely 15-minute walk each morning to
a teahouse at Berchtesgaden. He was guarded from a distance since
``he cannot bear to feel himself watched,'' the dossier said, and
this gave agents, dressed in fake German mountain-troop uniforms,
the opportunity to place themselves in strategic positions
undetected.
</P>
<P>
   If their mission failed, two other assassins would be lying in
wait around the corner with antitank rocket launchers to destroy
his car as he was driven back to the Berghof, his private
residence.
</P>
<P>
   In the train scenario saboteurs would lay remote-control charges
on tracks without arousing guards' suspicions because they would be
dressed as railway police officers and accompanied by a man in the
kind of suit that Gestapo men favored. The report said that tunnels
and bridges were less well guarded in Germany than in the occupied
territories and that, with all able men at the front, the quality
of the railroad watchers was low.
</P>
<P>
   The report detected one difficulty in the plan to poison his tea
_ the drug to be used, codenamed ``I,'' made tea cloudy _ and laid
out a solution.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hitler, according to reliable information, is a tea addict,''
it said. ``But he always drinks it with milk. Since the milk is
poured first into the cup, it is unlikely that its opalescence
would be noticed as it came from the teapot.''

   ROME _ Seeking to curb the independence of bishops, Pope John
Paul II issued an apostolic letter Thursday that tightens the
Vatican's control over 108 bishops' conferences around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Under the new rules, it would be almost impossible for the
National Conference of Catholic Bishops in the United States to
issue major, binding statements on topics like nuclear weapons,
homosexuality or the status of women, that diverged from the
Vatican view.
</P>
<P>
   The apostolic letter, the most authoritative papal document
after an encyclical, was welcomed by the head of the National
Conference of Catholic Bishops, but it caused consternation among
many American clergymen and theologians, who worried that it would
diminish local leaders' ability to deal directly with problems
endemic to their own parishes.
</P>
<P>
   On doctrinal and theological matters, the apostolic letter
requires unanimity of all members before a bishops' conference can
issue a binding statement to its followers. Even if a document wins
an overwhelming majority, it must still be sent to Rome for
approval. Until now, the U.S. bishops' conference and others had
relied on a two-thirds majority to issue important statements.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not talking about practical issues that a majority can
decide,'' said Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, who heads the
Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith and who led the drafting
of the apostolic letter. ``We are talking about doctrine, that is
to say, the truth. The truth is not arrived at by majority.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Particularly in the past, many bishops' conferences had brashly
sought autonomy from the Vatican when passing judgment on domestic
social issues.
</P>
<P>
   Pope John Paul II cracked down on advocates of ``liberation
theology'' among Latin American bishops' conferences in the early
1980s. He has dismissed dissident Catholic theologians, and he has
replaced many of the more liberal cardinals and bishops in the
United States and Europe with more conservative men.
</P>
<P>
   Because of pressure from Rome, the National Conference of
Catholic Bishops of today is far more conciliatory toward Rome than
it was 10 years ago and rarely takes important steps without first
consulting the Holy See. Yet it has found other ways to reflect its
differences on certain issues.
</P>
<P>
   Last year the administrative board of the National Conference of
Catholic Bishops, for instance approved the release of a pastoral
message to parents of homosexual children urging them to be
compassionate, not censorious. The church teaching is that
homosexual activity is a sin in all circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   The message was not voted on by the full body of the conference,
whose approval is needed before statements can be considered
morally binding on all American Catholics. Should the U.S. bishops
seek to give it even greater weight, they would now need every
voting bishop in America to approve it.
</P>
<P>
   Bishop Anthony Pilla, president of the National Conference of
Catholic Bishops, said in a statement that he applauded the letter,
which ``clarifies a situation that has been under discussion for
more than a decade.''
</P>
<P>
   Ten years ago more than two-thirds of U.S. bishops voted to
sharply reject an early working draft of Thursday's document, which
seemed to reduce the bishops' role in interpreting Catholic
teachings for their American followers. The Vatican agreed to
revise it, but the new version does not significantly change the
Vatican's view of its own primacy in deciding doctrinal matters.
</P>
<P>
   Mostly, the change affects only the most important statements on
matters of doctrine and morality. And under this pope in
particular, few bishops' conferences issue sweeping instructions to
their followers without first checking with Rome.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the big doctrinal questions, I do not see any major changes
to the way we already conduct business,'' said Msgr. Louis Marie
Bille, president of France's National Council of Bishops. Before
the French conference issued a new catechism in 1991, they obtained
Vatican permission first.
</P>
<P>
   But individual French bishops as well as a committee of the
conference issued a statement in 1995 that condoned the use of
condoms to prevent the spread of AIDS. It was contentious and
widely reported, even though it did not have the backing of the
full conference of bishops.
</P>
<P>
   There are other areas and countries where doctrine and practical
pastoral issues collide. When Ratzinger was asked about the U.S.
bishops' message to parents of homosexual children, he replied that
it was wise of the U.S. church to issue it at a less authoritative,
``experimental level.'' He noted that while it was largely a
pastoral issue, it contained ``doctrinal sensitivities'' that,
should the conference decide to elevate it into a binding
``pastoral letter,'' would require either a unanimous vote or
Rome's approval.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unanimity is completely impractical,'' said the Rev. Thomas
Reese, editor of the Jesuit magazine America. ``There will always
be a bishop that disagrees with even a minor point on a given
subject. We didn't expect even ecumenical councils like Vatican II
to be unanimous.''
</P>
<P>
   The alternative of seeking the approval of Rome, he said, would
necessarily be ponderous and slow. ``This will tie the hands of the
bishops' conferences, and make it difficult to be creative in
responding to the pastoral needs of their people,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But the Vatican does not appear to want its bishops to be too
creative. ``Creativity can be found here _ this is the place for
creativity,'' Cardinal Miloslav Vlk said Thursday, banging on a
podium in Rome. Vlk, a Czech, was one of the Vatican leaders who
presented the apostolic letter to reporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are aware that the development of a pluralistic society
that exalts liberty, the individual, democracy and differences
inevitably influences the churches and their bishops,'' he said.
``Without opportune mediation, this can lead to a search, not
always illuminated, for more independence, decentralization and
autonomy in local churches.''

   PANTHOU, Sudan _ She straggled into the government-held town of
Wau on Tuesday on legs no thicker than broomsticks, a gaunt and
skeletal figure with hollow eyes, her skin hanging loose over her
bones.
</P>
<P>
   She said she had left three of her children under a tree a few
miles back. They were too weak to go on after a four-day walk from
Gogrial County to find food. Three other children had already died
of starvation, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have run out of everything,'' the woman, Akon Akol Ding,
said weakly, as she waited with a half gourd in her hands for aid
workers to give her something to eat. ``Our cows have been looted.
There has been no rain, so we don't cultivate.''
</P>
<P>
   Outside a compound on the northern outskirts of Wau, there were
more than 100 newly dug graves with rude wooden markers. They were
shallow. The smell of human corpses hung above the turned-up brown
earth.
</P>
<P>
   Inside, a few aid workers were doling out sugar water in plastic
cups to new arrivals like Mrs. Ding. The people who had not yet
died sat and lay in rows in a dirt courtyard, emaciated, weak and
incoherent, raising their empty hands and bleary eyes to visitors
in a silent request for sustenance. Many had walked for several
days to reach Wau. Some had seen their children and other loved
ones starve to death on the road.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a massive airlift of more than 12,000 tons of food over
the last three and a half months, a famine has begun to take a
significant number of lives in some parts of Bahr el Ghazal state
in southern Sudan.
</P>
<P>
   Aid officials say the severe shortage of food is likely to
worsen in the next six months because the rains that normally fuel
the next harvest in October have arrived late and are falling
sporadically.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the rough terrain and poor communications in Sudan,
it is unclear precisely how many people are dying, aid officials
say.
</P>
<P>
   But in the town of Wau alone between 20 and 50 people are
perishing every day, United Nations nurses say. Tuesday morning, 51
people died of starvation and famine-related illnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout southern Sudan, U.N. officials estimate, at least 1.2
million people face severe food shortages this year, though most
people have not yet reached the point of starvation.
</P>
<P>
   Still, people have begun dying in significant numbers in several
communities where refugees displaced by fighting earlier this year
are camped, a visit to two rebel-held communities and the
government-held garrison town of Wau revealed.
</P>
<P>
   In rebel territory, the worst-hit community appears to Ajiep, a
town 20 miles north of Wau where more than 6,000 displaced people
are camped near a dirt airstrip. More than 20 children died last
week in feeding centers in Ajiep. Aid workers there estimate at
least six adults are dying every day.
</P>
<P>
   In another sign that the situation is deteriorating, a June
survey of children in nine Bar el Ghazal villages showed at least
one in every five is severely malnourished, far above what would be
expected in a normal year.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the people dying are among more than 100,000 refugees
who fled from Wau and other towns in Aweil and Gogrial counties in
February after a flare-up in the 15-year-old war. Wandering for the
last three months, the majority of these refugees have been
surviving on wild fruits and greens.
</P>
<P>
   Since May, about 60,000 people have trickled into Wau in search
of food. Many are on their last legs after traveling long distances
from northern Bahr el Ghazal. Several other towns where the United
Nations has set up feeding centers have become magnets for starving
people throughout the region, including Ajiep, Panthou and Mapel.
</P>
<P>
   The current crisis began in February, when local warlord
Kerubino Kuanyin Bol, who had been fighting for the government,
rejoined the rebellion and attacked the garrison in Wau. That set
off a new round of violence in Sudan's seemingly endless civil war
between the Moslem north and the predominantly Christian south.
</P>
<P>
   The fighting exacerbated an already dismal situation. After two
years of drought and bad harvests, most farmers in Bahr el Ghazal
had few seed stores left to plant when 1998 began, and while the
people in this flat savannah usually face lean months in June and
July, constant cattle raids and guerrilla fighting in recent years
has undermined their traditional ways of getting through hungry
times.
</P>
<P>
   The flood of refugees from Wau and other insecure regions
overburdened communities whose food resources were already
stretched to the limit, aid workers say.
</P>
<P>
   Most families in the region have eaten all the seed stores they
had planned to use for planting. Others have lost most of their
cattle in raids by Arab militias allied with the government and
rogue rebel factions over the last decade of war.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of the traditional coping mechanisms are shot,'' said
Ted Chaban, the deputy chief of operations for the U.N. Childrens'
Fund in southern Sudan. ``There is definitely a famine in certain
pockets of Bahr El Ghazal and there are a larger number of places
in a pre-famine mode.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the Islamic government in Khartoum and the main rebel
faction _ the Sudan People's Liberation Army, led by John Garang _
agreed to a one-month cease-fire to help relief reach the hungry,
but aid officials say the truce has come too late. The rainy season
has finally arrived, a month late in many places, making it nearly
impossible for aid workers to deliver food on the ground in any
cargo.
</P>
<P>
   Even with a complete halt in fighting, aid officials said, there
remain major logistical barriers on the transportation routes into
the region, from flooded roads, to bandits along rail lines, to
clogged river channels.
</P>
<P>
   ``The crisis for the aid agencies is far from over,'' said
Michelle Quintaglie, a spokeswoman for the World Food Program.
``Even if everyone laid down their weapons right now, we would not
be able to rush in there with thousands of tons of food because of
the terrain we are dealing with in Sudan.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Every morning, four huge C-130 cargo planes take off from a base
at Lokichoggio in northern Kenya while a fifth flies out of El
Obeid in northern Sudan, carrying tons of grain in the largest
airlift of food in the World Food Program's history.
</P>
<P>
   The planes fly to 38 locations in Bahr el Ghazal and drop tons
of food in 100-pound bags. Aid workers on the ground distribute the
food to starving children at emergency clinics as well as parceling
it out to the general population.
</P>
<P>
   The airlift operation alone is costing more than $21 million a
month, and though 12,000 tons have been shipped into the region in
the last three months, more is needed to avert a full-scale
catastrophe, U.N. officials say.
</P>
<P>
   With another poor harvest predicted for this fall, relief
officials say they expect the airlift will have to continue through
at least another 18 months to avert a cataclysmic famine like the
one that killed nearly 250,000 people in Sudan in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   It was that crisis that prompted the United Nations to set up
Operation Lifeline Sudan, the relief operation that is still in
progress.
</P>
<P>
   The current phase of Sudan's civil war has been dragging on
since 1983, and more than 1.5 million people have died in fighting
and in two previous famines spawned by the violence.
</P>
<P>
   There is a growing consensus among diplomats and U.N. officials
that famines like the one taking root here are inevitable as long
as the war grinds on and peace talks founder.
</P>
<P>
   ``The solution to this won't come from humanitarian
intervention, it has to be political,'' said Carol Bellamy, the
executive director of the U.N. Children's Fund, who visited Wau and
other distribution sites here this week. ``The pressure for
resolving this war has to come from outside.''
</P>
<P>
   The rebels, who maintain they represent the majority in the
mostly Christian and animist south, say they have been fighting to
free themselves from what they see as a repressive Islamic regime
in Khartoum, dominated by people of Arab origin.
</P>
<P>
   But while rebel leaders say they are struggling for religious
freedom, a secular government and more autonomy, their movement has
been crippled for years by factional fighting and tribal divisions.
</P>
<P>
   Several rounds of talks have failed to produce peace. Last year,
the Khartoum government signed a separate peace accord with six
Southern rebel factions, agreeing to lift Islamic laws in the south
and to hold a referendum on independence within four years.
</P>
<P>
   But Garang's Sudan People's Liberation Army has continued to
fight, arguing the government's promises are nothing but tricks to
buy time and divide the rebellion. A fresh round of talks is
scheduled to take place in Addis Ababa next month, and an extended
ceasefire is likely to be on the agenda.
</P>
<P>
   For many people in Bahr el Ghazal, a peace agreement cannot come
soon enough.
</P>
<P>
   The children are the first to die. In the town of Mapel, three
children are dying each week at a feeding center for the severely
malnourished run by Doctors Without Borders.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, there were dozens of shrunken children at the center
receiving emergency rations. Sitting on plastic sheets in the dust
of a shady grove, tired mothers spoon-fed emaciated babies formula
and gruel.
</P>
<P>
   One infant, Aken Akol, was near death. His cheeks were sunken
into his miniature face, and his body had been reduced to a
birdlike skeleton covered with wrinkled skin. An aid worker poured
a sugar-and-salt solution into his mouth, which he gulped
desperately. His mother, Angam Mawien, sat next to them, too
malnourished to produce milk.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what has happened,'' his mother, Angam Mawien,
said, pinching her empty breasts. ``God has created a drought.''
</P>
<P>
   Like many towns affected by the crisis, Mapel is a paradox.
Since the rains arrived two weeks ago, the place has turned green
and lush. The people are surviving fairly well and have pinned
their hopes on the next harvest. But they have nothing extra to
give to the displaced who have arrived hungry and without
belongings.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have big problems here,'' said Peter Madhieu, a civilian
official in Mapel. ``Many people have migrated from other counties
because of hunger.''
</P>
<P>
   A hundred miles to the north, a similar scene has unfolded in
the village of Panthou, where at least a quarter of the children
are severely malnourished despite the fact that local farmers have
a good crop of corn coming up.
</P>
<P>
   Lured by the promise of food, thousands of starving people have
been pouring into Panthou from other parts of Aweil and Gogrial
counties. Many have been pushed by Arab militias who have been
raiding Dinka villages along a nearby railway since April.
</P>
<P>
   ``This year is good because the crops are growing well, as long
as the rains continue this way,'' one elder in Panthou, Kuol Chuny,
said. ``But the little being cultivated here will not be enough to
feed all these people.''
</P>
<P>
   Deng Deng, a farmer in his 30s, arrived in Panthou last weekend
with his stick-thin wife and two children. His youngest child died
of malnutrition a week earlier in their home region of Aguak, where
he said people are living on leaves and tamarind beans.
</P>
<P>
   Deng said he failed to plant a crop last year because raids by
Kerubino's forces forced him to a flee his home for several months.
Then in April, his cattle were stolen by Arab militias from the
north, who call themselves Public Defense Forces.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no grain, and I have no cows I can sell,'' he
explained, moving his hands with the slow-motion gestures of the
starving. ``I didn't plant last year because of Kerubino. I am here
because you are here, dropping food from the sky, feeding people.''
</P>
<P>
   It was Kerubino's decision in February to rejoin Garang's rebel
movement that touched off the latest fighting, and even though he
is now in the rebel camp, many people here trace the current crisis
to the incessant looting his faction perpetrated in 1997 when he
was fighting on the government's side.
</P>
<P>
   Several of the starving people who arrived in Wau on Tuesday
said they came from regions in northern Bahr el Ghazal that had
been raided first by Kerubino's forces, then by the Arab militias
this year. Some even accused Garang's forces of looting their
stores as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``Three months ago all my cattle were stolen by Arab militia
raiders,'' said Manyuat Akol, a 50 year old man from the Kowach
region who no longer had the strength to stand. ``All my seeds are
gone. The little I had to eat has been stolen by everyone,
including the rebel soldiers.''
</P>
<P>
   Nearby, Ajok Tong, a 38 year old woman from the village of
Lukluk, was grieving the deaths of two children she lost on the
walk to Wau.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is nothing to eat where we are,'' she said. ``People are
living on wild food. There has been no rain for us to cultivate. So
we came here for food, for survival.''

   NEW YORK _ AT&AMP;T Corp. announced quarterly earnings Thursday that

by AT&AMP;T's announcement that it would buy back up to $3 billion
worth of its stock. The repurchase plan is an attempt to reduce the
dilution of AT&AMP;T earnings that would be caused by the pending $31.8
billion acquisition of Tele-Communications Inc., the nation's No. 2
cable television company behind Time Warner Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Buoyed by the repurchase announcement, AT&AMP;T shares, the most
widely held in the nation, gained 93.75 cents, closing at $58.625
on the New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   But the long-term issue facing AT&AMP;T is how to grow at a rate
equal to that of the overall telecommunications industry. Though
AT&AMP;T remains the No. 1 long-distance phone carrier, it has lost
share in the long-distance market every year since 1984. In the
second quarter, revenue from its consumer long-distance business
declined by 3.7 percent from the comparable period of 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The company has made bids to expand into new areas, such as
local phone service, but those efforts have yet to generate much
revenue. Most analysts think that C. Michael Armstrong, who took
over as the company's chairman last fall, is making many of the
right moves. But even Armstrong says AT&AMP;T must accelerate its
revenue growth.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just not growing enough,'' he said Thursday in a
conference call with analysts.
</P>
<P>
   In the second quarter, AT&AMP;T sales were $12.86 billion, only 1.02
percent higher than the $12.73 billion reported during the
comparable period of last year.
</P>
<P>
   That growth represented an improvement from the first quarter,
when revenue grew by less than seven-tenths of a percent. But it
was still below the company's stated goal of increasing revenue
this year by 2 percent to 4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   With the revenue shortfall in the first half, AT&AMP;T will have to
increase its growth rate substantially over the second half to meet
that target. To record an annual growth rate of 3 percent, for
instance, the company would have to increase revenue for the second
half by about 5.1 percent over the $25.62 billion in sales the
company posted over the last half of 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have got to have double-digit growth in this industry,''
said Eric Strumingher, a telecommunications analyst for Paine
Webber. ``That's the real issue for this company to overcome.''
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T says it has consciously sacrificed revenue by moving valued
customers to optional calling plans that offer lower rates while
de-emphasizing less-profitable customers who make fewer calls.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have spent a lot of time working on improving the quality
of our revenue base so we have a base we can grow off of,'' Daniel
Somers, AT&AMP;T's chief financial officer, said in an interview,
adding that the process of moving customers to special plans would
be mostly complete by the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
   Somers estimates that the telecommunications industry is growing
at 8 percent a year and says AT&AMP;T intends to be growing at that
rate by the end of next year.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   A bright spot in the second quarter was AT&AMP;T's wireless
operation, which increased sales by 11.4 percent, to $1.24 billion.
A major factor that could propel revenue growth in the second half
of this year is AT&AMP;T's imposition of flat monthly fees on its
customers to help cover the cost of subsidizing communications
services in poor and rural areas and for schools and libraries.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the slow revenue growth, AT&AMP;T has been able to post
strong earnings gains by cutting costs. In the second quarter,
selling, general and administrative costs were 27.6 percent of
revenue, down from 30 percent in the comparable period of last
year. The reduction was caused partly by a program to cut the
number of employees. By the end of next year the company wants to
reduce that figure to 22 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Discounting one-time charges and gains, the company's continuing
operations (those that have not been sold) earned $1.49 billion, or
91 cents a diluted share, up 59.6 percent from 57 cents a share
during the second quarter of 1997. Analysts polled by First Call,
the financial research firm, had predicted a profit of 90 cents a
share.
</P>
<P>
   Including special charges and gains, the company earned $1.15
billion, or 71 cents a diluted share, up 20.3 percent from 59 cents
during the comparable period last year.
</P>
<P>
   Worldcom Inc., the No. 4 long-distance company, also released
quarterly financial results Thursday. It earned $220.9 million, or
21 cents a share, up from $47.38 million, or 4 cents a share,
during the comparable period last year.
</P>
<P>
   Worldcom revenue grew by 45.3 percent, to $2.61 billion from
$1.8 billion.

BOEING DROPS EARNINGS BOMB ON INVESTORS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By LAURENCE ZUCKERMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Boeing Co. stunned investors Thursday with news of a steep drop
in second-quarter earnings and an even more unexpected warning that
results for both this year and next will be about 40 percent below
Wall Street estimates.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement from the world's largest aerospace company
caused a 13 percent drop in Boeing's share price and was one of the
catalysts for a nearly 200-point decline in the Dow Jones
industrial average. Boeing shares, one of the Dow average's
component stocks, had been rallying in recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``They know how to build bombs,'' said Howard Rubel, an analyst
with Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co. in New York, ``and they delivered one
today.''
</P>
<P>
   Boeing's results and the guidance it offered for next year
helped convince investors that the company is not likely to cash in
on the current boom in commercial aircraft sales because of its
high costs and stiff price competition from Airbus Industrie, the
European consortium that is Boeing's main rival.
</P>
<P>
   For the quarter that ended June 30, earnings fell 46 percent to
$258 million, or 26 cents a diluted share, compared with $476
million, or 48 cents a diluted share, in the comparable period last
year. The average forecast for the quarter by analysts was 33 cents
a share, according to First Call Corp., which tracks corporate
earnings estimates.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing's revenue rose 9 percent to $13.4 billion from $12.3
billion in 1997. The company said it took a $78 million after-tax
charge during the quarter to account for costs related to its
previously announced decision to stop making the MD-11 jetliner and
for penalties paid to airlines because of late deliveries of the
new version of its single-aisle 737 jet.
</P>
<P>
   Investors reacted by dumping Boeing shares, which fell $6.5625,
to $41.1875, in New York Stock Exchange trading on volume that
exceeded 28 million shares. During the day the share price touched
$40.0625, a 52-week low.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing has been struggling to right itself since last fall, when
a surge in commercial airplane orders overwhelmed its assembly
lines. The production difficulties have forced the company to take
more than $3 billion in charges and delayed long-planned
productivity improvements aimed at cutting costs.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the costs of merging with McDonnell Douglas Corp.,
which it purchased for $16.3 billion last year, have proved to be
more than expected and the economic crisis in Asia has dampened the
demand for new airplanes from some of Boeing's best customers.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of these trials, Boeing's commercial airplane
division, which represents about 60 percent of overall revenue,
lost money in the first half of this year. The company predicted
that the division's profit margins would be between zero and 1
percent this year, rising to between 2 and 4 percent in 1999 _ far
lower than many analysts had expected.
</P>
<P>
   Philip Condit, chairman and chief executive of the Seattle-based
company, acknowledged that the company's performance has been weak.
But he said that he was determined to transform Boeing from a
company that focuses primarily on the performance of its products
to one that is ``financially driven.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   He outlined a series of ambitious goals, including raising
Boeing's annual return on sales to 7 percent from its current level
of 2 percent. The company also aims to save money by turning over
its inventory four times a year rather than just two.
</P>
<P>
   Given Boeing's recent performance, even the company's short-term
goals would appear beyond its grasp. Boeing plans to produce 620
planes next year, up from 546 in 1998. At the same time, it expects
to reduce overall employment by the end of next year to between
210,000 and 220,000 from 238,000 today.
</P>
<P>
   Condit admitted that consistently earning a 7 percent return on
sales would not be easy, though he said it could be achieved by
2,000. ``This is clearly a difficult goal,'' he told analysts.
``This is not one we have reached before. We have only come close
at the peak.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, there are already warning signs that assurances from
Condit earlier this month that Boeing's production difficulties
were finally under control may have been premature. On Thursday
Boeing said that expensive out-of-sequence work on its 747
production line had risen nearly 20 percent since July 1 and is
above the company's plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's worrying but it is not disastrous,'' said Harry
Stonecipher, Boeing's president.
</P>
<P>
   The situation in Asia also seems to be worsening. Boeing said it
currently has 20 completed airplanes in storage waiting for final
payment arrangements by Asian customers. Singapore Air said
Thursday that it was deferring delivery of one 747, eight 777s and
two Airbus A340s beyond 2000. Korean Air has also said that it will
probably defer some 747s and 777s scheduled for delivery next year.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Condit said that after seeing its cash reserves
drop to $3.5 billion this quarter from $5.1 billion at the end of
1997, Boeing expects to begin generating a lot of cash next year.
</P>
<P>
   Boyd Givan, the company's chief financial officer, said the
money might be used for a share repurchase plan. Whether that will
be enough to appease investors is unclear.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think they are particularly proud of what they handed
everybody today,'' Rubel said. ``At the same token, the hype is
gone. The pieces on the board have moved back to Go. They now have
to roll up their sleeves and work harder than they ever have
before.''

HOUSE VOTES TO OVERRIDE CLINTON VETO ON PARTIAL-BIRTH ABORTIONS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By GREG McDONALD 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The House voted Thursday to override President
Clinton's veto of a ban on so-called partial-birth abortions as
Republican leaders made good on an election-year promise to force
another legislative showdown on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   The vote, 296-132, was largely symbolic since even supporters of
the ban concede that they do not have enough support in the Senate
to override the veto there.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate is expected to take up the issue after it returns
from its Labor Day recess in September. But supporters of the ban
say they likely will fall at least three votes short of the 67
needed to repeat the House action.
</P>
<P>
   The House vote, which marked the second time in two years that
the Republican-controlled chamber had voted to override a Clinton
veto of the ban, energized anti-abortion forces and turned up the
pressure on the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Randy Tate, executive director of the Christian Coalition, said
his organization would begin lobbying senators hard to ``reaffirm
our most fundamental right as Americans _ the right to life.''
</P>
<P>
   In a May meeting with leaders of the religious right, who had
threatened to withhold their support in the fall elections,
Republican House leaders promised to put the abortion issue ``front
and center'' on their agenda for the rest of the year. They
delivered on that promise in the abortion debate, as Republican
supporters of the ban painted in highly emotional and graphic terms
why they feel the late-term abortion procedure, where a fetus is
partly delivered feet first and then aborted with an incision to
the base of the skull, should be outlawed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's vote today to defend those little babies who cannot
defend themselves,'' said Rep. Steve Chabot, R-Ohio, who called the
procedure, known medically as intact dilation and extraction, ''a
violent and gruesome act`` that involves the ``killing of a baby
just seconds before it takes its first breath outside the womb.''
</P>
<P>
   House Judiciary Committee Chairman Henry Hyde, R-Ill., went
further, labeling it ``infanticide.'' He called the procedure an
example of the nation's moral decay and said those who perform or
view it as an acceptable medical procedure must have ``a heart of
stone and soul of ice.''.
</P>
<P>
   ``A vote against this motion (to override the veto) is to
legitimize an ... unspeakable cruelty,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of the ban, however, questioned the timing of the motion
to override and accused Republicans of playing politics with the
lives and health of women. They said the decisions about late-term
or any other kinds of abortion procedures should be left to women
and their physicians.
</P>
<P>
   ``This legislation puts the lives of women at risk and it
tramples on the constitutional right of every woman in this
nation,'' said Rep. Nita Lowey, D-N.Y., adding that Congress should
not interfere in such a ``personal decision.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people realize this is something you do not go lightly
into,'' said Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee, D-Texas, adding that the
procedure is used rarely and to help save the life or protect the
health of the mother.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we are arguing for is the right of the woman, with her
doctor, her God and her family, to choose what is best for her,''
Jackson Lee said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think any of us support this procedure,'' said Rep.
Ken Bentsen, D-Texas. But he agreed that it was sometimes necessary
to protect a woman's health.
</P>
<P>
   Bentsen called the Republican attempt to criminalize the
procedure an election-year ploy aimed at appeasing the religious
right at the expense of women faced with painful and difficult
decisions.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what this is about. It is not about the health of
women. This is politics pure and simple and it is about as indecent
as this House can get,'' Bentsen said.
</P>
<P>
   The bill banning partial-birth abortions, vetoed for the second
time by Clinton last October, addresses only one specific medical
procedure and makes no exception for the life or health of the
mother. But it does not prohibit other forms of late-term
abortions.
</P>
<P>
   Some lawmakers have introduced a bipartisan alternative bill
that would prohibit all late-term abortions, except in cases where
the life or health of the woman is at risk. But the Republican
leadership has so far refused to allow a vote on that measure.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton has said that he would sign a bill prohibiting
all late-term abortions if it allows exemptions to protect the
health of the woman. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   Figuring that well-heeled Americans would like a truck with
limousine pretensions, Lincoln Mercury is considering whether to
offer the ultimate pickup.
</P>
<P>
   Informally called the Blackwood, the truck might be based on the
big Ford Super Duty. It would combine the opulence of the Navigator
sport utility with myriad luxury features and genuine wood in the
pickup bed. It would sell for $40,000 to $50,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``We won't rule out anything,'' a Ford product development
executive said.
</P>
<P>
   Strong demand for Navigators has emboldened Ford's truck
developers. An even larger sport utility, the Excursion, will take
on General Motors' Suburban next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We reap substantial benefits by doing the unexpected,'' the
executive said. ``Even wilder ideas are under consideration.'' &QL;

MICROSOFT ATTACKED BY SEN. HATCH AND RIVAL COMPANIES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (EDs: FILED also in ``w'' and ``f'' categories)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARK HELM  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Software giant Microsoft came under attack again
Thursday from a leading senator and from executives of rival
companies, who called the firm a monopoly that threatens innovation
in the computer industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``The critical debate, many believe, is the extent to which
Microsoft is exploiting its current monopolies both to kill off
potential threats, and to leverage these monopolies to control new
technologies which will define the future of computing, of the
Internet and of how we conduct much of our daily lives,'' said Sen.
Orrin Hatch, R-Utah.
</P>
<P>
   Hatch, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, which was
holding its second hearing into Microsoft's business practices,
said the Redmond, Wash., company ``certainly appeared to have
engaged in anti-competitive behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   At a previous hearing in March, billionaire Microsoft Chairman
Bill Gates defended his company's actions as those of an
``aggressive'' firm. However, at Wednesday's hearing, neither Gates
nor any other Microsoft official testified before the committee.
</P>
<P>
   Hatch said he had asked Microsoft officials to come to the
hearing, but they declined. He added that some other companies
asked to testify on Microsoft's behalf had turned down the offer.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact is that our doors have not exactly been knocked down
with companies asking to defend Microsoft's business practices,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft, which is fighting an antitrust lawsuit by the Justice
Department and 20 states, said it would be inappropriate to appear
since the trial in that case is scheduled for September.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not clear that additional testimony from Microsoft will
serve any purpose,'' the company said in a statement, which noted
Hatch's frequent attacks.
</P>
<P>
   However, outside the hearing room, Microsoft did receive support
from Sen. Slade Gordon, R-Wash., who held a press conference only
minutes before the hearing started.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is nothing but another show for unsuccessful competitors
to make their complaints against one of America's most successful
companies,'' he said, adding that the hearing was ``another chapter
in Sen. Hatch's vendetta against Microsoft.''
</P>
<P>
   But inside the hearing room, heads of rival companies painted a
totally different picture of Microsoft and Gates.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Glasser, chairman of Seattle-based RealNetworks, which
makes software that allows people to watch video across the
Internet, said Microsoft was attempting to undermine his product.
</P>
<P>
   Glasser, who worked for Microsoft for 10 years and said he was a
friend of Gates, charged that Microsoft's version of the video
software, known as Windows Media Player, blocks consumers from
using his product.
</P>
<P>
   To prove his point, Glasser entered a site on the World Wide Web
and played a news video, which used his software product. Glasser
then downloaded Windows Media Player and re-entered the same Web
site. The video failed to play.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft, in a statement released responding to Glasser's
testimony, said the company ``does NOT disable'' the RealNetworks'
product.
</P>
<P>
   After Glasser testified, Sen. Robert Torricelli, D-N.J., read an
affidavit from a Microsoft official that accused the RealNetworks
chief of seeking to use his appearance before the committee as
leverage to force Microsoft to make a deal with his company.
</P>
<P>
   In the affidavit, Paul Maritz, a Microsoft vice president, said
that on Wednesday Glass offered to withdraw as a witness if
Microsoft would accept a new licensing agreement with RealNetworks.
Its current licensing agreement with Microsoft expired Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   While acknowledging that he spoke with Microsoft officials on
Wednesday, Glasser said it was only to brief them on what he was
going to say at the hearing. He called the claim that he tried to
force them into a deal ``completely untrue.''
</P>
<P>
   Another Gates' rival, Lawrence J. Ellison, chairman of Oracle
Corp., based in Redwood Shores, Calif., told the committee that
Microsoft would never be satisfied with only part of the software
market.
</P>
<P>
   ``Microsoft is already the most powerful company in the world,
and you ain't seen nothing yet,'' said the Ellison, whose company
is the world's second-largest independent software company.
</P>
<P>
   He said Microsoft was using the dominance of its Window's
operating system _ the program is installed in 95 percent of new
computers _ to stifle competition and take over other software
markets.
</P>
<P>
   Ellison said Microsoft's response to the success of Netscape
Corp.'s Navigator, the Mountain View, Calif., company's Internet
browser, has been typical of what he called Microsoft's
``predatory'' business practices.
</P>
<P>
   He said that when Netscape Navigator emerged as a key portal to
the World Wide Web, Microsoft quickly copied the technology and
introduced its own browser, called Internet Explorer. Microsoft
then added, or ``bundled,'' Internet Explorer to the company's
Windows program. The result is that people who buy a new computer
with Windows already installed no longer need Netscape Navigator.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Microsoft's share of the Internet browser market has
increased steadily for the last year, and the company now has
nearly 50 percent of the market. Netscape Navigator's share of the
market has fallen from around 80 percent to less than 50 percent in
that time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bill wants to add everything to Windows,'' Ellison said. ``And
every time he succeeds, that's the end of innovation in that
product.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Last month, a federal appeals court overturned a U.S. District
Court injunction that had prohibited Microsoft from requiring
computer manufacturers to install Microsoft's browser software for
navigating the World Wide Web as a condition of installing Windows
95.
</P>
<P>
   The appeals court said Microsoft had the right to add whatever
new features it wanted to its operating system, even if that
included ``bundling'' other products, as long as the result
benefits consumers.
</P>
<P>
   The appeals court's ruling came as blow to 20 state attorneys
general and Department of Justice officials, who have alleged in a
lawsuit that Microsoft is illegally tying its Windows 98 software
with its Internet Explorer browser.
</P>
<P>
   They argue that Microsoft is using its dominance of the
operating systems market to gain control of the Internet software
industry. By placing Internet Explorer on Windows 98, the updated
version of Windows 95, and excluding other browsers, they contend,
Microsoft stifles innovation and competition.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft officials argue that integrating the Internet browser
into Windows benefits users. They also say that the Internet has
become such a fundamental part of computer use that access to it
should be part of the any operating system.
</P>
<P>
   A browser is software that allows users to access information on
the Internet's World Wide Web, which offers text, pictures and
sound.

REUTERS GROUP ACQUIRES LIPPER ANALYTICAL SERVICES 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   Reuters Group PLC announced Thursday that it had acquired Lipper
Analytical Services Inc., the mutual fund data company, for an
undisclosed cash amount.
</P>
<P>
   Lipper, founded in 1973, pioneered the business of providing
detailed performance information on individual mutual funds and
groups of funds with similar investment objectives. But more
recently it has lagged behind competitors like Morningstar Inc. in
marketing those data to the brokers and investment advisers who are
the biggest sellers of mutual funds to individual investors.
</P>
<P>
   In joining Reuters, Lipper will gain access to the capital
required to update its technology and broaden its distribution,
said Simon Thompson, currently marketing director for Reuters
Europe, Middle East and Africa, who will take over as chief
executive of Lipper Analytical. A. Michael Lipper, the founder and
chairman of Lipper Analytical, will serve as chairman of the new
Reuters unit.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have the technological strength and financial resources to
take Lipper forward in the larger global world of funds that is
emerging,'' Thompson said. ``We also have ways of reaching users
within the fund companies and, more importantly perhaps, private
investors at home, in effective and attractive ways that simply
were not possible before.''
</P>
<P>
   Reuters has extensive distribution capabilities, an ability
absent at Lipper, whose data are available primarily in printed
form or electronically over a dedicated computer terminal. Much
more popular with brokers and financial advisers are products like
Morningstar's Principia, a CD-ROM containing historical data and
analysis on several thousand funds.
</P>
<P>
   Lipper will devote about half his time to Lipper Analytical,
which is based in Summit, N.J., and has 300 employees worldwide.
The remainder of Lipper's time will go to three formerly affiliated
businesses _ a consulting service, a registered investment adviser
and a broker-dealer _ which were not purchased by Reuters.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson said that Lipper would be the cornerstone of the
Reuters global fund-data business, which includes three recent
European acquisitions: HSW, which provides performance data on
funds and investment trusts marketed in the United Kingdom; Bopp,
which provides similar data on Swiss and German investment funds,
and Citywatch, which distributes ownership information on shares of
publicly traded British companies.
</P>
<P>
   Reuters also recently signed a letter of intent to purchase the
investment trust data business of BT Alex. Brown. Investment trusts
are a British equivalent of mutual funds.

NASA TO HOLD MEMORIAL FOR SHEPARD

<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ A memorial service for Mercury astronaut Alan B.
Shepard Jr, who died earlier this week, is planned for Aug. 1 in
Houston, NASA said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The service at NASA's Johnson Space Center will be limited to
members of Shepard's family, invited dignitaries and space agency
employees.
</P>
<P>
   However, the memorial will be televised on NASA-TV, said space
agency spokesman Rob Navias. Other details of the memorial still
were being planned Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Shepard, 74, died late Tuesday, following a lengthy illness at a
California hospital near his home in Pebble Beach, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   On May 5, 1961, Shepard became the first American in space. A
decade later on his second and final trip into space, Shepard
became one of only a dozen humans to walk on the moon.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a spokesman for Shepard's wife, Louise, said funeral
services for the astronaut will be private.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be private, with family only. As to the date and the
place, those plans will not be made public,'' said spokesman Howard
Benedict, who serves as the executive director of the Astronaut
Scholarship Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   The foundation was founded by Shepard and the other Mercury
astronauts, or their surviving family members, to assist college
students interested in science and engineering careers.
</P>
<P>
   The Shephard family has requested that in lieu of flowers
donations be made to the foundation. The organization is
headquartered at 6225 Vectorspace Boulevard, Titusville, Fla.,
32780.

COMMENTARY: MESSAGES FROM THE MISSILE 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also IRAN and IRAN-U.S.) 
(bl) 
 By A.M. ROSENTHAL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The missile launched by Iran on Wednesday had a payload of
messages to nations around the world _ other Muslim nations of the
Middle East, Israel, Europe, the United States _ and to the Iranian
people.
</P>
<P>
   Among the messages was the military intelligence coming from the
launch.
</P>
<P>
   The range was 800 to 900 miles. Almost every Middle Eastern
country is now within reach of the missiles that Iran manufactured
from components bought abroad. And so now are all U.S. forces in
the Mideast, or ever likely to be.
</P>
<P>
   The missile was reported in the West as sold by North Korea,
China's dependency. But before the test launch, Israeli
intelligence knew, and has told the West, that components from
Russia were also in the missile. It was sent off from a mobile
launcher, hard to spot, harder to destroy.
</P>
<P>
   Washington says it will keep trying to prevent missile parts and
technology from reaching Iran. Dandy. But America and its European
partners have not even been able to stop Bulgaria, Cuba, China and
other countries from supplying weapons to Ethiopia and Eritrea, now
at war again. Compared with the allure of the buying power and
world-roving salesmen of Iran, the Africans are a penny-candy
machine.
</P>
<P>
   The West estimates that Iran needs at least five more years to
produce missiles that could reach Europe with chemical and
bacteriological weapons. Unfortunately Iran, Iraq, North Korea and
similar political garden spots have a way of suddenly jumping up
and saying ``Look what we have!'' while the democracies are still
staring at the mirage of a safety gap.
</P>
<P>
   Each recipient of a message from the missile will react in its
own way. The Saudis did not really need the warning. They have
moved from being a prime Iranian target to attending an Islamic
conference in Iran. As they dine at parties in the Saudi Embassy in
Washington, American guests might remember that their hosts refuse
to give the United States information that would link Iran to the
murder of U.S. soldiers in their apartment building in Saudi
Arabia.
</P>
<P>
   Israel got the small compensation of confirmation of years of
warning about Iranian plans for missiles with far greater range
than the stockpile of Iran's Scuds.
</P>
<P>
   The nightmare of Israelis opposing a Palestinian state is that
such a state will open itself to Muslim troops or terrorists from
other countries, particularly Iran.
</P>
<P>
   The missile launch will strengthen Israelis who believe that for
that reason alone Israel should not agree to a Palestinian state _
not even if the rest of the world recognizes it.
</P>
<P>
   So the missile could make Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's
life even more difficult and peace harder to reach _ both the
passionate intent of the ayatollah government that rules Iran.
</P>
<P>
   To Iranians, the missile carried the plain message that those
ayatollahs were the rulers of Iran, not the comparatively moderate
elected president, Mohammad Khatami.
</P>
<P>
   Khatami and Washington have put out tentative feelers about
Iranian-U.S. talks. But to hold them he would need approval of the
ayatollahs, who run the police, armed forces and missile
production. They also decide on such matters as the number of
lashes and years in prison that were the sentence Thursday of the
former mayor of Tehran, a supporter of Khatami.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright has said the United States
has certain thoughts about U.S.-Iranian relations, which seem to
amount to conditions for talks _ particularly the end of Iran's
role as chief terrorist against America, Israel, Germany, Turkey,
Argentine Jews and other targets that make the ayatollahs salivate.
Khatami's foreign minister said that was Cold War talk.
</P>
<P>
   Natan Sharansky, the former Soviet political prisoner who is now
an Israeli Cabinet member, says the Soviet empire was kept alive an
extra 20 years by the power of fear and appearance of might that
came with its missiles and warheads.
</P>
<P>
   Iran's ayatollahs rule by terror at home and terror exported.
They count on terror to extend their reign a lot more than 20
years. Their end will come not by suicide _ the voluntary surrender
of terrorist power by bomb, lash or missile. The end will come when
the Iranian people overthrow them.
</P>
<P>
   They did not intend it, but that was the most important message
sent by the ayatollahs, on that missile.

STRIKE IN RUSSIAN NUCLEAR CENTER SIGN OF GROWING LABOR UNREST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID FILIPOV  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ At first glance, Thursday's brief strike by several
thousand workers in the provincial town of Sarov was nothing
special, not in a country where millions of workers are
increasingly fed up with going months without pay.
</P>
<P>
   But Sarov, better known by its Cold War-era code name,
Arzamas-16, is a special place. The ultra-secret nuclear research
center where the Soviets developed their first atomic bombs is
still the home of Russia's elite nuclear scientists. Virtually
closed off from the rest of the world by troops and barbed wire,
Russia's best and brightest toil for $175 a month to upgrade their
country's huge nuclear weapons arsenal.
</P>
<P>
   Like Russian workers everywhere, the people of Sarov receive
their paychecks sporadically, and rarely in full. Morale is low,
and scientists in Sarov say safety standards are suffering, a
chilling thought in a town studded with nuclear reactors.
Thursday's work stoppage and protest by some 3,500 of the
scientists is the latest sign of growing unrest in Russia.
</P>
<P>
   The protest also highlighted some of the challenges facing Vice
President Al Gore, who arrived in Moscow Thursday for talks with
President Boris Yeltsin and Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko that
are aimed in part at setting up a visit to Moscow by President
Clinton in September. Gore may also speak by phone with President
Boris Yeltsin, who is on a fishing vacation in northwest Russia.
</P>
<P>
   One of Gore's tasks is to try to convince Russia to speed up
ratification of the Start II nuclear arms reduction treaty which
would reduce both countries' nuclear arsenals from 6,000 each to
3,500 by the year 2007. Signed in 1993 and ratified by the US
Senate in 1996, Start II has all but died in the Russian
parliament, straining US-Russian relations and putting a hold on
further arms reductions talks. Yeltsin has promised in the past to
help get Start II ratified, but has failed.
</P>
<P>
   Russian legislators say they oppose Start II partly because of
lack of funding to destroy the weapons. There is no more graphic
symbol of the cash crunch than striking workers at Russia's Los
Alamos.
</P>
<P>
   Gore is also the highest-ranking US official to meet with
Kiriyenko since Yeltsin named the obscure 35-year-old prime
minister in a surprise Cabinet shakeup this spring. Gore will be
keen to see how the new government is using the time bought for it
by a $22.6 billion rescue package Russia won this month from the
International Monetary Fund and other world lenders.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration strongly supported the massive
bailout on the condition that Moscow put its shaky finances in
order by cutting spending and improving tax collection. But a
growing number of Western economists question the wisdom of
financially propping up a Kremlin that has fostered a small class
of fabulously wealthy Russian businessmen who keep their fortunes
in foreign bank accounts, but has been unable in six years to move
ahead with urgent restructuring of industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the real money that enters the system (under the new
loan) will end up abroad again,'' commented Robert McIntyre, who
heads an economic research project in Russia sponsored by the
University of Massachusetts at Amherst. ``There is no evidence of
any serious measures to deal with the real economy problems.''
</P>
<P>
   The austerity plan drawn up by the Kiriyenko government to meet
the loan's conditions faces heavy resistance from legislators, who
say Russians in places like Sarov have already put up with enough
pain.
</P>
<P>
   (In an apparent effort to win support from opposition lawmakers,
Yeltsin Thursday named a senior Communist legislator, Yury
Maslyukov, minister of trade.)
</P>
<P>
   Poor morale at Sarov also points to the possibility that Russian
scientists might defect to other countries who can pay more for
their nuclear expertise. In particular, the US is concerned about
nine Russian defense industry companies it suspects of aiding Iran
in that country's quest to build nuclear missiles. The Russian
government says it is investigating.
</P>
<P>
   To help prevent nuclear brain drain, Russian officials said on
Thursday they expected Gore and Kiriyenko to sign a cooperation
accord on joint projects to support Russia's closed nuclear
research cities like Sarov.
</P>
<P>
   Officials are also expected to address a disagreement over an
existing deal under which the United States buys treated uranium
removed from decommissioned Russian nuclear warheads.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Thursday, Gore visited the Chernobyl nuclear reactor in
Ukraine, site of the world's worst nuclear accident in 1986. After
touring the still-active plant and the ghost town of Pripyat
nearby, Gore called Chernobyl ``a menacing monument to mistakes of
the century'' and said it was time for the world to learn from the
disaster.

BRAZIL, ARGENTINA FAIL TO COMPLETE AUTO-TRADE PACT 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By CLIFFORD KRAUSS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   USHUAIA, Argentina _ In a potentially serious blow to the $15
billion auto industry in South America, Argentine and Brazilian
officials have failed to complete a long-awaited agreement for
common car tariffs that auto executives had hoped would be ready
for signing at a regional economic summit meeting that opened here
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Officials of the two countries said they might still be able to
draw up a common auto trade policy by the end of the year, but
independent analysts said presidential campaign politics in the two
countries could stall progress until the end of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   South American automobile executives expressed concern that
companies including Volkswagen and Daimler-Benz might delay planned
investments valued at more than $500 million until Argentina and
Brazil ironed out their trade differences.
</P>
<P>
   Argentina and Brazil, the two dominant countries in a
four-nation South American common market called Mercosur, have come
to a preliminary agreement that would set a tariff of 35 percent on
cars produced outside the region. It would have gone into force in
2000. The tariff would represent a slight increase from the 33
percent tariff now levied by Argentina but a significant decrease
from the 45 percent rate of Brazil, by far the largest market in
South America.
</P>
<P>
   The two countries would allow companies that currently have
production plants in the region _ including Ford, General Motors,
Volkswagen and Fiat _ to import cars from elsewhere at a rate of
17.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Brazil and Argentina have also agreed to drop all tariffs in
2000 for cars and parts produced in the Mercosur countries, which
also include Uruguay and Paraguay.
</P>
<P>
   But two major stumbling blocks remain before any agreement can
be signed, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Argentina has called for Brazil to drop all subsidies granted to
the local car industry by Brazilian state governments. Brazil has
said that under its federal system, it cannot easily void
agreements made by the states to attract companies to build plants
in their jurisdictions.
</P>
<P>
   The four Mercosur countries have also not agreed on a formula by
which each country would be assured of producing components for
autos assembled in the region.
</P>
<P>
   Brazil, which has the most advanced car industry of the four,
opposes any national content requirement as long as 60 percent of
the components of cars receiving Mercosur free trade benefits are
produced in any one of the four countries.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Botafogo Goncalves, Brazil's minister of industry, told
reporters this week that the four presidents would sign a
declaration at their meeting here listing general concepts they
agreed on for a future auto tariff agreement. But he added that any
elimination of local subsidies as demanded by Argentina would be
``juridically speaking, impossible.''
</P>
<P>
   Several analysts expressed skepticism that any significant
progress on an auto agreement would be reached over the next two
days here in Ushuaia, the world's southernmost town, in the Tierra
del Fuego region.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mercosur is not moving as fast as it did in the early 1990s,''
said Ricardo Lopez Murphy, chief economist at the FIEL-Latin
American Economic Research Foundation, an Argentine center. ``The
reform process is stagnant.''
</P>
<P>
   The impasse comes at a time when higher interest rates and
declining economic growth have slowed what had been years of
booming car production and sales in Argentina and Brazil.
Manufacturers have estimated that car sales in Brazil this year
will fall below 1.8 million, a 10 percent decline from 1997 levels.
</P>
<P>
   The drop-off in sales has forced several temporary plant
closings in Brazil, although both Ford and General Motors are
building new assembly plants in the southern state of Rio Grande do
Sul.

10 `ALLY MCBEAL' NOMINATIONS CHEER WRITER KELLEY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Fixes Jane Seymour)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DON AUCOIN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; More than surprise, more than jubilation, ``Ally McBeal''
creator David E. Kelley felt a bone-deep sense of relief Thursday
when he learned that his Boston-based TV series had won 10 Emmy
Award nominations in the best comedy category.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone, you see, has gotten the joke.
</P>
<P>
   Whether she is pursuing her law career, her romances, or that
elusive Dancing Baby, Ally McBeal exists in a state of comic
dither. The punditocracy has responded to the miniskirted fidgeter
with a resounding harrumph; just last month Time magazine ran a
photo of the star of ``Ally McBeal'' above this portentous inquiry:
``Is Feminism Dead?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of me was probably desperate for it to be declared a
comedy,'' Kelley said in an interview with the Globe. ``We get so
many letters that take episodes to heart: `How dare you do this or
that?' ''
</P>
<P>
   ``Our response is usually: `The show is a comedy. Don't take us
too seriously,' '' he added. ``Now that the Emmys have declared us
a comedy, maybe everyone will get the message that we're not
speaking for society; we're speaking for Ally.''
</P>
<P>
   NBC led the Emmy-nomination parade with 86, including 11 for
``Frasier,'' the top-nominated comedy. Next was HBO with 72
nominations, including an Emmy-leading 17 for Tom Hanks' 12-part
miniseries on the space program, ``From the Earth to the Moon.'' In
third place was ABC with 54, including, ironically enough,
nominations for the canceled ``Ellen'' and its star, Ellen
DeGeneres. Fourth was CBS with 36, followed by Fox, with 35 _
including the 10 nominations for ``Ally McBeal'' _ and TNT with 18.
</P>
<P>
   The cascade of Emmy nominations capped a remarkable year for the
protean, 40-year-old Kelley, a 1983 graduate of Boston University
Law School who practiced law in Boston before heading to Hollywood,
where he married actress Michelle Pfeiffer five years ago.
</P>
<P>
   In a feat that astonished many in the television industry,
Kelley wrote all 22 episodes of ``Ally McBeal'' last year as well
as most of the 22 episodes of ABC's ``The Practice,'' a
Boston-based legal drama he created that also was nominated in the
best drama series category.
</P>
<P>
   While ``Ally McBeal'' became the first hourlong show in three
decades to be nominated as a comedy, Kelley admitted that the
nomination of ``The Practice,'' a show that he said had been ``kind
of forsaken,'' was perhaps most gratifying of all.
</P>
<P>
   ``A year ago `The Practice' was on Saturday night, and ABC's
statement to the contrary notwithstanding, they put it there to
die,'' he said. ``Now, here we are a year later with a good time
slot on Monday nights and an Emmy nomination.''
</P>
<P>
   Hanks, who left television 15 years ago to become a movie star
after the forgettable ``Bosom Buddies'' was canceled, climaxed his
triumphant return to the medium with a harvest of nominations for
``From the Earth to the Moon,'' a miniseries for which he served as
executive producer (he also acted in one part and directed
another).
</P>
<P>
   In awarding more nominations to ``From the Earth to the Moon''
than to any other show or series, the Academy of Television Arts &AMP;
Sciences delivered a stinging rebuff to the broadcast networks. The
networks had protested the submission of ``From the Earth'' into
the miniseries category, arguing that it was too long to be so
considered.
</P>
<P>
   It was the latest and most bitter chapter in a long-running
battle between broadcasters and the cable networks over whether
cable outlets enjoy an unfair advantage in the miniseries
competition because they can devote more time and money to a few
big projects per year, while broadcast networks must program 22
prime-time hours per week.
</P>
<P>
   In another sign of the inroads cable has made into the dominance
of broadcast networks, 15 cable networks received a total of 139
Emmy nominations, the most ever for cable programming.
</P>
<P>
   The pace-setting showing by ``Frasier'' will hearten programmers
at the Peacock Network who recently anointed the urbane sitcom as
the Thursday-night successor to ``Seinfeld'' this fall. The
most-nominated dramas were NBC's ``ER'' and Fox's ``The X-Files,''
tied at 16 nominations apiece.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Kelley, Hanks, and ``Frasier,'' Emmy smiled upon
numerous actors and TV shows that will no longer be on the air when
the winners of the 50th Annual Primetime Emmy Awards are announced
on Sept. 13.
</P>
<P>
   Phil Hartman, slain by his wife in May in a murder-suicide, was
nominated as best supporting actor for his role in NBC's
``NewsRadio.''
</P>
<P>
   Numerous stars and shows that won't be returning were also
nominated: NBC's ``Seinfeld'' (though series creator and star Jerry
Seinfeld was snubbed); HBO's ``The Larry Sanders Show'' and its
star, Garry Shandling; ABC's canceled ``Ellen'' and its star, Ellen
DeGeneres; Jane Seymour of ``Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman'', which CBS
canceled over Seymour's vehement objection; Andre Braugher of NBC's
``Homicide''; and Jimmy Smits of ABC's ``NYPD Blue,'' who will
leave after a few more episodes.
</P>
<P>
   As for David E. Kelley, he is staying right where he is, with
his nose to the most creative grindstone in television today.
</P>
<P>
   Observing that ``Ally McBeal'' is ``kind of a different
animal,'' he said he intends to write most episodes of the show for
the upcoming season, though he said he may delegate some of ``The
Practice'' scriptwriting chores.
</P>
<P>
   Kelley freely acknowledged that ``Ally McBeal'' does not contain
as much Boston flavor as ``The Practice.'' He said he set ``Ally''
in Boston for ``economic reasons,'' noting that it was more
efficient for his production company in gathering courtroom
exteriors and other scene-setting shots.
</P>
<P>
   According to TV historian Alex McNeil, ``Ally McBeal'' is the
first hourlong show since ``Love, American Style'' in 1969-70 to be
nominated as best comedy series. (``Love, American Style'' later
switched to a half-hour).
</P>
<P>

Style in his own inimitable fashion, regardless of brickbats from
the humor-impaired.

   ``We were really braced for that reaction right away,'' he said.
``Even during the development of the pilot, I said `You do realize
this will be ripe for attack, because there will be people out
there who will say how dare you create this character who's smart
and has a degree of sophistication and success and yet somehow
declares herself empty because she doesn't have a man' '' and is
otherwise willing to admit confusion in her life.

<P>
   Kelley himself was feeling anything but empty as the Emmy news
rolled in.

   ``When you're in production, you can't take too many moments,''
he said, adding jokingly. ``I vicariously take a moment through
Peter MacNicol's character on `Ally' (`the Biscuit'). But I'd be
lying if I didn't say we're all thrilled today.''

FARM KIDS (Undated) - A 4-year-old and 11 other children under 12
were found picking onions on Maricopa County, Ariz., farms during
surprise visits by federal Department of Labor investigators in
May. Last week, three growers and three farm labor contractors were
fined nearly $20,000 for violating child labor laws. Nationwide,
this is a hidden but common practice on commercial farms. The
Arizona sweeps were part of federal crackdown on use of child
farmworkers. So far this year, 50 young children have been found
working on farms in Texas, New Mexico and Louisiana in addition to
those in Arizona. By GRACIELA SEVILLA. Story will move in the ``A''
category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
VISAS (Washington) - The Senate agreed Thursday to delay for five
years a planned ``laser-card visa'' that Arizona officials feared
would stifle trade by making it too costly for Mexican shoppers to
cross the border. The new agreement also would waive the $45 cost
of the card for children under 15. Arizona border towns are
relieved. By JEFF BARKER. Story will move in the ``A'' category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
SYMINGTON-VACATION (Phoenix) - Former Gov. Fife Symington,
convicted of bank and wire fraud, wants to spend a leisurely
Christmas vacation in Honduras. Fedearl prosecutors stand in his
way, telling a federal judge in briefs filed Thursday that
Symington does not deserve to have his passport restored. By PAT
FLANNERY. Story will move in the ``A'' category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
DEATH AWARD (Undated) - A jury returned an $8 million verdict
Thursday against Southwest Gas Co. in the death of an 11-year-old
boy who was was killed by a drunk driver in a Rolls Royce on a
Scottsdale, Ariz., street. Southwest Gas failed to take precautions
for pedestrians when it ripped up a street to do some work.
Christopher ``Kip'' Turner and his dad, Ted, were forced to walk in
the road to get around the construction site, which ultimately cost
the boy his life, attorneys for Kip parents argued. His parents,
Ted Turner and Deborah Luck, were each awarded $4 million in the
verdict. By VICKY HARKER. Story will move in the ``A'' category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
CAR DEALERS (Undated) - Arizona dealers in General Motors cars and
trucks find supplies on vehicles and mostly parts getting tight,
though it's not as bad in Arizona as it is in some other parts of
the country. The hot-selling Suburbans and Yukons are gone, in some
cases, and customers' cars are stacking up waiting for parts. Worse
is the public perception that dealers are out of cars entirely or
trying to gouge customers for scarce vehicles, resulting in empty
showrooms and and lax sales for July. Reskedded from Wednesday. By
BOB GOLFEN. Story will move in the ``F`` category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
GENRICH-COLUMN (Undated) - Studies show that children who have been
in day careare likely to suffer a series of health maladies. But
now comes a theory that attendance at day care contributes to
children misbehaving badly. By MARK GENRICH.Story will move in the
`K` category. &QL;

 THE EX GAMES  
 By WILLIAM SALETAN 
 (www.slate.com) 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   This month a coalition of conservative Christian groups placed
ads in national newspapers arguing that gays could be ``healed'' of
their homosexuality through religious therapy. ``We're standing for
the truth that homosexuals can change,'' said one ad. ``I'm living
proof that Truth can set you free,'' said another, which featured a
self-described former lesbian. The ads quoted Senate Majority
Leader Trent Lott, who recently likened homosexuality to alcoholism
and kleptomania.
</P>
<P>
   The media and gay rights groups pounced on the ads, treating
them as a religious-right ploy to raise money and rouse the
anti-gay rabble for the 1998 elections. They also suggested the ads
were simply false. On ``This Week,'' Sam Donaldson compared the
proposition that ``homosexuals can change'' to the proposition that
``the world is flat.'' On ``Face the Nation,'' Elizabeth Birch,
executive director of the Human Rights Campaign, a gay rights
group, said, ``I resent these ads because they present gay and
lesbian Americans as damaged goods.''
</P>
<P>
   Both critiques miss the point. Start with the accusation that
the ads are just a fund-raising scheme for anti-gay groups.
Contrary to this naive cynicism, the shrewdness of the ads isn't in
their motive. It's in their message: not that gays are wicked but
that they should be taken seriously when they choose to redefine
themselves. This marks a strategic inflection point in the debate
over gay rights. The basis for judging the propriety of a person's
sexual orientation is shifting from an intuitive, objective
standard (orthodoxy) to an empirical, subjective standard
(happiness). This puts the anti-gay movement on firmer footing for
now but, as we will see, it comes at a price.
</P>
<P>
   It's equally naive to dismiss the ex-gay movement as a total
fraud. As Bill Kristol succinctly put it on ``This Week,'' ``These
people exist.'' On ``Face the Nation,'' anti-gay activist Gary
Bauer explained: ``I have met hundreds of people who were in that
lifestyle and are now out and are married, have children, and are
living happy lives as married couples. How do we argue with that?''
Indeed, many of us are indirectly if not directly familiar with the
proverbial college lesbian who has since married a male investment
banker and has two kids. Maybe she's really a lesbian, maybe she's
not. But who are we to say?
</P>
<P>
   Instead of denying the ex-gay movement, gay rights advocates
would be wiser to embrace the paradigm shift it represents.
Consider the analogy of ``post-abortion syndrome.'' Years ago,
pro-lifers began to organize and promote groups of women who
regretted their abortions and had decided never to repeat the
experience. Rather than dismiss those women, abortion rights
advocates learned to embrace and recast them as exemplars of
choice. These women had every right to choose not to have
abortions, the pro-choicers conceded. But by the same token, other
women should have the right to choose the opposite.
</P>
<P>
   The ex-gay movement presents a similar opportunity. ``Gays came
out of the closet 25 years ago,'' Kristol observed. ``Now
ex-gays--I don't know how many, there clearly are hundreds, maybe a
few thousand--are coming out of the closet and saying, 'In every
case at least, homosexuality is not genetically ingrained.' They
have a right to say this.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed they do. But this principle, newly embraced by the right,
goes both ways: It's OK to be yourself, and it's not OK for someone
else to deny your experience and your choice. On ``This Week,''
Clarence Page reported that one of the activists who had funded the
ex-gay ads ``said he doubts that two-thirds of those who have
changed (to become heterosexual) are going to stay changed; ...
most of them will go back.'' And if they do, what can Kristol and
Bauer say?
</P>
<P>
   On July 19, the Human Rights Campaign replied with its own
newspaper ad. It features a photograph of a mother, father, and
their adult lesbian daughter over the headline ``We're living proof
that families with lesbian and gay kids can be whole, happy and
worthy of all that this great country promises.'' But someone is
missing from the photograph: The couple's other daughter, who, as
they explain in the ad's fine print, ``happens to be
heterosexual.'' Both daughters were permitted to discern and define
their identities. One decided she was gay; the other decided she
was straight. Religious conservatives now claim to be fighting for
the right to make the latter decision. It will be hard for them,
with a straight face, to justify opposing the former.

 A PAGE FROM THE MODERN LIBRARY OF MARKETING  
 By JUDITH SHULEVITZ 
 (www.slate.com) 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Were he alive, cultural critic Dwight Macdonald, archenemy of
all things low- and middlebrow, would be rubbing his hands with
malicious glee.
</P>
<P>
   What could be more Midcult than the Modern Library--populist
purveyor of affordable classics--making a list of the 100 greatest
English-language novels of the past 100 years? Or the presence on
it of Thornton Wilder, Macdonald's very definition of the Midcult
author? And there's Random House founder Bennett Cerf's son,
Christopher Cerf, going on network television to advance the
defense Macdonald mocked in his 1960 essay ``Masscult &AMP;
Midcult''--that cheap marketing devices like lists are justified if
they mean that more people read more books.
</P>
<P>
   Had anyone thought to put Culturebox on TV, she too would have
defended the list, though on different grounds. Culturebox is an
avowed fan of the great American huckster tradition, whence Modern
Library stems. Among its founders: Albert Boni, flush from his
invention of the leather-bound edition of Shakespeare, so inspired
a flash of marketing genius it was deemed worthy, by the candy
manufacturer Whitman's, of inclusion in every box of chocolate
sold. In 1917, the raison d'etre of Modern Library was to offer
cheap reprints of European fiction. Today, its main claim to fame
is that it provided its owners, Bennett Cerf and Donald Klopfer,
the financial underpinnings of a far greater publishing venture,
Random House.
</P>
<P>
   The moral of that story is: If you know how to market your
backlist, you get to do the kind of publishing cultural critics
like Macdonald praise you for. That maxim is as true now as it was
then. Which is why Modern Library's list is, as such things always
are, brilliant. Irksome, middlebrow, replete with weird choices and
intellectual pretention--who cares? Who can criticize it without
advancing its agenda? Culturebox would have been reduced to silence
if she hadn't been moved to applaud.

 THE BUCK STOPS WITH THE DOC  
 By ATUL GAWANDE 
 (www.slate.com) 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   When medical practice goes wrong, who is to blame? The
traditional answer in journalism has been unambiguous: the doctor.
</P>
<P>
   If the press found out a person had died from improper care or
had had the wrong leg cut off, the reaction was predictable. A
clamor went up for the incompetent physician's head--or at least
his license. And doctors everywhere cringed. There but for the
grace of God go I, each of us would say. For all of us make
terrible mistakes. Only the unlucky few are publicly exposed.
</P>
<P>
   So I've been intrigued by the increasingly popular alternative
explanation--''the system did it.'' In many cases, this is the
right way to go. Bad systems are more often at fault than bad
doctors. I worry, however, that we have already begun to take this
explanation too far--so far that we are introducing a dangerous
murkiness into the question of who is ultimately in charge when it
comes to taking care of patients.
</P>
<P>
   Take the recent horror story in which Christopher Sercye, a
15-year-old gunshot victim, lay bleeding to death 35 feet from the
door of a Chicago hospital while the staff refused to help, citing
hospital policy prohibiting workers from leaving the emergency
room. The case provoked a national outcry. This time the white-hot
light of publicity focused blame more on the administrators than on
individual caregivers. City, state, and national officials demanded
to know how a medical facility could maintain such an appalling
policy. In an unusual step, President Clinton personally announced
that the policy was so outrageous that he would seek to have the
Ravenswood Hospital Medical Center expelled from Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   In this particular case, however, the impulse to hold the CEO
more responsible than the doctors seems wrong. What shocked me was
not so much the hospital's policy as the fact that doctors and
nurses would stick by the rules rather than help a person in
desperate need. News organizations demanded an explanation from the
hospital CEO, John Blair, but I could find no reports that
mentioned so much as the name of a staffer who had refused to help.
</P>
<P>
   This was not an isolated instance of medical personnel providing
bad care in obeisance to a policy. The Los Angeles Times recently
uncovered several cases in which doctors at Northridge Hospital in
Southern California refused to provide epidural anesthesia during
childbirth to women on Medicaid unless they anted up $400 on the
spot. The reason? It was ``hospital policy,'' patients were told.
One patient offered credit cards, a check, and finally had her
mother wire in the money, but the epidural was denied. The cash
hadn't arrived in time.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, these policies deserve scrutiny. But the real issue
here is who, ultimately, is in charge of patient care. By putting
all the blame on the rule makers, the public is implicitly
accepting that sometimes the rule makers are in charge instead of
the caregivers. That is a very recent phenomenon, and it should be
resisted.
</P>
<P>
   Hospital policies, after all, are not federal laws. They do not
demand slavish devotion. In odd cases, rules adopted for the best
of reasons can make for bad medicine. And real life is full of odd
cases. I remember one not long ago when, late at night, a patient
came into my hospital at death's door because of a rupturing
abdominal aneurysm. Understandably, our hospital forbids residents
to start operations without an attending surgeon present. But none
was around, and this guy would have died waiting. So we didn't
hesitate to break the rules and operate on our own. It was his only
chance.
</P>
<P>
   Ravenswood's policy may also have been well intentioned.
According to a hospital spokesman, it is an old policy maintained
by most hospitals to make clear that staff should not be expected
to sacrifice the care of sick patients in the ER to go hither and
yon. But the dying boy presented a case where the staff should have
broken that rule. (Indeed, the Chicago Tribune reported that a year
earlier, an emergency worker at a partner hospital with the same
policy had done just that. He ran outside to help a woman suffering
a brain hemorrhage in her car.)
</P>
<P>
   As for just plain barbaric policies, like the one at Northridge
Hospital, I see no way in which the doctors who follow them are not
ultimately culpable. To say they were obeying an administrator's
instructions is not even the slightest defense. Patients still can
(and should) insist on holding doctors responsible for providing
proper care.
</P>
<P>
   The managed care debate presents this issue in a slightly
different context. The recent clamor in the press and among some
politicians to allow patients to sue insurers for medical
malpractice makes it sound as if we are going in the wrong
direction here, too. But the semantics are important. The laws
under consideration would not actually make insurers liable for
malpractice. Instead, they would make it easier to sue insurers for
failing to pay for proper care.
</P>
<P>
   I'm all for giving patients a fair chance to contest improper
refusals of payment, but we should not lapse into calling such
refusals malpractice. Just because an insurer won't pay for a
treatment doesn't free a doctor from providing it. Essentially, a
patient in this position is uninsured. And doctors are still
ethically obliged to offer appropriate care to uninsured patients
in need.
</P>
<P>
   This might sound like I'm calling for a return to olden times,
when medical decisions were nobody's business except the doctor's
and the patient's. I'm not. That fragmented system without
oversight had its problems: deviance (not all doctors provided good
care) and cost (the doctors drove up the bills). Hospitals,
government insurers, and private insurers have stepped in with
standard guidelines for care, review of medical decisions, and
changes in how doctors are paid. Much of this systematization of
care has clearly been to public benefit. But not all of it has, and
not all of it will be.
</P>
<P>
   At the margin, we doctors have found ourselves being asked to do
things that make us queasy. A new guideline, for example, may tell
us to send heart surgery patients home earlier. It forces us to
justify doing otherwise. It's a big pain in the butt. But it is not
a command, and we should not let it become one. Perhaps the
previous way was based on nothing more than fusty old habit, and
being forced to rethink it is good for us. However, if I know the
new way is inappropriate, I cannot be permitted to cave. In Chicago
and in Northridge, the doctors should have known that blindly
following policy was bad. The buck still stops with them.

 MOGULS OF THE YEAR  
 By FRANKLIN FOER 
 (www.slate.com) 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Everyone agrees: Tina Brown's new deal with Harvey Weinstein is
a model of New Media--oh, let's use the word--synergy. There will
be a mass circulation magazine, TV shows, books, movies based on
magazine stories. It will all be hot, modern, a hone to the cutting
edge.
</P>
<P>
   Harvey, 46, and his brother Bob, 43, run the prolific and
profitable independent movie studio Miramax. While they may work in
TriBeCa, drink Diet Coke and eat day-old pizza for breakfast, and
wear mostly black, the brothers don't fit the archetype of the New
Media honcho. They hark back to another, very different model of
businessman: the 1930s studio mogul. Like Louis B. Mayer, William
Fox, and Jack Warner--the eastern European Jews who invented
Hollywood--the Weinsteins are chutzpah personified, imperious and
megalomaniac. This is an age when more and more studio chiefs are
anonymous number crunchers and dealmakers. But Harvey and Bob run
their studio as a fiefdom, imposing their will on directors and
stars. Miramax might as well be called Weinstein Bros.
</P>
<P>
   They are emperors with a discerning eye. They invite the charges
of pretentiousness by calling themselves arbiters of ``taste'' and
``highbrow.'' But any moron can produce a Tarantino knock-off or a
bit of Italian dreck and call it an art house masterpiece. The
Weinsteins actually deliver. Miramax has been the driving force
behind some of the most acclaimed films of the last decade: ``sex,
lies, and videotape''; ``The Piano''; ``Pulp Fiction''; ``Clerks'';
``Red''; ``Il Postino''; ``Trainspotting''; ``The English
Patient''; and ``Good Will Hunting.'' It has won five Palmes d'Or
(the Cannes Film Festival's top prize) and more than 100 Oscar
nominations.
</P>
<P>
   As the old moguls came from petit bourgeois immigrant families,
so do the Weinsteins. (They named the company for mother Miriam and
father Max, a diamond cutter.) After dropping out of college, the
brothers operated a second-run theater in Buffalo, N.Y., and
promoted rock concerts. In the '80s, they began distributing small
budget films no other company wanted. Miramax took off in 1988,
when a British investor poured money into it. The Weinsteins
graduated from merely distributing--buying made movies and shopping
them to theaters--to actually making movies from scratch.
(Distributed movies still constitute about half of their output.)
</P>
<P>
   The Weinsteins' entry into movie making came at an ugly moment
in cinema history. Hollywood was stagnating in the late '80s. Video
sales were cutting into box office, and big studio execs were ever
more cautious. They wedded themselves to focus groups, obsessed
over demographics, and relied heavily on formulaic action
adventures. With the exception of Orion Pictures, Hollywood studios
retreated from the accessible, carefully crafted dramas that had
built the film industry.
</P>
<P>
   Happily, the Weinsteins were a return to form, filling the niche
vacated by the major studios and bucking the car chase, machine gun
boilerplate. The brothers possess an old-fashioned, very personal
notion of product. They make movies the way they want. Most studio
heads rely on vice presidents and vast development offices: The
Weinsteins read scripts and buy films themselves. Harvey won the
nickname ``Scissorshands'' because of his tendency to chop movies
in the editing room.
</P>
<P>
   Only in the '90s did the brothers begin to reap big returns. In
1996, they grossed $250 million in domestic box office receipts. In
1997, they raked in $419 million. A key to their success: They're
cheap. Like the old moguls, they cut corners and insist on staying
within budget.
</P>
<P>
   Where studios spend an average of $40 million to make a movie,
Miramax spends $12 million. When producing a movie, it eschews
expensive stars. Instead, it uses novices (Matt Damon, ``Good Will
Hunting'') or revives washouts (John Travolta, ``Pulp Fiction'').
</P>
<P>
   In their distribution deals, the Weinsteins find genuine
bargains. Last year they bought Kevin Smith's ``Chasing Amy'' for
$250,000 and grossed $12 million. The Japanese film ``Shall We
Dance?'' came to them for $300,000 and earned $9.5 million.
Miramax's success has attracted buyers and spawned imitators:
Disney bought Miramax for an estimated $60 million in 1993 and kept
the Weinsteins at the helm under a sweet contract. Meanwhile, Fox,
Sony and Universal have launched art house subsidiaries.
</P>
<P>
   For all their superb taste, the Weinsteins really cash in on
schlock. Like their '30s antecedents, the brothers rely on B-grade
genre pics to generate the revenues to pay for artier films.
Miramax's subsidiary Dimension Films, run by Bob, has made a
handful of sci-fi and horror pics aimed at teens, such as ``Scream
2,'' ``From Dusk Till Dawn'' and ``Mimic'' (a giant-bug flick).
Last year's five Dimension films brought in nearly the same amount
as the 20 art house films Miramax released.
</P>
<P>
   The Weinsteins don't rely on business school strategies. They
are hustlers. Their aggressive marketing machine beats any in
Hollywood. (Witness their ubiquitous, clever advertising on behalf
of ``Trainspotting'' and ``The Crying Game.'') They promote
shamelessly, pioneering the practice of calling Academy Awards
voters to sway their votes.
</P>
<P>
   One of their standard devices to garner attention for a film is
to pick high-profile brawls with the Motion Picture Association, as
they did over X ratings initially given to the films Tie Me Up! Tie
Me Down!, Clerks, and Kids. All went on to make small fortunes at
the box office.
</P>
<P>
   They are similarly aggressive with the press. An example: When
Harvey got wind that Time magazine planned to reveal the plot twist
in ``The Crying Game''--that a character is a transvestite--Harvey
called a Time editor 18 times in a single day, unsuccessfully
demanding that Time not run the detail. Never mind that the movie
had been out for months and that a Best Supporting Actor Oscar
nomination had already been awarded for the portrayal of the female
character.
</P>
<P>
   Stories of the brothers' arrogance and brutality are legendary.
Variety reported that Harvey once locked a producer in a Cannes
hotel room until the producer sold Miramax the rights to distribute
his film. In 1993, Fortune magazine named them among the 70
toughest bosses in America. Fortune reported that one former
employee claims Bob fired him for making an error at a company
softball game. (The employee was later rehired, and Bob denies the
charge.) There was even a support group, Mir-Anon, where the
studio's former executives commiserated over wounds inflicted by
the brothers.
</P>
<P>
   Will Tina tame these tough guys? In many ways, she seems the
ideal match for them, and not simply because she's an expert at
massaging egos. Tina and the Weinsteins all have highbrow
pretensions but feel no shame in embracing pop culture. They all
love attention. But can the Weinsteins, who like being the only
cocks of the walk, tolerate a partner as famous and visible as they
are? Will Tina's notorious lavishness irk the frugal duo? Will the
snazzy partnership produce nothing more than a TV newsmagazine with
Tina as the talent, as Variety has suggested?
</P>
<P>
   Who knows? But perhaps history is on the Weinsteins' side: It
took jerks like the old-time moguls to bring film to maturity.
Maybe it will take jerks like the Weinsteins to bring in the golden
age of New Media.

SEE A MALADJUSTED CHILD? LOOK AT TIME SERVED IN DAY CARE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK GENRICH  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (Undated) - I have a theory about children raised in day-care
centers.
</P>
<P>
   My theory is based upon empirical evidence, nothing scientific.
</P>
<P>
   But first, a few observations by some experts:
</P>
<P>
   Karl Zinsmeister, editor in chief of the journal``American
Enterprise'' and a fellow at the American Enterprise Institute _
someone who believes that it is ``unwise'' to encourage the use of
day care _ points to an ``American Journal of Public Health''
report indicating children in day-care centers incur overall
medical expenses that are two to three times as high as those of
children cared for at home.
</P>
<P>
   A Rand Corp. study that analyzed data on 3,841 children ages 6
months to 5 years showed that attending a day-care center
``increases bed days for young children by 30 percent,'' while
youngsters attending home-based day care have 19 percent more bed
days (both compared to parent-reared children).
</P>
<P>
   A 1990 poll of U.S. pediatricians conducted by the Thomas
Jefferson School of Medicine in Philadelphia showed that 77 percent
believe babies 6 months or younger ought to be cared for only at
home.
</P>
<P>
   A different survey of 1,100 baby doctors carried out that same
year by the American Academy of Pediatricians reported that a
``substantial majority of physicians consider full-time day care
harmful for children under age 4.''
</P>
<P>
   Another expert writing in the ``Wall Street Journal'' earlier
this year pointed to the National Institute of Child Health and
Human Development study involving 1,364 children from 10 states
including diverse ethnic and socioeconomic back grounds. It
reported that a child's placement in day care provided a
``significant prediction'' of poorer mother-child interaction and
reduced cognitive and linguistic development.
</P>
<P>
   Another study at Pennsylvania State University found that
full-time day-care babies are at risk of ``heightened
aggressiveness, non-compliance and withdrawal in the preschool and
early school years.''
</P>
<P>
   So here's my theory about day care:
</P>
<P>
   The obnoxious, noisy child who is kicking the back of your
airline seat probably has some day-care experience. Perhaps the
most disturbing element about this theory is that these children
seem to be everywhere, taken to quiet restaurants, movie theaters,
plays, places of worship, graduation ceremonies.
</P>
<P>
   They are taken by parents in search of ``quality time'' with
their day-care children. It no longer seems to matter how young the
child is, it doesn't seem to matter how ill-behaved, rude, sick or
obstreperous.
</P>
<P>
   Karl Zinsmeister emphasizes that not all children who go into
day care will end up with ``weak parental bonds, aggressive
tendencies, academic problems, personal insecurities, difficulties
in peer relations, or other evidence of emotional or cognitive
damage.''
</P>
<P>
   He says lots will bounce through with few obvious effects.
Individual circumstances like a youngster's temperment, sex, and
home influences all determine how a child fares.
</P>
<P>
   But empirical data suggest that the screamer in the booth across
from you at the restaurant, or that whining child in the church pew
a few aisles back _ the one who refused attendance in the cry room
_ has some day care in his or her background.
</P>
<P>
   No public function seems to be off-limits for attendance by
unruly children. In days gone by, obstinate children were kept at
home until they could behave _ either that or they were immediately
removed from a public setting if they offended those nearby. Not
anymore. This widespread misbehavior seems rooted in parents who
surrender responsibility to day care for reasons that range from
necessity to greed to parental self-centeredness.
</P>
<P>
   But, remember, this is just a theory. &QL;

COMMENTARY: STRANGE CHANGE OF VENUE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By RUSSELL BAKER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ I am amazed to learn that Art Buchwald, dean of
American humor columnists, has moved to New York. Buchwald's home
base has been Washington ever since the British burned the White
House. They would have gone ahead and burned Georgetown too, he
wrote, but it was teatime.
</P>
<P>
   He is such a fixture down there that anybody who mentions the
Washington Monument is assumed to be talking about Buchwald. Who
could imagine Buchwald moving to New York? Would the pope move to
Las Vegas?
</P>
<P>
   With his flair for irony, Buchwald has already solved the first
problem facing everybody with New York in mind: finding a place to
live. Too stingy to pay $2 million for $115 worth of living space,
he has booked into a flossy Park Avenue hotel.
</P>
<P>
   Not only does this reduce his real estate costs; it also saves
him from having to make his own bed.
</P>
<P>
   It also relieves him of the obligation to throw those famous New
York dinner parties where everybody talks about real estate through
soup, fish, meat, salad, cheese, no-calorie dessert, decaf coffee
and piteous pleas for mercy from the dishwashers.
</P>
<P>
   Several years ago I took a youthful fling at trying to write
humor myself and tried to cultivate Buchwald and learn his secrets.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no secret to writing humor about Washington,'' he
told me. ``You just write what happened in Washington yesterday and
the whole country will die laughing.''
</P>
<P>
   I'd heard old recordings of Will Rogers speaking that line back
in the 1930s. ``I'm not surprised,'' said Buchwald. ``I told it to
Will when he was first trying to break into the business back
during the McKinley administration.''
</P>
<P>
   My attempts to cotton up to the old master were only mildly
successful. The high point of our relationship came the day at the
Sans Souci restaurant across the street from the White House when
he invited me to his table to gaze upon several Kennedys, a brace
of senators, a Supreme Court justice, Charlton Heston and Barbara
Walters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how I'll ever be able to repay this favor, Mr.
Buchwald,'' I said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can call me Art,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Well, the favor can be repaid at last. As a onetime
Washingtonian who came to New York full of doubt and terror and
learned to survive and love it, I have valuable advice for this
pilgrim.
</P>
<P>
   First of all, never make eye contact with anyone, Art, until
absolutely certain that you're not dealing with a lunatic or a
cabdriver. ``Never look a weirdo in the eye,'' is the ancient
wisdom taught New Yorkers for generations.
</P>
<P>
   Cabdrivers may or may not be weirdos, but when they see a
pedestrian crossing the street and that pedestrian looks them in
the eye, they assume that this pedestrian is now fully aware that
lethal machinery is aimed at him and is, therefore, responsible for
taking the evasive action necessary to save his skin.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Art, I would never walk in neighborhoods where you can
look up and see a construction crane looming 500 feet overhead.
These things often fall down. Make a detour.
</P>
<P>
   In my New York era, I also used to avoid skyscrapers with the
kind of glass windows that blow out on windy days and make a
terrible mess on the sidewalk.
</P>
<P>
   I don't know if windows still blow out in high wind. Maybe
windows are better nowadays. All I say is that, when the wind is
rising, personally, I still stay away from skyscrapers.
</P>
<P>
   In my time, there was a gent in the theater district who dropped
chunks of concrete from roofs, and I stayed out of that
neighborhood until I judged that his need to express himself by
mashing somebody under concrete had taken another outlet.
</P>
<P>
   You can never predict when someone like the concrete-dropper
will crop up in this great city. Wise New Yorkers read the daily
papers closely and react accordingly.
</P>
<P>
   Many people's worst New York nightmare is of being trapped
several hours in an elevator during a power blackout.
</P>
<P>
   The survival trick here is to insist on transacting all business
at ground level. You'll be astonished how many people will come
down 45 stories to see you. It gives them something besides real
estate to talk about at dinner.
</P>
<P>
   Ah, I forgot the subway. Take the subway, Art. It's terrific.
And whatever you do, don't joke about Mayor Rudolph Giuliani. This
is not Washington. Understand? The cops have their orders.

HOUSE OVERRIDES CLINTON ABORTION BILL VETO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRIS BLACK  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In a move aimed at maximizing the impact of the
abortion issue in an election year, the House Thursday voted to
override President Clinton's veto of a bill that would outlaw a
procedure critics call a ``partial-birth abortion.''
</P>
<P>
   The 296-132 vote was 10 votes more than the two-thirds needed to
override, and the measure now goes to the Senate, where the outcome
is uncertain. The Senate, which will take up the bill in September
at the earliest, so far is three votes shy of the number needed to
override the veto.
</P>
<P>
   Representative Charles Canady, a Florida Republican and prime
sponsor of the vetoed bill, predicted an ``uphill battle'' in the
Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we do not succeed in the Senate, we'll be back in the next
Congress,'' he said. ``I want to ban partial-birth abortion. We are
doing everything we can. Unfortunately, Bill Clinton has been
standing in our way every step of the way ... Think of the babies
who are subjected to this horrible practice.''
</P>
<P>
   Giving immediacy to the debate was the recent attempted abortion
in Arizona that resulted in the delivery of a baby girl. The
doctor, whose medical license has been suspended, had relied on a
miscalculation of how long the teenage mother had been pregnant.
The baby survived with lacerations to the face and a cracked skull,
and has been adopted..
</P>
<P>
   Although the House passed the bill last October, the override
vote was delayed until now to make it a campaign issue, said
lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This bill is about defeating Democrats and election-year
politics, pure and simple,'' said Representative Nita Lowey, a New
York Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   Two Massachusetts Democrats, Representatives Richard Neal of
Springfield and J. Joseph Moakley of South Boston, supported the
ban and voted for the override. Representative Edward J.Markey, the
Malden Democrat, did not vote but previously opposed the ban. The
state's seven other House members voted against the override.
</P>
<P>
   Boston Cardinal Bernard Law, chairman of the Pro-Life Committee
for the US Roman Catholic Bishops, who have actively campaigned to
outlaw late-term abortions, said Thursday, ``No nation and no
Congress, can, in good conscience, permit the killing of
partly-born infants. Soon, the Senate will have the same
opportunity. We pray that the Senate will make the right choice.''
</P>
<P>
   In his veto message last year, Clinton said the bill was bad
public policy and unconstitutional. He vetoed the bill because the
ban did not include an exception to protect a woman's health.
Opponents to the ban say the procedure is sometimes the only
alternative to protect the health and fertility of a small number
of women with crisis pregnancies.
</P>
<P>
   ``This bill targets the most vulnerable women, women who want to
be mothers who have found that something has gone terribly wrong to
either them or their babies,'' said Representative Vic Fazio, a
California Democrat. ``None of us support late-term abortions for
no reason.''
</P>
<P>
   The legislation would have imposed stiff fines and prison terms
of up to two years on physicians who use the procedure. It also
would have allowed the partner of a pregnant woman and the parents
of a minor girl to sue the doctor for monetary damages.
</P>
<P>
   In Thursday's debate, supporters of the ban described the grisly
procedure, in which the skull of a fetus is collapsed to get the
fetus through the birth canal, while opponents focused on the
health needs of pregnant women and the precedent of outlawing a
specific medical procedure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Killing a baby as it is about to be born is simply an act of
barbarity,'' said Representative Tim Roemer, an Indiana Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   There are no official statistics on the number of abortions
involving this procedure, but Representative James Greenwood, a
Pennsylvania Republican, displayed a chart showing that 99.94
percent of all abortions occur before the 24th week, when a fetus
has matured enough to live outside the womb.
</P>
<P>
   ``This bill is based on a fraud, and the fraud is that this
procedure is used frequently in late pregnancies,'' said Greenwood.
</P>
<P>
   Representative Sue Myrick, a Republican from North Carolina,
said, ``Partial birth abortion is a horrific way to end the life of
a tiny, 9-months- old baby. It has no place in a civilized
society.''
</P>
<P>
   And Representative Louise Slaughter, a New York Democrat, said,
``For the first time in the history of the republic, this congress
is trying to outlaw a medical procedure. Ask yourself, what is
next?''

GOP LEADERS SEEK A WAY TO AVOID HOUSE DEBATE ON ANTI-GAY PROPOSAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service Clients.)  
 By JUDY HOLLAND  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ House Republican leaders, nervous about possible
anti-homosexual remarks during floor debate on anti-gay
legislation, said Thursday that they have devised a strategy to
smother any fiery rhetoric on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   They hope to convert the debate over an anti-gay proposal into a
dignified discussion about presidential powers. And they will limit
the entire debate to 20 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The touchy legislation, sponsored by Rep. Joel Hefley, R-Colo.,
would nullify an executive order issued in May by President Clinton
that bars federal agencies from discriminating against gays.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican leadership in the House has combined the Hefley
proposal with legislation to nullify another executive order
expanding federal jurisdiction at the expense of state and local
governments.
</P>
<P>
   The result: a dry-as-dust constitutional debate about states
rights rather than a potentially emotional confrontation over the
hot-button issue of gay rights. The planned debate is expected as
early as Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass., an acknowledged homosexual, said the
brevity of the scheduled debate ``shows how embarrassed (the
Republicans) are by this.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very oppressive, outrageous and undemocratic way to
talk about things,'' Frank said.
</P>
<P>
   But Rep. John Linder, R-Ga., who said it was his idea to blur
the debate over Hefley's amendment, said 20 minutes of debate was
more than enough time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think five minutes is plenty on this issue,'' Linder said.
</P>
<P>
   As chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee
responsible for helping elect House Republicans this November,
Linder said he ``did not want to see a debate on the floor over the
gay issue.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm hoping to see the debate be on the broader issue of
executive orders,'' Linder said.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Jim Kolbe, R-Ariz., the only openly gay House Republican,
agreed with Linder that an all-out debate on gay rights made him
squeamish.
</P>
<P>
   Koble said he was ``not anxious for a long debate on this.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The debate is not going to be terribly pleasant,'' Kolbe said.
``I don't think anybody's mind is going to be changed by it.''
</P>
<P>
   Frank said Republican leaders resorted to the bundling tactic
because they realized there wasn't sufficient support among House
members for Hefley's anti-homosexual amendment if it stood alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Hefley amendment became the damsel in distress,'' Frank
said. ``They're trying to use the other one to rescue Hefley.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Gerald B.H. Solomon, R-N.Y., chairman of the House Rules
Committee, said GOP leaders decided to combine the proposals
because they both deal with what Republicans claim is Clinton's
abuse of executive orders to circumvent Congress.
</P>
<P>
   But Winnie Stachelberg, political director of the gay advocacy
group the Human Rights Campaign, said ``the Republicans sensed
defeat and then they backtracked.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Gay and lesbian issues are not a recipe for defeat'' for
Republicans, Stachelberg said. ``I think those who support equality
for gays and lesbians are more appealing to voters back home.
Voters want their members to treat people fairly and not to
discriminate.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Republicans agreed with those sentiments.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Christopher Shays, R-Conn., who isn't shy about taking
potshots at the GOP leadership, said in an interview he has been
``offended'' by his party's efforts to push through the Hefley
amendment.
</P>
<P>
   ``This amendment is designed to placate our so-called base,''
Shays said, referring to conservative Christian groups opposed to
homosexuality. ``I am being more and more offended by what people
feel our base is. I am pretty determined to speak out against any
statement that goes after gays and tries to dehumanize them for the
purpose of gilding our base. That is wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Mark Foley, R-Fla., said the Hefley amendment ``comes off
as mean-spirited,'' adding: ``I saw this as a potentially explosive
issue.''

BRAWLEY FAILS TO APPEAR AT PENALTY HEARING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRED KAPLAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   POUGHKEEPSIE, N.Y. - The Tawana Brawley saga came sputtering to
its finale Thursday, much as it began 10 years ago _ with crowds of
people wondering, ``Where's Tawana?''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, Stephen Jackson _ the lawyer for C. Vernon
Mason, one of the three Brawley advisers on trial here for falsely
accusing Stephen Pagones of abducting and raping Brawley in 1987 _
announced that Brawley would appear as a witness on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   But Thursday, Jackson had to confess to a packed courtroom that
she was a no-show.
</P>
<P>
   The anticipation, then letdown, came near the end of the second
phase of this eight-month-long trial.
</P>
<P>
   The first phase ended 10 days ago, when the jury found Mason and
the other two advisers _ the Rev. Al Sharpton and Alton H. Maddox _
guilty of defaming Pagones' character.
</P>
<P>
   In the second phase, the jury will determine how much money the
three should pay him in damages. Pagones, who was an assistant
district attorney at the time of the accusations, is asking for
$395 million.
</P>
<P>
   Brawley has never testified about her accusations, which set off
some of the most bitter tensions of a racially charged decade. She
and her mother refused to cooperate with a 1988 grand jury, which
exonerated Pagones and concluded that Brawley _ who, like her three
advisers, is black _ had probably concocted her story about six
white men raping her and scrawling obscenities on her body.
</P>
<P>
   During the first phase of the trial, Judge S. Barrett Hickman
invited Brawley _ who is now 26 and living in Maryland _ to
testify. But she never replied.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson surprised everyone _ including, it seemed, his client's
co-defendants _ when he tried to invite her this week. At first,
Hickman denied the motion, saying it was too late; the question of
whether the rape happened, and whether the advisers lied about it,
had already been settled, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But then, the judge changed his mind _ as he has so often in
this drawn-out case _ and said her testimony might be pertinent,
after all.
</P>
<P>
   At that point, Maddox, who is representing himself, disowned the
whole idea, saying he did not want Brawley to come to the
courthouse.
</P>
<P>
   Maddox is closer to Brawley and her family than are the other
two advisers. He was her lawyer, and last December, as the trial
got underway, Brawley made her first public appearance in a decade
at a Brooklyn rally in Maddox's honor.
</P>
<P>
   William Stanton, Pagones' lawyer, said Thursday he never
expected Brawley to appear. ``It's a poker game,'' he remarked.
Jackson was bluffing all along, ``and the judge said, `OK, I call
your hand.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, Brawley had little incentive to appear. Stanton
declared that if she did appear and again accused Pagones of raping
her, he would file a complaint charging her with perjury.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, Brawley herself is a defendant in this case. Long
before the trial began, she was found liable by default for not
answering Pagones' subpoena. By testifying at all, she would be
opening herself up to cross-examination about the entire case.
</P>
<P>
   Several dozen black supporters of Maddox, who have regularly
been coming up to the trial by train or chartered buses, seemed
disappointed by Brawley's absence Thursday. But several defended
her in angry tones when questioned afterward by the nearly
all-white press corps.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the devil!'' one black man, who identified himself only
as ``a brother from ancient Egypt,'' said of Pagones. ``Why would
she want to come here and look at the face of the devil?''
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers on both sides are scheduled to give closing statements
Friday before the jurors _ four whites and two blacks _ head off to
their final round of deliberations.

 McCURRY TO DEPART AS WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY  
 (bl)  
 By JAMES BENNET   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In a sign of growing confidence at the White House
that it is weathering the Monica Lewinsky investigation, Mike
McCurry, who has used an agile wit and aggressive tactics to
promote the administration and defend it from scandal, will resign
as press secretary this fall, President Clinton announced Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The president referred Thursday to McCurry's skill at gliding
just beyond a question's reach. ``His ability to respond to
developments precisely _ and, when necessary, not so precisely _
have made him a unique and instrumental element of our nation's
public diplomacy around the world,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   With that sort of sleight-of-mouth, along with a lopsided grin
and a sharp appreciation for the needs of news organizations,
McCurry has managed to maintain cordial, respectful relations with
the press, even while insisting that he was ``out of the loop'' and
unable to answer questions about Ms. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   He will be replaced by Joseph Lockhart, who served as Clinton's
1996 campaign spokesman before becoming one of McCurry's deputies
last year.
</P>
<P>
   The transition, which will take place when Congress leaves in
October, is part of a broader White House changeover that has been
frozen since January, when Clinton was accused of having an affair
with Ms. Lewinsky and covering it up.
</P>
<P>
   McCurry and several other high-ranking Clinton advisers had
hoped to leave after the president's first term to take more
lucrative and less consuming jobs in the private sector. But they
delayed their departures for fear of creating an image of a White
House in panicked retreat.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``For a lot of us, there was a period of time in the beginning
and the first half of the year that it felt like it wasn't the
right time to be leaving,'' one senior administration official
said, on condition of anonymity. ``But now we've sort of settled in
here.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to McCurry, Rahm Emanuel, a senior adviser to
Clinton, is planning to leave this fall. Two aides said that they
expect that chief of staff Erskine Bowles will also leave by the
November elections. And Doug Sosnik, a close adviser to Clinton, is
also considering departing _ though he has been doing so for so
long that he has joked he left and came back.
</P>
<P>
   It is a measure of how much turbulence has shaken the White
House this year that the departure of some of the president's most
trusted lieutenants would seem a sign of growing stability.

TRAVEL LOG  
 FENDER-BENDERS ON THE DIGITAL HIGHWAY 
</HEADLINE>
  By STEPHEN C. MILLER 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   My colleague claims she suffers from BLK _ Bad 'Lectronic Karma.
She believes that her mere presence causes electronic devices to
malfunction: ``If I so much as look at my VCR, the clock starts
blinking 12:00.''
</P>
<P>
   I know how she feels. I had one of those weeks where nothing
worked properly.
</P>
<P>
   My first instance of BLK came when I was testing two new
multifunction cards from 3Com. It was time to check out 56K modems.
</P>
<P>
   I've always liked the idea of PC Card modems because they make
it so easy to upgrade _ the cards pop into a slot on the side of a
laptop. And a multifunction or ``combo'' PC Card lets you have a
modem and a network interface card (NIC) in the same device,
meaning you can dial up a remote computer or hook into the office
network without switching cards. Putting these functions on one
card frees up a slot.
</P>
<P>
   Those of us who attach to our company networks at various branch
offices need the flexibility of both dial-up and direct local-area
network connections.
</P>
<P>
   This is especially important to me because I have an external
CD-ROM drive and a Jaz disk drive. Both are SCSI devices, so I can
daisy-chain them off of a single PC Card SCSI adapter.
</P>
<P>
   Before using a combo card, I had to keep swapping the LAN card
and modem card if I needed to use the CD-ROM drive at the same
time.
</P>
<P>
   The two 3Com cards both had 56K modems. One had a 10 megabits
per second (Mbps) network interface card with an Xjack connector.
The other had the dual-standard 10/100 Mbps card, with a big fat
plug or ``dongle'' for the modem connection.
</P>
<P>
   I happen to like the dongles on the 3Com cards. Unlike many
modem dongles which are small and easy to forget when you are
packing up your system in a hurry, the 3Com dongle is big enough
that it stands out, but is still small enough that it is not a
burden to carry.
</P>
<P>
   I tested the card with the Xjack connector first. It worked as
advertised: The card connected to our network without any problems,
and the modem dialed every remote service I use. One of my services
supports the V.90 standard for data transmission, and there was a
noticeable increase in my connection speed.
</P>
<P>
   The 10/100 Mbps card was another issue.
</P>
<P>
   The connection to the local network went fine, but when I tried
using the modem, it would not hold a connection or would not
connect at all.
</P>
<P>
   I went through all the diagnostics, which said that everything
was working properly. Windows reported that it was not conflicting
with any other device and was working perfectly.
</P>
<P>
   It was time to enter the voice-mail hell that is technical
support. I'm not singling out 3Com; I've had problems with the tech
support of just about every company in the computer business.
</P>
<P>
   It's not the quality of the technical support, it's the
automated phone system. Once you get a human on the phone, problems
are usually taken care of without much hassle.
</P>
<P>
   After the required preliminaries of ``press 1 if you want an
endless loop, press 2 if you want us to put you on hold for 10
minutes before disconnecting and requiring you to call back and
start over,'' I got through to an actual person.
</P>
<P>
   Dan was quite helpful and seemed to know his stuff. But he
couldn't get the modem to work either. He said he wanted to check
one other source, and asked if he could call me back in about 10
minutes. He called back in about three minutes.
</P>
<P>
   We tried a few more things, and he finally declared that the
modem was fine, but that the dongle was probably defective. He
would transfer me to the parts-replacement people, and they would
arrange to get me a new dongle. Two days later, it arrived, and the
modem now works fine.
</P>
<P>
   My second karma deficit hit when I tried to return a laptop.
When I finish with a computer that the manufacturer has sent me to
evaluate, I remove all the programs I installed while I was testing
it. I put a lot of stuff on these machines. They have to mirror my
regular working computer so that I can test them by doing all the
things that I would normally do.
</P>
<P>
   This cleanup usually takes place in my office, where I keep all
the installation disks of all my programs.
</P>
<P>
   While I had a particular reason for cleaning up the hard drive,
it is not a bad idea to periodically back up your hard drive, wipe
it, reformat it and reload everything from scratch. Your hard drive
works hard and gets banged around in cars, trains and planes. This
periodic cleanup _ about once a year or so _ allows it to operate a
little more efficiently.
</P>
<P>
   On this occasion, I was doing the cleanup at home. I backed up
my data on my Jaz drive, then went to the Control Panel and clicked
on ``Add/Remove Programs.'' It was then a simple matter of clicking
on the programs I wanted to remove and watching the software do its
thing.
</P>
<P>
   That is, until I came to Microsoft Office 97 Professional. I was
told that I needed the original CD-ROM in order to remove the
program. The CD-ROM was back in the office. Nothing I tried could
get me past that error message.
</P>
<P>
   I finally broke down and called Microsoft Technical Support.
They were very helpful, but said that uninstalling Office without
the disc is not recommended and is for the technically astute. You
have to delete entries in the Registry _ a misstep here can cause
your system to stop working.
</P>
<P>
   After dealing with the Registry, you have to manually delete all
the Office folders and a long list of files in the system folder.
</P>
<P>
   I found the instructions on how to do this in the Microsoft
Knowledgebase, the company's online support area. Be sure to make a
backup of your Registry before you attempt to do this.
</P>
<P>
   Most people will never need to uninstall Office at all, let
alone without the disc, and (as they say in MSErrorSpeak) ``it is
strongly recommended'' that you have the disc if you have to do it.
</P>
<P>
   Let me second that recommendation. I got back to the office and
couldn't find the disk, so I had to follow the instructions. I did
it, but I never want to repeat the experience.
</P>
<P>
   My final BLK involved the long-awaited arrival of the Apple
PowerBook G3. Great, I thought, I can finally review the unit and
stop the weekly complaints from Mac enthusiasts who think I'm part
of the ``WinTel Conspiracy.''
</P>
<P>
   The PowerBook came with the best system protector I've ever
seen. Instead of that white Styrofoam stuff, it rested on a
designer plastic air pillow. Way cool.
</P>
<P>
   After charging the battery, I turned on the unit and discovered
that the right shift key didn't work. I called Apple for a
replacement. Unfortunately, the new unit arrived a day after I had
left town for a week-long trip. This is not a conspiracy _ I really
do want to evaluate the G3.

EDUCATION 
 NEW AFTER-SCHOOL GIG: TEACHING GROWN-UPS HOW TO SURF 
</HEADLINE>
  By PAMELA MENDELS 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's hard to miss Joshua R. Hammer as he paces the floor of the
main branch of the Queens Borough Public Library in Queens, New
York. He's the clip-board toting 16-year-old with neatly-cropped
hair, a soft-spoken demeanor and a T-shirt bearing the motto: Ask
Me How to Search the Net.
</P>
<P>
   Hammer, a computer user since he was 9 years old, is one of
about 90 high school students earning pocket money this summer and
throughout the school year by teaching befuddled patrons how to use
the library's online resources.
</P>
<P>
   Like other participants in the library's ``Teen 'Net Mentor''
program, he spends his time assisting people _ including
library-goers five times his age _ how to do everything from
finding a book in the library's electronic catalogue to finding a
job on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   ``I try to teach the people who may not know anything the basics
in five to 10 minutes,'' Hammer said earlier this week, as he
paused between turns at fixing an uncooperative printer for one
patron and spelling out the URL for a popular search engine for
another. ``I teach them the mouse. The buttons _ back, forward and
home. That most blue underlined things are links. Just the basics
so they can search themselves. People usually pick up on it.''
</P>
<P>
   Teaching neophytes ``to pick up'' the basics is getting to be a
new occupation for teen-agers around the country, as libraries,
schools and community groups turn to 'Net savvy young people to
bridge the generations and help those who grew up when the term
``mouse'' referred exclusively to a small furry mammal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a great idea,'' said Karen W. Smith, executive
director of the Tech Corps, a national non-profit volunteer group
based in Bedford, Mass., that seeks to help schools integrate new
technology in the classroom. ``Anytime kids are in a situation that
says 'We value what you know,' that's a very good message. These
programs also give kids the knowledge that what they are learning
is transferable to a marketable talent.''
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to say how many programs there are involving
teen-agers who teach grown-ups. But within a few hours earlier this
week, a query about the subject to a library public relations
listserv garnered a dozen or so responses, with examples of
programs using teenagers to help everyone from military veterans to
participants in senior citizen projects.
</P>
<P>
   Just this week, at the main branch of the Martin County Library
System in Stuart, Fla., teen-agers _ and some children as young as
fifth grade _ began teaching Internet basics classes to adults who
had enrolled in the library's new FloriNet Families Online program.
</P>
<P>
   After undergoing a library training course, the young
instructors work with grown-ups to teach them how to use the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Organizers are hoping that one effect of the project will be to
forge closer ties between adults and young people. They are also
hoping that some of the embarrassment adults feel when first
encountering the Internet will be abated because they are working
with young people and ``do not feel the pressure they would feel
with a peer,'' said K. Janette Alley, a reference librarian and one
of the organizers of the project.
</P>
<P>
   In Philadelphia, a teen/adult technology program was used as a
way to introduce immigrants to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, Edison Freire, who teaches science in a bilingual
program at Edison Fareira High School, asked a group of his
bilingual students to volunteer to work with Spanish-speaking
adults studying to earn high school equivalency diplomas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am trying to get my students to think of themselves as
leaders, and one way to do that is to let them work with adults,''
Freire said.
</P>
<P>
   The adult participants learned such essentials as how to find
Web versions of newspapers from their homelands. One result of the
program was the Latino Tech Collective Family Web Publishing
Project, which enabled the students to describe their lives on a
simple Web site.
</P>
<P>
   For Hammer and the other instructors in the Queens Teen 'Net
Mentor program, one challenge is quickly assessing what a patron
knows and doesn't know.
</P>
<P>
   The teen-agers have become adept at recognizing telltale signs:
the patron who holds up a mouse and presses it as if it were a
remote control device; the patron who stares blankly at the
computer screen and does not know how to proceed.
</P>
<P>
   The next challenge is providing tactful assistance. Mahjabin S.
Ahmed, a friendly 16-year-old mentor who hopes one day to be a Web
designer or computer programmer, recalls trying to find the words
to soothe the anxiety of a 34-year-old man using a mouse for the
first time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said to him 'That's OK,''' she recalled. ``The computer
hasn't been around for 100 years. It's new and people need to take
their time to learn it.'''

UNITED ASSET MANAGEMENT PROFITS FALL 7.9 PERCENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LYNNLEY BROWNING  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   United Asset Management Corp. said Thursday that profits plunged
7.9 percent in the second quarter, evidence of the Boston-based
investment company's struggle to stanch asset outflows and make its
acquisition strategy work.
</P>
<P>
   The company, a conglomerate of 53 acquired firms that is among
the nation's largest money managers, said it would intensify
efforts to help only its most promising subsidiaries.
</P>
<P>
   UAM's net income fell to $22.1 million, or $0.32 per diluted
share, from $24 million, or $0.33 a share, a year ago. The losses,
expected by analysts, come at a time when other asset management
firms with multiple units are growing earnings.
</P>
<P>
   While revenues rose 16 percent to $254.4 million from $219.6
million a year earlier, the gains came from fees earned on rising
assets in a growing stock market, and not from new business. UAM
lost business last quarter, as clients yanked out $4.3 billion in
assets from troubled subsidiaries. Around $1 billion of that total
came from UAM's liquidation of a failed unit, HMH Investment
Advisors, Inc. of Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Negative net client cash flow has dogged UAM for years.
Customers pulled out $4.7 billion in the first quarter of 1998
after $16 billion in 1997 and $3.3 billion in 1996, prompting UAM
to reassess its original strategy of functioning as an umbrella
company for multiple firms. The outflows were mostly responsible
for total assets under management decreasing $3.8 billion last
quarter to $210.1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``We recognize that negative net client flow at certain UAM
affiliates continues to be unacceptably large,'' UAM chairman and
chief executive Norton H. Reamer said.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts fault UAM's policy of buying 100 percent of
subsidiaries and leaving them free to operate as they wish, an
arrangement that can dent managers' incentives to boost earnings.
In a rethinking its strategy, UAM said it was intensifying its
partnership with high-performing units rather than keeping them at
arm's length. Still acquisition-minded, UAM is now interested only
in firms with major growth potential.
</P>
<P>
   On a brighter note, the company's operating cash flow, used to
fund acquisitions, repurchase shares, and pay dividends, rose 8
percent to $57.2 million from $52.7 million a year ago. UAM has
been buying back its shares in a bid to boost its flat stock price.
The company's stock slipped 1 1/8 to close at 27 3/4 on the New
York Stock Exchange.

ISRAEL IS CAUTIOUS IN CONDEMNING IRANIAN MISSILE TEST  
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: See also IRAN, IRAN-U.S. and ROSENTHAL-COLUMN) 
(js) 
 By SERGE SCHMEMANN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Israel on Thursday treated Iran's test of a
medium-range missile as confirmation of its insistent warnings over
many months about Iran's efforts to develop a long-distance
strategic threat.
</P>
<P>
   But Israeli officials did not treat the test itself as an
immediate threat to Israel, noting that there was no indication yet
that Iran had a missile that could accurately hit targets in
Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Officials also speculated that the test might have been intended
more as a political signal than as a test of technology. They noted
that it coincided with the arrival of Vice President Al Gore in
Moscow, where one of his goals was to try to press the Russians
into stopping their role in Iran's missile-development program.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a developing threat, a serious threat in the Middle
East,'' Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai said. ``What this means
is a greater budget allocation, more resources, more motivation and
more deterrence, and if, God forbid, there is a need for this, to
do whatever is necessary to protect the state of Israel.''
</P>
<P>
   The relatively low-key reaction, which was echoed in the modest
attention given the test by the Israeli radio, apparently reflected
a political ambivalence about the significance of the test. It was
noteworthy that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu issued no
statement.
</P>
<P>
   Israel has been issuing stern warnings for a year-and-a-half
that Iran was working hard to develop long-range missiles.
According to Israeli officials, Iran obtained some North Korean
Rodong missiles several years ago, but since then it has been
working to develop its own missiles, known as Shehab.
</P>
<P>
   Iran has already test-fired Shehab-3 and Shehab-4 missiles.
Israel's major concern has been that Russian scientists and
enterprises are playing a crucial role in the project. For that
reason, Netanyahu and Trade Minister Natan Sharansky _ the
government official most closely involved in the matter _ have
lobbied hard in Washington for the United States to press Moscow to
halt the assistance.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington the issue has turned into another tussle between
the White House and Congress. Last month, President Clinton vetoed
the Iran Missile Sanctions Act, under which sanctions would have
been imposed on Russia for its activities in Iran, arguing that the
matter was better handled with quiet diplomacy.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Moscow did appear to be taking steps to curb its help to
Iran in recent weeks. In an unprecedented development, Nikolai
Kovalyov, the head of the Federal Security Bureau, the Russian
intelligence agency, visited Israel this month for extensive talks
with Sharansky and other officials about the Iranian situation,
evidently to Israel's satisfaction.
</P>
<P>
   The cautious Israeli reaction thus evidently reflected a desire
not to undermine the diplomatic efforts when they seemed about to
bear fruit, and especially when Gore was in Moscow.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The White House was equally cautious. Clinton's spokesman,
Michael McCurry, stressed that the missile tested on Wednesday was
a North Korean one, and neither he nor other officials in
Washington named Russia as a culprit in the test.
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview, Sharansky suggested that Iran might
have fired the missile deliberately to demonstrate that there was
no point in trying to block its program.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe Iran did this now to show America that it's too late,
that the train has left, that they have rockets,'' Sharansky said.
``Our information is that there is still time before Iran gets a
long-range rocket. If we block all the leakage of information, we
can block the whole project.

   ``This testing was apparently not entirely successful, and we
have doubts that they even had electronics on the missile,''
Sharansky continued. ``It's possible this was less a technical
necessity than a political signal.''
</P>
<P>
   The Israelis also seemed concerned that Iran's missile program
would be perceived solely as a threat to Israel. Modechai's
spokesman, Avi Benayahu, argued that the test should be seen as a
threat to Arab countries like Saudi Arabia and the entire free
world.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think if Iran finishes all these tests and concludes the
project, it's against not just Israel, but against Europe, against
American interests in the gulf,'' he said. ``We think it's global,
and there should be an international mission now to stop this
project.''

 CAN SOFTWARE BE PROTECTED AS FREE SPEECH? 
</HEADLINE>
  By CARL S. KAPLAN 
 Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Can openers are not protected by the First Amendment. This
should come as no surprise. After all, can openers and other
gadgets are not a form of expression.
</P>
<P>
   But what about a recipe for pumpkin pie, or a guide to home
repair? These can be useful 'tools,' but they are also forms of
speech, fully protected by the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   The distinction between a gadget and a recipe was at the heart
of a recent federal court ruling that denied First Amendment
protection to encryption computer software.
</P>
<P>
   On July 2, in a closely-watched decision, Judge James Gwin of
the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Ohio ruled
that Peter Junger, a law professor, could not challenge on First
Amendment grounds government regulations that restricted his
dissemination of computer software that can encrypt messages.
</P>
<P>
   Junger, a professor at Case Western Reserve University Law
School in Cleveland, Ohio, teaches a course in computers and the
law. He had sought to post on his Web site various encryption
programs he had written as demonstrations. In the fall of 1997,
Junger challenged the government's enforcement of the export
regulations, claiming that his encryption software was protected by
the First Amendment.
</P>
<P>
   In response, the government asserted in legal filings that
encryption software was outside the scope of free speech
protection. In addition, government lawyers claimed the export
restrictions on encryption software, once maintained by the State
Department but now supervised by the Department of Commerce, were
necessary for national security, lest terrorists and other
adversaries gain the capability to veil their messages from the
eyes of U.S. intelligence agents.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Junger had no plans to export the software himself,
posting it on the Web would make it available for downloading
worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   In denying Junger's motion to have the case dismissed, Gwin
considered the important question of whether encryption source code
warrants First Amendment protection. Source code, a series of
instructions written by the programmer, is converted or
``compiled'' into the machine-level code that the computer can run.
</P>
<P>
   Reasoning that only speech or conduct that fosters the spread of
ideas is within the scope of the First Amendment, Gwin concluded
that encryption source code is not deserving of First Amendment
protection because it is not ``expressive'' but rather is an
``inherently functional'' device.
</P>
<P>
   The source code ``is designed to enable a computer to do a
designated task,'' carrying out the function of encryption, said
Gwin. ``In doing this function, the encryption software is
indistinguishable from...other encryption devices,'' such as
computer hardware or telephone scramblers.
</P>
<P>
   Gwin's decision is in stark contrast to a 1996 decision by Judge
Marilyn Hall Patel of the Federal District Court in San Francisco.
In that earlier case, Bernstein v. United States, Patel also
considered whether encryption source code was protected by the
First Amendment.
</P>
<P>
   Grasping the nettle from a different angle, Patel declared that
computer source code was a form of writing in a foreign language,
and language, by definition -- whether German, French or Fortran --
is protected speech under the First Amendment.
</P>
<P>
   The functionality of encryption source code was not a bar to
First Amendment protection, added Patel. Reaching for a metaphor,
she wrote, ``Instructions, do-it-yourself manuals, recipes, even
technical information about hydrogen bomb construction...are often
purely functional; they are also speech.''
</P>
<P>
   Gwin, in his ruling, addressed Patel's decision and called it
``unsound.''
</P>
<P>
   ``While a recipe provides instructions to cook, source code is a
device, like embedded circuitry in a telephone, that actually does
the function of encryption,'' he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   The Bernstein case has been appealed and is currently pending
before the Ninth Circuit. Junger said he expects to appeal his case
to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 6th Circuit. Legal experts
agree that it is likely one or both cases will eventually reach the
Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Froomkin, a cryptography expert who is a law professor
at the University of Miami, said he believed that Gwin was wrong to
conclude that encryption source code was an inexpressive gadget.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is absolutely correct to say that gadgets are not speech.
But is source code a gadget? I think computer programmers would
tell you that source code is, in fact, expressive,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, once you define source code as purely functional,
you get to do away with the First Amendment -- you're in
widgetland,'' added Froomkin. ``Apparently, one court thought
(source code) was a widget, the other thought it was a recipe. This
is an example in law of how metaphors matter. It's how the legal
mind works. That's how we teach our students -- to reason by
analogy.''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Junger insists encryption source code is a form of
speech that communicates ideas. ``Source code does contain words
and figures,'' he said. ``My position basically is that things that
one writes and communicates (to others) are obviously expressive.''
</P>
<P>
   Junger added that he thought Gwin had set up a false dichotomy,
because a form of speech could be functional and laden with ideas
at the same time. For example, ``some speech can make someone else
mad,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Junger added that he has been waging his battle against the
government on a shoestring, through the kindness of his volunteer
attorneys. In the wake of the recent court decision, he said he is
confident that some contributions will be sent to his
recently-created legal fund.
</P>
<P>
   Not all encryption legal experts agree that Gwin was off the
mark, however. Stewart Baker, a partner at the Washington law firm
of Steptoe &AMP; Johnson and former general counsel at the National
Security Agency, said he believed the court's decision was
``respectable.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Reading the decision gives you a feeling of how someone who
isn't influenced by the atmosphere of Washington or Silicon Valley
looks at things,'' Baker said, adding that it is easy for one to
conclude that encryption source code is not expressive. ``Most
people don't view source code as a way to communicate ideas; it's a
way to manipulate computers,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Baker added that Gwin might also have been reluctant to
second-guess the government on an issue of national security.
``That kind of concern doesn't show up in a footnote to the
opinion, but it's a fair wind that...helps the government get past
its rough spots,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As the legal cases on encryption software flow through the
appeals courts, the potential exists to break the political
stalemate in Congress on encryption policy, said Barry Steinhardt,
president of the Electronic Frontier Foundation, which sponsored
the Bernstein litigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now there is a strong section in Congress that is
pushing hard to relax the export regulations,'' said Steinhardt.
``But the push back from the National Security Agency and the FBI
is equally strong. We get a slight movement from the Commerce
Department from time to time. If these cases succeed (in
establishing First Amendment protection for software), then they
will change the landscape dramatically.''
</P>
<P>
   At stake in the broad debate over the export of encryption
software is the use of encryption by U.S. citizens at home. Legal
experts say that as long as domestic manufacturers are prevented
from exporting strong encryption products abroad, they will not
manufacture and distribute those same wares in the U.S., where the
use of encryption is legal.
</P>
<P>
   Without the strongest methods of encryption to protect privacy,
electronic commerce will not fully flourish, said Froomkin of the
Miami law school. He added that average citizens require strong
encryption for another reason, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think people's need for anonymity is just about to explode
in a world where it's incredibly easy to develop data profiles on
everybody who uses the Net,'' he said. ``People will want to have a
method to anonymize their actions...and the foundation of that is
encryption.''

 A BLUES ALBUM WITH LIVELY LINER NOTES 
</HEADLINE>
  By MATTHEW MIRAPAUL 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Miles Davis album ``Kind of Blue'' continues to be one of
the best-selling jazz albums of all time. The 1959 recording serves
as the cornerstone of countless music collections and remains
undiminished in its ability to draw new listeners to jazz through
its moody atmosphere and brilliant instrumental solos.
</P>
<P>
   On July 14, Sony Music launched a World Wide Web site to support
the latest reissue of ``Kind of Blue'' on compact disk. The online
project brings to mind half of another Davis title, ``Birth of the
Cool.'' The immortal ``Kind of Blue'' has no need to be reborn, but
the site itself is undeniably cool.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to brief but revelatory sound clips unearthed from
the original recording sessions and a gallery's worth of rare
photographs, a key feature of the site is its ability to interact
with ``Kind of Blue,'' provided that a copy of the new audio disk
is in the CD-ROM drive of the computer.
</P>
<P>
   With a correctly configured system, viewers can watch the
transcribed score of the first 32 measures of ``So What'' scroll by
as the tune plays, or click on a photo of John Coltrane to trigger
the saxophonist's solo on ``Freddie Freeloader.'' The Internet
supplies the images, which appear in a pop-up window about a third
of the size of a full browser frame, but the CD is the source of
the high-quality sound.
</P>
<P>
   These living liner notes are made possible by a bit of software
that Sony calls ``ConnecteD.'' The tiny piece of computer code
takes just seconds to download from the Sony site, and not much
longer to install. ConnecteD works in tandem with Shockwave, a free
``plug-in'' program that extends the audio and video functions of
Web browsers, to access precise passages of music from an audio
disk in the CD-ROM drive. The excerpts can be a complete track or a
single note.
</P>
<P>
   With ``Kind of Blue,'' Sony has used the technology to
synchronize two sections of the loping tune ``So What'' with
musicological analyses. It's also used to link 22 of the album's
solos to their performers' photos and relevant comments by Miles,
taken from his autobiography.
</P>
<P>
   ConnecteD's benefits are not fully demonstrated here. It's a
thrill to follow a rectangle as it slides through a transcription
of the trumpeter's acclaimed ``So What'' solo while the music
plays. But only four musical excerpts accompany the dissection of
the composition by Todd Coolman, a bassist and jazz educator.
Coolman's scholarly analysis is replete with phrases such as ``the
goal notes of the melody alternate in each odd numbered measure
between D4 and A3.'' A few more audible examples would help to
illustrate his comments for readers who are not music theorists.
</P>
<P>
   And while the combination of text, pictures and sound in the
site's ``Solos'' section results in a nifty multimedia scrapbook,
one yearns for something more educational, perhaps a head-to-head
comparison of the two renditions of ``Flamenco Sketches.''
</P>
<P>
   To assure that Web content and music act as one, Sony intends to
wire the site so that access requires a copy of the latest reissue
(catalogue number CK 64935, easily identified by the bright-yellow
``definitive version'' sticker on the cover).
</P>
<P>
   Yet some of the graphically evocative site's most interesting
</P>
<P>
   material resides wholly on the Web. Staff photographer Don
Hunstein documented the ``Blue'' sessions, and all of those images
-- many of them previously unpublished -- have been dug out of the
company's archives and posted on the site, according to Rene
Arsenault, an A&AMP;R coordinator for the label's jazz program. Also
online are a video clip of Davis soloing during a live performance
of ``So What,'' and an audio interview with the drummer Jimmy Cobb,
the only surviving member of the session.
</P>
<P>
   The most remarkable finds, though, are a trio of audio snippets
consisting of outtakes and studio chatter from the sessions. To
hear Miles interrupt the first take of ``Freddie Freeloader'' with
a growled ``That's too fast'' is akin to perusing Ezra Pound's
edits of T.S. Eliot. In another clip, the producer Irving Townsend
stops a song to complain about ambient noise, including vibrations
from the snare drum. ``That goes with it,'' Davis informs him.
</P>
<P>
   Arsenault hinted that additional outtakes may appear on the
``Blue'' site at a later date. ``There is more music,'' he said,
although he added that all the complete versions of songs have been
issued.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kind of Blue'' is the fourth entry in Sony's series of
ConnecteD titles, joining disks by Ben Folds Five, Ozzy Osbourne
and Yo-Yo Ma. The company says that the technology allows it to
convert any audio disk into an enhanced CD by placing the
multimedia content on the Web instead of the silvery platter.
Because the Web is a dynamic environment, tour schedules and other
information can be updated, although the company has yet to take
advantage of this feature. Unfortunately, those with slow modem
connections must cool it while the Shockwave files download, a
process that can take a thumb-twiddling minute or three.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of the ``Kind of Blue'' site, the wait is worth it.
Davis's location in the jazz pantheon has led to any number of
tribute sites, like the recently launched milesdavis.com and fan
endeavors like Miles Ahead. But unlike those others, there is new
material here that gives new insights, albeit modest ones, into the
recording process.
</P>
<P>
   In his interview, Cobb recalls the ``Blue'' sessions. ``They
want to say that it's one of the greatest instrumental jazz records
ever made,'' he said. ``I had no idea that was happening.'' Forty
years later, the ``Kind of Blue'' Web site gives a better idea of
what happened.

   WASHINGTON _ Homeowners in 11 scorched Southern states will be
eligible for $100 million in emergency federal aid to buy fans and
air-conditioners and pay soaring electric bills, President Clinton
announced Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The president also declared all of drought-stricken Texas an
agricultural disaster area, making farmers and ranchers there
available for government relief payments and low-interest loans.
</P>
<P>
   ``All Americans have been deeply concerned and troubled by the
human toll of the record heat wave that has spread across many
parts of the United States,'' Clinton said in appearance in the
White House briefing room. ``It has destroyed crops, led to
widespread power outages, and, worst of all, has resulted in the
deaths of over 100 people.''
</P>
<P>
   But even as he was declaring a disaster, the president could not
resist making a partisan political point. He said that House
Republicans had voted to eliminate the Low Income Home Energy
Assistance Program, the source of the emergency money for
air-conditioning.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Congress proceeds to try to eliminate all funding for this
vital emergency assistance, it would be an act of political
irresponsibility,'' Clinton said. ``It would put partisanship ahead
of the progress and the people of this country.''
</P>
<P>
   The energy program, known as LIHEAP, was established in 1980
during the energy crisis to help the poor pay their heating bills.
Opponents of the program contend that it has outlived its
usefulness, as energy prices have fallen sharply over the last few
years. They say that genuine emergencies can be funded through
other social service programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no question whatsoever that there is a need that must
be met here,'' said Rep. John Edward Porter, R-Ill., who advocates
elimination of LIHEAP. ``But we ought to take a look at the states
assuming responsibility for what is basically a welfare program.''
</P>
<P>
   The money will be made available to low-income homeowners in
Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, North
Carolina, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Tennessee and Texas.
Temperatures in those states have ranged from 16 percent to 26
percent above average since June 1.
</P>
<P>
   The sweltering summer has also exacerbated a farm crisis that
has seen agricultural income decline 35 percent from two years ago
and driven hundreds of farmers out of business in the northern
Great Plains.
</P>
<P>
   In Texas, where temperatures reached 100 degrees for the 18th
straight day Thursday, three quarters of the cotton crop has been
lost to drought. In North Dakota, auctioneers are being brought out
of retirement to sell land and equipment from bankrupt farms.
</P>
<P>
   The president's disaster declaration for Texas will help those
whose crops and livestock have been ravaged by the heat. Officials
said they could not estimate how much money ultimately would be
involved in the disaster relief program.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Iran's test of a medium-range missile on Wednesday
apparently blew up in the later stages of the flight, American
officials said Thursday. But they said they did not know whether it
had blown up on its own or whether the Iranians had detonated it on
purpose before impact.
</P>
<P>
   But the missile traveled far enough and well enough to sharpen
concern in Washington, Israel and the Persian Gulf countries about
Iran's growing capacity to deliver weapons of mass destruction in
an arc that encompasses Israel, Saudi Arabia, Turkey and parts of
Egypt and Russia.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton said the missile, if it becomes operational,
could change the ``stability dynamics'' of the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   State Department spokesman James Rubin said, ``The test is
significant, because it shows that Iran's aggressive effort to
develop missiles more capable than its existing shorter-range Scud
missiles is making progress.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a source of concern to us that they are pursuing a
program of this nature,'' said Mike McCurry, the White House
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   American officials also expressed concern about the technical
help Iran has been receiving from Russian companies to improve the
performance of the missile, which is largely based on the North
Korean Rodong. Last week the United States placed trade
restrictions on nine Russian companies for their secret help to the
Iranian missile program, including help with guidance technology
and materials.
</P>
<P>
   But the American officials also said Iran had not chosen to buy
and deploy a fleet of Rodongs, which it could do, much as Pakistan
did ``when it bought a Rodong, painted it green, called it the
Ghauri and tested it,'' a senior American official said. Instead,
Iran is trying to develop its own technology based on the Rodong,
they said.
</P>
<P>
   The officials saw the Iranian test of the Shahab-3, with an
800-mile range, as a political demonstration of prowess and
strategic reach, noting that the shorter-range Scud-type missiles
that Iran has long possessed can hit Baghdad, the capital of Iran's
main rival, Iraq. ``This is an anti-Saudi and anti-Israel weapon,''
one official said.
</P>
<P>
   The officials also noted that the CIA, in classified briefings
to Congress this year, revised previous estimates that Iran was
years away from developing a medium-range missile and said that it
might reach that goal in months.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``Iran's success in gaining technology and materials from
Russian companies, combined with recent indigenous Iranian
advances, means that it could have a medium-range missile much
sooner than I assessed last year,'' CIA Director George Tenet
warned in unclassified testimony.
</P>
<P>
   But some members of Congress had sharp criticism of the
administration, saying it should be less open to overtures from
President Mohammad Khatami, a moderate whom they said clearly did
not hold real power in Iran.
</P>
<P>
   ``Iranian words and deeds are not matching,'' said Sen. Sam
Brownback, R-Kan., who heads the Senate Foreign Relations
subcommittee on Near East and South Asian affairs. ``I think this
test shows who has the power in Iran. We should be soft in our
words toward the Iranian people, but harder in our actions. And we
should not waive sanctions on Iran that just provide money to the
people with the power, who are developing nuclear weapons and
missiles.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Richard Shelby, R-Ariz., who chairs the Senate Intelligence
Committee, said that the test highlights continuing proliferation
problems that require America to develop and deploy a national
system of missile defense.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli and American efforts to get North Korea to stop
exporting missiles and missile technology have been unsuccessful,
and officials say such exports are North Korea's largest source of
hard currency.
</P>
<P>
   Last month North Korea said it would continue to export missiles
for money because of economic sanctions imposed on it by the United
States, but American officials said Thursday that it was
conceivable a deal could still be made with the North Koreans to
lift sanctions in return for a halt in missile exports. &QL;

RIGGS SCALES BACK ANTI-GAY MEASURE AIMED AT SAN FRANCISCO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service Clients.)  
 By JUDY HOLLAND  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The sponsor of anti-gay legislation aimed at the
city of San Francisco disclosed Thursday that he has drastically
cut back his proposal in an effort to pick up more support for it
in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Frank Riggs, R-Calif., drafted legislation last week to bar
federal funds from some government programs in San Francisco if the
city continued to require its private contractors to provide the
same benefits to unmarried domestic partners as they provide to
married couples.
</P>
<P>
   The new version of the Riggs' proposal, an amendment to the
appropriations bill for the federal departments of housing and
urban development and veterans affairs, states that ``none of the
funds appropriated by this act may be used to implement'' the
city's domestic partners' ordinance.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Riggs said he wanted the funding ban because San
Francisco was ``trying to force a particular political belief, a
doctrine if you will,'' on others.
</P>
<P>
   Riggs, who represents California's North Coast from Napa to the
Oregon border, denied his plan was an attack on gay rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``People's sexual orientation is their own private business,''
he said, adding that he has ``no problem'' with the city of San
Francisco offering domestic partner benefits to city employees. But
he said it was ``a tremendous stretch'' for the city to try to
force private businesses to offer domestic partner benefits, which
usually take the form of medical insurance coverage.
</P>
<P>
   The San Francisco board of supervisors adopted the domestic
partners ordinance, effective June 1, 1997, requiring city
contractors to provide the same benefits to the domestic partners _
gay and straight _ of their employees as they would to married
couples.
</P>
<P>
   Gay rights advocates hailed the measure as an important step
toward equality.
</P>
<P>
   Beau Phillips, the congressman's spokesman, said the new version
represented a scaled-back version of the original.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, the amount of federal funds will be smaller'' under
the new version of Riggs's amendment, Phillips said.
</P>
<P>
   Phillips said Riggs changed the measure because the original
version would have been subject to procedural challenges under
House rules.
</P>
<P>
   ``This amendment accomplishes the same thing,'' Phillips said.
``It is intended to stop the city of San Francisco from using
federal dollars to impose its will on contractors.''
</P>
<P>
   But Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass., who acknowledges he is gay, said
Riggs was forced to soften his proposal because it lacked support
on the House floor.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Ivers, spokesman for Log Cabin Republicans, a gay advocacy
group, agreed. ``It sounds to me like they gave up, but they did it
in a face-saving way,'' said Ivers.
</P>
<P>
   Ivers said Riggs bowed to pressure from Republican supporters of
federal housing for people with AIDs. Some 30,000 people with AIDs
in San Francisco would have lost at least some, if not all, of
their federal housing support under the original Riggs amendment,
according to Ivers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's clear tonight that the Republican leadership is in full
retreat,'' Ivers said. ``We are going on the offensive now and
we're going to defeat both of them and we're not going to let them
change the subject. It's too late to put the toothpaste back in the
tube.''
</P>
<P>
   Winnie Stachelberg, political director of the gay advocacy group
the Human Rights Campaign, said the move by Riggs to soften his
amendment ``was very clearly a retreat.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a clear sign that Mr. Riggs (and the Republican
leadership) knows that going after gay people is not going to win
you votes and probably ensures a loss.''
</P>
<P>
   But, Stachelberg added, ``they are still going after the city of
San Francisco for passing a city ordinance that it has full
authority to implement. The intent of the Riggs amendment is still
the same.''

`WILL'S' GAY LEAD PLAYS IT CHASTE 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOHN CARMAN  
 c.1998, San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. - After the wreckage of ``Ellen,'' how does a
television series handle another lead character who is gay?
</P>
<P>
   With extreme caution, judging by ``Will &AMP; Grace.''
</P>
<P>
   The NBC comedy, scheduled for Monday nights in the fall, is
about a pair of attractive New Yorkers, Will Truman and Grace Adler
(Eric McCormack and Debra Messing), who are a couple, except that
he's gay.
</P>
<P>
   Besides McCormack's Will, the show also features actor Sean
Hayes as Will's flamingly gay friend, Jack.
</P>
<P>
   With a gay executive producer, Max Mutchnick, ``Will &AMP; Grace''
could be on track to advance television's shaky standards for the
depiction of gays.
</P>
<P>
   Or to be accused of caving in to a double standard, which is
what happened this week when critics pounded Mutchnick for making a
chaste pilot episode.
</P>
<P>
   Chaste for the character of Will, who has supposedly just ended
a seven-year relationship and has no new lover in sight. Not so
chaste for Grace, who's in bed with a man in the pilot's first
scene.
</P>
<P>
   A contentious session at the TV summer press tour in Pasadena
points to the delicacy of Mutchnick's dilemma. He clearly wants to
develop a realistic lead character in Will. But giving Will an
early sex life might alienate viewers and kill the show.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems to me it's a no-win situation,'' said McCormack, a
heterosexual actor in a homosexual role. ``You know, we don't have
a (male-to-male) kiss in the pilot, or maybe for a while. So we're
going to get some crap for that.
</P>
<P>
   ``But if we put a kiss in the first scene of the pilot, it would
be considered controversial. For everyone that went, `Good for
you,' somebody else would go, `Oh, it's a stunt.'''
</P>
<P>
   Mutchnick, his co-producer David Kohan and director James
Burrows argued that the show's focus is a nonsexual friendship
between a man and a woman, who'll become roommates. The series,
Mutchnick said, isn't ``Will &AMP; Wayne.''
</P>
<P>
   But still: Grace will, Will won't. At least for a while. NBC has
ordered 13 episodes. Mutchnick, who has written for ``The Dennis
Miller Show'' and ``Boston Common,'' said he expects Will to date
in at least one of them. Meantime, he said, viewers ``have to fall
in love with the man. Let's take baby steps.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever restraints the producers are feeling, they said NBC
isn't the source.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have been no absolutes,'' Mutchnick said of his
discussions with the network about Will's sexuality. ``We've just
been told, from everybody on top, everyone who is involved with the
show, `Write it honestly.' And that's the way we'll approach it.
... If it comes up and it's right, and it feels good and we can do
it in an entertaining way, it will happen. ...
</P>
<P>
   ``The character is who he is. I don't think we're hiding at this
point. But I feel like you guys (the critics) want us to talk about
something that we're not _ it hasn't come up yet, you know? I mean
when it does, when it starts to feel awkward, we'll feel that too,
and we'll write to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Things started to feel awkward _ then all right, in an
entertaining way _ at the press session itself.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, a male Philadelphia writer strode to the stage, at
Burrows' invitation, to kiss the director on both cheeks. Then
another Philadelphia reporter, a lesbian, made her trip up to give
Messing a kiss, after Messing told her, ``You have to come up and
kiss me.''
</P>
<P>
   Mutchnick watched that and said, ``You're not going to like what
I'm going to ask for.''

<P>
   TOKYO _ If the Japanese public had its way, Foreign Minister
Keizo Obuchi would not become the next prime minister. But a day
before the vote to choose the man who will almost certainly lead
the country, the reserved Obuchi looked like a sure bet for the
job.
</P>
<P>
   Opinion polls show voters clamoring for his two rivals: the
veteran politician Seiroku Kajiyama and the upstart Health and
Welfare Minister Junichiro Koizumi. But the electorate's opinion
has little real influence because Friday's vote is to choose a new
president of the governing Liberal Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   Party members will therefore be doing the choosing, although the
man they select is all but certain of being prime minister because
the Liberal Democrats control the lower house of Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the week junior party members seemed about to rebel
against the back-room power-broking among factions that has long
settled the pecking order in Japanese politics. But Thursday more
and more seemed to be reluctantly coming to the conclusion that the
best way to achieve their goals was to toe the lines drawn by party
leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have been explaining my decision to my constituents, knowing
that some people would react very strongly against my choice of Mr.
Obuchi,'' said Yoshitaka Shindo, 40, a legislator whose district is
in Saitama Prefecture. ``I tell them about his general abilities
and decision-making abilities, and I think people understand it.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Shindo, who is a member of Obuchi's faction, is
well aware that his choice bears significant political risks. Like
many younger members of the party, he knows that if Obuchi does not
move quickly to repair this country's ailing financial system and
set the economy back on track, he himself will probably lose his
job in the next lower house election.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Obuchi-san falls, I will fall and the party will fall,''
Shindo said. ``But I am ready to commit collective suicide.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the public's disgust with political business as usual
grows more apparent every day. Thursday's Yomiuri Shimbun, one of
Japan's largest papers, published a poll showing that the Liberal
Democratic Party's approval rating had sunk 8 percent since June to
a record low of 20.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a strong weapon for us,'' said Taro Kono, a 35-year-old
party member who is ignoring the lead of his faction leader, former
Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa, and supporting Kajiyama. ``We're
going around knocking on members' doors and handing them a copy of
the paper.''
</P>
<P>
   It is clear that this election, to choose a successor to Ryutaro
Hashimoto, who resigned after the party suffered a decisive setback
in upper house elections on July 12, is causing more soul-searching
among party members than any in the past. For the first time that
anyone can remember, there is a ``floating'' vote of about 10
percent to 20 percent of the party membership that refuses to be
pinned down by pollsters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the race is decided yet,'' said Nobutero
Ishihara, a young legislator from a district in Tokyo.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Indeed, party members like Kono and Ishihara have been pushing
for ways to insure the secrecy of each vote on Friday in hopes that
a truly secret ballot might result in a last-minute shift of
alliances.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday night the head of the party's election committee said
the panel would do its utmost to insure privacy around the voting
box. In the past it was not unusual for party members to scribble
the name of the candidate they supported onto a piece of paper and
show it to colleagues before stuffing it into a ballot box.
</P>
<P>
   Little effort was made to make the voting secret, either by
printed ballots to protect votes from being identified by the
handwriting or by providing a booth in which to vote.
</P>
<P>
   But whether a more secret process will tilt the vote out of
Obuchi's favor is unclear.
</P>
<P>
   Some legislators who are struggling with their choice are coming
to the conclusion that while he may not be the best man for the
job, Obuchi is the best of the three contenders.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best person to become party head is Mr. Kato,'' said
Yoshitaka Murata, a junior member whose district is in Okayama
Prefecture, referring to Koichi Kato, the secretary general of the
party and a leader of the Miyazawa faction. ``So we are forced to
choose between second best or even lower-rated people.''
</P>
<P>
   Murata considers Obuchi his best choice, even though in a poll
of his constituents Obuchi placed last.
</P>
<P>
   ``We politicians, while we listen to our constituents, our job
is also to persuade them,'' he said. ``I will explain to them why I
voted for Mr. Obuchi and why he is best and maybe they will
understand.'' &QL;

 McCURRY TO DEPART AS WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In a sign of growing confidence at the White House
that it is weathering the Monica Lewinsky investigation, Mike
McCurry, who has used an agile wit and aggressive tactics to
promote the administration and defend it from scandal, will resign
as press secretary this fall, President Clinton announced Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The president referred Thursday to McCurry's skill at gliding
just beyond a question's reach. ``His ability to respond to
developments precisely _ and, when necessary, not so precisely _
have made him a unique and instrumental element of our nation's
public diplomacy around the world,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   With that sort of sleight-of-mouth, along with a lopsided grin
and a sharp appreciation for the needs of news organizations,
McCurry has managed to maintain cordial, respectful relations with
the press, even while insisting that he was ``out of the loop'' and
unable to answer questions about Ms. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   He will be replaced by Joseph Lockhart, who served as Clinton's
1996 campaign spokesman before becoming one of McCurry's deputies
last year.
</P>
<P>
   The transition, which will take place when Congress leaves in
October, is part of a broader White House changeover that has been
frozen since January, when Clinton was accused of having an affair
with Ms. Lewinsky and covering it up.
</P>
<P>
   McCurry and several other high-ranking Clinton advisers had
hoped to leave after the president's first term to take more
lucrative and less consuming jobs in the private sector. But they
delayed their departures for fear of creating an image of a White
House in panicked retreat.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``For a lot of us, there was a period of time in the beginning
and the first half of the year that it felt like it wasn't the
right time to be leaving,'' one senior administration official
said, on condition of anonymity. ``But now we've sort of settled in
here.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to McCurry, Rahm Emanuel, a senior adviser to
Clinton, is planning to leave this fall. Two aides said that they
expect that chief of staff Erskine Bowles will also leave by the
November elections. And Doug Sosnik, a close adviser to Clinton, is
also considering departing _ though he has been doing so for so
long that he has joked he left and came back.
</P>
<P>
   It is a measure of how much turbulence has shaken the White
House this year that the departure of some of the president's most
trusted lieutenants would seem a sign of growing stability.

(js) 
 By DAVID BARBOZA   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Frank Zarb is standing in his office, wielding his
signature prop, a Louisville Slugger embossed with his name, and
he's grinning one of his signature giant-killer grins.
</P>
<P>
   Zarb is not a home-run hitter like Ken Griffey Jr. or Mark
McGwire, but in his own way the 63-year-old chairman of the
National Association of Securities Dealers, the parent company of
the Nasdaq stock market, has been slugging them out of the park
this year and shaking up the financial markets in the process.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, Zarb reached deals to fold the American Stock
Exchange and the Philadelphia Stock Exchange into NASD as companion
exchanges to Nasdaq. And now he is thinking of going abroad,
discussing an alliance with the Deutsche Borse in Frankfurt,
Germany.
</P>
<P>
   Since arriving at NASD early last year as a kind of Mr. Fix-it,
Zarb has been a man in perpetual motion, racing around the globe
promoting a new Nasdaq, the ``Next Nasdaq,'' as one slogan says.
</P>
<P>
   The bold moves are aimed at creating what Zarb calls a ``market
of markets,'' a global financial network that will pose an even
greater challenge to Nasdaq's chief rival, the richer and more
prestigious New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Bold as they are, though, the moves are just Zarb's attempt to
ride a larger wave of change, one that is transforming trading
worldwide. At a time when investors are increasingly turning to
Internet trading and other low-fee electronic formats, pressure has
been building on traditional exchanges not only to keep pace with
technology but to sharply lower costs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's time to challenge the status quo,'' Zarb, a longtime Wall
Street player, said in a recent interview in his office at the
headquarters of NASD here. ``I came to a very early conclusion that
the velocity of change was going to be upon us and that we had to
do something.''
</P>
<P>
   Looming over Zarb and his counterparts at other exchanges is the
most sweeping makeover of financial markets in the last quarter
century, experts say. By the millennium, the result could be the
initial stages of a global electronic marketplace. Not since ``May
Day'' 1975, when the era of fixed commissions came to an end in the
United States, has the structure of financial markets been put
through such a flurry of activity.
</P>
<P>
   The changes include a worldwide push toward consolidation.
Overseas, the London, Frankfurt and Paris stock exchanges plan to
form alliances aimed at creating a Pan-European exchange. Early in
July, the Chicago Board of Trade and the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange agreed to combine back-office operations. (On Thursday,
the Chicago Board Options Exchange and the Pacific Exchange
announced a merger.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people don't understand that we're in the beginning of a
revolutionary change in the U.S. market structure,'' said Douglas
Atkin, who heads the international unit of Instinet, an electronic
trading network owned by Reuters. ``This is making the whole
process from mutual fund management to settlement more efficient.''
</P>
<P>
   The driving forces behind all this change are technology and
globalization. Computers and software are lowering costs and making
trades faster and more efficient. And in a mature bull market,
financial exchanges _ like the big companies they list _ are
looking for global growth.
</P>
<P>
   To the average U.S. investor, the changes mean that buying
shares of Coca-Cola, Microsoft or even Deutsche Telekom could be
much easier and cheaper in the coming years. Global 24-hour trading
is not far off, and dabbling in bonds, options and futures could
come at the click of a mouse.
</P>
<P>
   There are those who worry that the melding of exchanges could
result in monopolistic tendencies and that regulatory and
accounting issues will cloud a global financial network. Still,
industry executives see the rapid pace of change lowering costs,
driving a global surge in the sale of stocks and other financial
products.

NO JAIL FOR REPORTER REFUSING TO REVEAL SOURCES, JUDGE RULES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS C. PALMER JR.  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Boston Globe medical reporter Richard A. Knox avoided being sent
to jail for contempt of court Thursday, as a Superior Court judge
took under advisement a motion asking that Knox be forced to reveal
confidential sources in a libel case.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a waste of a good jail cell,'' said Judge Peter Lauriat,
who previously has ordered Knox to reveal his sources. ``Jail is
always a possibility but is not frankly useful in this case.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Lauriat suggested he might fine The Boston Globe, a
co-defendant in the lawsuit, an amount of money that after some
period would double every day until Knox or the newspaper disclosed
the information.
</P>
<P>
   The case involves an article Knox wrote in March 1995 about the
1994 death of Globe medical columnist Betsy A. Lehman, who died
from an overdose of chemotherapy. Knox's article named Dr. Lois
Ayash, then at Dana-Farmer Cancer Institute, as one of several
doctors or nurses who had signed the flawed medication order.
</P>
<P>
   Ayash is suing Dana-Farber as well as Knox and the Globe, saying
she was unfairly blamed for Lehman's death. She had not signed the
order. The Globe published a correction in June 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Ayash has sought to force Knox to reveal his
confidential sources. The Globe has said it misread a copy of the
written order and did not rely on any confidential sources for that
part of the article.
</P>
<P>
   In February, Lauriat ordered Knox to reveal the sources, saying
reporters enjoy no special protection from having to provide
information in court cases. Knox has refused.
</P>
<P>
   In previous, unrelated cases, the Supreme Judicial Court has
upheld such a right, and Globe executives have said they would
appeal any action forcing Knox to relinquish his sources.
</P>
<P>
   Ayash is charging defamation and libel, among other allegations.
Her lawyer, Joan A. Lukey of Hale and Dorr, said the identities of
Knox's sources are necessary for Ayash to pursue her suits against
the Globe and Dana-Farber.
</P>
<P>
   ``The court did a balancing test,'' Lukey said Thursday, and
measured the rights of the newspaper against Ahash's need for the
information. ``We need relief.''
</P>
<P>
   Lukey proposed a civil contempt finding against Knox and a
$1,000-a-day fine against the Globe. As an alternative, Lukey asked
the judge to enter a libel finding against the newspaper, as if a
trial had been held, with damages to be determined later.
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan M. Albano of Bingham Dana, representing the Globe,
suggested that Lauriat respond to Knox's refusal only by
disallowing the use of material provided by the confidential
sources in any libel trial that is held.
</P>
<P>
   Albano argued that the legal rule under which Lauriat is being
asked to hold Knox in contempt requires ``the punishment fit the
crime.''
</P>
<P>
   Responding to the judge's indication that he wasn't
contemplating jail, Knox said, ``I'm relieved. My wife will be very
happy, too.
</P>
<P>
   Alfred S. Larkin Jr., Globe vice president and assistant to the
publisher, said, ``Any time a judge decides not to send a reporter
to jail to protect a confidential source, it's a good outcome.''
</P>
<P>
   Lauriat said he would consider Thursday's arguments rule later
on the motion.

 WASHINGTON: financial products.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Zarb did not ignite the change, of course; he merely seized upon
it. But perhaps more than any other market leader, he says he is
willing to ride the frenzy to transform Nasdaq into a truly
electronic marketplace with links to other exchanges.
</P>
<P>
   Zarb is neither a commanding speaker nor a visionary, but
colleagues say he has a fiery temperament and knows how to usher in
change. And that is what is necessary for Nasdaq, which has been
promising to revolutionize Wall Street since the early 1970s, when
it arrived as an automated quotation system for the
over-the-counter market. Even though it has landed high-technology
giants like Intel and Microsoft, Nasdaq's image has been tarnished
by a history of lax regulatory practices and a price-fixing scandal
among its dealers that surfaced a few years ago.
</P>
<P>
   One of Zarb's tasks is to change that image. Already, he says,
NASD has tightened regulations, offered individuals better access
to the market and laid the foundation for a group of financial
exchanges that provide both auction trading, in which agents for
buyers and sellers meet directly on crowded floors, and electronic
systems that link dealers around the world. Nasdaq is even testing
direct Internet trades.
</P>
<P>
   The Big Board's answer? A big marketing effort to sustain its
status as the premiere marketplace, home to perennial all-stars
like General Electric and AT&AMP;T. Its slogan is ``The world puts its
stock in us.'' And, for the most part, it does.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Grasso, chairman of the New York Stock Exchange, has
brought in dozens of major foreign listings in the last few years.
And while the Big Board has not struck a deal with another large
exchange and its leaders disagree over whether technology will lead
to the demise of its trading floor, Grasso does not ignore the
pressures. ``This is the beauty of the American market landscape,''
he said. ``You have alternatives, and that heightens our
competitive focus.''
</P>
<P>
   Zarb is determined to be more than an alternative. He wants to
establish Nasdaq as a superior model to the auction system. And he
knows something about overcoming adversity.
</P>
<P>
   He grew up in Brooklyn, the son of a refrigerator repairman, and
studied nights to earn an MBA at Hofstra University. Before long,
he found himself at the investment firm of Cogan, Berlind, Weill &AMP;
Levitt, in the company of Sanford Weill, now the chief executive of
Travelers Group, and Arthur Levitt Jr., now chairman of the
Securities and Exchange Commission. He left in the 1970s for a
stint in the Labor Department under President Richard Nixon and
became ``energy czar'' under President Gerald Ford after the Arab
oil embargo.
</P>
<P>
   But he has always come back to Wall Street, where he has made a
fortune. In 1987, Weill asked Zarb to take over the ``beleaguered
Smith Barney,'' as he says it was known. He managed to raise its
profile and its profitability. He also ran Alexander &AMP; Alexander
Services, an insurance broker, in the 1990s. And then came the
offer to head NASD.
</P>
<P>
   When Zarb arrived, Wall Street firms were pressing the exchanges
to lower their costs because of the boom in Internet trading and
the growth of alternative trading systems, such as the Electronic
Communications Networks, an SEC-approved system that matches buyers
and sellers.
</P>
<P>
   But the new competitive arena was international. ``In Europe,
there's a huge competitive race between the Big Board and the
Nasdaq,'' said William Freund, an economics professor at Pace
University. ``Daimler-Benz, for instance, recognized you need a
presence in the U.S. because if you're going to buy a company here,
the currency is no longer cash, it's stock,'' he said. Daimler was
the first German stock to list itself directly on the New York
Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   For Nasdaq, the proposed marketing and listings alliance with
the Deutsche Borse is one path to international glory. Nasdaq has
also started a marketing campaign in Europe and continues to
promote itself as a model for younger, growth-oriented exchanges
like Easdaq, a kind of European Nasdaq, and Ausdaq in Australia.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Europe is awash in speculation about other alliances.
And there is talk, both in the United States and in Europe, about a
global system that could offer unified trading in the world's 1,000
largest companies.
</P>
<P>
   In this new world, however, competitive concerns are not limited
to stock exchanges. The Chicago Board of Trade, the world's largest
futures exchange, faces a challenge from Cantor Fitzgerald, a Wall
Street brokerage firm, which has teamed up with the New York Board
of Trade to start an electronic futures exchange that promises to
be cheaper. The Chicago exchange, which maintains a huge trading
floor, plans to counter with its own electronic system, even though
many members are reluctant to undermine their frenzied face-to-face
call-and-answer system.
</P>
<P>
   ``The competitive landscape is rapidly changing,'' Patrick
Arbor, chairman of the Chicago exchange, said in a report in June.
``And the rabbit that dawdles in complacency may indeed find itself
losing the race to the perceived turtle.''
</P>
<P>
   Alfred Berkeley III, the president of Nasdaq and the man who
heads Zarb's lineup against the Big Board, does not intend to
dawdle. His vision is of a Nasdaq that will be linked to exchanges
around the world as well as to private trading systems like
Optimark, a new automated trading method that could eliminate
layers of brokers and middlemen.
</P>
<P>
   The Big Board, however, has not exactly embraced the electronic
revolution. Technology, yes; electronic trading, no. The
face-to-face auction system, Grasso says, is simply the best and
most efficient model, and there are no plans to change that. ``You
never say never,'' Grasso said, ``but I've yet to see a technology
replicate it.''
</P>
<P>
   At the heart of the debate over the future of exchanges is what
they will look like. Some may resemble Nasdaq, which operates a
huge computer center in Trumbull, Conn., with chilled rooms
populated by mainframe computers and blinking screens but few
people. For the Big Board, it will remain a cacophonous floor of
traders and brokers, augmented by sophisticated technology.
</P>
<P>
   William Harts, vice chairman of the Philadelphia Stock Exchange,
says there will always be a need for an exchange-like entity, if
only to fulfill a regulatory function. ``But the writing on the
wall may mean an exchange is not a physical floor,'' he said. ``All
these exchanges are not merging for the fun of it _ they're merging
because at some point the physical floors become less important.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet even as many Wall Street participants are skeptical about
whether computers can replace the human touch, in Europe,
Australia, Canada and even in the United States, technology appears
to be winning the battle.
</P>
<P>
   And Zarb is betting in that direction, even while hedging with
auction trading on the American Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything's going to be linked,'' he said. ``Everything's
going to be connected.'' And in the center of things, Zarb said
with that same long-ball hitter's look in his eye, will be Nasdaq.

 &HT;    Floyd joins Bulls as coach stand-in
 &HT;    By Curtis Bunn
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- The Chicago Bulls reopened the door for Phil Jackson
to return as coach on Thursday, saying Iowa State's Tim Floyd was
hired as insurance should Jackson decide to stay retired.
</P>
<P>
   In making the announcement, owner Jerry Reinsdorf and general
manager Jerry Krause put the ball back into the hands of Jackson
andMichael Jordan, who has said that he does not want to play for
anyone but Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   If Jackson decides to return, Floyd, named director of
basketball operations, will handle other duties. If Jackson
declines the invitation, Floyd will coach the team _ with or
without Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson's agent immediately squelched the idea of Jackson
returning. ``He's not coming back,'' Todd Musburger told a Chicago
television station. ``Although it's kind of them to say, `Come
back, Phil, your chair is available,' it's not going to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the Bulls won their sixth NBA championship in June,
Jackson talked about retiring to Montana for a year. His dislike
for Krause was evident, especially after the general manager
summoned Jackson to his office before Chicago's first practice last
season and ordered him to tell the gathered media that 1997-98
would be his last year as coach.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Jackson said: ``Wild horses couldn't bring me
back.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson reportedly refused a one-year contract extension days
after the Bulls defeated the Utah Jazz in the finals.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're leaving open the option for Phil, Michael and Scottie
(Pippen) to return to defend the championship,'' Reinsdorf said.
``And if they don't, we have a coach in place.''
</P>
<P>
   Reinsdorf said Floyd, who compiled a 243-130 college coaching
record, was the clear choice over Charlotte assistant Paul Silas,
Indiana aide Rick Carlisle, Cleveland assistant Ron Rothstein and
young Phoenix assistant Scott Skiles.
</P>
<P>
   Floyd told Reinsdorf and Krause during a meeting on Sunday that
he would not accept the coaching job as long as there was a
possibility Jackson would return, or if it meant that Jordan would
not come back. Floyd proposed the coach-in-waiting proposition.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all about Michael Jordan's wishes,'' said Floyd, 44.
``It's too great an opportunity to pass up. I always wanted to
coach in the NBA. If I have to wait my turn, I will.''
</P>
<P>
   Floyd, who led the University of New Orleans to two NCAA
Tournament berths before leaving for Iowa State, said, ``I will be
prepared,'' if he is called upon to coach the upcoming season.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Phil doesn't return, I hope Michael will come back and play
for me; I really do,'' Floyd said. ``I would love the opportunity
to coach Michael Jordan.''
</P>
<P>
   Jordan has said that he would not play for a college coach and
mocked Floyd as ``Pink,'' a reference to the rock group Pink Floyd.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan won't make an official announcement about his future
until the NBA lockout ends, and Floyd's hiring won't change that,
said David Falk, Jordan's agent.

 &HT;    SENATORS OFFER REVISED AGRICULTURE GUEST WORKER PROGRAM
 &HT;    EDS: UNBUDGETED
 &HT;    By LARRY LIPMAN
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Moving with unusual speed, the Senate agreed
Thursday to a plan to replace the current agricultural guest worker
program with one that gives top priority to filling jobs with
domestic workers.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate action came on an amendment offered by Sen. Gordon
Smith, R-Ore., and Sen. Bob Graham, D-Fla., to the
Commerce-State-Justice departments appropriations bill. The
amendment was adopted 68-31 and the entire bill later passed 99-0.
The bill now heads to a conference with the House, which did not
include the guest worker plan in its version.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am pleased that we won this important victory on the Senate
floor, but the real winners are the individuals who work hard to
feed families in Florida, the United States and around the world,''
Graham said. ``They deserve an agricultural labor program that
gives farmers access to a quality, legal workforce and improves
wages and benefits for farm workers.''
</P>
<P>
   Organizations representing various growers and farmers endorsed
the bill while those representing farm workers have voiced vigorous
objections to it, warning that it will result in a reduction in
farm workers' wages.
</P>
<P>
   The guest worker provision would phase out the existing H2A
agriculture guest worker program over five years and replace it
with a computerized registry of legal domestic farm workers. Visas
would be issued for foreign agricultural workers only after all
available domestic workers within an area had been employed. The
waiting list for visas would be reduced from 60 days to 21 days.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would eliminate the current wage rate set by the Labor
Department and replace it with a wage rate of the higher of the
minimum wage or 5 percent above the average prevailing wage in the
area.
</P>
<P>
   The bill also would eliminate the requirement that growers
provide housing for guest workers. Instead, it would allow them to
give workers a voucher to help them pay for housing.
</P>
<P>
   The existing program has been widely criticized as
bureaucratically cumbersome and unable to meet the needs of growers
to obtain legal workers when needed. A recent General Accounting
Office study estimated there were at least 600,000 agricultural
workers in the United States who are not in this country legally.

 &HT;    Ruffin quietly takes helm of UNC board
 &HT;    By Chris Burritt
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DURHAM, N.C. _ In the 1950s, when segregation snuffed out the
aspirations of many black people, Ben Ruffin followed the advice of
a high school teacher and took classes in sewing.
</P>
<P>
   Tailoring seemed a reasonable vocation for the son of a
hard-working maid and an alcoholic father who faded in and out of
his family's life on Durham's poor West End.
</P>
<P>
   Ruffin wound up aiming higher. Next month, in a historic moment
for the 56-year-old who once turned cuffs at Boykin's Tailor Shop
and for America's oldest public university, Ruffin will preside
over his first meeting as chairman of the University of North
Carolina Board of Governors. Elected two weeks ago in a surprising
16-15 vote that ousted sitting chairman Cliff Cameron, a retired
Charlotte banker, Ruffin is the first African-American elected to
one of the most powerful positions in North Carolina. In the
two-year term, he leads the prestigious board of mostly white and
male political appointees that sets policies and doles out $2.1
billion a year in state funds for UNC's 16 public universities.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, an increasing number of African-Americans have
headed the boards of public university systems. In Georgia,
Atlantan Juanita Baranco chaired the Board of Regents. It's still
relatively uncommon, and many in North Carolina view Ruffin's
election as significant.
</P>
<P>
   ''Ben's election represents a milestone in our state history,''
said Julius Chambers, 61, a former Charlotte civil rights lawyer
who now serves as chancellor of North Carolina Central University
in Durham. As a UNC board member in the 1970s, he resigned over
what he considered the state's foot dragging in desegregating its
public universities.
</P>
<P>
   A1981 settlement between UNC and the Reagan administration
brought improvements that are helping the state's historically
black colleges catch up to predominantly white institutions.
</P>
<P>
   Ruffin's election has spurred speculation that he might attempt
to shift greater resources to North Carolina's historically black
colleges, including his alma mater, North Carolina Central. Ruffin
said he won't do that.
</P>
<P>
   In similar fashion, Ruffin said he does not believe that his
one-vote margin in an election that historically has been
uncontested signals a potential for divisiveness among board
members.
</P>
<P>
   ''I do not have personal goals. I plan to work with the board,''
said Ruffin, a board member since 1991 and, most recently, its vice
chairman.
</P>
<P>
   Five of the six black board members voted for Ruffin. The one
who did not, High Point businessman Bob Brown, said he voted for
Cameron, retired chairman of First Union Corp., because ''he has
been a friend of mine for 20-some years. I think Ben will do a good
job.''
</P>
<P>
   Ruffin reaches way back, to the strict upbringing of his mother,
Catherine, for what he says will be his cooperative attitude. She
taught him to be courteous.
</P>
<P>
   ''When I walked up and down Carroll Street, I know that my
mother required that I speak to everybody who was sitting on their
porch,'' Ruffin said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Ruffin remembers the racial slights of the 1950s and '60s
whenever he ventured outside of his neighborhood. One of five
brothers and sisters, he grew up in a 2 1/2-room apartment. Back
then, Carroll Street was unpaved and steep _ illustrative of
Ruffin's career that has spanned the eras of segregation,
affirmative action and the gradual diversity of higher education.
After high school, Ruffin became a civil rights leader in Durham.
In 1964, he earned a bachelor's degree in education from North
Carolina Central.
</P>
<P>
   He later received his master's degree in social work from
UNC-Chapel Hill. In 1977, he joined Gov. Jim Hunt's administration
as a housing adviser and minority affairs director. He then became
vice president of North Carolina Mutual Life Insurance Co., a
powerful black-controlled business in Durham. In 1986, he joined
one of North Carolina's most influential companies, RJR Nabisco
Inc., parent of R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. in Winston-Salem.
</P>
<P>
   Ruffin, Reynolds' vice president of corporate affairs, said he
and his wife, Avon, do not smoke. Neither do their two daughters,
ages 17 and 21. Still he defends their right to do so.

SENATE CONDEMNS INTERNET GAMBLING IN 90-10 VOTE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By STEVE LASH 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Senate voted overwhelmingly Thursday to outlaw
most gambling in cyberspace, casting into legal limbo a burgeoning
$600 million-per-year industry.
</P>
<P>
   By a 90-10 vote, senators approved a measure to extend a federal
ban on interstate betting by telephone or wire to include the
Internet. Before passing the legislation, the Senate rejected,
82-18, an effort to exempt Indian tribes from the prohibition on
Internet wagering.
</P>
<P>
   ``Internet gambling is unregulated, accessible by minors,
addictive, subject to abuse for fraudulent purposes like money
laundering, evasive of state gambling laws _ and already illegal at
the federal level in many cases,'' said Sen. Jon Kyl, R-Ariz.,
chief sponsor of the measure. Permitting an exception for tribes
would render the prohibition meaningless as anybody with a computer
would have access to the Indian casinos, he added.
</P>
<P>
   About $600 million was wagered over the Internet last year,
according to Kyl's office.
</P>
<P>
   The anti-gambling bill, an amendment to pending funding
legislation, contains exceptions that would allow states to conduct
lotteries over the Internet. In addition, off-track-betting on
horse and dog races would be permitted so long as wagers are placed
on subscriber-based computer systems inaccessible to the general
public.
</P>
<P>
   Also permitted under the measure are the popular sports
``fantasy'' or ``rotisserie'' leagues, in which fans create their
own roster of professional athletes and bet on how well their teams
will do. However, the fees Internet sites charge for using these
sites could not be used to pay off bets.
</P>
<P>
   Individuals convicted of running gambling sites on the Internet
could be imprisoned for four years and fined $20,000 or three times
the amount wagered. People found guilty of gambling on the World
Wide Web could be imprisoned for three months and fined $500.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the bill argue the ban is necessary because of the
difficulty in trying to regulate virtual casinos.
</P>
<P>
   The easy access and anonymity for bettors makes it possible for
youngsters who get their hands on a parent's credit cards to run up
debt, they claim.
</P>
<P>
   Representatives from states that have refused to legalize games
of chance expressed concern that residents cannot be prevented from
signing in and placing wagers on sporting events or the turn of a
card in virtual casinos operated from locations thousands of miles
away.
</P>
<P>
   A recent State Department report also criticized foreign
Internet gambling operations in places like Antigua for providing a
haven for money launderers.
</P>
<P>
   Sue Schneider, a spokeswoman for the Internet gambling industry,
assailed the Senate for placing ``a blockade around the U.S.''
while other countries, such as Australia, permit cyberspace
gambling. She also noted with disdain that senators chose to carve
out exceptions for lotteries and parimutuel betting.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really not prohibition; it has exceptions,'' said
Schneider, who chairs the Interactive Gaming Council. ``It's a
little inconsistent.''
</P>
<P>
   The legislation was part of a bill that provided $33.2 million
for the Justice, State and Commerce departments in fiscal year
1999, which begins Oct. 1. The overall spending bill passed 99-0. A
similar measure to outlaw gambling on the Internet is awaiting
action in the House.
</P>
<P>
   Senators who voted against the Kyl bill were Joseph Biden,
D-Del.; Larry Craig, R-Idaho; Thomas Daschle, D-S.D.; Pete
Domenici, R-N.M.; Russell Feingold, D-Minn.; Tom Harkin, D-Iowa;
Daniel Inouye, D-Hawaii; Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y.; Ted
Stevens, R-Alaska; and Paul Wellstone, D-Minn. &QL;

PUERTO RICANS TO MARK 100TH ANNIVERSARY OF US CONTROL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEPHEN KIEHL  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Noemi Price, who has lived in both Puerto Rico and
Massachusetts, will join thousands of other Puerto Ricans gathered
in Washington this weekend to mark the 100th anniversary of US
control over the Carribean island.
</P>
<P>
   But for Price, the hottest topic won't be the past, but instead
the future of her native land.
</P>
<P>
   Price knows what it means to be a full American citizen _ most
importantly, that she can vote in presidential and congressional
elections, something her family back home cannot do.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the president has the power to say, `You people are going
to fight and die for us,' then we should have the right to put that
man in office,'' said Price, 48.
</P>
<P>
   While Saturday's Puerto Rico-USA Centennial Festival on the Mall
in Washington is intended to be a historical commemoration drawing
5,000 to 7,000 people, including some 500 New Englanders,
organizers also hope that it will serve as a political rally for a
Congressionally sanctioned plebiscite on Puerto Rico's status.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are going down there with an agenda _ to fight and let
their voices be heard,'' said Carlos Linera, who favors statehood
and is a liaison in Massachusetts for the Governor's Office of
Puerto Rico.
</P>
<P>
   The question of status _ whether to seek statehood, independence
or remain a US commonwealth _ has divided Puerto Ricans here and on
the island for generations.
</P>
<P>
   In a nonbinding plebiscite in 1993, 48.6 percent of Puerto
Ricans voted for commonwealth status, 46.3 percent for statehood,
and 4.4 percent for independence. &UR;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Under the commonwealth agreement reached in 1952, Puerto Ricans
do not pay federal taxes and cannot vote in U.S. presidential
elections. They have a nonvoting representative in Congress and
they are eligible for the draft and service in the U.S. military.
</P>
<P>
   Statehood supporters say the island's 3.8 million residents
would contribute millions to the U.S. in taxes and Puerto Rico
would be an ideal jumping-off point for trade with Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   Independentistas, those who favor independence, say Puerto Rico
is culturally closer to Latin American than the United States and
will enjoy greater prosperity with political and economic
independence.
</P>
<P>
   In March the US House passed a bill requiring a status
plebiscite in Puerto Rico by the end of the year. Last week,
however, the chairman of the Senate committee hearing testimony on
the bill said it is not likely to get to a full Senate vote anytime
soon.
</P>
<P>
   While those who favor statehood are disappointed with the
delays, Price said they remain optimisic. ``We still have time and
there's a lot of work to be done,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   On July 25, 1898, during the Spanish-American War, the United
Sstates invaded Puerto Rico, then a Spanish colony. The United
States established a military government, and a civilian colonial
administration was set up in 1900.

REP. KENNEDY CITES ABUSES BY US ARMY SCHOOL'S GRADUATES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRIS BLACK  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Representative Joseph P. Kennedy II Thursday
stepped up his campaign against the controversial US training
academy for foreign military officers by releasing a report
detailing new human rights abuses by academy graduates.
</P>
<P>
   The Massachusetts Democrat will try again next week to cut
funding for the School of the Americas, operated by the Army at
Fort Benning, Ga., saying its graduates have committed human rights
violations when they return to their homes in South and Central
America.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've heard a lot of talk about reforming the School of the
Americas, but the evidence continues to mount about a total
disregard for basic human rights and civil rights among its
graduates,'' Kennedy said at a news conference. ``It's time to
bring an end to US taxpayer subsidies of these type of abuses.''
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy released a report compiled by the Latin America Working
Group, a project of the National Council of Churches, which claims
that Colombian graduates of the School of the Americas are among
the principal architects of the escalating human rights crisis in
that country.
</P>
<P>
   The US State Department said that 69 percent of the 3,500
political deaths in Colombia last year were committed by
paramilitary organizations that operate in complicity with the
military. The report said 124 of the 247 military personnel cited
as responsible for human rights violations, which include murders,
kidnappings, disappearances and torture, were graduates of the
School of the Americas.
</P>
<P>
   Captain Kevin McIver, a spokesman for the school, told The
Associated Press that its instructors teach Army doctrine, as
mandated by law, along with courses on democratization and human
rights. He said the school should not be held accountable for the
actions of each of its nearly 60,000 graduates.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's not an institution out there that doesn't have a
graduate who has gone astray,'' McIver said. ``We teach
professionalism, we teach US Army doctrine and we augment it with a
very demanding human rights program.''
</P>
<P>
   Providing graphic testimony at Kennedy's news conference was
Richard Velez, a Colombian television cameraman who was granted
political asylum by the United States last week. Velez said he was
beaten by the Colombian military when he videotaped soldiers
attacking and shooting at a group of peasants during a peaceful
demonstration two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy played the videotape at the news conference.
</P>
<P>
   Velez said he was forced to flee last October after members of
the 20th military brigade attempted to kidnap him. He left his wife
and two children in Colombia and said he fears for their safety.
The brigade is headed by Paucelino Latorre Gamboa, a graduate of
the School of the Americas.
</P>
<P>
   Last year 99 Colombian military officers were students at the
school.

<P>
   Raytheon Co. Thursday posted record quarterly sales and profits
on the strength of its growing electronics and aircraft businesses,
but warned that its struggling engineering unit won't recover soon.
</P>
<P>
   The midday warning to analysts was enough to cause Raytheon's
Class B shares to give back an early gain as some analysts said
they now plan to cut their earnings estimates for the year.
</P>
<P>
   Raytheon Class B shares closed at 58 13/16, down 1/4, after
hitting a 52-week high of 60 3/4 earlier in the day. &UR;  &LR; Class B
shares are the shares that existed before Raytheon issued 103
million new shares last December to pay for its purchase of General
Motors Corp.'s Hughes Aircraft business.
</P>
<P>
   The Lexington, Mass. defense and technology company said net
profits for the quarter rose 29 percent, to $269.5 million, or 79
cents a share. A year ago, Raytheon earned $209.5 million, or 88
cents a share. Although absolute profits rose, per-share earnings
fell because the number of shares outstanding grew 40 percent after
the Hughes transaction.
</P>
<P>
   The results include several one-time gains and charges that
resulted in a boost to earnings of about $7 million, or 2 cents a
share. Without those special items, Raytheon's earnings were $262.6
million, or 77 cents a share. Analysts had been expecting profits
of 76 cents, according to a surveyed by First Call Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Sales for the period soared 53 percent to $5.1 billion,
reflecting the additional revenues from Hughes and the defense
business of Texas Instruments Inc., which Raytheon acquired in July
1997. In the second quarter of last year, Raytheon had $3.3 billion
in sales.
</P>
<P>
   Raytheon's defense and commercial electronics business, as well
as its Beech and Hawker jet business, had strong performances, but
its Raytheon Engineers &AMP; Constructors unit, which builds power
plants and other large infrastructure projects around the world,
continues to struggle.
</P>
<P>
   Although sales increased 9 percent from a year ago, the unit
continued to experience a delay in new orders, which led to
lower-than-expected profit margins for the quarter. Operating
income for the unit was $30 million _ the same as last quarter _
and 33 percent below the year-ago period.
</P>
<P>
   Raytheon has already taken steps to scale back its engineering
business, eliminating about 1,500 jobs since December. But company
officials hinted that additional layoffs might be necessary to
bring down costs because of lowered revenue expectations.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, Raytheon chairman and chief executive Dennis J.
Picard said the company is ``reassessing the structure and
operations of RE&AMP;C while implementing previously announced cost
reduction initiatives.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked later whether additional layoffs were likely, chief
financial officer Peter D'Angelo said, ``We're in the process of
assessing that.''
</P>
<P>
   D'Angelo added that Daniel Burnham, the company's new president,
will spend the next couple of months reviewing the engineering
unit's operations before making any decisions about the future of
the business.
</P>
<P>
   ``He will spend some time getting his arms around the business,
with an eye toward geting that business right-sized and operating
at a cost-effective manner,'' D'Angelo said.
</P>
<P>
   Among the options that Raytheon has said it will consider is
whether to sell a portion of the engineering business to the public
as a way to increase shareholder value.

COURT CLEARS WAY FOR ELECTRICITY DEREGULATION VOTE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GREGG KRUPA  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Setting the stage for a battle this autumn over the
ongoing deregulation of the state's electricity industry, the
Supreme Judicial Court Thursday cleared the way for a referendum on
the restructuring which is criticized by some consumers' groups as
overly generous to utilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is accountability time for the electric light companies,
based on the decision today,'' said John J. O'Connor, chairman of
the Campaign for Fair Electric Rates. ``The restructuring of an
electricity industry does not happen every year, and it ought to be
done right.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of the positive things that could go forward in the
state's attempt to deregulate the industry are frozen by this
referendum,'' said Steve Cowell, president of Conservation
Services, which wants to pursue the current reforms approved by the
Legislature and Acting Governor Paul Cellucci. ``Power plants are
not being sold, competitors who enter the state are not because the
situation is unclear.''
</P>
<P>
   The SJC rejected a challenge to the referendum spearheaded by
business and industry groups that argued that because the new law
involves appropriations to ``state institutions,'' the referendum
is barred by the state Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   But the court ruled that the two agencies in question are not
``state institutions'' as envisioned by the Constitutional
Convention of 1917-18. The court said that the Massachusetts
Renewable Energy Trust Fund and the Community Antenna Television
Commission are both essentially independent agencies.
</P>
<P>
   ``The framers reasoned that the exclusion (of referenda
involving appropriations) was necessary,'' Associate Justice Neil
Lynch wrote for the court. ``This reasoning, however, does not
apply...to special public corporations created for a particular
public purpose.''
</P>
<P>
   The referendum will now appear on the ballot in November, having
survived challenges over its constitutionality and whether voters'
signatures were properly gathered. The court ruled last month that
the process of gathering signatures was valid.
</P>
<P>
   Officials of the Associated Industries of Massachusetts, which
spearheaded the lawsuit aimed at heading off the referendum, were
not available for comment Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign before the November vote is expected to be
dominated by heavily financed interests representing the utilities
and business and industry against some consumer and environmental
groups that think the current deregulation scheme is too expensive
and does not do enough to assure that utilities are burning clean
fuel.
</P>
<P>
   Not all consumer or environmental groups want to tinker with the
deregulation, however, which was the product of years of
negotiations among utilities, the Legislature, the Weld and
Cellucci administrations, environmentalists and consumer groups.
The Conservation Law Foundation and the New England Aquarium, for
example, have joined an umbrella group called Keep the Electric
Rate Reductions that is expected to help campaign against repealing
the law.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the debate between the opposing sides concerns what to
do with so-called stranded costs that occurred when utilities made
spending decisions before deregulation.
</P>
<P>
   ``They looked for the best way to lower those costs, and it was
decided that it was for the utilities to divest themselves of some
good assets, sell them, and use the profits to write down the bad
assets,'' Cowell said. ``It took a year and a half to get the
utilities to agree to that, and the results have been stunning.
We've gotten rid of more stranded costs than any state in the
nation that is considering utility deregulation.''
</P>
<P>
   But those who oppose the current deregulation scheme disagree,
saying that it should have saved consumers as much as three times
the currently projected savings of $10 million this year, and that
the law does nothing to encourage utilities to rid themselves of
polluting plants.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an electricity utility bill,'' said O'Connor, who also
is running for Congress in the Eighth District. ``They spent over
$3 million on lobbying the Legislature to get their version of the
law into practice and probably an additional $1 million in
contributions to senators and reps.''

<P>
   PAILIN, Cambodia _ The world doesn't understand Pol Pot, Col.
Seng Narin said as he leaned back on his front stoop, slipping his
feet comfortably in and out of his sandals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually, the top leaders of the Khmer Rouge were fine,'' he
said. ``It was the lower ranks that engaged in excesses. That's why
we all got such a bad reputation.''
</P>
<P>
   The colonel's wife agreed. ``The leader must take
responsibility,'' she said, ``but sometimes he can't know
everything that is going on. Pol Pot got blamed whether he did
anything wrong or not. There were bad people who hated him and
killed on their own and claimed the orders came from Pol Pot.''
</P>
<P>
   This is not politically correct talk in Cambodia. Nearly
everyone in this country, whatever their differences, agrees on the
evil of Pol Pot. But Pailin, a muddy gem-mining town in the far
northwest of the country is not an ordinary place. It is home to
some 25,000 Khmer Rouge defectors who are consolidating an
autonomous zone _ surrounded by the thick jungles that protected
them during their 16-year insurgency _ with their own government,
economy, police force and army of 5,000 soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   Residents here will take part in the general election July 26,
and the defectors' handpicked candidate is virtually certain to win
the Pailin seat in the National Assembly _ a Khmer Rouge toehold in
any new government.
</P>
<P>
   Pol Pot died in April, and the last three Khmer Rouge leaders
who have refused to defect are on the run with no more than a
handful of armed men. The Khmer Rouge, who caused more than a
million deaths when they ruled the country from 1975 to 1979, are a
spent force.
</P>
<P>
   But in Pailin, under the leadership of Pol Pot's brother-in-law,
Ieng Sary, the residue of that brutal communist movement remains
intact and well organized. Many people fear that it could represent
the nucleus of a new, anti-democratic political force in the
country.
</P>
<P>
   Formally, the defectors have joined the Cambodian mainstream.
Their military commander, Ei Chien, is now the legal governor of
Pailin. Their police officers and soldiers, still under their Khmer
Rouge commanders including Col. Seng Narin, wear new official
uniforms.
</P>
<P>
   No one outside Pailin knows just what these tough former
revolutionaries have in mind. But the arrival among them a month
ago of the movement's five top intellectuals made political
analysts in the capital sit up and take notice.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a fascinating situation,'' a Western diplomat said. ``The
Khmer Rouge may be politically in better shape than they were a few
years ago when they were still fighting the government. They have
managed to have their zone, their income; basically they still have
their army and they have regrouped most of their intellectuals. Not
bad for something that has been defeated and does not exist
anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Forsaking the isolation and austerity of their communist past,
Pailin's leaders have opened their town to the outside world and
are trying to create a civilian economy in place of the warfare
that was once the only pursuit. It is not an easy task. The Thai
border is just seven miles away, but the illegal gem and timber
trade with Thailand that financed the war has dwindled.
</P>
<P>
   And Pailin is suffering from an ailment of other former
communist regimes: its people have little experience in commerce.
</P>
<P>
   Still, they are trying. Minefields have been cleared with the
help of international aid, and a bumpy dirt road has been opened,
connecting Pailin to the nearest city, Battambang, 50 miles east.
</P>
<P>
   A newly opened marketplace is filled with traders from around
the country. Wireless-telephone kiosks, several small gas stations
and even a bank are signs of new links to a world that the Khmer
Rouge once rejected. Restaurants, tiny hotels, billiard halls and
dozens of brothels have opened in a frontier atmosphere. Even a
gambling hall, the Caesar International Casino, is under
construction, though it is not clear who will travel this far to
use it.
</P>
<P>
   In tin-roofed karaoke parlors, idle young men _ former Khmer
Rouge soldiers _ sing along with sentimental Cambodian love songs
late into the night. There is an innocence about these young men,
who have known much more of killing than romance.
</P>
<P>
   Pailin's leaders offer a smiling face to visitors. They readily
admit their failures, though they insist that they personally took
no part in the Khmer Rouge killings.
</P>
<P>
   ``National reconciliation and an end to the war: that is our
main policy,'' said Ieng Vuth, deputy governor of Pailin and the
son of Ieng Sary, who was the first Khmer Rouge leader to defect,
here in Pailin, nearly two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Please tell the West, don't think too much about the Khmer
Rouge,'' Ieng Vuth said. ``There is no more Khmer Rouge. The Khmer
Rouge have become ghosts now. It's over.''
</P>
<P>
   But there are many people in Cambodia who fear the power of
ghosts. The country remains violent and unstable _ a legacy of the
Khmer Rouge years _ and the current election could produce a
contested result that would lead to still more infighting. In the
months or years to come, there may be new openings for a reinvented
and rejuvenated Khmer Rouge to reassert itself, with a new name and
a new political philosophy.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Any political rebirth may well involve the most recent defectors
to Pailin, the five leading ideologues of the Khmer Rouge, who
joined their old friends here June 11. In an interview, three of
these French-trained elders _ Chan Youran, In Sopheap and Kor Bun
Heng _ offered a display of erudition and graciousness that seemed
intended to show that they could not have been party to any
thuggery.
</P>
<P>
   Apologizing for the absence of champagne, Chan Youran, 62, who
held a number of official positions with the Khmer Rouge, raised a
glass of water and said: ``My friend, let us talk frankly. We are
here in Pailin not to form a Khmer Rouge movement like in the past.
We think honestly the Khmer Rouge is dead as a movement, as an
ideology, a communist ideology.''
</P>
<P>
   He and his comrades offered a series of personal defenses: they
had had no idea of the extent of the killings; they were out of the
country for much of the time; they were intellectuals, not
policy-makers; they had done what they could to soften the system
from within; they, too, lost family members in the killing fields.
</P>
<P>
   ``After the liberation in 1975 by the Khmer Rouge,'' Chan Youran
said, ``we intellectuals, we continued to reject the communist
ideology, the communist regime. We wanted national unity, not class
struggle. But as you know full well, we were only intellectuals,
not leaders. This was the great dilemma for all of us, for 30
years, until now.''
</P>
<P>
   Even today, the men said, they remain ignorant of events. They
said they had no idea of the status of the three remaining leaders
_ Ta Mok, Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan _ whose ranks they fled only
weeks ago. Nor did they admit to any firsthand knowledge of the
circumstances of the death of Pol Pot, who is said to have suffered
a heart attack. They didn't even know him very well, they said.
</P>
<P>
   Many ordinary Cambodians joined the Khmer Rouge in the 1960s and
'70s with ideals of nationalism, or out of anger over Vietnamese
incursions and U.S. bombing. They found themselves committed to a
revolution that took a dreadful turn.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were fighting for our country's independence and against
the Vietnamese aggressors,'' said Nuon Nim, 51, a former Khmer
Rouge soldier who is now a schoolteacher here. ``But our leaders
took us step by step into a swamp, and we were stuck there and
could not escape.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the political designs of Pailin's leaders, most people
here say they have had enough of armed conflict. They support
themselves as best they can, scratching for rubies and sapphires in
the mostly exhausted gem mines or selling one another vegetables in
the market. Like others interviewed here, Nuon Nim said his
ambitions were modest: a chance to earn a living in peace.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't need to bring an orchestra to play for us to make
us happy,'' he said.

`MUNSTERS' CO-STAR TRIES TO UPSTAGE INCUMBENT IN N.Y. CAMPAIGN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN CAHER  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Wired, wrinkled and wily, Al ``Grandpa Munster''
Lewis took his campaign for governor to the state capital Thursday,
upstaging his running mate's criminal justice platform with a
typically theatrical _ and occasionally substantive _ performance.
</P>
<P>
   The onetime co-star of the 1960s television series, ``The
Munsters,'' Lewis, 88, amused a small crowd with persistent
references to Gov. George Pataki as ``George Potato Head Pataki''
and insinuations that reporters are ineducable.
</P>
<P>
   But he seemed to stumble a bit when pressed on exactly what he
would do to help the poor and middle class, except feed New York
legislators to sharks.
</P>
<P>
   After considerable prodding, Lewis said he would heavily tax
Wall Street moguls to raise money for the underclass, reform
campaign finance laws and socialize medicine. But his ``I am my
brother's keeper'' message was almost lost in a rapid-fire flurry
of quips and cracks and savvy sound bites.
</P>
<P>
   ``They say, `How can you talk about the governor that way?'''
Lewis said, his face contorted around an unlit all-day cigar.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I beg your pardon,'' the Green Party candidate said
sarcastically. ``I didn't know he was the Duke of Windsor. I didn't
know he was Lord Montbatten ... The year before he was nominated
... if you and I went to the 10 largest cities in the state of New
York and interviewed 600,000 people, we wouldn't find one person
who ever heard of George Potato Head Pataki! It's a fact. He was
extracted from a junkyard by the number one junk keeper, Alfonse _
he doesn't like that name, he lists himself as `Al' _ Pothole
D'Amato.''
</P>
<P>
   Pataki is a Republican and D'Amato is the Republican senator.
Both men are running for re-election this year.
</P>
<P>
   While Lewis stole the show and played to the cameras at a press
conference, his running mate, Alice Green of Albany, and senatorial
candidate Joel Kovel strived to generate some interest in their
plan to overhaul New York's criminal justice system, repeal the
harsh Rockefeller drug laws and shift the focus of officialdom from
street crimes to white-collar offenses.
</P>
<P>
   Green views criminal justice issues largely in shades of black
and white, and contends that a racist system and racist society is
intent on warehousing minorities in prison instead of dealing with
core causes of crime.
</P>
<P>
   She called ``Jenna's Law'' _ a measure to limit parole for
``violent'' first time offenders _ a ``purely emotional reaction''
to the murder of a young Albany nursing student and criticized the
Assembly for caving in to political demands.
</P>
<P>
   Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver, D-Manhattan, has opposed the
measure and refused to allow a vote before the Legislature
adjourned last month. However, after weeks of pounding by
Republicans, Silver announced that he will call the Assembly back
to pass Jenna's Law.
</P>
<P>
   One letter issued by state Republicans included nine photographs
of violent criminals, with the caption: ``These violent rapists,
killers and child molesters will soon be out on the street again
... all because of one man: Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver.''
</P>
<P>
   Green and Kovel said the poster was overtly racist.
</P>
<P>
   ``It almost has a lynch-mob quality about it,'' Green said.
``The suggestion is that only blacks or Latinos commit these
horrendous crimes.''
</P>
<P>
   Terry O'Brien, spokesman for the state GOP, noted that six of
the nine defendants whose mug shots were included with the letter
are Caucasian. He said Green's charges are offensive, and compared
her political tactics to those of Alton Maddox Jr. and C. Vernon
Mason, advisers to Tawana Brawley.
</P>
<P>
   A jury recently found that Maddox and Mason, black activists,
along with the Rev. Al Sharpton, had exploited a black teen-ager's
fake rape claims to smear the reputation of a white prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
   The Green Party is hoping that Lewis' celebrity will attract at
least 50,000 votes, which would give the group a line on the ballot
for the next four years. Without official sanction from the state,
the Greens cannot run candidates without going through the costly
and cumbersome process of mounting a petition drive.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis said his candidacy will draw to the polls people who
usually don't bother to vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``I appeal to the largest bloc of voters in the state of New
York and none of you know what it is, so I will tell you!'' Lewis
bellowed. ``It's the embarrassing number of 60 percent who don't
vote.''

HOUSE OVERRIDES CLINTON VETO OF `PARTIAL BIRTH' ABORTION BILL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., Ill.)  (lh) 
 By LIZETTE ALVAREZ   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Replicating last year's vote, the House voted
Thursday to override President Clinton's 1997 veto of a bill that
would ban the late-term abortion procedure that opponents call
partial-birth abortion.
</P>
<P>
   Attention now shifts to the Senate, where abortion opponents
fell three votes short last year of the two-thirds majority needed
to override Clinton's veto. The Senate is expected to take up the
issue in September, two months before the November elections.
</P>
<P>
   Looking ahead to the vote, abortion opponents said they had
intensified their lobbying, focusing much of their efforts on the
handful of senators who are considered vulnerable on the abortion
vote.
</P>
<P>
   In what seemed a virtual repeat of last year's showdown, House
members voted 296-132 Thursday to override the veto, 10 more than
is needed. It was the same number that approved the ban last
October. On Thursday, eight Republicans voted against the override
and 77 Democrats chose to support it, with Democrats picking up one
member who opposes the ban. Rep. Gregory Meeks, D-N.Y., who
succeeded Rep. Floyd Flake when he retired in 1997, voted against
the override.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would ban the abortion procedure, known medically as
intact dilation and extraction, except when needed to save the
pregnant woman's life. Clinton opposes the bill because it does not
include a broad exception to protect a woman's health.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats lost ground on the issue last year when a doctor
admitted that he had lied in stating that the abortion procedure
was seldom used and only as a last resort. Then, after the American
Medical Association endorsed the ban, support flagged further. On
Thursday, Republicans did not hesitate to remind C-Span viewers of
those two points. And they did not shy from delving into the
explicit details of the abortion, which they say is never needed
because alternate methods can be used.
</P>
<P>
   During the procedure, the fetus is partly delivered, then its
skull is suctioned and collapsed so the rest of the body can be
moved into the birth canal. Surveys show that many people feel
uncomfortable about late-term abortions, even those who back
abortion rights.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., who heads the House Judiciary Committee
and who has likened abortion to slavery in its debasement of human
life, closed the debate to the applause of his Republican
colleagues by saying:
</P>
<P>
   ``That little almost-born baby whose arms and legs are flailing,
whose little chest harbors a beating heart, is a human being with
human rights even if his or her human life can be snuffed out by
the plunge of the abortionist's surgical scissor into the back of
the tiny neck. Health versus a life. You are trading apples and
oranges, chickens and horses. If you put those on the scale, life
weighs heavier.''
</P>
<P>
   Many Democrats said Thursday that they did not endorse the
procedure, either. But, they said, they are not willing to
``trample'' on a woman's constitutional right to choose abortion,
as one member put it, to outlaw a procedure that is sometimes used
to protect a woman's health. The decision of which procedure to
use, they said, is best left to the doctor and the patient, not
Congress.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In general, Democrats who voted for the override say that the
procedure is abhorrent and that its restriction would have no
practical impact on abortion in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Showing renewed vigor, Democrats worked hard on Thursday to make
Republicans look like extremists for not taking a woman's health
into consideration. The Democrats also pointed out that 17 court
decisions had struck down similar bans enacted by states, and that
two others had limited them, illustrating their
unconstitutionality. But such a ban has been upheld by a federal
appeals court based in Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats also made it plain _ as did some abortion opponents _
that this was simply the first step in a long battle to outlaw
abortion.
</P>
<P>
   ``The GOP leadership has been waging war on abortion rights
since taking over this House in 1994,'' said Rep. Nita Lowey,
D-N.Y.. ``This is the 93rd vote on reproductive rights in less than
three years. The message is, let's ban every abortion, month by
month, procedure by procedure.''

CLINTON ANNOUNCES RELEASE OF $100 MILLION TO AID DROUGHT-STRICKEN
STATES

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Promising money for air conditioners and relief for
farmers, the Clinton administration Thursday moved to aid states
tormented by an unrelenting heat wave that has cost lives and
destroyed crops.
</P>
<P>
   The president announced the release of $100 million in federal
emergency funds to 11 states for low-income people to help them buy
air conditioners and fans or pay electric bills.
</P>
<P>
   The White House says the states that will receive aid are
Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, North
Carolina, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Tennessee and Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton declared all Texas counties eligible for disaster
assistance, making federal loans available to farmers whose crops
have been damaged by drought.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said that Texas will immediately receive $32,722,551
from the Low Income Home Energy Assistance program, which is
better-known for helping poor people in northern climates pay their
heating bills in winter.
</P>
<P>
   ``When blizzards and high-energy costs put elderly and poor
citizens at risk, we step in. When smothering heat threatens the
lives of people, we can step in, and that is what I am doing
today,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas Department of Housing and Community Affairs will
receive the money and then disperse it to community organizations
around the state that work with low-income people.
</P>
<P>
   To qualify for the emergency assistance, state officials said a
family of four has to earn no more than $20,563 a year or an
individual no more than $10,063.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   In Austin, Texas Gov. George W. Bush thanked Clinton for the
help, but warned Texans that the heat's toll on lives and property
was far from over.
</P>
<P>
   ``Texas heat has become a deadly furnace. Scorching temperatures
and the ongoing lack of rain have cost lives, livestock and
livelihoods,'' said Bush, who joined several other state officials
to provide an update on the emergency.
</P>
<P>
   State health commissioner William R. ``Reyn'' Archer said at
least 80 people in Texas, including illegal immigrants crossing the
border from Mexico, have died as a result of the heat wave.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Agriculture Commissioner Rick Perry said the state's
farming industry, under a ``best case scenario,'' will lose $1.5
billion.
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials have estimated that more than 14 million acres
of crops in Texas have been damaged by the drought, with claims for
federal crop insurance expected to be as high as $700 million.
</P>
<P>
   The $32 million in federal emergency aid should buy plenty of
fans and air conditioners for poor people who are struggling to
survive in dangerously hot homes and apartments.
</P>
<P>
   Bush estimated that each $1 million would buy 10,000
air-conditioning units, which he said ``will put a huge dent in
solving the problem.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(END OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   While the federal aid was being welcomed in Texas, the
assistance program has been a political football in Washington,
where Sun Belt lawmakers have regularly attacked it as unnecessary.
</P>
<P>
   House Republicans have so far refused to appropriate any money
in next year's budget for energy assistance, ignoring a Clinton
request for $1.1 billion in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The president used the announcement of the emergency money as an
opportunity to chastise the House leadership for trying to kill the
program.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Congress proceeds to try and eliminate all funding for this
vital emergency assistance, it would be an act of political
irresponsibility,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Some lawmakers said they will try to restore the program's funds
when the full House votes on the appropriations bill. The Senate
also is not expected to go along with eliminating the program.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Barry Bitzer, a spokesman for Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, said
the Texas Republican had supported funding for the energy
assistance program in the past.
</P>
<P>
   Bitzer added that Hutchison ``welcomes any assistance the
president is able to give our farmers, ranchers and others
suffering from this terrible heat wave.''

   Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman is scheduled to tour
drought-stricken farms from Oklahoma to Texas next week and hold a
round-table discussion with agriculture experts at Texas A&AMP;M
University in College Station on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, urged Glickman to expedite the loan
process, saying that some farmers have complained to him that it
often takes as long as 18 months to receive the loans.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an emergency that requires an urgent response, not
business as usual,'' Gramm said in a written statement.
</P>
<P>
   Undersecretary of Agriculture August Schumacher responded, ``I
strongly disagree with Sen. Gramm that this will take 18 months.
Our offices are open for farmers to visit and to begin the paper
work.''
</P>
<P>
   Schumacher said that it should take no more than six weeks for
farmers to obtain the 3.75 percent loans once they have completed
their applications.
</P>
<P>
   But before the application process can proceed, he said, farmers
must provide proof of a 30 percent crop loss. Such evidence usually
can only be supplied during harvest season.

`MUNSTERS' CO-STAR TRIES TO UPSTAGE INCUMBENT IN N.Y. CAMPAIGN 
</HEADLINE>
   (EDs: Also filed in ``a'' category)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN CAHER  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Wired, wrinkled and wily, Al ``Grandpa Munster''
Lewis took his campaign for governor to the state capital Thursday,
upstaging his running mate's criminal justice platform with a
typically theatrical _ and occasionally substantive _ performance.
</P>
<P>
   The onetime co-star of the 1960s television series, ``The
Munsters,'' Lewis, 88, amused a small crowd with persistent
references to Gov. George Pataki as ``George Potato Head Pataki''
and insinuations that reporters are ineducable.
</P>
<P>
   But he seemed to stumble a bit when pressed on exactly what he
would do to help the poor and middle class, except feed New York
legislators to sharks.
</P>
<P>
   After considerable prodding, Lewis said he would heavily tax
Wall Street moguls to raise money for the underclass, reform
campaign finance laws and socialize medicine. But his ``I am my
brother's keeper'' message was almost lost in a rapid-fire flurry
of quips and cracks and savvy sound bites.
</P>
<P>
   ``They say, `How can you talk about the governor that way?'''
Lewis said, his face contorted around an unlit all-day cigar.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I beg your pardon,'' the Green Party candidate said
sarcastically. ``I didn't know he was the Duke of Windsor. I didn't
know he was Lord Montbatten ... The year before he was nominated
... if you and I went to the 10 largest cities in the state of New
York and interviewed 600,000 people, we wouldn't find one person
who ever heard of George Potato Head Pataki! It's a fact. He was
extracted from a junkyard by the number one junk keeper, Alfonse _
he doesn't like that name, he lists himself as `Al' _ Pothole
D'Amato.''
</P>
<P>
   Pataki is a Republican and D'Amato is the Republican senator.
Both men are running for re-election this year.
</P>
<P>
   While Lewis stole the show and played to the cameras at a press
conference, his running mate, Alice Green of Albany, and senatorial
candidate Joel Kovel strived to generate some interest in their
plan to overhaul New York's criminal justice system, repeal the
harsh Rockefeller drug laws and shift the focus of officialdom from
street crimes to white-collar offenses.
</P>
<P>
   Green views criminal justice issues largely in shades of black
and white, and contends that a racist system and racist society is
intent on warehousing minorities in prison instead of dealing with
core causes of crime.
</P>
<P>
   She called ``Jenna's Law'' _ a measure to limit parole for
``violent'' first time offenders _ a ``purely emotional reaction''
to the murder of a young Albany nursing student and criticized the
Assembly for caving in to political demands.
</P>
<P>
   Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver, D-Manhattan, has opposed the
measure and refused to allow a vote before the Legislature
adjourned last month. However, after weeks of pounding by
Republicans, Silver announced that he will call the Assembly back
to pass Jenna's Law.
</P>
<P>
   One letter issued by state Republicans included nine photographs
of violent criminals, with the caption: ``These violent rapists,
killers and child molesters will soon be out on the street again
... all because of one man: Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver.''
</P>
<P>
   Green and Kovel said the poster was overtly racist.
</P>
<P>
   ``It almost has a lynch-mob quality about it,'' Green said.
``The suggestion is that only blacks or Latinos commit these
horrendous crimes.''
</P>
<P>
   Terry O'Brien, spokesman for the state GOP, noted that six of
the nine defendants whose mug shots were included with the letter
are Caucasian. He said Green's charges are offensive, and compared
her political tactics to those of Alton Maddox Jr. and C. Vernon
Mason, advisers to Tawana Brawley.
</P>
<P>
   A jury recently found that Maddox and Mason, black activists,
along with the Rev. Al Sharpton, had exploited a black teen-ager's
fake rape claims to smear the reputation of a white prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
   The Green Party is hoping that Lewis' celebrity will attract at
least 50,000 votes, which would give the group a line on the ballot
for the next four years. Without official sanction from the state,
the Greens cannot run candidates without going through the costly
and cumbersome process of mounting a petition drive.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis said his candidacy will draw to the polls people who
usually don't bother to vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``I appeal to the largest bloc of voters in the state of New
York and none of you know what it is, so I will tell you!'' Lewis
bellowed. ``It's the embarrassing number of 60 percent who don't
vote.''

DOW PLUNGES 195.93 POINTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By SHARON R. KING    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ While second-quarter corporate earnings have come in
largely better than expected, a smattering of disappointing reports
and renewed fears about Asia sent stocks reeling Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average plunged 195.93 points, or 2.15
percent, to 8,932,98, its first close below 9,000 since June 30.
The blue-chip measure has fallen more than 400 points from its high
of 9,337.97 on last Friday. Thursday's free fall was the
third-sharpest drop in the Dow this year, after a 2.34 percent
decline on June 15 and a 2.85 percent drop on Jan. 9.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing led the decline, falling 6.75 and accounting for 27.8
points of the Dow's rout, after reporting lower than expected
earnings.
</P>
<P>
   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index dove 24.33 points, or 2.09
percent, to 1,139.75. Microsoft, whose giant market capitalization
gives it enormous clout in the index, was the leading decliner,
falling 3.75 points to 113. The one-day fall wiped off $9.2 billion
of the company's market value.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq composite index fared better. It closed down 34.53
points, or 1.75 percent, at 1,935.22.
</P>
<P>
   In recent days, a diverse group of companies, including Merck,
McDonald's, Coca-Cola and DuPont, have cautioned investors that
earnings in the second half of the year could falter in part
because of the continuing economic crisis in Asia. For some of
these companies, the red flag was the first this year, leading
stock analysts and investors to fret about how long the Asian flu
will persist.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing said Thursday that second-quarter earnings fell 46
percent, to $258 million, or 26 cents a diluted share _ sharply
lower than analysts' estimates of 33 cents a share. The company
also warned that results for this year and next would be
substantially weaker than Wall Street forecasts.
</P>
<P>
   Although Sears, Roebuck &AMP; Co. reported Thursday that profits
rose 2.3 percent on strong sales, its stock fell 5.375 to 51 5/16
on continuing worries about its credit card business. Delinquencies
are high, and the company anticipates a 15 percent decline in
earnings at the unit for the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``One day it's Merck, the next day it's Disney and then it's
Boeing,'' said Marshall Acuff, equity strategist with Salomon Smith
Barney. ``People are starting to say, `If the best of the market
can't do it, who can?'''
</P>
<P>
   Investors were also rattled by two days of congressional
testimony by Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, who warned
that the Asian crisis was far from over and that the stock market
could fall sharply at some point.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think people were listening to the Fed chairman, and he was
right,'' said Charles Johnson, head equity trader at Blaylock &AMP;
Partners in Baltimore. ``These valuations are not sustainable in
terms of earnings.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Before profit reports began in earnest in mid-July, stock
analysts forecast a 1.3 percent increase in earnings for the
companies in the S&AMP;P 500 in the second quarter. In the first
quarter, earnings grew 3.8 percent for the companies in the index.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 333 index members that have reported thus far, the
earnings of 202 firms, or 60 percent, exceeded analysts' forecasts.
That number is slightly above the average of 55 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, only 13 percent, or 44 firms, reported earnings
that were below forecasts, according to First Call Corp., a Boston
research company that tracks analysts estimates. That number is
below the 25 percent average for such negative reports. Based on
those figures, earnings are now expected to grow 4.1 percent in the
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   But companies are exceeding estimates that have already been
ratcheted down sharply by analysts. At the beginning of the year,
growth in earnings a share for the S&AMP;P 500 in the second quarter
was forecast at 12.9 percent. The forecast dropped sharply to 6.1
percent in April and then to just 1.3 percent, according to First
Call data.
</P>
<P>
   ``We made it pretty easy to meet or beat expectations,'' said
Robert Froehlich, chief investment strategist at Scudder Kemper
Investments. ``If you lower the bar enough, even I can jump over
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Adding to investors' concerns about Asia was a warning from
credit rating agency Moody's Investors Service that it might lower
its ratings on some Japanese government debt.
</P>
<P>
   It said it was reviewing the government's high-grade credit
rating on yen and foreign currency-denominated debt and bank
deposits due to ``deep structural problems in Japan's economy that
have defied conventional policy remedies.'' &QL;

 &HT;    Closed meeting draws fire from wary Gulf War vets
 &HT;    By Arthur Brice
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- Some veterans complained Thursday that a special
presidential oversight panel on Gulf War illnesses held closed
meetings last week without informing or inviting them.
</P>
<P>
   After frequent accusations from veterans in the past few years
that the Pentagon was not doing enough to investigate Gulf War
illnesses, President Clinton appointed the seven-member panel in
February to oversee the Defense Department's probe into what might
be afflicting more than 100,000 soldiers. The presidential panel,
chaired by former New Hampshire Republican Sen. Warren Rudman, held
its first meetings July 16 and 17.
</P>
<P>
   Rudman's panel heard from Bernard Rostker, special presidential
assistant for Gulf War illnesses, and members of his investigative
team. That has caused consternation among some Gulf War veterans,
who say they don't trust Rostker and the Pentagon's probe.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Rostker is giving Rudman's panel information that is
inaccurate, then Rudman's panel has started off on the wrong
foot,'' said Paul Sullivan, executive director of the National Gulf
War Resource Center, which represents 53 veterans groups.
</P>
<P>
   But the Pentagon said Thursday that Rostker and his team were
just bringing the panel, known officially as the Special Oversight
Board for the Department of Defense Investigation for Gulf War
Chemical and Biological Incidents, up to speed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were just trying to tell them what we do,'' said Lt. Col.
Dian Lawhon, who is Rostker's spokeswoman. ``It wasn't like we were
trying to sell them a bill of goods.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like an anatomy course before you go into surgery,''
said Roger Kaplan, deputy executive director for the oversight
board.
</P>
<P>
   Many veterans have acrimonious feelings toward the Pentagon
because the Defense Department at first insisted after the 1991
Gulf War that soldiers' symptoms were not from any service-related
illness. The veterans criticize the Pentagon as grudging and slow
in recognizing the soldiers' afflictions.
</P>
<P>
   Now, veterans say they're upset because they weren't invited to
the panel's meeting and didn't know about it until a week after it
was held.
</P>
<P>
   ``This raises very grave concerns among veterans about the true
intent of Pentagon efforts to investigate Gulf War illnesses,''
Sullivan said.
</P>
<P>
   But Rudman said Thursday that he was just holding an
organizational session to find out what the Pentagon has been
doing.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was strictly an informational meeting,'' Rudman said.
``It was not a public meeting. There will be public meetings. All
of our hearings will be public.''
</P>
<P>
   The panel expects to hold its first public hearing in late
September or early October, Kaplan said.
</P>
<P>
   But first, Rudman said, panel members had to get to know each
other.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't do that in front of a thousand people in an
auditorium,'' Rudman said. ``I had never met these people. We had
never met each other before.''
</P>
<P>
   Rudman said he obtained legal advice from the Pentagon's general
counsel's office to make sure the group would not violate any laws
by holding the closed-door meeting.
</P>
<P>
   That misses the point, Sullivan countered.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may not be illegal,'' he said, ``but we don't need secret
meetings when Rostker has such a bad record of not telling the
truth.''
</P>
<P>
   Rudman dismissed Sullivan's complaints as baseless.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're entitled to say whatever they want,'' Rudman said. ``I
happen to believe in the First Amendment. But that happens to be
poppycock.''

RECORDS OF GOLD STOLEN FROM JEWS SAID TO BE GONE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By ALAN COWELL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN _ In a twist to the Nazi gold saga, German officials
acknowledged Thursday that 26 crucial, secret files containing
records of gold stolen from Jews in concentration camps had
mysteriously disappeared from German archives long after World War
II.
</P>
<P>
   The discovery raised several questions about the fate of the
documents, including the possibility that they had been
deliberately destroyed to cover the tracks of former Nazi banking
officials entrusted by the Allies with high offices in postwar
Germany.
</P>
<P>
   The development could prove a setback to efforts by Holocaust
survivors to reinforce claims against German and Swiss banks for
wartime losses.
</P>
<P>
   News of the documents' disappearance emerged from an unpublished
report by the Federal Archives office here, German officials said.
The report covered the archives' abortive efforts last year to
provide U.S. investigators with details of the files, which, among
other features, tally the amounts of dental gold delivered to
Berlin after it had been pried from the mouths of Jews at
Auschwitz.
</P>
<P>
   The files were named for Bruno Melmer, a notorious SS officer
whose job from 1942 to 1945 was to amass personal gold and jewelry
stolen from Jews in Auschwitz and other death camps, part of a
widespread effort to accumulate looted gold to finance Hitler's war
effort.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest part of the gold was sold to the Swiss National Bank
in return for convertible Swiss francs that were used to buy raw
materials to make munitions. A report by a panel of Swiss
historians this year said that Nazi Germany stole gold worth $146
million at wartime prices _ the figure today would be nine times as
much _ from individuals, including Jews, and plundered a further
$475 million at wartime prices from the central banks of occupied
lands.
</P>
<P>
   The figures are significant because claims against Swiss
institutions by Holocaust survivors have brought a deepening crisis
to Swiss banks. The banks are facing the threat of U.S. sanctions
because negotiations on compensation for Holocaust survivors
collapsed last month.
</P>
<P>
   The German report chronicled a series of lapses by German and
American officials in safeguarding the documents. ``To outside
observers it will seem incomprehensible that documents so closely
linked to the crimes of Nazism could be distributed so carelessly
and finally lost,'' the report said, according to a German official
who insisted on anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   The files were located in 1945 by American troops in eastern
Germany. The report said the documents were shipped to the United
States, where some were microfilmed. But sections, apparently
including the 26 Melmer files, were not.
</P>
<P>
   The documents included the Melmer files and other account books
that tallied gold receipts by the precious metals department of the
Reichsbank, the German Central Bank.
</P>
<P>
   Inexplicably the documents were handed back to the German
authorities in 1948 and left in the care of the Bank Deutscher
Lander, the forerunner of the present German central bank, the
Bundesbank.
</P>
<P>
   A top official at that institution, the report said, was Albert
Thoms, who had headed the Reichsbank department that processed
looted gold and whom the Allies rehabilitated after the war. At
Thoms' death in 1977, his estate was found to include confidential
documents that had been missing from bank archives.

COURT RULING UNDERMINES IRANIAN PRESIDENT'S AUTHORITY

   CAIRO, Egypt _ In a new setback to Iran's president, an Iranian
court on Thursday convicted the mayor of Tehran on charges of
corruption and mismanagement, sentenced him to five years in
prison, and barred him from public office until 2018.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor, Gholamhossein Karabaschi, is a close ally of
president Mohammed Khatami. The trial had widely been seen in Iran
as politically motivated, and the outcome Thursday appeared to have
fulfilled what critics said was its goal: toppling one of the
president's most important lieutenants.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict was a victory for conservatives who had accused
Karabaschi of using his office to benefit Khatami, whose pursuit of
greater political and social freedom in Iran has angered the
country's old guard. It came at a time when political fissures
within Iran have become ever more evident, and in which Khatami's
rivals are trying to gain the upper hand.
</P>
<P>
   In a separate court ruling in Tehran on Thursday, a new
newspaper that had become a bold voice on Khatami's behalf was
ordered to cease publication immediately.
</P>
<P>
   All this happened a day after the disclosure that Iran had
test-fired a new medium-range missile with the power to reach
Israel, an act that served to undermine the conciliatory tone that
Khatami has struck in his own foreign-policy pronouncements.
</P>
<P>
   Together, the new developments suggested just how much power
Iranian conservatives _ the country's dominant political force
since the Islamic revolution of 1979 _ still wield despite
Khatami's landslide victory a year ago over a candidate supported
by that ruling religious establishment.
</P>
<P>
   Although Khatami won the support of nearly 70 percent of Iranian
voters, his authority as president is limited. Since he took office
last August, he has had to contend with repeated muscle-flexing
from rival institutions, including the Parliament, the judiciary,
and the office of the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, all
of which are dominated by far more conservative figures.
</P>
<P>
   In the last month, Khatami has already had to weather the ouster
of one top lieutenant, Interior Minister Abdullah Nouri, who was
impeached by Parliament members who accused him of being too
permissive in allowing student organizations to conduct street
demonstrations. And with Thursday's conviction of Karabaschi and
the court-ordered shuttering of the newspaper, Jameyah, Khatami may
now have to wrestle with whatever chilling effect those steps may
have on other supporters.
</P>
<P>
   Since its founding in February, the newspaper had won many
admirers and a large readership by openly challenging the stances
taken by Khatami's conservative opponents.
</P>
<P>
   But in response to complaints from officials of Iran's powerful
Revolutionary Guard corps, a Tehran court ruled last month that
several of the newspaper's articles had been defamatory and false,
and the order to close was issued after an appeals court upheld
that ruling on Thursday
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, it remained far from clear what role, if any,
Khatami may have played in Iran's decision to test fire the new
missile, which U.S. officials said had a range of about 800 miles
and could strike Israel, Saudi Arabia or U.S. forces in the region.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Under Khatami, the Iranian government has tried to repair
strained ties with its Arab neighbors, and it has muted much of the
anti-U.S. and anti-Israeli sentiment that has long been central to
its public pronouncements.
</P>
<P>
   But that change in tone has not extended to Ayatollah Khamenei,
who retains authority over all of the branches of the Iranian armed
forces and other national security institutions, and who foreign
diplomats in Iran said would almost certainly have had the final
say over any missile test.
</P>
<P>
   In Israel Thursday, Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai said he
regarded any missile testing by Iran as a ``very serious matter''
but did not believe that Iran's missile could reach Israel.
</P>
<P>
   For its part, the Iranian government made no public statements
about the missile test, which Clinton administration officials in
Washington have said was monitored by U.S. spy satellites.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, most attention in Tehran was fixed on Karabaschi, whose
sentence was even harsher than had been urged by his more
vociferous critics. His lawyer, Bahman Keshavarz, said the mayor
would appeal the conviction within the 20 days allowed by law.
Keshavarz said he was ``100 percent certain'' that his client, who
is to remain free on bail until his appeal is heard, would be
vindicated.
</P>
<P>
   But others sympathetic to Karabaschi said the case had raised
clear doubts as to whether the mayor, because of his ties to
Khatami, could ever be treated fairly by judicial officials, who
are most closely aligned with Ayatollah Khamenei.
</P>
<P>
   Karabaschi, who had repeatedly proclaimed his innocence, was
found guilty on charges of embezzlement, mismanagement and misusing
public funds to help elect Khatami during last year's presidential
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``More than ever before, this verdict raises questions about the
independence and credibility of the judiciary,'' Sadq Ziba-Kalam, a
political science professor at Tehran University, said in an
interview in Tehran on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Karabaschi, 45, has served as Tehran's mayor since 1989. He has
won admirers both for pressing a city-wide beautification effort
that has vastly improved the quality of life in the capital and for
his outspokenness on behalf of Khatami during last year's
presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Since judicial officials first brought the charges against him
in April, his case has been a focus of intense public and political
interest.
</P>
<P>
   His imprisonment prompted swift condemnation from Khatami's
government, and prompted a public outcry that soon began to spill
over into street demonstrations. Only after a series of high-level
meetings did Ayatollah Khamenei, in a sign of evident alarm, accept
Khatami's recommendation that the mayor be released on bond.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, Iranians have watched transfixed late into the
evening as proceedings from the twice-a-week public trial were
broadcast in their entirety on the country's state-run television
station.
</P>
<P>
   Karabaschi was not present in court Thursday as the verdict was
read out in the Imam Khomeni Judicial Complex. But large numbers of
police and firefighters were posted outside, apparently to avert
any protest that might have followed the announcement of the
court's decision.
</P>
<P>
   By Thursday evening, there had been no reports of public
demonstrations in response to the verdict, but foreign diplomats
and independent analysts in Iran said they believed a new round of
protests was almost certainly inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict was read by Judge Gholamhossein Mohseni Ejaei, who
under Iranian judicical system has served as both judge and
prosecutor throughout the trial, and whose neutrality Karabaschi
has repeatedly challenged.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the prison sentence and the 20-year-ban on
holding public office, Karabaschi was ordered to pay a fine of
approximately $530,000 and to return to the public treasury the
equivalent of $6 million in what the court said had been misused
funds.
</P>
<P>
   An additional sentence of 60 lashes, imposed in accordance with
Iran's Islamic law, was suspended in what the court said was its
recognition of Karabaschi's high social standing.

LEEDHAM SEEKS TEAMSTERS VOTES IN MASSACHUSETTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE E. LEWIS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CANTON, Mass. _ Teamsters presidential candidate Tom Leedham
Thursday pumped hands, passed out leaflets, and portrayed himself
as a longtime rank and filer who knows more about being a union
worker than his challenger, James P. Hoffa.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our campaign is all about the rank and file,'' Leedham, 47, of
Oregon, said in an interview. ``Hoffa's slate is about power and
perks for officers.''
</P>
<P>
   Leedham drove home that message to Teamsters truckers and
forklift operators at James Ferrera &AMP; Sons on Will Drive in Canton,
grabbing the workers' attention as they walked out of the building
into the sweltering heat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hi, I'm Tom Leedham. I started at a grocery warehouse. I'm not
a millionaire lawyer... I'm running for president,'' he said,
handing out leaflets that described him as a ``real Teamster who
knows what it means to have a boss breathing down your neck while
you throw 4,000 pounds of freight in a single shift.''
</P>
<P>
   David Lyle, deputy campaign manager of the Hoffa Now campaign in
Washington, bristled at the suggestion that his candidate has not
done the work of a rank and file Teamster. Lyle said Hoffa drove a
truck at a US Air Force base in Clear, Alaska, and loaded and
unloaded ships elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Hoffa ``has been a dues-paying member for 28 years, and he spent
his career serving the members as a lawyer,'' Lyle said. ``Unlike
Tom Leedham, he did not spend the last five years in the service of
Ron Carey.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoffa ran and lost to incumbent Teamsters president Ron Carey in
1996, but a re-run election was scheduled after the contest was
overturned and Carey was barred from participating because of a
campaign finance scandal. That re-run will be held in September by
mail ballot.
</P>
<P>
   A relative unknown in a campaign in which the biggest stumbling
block to victory is the Hoffa name, Leedham had been on the 1996
Carey slate of officers. Thursday he garnered backing from former
Carey supporters, as well as from a trucker who said he had
considered voting for Hoffa.
</P>
<P>
   Asked how he planned to vote, 54-year-old John Sheehan, a
warehouseman for 29 years, said: ``Not for Hoffa, that's for sure.
He's living on his father's name.''
</P>
<P>
   But others said they knew too little about Leedham to choose
between the two candidates. ``I was for Hoffa, but I need to know
more about (Leedham),'' said Ken Gifford, 30.
</P>
<P>
   Trucker Peter McLean said his vote would go to the candidate
with the best pension and benefits proposal. ``Anybody who can push
up the pension, I'll vote for,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Since May, Leedham has been traveling around the country, hoping
to capture enough votes in the upcoming election to garner
leadership of the 1.4 million-member International Brotherhood of
Teamsters.
</P>
<P>
   The big question, though, is whether he can take on _ and beat _
Hoffa, the son of &UR;  &LR; former Teamsters president James R. Hoffa. The
senior Hoffa became president in 1957, but later served four years
in prison for jury tampering and defrauding the union's pension
fund.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really believe the (Hoffa) name is a two-edged sword,''
Leedham said Thursday. ``I think we'll win because Hoffa is
surrounded by the same people who fought against union reform.''
Leedham, who started in the union at a grocery warehouse 21 years
ago, has served as secretary-treasurer of Local 206 in Portland. In
1996 he was elected an international vice president. He also became
director of the union's warehouse section, which has 400,000
members.

SENATE OKS TAX CUT FOR BAY STATE INSURANCE INDUSTRY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LYNNLEY BROWNING  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ In a sign that Massachusetts insurers may finally get a
long-awaited tax break, the state Senate Thursday approved its tax
relief bill, then vowed to race against time to try to craft a
compromise version with the House before the Legislature adjourns
for summer.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers said they were hopeful of finding middle ground in a
matter of days to resolve a debate over how much insurers should be
required to spend on community investment projects in return for
multimillion-dollar tax breaks.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be a compromise version, and it's very likely it
will be embraced by the House and Senate before July 31,'' said
Senator Warren E. Tolman (D-Watertown), referring to the date by
which lawmakers must reach a deal if a final bill is to be passed
in this session.
</P>
<P>
   Added one source at the House Insurance Committee: ``The ability
to work this out (by July 31) looks very good.''
</P>
<P>
   But some cautioned it was possible insurers might not see a
final bill until fall.
</P>
<P>
   Senators Thursday overwhelmingly passed a measure approving tax
cuts for insurers based in Massachusetts in exchange for $250
million in lower-income community investment over five years. A
House version of the bill, passed in May, grants most of the same
tax breaks but calls for only $150 million in investment. Either
bill would reduce the insurance industry's tax burden by $50
million to $69 million a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The differences (between the two bills) are not enormous,''
said Senator Stanley C. Rosenberg, chairman of the Senate Ways and
Means Committee, which reviews all financial legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Beacon Hill sources said lawmakers might seek to work out
differences between the bills informally rather than convene a
conference committee. Rosenberg said the committee could work on
the issue into the summer and present a final bill for legislators
to vote on in absentia.
</P>
<P>
   Separately, the state Senate Thursday passed a House-approved
bill allowing mutually owned insurers to form holding companies.
The law, which Acting Governor Paul Cellucci has said he will sign,
lets insurers raise capital by issuing stock but does not require
them to share accumulated profits with policyholders, who nominally
own mutual insurers. Nearly two dozen states have passed similar
laws.
</P>
<P>
   Both the Senate and House insurance tax-cut bills would scrap
the 14 percent net investment tax now paid by Massachusetts life
insurers as well as eliminate two smaller but costly taxes paid by
property and casualty insurers headquartered in the state. The
State bill also grants a 1.5 percent tax credit on the amount
invested by any insurer working in Massachusetts in community
projects, and gives community advocates a greater say in how
insurers finance lower-income projects.

STOCKS OFF ON ASIAN ECONOMIC CRISIS FEARS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER G. GOSSELIN   
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Stocks dipped sharply Thursday on worries about
corporate profits and the Asian crisis, extending a three-day
decline that snapped the market's latest record-breaking runup.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 195.93, or 2.2 percent,
to close at 8932.98. Since last Friday's record close, the 30-stock
Dow has lost 4.3 percent of its value, but is still up 13 percent
for the year.
</P>
<P>
   Other major market measures also dropped. The Standard &AMP; Poor's
500 Index fell 24.32, or 2.1 percent, to 1139.76, its biggest
decline since early this year. The technology-heavy Nasdaq
Composite Index lost 34.53, or 1.8 percent, to close at 1935.22.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said the sharpness of Thursday's decline suggested how
edgy investors are with stock prices in record high terrain. But
most dismissed the notion that the recent drop signaled the start
of the long-feared bear market.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see it as the beginning of any sort of major
correction,'' said Mickey Levy, chief economist with Nationsbanc
Montgomery Securities in New York.
</P>
<P>
   The most immediate explanation for Thursday's decline was a
series of disappointing profit reports that revived investors'
fears that stock prices have been bid up beyond what companies'
earning power can justify.
</P>
<P>
   Aircraft manufacturer Boeing Co. announced that second-quarter
profits slipped a more-than-expected 46 percent to $258 million
even as revences rose. The news sent the company's shares tumbling
6 1/4 or 13 percent to 41 1/2. Boeing said that it may cut as many
as 8,000 more jobs than it had previously planned. Shares of golf
club maker Callaway Golf Co. lost one third of their value after
the California-base company said its 1998 earnings will fall well
short of forecasts. The stock fell 6 1/4 to close at 12 3/4.
Industrial products maker Minnesota Mining &AMP; Manufacturing Co. said
it will lay off 4,000 workers after second quarter profits fell 7.7
percent to $386 million.
</P>
<P>
   The new round of weak profit reports compounded investor jitters
set off earlier this week when Federal Reserve Chairman Alan
Greenspan coupled a generally upbeat assessment of the US economy
with a warning that the Asian crisis shows no signs of ending and a
reminder that a stock-market drop looms somewhere in the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``History tells us that there will be a correction of some
significant dimension,' the Fed chairman lectured the House Banking
Committee Wednesday. ``What it doesn't help you on very much is
when,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   The latest worries about Asia, profits and the inevitable end of
the stock boom represent the latest zig in investors' zig-zagging
assessment of the economy and the potential for making money in
stocks. In the two weeks preceding this one, stock buyers seemed to
slough off long-held concerns and send many stocks to record highs.
</P>
<P>
   Not all corporate news was bleak Thursday. For example, AT&AMP;T
Corp. announced that quarterly profits jumped 60 percent because of
aggressive cost-cutting. Profits from continuing operations rose to
$1.49 billion, or slightly more than expected. AT&AMP;T shares rose
15/16 to 58 5/.
</P>
<P>
   But stock losers outnumbered gainers three-to-one as drug,
fashion and some - but by no means all -- Internet stocks tumbled.
</P>
<P>
   Drug stocks took the biggest hits. Pfizer Inc, which has almost
doubled in the last year largely on the strength of Viagra sales,
fell 4 3/4 to 111 5/8. Merck &AMP; Co. declined for a third day,
shaving 1 11/16 to close at 123 7/16.
</P>
<P>
   One of the biggest dollar losers of the day was Amazon.com, the
red-hot on-line bookseller whose shares lost 6 3/8 to close at 127
5/8 after reporting that it had lost a less-than-expected, but
still-considerable $21.2 million last quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts said the fact that similar high-tech stocks did
not suffer correspondingly large drops Thursday suggests that the
current downdraft could well carry the market lower.
</P>
<P>
   ``This...still hasn't reached the Internet stocks,'' said Ned
Riley, BankBoston's chief investment officer.

MCCURRY QUITTING AS WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANN SCALES  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Michael D. McCurry, the unflappable press secretary
whose name has become synonymous with the White House, is resigning
his high-profile post, President Clinton announced Thursday,
marking the first senior staff departure since the Monica S.
Lewinsky investigation began.
</P>
<P>
   McCurry, who has enjoyed unparalleled access to Clinton as his
spokesman, will leave in October to pursue a career change. He will
be succeded by his deputy, Joe Lockhart. Although Lockhart lacks
McCurry's deftness in foreign policy, he is a veteran of political
campaigns and in Clinton's words is an ``ideal replacement.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton ended months of speculation about McCurry's plans by
making a surprise visit to the White House briefing room and
saying, ``The long-awaited coup in the press office is finally
taking place.''
</P>
<P>
   That coup was an exception to the routine in Washington: It was
not leaked in advance to reporters. ``It's rare in the White House
that I get to announce my own personnel decisions,'' the president
said.
</P>
<P>
   He credited McCurry with redefining the role of the press
secretary in an era of 24-hour news cycles and cable channels
filling special niches, and said: ``Mike McCurry has set the
standard by which future White House press secretaries will be
judged. ... And few can hope to match his intelligence and wit from
the podium.''
</P>
<P>
   That intelligence and wit have made McCurry arguably the most
respected press secretary in recent times among White House
reporters, and one whose access to Clinton will be hard to match.
He is famous for cajoling as well as bullying correspondents, who
respect him for his integrity and ability to play both sides _
protecting the president and helping them.
</P>
<P>
   He once entered the White House briefing room wearing a large
paper bag over his head and pretending to be an anonymous source.
But there were other times he was dour and testy, especially when
confronted with repeated questions about investigations involving
the president.
</P>
<P>
   Jody Powell, the press secretary for President Jimmy Carter,
said, ``Mike has done a tremendous job for the president, the
administration, and has been just an outstanding press secretary
for a job that is a lot tougher than when I held it too many years
ago.''
</P>
<P>
   But McCurry also has been criticized for admitting in the first
few weeks after the Lewinsky scandal story became public that he
did not want to know about Clinton's relationship with her for fear
of subjecting himself to a subpoena and subsequent legal bills.
</P>
<P>
   In a February interview with The Chicago Tribune, McCurry
suffered what he described as a ``lapse in my sanity'' when he
suggested there may not be a simple explanation of Clinton's
relationship with Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   McCurry has spent 22 years as a press secretary, with the past 3
1/2 years at the White House following two years at the State
Department.
</P>
<P>
   He said Thursday he wants to spend more time with his wife and
three children, and that his decision to leave the White House was
unrelated to Starr's investigation or other scandals. ``I can
assure you it had nothing to do with anything else.''
</P>
<P>
   McCurry made it known last year that he was ready to leave his
$125,000-a-year post, as did several other senior aides who are key
members of Clinton's inner circle. The Lewinsky scandal pushed back
that decision for him.
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart, McCurry's successor, has worked for ABC and CNN,
leaving television in 1988 to work on the presidential campaign of
former Massachusetts Governor Michael Dukakis. Lockhart earlier
worked on the presidential campaigns of Carter and Walter Mondale.
In 1996, he handled the press for the reelection campaign for
Clinton and Vice President Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart said he was ``daunted and kind of intimidated'' to
follow McCurry's footsteps. ``It's like the poor fool who's going
to have to step in for Michael Jordan next year.''
</P>
<P>
   McCurry said he has some ideas for consultant work, looks
forward to accepting invitations to speak, and eventually will
probably like to teach, though ``I don't have a clue what I would
actually want to teach.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if Harvard University's Kennedy School of Government was
on his list, considering his previous appearances there, McCurry
quipped: ``If I end up going to Harvard, I'll leak it to The Boston
Globe first.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In a sign of growing confidence at the White House
that it is weathering the Monica Lewinsky investigation, Mike
McCurry, who has used an agile wit and aggressive tactics to
promote the administration and defend it from scandal, will resign
as press secretary this fall, President Clinton announced Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The president referred Thursday to McCurry's skill at gliding
just beyond a question's reach. ``His ability to respond to
developments precisely _ and, when necessary, not so precisely _
have made him a unique and instrumental element of our nation's
public diplomacy around the world,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   With that sort of sleight-of-mouth, along with a lopsided grin
and a sharp appreciation for the needs of news organizations,
McCurry has managed to maintain cordial, respectful relations with
the press, even while insisting that he was ``out of the loop'' and
unable to answer questions about Ms. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   He will be replaced by Joseph Lockhart, who served as Clinton's
1996 campaign spokesman before becoming one of McCurry's deputies
last year.
</P>
<P>
   The transition, which will take place when Congress leaves in
October, is part of a broader White House changeover that has been
frozen since January, when Clinton was accused of having an affair
with Ms. Lewinsky and covering it up.
</P>
<P>
   McCurry and several other high-ranking Clinton advisers had
hoped to leave after the president's first term to take more
lucrative and less consuming jobs in the private sector. But they
delayed their departures for fear of creating an image of a White
House in panicked retreat.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``For a lot of us, there was a period of time in the beginning
and the first half of the year that it felt like it wasn't the
right time to be leaving,'' one senior administration official
said, on condition of anonymity. ``But now we've sort of settled in
here.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to McCurry, Rahm Emanuel, a senior adviser to
Clinton, is planning to leave this fall. Two aides said that they
expect that chief of staff Erskine Bowles will also leave by the
November elections. And Doug Sosnik, a close adviser to Clinton, is
also considering departing _ though he has been doing so for so
long that he has joked he left and came back.
</P>
<P>
   It is a measure of how much turbulence has shaken the White
House this year that the departure of some of the president's most
trusted lieutenants would seem a sign of growing stability.
</P>
<P>
   More than any other White House aide, McCurry has been the
public voice and face of the Clinton administration. Clinton called
him ``the standard by which future White House press secretaries
will be judged.''
</P>
<P>
   McCurry, 43, left his post as State Department spokesman after
the Republican landslide in 1994 to try to repair Clinton's
battered press relations.
</P>
<P>
   It has been an uphill struggle. In addition to confronting a
daily barrage of foreign and domestic issues, McCurry found himself
facing a blur of controversies, including the Whitewater land deal,
the 1996 campaign finance irregularities, the Paula Jones sexual
misconduct suit, the Lewinsky investigation, and the president's
decisions to permit the Chinese to launch U.S. satellites.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the press was changing, demanding constant
White House comment as the Internet and 24-hour-news networks
obliterated the traditional daily news cycle.
</P>
<P>
   McCurry sometimes turned the relentless demands of news
organizations to his advantage. After the Lewinsky charges broke,
the networks began cutting into regular programming to show
McCurry's briefing.
</P>
<P>
   He responded by trotting officials to the lectern before him to
describe the president's policy proposals. Essentially, he
force-fed policy to viewers expecting scandal. ``Note to stations
down the line,'' McCurry said with a broad grin, after a rather
mind-numbing description of a $10 billion school modernization bond
initiative. ``We're now returning you to your regularly scheduled
program.''
</P>
<P>
   McCurry, who has worked dawn to dark at the White House, said
Thursday that he planned to spend more time with his wife and three
children, to consult, to lecture and to teach. He said that he had
no plans to write a book.
</P>
<P>
   He said that he notified Clinton of his plan to leave in a
letter on May 29. Thanking the president for his chance to service,
McCurry wrote, ``I'm proud to be a part of the history you are
making.''
</P>
<P>
   McCurry has been accused at times of misleading reporters, on
matters as diverse as whether the president's lawyers had hired
private investigators to the nature of meetings Clinton held with
Indonesian billionaire James Riady. In some cases, McCurry based
his answers on flawed information provided by other aides.
</P>
<P>
   McCurry has sometimes been caught between an angry president and
an angry press corps, and has served as a punching bag for both,
aides have said. Internally, McCurry is known for pushing to
release information quickly, believing that the appearance of a
stonewall would do more damage in the long term. But after losing
some of those battles, he has had to face the public as the
embodiment of a White House refusal to answer questions.
</P>
<P>
   Asked Thursday for the key to survival and success in his job,
McCurry said, ``Just keep your eye on what matters most, remember
that your first and foremost obligation is to the truth and the
American people, and to get everyone to get to that point sooner or
later. And if you can keep the crowd entertained on the way, that's
all the better.''

MEEHAN SETS HEARINGS ON FBI-MOB LINK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MITCHELL ZUCKOFF  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Troubled by recent revelations in the two-decade
relationship between the FBI and gangster James J. ``Whitey''
Bulger, US Rep. Martin T. Meehan announced plans Thursday to hold
congressional hearings on federal agencies' use of criminal
informants.
</P>
<P>
   Meehan said the FBI's kid-glove treatment in the 1970s and 1980s
of Bulger and his ally, Stephen Flemmi, raised serious concerns
about ``establishing, maintaining and monitoring relationships
between agents and informants.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a line which cannot be crossed,'' said Meehan, a
Massachusetts Democrat in an interview Thursday. ``There is no
excuse for informants getting a license to continue selling drugs
to kids or committing violent crimes. There should be no carte
blanche.''
</P>
<P>
   Meehan, a former state prosecutor who serves on the crime
subcommittee of the House Judiciary Committee, said the panel's
Republican chairman, Bill McCollom of Florida, has given him a
commitment to hold the hearing. However, it will be delayed until
the completion of US District Court hearings in Boston on whether
the 1995 indictments of Bulger, Flemmi and other reputed mobsters
should be dismissed as a result of FBI misconduct. Those court
hearings are scheduled to resume next month.
</P>
<P>
   Meehan said it was too early to say who would be called to
testify, but FBI Director Louis Freeh would likely be the lead
witness in the examination of informant policies and practices.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Massachusetts US Attorney Donald K. Stern and &UR;  &LR; Barry
W. Mawn, Boston's top FBI agent, acknowledged in separate
statements Thursday that the bureau's dealings with Bulger and
Flemmi fell below proper standards for controlling the criminal
behavior of informants.
</P>
<P>
   Both, however, said their offices have taken extensive steps to
prevent such breakdowns in the future and will prosecute any agents
who fail to comply.
</P>
<P>
   ``The FBI and attorney general informant guidelines, together
with FBI administrative controls, are intended to provide the
necessary checks and balances and to ensure that often difficult
decisions are made at the appropriate level, based on complete and
accurate information,'' Stern said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   ``While admittedly no system is foolproof, clearly those
objectives were not met here, at least in certain critical
respects,'' the statement said.
</P>
<P>
   Stern issued the carefully-worded remarks on the heels of a
five-part Globe Spotlight Team series about Bulger and the FBI. The
statement represented his clearest public acknowledgement that
appropriate boundaries between informants and agents were crossed.
</P>
<P>
   Stern said there are ``important lessons'' to be learned from
the federal court hearings before Judge Mark L. Wolf. But he
declined to elaborate, saying he was limited by the ongoing federal
court hearings. Stern's subordinates are trying to preserve the
government's case against Bulger, Flemmi, reputed New England Mafia
boss Francis Salemme and other reputed mobsters named in a sweeping
federal racketeering case.
</P>
<P>
   ``Decisions that get made in this area in a case-by-case basis
can be very difficult,'' Stern added. ``It's important that we have
an accountable and carefully supervised program ... We need to
revisit the national guidelines and make sure they are the right
ones and are serving the right purposes.''
</P>
<P>
   Stern said such a review is already under way on a national
basis at the Justice Deparment and the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  He and Mawn, special agent in charge of the Boston FBI
office, both noted that Connecticut Deputy US Attorney John Durham
is directing a team of prosecutors and agents investigating
allegations of misconduct by individual FBI agents. At the request
of both Stern and Mawn, Durham has been named a special assistant
US attorney in Massachusetts to conduct the probe.
</P>
<P>
   Mawn also expressed his faith in existing guidelines. Still, he
said, ``These controls are obviously weakened and nullified if the
FBI supervisor is corrupted and does not ensure complete compliance
on the part of the handling agent.''
</P>
<P>
   Mawn was referring to disgraced former FBI supervisor John
Morris, who admitted during testimony in April that he accepted
$7,000 in bribes from Bulger and Flemmi, and former FBI agent John
Connolly, the two gangsters' primary handler.
</P>
<P>
   Using testimony from the federal court hearings, formerly secret
documents and extensive interviews, the Globe series detailed how,
beginning in 1975 and continuing for nearly two decades, Connolly
nurtured a relationship with Bulger.
</P>
<P>
   The stories showed how that relationship ultimately led to
embellishments of Bulger's value as a Mafia informant, as well as
providing him with a longstanding shield against prosecution by
other law enforcement agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Connolly has denied any wrongdoing. He insists Bulger's value in
helping the FBI destroy the Angiulo organized crime family more
than justified the relationship.
</P>
<P>
   Until the national review of informant policies is completed,
Mawn said, he will take steps on a local level to ensure proper
handling of informants.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm obviously sensitized to these things so there will be even
more supervisory review at a higher level, particularly as it
pertains to authorized criminal activity,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A key question before Judge Wolf is whether FBI agents gave
Bulger and Flemmi permission to commit crimes, effectively
immunizing them from the kind of prosecution they now face.
</P>
<P>
   In calling for hearings, Representative Meehan said the Bulger
case and others around the country make it necessary for Congress
to exercise its oversight role.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to McCollom, the committee chairman, Meehan wrote:
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; ``While it is surely difficult to establish `bright-line'
rules for dealing with informants, federal law enforcement agents
clearly should not be giving informants a virtual blank cheque ...
ignoring evidence of continuing criminality on the part of
informants, exaggerating the value of information provided by
informants, and accepting cash payments from informants.''
</P>
<P>
   In the interview Thursday, Meehan said that prosecution of
organized crime ``is impossible without infiltrating criminal
entities. I'm sensitive to that. But this case and others raise
issues that clearly from a public policy perspective need to be
discussed before the Judiciary Committee's crime subcommittee.''
</P>
<P>
   Justice Department spokesman Bert Brandenberg said the agency
would continue its ``long history of working with Congress. If they
have a hearing on this, we'll work with them on it.''

INCOMING WHITE HOUSE PRESS CHIEF HEEDS HARD POLITICAL LESSON 
</HEADLINE>
  (sidear with CLINTON-MCCURRY) 
(bl) 
 By DAVID STOUT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As he recalls it a decade later, the summer of 1988
taught Joseph Lockhart a lesson he would never forget.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton's newly chosen press secretary was then the
deputy press secretary for Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis, the
Democratic nominee for president. Polls showed Dukakis with a
double-digit lead over the presumptive Republican nominee, Vice
President George Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Then came August.
</P>
<P>
   Bush came to life, attacking the Democrats again and again.
Dukakis remained almost eerily silent, telling those closest to him
that Americans would not get interested in the campaign until Labor
Day. His lead vanished.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was defining for a lot of people in the campaign,''
Lockhart said Thursday. The lesson: ``News goes on 24 hours a day.
The assertion without a response quickly becomes conventional
wisdom and then a fact.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a lesson he remembered in 1996, when he was national
press secretary for President Clinton's re-election campaign and
excelled in terse, sometimes snide ripostes.
</P>
<P>
   When Clinton's Republican opponent, former Senate Majority
Leader Bob Dole, suggested in a speech that Clinton was naive in
his dealings with the former Soviet Union, Clinton's aides
countered that Dole had an outdated view of the world, one that
failed to take account of Russia's declining influence. Or, as
Lockhart said of Dole's address, ``Right speech, wrong decade.''
</P>
<P>
   People familiar with the stocky, prematurely gray Lockhart, 39,
describe him as intense, even driven, yet patient and affable. But
he clearly relishes the rough-and-tumble of politics, and those who
know him expect him to take a more bare-knuckled approach to his
job than his predecessor, Mike McCurry.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Patrick Lockhart was born July 13, 1959, in the Bronx,
New York City, and grew up in Suffern, N.Y. His father, Ray, a
former vice president at NBC, and his mother, Ann, are deceased.
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart graduated from Georgetown University, where he majored
in European history. He was a regional press coordinator for
President Jimmy Carter's 1980 re-election campaign and an assistant
press secretary for Walter Mondale's 1984 presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart and his wife, Laura Logan, a former ABC producer, live
in Northwest Washington and have a daughter, Clare, 4.
</P>
<P>
   Before joining the White House in 1997 as the deputy press
secretary, Lockhart worked in public relations, as a senior vice
president for Robinson Lerer Sawyer Miller in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1990s, he worked for Rupert Murdoch's Sky
Television News in London ( Lockhart said he was hired just because
Murdoch wanted an American face on camera), where he reported on
economics. He has also worked for the Cable News Network and for
ABC. Lockhart was the producer for NBC News' Emmy Award-winning
coverage of the revolution in Romania.
</P>
<P>
   As for how he landed his latest job, Lockhart said Thursday: ``I
often find that six months of begging is counterproductive. This
time it worked.''

<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Wired, wrinkled and wily, Al ``Grandpa Munster''
Lewis took his campaign for governor to the state capital Thursday,
upstaging his running mate's criminal justice platform with a
typically theatrical _ and occasionally substantive _ performance.
</P>
<P>
   The onetime co-star of the 1960s television series, ``The
Munsters,'' Lewis, 88, amused a small crowd with persistent
references to Gov. George Pataki as ``George Potato Head Pataki''
and insinuations that reporters are ineducable.
</P>
<P>
   But he seemed to stumble a bit when pressed on exactly what he
would do to help the poor and middle class, except feed New York
legislators to sharks.
</P>
<P>
   After considerable prodding, Lewis said he would heavily tax
Wall Street moguls to raise money for the underclass, reform
campaign finance laws and socialize medicine. But his ``I am my
brother's keeper'' message was almost lost in a rapid-fire flurry
of quips and cracks and savvy sound bites.
</P>
<P>
   ``They say, `How can you talk about the governor that way?'''
Lewis said, his face contorted around an unlit all-day cigar.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I beg your pardon,'' the Green Party candidate said
sarcastically. ``I didn't know he was the Duke of Windsor. I didn't
know he was Lord Montbatten ... The year before he was nominated
... if you and I went to the 10 largest cities in the state of New
York and interviewed 600,000 people, we wouldn't find one person
who ever heard of George Potato Head Pataki! It's a fact. He was
extracted from a junkyard by the number one junk keeper, Alfonse _
he doesn't like that name, he lists himself as `Al' _ Pothole
D'Amato.''

   While Lewis stole the show and played to the cameras at a press
conference, his running mate, Alice Green of Albany, and senatorial
candidate Joel Kovel strived to generate some interest in their
plan to overhaul New York's criminal justice system, repeal the
harsh Rockefeller drug laws and shift the focus of officialdom from
street crimes to white-collar offenses.

``violent'' first time offenders _ a ``purely emotional reaction''

<P>
   Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver, D-Manhattan, has opposed the
measure and refused to allow a vote before the Legislature
adjourned last month. However, after weeks of pounding by
Republicans, Silver announced that he will call the Assembly back
to pass Jenna's Law.
</P>
<P>
   One letter issued by state Republicans included nine photographs
of violent criminals, with the caption: ``These violent rapists,
killers and child molesters will soon be out on the street again
... all because of one man: Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver.''
</P>
<P>
   Green and Kovel said the poster was overtly racist.
</P>
<P>
   ``It almost has a lynch-mob quality about it,'' Green said.
``The suggestion is that only blacks or Latinos commit these
horrendous crimes.''
</P>
<P>
   Terry O'Brien, spokesman for the state GOP, noted that six of
the nine defendants whose mug shots were included with the letter
are Caucasian. He said Green's charges are offensive, and compared
her political tactics to those of Alton Maddox Jr. and C. Vernon
Mason, advisers to Tawana Brawley.
</P>
<P>
   A jury recently found that Maddox and Mason, black activists,
along with the Rev. Al Sharpton, had exploited a black teen-ager's
fake rape claims to smear the reputation of a white prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
   The Green Party is hoping that Lewis' celebrity will attract at
least 50,000 votes, which would give the group a line on the ballot
for the next four years. Without official sanction from the state,
the Greens cannot run candidates without going through the costly
and cumbersome process of mounting a petition drive.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis said his candidacy will draw to the polls people who
usually don't bother to vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``I appeal to the largest bloc of voters in the state of New
York and none of you know what it is, so I will tell you!'' Lewis
bellowed. ``It's the embarrassing number of 60 percent who don't
vote.''

MARK HAMPTON, 58, CELEBRATED INTERIOR DECORATOR 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By MITCHELL OWENS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Mark Hampton, the interior decorator whose relaxed
traditionalism was embraced by America's stylish elite, making him
a celebrated symbol of gracious living for decades, died Thursday
at NYU Medical Center. He was 58.
</P>
<P>
   He died of cardiac arrest brought on by liver cancer, his wife,
Duane, said.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, Hampton was most closely associated with
President and Mrs. Bush, for whom he consulted on the decor of a
half-dozen homes, including the White House; the vice president's
residence; Blair House, the official residence for guests of the
president; the presidential retreat at Camp David, Md.; the Bush
family's seaside retreat in Kennebunkport, Maine, and the couple's
retirement home in Houston. He also decorated the George Bush
Presidential Library and Museum in College Station, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   More a distiller than an innovator, Hampton built his career on
giving the public exactly the style it wanted at precisely the time
it realized it wanted it. In the 1960s and 1970s that meant
discotheque modernism in primary colors inspired by the work of his
mentor, David Hicks, the flamboyant British decorator who died
March 29. But it was crisp but comfortable traditionalism that
became Hampton's hallmark in the early 1980s and that made him an
icon of American style and one of the nation's most sought-after
decorators.
</P>
<P>
   His use of such upper-crust accoutrements as 18th and early
19th-century American and English antiques, flowery chintz and
smartly tailored upholstery added up to a seductive atmosphere of
low-key privilege that attracted such eminent clients as dance
patron Anne Bass; philanthropist Brooke Astor; Estee Lauder (for
whom he decorated three houses, one in France); television
journalist Mike Wallace; Carter Brown, former director of the
National Gallery; socialite Susan Burden and her late husband,
Carter, the rare book collector, and Lincoln Kirsten.
</P>
<P>
   Like Sister Parish, the late doyenne of American interior
design, and Mario Buatta, known as the prince of chintz, who worked
with Hampton on Blair House, Mark Hampton was one of the few
American decorators to become a household name. Part of his renown
was due to his timing; he came to prominence in the 1980s, a decade
in which fortunes were being made, interior design magazines were
almost as avidly followed as the stock market and the English
country style that Hampton so successfully mined and refined was at
its peak of popularity.
</P>
<P>
   But that was only one aspect of Hampton's career, whose
stylistic influences were much broader than his popular image would
indicate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have absolutely no interest in a trademark style,'' he once
said. ``Some would say, `He has no style, no look.' Well, I don't
get it. That isn't what I set out to do. I just set out to be a
decorator, to do a good job and have fun. I've wondered with envy
at people who like one thing and work at it and it becomes their
realm. Those people who can say, `I love Winterthur but I hate
Lyndhurst,' people who have these enormous, refined senses of hate.
I love Winterthur, Lyndhurst, Greek Revival and French houses. Of
course, I daydream constantly about English houses, and those
shingle-style American houses built in 1905 full of furniture from
jillions of other periods.''
</P>
<P>
   Hampton's fame was aided too by his success in the retail and
publishing worlds. In 1988, the decorator began an association with
Hickory Chair, a leading furniture manufacturer in North Carolina,
creating furnishings for the well-heeled consumer. Eventually, the
Mark Hampton Collection grew to more than 250 pieces, some of them
inspired by antiques found in the decorator's own apartment on Park
Avenue and his weekend house, a remodeled gardener's cottage in the
Long Island resort town of Southhampton. He also designed fabrics
for Kravet and upholstery trimmings for Scalamandre.
</P>
<P>
   A year after he signed a contract with Hickory Chair, Random
House published ''Mark Hampton on Decorating,'' a collection of
refreshingly opinionated, sensible-minded essays that were
originally published in House &AMP; Garden, and later, in House
Beautiful.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was that rare thing _ an articulate decorator,'' said Louis
Oliver Gropp of House Beautiful, who led House &AMP; Garden when
Hampton's columns were a popular feature of the magazine. ``He was
a memorable speaker, a thoughtful speaker, and his writing had
content as well as verve.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Mark Hampton on Decorating'' and a companion volume of essays
that followed, `Legendary Decorators of the Twentieth Century'
(Doubleday), gave him a cult following, a rarity in the world of
decor. The books were admired as much for their easy,
conversational tone and generous, impeccable advice as for their
illustrations: polychrome and grisaille watercolors from Hampton's
own hand.
</P>
<P>
   Magazine editors and friends had long looked forward to
receiving personal notes from Hampton, whose neat calligraphy was
often accompanied by comical drawings depicting, say, Madonna's
cone-shaped bustier or the Buster Brown-bob wig of Madeleine
Castaing, a Parisian decorator who was one of Hampton's idols.
</P>
<P>
   But the public knew nothing of his artistic skills until 1980,
when a one-man show of his artwork was held at Acquavella Galleries
in Manhattan. A 40th-birthday gift from his wife, Duane, the show
featured more than 400 items assembled from private collections,
including a pair of corduroy pants that had been hand-decorated for
a college classmate and a hand-painted Easter egg made for the
celebrity realtor Edward Lee Cave.
</P>
<P>
   After years of celebrity, Hampton's in-store promotional
appearances began to attract many admirers, who would ask to be
photographed with him as a souvenir. Stores came to expect crowds
smaller, though as enthusiastic, as those that awaited the
appearances of rock stars.
</P>
<P>
   In his appearances and lectures and in print, he imbued the
study of design with a novelist's appreciation of a good story and
an actor's skill in wryly telling it. He could keep his listeners
enthralled with tales of Rose Cumming, an eccentric 1940s grande
dame decorator, who began her career as a kept woman, all the while
wondering aloud how Miss Cumming's romantic life might explain the
louche, unconventional glamour of her interiors.

`MUNSTERS' CO-STAR VEXES INCUMBENT IN N.Y. CAMPAIGN 
</HEADLINE>
   (EDs: SUBS hed; filed in ``a'' and ``p'' categories)

<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Wired, wrinkled and wily, Al ``Grandpa Munster''
Lewis took his campaign for governor to the state capital Thursday,
upstaging his running mate's criminal justice platform with a
typically theatrical _ and occasionally substantive _ performance.
</P>
<P>
   The onetime co-star of the 1960s television series, ``The
Munsters,'' Lewis, 88, amused a small crowd with persistent
references to Gov. George Pataki as ``George Potato Head Pataki''
and insinuations that reporters are ineducable.
</P>
<P>
   But he seemed to stumble a bit when pressed on exactly what he
would do to help the poor and middle class, except feed New York
legislators to sharks.
</P>
<P>
   After considerable prodding, Lewis said he would heavily tax
Wall Street moguls to raise money for the underclass, reform
campaign finance laws and socialize medicine. But his ``I am my
brother's keeper'' message was almost lost in a rapid-fire flurry
of quips and cracks and savvy sound bites.
</P>
<P>
   ``They say, `How can you talk about the governor that way?'''
Lewis said, his face contorted around an unlit all-day cigar.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I beg your pardon,'' the Green Party candidate said
sarcastically. ``I didn't know he was the Duke of Windsor. I didn't
know he was Lord Montbatten ... The year before he was nominated
... if you and I went to the 10 largest cities in the state of New
York and interviewed 600,000 people, we wouldn't find one person
who ever heard of George Potato Head Pataki! It's a fact. He was
extracted from a junkyard by the number one junk keeper, Alfonse _
he doesn't like that name, he lists himself as `Al' _ Pothole
D'Amato.''
</P>
<P>
   Pataki is a Republican and D'Amato is the Republican senator.
Both men are running for re-election this year.

 NEW YORK: her interiors. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``His knowledge of the decorative arts was really
unparalleled,'' said Paige Rense, editor in chief of Architectural
Digest. ``He loved teaching. I never knew of a client that didn't
learn from him. A writer or editor, either.''
</P>
<P>
   Mark Iredell Hampton Jr. was born in 1940 in Plainfield, Ind., a
small town near Indianapolis that has been home to the Hamptons for
seven generations. The only son of Mark Hampton, a mortician, and
the former Alice Burkert, he had an Andy Hardy-style childhood,
passed in a white clapboard Colonial-style house with inky green
shutters.
</P>
<P>
   He spent his teen-age years driving a tractor and baling hay on
the family's 380-acre farm. The first hint that Hampton would not
grow old tilling the soil in rural Indiana was his first
do-it-yourself decorating project at age 12: a set of shutters for
his bedroom, which he refinished in his parents basement and then
installed on his own. ``From that moment on, I considered myself a
decorator,'' wrote Hampton, who went on to confound his parents by
amassing a collection of back issues of House &AMP; Garden. The
parents, however, had other career ideas for their only son.
</P>
<P>
   Hampton graduated from DePauw University and dutifully later
attended the University of Michigan Law School. But his love of
design wasn't to be forgotten. On the first day of school, he
startled his law school roommate by unpacking an unlawyerly cache
of objects from a foot locker: an obelisk, small antique boxes and
a branch of rhododendron. So it was no surprise when Hampton
abandoned law school in 1964 to pursue a degree in art history at
Michigan's School of Fine Arts. He later earned a master's degree
at New York University's Institute of Fine Arts.
</P>
<P>
   In 1967, Hampton, newly incorporated as a decorator, became the
New York representative of David Hicks, the British designer whom
he had met six years earlier, during a junior year abroad at the
London School of Economics.
</P>
<P>
   Hicks was in his heyday , and Hampton was an eager acolyte. For
the next decade, he turned out largely Hicksian interiors that had
more to do with Studio 54 swagger than the country-club comforts
for which he later became celebrated: Op-Art paintings, attentuated
metal tables by Baron Albrizzi, sumptuous white goatskin carpets,
chrome-plated Italian lamps.
</P>
<P>
   Hampton's one-bedroom apartment on East 63rd Street, where he
and his wife lived after their marriage in 1964, attracted the
attention of House &AMP; Garden in 1968. Credited to Hampton and Hicks,
the low-ceilinged living-room featured reflective Mylar wallpaper
with a herringbone motif, a Hicks-design wall-to-wall carpet of
tiny interlocking black-and-white hexagons and a pair of Louis
XV-style chairs from the Door Store.
</P>
<P>
   After breaking with the famously temperamental Hicks, Hampton
spent eight years with the New York society decorators McMillen,
Inc. He left the company to start his own business in 1975.
</P>
<P>
   In time he became one of America's leading decorators and among
the few to call for important redesigns. He was part of the team in
1984 that restored a wing of Gracie Mansion, the residence of the
mayor of New York. He also worked on the governor's mansion in
Albany, N.Y., and decorated the American Academy in Rome.
</P>
<P>
   Though Hampton was an ardent preservationist and lover of
history _ social, decorative and otherwise _ his clients
occasionally did not share his sentiments. The only project that
the decorator ever regretted accepting, he once told a reporter,
was the renovation of the Treaty Room of the White House. Decorated
in a spirited High Victorian style during the Kennedy
administration by French decorator Stephane Boudin, it was redone
at the request of President Bush, who was no fan of Victoriana,
into a blandly traditional private office.
</P>
<P>
   Hampton later expressed disappointment in the previous decor's
loss to the history of the decorative arts. The room's 19th-century
theme was revived in a much awaited and then highly criticized
redecoration by the Arkansas designer Kaki Hockersmith.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his wife of 23 years, the former Duane Flegel,
and his sister, Rachel Hampton Blank of Winnetka, Ill., Hampton is
survived by two daughters, Alexa and Kate, both of New York.
</P>
<P>
   To Hampton, decorating was not just a job, but an adventure. The
pursuit of the beautiful for him rendered life endlessly promising.
``Whether you are in Birmingham, England, or Birmingham, Ala., you
cannot have a bad time because the food is awful or it's raining or
you don't like the hotel,'' he once told Marilyn Bethany in The New
York Times. ``There is always something to see.''

FOX INCREASES ITS ANIMATION DRAW BY 3 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN LEVESQUE  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ With ``The Simpsons'' and ``King of the
Hill,'' Fox has proven there's an appetite out there for chewy,
well-done animated fare in prime time. But on the assumption that
our appetites are insatiable, the network early next year will lay
out a veritable animation smorgasbord, adding three more series,
including a new sci-fi entry from ``Simpsons'' creator Matt
Groening.
</P>
<P>
   If all five animated series are on the schedule at the same
time, they will comprise 25 percent of Fox's prime-time
programming.
</P>
<P>
   Groening's new effort is ``Futurama.'' He said the action takes
place a thousand years from now and features three main characters,
all with the familiar big eyeballs and overbites that Groening
ascribes to ``the tragedy of limited drawing skills.'' The main
character right now is a ``lovably corrupt'' robot named Bender,
possibly the first robot in science fiction that shoplifts.
</P>
<P>
   Joining ``Futurama'' on Fox's tentative midseason schedule are
``The PJs'' and ``Family Guy.'' ``The PJs'' is an Eddie Murphy
project about life in the projects _ the PJs _ with ``foamation''
by Portland's clay-animation pioneer, Will Vinton. The funniest of
the bunch may be ``Family Guy'' from Seth MacFarlane, a 24-year-old
animator with an odd view of the ``typical'' suburban family.
</P>
<P>
   The obvious appeal of ``The Simpsons'' and ``King of the Hill''
has other networks paying attention. This summer, The WB tested
``Invasion America,'' an animated drama from Steven Spielberg's
company, and NBC is working on an Americanized version of a British
animated comedy, ``Stressed Eric.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``Ally McBeal'' cast grows this fall with the addition of
Portia de Rossi, who plays attorney Nell Porter. De Rossi describes
Porter as ``a very strong character, a good lawyer who is
intelligent and makes her own way.''
</P>
<P>
   De Rossi, who studied law in Australia before pursuing an acting
career, said Richard Fish (Greg Germann) hires Porter as a
rainmaker, someone who can attract well-heeled clients to the firm.
As to how Porter interacts with Ally (Calista Flockhart), de Rossi
said, ``We'll just have to wait and see.''
</P>
<P>
   (BBOX)Scott Bairstow, who lives in Mukilteo when not working in
L.A., will join Fox's ``Party of Five'' this season as the
boyfriend of Julia Salinger's (Neve Campbell) college roommate.
Bairstow starred last season in the short-lived ``Significant
Others,'' which was produced by the same people who do ``Party of
Five.''
</P>
<P>
   Josie Bissett, another native of the Seattle area, rejoins
``Melrose Place'' this season after a self-imposed time away.
Though she visited the set occasionally to be with hubby Rob Estes,
she says she didn't watch ``Melrose'' on TV too often.
</P>
<P>
   ``I only watched it when Rob and Heather (Locklear) had love
scenes,'' she laughed. ``It turns me on. What can I say?''

FORMER CLINTON BODYGUARD, ADVISER TESTIFY BEFORE GRAND JURIES 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOHN C. HENRY 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton's former chief bodyguard and one
of his top political advisers testified Thursday before federal
grand juries investigating an alleged presidential affair and
cover-up.
</P>
<P>
   An hour after he went behind closed doors with grand jurors
investigating the president's relationship with Monica Lewinsky,
Secret Service agent Larry Cockell emerged and left the building.
His attorney said Cockell had been told he would not be called
back.
</P>
<P>
   Cockell answered all questions and did not invoke any legal
privilege to keep confidential anything he saw or heard while
guarding the president, said his attorney, John Kotelly.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's glad it's over with,'' Kotelly said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, former White House deputy chief of staff Harold
Ickes, who is part of a group advising Clinton on how to deal with
the Lewinsky matter, made a brief appearance before grand jurors.
He was told he would have to return another day.
</P>
<P>
   As he left the U.S. District Courthouse, Ickes said the purpose
of his testimony was still a mystery. ``My sense is, what they'll
want to know is what I heard and saw while at the White House, but
I don't know,'' he told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Ickes earlier testified before a federal grand jury in
Alexandria, Va., as part of an inquiry into the unauthorized
release of information from the personnel file of Linda Tripp, a
Pentagon employee who prompted the Clinton-Lewinsky segment of
independent counsel Kenneth Starr's investigation of the Clinton
White House.
</P>
<P>
   Tripp secretly tape recorded 20 hours of telephone conversations
with Lewinsky, chats in which the former White House intern
allegedly said that she and Clinton had an 18-month sexual affair
and that he urged her to lie about their relationship. Clinton and
Lewinsky have denied under oath engaging in sex. Clinton has said
publicly he never urged anyone to lie.
</P>
<P>
   Before Cockell testified Thursday afternoon, at least three
other Secret Service employees and a retired agent, Robert
Ferguson, appeared before one of the two grand juries Starr was
using in his investigation into whether Clinton or any of his
associates engaged in perjury, witness intimidation or obstruction
of justice.
</P>
<P>
   The testimony from Cockell, Ferguson and other Secret Service
employees was ordered a week ago after Supreme Court Chief Justice
William Rehnquist refused to intervene in lower court rulings
compelling them to cooperate with Starr's inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   Last Friday, Starr enlisted a grand jury that had not been
hearing evidence in the Lewinsky matter. He scheduled the regular
Lewinsky grand jury to meet an extra day this week, and Thursday he
borrowed another panel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, the independent counsel's office is attempting to
expedite this investigation and this is one means of doing it,''
said Kotelly.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyer said Cockell now wants his job back as chief of the
president's personal security detail, a post he voluntarily gave up
last week out of concern that he would be distracted by his
impending grand jury appearance. Kotelly said Cockell does not
resent having to testify, but he wants to return to his duties and
a relatively normal life.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, having his picture in newspapers and on
television each day has turned Cockell into a public figure,
Kotelly said. ``He will not be able to have the same type of
anonymity he had before and obviously he regrets losing that
because in some ways that affects his ability to do his job in
protecting the president.''
</P>
<P>
   Also, pressure intensified Thursday for Attorney General Janet
Reno to seek another independent counsel to investigate the
president, this time over fund-raising practices of his 1996
re-election effort.
</P>
<P>
   Reno confirmed that she is reviewing a new report and
recommendation from Charles G. LaBella, head of her department's
campaign fund-raising task force, to authorize an independent
inquiry into whether Clinton, Vice President Al Gore or
high-ranking Democratic Party officials violated campaign finance
laws.
</P>
<P>
   At her weekly press briefing, Reno declined to discuss the
contents of LaBella's report, but said she would give the matter a
fair review before determining whether to invoke the law covering
appointment of an independent counsel.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I determine that it is triggered, I will trigger it,''
said the attorney general, who has resisted asking a three-judge
panel to launch an independent inquiry into campaign fund raising
even after one has been repeatedly urged by congressional
Republicans and, late last year, by FBI Director Louis Freeh.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Orrin G. Hatch, R-Utah, chairman of the Judiciary
Committee, renewed his call for Reno to seek an independent inquiry
into fund raising by the Clinton White House. ``If she doesn't do
it this time, I think there had to be some kind of backroom deal
made,'' Hatch said.
</P>
<P>
   Almost a year ago, Reno appointed LaBella, a federal prosecutor,
to head the Justice Department's campaign finance inquiry, which
had been criticized by Republicans as mismanaged. Since then, 11
lower-level fund-raisers have been indicted, but nothing so far has
linked fund-raising improprieties to the White House or Democratic
National Committee.
</P>
<P>
   LaBella delivered his report to Reno a week ago as he left
Washington to return to San Diego, where he will become interim
U.S. attorney.

<P>
   ANDREWS, N.C. _ There is a part of this town that is rooting for
Eric Robert Rudolph to elude the camouflaged G-men and their
droopy-eared bloodhounds, and not just because the six-month search
for the man accused of bombing an Alabama abortion clinic has been
good for business.
</P>
<P>
   As search teams of rifle-toting agents fan through the dense
rhododendron of the Nantahala National Forest, there is a degree of
local pride in the ability of a ninth-grade dropout to outwit more
than 200 investigators equipped with motion detectors and
helicopters with heat sensors.
</P>
<P>
   Factor in an underlayer of anti-abortion sentiment and the
innate distrust of government that is native to the mountains of
western North Carolina and it begins to explain why a local man has
sold more than 200 T-shirts bearing the chant: ``Run Rudolph Run.''
</P>
<P>
   Rudolph has been charged in the Birmingham, Ala., attack, which
killed an off-duty police officer and seriously wounded a nurse.
The authorities want to question him about three other bombings in
Atlanta in 1996 and 1997, including the pipe-bomb explosion at
Centennial Olympic Park on July 27, 1996, that killed one woman and
injured 111 people.
</P>
<P>
   Sukey S. Reid, a 55-year-old artist who lives in Nantahala,
Rudolph's boyhood home, said she was one of those who hoped that
the fugitive would be found and safely captured. But as she watched
six heavily armed agents climb into the woods this morning to begin
their daily search, she acknowledged feeling a certain empathy for
Rudolph, who has been on the FBI's list of the 10 most wanted
fugitives since May.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's human nature,'' she said. ``Yeah, we all know
he's bad. But there's something about a human being being hunted
down by dogs in the woods. It's like he's an animal. People say,
`Oh, the poor little guy.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Like many people here, Laurie D. Barlow, a 30-year-old tanning
salon owner, questions the case against Rudolph and argues that
some of the evidence linking him to a series of bombings must have
been planted.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's running now because he knows they're looking for a
scapegoat,'' she said. ``But he's a heck of a lot smarter than 200
FBI agents. They might be smart in the city but they sure don't
know the mountains.''
</P>
<P>
   Town leaders and others entrusted with protecting the area's
image are not proud of such sentiment, and they assert that it does
not represent anything close to a majority view.
</P>
<P>
   ``People around here don't condone what he's done,'' said Jim C.
Hutto, one of three barbers in Andrews and a member of the town
board. ``But the longer it goes on the more people lean toward him.
They think he's one man and they've got all these people and all
this sophisticated equipment looking for him. It sort of makes him
an underdog.''
</P>
<P>
   The perception of Rudolph as a sympathetic outlaw is prevalent
enough that the widow of the police officer who was killed in the
Birmingham attack came here Wednesday to confront some local
residents who in TV interviews have called Rudolph a folk hero.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a murderer, a terrorist,'' said Felecia Sanderson, whose
husband, Robert, was killed in an explosion Jan. 29 at the New
Woman All Women Health Care Clinic in Birmingham.
</P>
<P>
   The Asheville Citizen-Times, the nearest daily newspaper, also
took note of the area's ambivalence about Rudolph's capture in an
editorial on Tuesday. ``There's a natural inclination to root for
one man against the odds,'' the editorial observed. But in this
case, the newspaper said, such attitudes ``should dismay anyone who
wants to continue living in a country governed by law rather than
anarchy.''
</P>
<P>
   The division of opinion here is simply the latest oddity in a
case that has been bizarre from the beginning. This is the same
investigation that led Rudolph's older brother, Daniel, to produce
a videotaped message to the FBI in March that showed him using a
power saw to amputate his left hand.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI has offered a $1 million reward for Eric Rudolph, a
31-year-old carpenter whose family moved from south Florida into
these foggy hills when he was a teen-ager. He has been on the run,
presumably in the woods, since the day after the Birmingham
bombing, when police first identified him by tracing the license
plate number of a car seen by witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the multiagency task force that is pursuing Rudolph
announced that a hungry Rudolph had emerged from the woods on July
7 and made contact with George O. Nordmann, the owner of a health
food store in Andrews who has known Rudolph for years. Two days
later, Rudolph returned to Nordmann's house, which is deep in the
woods, and took a large quantity of food and Nordmann's blue 1977
Nissan pickup truck.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Nordmann, who was not home when the food and truck were taken,
did not report the encounter or the theft until July 11.
Investigators found the abandoned truck at a nearby campground on
July 13, setting off the nonstop, day-and-night manhunt.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Woody Enderson, the FBI agent leading the task
force, said that search teams had found a number of small campsites
that Rudolph may have used. At one such site, they found buried
trash that bore Rudolph's fingerprint. Enderson did not say how
long ago Rudolph may have been at the site, but other
law-enforcement officials said they believed he might have used it
more than two weeks ago to surveil Nordmann's house.
</P>
<P>
   Among the qualities that some residents find endearing about
Rudolph is his apparent consideration for Nordmann. He left five
$100 bills to pay for the food he purloined and left a handwritten
note in the truck identifying Nordmann as its owner,
law-enforcement officials have said.
</P>
<P>
   By now, the search has taken on the surreal quality of a daily
ritual, as has the interaction between the investigators and a
sizable encampment of journalists. Federal, state and local agents
gather each morning at the U.S. Forest Service's Appletree
campground, which has been transformed into a command post.
</P>
<P>
   As teams of six to eight agents leave the post for trails in
Tellico Gap or at the top of Winding Staircase Road, they are
followed by tire-screeching convoys of reporters and cameramen
desperate to send CNN and NBC their daily footage of agents with
their guns and dogs. The journalists film the agents as they
embark, but have respected the agents' requests that they be
allowed to search the woods alone.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, false sightings and fruitless leads have
become commonplace. On Tuesday night, a reported sighting _ later
proven erroneous _ sent investigators and reporters racing into the
darkness. On another day, when a gunshot was heard within the
30-square-mile search area, agents descended on a farmer who
explained that he was trying to exterminate a meddlesome rabbit.
</P>
<P>
   Here in nearby Andrews, the town of 2,500 where the
investigation is based, residents long for a return to the sleepy
normalcy of their purposefully peaceful lives. They complain that
the crush of television satellite trucks has made it hard to get a
parking spot near the post office. Motels are so booked that one
giddy proprietor joked that he was hiding Rudolph in a second-floor
guest room.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been good for business,'' Mayor Jim Dailey said. ``It's
helped the motels, the bed and breakfasts, the restaurants.''
</P>
<P>
   But some business owners fear that the Rudolph case and its
accompanying publicity may hurt the area in the long run. Already,
said John Paul Jones, the owner of the Bradley Inn in Andrews,
innkeepers and river rafting outfitters have received cancellations
from people who are scared to visit.
</P>
<P>
   Rudolph's recent contact with Nordmann has revived the area's
favorite parlor game, in which people debate whether they would
turn Rudolph in if he showed up on their doorsteps. Nordmann, who
has locked his store door and papered its windows with vitamin
advertisements, has not publicly explained his delay in notifying
officials.
</P>
<P>
   Law-enforcement authorities have neither charged nor criticized
Nordmann, at least partly because they do not want to discourage
witnesses from coming forward in the future. They have suggested
that Nordmann was scared and was wrestling with his conscience.
</P>
<P>
   A number of people interviewed here this week said they would
have to wrestle with theirs as well.
</P>
<P>
   Eddie P. Troy, a television repairman from Andrews, said he
thought that extreme tactics were justified to stop abortions and
that he would only report Rudolph for the reward money. ``I need
the money so I'd probably turn him in,'' Troy said. ``But if I
didn't need the money I'd probably let him go. He didn't do
anything to me personally. It's not my matter. That's the way
people think around here.''
</P>
<P>
   And Jeff W. May, a retired sawmill operator from Nantahala who
once employed Rudolph to do odd jobs at his house, said he, too,
was torn. ``I might try to talk him into surrendering,'' he said.
``And if he didn't I might just not tell anybody. I feel bad when
someone is down and out.''

FIRST-EVER CRIMINAL CONVICTION LEVIED IN FOOD POISONING CASE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Colo., Ill., Md., Pa., Wash., Canada)  (js) 
 By PAM BELLUCK   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ In what federal officials say is the first criminal
conviction in a food poisoning outbreak, Odwalla Inc. pleaded
guilty Thursday to violating federal food safety laws and agreed to
pay a $1.5 million fine for selling tainted apple juice that killed
a 16-month-old girl and sickened 70 other people in several states
in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   It is rare for federal officials to bring criminal charges in
cases like this, and the plea followed a lengthy investigation that
found that Odwalla, one of the nation's largest producers of fresh
juice, did not do enough to prevent contamination in its products.
Officials said Thursday that, as new kinds of dangerous bacteria
spread through the nation's food supply, they are expanding the
kinds of penalties and levers they can use to force companies to be
more rigorous in their safety practices.
</P>
<P>
   ``The settlement of this case today highlights the attention
that we pay to these very important issues,'' said Dr. Michael
Friedman, the acting commissioner of the Food and Drug
Administration, which helped prosecute the case. ``It highlights
the very substantial responsibilities that industries have for
products that are safe to the consumer.''
</P>
<P>
   Caroline Smith DeWaal, director of food safety for the Center
for Science in the Public Interest, an advocacy group, said the
settlement would be ``a good deterrent for other companies; it
certainly ups the ante in terms of companies that would have food
safety problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Odwalla, based in Half Moon Bay, Calif., pleaded guilty to 16
counts of unknowingly delivering ``adulterated food products for
introduction into interstate commerce'' in the October 1996
outbreak. In that outbreak, a batch of its juice infected with the
toxic bacteria E.coli O157:H7 sickened people in Colorado,
California, Washington and Canada. Fourteen children developed a
life-threatening disease that ravages kidneys.
</P>
<P>
   The $1.5 million penalty is the largest criminal penalty in a
food poisoning case, federal officials said. Of that amount,
$250,000 will go to a nonprofit food safety organization, Safe
Tables Our Priority, and to food safety research centers at
Pennsylvania State University and the University of Maryland.
Odwalla will also be on court-supervised probation for five years,
meaning that it will have to submit a detailed plan to the food and
drug agency demonstrating its food safety precautions and that any
subsequent violations could result in more serious charges, Federal
authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   ``No sentence or fine will ever mitigate the terrible tragedy
which lies at the heart of this case,'' said Joseph Johns, the
assistant U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of California, who
led the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Odwalla has settled more than a dozen civil suits, including
payments of more than $12 million to the families of the five
most-injured of the surviving children.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Gallagher, a spokesman for Odwalla, said the fine
``finalizes and puts a dollar figure to an incident that we took
responsibility for two years ago.'' He pointed out that ``Odwalla
is not being charged with any laws relating to the conditions or
cleanliness of our processing facility.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   He added: ``With respect to the size of our fine, we hope that
the visibility of that will raise awareness and send a message to
consumers about food safety.''
</P>
<P>
   Odwalla, which sells juices and nutritional shakes in the West,
Southwest and Midwest, became a success by capitalizing on the
growing U.S. taste for fresh-from-the-farm products. But it began
pasteurizing its apple juice after the outbreak, and hired experts
to overhaul its safety systems. Odwalla, which suffered substantial
losses after the outbreak, reported its first post-outbreak profits
last month. In June, the company reported net income of $140,000
for the third quarter, on sales of $15.4 million. It lost $1.8
million last year.
</P>
<P>
   Criminal charges in food safety cases are uncommon. It is often
difficult to determine the source of a food poisoning outbreak and,
once found, to assess how much responsibility suppliers,
manufacturers or distributors have for the contamination.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, authorities say, there are few criminal laws that
apply specifically to food safety.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Times reported in January that in the weeks before
the outbreak, Odwalla began relaxing its standards on accepting
blemished fruit and began to rein in the authority of its own
safety officials, according to company documents and interviews
with former Odwalla managers. By those accounts, on the day the
contaminated juice was pressed, production managers brushed aside
warnings from a company inspector that a batch of apples was too
rotten to use without taking special precautions against
contaminants.
</P>
<P>
   Odwalla officials have acknowledged that their safety systems
failed to keep out the E. coli, but they deny that the company took
any undue risks and say that, like many others in their industry,
they simply did not realize that E. coli O157:H7 could live in
apple juice.
</P>
<P>
   The Odwalla outbreak, along with several other recent cases of
wide-scale food poisoning, helped galvanize national attention
around food safety, prompting federal regulators to propose rules
that would require food processors to take new steps against
contamination.
</P>
<P>
   Until the Odwalla outbreak and a few others involving lettuce,
E. coli O157:H7 was primarily associated with an outbreak in 1993,
when four children died and more than 500 others became ill from
eating under-cooked hamburgers at the Jack in the Box fast-food
chain in the Pacific Northwest.
</P>
<P>
   This month, the Food and Drug Administration issued a rule
requiring makers of fresh fruit and vegetable juices to display
labels warning that, as unpasteurized products, they ``may contain
harmful bacteria that can cause serious illness in children, the
elderly, and persons with weakened immune systems.''

COLLEGES ASSESS TEACHER-CERTIFICATION FAILURE LIST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ELLEN O'BRIEN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Some of Massachusetts' best-known colleges had among
the highest failure rates on the new teacher certification test,
according to detailed scores released Thursday. The disappointed
schools vowed to revamp their curriculums in response.
</P>
<P>
   While it had been known that only 41 percent of candidates
overall passed the teacher test last April, the individual schools'
scores surprised and dismayed officials at colleges both public and
private.
</P>
<P>
   Among schools with a substantial number of students or graduates
who took the test, only 17.6 percent of candidates from
Northeastern passed; 36.5 percent of Lesley College candidates
passed, and 38.3 percent of Wheelock College candidates passed the
eight-hour exam, according to Department of Education figures.
</P>
<P>
   Even Boston University, whose chancellor John Silber, chairman
of the Board of Education, has lead the drive for improved teacher
quality, was disappointed: 65.7 percent of its candidates passed.
In a statement Thursday, Silber said that if Boston University
students do not manage a 90 percent pass rate within the next two
years, he will be among those recommending that BU close its school
of education.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not happy,'' said BU spokesman Kevin Carleton. ``Given
the much higher average'' SAT scores of ``our entering freshman, I
think we had hoped to do much better on the test than we did.''
</P>
<P>
   BU ranked second in percent who passed among schools with more
than 50 students taking the test. Boston College ranked first in
that group, with nearly 80 percent passing.
</P>
<P>
   The eight-hour exam tested would-be teachers in reading,
writing, and their concentration of study. The 1,800 candidates
taking the exam were mostly college seniors or recent graduates.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at Brandeis, Northeastern, and Clark University said
Thursday they are already planning signifigant curriculum changes,
especially in writing, based on their students' performances.
</P>
<P>
   ``These scores were a real gut check for us,'' said Northeastern
University spokeswoman Janet Hookailo. ``We are not going to step
back and wait for more test results. We have put all our teacher
education classes under administration review.''
</P>
<P>
   In the literacy portion of the exam, students from most schools
did far worse in writing than reading.
</P>
<P>
   While nearly 65 percent of 17 test takers from Northeastern
passed the reading portion of the exam, for instance, only 29.4
passed the writing.
</P>
<P>
   At schools where only a small number of students or graduates
took the exam, state education officials warned that the number
that passed may not be significant, or accurately reflect overall
standards. For example, the College of the Holy Cross in Worcester
did poorly, with fewer than half (44.4) of its candidates passing
the entire test, but it was only represented by nine test-takers.
All nine passed the reading and writing portions.
</P>
<P>
   The Harvard Graduate School of Education, with seven candidates,
and Wellesley College, with six, were the only two schools with no
failing grades. Tufts University, with 16 candidates, came in third
place, with 81.3 percent passing.
</P>
<P>
   The University of Massachusetts at Boston had a 41 percent pass
rate.
</P>
<P>
   In response to the scores, University of Massachusetts President
William M. Bulger issued a recommendation that students be required
to pass the test before they are allowed to start the student
teaching portion of their undergraduate work.
</P>
<P>
   At the University of Massachusetts at Amherst, officials were
unhappy to learn that 45 percent of their 130 candidates failed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were not as strong as we thought we would be,'' said UMass
Amherst spokesperson Kay Scanlon. ``But we need more detailed data
to see what we need to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still don't know how students' grade point averages compare
to how they did on the test. We need more information before we can
institute new programs.''
</P>
<P>
   At Brandeis, just over half of the 15 candidates who took the
test passed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The results are obviously not satisfactory for us,'' said
Dennis Nealon, Brandeis University spokesman. ``Brandeis would like
to see something much much closer to full passing. The university
will make it its business to have students perform better.'' But
Nealon, like others, said that deans would need more information
about the test before they could revamp college coursework. None of
the officials had seen the test, and many say they expected the
scores to rise from the second round of testing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't know exactly what the test is doing,'' Nealon said.
``There seems to be this cloak of secrecy about what exactly it's
testing.''
</P>
<P>
   BU officials say they will review the school grades of students
who passed and failed to see what changes should be made. Already,
it is clear that subject specialty classes such as math need to be
much tougher, spokesman Carleton said.
</P>
<P>
   Education Commissioner David Driscoll said there were no huge
suprises for state education officials because they were already
aware of the state's generally high failure rate. He said he hopes
the individual institutions can see their weaknesses as they sort
out scores.
</P>
<P>
   ``Generally speaking, the second giving of a test means that the
scores go up,'' Driscoll said. ``My hope is that it will go up.''

 &HT;    HBO &AMP; Co. sets second purchase of week, Imnet for $225 million
 &HT;    By Andy Miller
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- Atlanta-based HBO &AMP; Co. continued its two-week roller
coaster ride with the announcement Thursday of an agreement to
acquire Alpharetta-based Imnet Systems for about $225 million.
</P>
<P>
   The deal sent each company's shares sharply in opposite
directions. HBO &AMP; Co. shares sank $5.62 1/2, to $27.25, on volume
of about 24.7 million shares. It was the second most actively
traded stock on Wall Street. Imnet shares rose 32 percent, or $5.18
3/4, to $21.43 3/4 on volume about 10 times its daily average. It
was the second-biggest percentage gainer on Nasdaq.
</P>
<P>
   ``Strategically, it's a great fit,'' said analyst David Francis
of Volpe Brown Whelan. But the deal's timing and price, Whelan
said, raise questions for investors.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, merger talks collapsed between HBO &AMP; Co. and McKesson
Corp., a huge San Francisco-based drug wholesaler. Leaked
information of that stunning proposal caused the stock price of HBO
&AMP; Co., the largest health care software and services company, to
plunge.
</P>
<P>
   And Monday, the company announced it had agreed to buy US Servis
Inc. for $50 million in stock. The New Jersey-based firm provides
outsourcing services for physician delivery systems and hospital
business offices.
</P>
<P>
   Such acquisitions have helped HBO &AMP; Co. break the billion-dollar
revenue mark and accelerate past its competitors. On July 13, the
company announced record second-quarter profits.
</P>
<P>
   A software company, Imnet specializes in capturing paper medical
records and images and storing them electronically. The two
companies have been business partners since 1996, with HBO offering
Imnet products under its Pathways software line. A merger had been
the topic of speculation for at least a year.
</P>
<P>
   The deal, subject to regulatory and Imnet stockholder approval,
is expected to close in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Imnet shares recently have climbed after hitting a 52-week low
of $9.50 on June 2. It has annual revenues of about $50 million,
but lost money in two of the last three fiscal quarters.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do not like the valuation or the combination of this
acquisition,'' analyst Sharon Corr of Merrill Lynch told Bloomberg
Business News. She cut her rating of HBO &AMP; Co. to near-term
``accumulate'' from near-term ``buy.''
</P>
<P>
   News of the McKesson talks ``opened a Pandora's box of issues
not before examined by investors,'' Francis said. Those questions,
he said, include whether HBO &AMP; Co. can continue to expand operating
margins and make technology acquisitions.

 &HT;    300 jobs to disappear with the closing of Quebecor plant
 &HT;    By Bill Torpy
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- The former American Signature printing plant, which
experienced a bitter four-year strike that ended last year, will be
closed this fall, costing 300 jobs, a union representative said.
</P>
<P>
   It was purchased last year by the Canadian printing giant
Quebecor Printing. The plant prints catalogs.
</P>
<P>
   ``They'll phase out as business goes or as the help goes,'' said
Eugene Spraggs, 62, a pressman and union steward who has worked for
the company for 38 years. Spraggs, who earns about $18 an hour, was
told of the closing Thursday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no package, no severance. No vacation. No nothing.
It's rotten,'' he said. Quebecor spokesman Wayne Hanson would not
comment. ``There are meetings going on there through tomorrow
morning,'' he said. The strike started in 1993 after Fuji Bank of
Japan purchased the company and fired the entire work force but
rehired all but 47 union employees. It also reduced compensation by
nearly a third.
</P>
<P>
   The strike brought out hundreds of picketers, including civil
rights leader Jesse Jackson. It appeared to have ended last year
when a National Labor Relations Board administrative judge ruled
the strike was prompted by unfair labor practices, not wages.
</P>
<P>
   That meant, under federal law, strikers couldn't be replaced.
</P>
<P>
   However, many workers never returned to their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Spraggs and James Osborne, president of Local 96-B of the
Graphic Communications International Union, said Quebecor recently
met with the NLRB and issued a letter saying it was rehiring dozens
of workers who never returned to their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ultimately, it looks like they won,'' said Spraggs.

 &HT;    State Farm to cut state premiums
 &HT;    By Hank Ezell
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- State Farm's 1.4 million auto insurance customers in
Georgia are getting a break on their premiums.
</P>
<P>
   Insurance Commissioner John Oxendine on Thursday approved a 2.6
percent reduction, which will lower auto insurance costs by a total
of $21 million a year. Oxendine said State Farm, Georgia's largest
auto insurer, originally proposed to reduce rates by about $10
million.
</P>
<P>
   ``They showed some (customers) getting rate increases,''
Oxendine said. ``We felt those were inappropriate. We disallowed
those increases, which pretty much overall doubled the amount.''
</P>
<P>
   State Farm could not be immediately reached for comment. It was
the 15th and largest rate reduction approved by Oxendine's office
this year. The others totaled about $9 million. Some were as high
as 6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Oxendine attributed the cuts principally to increased
competition among auto insurers in Georgia. Other factors were the
improved economy, better law enforcement and safety on the
highways, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The $21 million in reductions also include a larger discount for
policyholders with 10 or more years of accident-free driving,
Oxendine said.
</P>
<P>
   Some policyholders with other types of State Farm coverage, such
as homeowners, may also receive an additional 5 percent discount.

 &HT;    Major stockholder wants Hayes to find 'strategic investor'
 &HT;    By Michael E. Kanell
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- Hayes Corp. officials Thursday remained silent in the
face of a call from an investor to consider putting the company up
for sale.
</P>
<P>
   The suggestion by James J. Cramer, manager of Cramer Capital,
comes at a time when the company stock is sliding and its sales
picture somewhat shaky. Cramer, also editor of a financial Web site
called The Street.com, has recently boosted his fund's share in the
Norcross-based company to about 8.4 percent of the outstanding
stock.
</P>
<P>
   Cramer said Hayes should seek a ``strategic investor'' or
perhaps look for a buyer, according to Bloomberg News.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at Hayes, whose stock has lost 82 percent of its value
this year, declined to comment. However, they said Cramer had not
contacted the company with any suggestions.
</P>
<P>
   Although Cramer Capital has 1.7 million shares, its leverage is
limited, since about 80 percent of Hayes stock is held by insiders.
Dennis Hayes, who founded the company and remains its chairman, is
the largest shareholder with 4.9 million shares of common stock,
according to papers filed with federal regulators. Other large
investors include Rinzai Ltd., Kaifa Ltd., Rolling Profit Holdings
Ltd., Lao Hotel Ltd., Saliendra Pte Ltd. and Qwek Investments Pte
Ltd.
</P>
<P>
   Hayes virtually invented the PC modem industry after its 1977
founding, but ran into trouble in the early 1990s and was forced
into bankruptcy protection.
</P>
<P>
   The company emerged from Chapter 11 with several strong quarters
of financial results, then began to struggle, laying off hundreds
of workers. Sales of the type of consumer modems the company was
built on have been erratic. With new technologies likely to replace
those modems in the next few years, the merger with Access Beyond
was engineered to give Hayes a chance to capitalize on the next
generation of devices for connecting computers to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Hayes has in recent months announced deals in which it will make
cable modems and devices that allow copper phone lines to transport
data at high speeds. However, revenues still suffer, and the
company's stock has slid slowly downward.
</P>
<P>
   Hayes stock closed Thursday at $2.31 1/4 a share, down from a
high of $12.56 1/4 on Dec. 31, the day Hayes merged with Access
Beyond.

FLOYD NOT QUITE CHICAGO BULLS COACH _ OR IS HE? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL HOLLEY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ Tim Floyd stood at a podium Thursday and officially
earned the right to say he is the next coach of the Chicago Bulls.
His new bosses, Jerrys Reinsdorf and Krause, even presented him
with a five-year contract reportedly worth $9 million. Simple
enough. That means his first United Center press conference
signaled his first day at work, right?
</P>
<P>
   Yes. And no.
</P>
<P>
   What this entire city knows by now is that former Iowa State
coach Floyd is the newest Bulls employee. But there is a
possibility he may not coach until the 21st century. Then again, he
could be the head man on the 21st day of next month. Reinsdorf and
Krause want to be sure that former coach Phil Jackson no longer
wants the job from which he resigned last month. So, the executives
announced, they are giving Floyd the title of director of
basketball operations. One day he will be their coach. In the
meantime, they say Jackson will be asked _ again _ to come back to
the six-time NBA champions.
</P>
<P>
   All parties acknowledged that their reason for delay is Michael
Jordan. He is on record as saying he doesn't want to play for any
coach but Jackson. Jordan also mentioned Floyd by name last week,
saying he didn't want to play for the 44-year-old career college
coach. That led to a meeting last Sunday among Reinsdorf, Krause,
and Floyd. The men said they came up with their compromise at that
time.
</P>
<P>
   Now the Bulls continue to say Floyd is their man. They say the
same thing about Jordan. And Jackson, too. That leaves them with a
new coach-in-residence; their former coach, who may be in the
Montana wilderness studying Zen; their superstar, who may or may
not be ``sticking to his guns'' and playing only for Jackson; and a
breakup of the team on hold.
</P>
<P>
   ``We concluded that nothing should stand in the way of our
desire to bring back the championship team,'' Reinsdorf said,
occasionally glancing at his prepared notes. ``We also reminded
ourselves that we had told Michael Jordan that he could take as
long as he wanted to recover from the grind from last season before
deciding if he wanted to play next season.''
</P>
<P>
   Thus, The Agreement. As you can imagine, the morning press
conference was preceded and succeeded by lively debates throughout
the city. The gist of one column in the Chicago Tribune: The Bulls
have done the right thing. The gist of another in the Sun-Times:
The Bulls are dolts.
</P>
<P>
   At the center of it all was Floyd, who could not sit still as
Reinsdorf spoke. He quickly emptied a bottle of water during the
executive's opening remarks. When it was time for him to speak,
Floyd _ accompanied by his wife, Beverly, 16-year-old daughter,
Shannon, and legendary Texas-El Paso coach Don Haskins _ said Bulls
fans can expect a man who is knowledgeable, energetic, and
forthright.
</P>
<P>
   Floyd also said he believes in defense, endearing himself to the
city's sports fans by referencing the 1985 Bears; he said he wants
to continue to run the Bulls' famed triangle offense; he asked the
media to ``give me a chance'' and not to refer to him as ``Jerry
Krause's boy,'' a phrase that has been uttered many times over the
last three years (supposedly, the two are fishing pals, although
Krause said Thursday they've put bait to hook together only ``maybe
three times'').
</P>
<P>
   He looked like a coach. He sounded like a coach (``To tell you
that I would not like to be a part of this team or its legacy would
be ridiculous; I would love to do that,'' and: ``There's not a lot
broken here''). But it was clear that he wasn't the coach. Yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Phil Jackson decides to return, Michael can have the coach
that he and we have always wanted him to have,'' Reinsdorf said. He
added, ``Should Phil not return by the end of the lockout, Tim will
succeed him as head coach of the Chicago Bulls. If Phil does
return, Tim will continue to serve as director of basketball
operations and would be involved in personnel matters, scouting,
and basketball business.''
</P>
<P>
   Krause was silent for much of the 40-minute briefing. He did say
that Floyd's lack of NBA experience was never a factor while citing
the championship (or near-championship) careers of former college
coaches Jack Ramsay, Dick Motta, and John MacLeod. Now the new
questions in Chicago:
</P>
<P>
   What's the likelihood of Jackson returning? Will Michael play
for Tim? How comfortable is Floyd with this?
</P>
<P>
   ``What is the possibility that Phil would come back? I have no
idea,'' Reinsdorf said. ``Every time we've asked him to come back,
he's said he doesn't want to come back. We'll give it a shot one
more time. Maybe Michael can talk him into it.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the issue of Jordan. Reinsdorf was spotted walking
out of Jordan's Chicago office Thursday _ ``I plead the Fifth,'' he
said _ leading to speculation that Jordan approves of the current
office structure. And Floyd said he called Buzz Petersen, a former
teammate of Jordan's, and asked him to find out what Jordan thought
of him. Petersen told Floyd that Jordan said, ``Tim, don't take
your name out of the running for the Bulls job.''
</P>
<P>
   That left the possibility, Floyd said, that ``Jordan could play
with me'' if Jackson says no again. And if Jackson says he doesn't
want Floyd around? ``I'll step away,'' the coach with the Southern
accent said.
</P>
<P>
   And yes, he is Coach Floyd. He just doesn't know when he'll be
able to call himself that without mentioning Jackson in the same
sentence.

<TEXT>
<P>
   ANDREWS, N.C. _ There is a part of this town that is rooting for
Eric Robert Rudolph to elude the camouflaged G-men and their
droopy-eared bloodhounds, and not just because the six-month search
for the man accused of bombing an Alabama abortion clinic has been
good for business.
</P>
<P>
   As search teams of rifle-toting agents fan through the dense
rhododendron of the Nantahala National Forest, there is a degree of
local pride in the ability of a ninth-grade dropout to outwit more
than 200 investigators equipped with motion detectors and
helicopters with heat sensors.
</P>
<P>
   Factor in an underlayer of anti-abortion sentiment and the
innate distrust of government that is native to the mountains of
western North Carolina and it begins to explain why a local man has
sold more than 200 T-shirts bearing the chant: ``Run Rudolph Run.''
</P>
<P>
   Rudolph has been charged in the Birmingham, Ala., attack, which
killed an off-duty police officer and seriously wounded a nurse.
The authorities want to question him about three other bombings in
Atlanta in 1996 and 1997, including the pipe-bomb explosion at
Centennial Olympic Park on July 27, 1996, that killed one woman and
injured 111 people.
</P>
<P>
   Sukey S. Reid, a 55-year-old artist who lives in Nantahala,
Rudolph's boyhood home, said she was one of those who hoped that
the fugitive would be found and safely captured. But as she watched
six heavily armed agents climb into the woods this morning to begin
their daily search, she acknowledged feeling a certain empathy for
Rudolph, who has been on the FBI's list of the 10 most wanted
fugitives since May.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's human nature,'' she said. ``Yeah, we all know
he's bad. But there's something about a human being being hunted
down by dogs in the woods. It's like he's an animal. People say,
`Oh, the poor little guy.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Like many people here, Laurie D. Barlow, a 30-year-old tanning
salon owner, questions the case against Rudolph and argues that
some of the evidence linking him to a series of bombings must have
been planted.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's running now because he knows they're looking for a
scapegoat,'' she said. ``But he's a heck of a lot smarter than 200
FBI agents. They might be smart in the city but they sure don't
know the mountains.''
</P>
<P>
   Town leaders and others entrusted with protecting the area's
image are not proud of such sentiment, and they assert that it does
not represent anything close to a majority view.
</P>
<P>
   ``People around here don't condone what he's done,'' said Jim C.
Hutto, one of three barbers in Andrews and a member of the town
board. ``But the longer it goes on the more people lean toward him.
They think he's one man and they've got all these people and all
this sophisticated equipment looking for him. It sort of makes him
an underdog.''
</P>
<P>
   The perception of Rudolph as a sympathetic outlaw is prevalent
enough that the widow of the police officer who was killed in the
Birmingham attack came here Wednesday to confront some local
residents who in TV interviews have called Rudolph a folk hero.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a murderer, a terrorist,'' said Felecia Sanderson, whose
husband, Robert, was killed in an explosion Jan. 29 at the New
Woman All Women Health Care Clinic in Birmingham.
</P>
<P>
   The Asheville Citizen-Times, the nearest daily newspaper, also
took note of the area's ambivalence about Rudolph's capture in an
editorial on Tuesday. ``There's a natural inclination to root for
one man against the odds,'' the editorial observed. But in this
case, the newspaper said, such attitudes ``should dismay anyone who
wants to continue living in a country governed by law rather than
anarchy.''
</P>
<P>
   The division of opinion here is simply the latest oddity in a
case that has been bizarre from the beginning. This is the same
investigation that led Rudolph's older brother, Daniel, to produce
a videotaped message to the FBI in March that showed him using a
power saw to amputate his left hand.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI has offered a $1 million reward for Eric Rudolph, a
31-year-old carpenter whose family moved from south Florida into
these foggy hills when he was a teen-ager. He has been on the run,
presumably in the woods, since the day after the Birmingham
bombing, when police first identified him by tracing the license
plate number of a car seen by witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the multiagency task force that is pursuing Rudolph
announced that a hungry Rudolph had emerged from the woods on July
7 and made contact with George O. Nordmann, the owner of a health
food store in Andrews who has known Rudolph for years. Two days
later, Rudolph returned to Nordmann's house, which is deep in the
woods, and took a large quantity of food and Nordmann's blue 1977
Nissan pickup truck.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Nordmann, who was not home when the food and truck were taken,
did not report the encounter or the theft until July 11.
Investigators found the abandoned truck at a nearby campground on
July 13, setting off the nonstop, day-and-night manhunt.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Woody Enderson, the FBI agent leading the task
force, said that search teams had found a number of small campsites
that Rudolph may have used. At one such site, they found buried
trash that bore Rudolph's fingerprint. Enderson did not say how
long ago Rudolph may have been at the site, but other
law-enforcement officials said they believed he might have used it
more than two weeks ago to surveil Nordmann's house.
</P>
<P>
   Among the qualities that some residents find endearing about
Rudolph is his apparent consideration for Nordmann. He left five
$100 bills to pay for the food he purloined and left a handwritten
note in the truck identifying Nordmann as its owner,
law-enforcement officials have said.
</P>
<P>
   By now, the search has taken on the surreal quality of a daily
ritual, as has the interaction between the investigators and a
sizable encampment of journalists. Federal, state and local agents
gather each morning at the U.S. Forest Service's Appletree
campground, which has been transformed into a command post.
</P>
<P>
   As teams of six to eight agents leave the post for trails in
Tellico Gap or at the top of Winding Staircase Road, they are
followed by tire-screeching convoys of reporters and cameramen
desperate to send CNN and NBC their daily footage of agents with
their guns and dogs. The journalists film the agents as they
embark, but have respected the agents' requests that they be
allowed to search the woods alone.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, false sightings and fruitless leads have
become commonplace. On Tuesday night, a reported sighting _ later
proven erroneous _ sent investigators and reporters racing into the
darkness. On another day, when a gunshot was heard within the
30-square-mile search area, agents descended on a farmer who
explained that he was trying to exterminate a meddlesome rabbit.
</P>
<P>
   Here in nearby Andrews, the town of 2,500 where the
investigation is based, residents long for a return to the sleepy
normalcy of their purposefully peaceful lives. They complain that
the crush of television satellite trucks has made it hard to get a
parking spot near the post office. Motels are so booked that one
giddy proprietor joked that he was hiding Rudolph in a second-floor
guest room.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been good for business,'' Mayor Jim Dailey said. ``It's
helped the motels, the bed and breakfasts, the restaurants.''
</P>
<P>
   But some business owners fear that the Rudolph case and its
accompanying publicity may hurt the area in the long run. Already,
said John Paul Jones, the owner of the Bradley Inn in Andrews,
innkeepers and river rafting outfitters have received cancellations
from people who are scared to visit.
</P>
<P>
   Rudolph's recent contact with Nordmann has revived the area's
favorite parlor game, in which people debate whether they would
turn Rudolph in if he showed up on their doorsteps. Nordmann, who
has locked his store door and papered its windows with vitamin
advertisements, has not publicly explained his delay in notifying
officials.
</P>
<P>
   Law-enforcement authorities have neither charged nor criticized
Nordmann, at least partly because they do not want to discourage
witnesses from coming forward in the future. They have suggested
that Nordmann was scared and was wrestling with his conscience.
</P>
<P>
   A number of people interviewed here this week said they would
have to wrestle with theirs as well.
</P>
<P>
   Eddie P. Troy, a television repairman from Andrews, said he
thought that extreme tactics were justified to stop abortions and
that he would only report Rudolph for the reward money. ``I need
the money so I'd probably turn him in,'' Troy said. ``But if I
didn't need the money I'd probably let him go. He didn't do
anything to me personally. It's not my matter. That's the way
people think around here.''
</P>
<P>
   And Jeff W. May, a retired sawmill operator from Nantahala who
once employed Rudolph to do odd jobs at his house, said he, too,
was torn. ``I might try to talk him into surrendering,'' he said.
``And if he didn't I might just not tell anybody. I feel bad when
someone is down and out.''

   When the Bulls' executives announced Tim Floyd as the team's
director of basketball operations _ a decision Jordan has not
supported _ they installed a surprising loophole.
</P>
<P>
   The Bulls offered to keep Floyd in the position of basketball
operations director if Phil Jackson, whose strained relationship
with management helped expedite his departure in June after the
Bulls won a sixth title, wanted to reconsider and return to coach
Jordan next season.
</P>
<P>
   But there was no evidence offered by Reinsdorf to suggest
Jackson would come back to Chicago as head coach. Jackson's agent,
Todd Musburger, said his client was ``flabbergasted'' at
Reinsdorf's comments during a Bulls' press conference held in
Chicago on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   That reaction left Reinsdorf's olive branch to Jackson viewed as
a public relation's ploy, and a way of deflecting blame should
Jordan remain steadfast in his stand to leave the Bulls unless
Jackson is the coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so transparent and so disingenuous and so much the result
of this spin doctoring, if you will,'' Musburger said of
Reinsdorf's appeal to Jackson. ``There isn't an ounce of legitimacy
to what was said. Are we to believe that Phil, the head coach, and
Floyd, the coach to be, would occupy the same space in that
organization? It is positively ludicrous.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once again, they have proved their skill at sucking the joy
out of the moment. Floyd should have been properly praised and
announced. Instead, he had to pretend he was window dressing.''
</P>
<P>
   The day ended up as another addition to the soap opera saga in
Chicago, where dysfunction and turmoil has threatened to end a
dynasty before old age ever has a chance. In the middle of it all
is Floyd.
</P>
<P>
   After signing a five-year deal worth $2 million a year, Floyd,
who resigned as head coach of Iowa State on Wednesday, stood at a
podium in Chicago's United Center and talked about his desire to
work in concert with Jordan, and, if necessary, with Jackson as
well.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would step completely away if Phil wanted,'' said Floyd, a
defensive-oriented coach with no NBA experience who had a 243-130
record as a collegiate coach. ``I would not take this job if I
thought it would push Michael Jordan out. This is about Michael's
wishes.''
</P>
<P>
   The news of Floyd's hire did not disrupt Jordan's summer passion
Thursday. He was on a golf course in suburban Chicago and
unavailable for comment. But throughout the Bulls' search for a
coach, Jordan repeated his unwillingness to play for a young coach
like Floyd, whose fishing-buddy relationship with Krause is
considered another strike against Jackson's replacement.
</P>
<P>
   Floyd recognized this as he asked everyone to restrain
themselves from calling him ``Krause's boy.'' Floyd also asked
everyone to give him a chance, including Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Phil doesn't return, I hope Michael will come back and play
for me,'' Floyd said. ``I really do.''
</P>
<P>
   Jordan has said he will not make a decision about his future
until after the National Basketball Association's lockout ends. In
one way, Reinsdorf also appealed to Jordan to help coax Jackson
back into the fold.
</P>
<P>
   ``What are the possibilities that Phil would come back? I have
no idea,'' Reinsdorf said. ``Every time I've asked him to come back
he's said he doesn't wanna come back, but we're going to try one
more time. And maybe Michael can talk to him.''
</P>
<P>
   Floyd also wants to talk to Jordan. Through a feeling out
process, he hopes to gain Jordan's respect and help him understand
how their relationship could work. However, the owner-imposed
lockout prohibits teams from having conversations with players.
</P>
<P>
   There may be a way around the situation by using third parties,
but from his earlier comments, it would seem Jordan has little
interest in getting to know Floyd.
</P>
<P>
   Unless Jackson has a drastic change of heart, or unless the
Bulls retreat from their position that only Floyd will coach if
Jackson does not, Floyd is their man. He has been waiting in the
wings for two years although Reinsdorf said he offered Jackson a
chance to return for another year before he departed Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, he made the offer, but after Phil had spent two days
packing up his office,'' Musburger said. ``So if you're really
sincere about keeping someone you truly value, do you announce his
contract in the summer of 1997 as the last deal the Bulls will ever
do with you? And along the way, will you say to him in private, I
don't care if you win 82 games, you are not coming back? Is that
the way you treat a man you want to return?''
</P>
<P>
   With Jackson's return so improbable, Floyd may be left to coach
a championship team with an entirely different face next year, one
without Jordan and free agents Scottie Pippen and Dennis Rodman. It
would be as if Bulls' fans would have to go cold turkey after a
decade of watching their team carry on as the dominant franchise in
the league.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing hasn't changed,'' Reinsdorf said. ``We want to bring
everyone back and we want to win a seventh championship. We'll do
everything we can to win it and to bring everybody back.
Unfortunately, it's not just a matter of Phil, it's Michael and
Scottie and all the free agents. We have to be ready to field a
team next season. We have to have a coach in place.'' &QL;

CAMPO WON'T REQUIRE THAT CRYING TOWEL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By JIM REEVES 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WICHITA FALLS, Texas _ It is 11 a.m. under a blazing sun
alongside the Cowboys' practice field, the morning session has just
ended and Dave Campo leads a platoon of sweaty, exhausted players
to an adjacent fence, where fans are lined up 10 deep for
autographs.
</P>
<P>
   He signs for 20 minutes, grabbing caps and pennants, yearbooks
and handout rosters, chatting amiably with fans eager to get close
to a real Cowboys coach.
</P>
<P>
   What most of them don't realize is that they just don't get any
more real than the Cowboys' defensive coordinator.
</P>
<P>
   Considering that it was only a few months ago that Campo didn't
even get within sniffing distance of his dream job _ the one Chan
Gailey wound up with _ and that he is essentially in the process of
rebuilding key elements of the Cowboys' defense from scratch, he is
in remarkably good humor these days.
</P>
<P>
   Remarkable, that is, if you didn't know the resilient,
forward-looking Campo.
</P>
<P>
   The first thought in preparation for a Campo interview is to
check the essentials. Notepad, pen, microcassette recorder, hanky,
sedative, sympathetic look.
</P>
<P>
   Check, check and check.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, you can check the last three items at the door. Campo
doesn't need your sympathy or mine. A run-stopper in the defensive
line and someone to replace Brock Marion, perhaps, but no crying
towels are necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, Gailey, a coordinator from another organization, got the
job Campo would crawl across Texas in the middle of summer for, but
he is wasting no time in feeling sorry for himself.
</P>
<P>
   Loyal to a fault, Campo got lip service from the media during
the Cowboys' coaching search, but not even an official interview
with owner Jerry Jones, who had his sights set on an
offensive-minded head coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``Campo has as good a feel for the overall picture as any coach
I've ever been around,'' Jones says flatly. ``He has a head coach's
view of what's best for the team.''
</P>
<P>
   Campo's expertise, of course, is defense. He owns the Super Bowl
hardware _ and Jones' undying gratitude _ to prove it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The one thing I understand is timing and the right situation
and those kinds of things,'' Campo says. ``I feel like I've got
respect from this organization, and that's the thing I'm most
interested in.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm all about winning, No. 1. The only thing that's really
important to me right now is 6-and-10. I don't like 6-and-10. I
like winning football games. As long as I have the respect of the
organization and Chan Gailey, that's all that matters.''
</P>
<P>
   Always a class act, Campo swallowed his pride and put his own
dreams on hold when Gailey first arrived at Valley Ranch.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told Chan when he came in for his interview, `If you're the
head coach here, I've got my eye on the bull's eye, and I
understand the chain of command.' If the best I do is to be the
(defensive) coordinator of the Dallas Cowboys, I couldn't be with a
better organization,'' Campo said.
</P>
<P>
   Jones and the Cowboys are lucky to have him. So is Gailey. About
to enter his 10th year with the Cowboys and fourth as the defensive
coordinator, Campo provides the head coach a much-needed security
blanket, allowing Gailey to concentrate on putting in the team's
new offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope he feels that way,'' Campo says. ``I like him. He came
in without a lot of fanfare, but he's a very solid individual as a
person and he wants to be a head football coach. He's not settling
for just calling offensive plays,
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not very involved with the defense right now, but I
guarantee you that he will be. He knows defense. He knows what
we're doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Gailey, Campo says, is a dash of Jimmy Johnson combined with a
heavy dollop of Tom Landry. And that's an exciting combination.
</P>
<P>
   ``The point I'm making, is when it gets down to the nitty
gritty, if we don't do something right defensively, he's going to
have a question about it,'' Campo said. ``And I like that. All we
care about is what's the best way to get it done and win. I've
always been that way, which is probably why I'm here through three
(head) coaches. I'm flexible.''
</P>
<P>
   There are a number of questions for a Cowboys' defense that
finished first against the pass but 24th against the run in the NFL
last season. Gone are starting defensive ends Tony Tolbert and
Shante Carver, which isn't all bad. In are speedy but raw Kavika
Pittman and rookie first-round draft pick Greg Ellis.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're going to be more athletic than we've been in the
past,'' Campo says. ``That has to convert to being playmakers. Time
will tell as far as how much progress they make, but I'll take guys
that are hungry, and can run, and are athletic.''
</P>
<P>
   Six opposing running backs rushed for 100 or more yards in games
against the Cowboys last season, led by Green Bay's Dorsey Levens,
who littered the field with would-be tacklers en route to 190 yards
on 33 carries in late November. After that, teams pounded
mercilessly at the soft underbelly of the Cowboys' defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to slow down the run better than we did last year,''
Campo said. ``It got out of hand at the end. If we can get the ball
to the perimeter, we're going to be OK because we've got some speed
that can run it down.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where you get into trouble is with the teams that can just
pound you inside. So having Leon Lett back, the emergence of a
Darren Benson, the improvement of Antonio Anderson, a Michael
Myers, plus Chad Hennings being a steady, solid, NFL player, it's
got to come from those guys. We've got to be physical inside and
then go from there to the outside. And Fred Strickland's got to
have a good year at middle 'backer.''
</P>
<P>
   As usual, Campo's plate is brimming. There's no time to feel
sorry for himself, and if he won't, we won't either.
</P>
<P>
   Care to split a Prozac with me?

NO JAIL FOR REPORTER REFUSING TO REVEAL SOURCES, JUDGE RULES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Edits thruout)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS C. PALMER JR.  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Boston Globe medical reporter Richard A. Knox avoided
being sent to jail for contempt of court Thursday, as a Superior
Court judge took under advisement a motion asking that Knox be
forced to reveal confidential sources in a libel case.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a waste of a good jail cell,'' said Judge Peter Lauriat,
who previously has ordered Knox to reveal his sources. ``Jail is
always a possibility but is not frankly useful in this case.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Lauriat suggested that he might fine the Globe, a
codefendant in the lawsuit, an amount that after a period would
double daily until Knox or the newspaper disclosed the information.
</P>
<P>
   The case involves an article Knox wrote in March 1995 about the
1994 death of Globe medical columnist Betsy A. Lehman, who died
from an overdose of chemotherapy. Knox's article named Dr. Lois
Ayash, then at Dana-Farmer Cancer Institute, as one of the doctors
or nurses who had signed the flawed medication order.
</P>
<P>
   Ayash is suing Dana-Farber as well as Knox and the Globe, saying
she was unfairly blamed for Lehman's death. She had not signed the
order. The Globe published a correction in June 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Ayash has sought to force Knox to reveal his
confidential sources. The Globe has said it misread a copy of the
written order and did not rely on confidential sources for that
part of the article.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's hearing was held inside a sweltering courtroom in
Lowell (Mass.) Superior Court, where Lauriat now presides.
``Welcome to hell,'' he quipped. The two parties then spent about
an hour restating their arguments.
</P>
<P>
   In February, Lauriat ordered Knox to reveal the sources, saying
reporters enjoy no special protection from having to provide
information in court cases. Knox has refused.
</P>
<P>
   In previous, unrelated cases, the Supreme Judicial Court has
upheld such protection for reporters, and Globe executives have
said they would appeal any action forcing Knox to relinquish his
sources.
</P>
<P>
   Ayash is charging defamation and libel, among other allegations.
Her lawyer, Joan A. Lukey of Hale and Dorr, said the identities of
Knox's sources are necessary for Ayash to pursue her suits against
the Globe and Dana-Farber.
</P>
<P>
   ``The court did a balancing test,'' Lukey said Thursday, by
measuring the rights of the newspaper against Ayash's need for the
information. ``We need relief.''
</P>
<P>
   Lukey proposed a civil contempt finding against Knox and a
$1,000-a-day fine against the Globe. As an alternative, Lukey asked
the judge to enter a libel finding against the newspaper, as if a
trial had been held, with damages to be determined later.
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan M. Albano of Bingham Dana, representing the Globe,
suggested that Lauriat respond to Knox's refusal only by
disallowing the use of material provided by the confidential
sources in any libel trial.
</P>
<P>
   Albano argued that the legal rule under which Lauriat is being
asked to hold Knox in contempt requires ``the punishment fit the
crime.''
</P>
<P>
   Responding to the judge's indication that he wasn't
contemplating jail, Knox said, ``I'm relieved. My wife will be very
happy, too.
</P>
<P>
   Alfred S. Larkin Jr., Globe vice president and assistant to the
publisher, said, ``Any time a judge decides not to send a reporter
to jail to protect a confidential source, it's a good outcome.''
</P>
<P>
   Lauriat said he would consider Thursday's arguments and rule
later on the motion.

BORDER AGENTS REUNITE HOUSTON MOTHER, CHILDREN AFTER BOTCHED
SMUGGLING ATTEMPT 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Eds.: A tilde is needed over n in Ordonez) 
 
By JAMES PINKERTON 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORT ISABEL, Texas _ A young Honduran immigrant Thursday ended
an anxious monthlong wait on smugglers who were to deliver her two
young children to Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of meeting with smugglers, however, Esmeralda Ordonez
and her fiance wept as U.S. Border Patrol agents reunited her with
her 2-year-old son and 6-year-old daughter. The smugglers,
evidently spooked by an intensive search by federal agents, gave up
on attempts to extort more money from Ordonez and abandoned the boy
in a Brownsville apartment complex at 2 a.m. with a telephone
number pinned to the toddler's shirt.
</P>
<P>
   Neither the boy nor his sister, who had been found Tuesday
night, was harmed. The children shyly answered reporters' questions
during their reunion with mom and appeared to be in good shape.
</P>
<P>
   But, the tearful couple said they had been held for more than a
month by members of a smuggling ring who had been paid $7,000 but
wanted $3,500 more to complete the trip from Honduras to Houston.
</P>
<P>
   The original price was $5,000 and the trip was to take eight
days, Ordonez, 24, said at the U.S. Border Patrol station near Port
Isabel, a fishing community of 5,000 people about 25 miles
northeast of Brownsville near the U.S.-Mexico border.
</P>
<P>
   ``They threatened if we didn't send the money, they were going
to do something to the little girl,'' said Luis Enrique Sandoval,
32, a Houston construction worker who has dated Ordonez, who is in
the country illegally, for nine months and plans to marry her when
his own divorce is final.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's when we started worrying,'' he continued, fighting back
tears. ``They were telling us if we didn't send them the money _
the $3,500 _ that we would never see the kids anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Border Patrol officials who helped recover the young siblings
said it has become increasingly common for smugglers to transport
children without their parents, pairing them up with other clients
who claim to be relatives. Smugglers are aware that South Texas
immigration officials have limited facilities in which to detain
whole families, and often release illegal immigrants on bond after
giving them a court date.
</P>
<P>
   ``It comes in spurts,'' said supervisory agent Francisco Lopez
of the Border Patrol. ``Sometimes we'll have several unaccompanied
juveniles in, say, a week's time and then we won't see any more for
two or three weeks, and all of a sudden we'll run into another
handful of them.''
</P>
<P>
   The search for Ordonez's children ended when Juan Angel
Maradiaga, 2, was found wandering by himself outside a Brownsville
apartment complex around 2 a.m. after authorities received an
anonymous call about the toddler, Lopez said.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday night, agents found his older sister, Vanelisa
Maradiaga, 6, with a group of more than 20 illegal immigrants
staying in several rooms in a hotel in downtown Brownsville. A
woman in the group first claimed to be the girl's mother but later
admitted that smugglers told her to lie, Lopez said.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier that day, the children's mother had asked Sandoval to
contact Houston police and FBI agents and alert them the smugglers
threatened to harm her children if the extra $3,500 was not sent to
Brownsville.
</P>
<P>
   In Houston, FBI spokesman Rolando Moss confirmed agents were
involved in running down leads and assisting Customs and Border
Patrol agents working the case in the Rio Grande Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Ordonez said she works as a saleswoman at a ladies clothing shop
in a Houston mall and has been in the United States for 16 months
without immigration papers. She decided to have her two children,
who were living with her sister in the town of Olancho in Honduras,
brought to Houston because she feared her ex-husband in California
was planning to take custody of them.
</P>
<P>
   Her former brother-in-law recommended a smuggler from El
Salvador.
</P>
<P>
   ``My brother-in-law told me (the smuggler) brings in little
children and there wouldn't be a single problem,'' Ordonez said.
``And also (the smuggler) called me and said, `Look lady, nothing
will happen to your children. You'll have them over there in eight
days' and this and that.''
</P>
<P>
   Ordonez said she sent the smuggler $2,000 as a deposit and her
two children left Honduras on June 18 for what was to be an
eight-day trip to Houston. She got calls for more money from El
Salvador where, she said, her children were held for two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Border Patrol agents said no arrests have been made of those
responsible for smuggling the two children across the border.
</P>
<P>
   Ordonez and her two children were detained for immigration
processing but could be released and allowed to return to Houston
to stay with Sandoval, officials said. If the couple marries, they
added, Sandoval, who is a citizen, could apply for legal residency
for Ordonez and the children.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to lose them,'' Sandoval said.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Democratic governor of Puerto Rico, pushing for
a chance for his island to vote for statehood, has come up with a
tempting sales pitch for the Republican-controlled Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine a place, Gov. Pedro Rossello and his lobbyists say, that
allows prayer in school, opposes abortion, hands out vouchers so
children can attend parochial schools, has sliced capital-gains
taxes and is busy privatizing many of its major industries. That
place, they add, hoping to clinch the deal, is Puerto Rico.
</P>
<P>
   ``Puerto Rico passed the Contract With America,'' said an
important congressional backer, Sen. Larry Craig, R-Idaho. It is a
point Craig never fails to make to incredulous colleagues as he
pushes his legislation for a congressionally sanctioned referendum
on Puerto Rico's status.
</P>
<P>
   It is an uphill battle to persuade his fellow Republican
senators, and especially the majority leader, Sen. Trent Lott,
R-Miss., to take the chance that Puerto Rico will not, as a state,
send two Democratic senators and six Democratic representatives to
Washington. That fear, along with the fact that Puerto Rico is a
Spanish-speaking island, has kept the Republican Congress from
moving quickly to implement the party's 1996 platform, which said
``we support the right of the U.S. citizens of Puerto Rico to be
admitted to the Union as a fully sovereign state after they freely
so determine.''
</P>
<P>
   To get the party to live up to that pledge, the governor is
trying to convince them of two things: that the island will make a
stellar 51st state, and that Puerto Ricans will not necessarily
vote for Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   It is a message that other statehood supporters are working,
too. Just last month, Jack Marquez, a Puerto Rican who was
decorated for his service in the Vietnam War, established the
Puerto Rican American Foundation here. The lobbying group, which is
modeled on the influential Cuban American National Foundation and
works independently of the Puerto Rican government, aims to spread
the gospel about Puerto Rico's conservative conversion.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very conservative society,'' Marquez said. ``Not a
`West Side Story,' welfare-cheating society as it is portrayed in
some circles.''
</P>
<P>
   His group recently ran an ad on conservative talk shows
supporting a Republican bill for education tax credits, saying,
``If school choice can work in Puerto Rico, it will work for
America.''
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of statehood say the Republican image is not as pure
as Rossello and his supporters have presented it. Puerto Rico also
has strict gun control laws and a universal health care system.
``And we still have the view that the government is the most
important player guaranteeing social justice for the people,'' said
Anibal Acevedo Vila, president of the Popular Democratic Party,
which supports keeping a variation of the current commonwealth
status. In other words, despite the governor's recent efforts, many
people love big government, Avevedo Vila said.
</P>
<P>
   In March, the U.S. House of Representatives voted 209-208 to set
Puerto Rico self-determination in motion. The 10-year process would
begin with a referendum allowing Puerto Ricans to choose among
three options _ independence, statehood or commonwealth status.
</P>
<P>
   The bill was supported by proponents of statehood, including
Rossello and both houses of the Legislature, as well as the
relatively small faction supporting independence. But it was
vigorously opposed by commonwealth backers, who said the bill, in
putting forward a narrow definition of commonwealth for the
referendum, was unfairly slanted toward statehood.
</P>
<P>
   Now the onus is on the U.S. Senate. Lott has said there is
simply not enough time this year to grapple with an issue as
contentious as Puerto Rico's self-determination. But Sen. Frank
Murkowski, R-Alaska, who heads the Committee on Energy and Natural
Resources and vividly remembers Alaska's own struggle for
statehood, is forging ahead with a streamlined bill that, at the
very least, would allow for a referendum and a set of approved
definitions.
</P>
<P>
   Republican pollsters and consultants have advised members to
seize on the issue of Puerto Rican self-determination, saying it is
a natural for Hispanic voters and one that tracks with the party's
support of statehood.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hispanics in this country hold many of the same virtues and
values as Republicans, but they continue to feel alienated by what
they characterize as the close-mindedness on the part of
Republicans in their approach to governing,'' two Republican
pollsters, Ed Goeas and William Stewart, wrote in a report on a
national study of Hispanic attitudes.
</P>
<P>
   The issue is complicated, especially in an election year,
confronting as it does questions of language and cultural identity.
Puerto Rico is predominantly a Spanish-speaking country, although
English is routinely spoken in government and business, and has a
distinct culture.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one should assume that the road to a status change will be
short or smooth,'' Murkowski warned at a recent hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Spain ceded Puerto Rico to the United States in 1898 after the
Spanish-American War. Congress granted citizenship to Puerto Ricans
in 1917 and made the island a commonwealth in 1952. Puerto Rico has
its own laws, taxes and government. Puerto Ricans who live on the
island are subject to U.S. military service, but do not pay federal
taxes, cannot vote for presidential or congressional candidates,
and are not entitled to most federal benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Puerto Ricans are almost equally split between statehood and
commonwealth status. Relatively few favor independence.
</P>
<P>
   ``At least 75 percent of Puerto Rican voters align themselves
with status options rather than candidates, programs or solutions
to pressing problems,'' Murkowski said. ``This orientation distorts
governance.''
</P>

<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   One important battle over the referendum bill centers on how to
define ``commonwealth.'' Commonwealth supporters pushed for a broad
definition that would guarantee American citizenship, among other
things. The House rejected that definition, and now commonwealth
backers say they will boycott the referendum, if it comes to pass.
Statehood supporters say a definition guaranteeing citizenship is
unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   Without a guarantee of U.S. citizenship, most Puerto Ricans,
even those who see economic advantages in commonwelath status, are
likely to vote for statehood.
</P>
<P>
   In pressing their case for a referendum, which they believe will
lead to statehood and greater economic prosperity on the island,
Rossello and his chief lobbyist, Xavier Romeu, have painstakingly
listed the governor's chief accomplishments since 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Rossello has privatized the government-owned shipping industry,
the hotel industry, and most recently, the telephone industry. He
has cut the capital gains tax to 7 percent from 20 percent. He has
slashed welfare spending by 20 percent, and made both English and
Spanish official languages. And Puerto Rico has seen a 19 percent
reduction in the personal income tax.
</P>
<P>
   The pitch does not thrill Democrats of Puerto Rican descent.
Rep. Jose Serrano, D-N.Y., a liberal who supports the referendum,
practically grimaces at the thought of Puerto Rico as a
conservative bastion, describing it as pandering. ``You do so much
to please the master,'' said Serrano, who calls Puerto Rico the
last U.S. colony. ``People are desperate to make their point. It's
like we can make you guys wish you had another 50 states just like
us.''

DRUG SCANDAL WIDENS EVEN AS TOUR RIDERS GET A DAY OFF 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By SAMUEL ABT    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TARASCON SUR ARIEGE, France _ Even as the race rested for its
single day off, the drug scandal enveloping professional bicycle
racing and the Tour de France widened Thursday as three more
officials and nine riders of a French team were taken into judicial
custody and four officials of a Dutch team were being questioned by
police.
</P>
<P>
   The three officials of the Festina team based in France are two
assistant coaches, Miguel Moreno and Michel Gros, and the team's
manager, Joel Chabiron. Also held were the nine riders of the
sport's top-ranked team who started the Tour on July 11 in Dublin,
Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   They include two former favorites in the world's major bicycle
race, Richard Virenque and Alex Zulle, and the road race champion,
Laurent Brochard.
</P>
<P>
   They all were ordered detained in Lyons pending a judge's
decision whether to place them under formal investigation. They
were not placed under formal arrest but were due to spend the night
in a police station.
</P>
<P>
   The riders were expelled from the race late Friday after their
coach said from jail that he had supplied them with such illegal
performance-enhancing drugs as the artificial hormone EPO. They
have denied any guilt.
</P>
<P>
   The team's jailed doctor has said that the riders contributed
$70,000 to a pool to buy the drugs, which they have denied.
</P>
<P>
   The Festina officials and riders in custody joined the team's
coach, its doctor and a veteran masseur, who have been arrested in
the last two weeks after an official team car was seized at the
French-Belgian border on July 8 and found to contain what has been
described as a huge quantity of illegal performance-enhancing
drugs.
</P>
<P>
   In a similar case, a car bearing the insignia of the TVM team
from the Netherlands was seized by police in March near Rheims,
France, and said to be bearing drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Although two mechanics were arrested and the artificial hormone
EPO was found, the case languished until Thursday morning. About 8
a.m., according to Guido van Calster, TVM's team manager and a
former Tour rider, ``the police arrived at our hotel while we were
at breakfast and took away'' the team's coach, Cees Priem, its
doctor, Andre Michalov, and an unidentified mechanic.
</P>
<P>
   An assistant coach, Hendrik Redant, was brought in for
questioning later in the day.
</P>
<P>
   Redant and the unnamed mechanic were later released while Priem
and Michalov were still being held Thursday evening in the police
station in the village of Pamiers, where the TVM team was staying
at the Hotel de la Rocade.
</P>
<P>
   Tour officials had no immediate comment.
</P>
<P>
   After Bruno Roussel, the Festina coach, said in a statement
through his lawyer last Friday that he had conducted a concerted
program to supply drugs to his riders, Tour officials expelled the
nine-man team. It ranks first in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Those nine riders were called into court in Lyons on Thursday to
aid the investigation. It has been conducted by police officers
from Lille, the northern city where Roussel, Dr. Eric Ryckaert, the
Festina team doctor, and Willy Voet, a masseur, are scheduled to
appear Friday in court.
</P>
<P>
   TVM started the year in eighth position among the approximately
40 professional racing teams. Its annual budget, supplied by an
insurance company, is a bit below $4 million, or $2 million less
than Festina, which is sponsored by a watch manufacturer.
</P>
<P>
   Tour officials said Wednesday that they had no plans to expel
the seven TVM riders remaining of the nine that started the race.
The reason, the officials said, was that no formal charges had been
brought against anybody on the team and that no official had said
the team was involved with drugs, unlike the Festina case.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Addressing a report Thursday morning in the newspaper Le
Parisien, a judge in Ghent, Belgium, Eric Van de Sijpe, said that
he could confirm that the Festina riders had used EPO. It
multiplies the red blood corpuscles that carry oxygen to muscles
and is mainly used in endurance sports.
</P>
<P>
   EPO has also been blamed anecdotally in nearly two dozen deaths
of amateur and professional riders this decade. Because EPO
thickens the blood and because riders have pulse rates half that of
most other people, the hormone is believed to cause heart attacks
while the riders sleep.
</P>
<P>
   No known tests exist to detect EPO, which is a drug for patients
on kidney dialysis. The International Cycling Union, which governs
the sport, has been testing riders' levels of red blood corpuscles
for the last two years, suspending for two weeks any riders found
to have a level above 50 percent of their blood. Seven riders have
been caught this season and about a dozen last year.
</P>
<P>
   Van de Sijpe conducted an inquiry in March into a pharmacist who
was found to have sold large quantities of EPO and among his
alleged buyers was Ryckaert of Festina. His computer records were
copied by the judge.
</P>
<P>
   ``I seized the riders' medical files and in them there are
indications that they took EPO,'' news agencies quoted the judge as
having said. ``It's there in writing.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Festina officials and riders have charged that they have
been made scapegoats for a practice that is widespread in the pack.
</P>
<P>
   Qualified confirmation was made by Dr. Max Testa, the Asics team
doctor and former doctor for the 7-Eleven team and its successor,
Motorola, which left the sport in 1996. In an interview, he said,
``I'm not really in a good position to say since I was working 11
years with American teams and they're clean.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In Europe, drug use is quite prevalent. I would say at least
20 to 30 percent of professional riders do it. Part of the reason
is the pressure of all the races, the difficulty of finding a job.
You always have to be good. EPO, even if it is not detectable, is a
strong risk for riders because there is a lot of data about how
dangerous it is.
</P>
<P>
   ``The general situation is probably that it is mainly used by
the weakest riders. They're the ones who feel they need an edge.'' &QL;

 &HT;    Visa is Atlanta's choice
 &HT;    By Maria Saporta
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- Sorry American Express. Atlanta prefers Visa.
</P>
<P>
   That's the message that the Atlanta Convention and Visitors
Bureau will be sending out as part of its marketing program.
</P>
<P>
   Visa was able to get the ACVB to spread that message through an
agreement to extend and expand a marketing partnership that began
in 1993. The new three-year partnership is estimated to have a $3
million value in both cash and in-kind contributions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We as a bureau have just signed the biggest agreement we have
ever had as an organization,'' said Bill Howard, ACVB's vice
president of public relations and tourism.
</P>
<P>
   Before the Olympics, Visa and ACVB agreed to a $3 million
partnership extended over five years.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest increase in the Visa partnership will be an annual
$300,000 cash contribution to ACVB's cultural tourism campaign,
which already has BellSouth and Coca-Cola as sponsors.
</P>
<P>
   It was the cultural tourism piece that placed Visa's Atlanta
partnership bid ahead of American Express.
</P>
<P>
   In order to be able to use the slogan ``Atlanta prefers Visa,''
the credit card company has to dominate the market. Rob Robins,
Visa's executive vice president for marketing development and
acceptance, did not give specifics on local market share.
</P>
<P>
   ``Atlanta is a very strong market for us,'' Robins said. ``We
have over 50 percent market share in the United States. What we
hope to do is expand our total volume in Atlanta.''
</P>
<P>
   American Express has made strong inroads in the Atlanta market.
Through its Delta Skymiles credit card, consumers get frequent
flier points on the airline when they use American Express. Given
the concentration of Delta customers in Atlanta, the Skymiles card
is particularly popular here.
</P>
<P>
   The competition between the two credit card companies here is
intense.
</P>
<P>
   At a Metro Atlanta Chamber of Commerce lunch Wednesday with the
Arts &AMP; Business Council, the main speaker was Mary Beth Salerno,
president of the American Express Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   Spurgeon Richardson, president of the ACVB, said he did not
attend that lunch (despite ACVB's cultural tourism program) because
he was in meetings with Visa executives.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we sign the kind of deal we signed with Visa, we do not
anticipate any other major credit card company to come and get
involved with us,'' Richardson said.
</P>
<P>
   More arts support
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta's smaller arts and cultural groups need more financial
support, according to leaders of the Arts &AMP; Business Council.
</P>
<P>
   The council held its annual lunch Wednesday for the Metropolitan
Atlanta Arts Fund to announce the 1998 winners of its grants to
help financially strapped cultural organizations with budgets of
less than $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   The fund was able to give a total of $180,000 in five separate
grants _ the most it has been able to give in its six-year history.
The organization's initial $3 million endowment has grown to nearly
$4 million because of the rise in the stock market in the past few
years, allowing it to increase grants.
</P>
<P>
   But that's not enough, according to Lynda Courts, chair of the
Arts &AMP; Business Council for the Metro Atlanta Chamber of Commerce.
The fund received requests totaling $1 million from cultural
organizations, according to its chairman Grant Wilmer, an attorney
with Arnall, Golden &AMP; Gregory.
</P>
<P>
   Courts said the Arts &AMP; Business Council, working with the
Atlanta chamber, will decide later this year on a campaign goal,
which she said could double or triple the size of the arts fund.

CLONING PIONEER IS FOCUSED AND CREATIVE IN HIS RESEARCH 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Hawaii, Mass., Japan)   (bl)  
 By GINA KOLATA   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   He is nearly 70, an age when many have retired. He works on the
windowless second floor of a converted warehouse in Honolulu, shut
off from the island paradise. And he can hardly tear himself away.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Ryuzo Yanagimachi, the University of Hawaii researcher whose
cloning of adult mice has amazed fellow biologists, describes
himself as a man devoted to one passion _ pushing the boundaries of
reproductive biology. He surrounds himself with acolytes, often
outstanding postdoctoral students from other countries, like Dr.
Teruhiko Wakayama of Japan, who designed the critical experiment
resulting in the first mouse clone. ``Many Americans are interested
in easy jobs,'' Yanagimachi explains.
</P>
<P>
   His followers adore the experience. ``We are working in an
intense research environment,'' said Dr. Anthony Perry, a
postdoctoral student from England. ``It is a wonderful atmosphere,
extremely conducive to pursuing your curiosity.''
</P>
<P>
   Yanagimachi has little in his life to distract him from his
abiding love of science, and of doing the most improbable
experiments. His wife, Hiroko, was trained as a child psychologist
in Japan, but she could not find work in her field in the United
States because of the language barrier, Yanagimachi said. So he
taught her electron microscopy, and she joined him in his lab.
</P>
<P>
   The couple, who have no children, live just two miles from the
lab, where long hours and seven-day work weeks are the norm.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can leave at 10 at night on a Saturday night, and you'd be
the first to leave,'' Perry said.
</P>
<P>
   Colleagues said it was that singleminded devotion, coupled with
unusual creativity, that animated Yanagimachi's work. ``He's a bit
of a legend, actually,'' said Dr. R. Michael Roberts, an expert in
early bovine embryos at the University of Missouri. ``He does
outlandish experiments that nobody thinks will work and somehow
gets them to work.''
</P>
<P>
   The cloning work was typical. Yanagimachi and Wakayama took on
the challenge just after scientists in Scotland announced last year
that they had produced Dolly the sheep, the first animal to be
cloned from an adult. While some questioned whether Dolly was
really a clone _ she was the only animal produced out of 400 tries
_ others said that even if cloning could succeed, it would be very
cumbersome and inefficient.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, many said, mice, for reasons peculiar to their
biology, would be impossible to clone. But Wakayama and Yanagimachi
quietly went ahead, devising a new cloning method that was found to
be reliable and comparatively efficient, and churning out more than
50 mouse clones.
</P>
<P>
   The method was built on Yanagimachi's work on fertilization. A
few years ago, he discovered that he could take a mouse sperm cell
and dissect away its tail. Then he could inject the sperm head into
an egg and fertilize it.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly afterward, Wakayama arrived at the lab. He has the
equivalent in mouse embryology of a gardener's green thumbs, Perry
said. ``He is technically brilliant. He can do it all. He is one of
the few who is worthy of a place in Yana's lab,'' Perry added,
referring to Yanagimachi by his nickname.
</P>
<P>
   Following up on the work with mouse sperm heads, Wakayama and
Yanagimachi wondered if they could inject just the sperm nucleus
and a support structure, the perinuclear matrix, and fertilize an
egg. They could.
</P>
<P>
   So the next question was whether they could inject a nucleus
from another type of cell _ an adult cell _ into a mouse egg that
had been emptied of its own DNA and make the egg develop as if it
had been fertilized. In other words, could they clone?
</P>
<P>
   Yanagimachi never applied for research funds to clone, but that
was no detriment. Supported by a modest grant from the National
Institutes of Health, Yanagimachi followed advice given him by a
mentor more than 30 years ago: take the grant money and spend three
days a week doing the research you said you would do. Then spend
the other two days doing ``anything you want,'' Yanagimachi
explained.
</P>
<P>
   The adult cell that the scientists started with was already
fully developed. It was a cumulus cell, a glistening spherical cell
that surrounds an egg and nourishes it. Like other specialized
adult cells, virtually all of its genes were turned off -- all it
knew how to do was be a cumulus cell. Yet, somehow, when that cell
was put into an egg, the egg rejuvenated the cumulus cell's DNA,
enabling it to direct the development of an entire mouse. Now,
Yanagimachi and Wakayama have made more than 50 clones, including
clones of clones.
</P>
<P>
   Some say the new work, published Thursday in Nature, helps open
the door for the eventual cloning of human beings. Yanagimachi
politely but firmly declined to discuss that aspect of his work.
</P>
<P>
   ``If all the humans on the face of the earth were infertile,
this may be justified,'' Yanagimachi said. ``But until then, we
should stick to reproduction the way that Mother Nature did it for
us.''
</P>
<P>
   Yanagimachi is nothing if not determined. Born Aug. 29, 1928, he
knew what he wanted to do from his earliest years as a student of
zoology at Hokkaido University in Sapproro Japan: research in
fertilization and embryo biology. But after receiving a doctorate
in animal embryology in 1960, Yanagimachi found himself shut out of
science.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Japan in those days, you could not find a job yourself,''
he said. Professors determined who could become a researcher, and
where they could work, he explained. Although most of Yanagimachi's
friends got jobs as scientists, the only job he could get was as a
high school teacher. He stuck it out for two years, rushing to the
university labs in his spare time to study fish. But, he said,
``many in Japan study fish.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   He decided he wanted to study mammals. So he wrote to an
American scientist, M.C. Chang of the Worcester Foundation for
Experimental Biology in Shrewsbury, Mass., asking him if he could
come as a postdoctoral student. ``He said, `send references.' So I
sent five or six fish papers,'' Yanagimachi said.
</P>
<P>
   To Yanagimachi's surprise, he got the position. And there
Yanagimachi made his first major discovery -- a way to fertilize
hamster eggs in the laboratory. That work directly paved the way
for human in vitro fertilization, said Dr. Barry Bavister, a
professor of animal health and biomedical science at the University
of Wisconsin. It provided the method that finally allowed scientist
to fertilize human eggs in the lab in 1969. ``It was certainly a
technological breakthrough, but it also was a conceptual one,''
Bavister said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1966, Yanagimachi's postdoctoral fellowship ended, and he
returned to Japan. This time, he got a temporary lectureship at
Hokkaido University and was told that he might be able to get an
assistant professorship there. However, he recalled, ``another
candidate appeared, and he got the job.''
</P>
<P>
   He ended up at the University of Hawaii, where he has remained,
happily working in the same converted warehouse where he began 30
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's an amazing guy, a powerhouse, a dynamo,'' Bavister said.
``There is almost no discovery in gamete biology that cannot be
traced back to Yana's ideas,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   In Japan, said Wakayama, Yanagimachi ``is the most famous
scientific star.'' Two years ago, Yanagimachi received Japan's
greatest scientific prize, the International Prize of Biology,
awarded by the emperor. ``This guy, who couldn't get a job in
Japan, ended up with the Japan's most prestigious honor,'' said Dr.
David Epel, a professor of biology at Stanford University's Hopkins
Marine Station in Pacific Grove, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   ``America saved me,'' Yanagimachi said.
</P>
<P>
   Yanagimachi's cloning work has attracted the interest of a
venture capitalist, Laith Reynolds of ProBio America, who is
setting up a consortium of companies and scientists to clone
animals. So now Yanagimachi has a chance to change direction and
devote his life to cloning and its commercial applications. He
thinks not.
</P>
<P>
   ``I stay in basic science,'' Yanagimachi said.

SENATE OKS DELAY IN NEW VISA CARD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF BARKER  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON - WASHINGTON _ The Senate agreed Thursday to delay
for five years a new, fraud-resistant visa card that Arizonans fear
would stifle trade by making it too costly for Mexican shoppers to
cross the border.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate measure, if endorsed by the House, would halt ongoing
plans to replace current border-entry cards, which were issued
free, with new visas that include an individual's photograph,
fingerprint and biographical data.
</P>
<P>
   The new visas cost $45 per person _ too much for many Mexican
families to afford.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona border communities and Gov. Jane Hull believe the
state-of-the-art visas, which are designed to discourage
counterfeiting, would have the unintended effect of restraining
trade as well.
</P>
<P>
   About a half-million current border cards would have to be
replaced in the Nogales area alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no objections to revamping the (border entry) system,
but it's the charge that I object to,'' said Nogales, Ariz., Mayor
Cesar Rios. ``Our economy is very much dependent on trade with
people from Mexico. Nogales has no property tax, so we're very much
dependent on the sales tax.''
</P>
<P>
   Ray Borane, mayor of Douglas, Ariz., said delaying the program
until 2003 would allow opponents time to try to kill the $45 card
altogether. He said his city relies on Mexican shoppers for 40
percent of retail revenues.
</P>
<P>
   ``If people have enough time to realize the impact this will
have, then hopefully something will happen in the interim and more
adjustments can be made,'' Borane said. ``It gives us an
opportunity to be a little more vocal.''
</P>
<P>
   The five-year delay was pushed by Sen. Jon Kyl, R-Ariz. He
successfully inserted the measure into an appropriations bill that
cleared the Senate on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Kyl's measure would waive the $45 fee for children under 15 who
apply with a visa-holding parent. That is a significant exemption
because Mexicans of the same family often cross the border
together.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department has already begun the transition to the new
cards. Under Kyl's plan, the department would be required to
continue processing existing border-crossing documents in a number
of Mexican cities, including the Sonora state cities of Nogales and

</P>
<P>
   Rep. Jim Kolbe, R-Ariz., is pursuing a measure similar to Kyl's
in the House, which has not taken final action.
</P>
<P>
   Until 1978, the Immigration and Naturalization Service issued
border crossing cards with no expiration date. As a result, many
Mexicans are using badly outdated cards, putting INS officials at a
disadvantage when deciding whether to admit a card carrier into the
United States. &QL;

FAA PROPOSES MORE INSPECTIONS OF 747 FUEL TANKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JAMES WALLACE  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ The Federal Aviation Administration Thursday proposed
measures that it said could reduce potential ignition sources in
the center fuel tanks of Boeing 747s.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed airworthiness directive is another in a series of
safety actions involving the jumbo jet's fuel system that have been
made in response to the crash of TWA Flight 800 two years ago. The
center fuel tank of the jumbo jet exploded for reasons still
undetermined.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, The Boeing Co. recommended in several service
bulletins to airlines that they take similar steps to those now
being proposed by the FAA. If adopted after a 45-day public comment
period, the federal agency's proposed airworthiness would make
action mandatory.
</P>
<P>
   It would would require the inspection of center fuel tanks for
damage and to make sure components such as the fuel monitoring
system inside the tanks are properly wired and that the wiring is
not worn or corroded.
</P>
<P>
   In certain 747s, operators would have to install so-called
``flame arrestors'' in the inlet lines of the center fuel tank
scavenge pump, which removes leftover fuel from the tank when it is
nearly empty. The flame arrestor would help prevent an outside
spark or flame from igniting fuel vapors in the tank.
</P>
<P>
   To further reduce wire corrison and lessen the danger that a
spark could be an ignition source inside the tank, silver-plated
wiring in the fuel quantity indicator system would have to be
replaced with nickel-plated wiring on some planes.
</P>
<P>
   Under the proposed directive, replacement of the fuel quantity
indicator system components and wiring would have to be done over
the next two years, or within 20 years from the date the plane was
built, whichever is later.
</P>
<P>
   All other actions proposed by the FAA Thursday would have to be
done within 24 months. Operators would have to report the results
to Boeing within 10 days.
</P>
<P>
   Some 251 U.S.-registered 747s would require one or more of the
actions described in its proposed airworthiness directive, the FAA
said. Costs for the work, the agency said, would vary from $28,000
to $63,000. Those costs are usually borne by the airplane owner.
</P>
<P>
   The FAA said this was the sixth fuel tank action it had either
taken or proposed for Boeing 747, 737 and 767 aircraft since the
TWA crash.
</P>
<P>
   Flight 800 crashed into the Atlantic Ocean just minutes out of
New York's John F. Kennedy airport on July 17, 1996, killing all
230 people on board.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators for the National Transportation Safety Board have
been trying for months to identify the electrical ignition source
that caused the center fuel tank to blow up.
</P>
<P>
   While examining the fuel system wiring in the wreckage, as well
as three retired Boeing 747s and one still in service,
investigators found damaged wires on some early-model fuel probes.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators have been focusing on a theory that a combination
of events involving damaged wires and corrosion on a fuel-measuring
rod could have introduced a spark or flame into the center fuel
tank. The center fuel tank was virtually empty and the vapors in it
heated up as the plane sat on the runway on a hot day waiting to
take off.

RJR NABISCO REPORTS BIG 2ND-QUARTER LOSS 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By CONSTANCE L. HAYS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ RJR Nabisco Holdings Corp. reported a $130 million
second-quarter loss Thursday from the effects of the strong dollar
on overseas cigarette sales, weakness in the company's food
business and tobacco-litigation settlement costs.
</P>
<P>
   The results amounted to a loss of 44 cents a diluted share,
compared with earnings of $243 million, or 71 cents a diluted share
in the second quarter of 1997. Revenue was marginally higher at
$4.292 billion, compared with $4.286 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts had been warned by the company over the last few weeks
about weaker results, but were nonetheless dismayed by the picture
the report painted of the company.
</P>
<P>
   Excluding the one-time effects of a $219 million charge to
reflect revamping of the cookie-cracker business, and a $97 million
tobacco settlement charge, earnings totaled $186 million, or 54
cents a share, down 24 percent from a year earlier. The average
forecast was for 55 cents, according to First Call Corp., which
tracks earnings estimates.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest problem is ongoing weakness in the premium
brands,'' said Martin Feldman, a tobacco analyst for Salomon
Brothers, explaining what happened to international cigarette
sales. ``In Russia, volumes fell 70 percent, and in Japan, they
fell 20 percent. Globally it's hard to know the exact number, but
perhaps by 10 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   Feldman partly attributed the decreases to the strong dollar,
which makes sales abroad smaller when converted back to dollars
from the local currency. But he also noted that RJR's brands, like
Camel and Winston, are up against fierce competition, including
Marlboro cigarettes, a brand owned by Philip Morris.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless there's some major depreciation in the value of the
dollar, I don't see any recovery this year in the international
tobacco business,'' Feldman said.
</P>
<P>
   Domestic net sales of cigarettes rose 15 percent in the quarter
despite a volume decline of 3 percent. The decline has been
generally the same across the industry.
</P>
<P>
   The domestic sales increase reflected increased prices and sales
for the Winston and Doral brands. The development was applauded by
RJR's chief executive, Steven F. Goldstone, in a company statement.
``We are pleased with the performance of domestic tobacco company,
whose operating results were in line with expectations and industry
trends,'' he said. ``Reynolds continues to make meaningful progress
revitalizing its core brands with imaginative, intelligent
marketplace programs and a continued focus on cost management. We
continue to beleive the company will be best served by a more
predictable political and legal environment and we are committed to
doing our part to bring about such a result.''
</P>
<P>
   Apart from tobacco, the company revealed more grim results in
its biscuit division, which includes venerable brands like Ritz
crackers, Wheat Thins and Oreo cookies. That division announced
results on Wednesday, and the numbers showed net income fell 29
percent for the quarter, from $102 million in 1997 to $72 million.
</P>
<P>
   Sales were down from $907 million last year to $864 million this
year in the biscuit division, and down in the international and
domestic food divisions overall from $2.191 billion to $2.131
billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who would have ever thought you'd see the biscuit earnings
down 30 percent?'' said Emanuel Goldman, an analyst with Paine
Webber in San Francisco. ``Even A-1 steak sauce and some other
things were off 2.5 percent. That's something they're not happy
about.''
</P>
<P>
   Goldman and other analysts blamed earlier management decisions
for the situation. Nabisco's chief executive, James Kilts, joined
the company late last year and has begun an ambitious program to
improve the sales force, revitalize lagging brands and rid Nabisco
of certain nonessential assets.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, the company announced the sale of its
margarine and spread business to ConAgra; Kilts, while at Philip
Morris' Kraft division, had sold the same business to Nabisco. But
even the sale will cost the company several cents in earnings,
according to company management, since the price was not high
enough to be recorded as a net gain.
</P>
<P>
   Chief among the biscuit nonperformers, the company said, was the
Snackwell's brand, as well as breakfast snacks. The company also
said higher costs related to selling depressed earnings in the
biscuit unit.

 &HT;    Massey throws towel; Democrat in runoff gives nod to Barnes
 &HT;    By Charles Walston
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- The race for the Democratic nomination for governor
ended Thursday much as it began almost a year ago: with a bombshell
announcement that a candidate was bowing out.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Lewis Massey suspended his campaign and
endorsed state Rep. Roy Barnes (D-Mableton) as the party's nominee,
avoiding a potentially bloody runoff that Massey probably could not
have won.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes fell only 8,671 votes short of winning a majority in
Tuesday's primary, finishing with more than 49 percent of the vote.
Massey polled about 28 percent, and although he forced Barnes into
a runoff, the runner-up faced a steep uphill climb against a
better-financed opponent.
</P>
<P>
   As late as Wednesday afternoon, Massey was vowing to wage an
aggressive runoff. But after talking to his supporters, his wife,
Amy, and his parents, Massey decided that such a scenario would
help nobody except Guy Millner, the Republican nominee.
</P>
<P>
   Virgil Williams, Massey's campaign chairman and chief
fund-raiser, said he had ``laid out the landscape'' for the
candidate and told Massey his supporters would not be disappointed
if he didn't want to stay in the race.
</P>
<P>
   By late Wednesday night, Massey was telling people in his
campaign he had decided to pull out. Early Thursday morning, he
called Barnes and Gov. Zell Miller to inform them of his decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not a quitter, and I wanted to fight,'' Massey said at a
news conference in Miller's office, where he was joined by the
governor, Barnes and other party leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``But after a day on the campaign trail, I knew that to continue
to fight would not be in the best interest of the Massey family or
the state of Georgia.''
</P>
<P>
   While Massey will no longer actively campaign, his name will
still appear on the Aug. 11 runoff ballot. An official withdrawal
from the race would have thrown the third-place finisher, David
Poythress, into a runoff with Barnes.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes and Massey both entered the governor's race last August
after Lt. Gov. Pierre Howard said he would not run because of
family considerations.
</P>
<P>
   Howard, who is Massey's political mentor, had been widely
considered the favorite for the Democratic nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Howard and Miller both said Massey had not sought their advice
before making his decision, but both praised him for it.
</P>
<P>
   ``What Lewis Massey does here today shows great judgment and
great character, putting his political ambition aside for the
people of this state,'' said Miller.
</P>
<P>
   Massey's decision to step aside allows Barnes to conserve
campaign funds he will need in the general election battle against
Millner, who already has pumped about $3 million of his personal
wealth into his own campaign this year. Barnes probably would have
spent more than $1 million in a runoff marked by combative campaign
ads; now, he will probably spend about $500,000 on positive ads.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes also is spared the attacks on his record that a runoff
opponent presumably would have leveled _ assuming that Massey could
have raised TV ad money for his struggling campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps most important, the Democratic Party will not be split
by a bitter feud just three months before the general election.
Republicans, on the other hand, face the prospect of a recount of
primary votes, which former attorney general Mike Bowers requested
Thursday in a last-ditch effort to prevent Millner from claiming
the GOP nomination outright.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes said the lack of a contested runoff will be ``very
helpful'' to his prospects in the general election. ``This is one
of my better days,'' he said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   State Republican Party Chairman Rusty Paul admitted that a
Democratic runoff battle ``would have been good for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Millner hinted that since Barnes has effectively clinched the
Democratic nomination, Millner might soon begin his own attack on
the veteran state lawmaker.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having a longer general election gives us more of an
opportunity to let voters know his record,'' Millner said.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Massey gains several things by getting out of the
race.
</P>
<P>
   First, he no longer must try to raise money for a campaign that
ran a distant second in the primary, or face the option of spending
his own money on a lost cause.
</P>
<P>
   He also will not have to see himself savaged in negative ads,
which the Barnes camp was prepared to start running as early as
this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, if Barnes had emerged from a runoff only to lose in
November, many Democrats might have blamed Massey. As it is, Massey
can gain the good will of Barnes supporters around the state, many
of whom are wealthy and powerful.
</P>
<P>
   No matter whether Massey chooses to run for office again or goes
into private business when his term as secretary of state expires
next year, he will be better off without all the political enemies
he might have made.
</P>
<P>
   Massey pledged to campaign for Barnes in the fall, and said his
support was unconditional. Barnes also said no deal had been struck
between the two men.
</P>
<P>
   Massey said he had made only one promise in the last two days,
and it had nothing to do with politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``I promised my little boy and girl I'd take them to the pool
tomorrow,'' he said.

WHITE HOUSE SAYS VETO OF HOUSE `PATIENT PROTECTION' BILL IS
LIKELY 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By ROBERT PEAR    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The White House said Thursday night that President
Clinton would probably veto the version of ``patient protection''
legislation that Republican leaders plan to take up in the House of
Representatives on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton described himself as a champion of patients' rights. But
in a formal evaluation of the House Republican bill, the White
House said, ``It covers too few people, it provides too few patient
protections, and it contains unnecessary and irrelevant provisions
that undermine the chances for a bipartisan agreement on a
patients' bill of rights.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House said it ``strongly opposes'' the House
Republican bill as now drafted. Accordingly, it said, ``the
president's senior advisers would recommend that he veto this
bill'' if Congress sent him the measure in its current form.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Clinton said he wanted to work with Republicans to
establish strong, enforceable protections for patients this year.
</P>
<P>
   While the leadership bill is likely to pass in the House,
compromises would probably be needed in the Senate before any bill
could get enough support to overcome a filibuster.
</P>
<P>
   The effort to define patients' rights and set standards for
health maintenance organizations has emerged as a big issue in many
elections this year. After initially resisting the clamor for
legislation, Republican leaders recently offered their own
proposals as an alternative to the Democratic bill.
</P>
<P>
   Speaker Newt Gingrich is the chief sponsor of the bill scheduled
for House debate on Friday. He introduced the bill on July 16 and
is taking it directly to the floor, bypassing committees.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Republican leaders plan to take up their version of the
legislation later this month. Administration officials and consumer
advocates say it is weaker than the House Republican bill and
covers many fewer people.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican and Democratic proposals are superficially
similar. They would guarantee coverage of emergency medical care in
certain circumstances, assure open communication between doctors
and patients and allow women in HMOs to go directly to
obstetricians and gynecologists without getting prior approval. But
a close reading of the bills shows that they differ in ways that
could have significant practical effects for patients.
</P>
<P>
   In its formal statement of administration policy, the White
House said that Gingrich's bill ``does not apply to the individual
insurance market, and therefore millions of Americans would not be
assured these patient protections.''
</P>
<P>
   Most provisions of the House Republican bill would apply to all
employer-sponsored health plans, covering perhaps 145 million
people. By contrast, the main provisions of the Senate Republican
bill would apply to 48 million people in self-insured group plans
that are now exempt from state regulation.
</P>
<P>
   The White House said that the House Republican bill did not
guarantee access to medical specialists for people with cancer,
heart disease and other serious or chronic illnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, it said, the bill does not prevent HMOs from giving
doctors financial incentives to limit care, and it does not
guarantee ``continuity of care'' for patients whose doctors are
dropped from an HMO.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the White House said, the House Republican bill
would provide ``little or no recourse to patients who are injured''
because of a health plan's actions. The proposed fines of $250 a
day are ``wholly insufficient,'' it said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   House Republicans would allow patients to appeal certain
decisions by HMOs to an independent panel of medical experts. But
the administration said HMOs could develop their own definitions of
``medical necessity,'' so it would be difficult for patients to
prevail.
</P>
<P>
   The White House criticized three provisions of the House
Republican bill as ``poison pills.'' One would limit damage awards
for pain and suffering in lawsuits by patients injured as a result
of medical malpractice. Another would allow much wider use of
medical savings accounts. The third would allow small businesses to
band together and buy insurance exempt from most forms of state
regulation.
</P>
<P>
   The administration said the proposed tax break for medical
savings accounts would benefit ``the healthiest and wealthiest
individuals'' and might remove them from the general insurance
market, so premiums would rise for other people.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, it said, the proposal to create purchasing pools for
small businesses would let them ``discriminate by cherry-picking
healthier groups and individuals.'' &QL;

FURILLO HASN'T LOST TOUCH WITH L.A.
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TOM HOFFARTH  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALM SPRINGS, Calif. _ It's a month before his 73rd birthday _
``you could've got odds of 1,000 to 1 on that happening,'' he
admits _ so of course Bud Furillo has considered retiring.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was going to hang it up last May,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And this city would be about as good a place to do it as any.
</P>
<P>
   But then Furillo wakes up at his home in nearby Palm Desert,
reads the sports sections in his den with his dog, Rip, and the
enthusiasm that propelled him through more than a half-century of a
career in sports journalism starts all over again.
</P>
<P>
   He simply can't wait to drive over to the radio studios of KPSI,
920 on the AM dial, and start prepping for his weekday, 4 to 6 p.m.
sports-talk show.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the highlight of my day,'' said Furillo, who's been doing
his show in Palm Springs for four years, with the last 5{ months at
KPSI.
</P>
<P>
   He then qualifies his statement: ``It's the best thing I do all
day.''
</P>
<P>
   From Furillo, you won't get any smack talk, no blathering on
about what's wrong with sports today from the mouth of someone
who's been there and done that. Just as he did in his 10 years as
the ``SportsTalk'' host of KABC's popular show in the '70s and
'80s, Furillo keeps his ``Steam Room'' show more on the lighter
side.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's too much negativity in today's media anyway,'' said
Furillo, who started as a sportswriter in 1945 and considers
himself to this day as a newspaper man. ``Nothing positive comes
from negative thinking. And people still like to read nice things
about people.''
</P>
<P>
   With 39-year-old producer/co-host Steve Kelly to bounce off of,
Furillo pulls it off. But it doesn't mean Furillo ignores current
affairs.
</P>
<P>
   On his shows this past week, in fact, the Dodgers have been a
topic almost as hot as the weather.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, Furillo interviewed former Dodgers general manager Fred
Claire, who said he was asked about firing then-manager Bill
Russell by team president Bob Graziano right after the blockbuster
deal with the Florida Marlins. Claire said he thought it was better
to let things settle down and then talk about it around the
All-Star break. Soon enough, Russell and Claire were fired.
</P>
<P>
   Claire also admitted he didn't consider a trade for Cincinnati
reliever Jeff Shaw specifically because of his multi-year contract
that allows him to demand a trade. Claire said that's what happened
several years ago when he obtained Jesse Orosco from the New York
Mets.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, current GM-in-training Tom Lasorda came on, and Furillo
asked him about his relationship with Russell. Lasorda admitted
he's upset because Russell never thanked him for recommending him
for the manager's job when Lasorda stepped down in the middle of
the '96 season.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, Graziano was Furillo's guest. Graziano admitted that
the team had seriously considered firing Russell last season.
</P>
<P>
   Hear any of that kind of stuff on L.A. sports talk shows?
</P>
<P>
   Even in Palm Springs, L.A. sports are the talk of the town.
</P>
<P>
   ``This city is full of former L.A. residents who want to keep up
on what's going on,'' said Furillo, who, when let go from KABC in
'87 because of ratings, went to work in Sacramento, where he'd be
closer to his ailing mother.
</P>
<P>
   Although Furillo returns to L.A. occasionally _ he'll be in
Anaheim next week to see the Yankees, and has plans to attend USC's
football opener against Purdue in August _ his health prevents him
from making more visits.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know me _ nobody loved L.A. more than I did when I was
there,'' said the legendary bombastic sports editor of the former
Los Angeles Herald Examiner from 1967 to '78.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I think it's a tragedy that no one seems to care about the
history of L.A. sports anymore. I find it offensive that no one
seems to have a sense of that city.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no `now' without a `then,' and nobody knows that
anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   But as long as Furillo has a voice _ even if it's in Palm
Springs, where on a good night the signal from the 5,000-watt
station gets all the way down to Rialto _ he'll make sure no one
forgets.

 ADVERTISING: AT&AMP;T AD FILMED IN VIETNAM WAS A LONG TIME COMING 
</HEADLINE>
  (af) 
 By STUART ELLIOTT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A television commercial begins with a man in his 20s
riding in a boat on a river. He disembarks, asks directions,
reaches the top of a mountain and pensively looks around. ``My dad
was here,'' he says. ``He never talked about it much. He said we
had to be there. Here I am.''
</P>
<P>
   The man is subsequently seen on a telephone, using a card to
call his father. ``Ty, you still in Singapore?'' the father asks.
The man replies: ``No, I'm on leave. I'm in Vietnam.''
</P>
<P>
   There is a long pause. ``Vietnam?'' the father asks. The son
answers, ``Yeah.'' The father quietly says, ``Let's talk, son,'' to
which the son, choking up, responds, ``Yeah.''
</P>
<P>
   That commercial, which began appearing just before Father's Day,
seems innocuous enough; after all, there is no combat footage or
archival film of antiwar protests. Yet viewers did not see the spot
until more than a year after it was filmed on location in Vietnam
by Young &AMP; Rubicam Advertising in New York, as part of a continuing
image campaign for the AT&AMP;T Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Why was the spot shelved for so long? AT&AMP;T advertising and
marketing executives feared that it would evoke some of the
contentious, polarized feelings generated by the very war the
commercial is about. Only after an unusual lobbying effort by the
top-name talents who helped create the commercial _ which included
screening the spot for Vietnam veterans _ did the AT&AMP;T executives
relent.
</P>
<P>
   Those joining forces to fight for the commercial had been on
opposite sides during the Vietnam War. One was David Crosby, who
sings ``Long Time Gone'' in the background. Another was Edward H.
Vick, the chairman and chief executive of Y&AMP;R Advertising. He was
on hand to watch the spot being filmed in the Mekong Delta region
of Vietnam, where he won medals for his wartime service as a naval
officer.
</P>
<P>
   Also battling to save the spot was its director, Joe Pytka, who
has worked for advertisers like Nike and Pepsi-Cola in addition to
AT&AMP;T. He described his feelings about Vietnam as ``strong and
mixed'' _ encapsulating the views of many Americans who had been in
the muddled middle over the war.
</P>
<P>
   The war over a commercial about a war is indicative of a problem
facing mainstream marketers as they seek new and novel ways to
capture the attention of increasingly fickle consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Emotional advertising intended to stir feelings is often
inherently more appealing than advertising focused on product
benefits and features. But there can be danger lurking in such
campaigns: Ads that stir buzz, causing people to pay attention, can
also stir controversy, causing people to make complaints.
</P>
<P>
   ``With a spot like that, you worry,'' said Stephen D. Graham,
vice president for worldwide marketing communication at AT&AMP;T in
Basking Ridge, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to create advertising that is highly relevant,'' he
added, ``demonstrating the importance of communication and its
importance to people who are important to each other. But you want
to make sure you're treating the subject in a respectful way, and
there's always risk involved.''
</P>
<P>
   Vick said that he understood his client's concerns about the
commercial, which also went through routine consumer research and
testing.
</P>
<P>
   ``AT&AMP;T was being really sensitive to whether this would alienate
anyone,'' Vick said, adding that executives were worried ``that all
the Vietnam veterans would cancel their cards and all the antiwar
people would cancel their cards.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a question of whether Vietnam is still too sensitive a
subject,'' Vick said. ``Our feeling was the fact that it is still a
sensitive subject set it up to be a powerful piece of
communication.''
</P>
<P>
   Crosby, who had been an antiwar activist during the Vietnam era,
agreed with Vick about the commercial's visceral appeal.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was inspired and I liked it tremendously,''
Crosby said. So when he heard about the decision to shelve the
spot, he added, ``I wrote AT&AMP;T a long letter saying, `I understand
you're nervous, but it's the best thing you could associate
yourselves with and you should have the courage to do it.'
</P>
<P>
   ``The commercial isn't really about the war for me,'' Crosby
said, ``it's about bridging father and son, two generations, two
countries, the two sides in this country.
</P>
<P>
   ``The commercial is about communication,'' he added, ``and most
of the ills of humanity, like war, result from a breakdown in
communication.''
</P>
<P>
   The commercial is the first ``I've actually let my music be used
for,'' said Crosby, who wrote ``Long Time Gone'' and re-created the
original version for the commercial. The song heard in the spot is
sung by Crosby and Graham Nash; the original was sung by Crosby,
Nash and Stephen Stills.
</P>
<P>
   Pytka called Crosby's letter ``touching'' and said he welcomed
it because ``I'd given up on the commercial; I never thought it
would see the light of day.''
</P>
<P>
   The commercial is less about the war, Pytka said, than about
``this incredibly strong father with his secrets and this son, who
are probably now going to connect as adults, as men, for the first
time.''
</P>
<P>
   As part of the attempts to rescue the commercial, Vick enlisted
the help of the Vietnam Veterans of America in Washington, which
screened the spot last year for members of its executive committee,
board and staff. In a letter to Vick, George Duggins, national
president of the organization, wrote that they found the spot
``memorable.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Most likely, folks' thoughts would be somewhat private,''
Duggins wrote, ``but they will most likely remember the ad.''
</P>
<P>
   After the commercial finally began appearing last month, it
returned for the Fourth of July weekend.
</P>
<P>
   The reaction so far? ``We had a lot of positive responses,''
Graham of AT&AMP;T said, adding that plans called for the spot to come
back for appropriate occasions like Veterans Day and Memorial Day.
It may also be shown during so-called event programming that AT&AMP;T
sponsors such as broadcasts of the Academy Awards.
</P>
<P>
   There were concerns expressed by some consumers that the
commercial would be perceived not as prowar or antiwar but as
exploiting war to sell long-distance service or burnish a corporate
image. That happened last year in Canada, when Bell Canada ran a
commercial by the Leo Burnett Co. Ltd. agency in Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   The spot showed a grandson placing a thank-you call to his
grandfather from Dieppe, scene of an ill-fated raid during World
War II; it drew widespread praise but also some complaints about
commercialization.
</P>
<P>
   Of his agency's AT&AMP;T spot, Vick said: ``The subject was used in
an appropriate way. It would be different if it were guys going
back to drink Budweiser.''
</P>
<P>
   Graham of AT&AMP;T echoed Vick, saying that the commercial was
``very respectful and reverent to the relationship between the
father and son and to the subject.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a great deal of respect for those who fought for this
spot,'' he added. ``I was the person who was the most cautious
about this to make sure it was absolutely right. And I think we
accomplished that.''

 By ANDREW POLLACK   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ A turtle icon suddenly lit up on the dashboard of
my Toyota RAV4 Electric Vehicle. The car's batteries were
exhausted, and I had entered ``limp home mode,'' which would allow
me to putter along at a reduced speed for a few miles to make it
back to a charger.
</P>
<P>
   But instead of slowing down, the car stalled completely on a
dark street a mile from my home. Panicked, I jumped out, pushed the
car to the side of the road and began scrounging for coins to call
a tow truck.
</P>
<P>
   But after turning the car off for a few minutes and then
restarting it, the RAV4-EV moved again, though only for another
block before stalling again. It took about 15 minutes of starting
and stopping, including a heart-pounding dash across busy Wilshire
Boulevard, to make it back to my garage.
</P>
<P>
   Running out of charge is the worst nightmare for an electric car
driver. There are few places for recharging, and it is not possible
to walk to a service station and buy a can of charge to get you
moving again. In this case, however, I had ignored low-battery
warnings for 20 miles and deliberately run down the batteries _
part of my road tests of three electric vehicles, in an effort to
assess their everyday practicality.
</P>
<P>
   Southern California is the nation's test-bed for electric
vehicles. Spurred by a state rule that will require 10 percent of
the vehicles sold in the state to be emission-free starting in
2003, manufacturers have introduced several electric models. And a
network of public charging stations, which would be the gas
stations of the electric age, is beginning to sprout.
</P>
<P>
   I spent four weeks using electric vehicles for all of my
driving, with a few exceptions for distances beyond the cars'
range. In addition to the Toyota, I sampled the General Motors EV1
and the Honda EV Plus.
</P>
<P>
   So far, few of these cars have been leased. (Manufacturers,
worried about the batteries' longevity, are generally offering the
cars for lease rather than purchase.)
</P>
<P>
   GM, the first to market in December 1996, had leased just 430
through the end of June. Honda, which is making its EV available in
New York this month, has leased 177 in Southern California since
the car's debut in May 1997. Toyota, having decided that EVs are
not suited for general consumers, is leasing the car only to
fleets, but on a nationwide basis. Since November it has received
orders for 365.
</P>
<P>
   Besides a limited driving range that makes it difficult to visit
distant suburbs, the cars are expensive. The electric RAV4, for
instance, leases for $457 or sells for $42,000. It has a top speed
of 78 miles an hour and can travel about 100 miles on a charge. The
conventional, gasoline-powered RAV4, which sells for about $25,000,
can go more than four times that far on a tank of gasoline, and at
much higher speeds.
</P>
<P>
   The GM car leases for $399 a month for three years, a steep
price for a two-seater that goes 70 to 90 miles _ at most _ on a
charge. (The price includes towing to a charger should the need
arise.) The Honda EV Plus, a four-seat hatchback that looks like a
small minivan, leases for $455 a month.
</P>
<P>
   On top of that, one needs to have a charger installed. The
construction required for that generally costs $800 or more.
</P>
<P>
   Despite these drawbacks, the electric cars were perfectly
suitable for commuting and moving around town for appointments. And
they offer some advantages. The ride is quiet, and there is
something nice about not having to go to gas stations _ one can
just plug in the car at home for recharging overnight. The power I
used was scarcely noticeable on my monthly electricity bills. I
normally spend $10 to $15 a week on gasoline.
</P>
<P>
   Driving an electric car is similar to using a gasoline-powered
car, but there are differences. Turning on the car requires
flicking a switch rather than igniting a spark and turning over the
engine.
</P>
<P>
   While Honda and Toyota still require drivers to turn a key, this
is largely a nod to tradition. GM has done away with keys
altogether. One unlocks the doors and starts the car by punching a
numeric code onto keypads. In all the cars, the dashboard lights up
_ but, eerily, there is no sound or vibration, making it hard to
believe the car is running.
</P>
<P>
   Driving is quiet, as well, although a high-frequency whine from
the motor rises in pitch during acceleration and falls during
deceleration. Acceleration varies, but the EV1 is particularly
quick.
</P>
<P>
   Although Southern California is the nation's electric-vehicle
capital, most people still have never seen one. I had driven only
half a block in the GM EV1 when the driver behind me pulled
alongside at a red light and asked, ``What kind of car is that?''
For the whole month I found myself being stared at and questioned.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   This is especially true for the EV1, which looks like a
space-age sports car _ like the Honda, it does not share its body
with any other vehicle _ with an unusual tapered rear end. By the
time I got the RAV4-EV, which looks virtually the same as the
regular RAV4, I was pining for some anonymity. But my hopes faded
when I saw that Toyota had painted ``Electric Vehicle'' in big
letters across the sides.
</P>
<P>
   The lack of familiarity resulted in more than stares. Valet
parking attendants, whom one deals with constantly in Los Angeles,
generally did not know how to handle these cars. I usually gave a
quick lecture and hoped the attendant would remember enough to
retrieve the car later. At one restaurant, the attendant listened
to my explanation, got in the Honda and turned the key. After a few
minutes, he said, ``I'm sorry, I can't get it started.''
</P>
<P>
   The car was actually on, but he did not realize it, because of
the lack of any engine rumble. At a hotel, the attendant, after
hearing my explanation, just left the car parked in front.
</P>
<P>
   I had a sense that driving range would be a problem when I got
into my fully charged EV1 for the first time and saw on the
dashboard readout that I had 36 miles left. While GM advertises a
range of 70 to 90 miles, the computer in the car estimates the
actual range based on how the car had been driven recently.
</P>
<P>
   After driving nine miles to work, the range gauge still said 36
miles, some small comfort. But even after a week of conservative
driving, the most I could get the gauge to read on a full charge
was 42 miles.
</P>
<P>
   I was so scared about wasting electricity that I wouldn't turn
on the radio or use the electric windows. The GM car, the first to
market, uses lead-acid batteries, but will get more efficient
nickel-metal-hydride batteries this year.
</P>
<P>
   The Honda EV-Plus and Toyota RAV4-EV already use those
batteries. The Honda can typically go 60 to 80 miles; the Toyota
gave me 103 miles before I entered limp-home mode. Both are
four-seaters with more cargo space than the EV1. In these, I felt
more at ease using the air-conditioner.
</P>
<P>
   But if GM's car lacks range, the company has done more than the
others to allow for recharging away from home, even providing a
portable charger that can be plugged into a household outlet. More
important, it subsidized the construction of 165 charging sites
around Southern California, at places like airports, hotels and
shopping centers. For now, the electricity is free.
</P>
<P>
   I pulled in for a fill-up at a Ralphs supermarket one evening.
Sure enough, just in front of the store, right next to the
blue-striped handicapped parking area, were two choice parking
spots painted green and marked for EVs only.
</P>
<P>
   To my surprise, both spots were full _ but not with EVs. After
all, why waste a good spot? Parking without authorization in a
handicapped spot brings a big fine, but not so for spaces reserved
for EVs. The people using these spots were equally astonished to
see a real electric car show up in need of a battery charge.
</P>
<P>
   When I finally got to the charger, I inserted its paddle into
the slot in the front of the car and was told by an electronic
readout that my batteries were 66 percent full and would require
one hour and 15 minutes to charge fully. So I wandered inside the
store and bought ice cream, cookies and other things I didn't need.
(Now I see why Ralphs installed the chargers.) But after I killed
25 minutes shopping, the charger said another hour would still be
required. I gave up.
</P>
<P>
   Each used a different charging system, which impedes the
development of public charging stations. (Imagine if different
brands of cars needed different gas stations.) Indeed, there is a
Betamax-versus-VHS battle between the inductive charging favored by
GM and Nissan and the conductive charging favored by Honda and
Ford. Toyota, which now uses a conductive system _ one different
from Honda's _ plans to develop an inductive system with GM.
</P>
<P>
   I found all three systems easier to operate than a gasoline
pump, although GM's was most elegant. But it almost doesn't matter
whether a standard is set or not.
</P>
<P>
   The stations will be of little use unless charging can be done
nearly instantly. It now takes three hours or more to fully charge
a nearly depleted EV1, and six hours or more to fill up the Honda
or Toyota.
</P>
<P>
   In summary, electric cars are fine, even fun, for those with a
short commute, a predictable driving pattern, a willingness to be
stared at _ and a gasoline powered car in reserve. Limp-home mode
is a small comfort, but it's not enough to put one's insecurities
completely to rest.

Jordan jersey peeking out from under the large Iranian flag draped

United States have had a little war these last 20 years,'' he says.
Iranians are warm to Americans, but wary of any closer ties to
their government. They closely watch the recent calls by Iranian

   PBP-FIRES-TIMBER _ BUNNELL, Fla. _ With nearly a half million
acres charred in the Memorial Day fires, foresters and timber men
are scrambling to harvest burned wood before it rots. Wood can
usually be salvaged within 45 days. After that, fungus will ruin
it. Next week the state will start harvesting forests in Flalger
County and we'll go along with some of the crews. With so much wood
to chop, it's bound to be a pretty massive undertaking. Mills are
trying to set up additional irrigation systems in their yards
because watered wood will keep twice as long. The Department of
Agriculture is also trying to get weight limits on highways
temporarily lifted so truckers can haul more wood to out-of-state
mills. State says part of the problem is local mills got backed up
because of wood harvested early with the drought. (Staletovich,

   PBP-HMO-DOC _ PORT ST. LUCIE, Fla. _ After a decade as a public
health administrator, Dr. Rod Cardiff was looking forward to
returning to private practice. He found an office on a busy Port
St. Lucie street in 1996, hired a staff, and started building a
family practice. Six months later, he contracted to serve patients
with Humana Inc., the first to offer a Medicare HMO on the Treasure
Coast. Within months, Cardiff's practice had jumped from 170 to 700
patients. Working with a giant HMO saved Cardiff, 50, from
advertising, and he enjoyed treating the mostly elderly population.
But on Jan. 28, Cardiff got a letter saying that all of Humana's
members were being reassigned and that his contract would end in 30
days. Humana spokeswoman Pam Gadensky said Cardiff was terminated
because his practice was not growing fast enough. But Humana told
Cardiff that he was spending too much sending patients to hospitals
and specialists. Without enough patients, Cardiff closed his
practice. He's now looking for another job. ``Medicine has changed
a lot,'' Cardiff said. ``The power HMOs have over doctors is even
greater than I thought.'' Though most Florida physicians work in
HMO networks, Cardiff's experience shows why growing numbers of
doctors are voicing discontent with the health plans. (Galewitz,
Palm Beach Post). 25

   PBP-HMO-COMPLAINTS _ Boca Raton, Fla. _ Helpless, Ron Finger
waited for months as his 16-year-old shrunk to 90 pounds. He was
waiting for his insurance company to approve a psychiatrist for
Tamara as she battled anorexia. But all HIP Health Plan could come
up with were psychiatrists specializing in the elderly. So Finger
violated the biggest rule in managed care: He found his own doctors
and placed Tamara at the Renfrew Center, an inpatient mental
facility with physicians trained to help teens overcome eating
disorders. Now the Boca resident is battling HIP over the $72,000
bill for the 90 days of treatment at the center. The HMO says it
doesn't have to pay because it never authorized the treatment. But
all Finger said he could think about was saving his child. ``At the
end of the day, we had to protect our daughter,'' he says. The
Fingers are not alone in trying to get managed care companies to
pay for unauthorized doctor or hospital visits. Florida's Agency
for Health Care Administration gets about 5,000 complaints a week.

 &HT;    `You know that child could have easily been yours'
 &HT;    By Virginia Anderson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- Tears seemed to fall softly across Georgia Thursday
as news spread of the death of a 2-year-old with E. coli, but they
spilled hard from the parents of other children who were infected
and survived.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just so awful, so horrible,'' said Lisbeth Addison,
mother of Matthew Addison, 3, who was released July 5 from Kosair
Children's Hospital in Louisville, then readmitted and released a
second time July 11. ``That's the first thing I thought about this
morning when I woke up, was what they were waking up to. And, you
know, that child could have easily been yours.''
</P>
<P>
   When Addison and other parents heard that McCall Akin died
Wednesday at Scottish Rite Children's Medical Center, the news
provided at once a terrible reminder of their ordeal and a pang of
guilt that another's child wasn't quite as fortunate as their own.
</P>
<P>
   ``It devastated us,'' said Anne Hilbert of Cherokee County,
whose son, Michael, was hospitalized at Egleston Children's
Hospital for two weeks in mid-June. ``We hated it.''
</P>
<P>
   McCall's parents, Andy and Marisa, released a statement
Thursday. ``We would like to express our deepest gratitude to all
the people who prayed for our daughter, McCall, during her
illness.'' They asked that any donations be sent to Scottish Rite.
</P>
<P>
   While the Hilberts, Addisons and several other families have
been spared the loss of a child, they know some of what the Akins
family endured. They spent similar sleepness nights in a hospital
room next to a child moaning and trying to rip out IV tubes, a
child undergoing blood transfusions, dialysis and related problems
like liver disease. They know the trauma of E. coli.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's important for parents to be aware that this is a
serious pathogen,'' said Randy Addison, a pilot for United Parcel
Service. ``It's a pathogen with a bad attitude. It was a horrific
experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Because the bacteria can cause long-term damage, the experience
might not be over for the children who had serious infections, like
Matthew and Michael who were on dialysis for several days. Some
children infected after eating contaminated hamburger during the
Jack in the Box outbreak in 1993 have needed kidney transplants.
Several became diabetic,and many have learning disabilities caused
by loss of oxygen to the brain.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the scary part,'' Randy Addison said. ``There's always
the potential for kidney failure, we'll have to have his blood
pressure checked, and he has a greater chance of developing
diabetes and gall stones.''
</P>
<P>
   For a parent of a stricken child, the parallels _ and the irony
_ are hard to avoid. The Addisons, like the Akins and families of
other children, moved into the hospital, setting up cots in their
child's room.
</P>
<P>
   Just as McCall Akins' grandmother moved in to be close to her
grandchild, so did Matthew's maternal grandmother. And, just as
there was sad irony in McCall's infection and death because she was
a vegetarian, there was some irony in Matthew's case, too. Lisbeth
Addison had read of the Jack in the Box cases two years ago and had
been concerned ever since, careful not to feed Matthew or his older
sister, Brooke, undercooked hamburgers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always thought Liz was being paranoid about it,'' Randy
Addison said. After watching Matthew fall ill on their way back to
Kentucky after visiting Georgia relatives, Randy's view changed
quickly.
</P>
<P>
   As with the other E. coli cases, Matthew first became ill with
diarrhea, then bloody stools and intense abdominal pain.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was heart-wrenching,'' Lisbeth Addison said of watching her
3-year-old worsen by the hour on their trip home on Sunday, June
21.
</P>
<P>
   Matthew became terrified to go to the bathroom, his mother said,
because the pain was so bad. By Tuesday, doctors admitted him to
the hospital. But that was only the beginning.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't give them any immodium (medicine that typically
stops diarrhea), and you can't give them any pain medicine,'' Randy
Addison said. ``Even with all the specialized care at our hands,
all we could do was sit there and fold our hands and wait for the
infection to take its course.''
</P>
<P>
   The Addisons and Lisbeth's mother took turns on the cots the
hospital provided in Matthew's room, but no one could sleep.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was curled over in the fetal position, screaming,'' Randy
Addison said. Even the nurses sometimes left the room to cry.
</P>
<P>
   For days, Matthew didn't improve. Even though intravenous lines
kept him hydrated internally, he would beg for more water than the
Dixie Cup-sized allowance doctors said he could have every eight
hours. Again, the Addisons could do nothing.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, June 26, doctors decided Matthew needed surgery to
insert a special catheter into his abdominal cavity. That meant no
water after midnight Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had these awful cracked, bleeding lips, and he was pleading
with me for water all night long, and all night long, I kept
putting him off,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday morning, Lisbeth reached her breaking point.
</P>
<P>
   ``Finally, he looked at me and said, `Mommy, I'm dying! I need
water!', and I lost it. I broke down, and I was hysterical.''
</P>
<P>
   Nurses did allow her to soak his lips with a wet washcloth.
</P>
<P>
   After the surgery, Matthew did not begin to improve for several
days. Lisbeth began to focus on bracing herself for the worst.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I was losing him,'' she said quietly.
</P>
<P>
   She reached out to friends who had gathered and asked them to
help strengthen her. ``I can't tell you about the love and
outpouring of support, and what it means,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Fellow pilots at UPS took Randy Addison's shifts for him so he
could continue to be on the payroll but remain at the hospital.
Friends brought home-cooked meals to the hospital. Friends baby-sat
their daughter.
</P>
<P>
   After several days of small improvements, Matthew suffered a
setback. But by the end of the second week, Matthew was looking
strong enough to go home. He had to have a second operation to
remove the catheter, but on Sunday, July 5, he was home.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was so emotionally exhausted,'' Lisbeth said, that it was
hard to rejoice. Also, knowing that the effects of the illness can
last for years, the Addisons were guarded.
</P>
<P>
   They had a right to be. On Thursday, July 9, Matthew was
readmitted to Kosair with intense abdominal pain. He was released
July 11.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the healing can begin for the Addisons, but Lisbeth said
her heart breaks for the Akin family, whom she called Saturday at
Scottish Rite.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told Randy after I got off the phone that I felt totally
worthless,'' she said, explaining that she had wanted to comfort
the family in some way. ``It's hard because you feel guilty.''

CART begins campaign to lower speeds
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By TERRY BLOUNT &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
BROOKLYN, Mich. _ They call it the Handford Device, which doesn't
mean much to most people. But the CART cars will have the new gizmo
in place this weekend to try to lower the speeds for the U.S. 500
at Michigan Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   Just think of it as CART's version of the restrictor plates
NASCAR uses at Daytona and Talladega.
</P>
<P>
   The two-mile, D-shaped oval will be the first test for the
wing-like Handford Device, which reduces downforce by 300 pounds
and increases drag.
</P>
<P>
   ``We felt by slowing the cars down a bit, we increase safety,''
said Kirk Russell, CART's vice president of competition. ``It also
enhances the ability of the drivers to race comfortably.''
</P>
<P>
   After Mauricio Gugelmin zoomed around the track at more than 240
mph on a qualifying run last fall in California, CART officials
felt something had to be done to slow the cars at the big ovals.
Gugelmin was one of the first drivers to test the new wing
attachment.
</P>
<P>
   ``It feels strange the first time you drive it,'' Gugelmin said.
``It's very draggy, like you've got a parachute on the back of the
car.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't have the same stability. We went 218 (mph) in
testing and learned a few things. I think we can get three or four
more mph out of it. It should minimize the advantage anyone has and
bring a closer race.''
</P>
<P>
   The Handford Device is a winglike aerodynamic piece fitted onto
the rear of the car. It is expected to reduce speeds by 15 to 20
mph.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any reduction of speed is welcome, however small,'' said
driver Gil de Ferran, who tested the wing a few weeks ago. ``It can
make a big difference in the event of an accident at these speeds.
I think this change will have an impact.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not that the drivers can't handle the speeds. That's not
the issue. It's just good common sense to see what can be done,
both from the safety end and to make the racing better for the
fans.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether better racing will be brought about by slowing the cars
remains to be seen. Restrictor-plate racing in NASCAR makes for
some exciting races because it causes the cars to bunch together.
But the drivers believe it also causes accidents.
</P>
<P>
   The Handford Device is a much different way of slowing a race
car because it does not affect the throttle response. Instead, it
makes the car less stable in the turns and causes the drivers to
slow down.
</P>
<P>
   ``This device is a big step in the right direction,'' said
Michael Andretti, who drives the Texaco Swift Ford. ``It sounds
like an easy thing to do, but it's not. For now, this is the best
solution.''
</P>
<P>
   The speed-reduction device was designed by Mark Handford of
Swift Engineering, which builds the chassis for the Newman/Haas
cars driven by Andretti and Christian Fittipaldi, and the Budweiser
car driven by Richie Hearn.
</P>
<P>
   That could bring up another problem if those cars are faster
than everyone else at Michigan. Andretti already has tested faster
than others. If he qualifies No. 1, some of the other CART teams
could cry foul and claim he had an unfair advantage.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Swift cars may have an edge,'' Hearn admitted. ``These
cars already have more downforce, so they may not lose as much
(speed) as the others.''
</P>
<P>
   Andretti said he has complete confidence in Handford's ability
to make a device that will work for everyone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have worked with Mark for years,'' Andretti said. ``He is
one of the best _ if not the best _ aerodynamicists around.''
</P>
<P>
   Bryan Herta, who tested the wing addition earlier this month,
isn't convinced the change will result in better racing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The car remained fairly stable for the most part, but it was
sliding a fair amount in the corners,'' Herta said. ``I think it
will be tougher to pass now than it has been in the past at this
track.''
</P>
<P>
   Andre Ribeiro, who drives a Marlboro Mercedes for Team Penske,
thinks the real test will come when the cars are racing in a pack.
</P>
<P>
   ``It certainly is going to reduce speeds,'' Ribeiro said. ``But
we will have to see how it runs in traffic. This is a much bigger
change than previous efforts to slow the cars. Testing and racing
are two different things. The effects the wing has on traffic still
are unknown.''
</P>
<P>
   Gugelmin is the driver who stands to lose the most since he was
the man who mastered the superspeedways by getting the most speed
out of his Hollywood Reynard Mercedes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a pretty good handle on things at the superspeedways,''
Gugelmin said. ``But now, we are learning the new package like
everyone else. It is going to take a lot of adjustments.''

U.S. GROUPS CHARGE PALESTINIANS WITH DISTORTING HOLOCAUST FACTS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)  (js) 
 By LAURIE GOODSTEIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   U.S. Jewish organizations and Holocaust scholars are calling on
Yasser Arafat to reprimand Palestinian officials and journalists
who have recently made statements that appear to distort the
history of the Holocaust or deny its existence.
</P>
<P>
   In a personal letter sent to the Palestinian leader Thursday,
the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations
condemned an article on July 2 in the Palestinian newspaper Al
Hayat al Jadida that called the Holocaust a ``deceitful myth.'' The
article said Jews had disseminated ``frightful pictures of mass
executions and invented the shocking story of the gas ovens, where
Hitler allegedly burned them.''
</P>
<P>
   Inflammatory remarks about the Holocaust in the Palestinian
press have also raised concerns among U.S. negotiators who are
struggling to revive the stalled Middle East peace effort, said a
State Department official.
</P>
<P>
   ``These sorts of issues come up unfortunately all too
frequently,'' the official said. ``And when they do, we repeat the
view to the Palestinian Authority that it's got to stop.''
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview, the Palestinian Authority minister for
higher education and research, Hanan Ashrawi, said she knew of no
Palestinian officials who had made statements distorting the
Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't deny the Holocaust,'' Ms. Ashrawi said. ``We don't
denigrate it. Actually we think recognition of the immorality of
the Holocaust is a basic moral component.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ashrawi said she was stunned to learn that U.S. Jewish
organizations were pursuing unattributed statements in Palestinian
newspapers as the peace effort was falling apart.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Jewish figure who initiated the campaign that accuses
Palestinian officials of denying the Holocaust is an outspoken
opponent of the peace effort, Morton Klein, president of the
Zionist Organization of America.
</P>
<P>
   Klein prompted the letter to Arafat and also an advertising
campaign this week in Jewish newspapers in 10 cities.
</P>
<P>
   Klein frequently gives speeches and writes editorials critical
of the peace effort because, he said, the Palestinians are not
honoring their commitments under the Oslo accords.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is hostile propaganda,'' Klein said of the Palestinian
press statements on the Holocaust, ``which is specifically
prohibited by the Oslo accords. This is not in isolation. If
everything else was going nicely this would not become a major
issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Israeli officials and Jews who monitor the Palestinian media say
they have documented a string of statements since the peace accords
were signed that minimize the number of victims of the Holocaust
and accuse the Jews of inventing the tragedy to win international
sympathy.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The letter states: ``There can be little hope for reconciliation
if people, especially the youth, are subject to constant
indoctrination portraying their neighbors in such vile ways. We
call on you, and the leadership of the Palestinian Authority, to
denounce this historical revisionism and declare as unacceptable
all written or oral denigration and diminution of the Holocaust.''
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli government and the Jerusalem Post refer to Al Hayat
al Jadida as the official Palestinian Authority newspaper. Yigal
Carmon, a former Israeli intelligence official who runs the Middle
East Media and Research Institute in Washington, said that the
Palestinian Authority pays staff salaries and that the editor in
chief is a member of the Palestinian Legislative Council.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ashrawi said that the Palestinian Authority had no official
newspaper and that the editors of Al Hayat al Jadida were
completely independent and ``write whatever they want to write.''
</P>
<P>
   If U.S. Jewish organizations take exception to something they
read there, Ms. Ashrawi added, they should write a response
directly to the paper.
</P>
<P>
   Klein has a list of statements and incidents that he says point
to a trend of Holocaust denial among Palestinian leaders. Citing a
Reuters article, Klein said that in January Palestinians in Gaza
held a rally at which they lauded Roger Garaudy, who was on trial
in Paris for denying the Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   According to the article, at that rally the Palestinian
Authority communications minister and its general secretary asked
the crowd to support Garaudy's views because movies and books had
exaggerated the Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty Jewish scholars and leaders of organizations,
representing a range of political opinions about the peace process,
signed the newspaper advertisements that condemned the Palestinian
Authority for ``denials and distortions of the Holocaust.'' Among
them were Michael Berenbaum, president of the Survivors of the
Shoah Visual History Foundation and a former director of the U.S.
Holocaust Memorial Museum; Neal Sher, former executive director of
the American Israel Political Action Committee; and Emil
Fackenheim, professor emeritus of Holocaust studies at Hebrew
University.
</P>
<P>
   Berenbaum, who is also a professor of theology at the University
of Judaism in Los Angeles, said:
</P>
<P>
   ``What makes my signature unusual is I generally am in favor of
the peace process and believe it is the only proper path for
Israel. Nevertheless, I believe the Palestinian Authority has to be
sensitive if it's going to pursue peace with Israel. It has to
resist the temptation to resort to tactics to increase its
credibility with its own reactionary fringes, just as Jews have to
resist that temptation as well.''
</P>
<P>
   Holocaust denial is an ``old habit'' for some Palestinians,
Berenbaum said, because ``the Palestinians perceive themselves as
having to pay the price for the victimization of the Jews in World
War II.''
</P>
<P>
   On Arafat's trip to the United States in January, the U.S.
Holocaust Memorial Museum invited him to tour the museum, then
revoked the invitation because of disagreements among its staff,
then extended it again. Arafat ultimately declined the invitation.
</P>
<P>
   While in Amsterdam, Netherlands, in March, Arafat toured the
Anne Frank House Museum. He pledged to share with fellow
Palestinians his impressions of the cramped house where the little
girl hid from the Nazis with her family.
</P>
<P>
   ``This story is not to be repeated for our children or for their
children,'' Arafat said, referring to Palestinian and Israeli
youngsters.

<P>
   ``I was going to hang it up last May,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And this city would be about as good a place to do it as any.
</P>
<P>
   But then Furillo wakes up at his home in nearby Palm Desert,
reads the sports sections in his den with his dog, Rip, and the
enthusiasm that propelled him through more than a half-century of a
career in sports journalism starts all over again.
</P>
<P>
   He simply can't wait to drive over to the radio studios of KPSI,
920 on the AM dial, and start prepping for his weekday, 4 to 6 p.m.
sports-talk show.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the highlight of my day,'' said Furillo, who's been doing
his show in Palm Springs for four years, with the last 5{ months at
KPSI.
</P>
<P>
   He then qualifies his statement: ``It's the best thing I do all
day.''
</P>
<P>
   From Furillo, you won't get any smack talk, no blathering on
about what's wrong with sports today from the mouth of someone
who's been there and done that. Just as he did in his 10 years as
the ``SportsTalk'' host of KABC's popular show in the '70s and
'80s, Furillo keeps his ``Steam Room'' show more on the lighter
side.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's too much negativity in today's media anyway,'' said
Furillo, who started as a sportswriter in 1945 and considers
himself to this day as a newspaper man. ``Nothing positive comes
from negative thinking. And people still like to read nice things
about people.''
</P>
<P>
   With 39-year-old producer/co-host Steve Kelly to bounce off of,
Furillo pulls it off. But it doesn't mean Furillo ignores current
affairs.
</P>
<P>
   On his shows this past week, in fact, the Dodgers have been a
topic almost as hot as the weather.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, Furillo interviewed former Dodgers general manager Fred
Claire, who said he was asked about firing then-manager Bill
Russell by team president Bob Graziano right after the blockbuster
deal with the Florida Marlins. Claire said he thought it was better
to let things settle down and then talk about it around the
All-Star break. Soon enough, Russell and Claire were fired.
</P>
<P>
   Claire also admitted he didn't consider a trade for Cincinnati
reliever Jeff Shaw specifically because of his multi-year contract
that allows him to demand a trade. Claire said that's what happened
several years ago when he obtained Jesse Orosco from the New York
Mets.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, current GM-in-training Tom Lasorda came on, and Furillo
asked him about his relationship with Russell. Lasorda admitted
he's upset because Russell never thanked him for recommending him
for the manager's job when Lasorda stepped down in the middle of
the '96 season.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, Graziano was Furillo's guest. Graziano admitted that
the team had seriously considered firing Russell last season.
</P>
<P>
   Hear any of that kind of stuff on L.A. sports talk shows?
</P>
<P>
   Even in Palm Springs, L.A. sports are the talk of the town.
</P>
<P>
   ``This city is full of former L.A. residents who want to keep up
on what's going on,'' said Furillo, who, when let go from KABC in
'87 because of ratings, went to work in Sacramento, where he'd be
closer to his ailing mother.
</P>
<P>
   Although Furillo returns to L.A. occasionally _ he'll be in
Anaheim next week to see the Yankees, and has plans to attend USC's
football opener against Purdue in August _ his health prevents him
from making more visits.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know me _ nobody loved L.A. more than I did when I was
there,'' said the legendary bombastic sports editor of the former
Los Angeles Herald Examiner from 1967 to '74.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I think it's a tragedy that no one seems to care about the
history of L.A. sports anymore. I find it offensive that no one
seems to have a sense of that city.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no `now' without a `then,' and nobody knows that
anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   But as long as Furillo has a voice _ even if it's in Palm
Springs, where on a good night the signal from the 5,000-watt
station gets all the way down to Rialto _ he'll make sure no one
forgets.
</P>
<P>
   BLAH, BLAH, BLAH...
</P>

ESPN2, interrupted a very important taped AMA motocross race). With
viewers unable to hear the questions coming off camera, our TV
shows us Policy and his former boss sitting at a table with a glass
of water and blank looks on their faces. Then they utter things
like: ``No.'' Or: ``That wasn't part of our thinking.'' And:
``You'd have to ask him about that.'' And then: ``To answer the
first part, maybe, but I can't get into that right now.''
Compelling TV? You know the answer to that one.

GAILEY'S TRAINING CAMP MORE DISCIPLINED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By CLARENCE E. HILL JR. 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WICHITA FALLS, Texas _ Cowboys training camp no longer has the
head-banging feel of past years, when the team daily conducted
full-speed tackling.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Chan Gailey has yet to turn loose with live hitting and
has shunned some of the physical drills that require tackling, such
as the middle drill and the inside run.
</P>
<P>
   ``Camp Chan'' is organized, detail-oriented, time-management
conscious and disciplined.
</P>
<P>
   After one week at Midwestern State University, Gailey has
implemented his plans for training a football team.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, we've all got a job to do,'' Gailey said. ``I
understand their time, and they understand the team time. The key
is having everybody on the same page, doing the same things. And
it's being most productive with the time you have. It's having a
mutual respect for each other.''
</P>
<P>
   Gailey has not been an attention-getting screamer, such as Jimmy
Johnson, or as laid-back as Barry Switzer. Cowboys players, staff
and training camp onlookers repeatedly use one word to describe
Gailey's training camp: efficient.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's organized,'' said Cowboys deep snapper Dale Hellestrae,
who has endured Cowboys training camps under Johnson, Switzer and
now Gailey. ``Chan knows what he wants to get done. Everything is
done with a purpose for us to get better and headed in the right
direction.''
</P>
<P>
   Camp Chan has featured two prominent departures from the past _
more discipline and more meetings.
</P>
<P>
   Citing ``the pace of training camp'' and ``the demands of
training camp,'' Cowboys owner Jerry Jones said there are more
meetings than in the past.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have always had very successful training camps,'' Jones
said. ``I thought we had our most successful training camp last
year. The effort is not better. But there are specific things that
are different.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's more demanding on our staff. Not just in numbers of
meetings but in length of meetings. We are definitely spending more
time involved in preparation. Everybody understands that this is
what it's going to take.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the discipline, much has been made of the penalty laps
players have to run for committing pre-snap penalties and breaking
undisclosed rules. Gailey's impact comes through in this aspect of
camp.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could fine them $50, but they'd pay that in a heartbeat,''
Gailey said. ``They don't want to run around that field.''
</P>
<P>
   Though nobody likes to run them, the players consider it
necessary in the wake of the team's penchant for drive-killing
penalties during last season's 6-10 campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something good,'' cornerback Kevin Smith said. ``A lot of
small penalties hurt us last year. It gets guys mentally prepared
to play.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Cowboys receiver Michael Irvin: ``We welcome anything to
make sure that what happened last year doesn't happen this year. If
penalty laps are about it, if that's going to make a difference,
that's great. You don't see anybody complaining.''
</P>
<P>
   Even as the Cowboys try to shy away from comparisons to last
year, their descriptions and emphasis on how structured and tidy
things are under Gailey are evidence that detailed organization
wasn't a strong suit of Switzer or Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hate to compare,'' Cowboys defensive coordinator Dave Campo
said. ``But what we are doing is making sure everything is
structured as a staff and as a team. We've done that by having
meetings with Chan. We know what the practice schedule is going to
be like. Here is where we are working. The meetings start on time
and end on time. And everything is structured for everybody to be
together as a team. That's Chan's strength.''
</P>
<P>
   Campo said Gailey's style has made the coaches more accountable.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm more accountable ... because of the newness,'' Campo said.
``For nine years, I had two different coaches. But everything was
the same. I never had to adapt. Now I have to kick my game up a
notch.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones said altering last season's performance was why he hired
Gailey, and the training-camp changes are just a byproduct of that
decision. He said they are also added proof that Gailey was the
right choice.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of that fits really well with our goals with when we got
here, which was get in here, do some things differently,'' Jones
said. ``If you are going to make changes, an individual with his
skill, work ethic and penchant for detail is the ideal person to be
managing it.''

SENATE LEADERS DECIDE AGAINST PUSH FOR BIG TAX CUT THIS YEAR 
</HEADLINE>
  (EXCLUSIVE; 10:45 p.m. ET EMBARGO for print media; 12:01 a.m. ET
EMBARGO for electronic media.) 
(sw) 
 By RICHARD W. STEVENSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Republican leaders in the Senate have decided it
would be futile to push for a big tax cut this year, infuriating
conservatives in both the House and Senate who had hoped the
prospect of huge federal budget surpluses would lead to swift
passage of sweeping tax reductions, members of Congress and aides
said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The split within the party, which has been festering for months
and erupted during a closed-door meeting of Republican leaders on
Wednesday night, complicated and perhaps doomed efforts by the
party's tax-cutting wing to ram through an election-year tax
package that would set up a potent confrontation with congressional
Democrats and President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Republican aides said Senate leaders saw no prospect of passing
any big tax cut because doing so would require 60 votes, far more
than the party, which holds 55 seats, has any chance of mustering.
And they said the benefits of waging a symbolic fight were
outweighed by the risks, including the certainty that Clinton would
accuse them of risking Social Security's long-term health to give
tax cuts to the wealthy.
</P>
<P>
   House Republicans, who have been pushing for a tax cut of
historic magnitude as the nation enters a new era of fiscal health,
said on Thursday that they were intent on following through with
plans to vote in September on a tax reduction of as much as $700
billion over the next decade.
</P>
<P>
   Conservatives said a House vote might then force the Senate to
reconsider before Congress adjourns in October, and they expressed
optimism that Senate leaders might still change their minds. But
they admitted that the current lack of support from Senate leaders
clearly endangered their efforts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, the Senate's leadership is the weak link in the
drive for real tax cuts this year,'' said Sen. John Ashcroft,
R-Mo., who has been pressing the leadership for a big tax cut.
</P>
<P>
   Ashcroft said that it would be ``an egregious mistake'' for the
Senate to give up on a big tax cut this year. Doing so, he said,
would lead to disillusionment among Republican voters and cast into
doubt Republican efforts to keep control of the House.
</P>
<P>
   Both parties have been struggling for months to adapt their
politics and policies to the prospect of ever-larger budget
surpluses. But the battle over taxes has heated up just in the last
week, after the Congressional Budget Office more than doubled its
estimate of the surplus over the next decade.
</P>
<P>
   The budget office said the federal government would have a
surplus over the next decade of $1.55 trillion. Of that amount,
though, all but about $1.4 trillion would come from Social Security
payroll tax revenue in excess of what Social Security needs to pay
current benefits.
</P>
<P>
   But Republican leaders _ including Sens. William V. Roth Jr. of
Delaware, the chairman of the Finance Committee, and Pete Domenici
of New Mexico, the chairman of the Budget Committee _ feel that it
would be futile and politically unwise to try and pass a big tax
bill before Congress adjourns in early October, aides said.
</P>
<P>
   Any tax cut that dipped into the surplus would require Congress
to waive its current budget rules, a maneuver that would require 60
votes in the Senate, a hurdle that Republican have no hope of
overcoming, aides said. And they said there was a strong sense
within the Senate that dealing with Social Security should come
ahead of any major tax-cutting package that relied on the surplus.
Indeed, they said, the $700 billion, 10-year tax cut being
developed in the House relies on changes in the way the federal
government accounts for Social Security payroll tax revenue. The
change, they said, would limit the interest paid to the Social
Security trust fund, leaving Republicans all the more exposed to
Democratic attacks. Clinton has stepped up his warnings to
Republicans in the last week not to use any of the surplus for tax
cuts until Social Security has been fixed.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Republicans said they had not ruled out a modest tax cut,
of as much as $70 billion over five years, that would be paid for
by raising other taxes and trimming spending. But many
conservatives said that is far too little.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Congressional aides said Senate leaders listed a series of
reasons during Wednesday night's meeting why Republicans should not
push right now for a large-scale tax cut.
</P>
<P>
   House Speaker Newt Gingrich; Rep. John Kasich of Ohio, the
chairman of the Budget Committee, and other House leaders who were
present at the meeting have been pushing in recent days for
hundreds of billions of dollars in tax cuts over the next decade.
They said new surplus estimates from the Congressional Budget
Office make clear that the nation can save Social Security and
still have plenty of money left over for major tax reductions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not a single senator spoke up in favor of what the House is
doing,'' said a senior Republican aide who was present at the
meeting. ``They're nervous.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the other Republicans attending the meeting were Sens.
Trent Lott of Mississippi, the majority leader, Connie Mack of
Florida and Don Nickles of Oklahoma, and Reps. Dick Armey, Tom
DeLay and Bill Archer, all of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Several House Republicans said they still believed that the
Senate could be sold on the political and economic wisdom of a big
tax cut, especially if the House took the lead and passed a bill.
</P>
<P>
   Christina Martin, Gingrich's spokeswoman, said on Thursday that
the House leadership viewed the meeting as just the beginning of a
process that would lead to a major tax package. Gingrich has been
pressing in recent days for a plan that would cut taxes for many
two-income couples, reduce the capital gains and estate taxes and
provide tax breaks for the elderly.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were plenty of colorful exchanges,'' Ms. Martin said in
describing the meeting. But she added that Republicans were
``making progress towards a big tax cut,'' and that the session was
only ``the first meeting in a series of meetings.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Kasich defended his plan as protecting Social
Security while returning the surplus to taxpayers and insuring that
Washington does not use the excess money in coming years to
increase the size of government.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not surprised that some of my colleagues in the Senate are
not enthusiastic about this,'' Kasich said. ``This is the same U.S.
Senate that's not able to pass a spending cut bill.''
</P>
<P>
   But Kasich said congressional leaders are already on the verge
of spending some of the surplus, and that he would continue to
rally support from around the country to push through as big a tax
cut as possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``To take the surplus and increase the size of government
defeats the whole reason we came to power,'' Kasich said.

KEEPING CURRENT: ELECTRICS IN NEW YORK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, July 26)  
 (af)  
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ There are few charging stations. Cold winters shorten
the range of some batteries. Aside from dedicated
environmentalists, the public has been slow to embrace electric
cars, given their comparatively high prices and short leashes. Yet
a New York state law requires seven major auto makers to sell a
total of 7,800 zero-emission cars in the current model year.
</P>
<P>
   The law is being challenged in court, and hardly anyone expects
auto companies to end up paying billions of dollars in penalties
for failing to meet the mandate. Still, a number of companies are
offering EVs in New York, partly to demonstrate how advanced _ and
how limited _ their technology is, and partly to convince
politicians that few New Yorkers are ready for EVs.
</P>
<P>
   Here is a list of the electric vehicles that leading
manufacturers currently offer, or soon will, in New York state:
</P>
<P>
   CHEVROLET S-10 ELECTRIC: Compact pickup; lead-acid batteries.
Range: 40 to 60 miles. Available from seven dealers in the state.
Base price: $34,289 including delivery; leases available.
</P>
<P>
   CHRYSLER EPIC VAN: Minivan, nickel-metal hydride batteries.
Range 80 to 90 miles. Available this fall to fleets only from
participating Chrysler-Plymouth and Dodge dealers. (Available to
consumers this winter.) Lease is $450 a month for 36 months.
</P>
<P>
   FORD RANGER ELECTRIC: Compact pickup; lead-acid batteries.
Range: 50 to 60 miles. Available at eight dealers. 1998 price:
$27,795. Lease: $637 a month for 36 months.
</P>
<P>
   HONDA EV PLUS: Subcompact hatchback; nickel-metal-hydride
batteries. Range: 70 to 80 miles. Available from Paragon House of
Honda, Woodside, Queens. Lease: $455 a month for 36 months,
including insurance and maintenance, with no down payment.
</P>

available). Range: 40 to 50 miles. Available from Solectria, 33
Industrial Way, Wilmington, Mass. (978) 658-2231. Price: $33,995
plus delivery charges.
</P>
<P>
   TOYOTA RAV4-EV: Compact sport utility; nickel-metal-hydride.

SENATE PANEL DROPS BILL REQUIRING SANCTIONS FOR RELIGIOUS
PERSECUTION 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Okla., Neb., Conn., Miss.)  (th) 
 By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Legislation to require the U.S. government to
punish foreign countries that permit or endorse religious
persecution was put off indefinitely Thursday by a Senate committee
because Republicans were deeply divided over the issue.
</P>
<P>
   The measure, which pits social conservatives like the Christian
Coalition against business interests like the Chamber of Commerce
and the major farm organizations, is strongly opposed by the
administration.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate Foreign Relations Committee removed the bill from its
docket Thursday because at least three of the panel's 10
Republicans planned to join the eight Democrats in voting to reject
the legislation.
</P>
<P>
   It is not likely that any such measure will be enacted this
year.
</P>
<P>
   The bill was brought down by the fissure in the Republican party
between conservative Christians, the party's foot soldiers, who say
the party's main focus should be on morality, and business leaders,
who provide the Republicans' financial base and want the party to
concentrate on issues like trade, taxes and prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   In May the House approved a bill under which countries that
engaged in religious persecution would face an automatic suspension
of most aid from the United States, restrictions on trade with this
country and American opposition to loans from international
financial institutions. People who could show that they were
victims of religious persecution would be given special immigration
rights.
</P>
<P>
   Among the countries the sponsors focused on were China, the
Sudan, Pakistan and Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
   The bill passed by a huge majority, 375-41, far beyond the
two-thirds vote needed to override any presidential veto.
</P>
<P>
   But the House bill stood little chance in the Senate because of
solid Republican opposition there to automatic economic sanctions.
For the last several months, Sen. Don Nickles, R-Okla., has been
working on a compromise.
</P>
<P>
   The latest version of his legislation would have the government
publish a list of countries declared guilty of religious
persecution and would allow the president responses ranging from
mild diplomatic protest to strict economic sanctions. This is the
bill the Foreign Relations Committee was to vote on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want a solution where you don't have to shoot someone to get
their attention,'' Nickles said.
</P>
<P>
   But the Nickles modification did not satisfy the wing of the
Republican Party that represents business interests.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Chuck Hagel of Nebraska, the leader of the Republican
opposition to the bill in the committee, said the bill would put
the United States in the position of alienating some of its most
valuable diplomatic friends and economic partners.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be supremely arrogant for us to grade every country
on earth,'' he said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn., who is not on the Foreign
Relations Committee but has been working closely with Nickles,
said, ``I think we should make the statement that religious freedom
is an important element of our foreign policy.''
</P>
<P>
   Randy Tate, executive director of the Christian Coalition,
agreed, calling the bill ``a historic opportunity to protect people
of faith around the globe.''
</P>
<P>
   The argument of the White House and the State Department,
endorsed by almost all Democrats in the Senate and by Hagel and his
Republican allies, is that it is a mistake for Congress to restrict
the president's running room on foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
   Just last month President Clinton was required by law to impose
rigid economic sanctions on India and Pakistan after those
countries tested nuclear devices. Congress quickly agreed that the
inflexible law was a mistake. Within days farmers complained about
their inability to sell wheat to Pakistan, and the ban on
agriculture exports was repealed.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is not a senator who's not opposed to religious
persecution,'' said Hagel. ``But in foreign policy, you rarely have
the opportunity to choose between all good and all bad. You have to
weigh the nuances carefully.''
</P>
<P>
   Some measure involving religious persecution abroad could still
come before the Senate in September. Senate Majority Leader Trent
Lott, R-Miss., has promised a Senate vote on the bill passed by the
House before Congress adjourns in early October. Nickles said he
was still working on a compromise.
</P>
<P>
   But it is clear from the lineup in the Foreign Relations
Committee on Thursday that no bill with teeth can pass the Senate.
And almost certainly, too little time is left in this session of
Congress to reconcile the differences between a watered-down Senate
bill and the strict sanctions approved by the House. &QL;

IBM TO PAY MEXICO CITY MILLIONS FOR FAILED SYSTEM 
</HEADLINE>
  (cb) 
 By SAM DILLON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ The Mexican unit of IBM has agreed to pay Mexico
City $37.5 million in cash and new computer products to resolve a
dispute over a failed data base system that it sold the city. But
three executives will still face trial on charges of conspiring to
defraud the city in the deal, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement, announced Wednesday evening, appeared to be an
admission by the unit, IBM de Mexico, that its executives had acted
inappropriately in the course of selling the nearly $26 million
computer system two years ago. But it also underlined how the rules
of business are changing as opposition parties gain increasing
power in Mexico, where corruption has been a pervasive commercial
lubricant.
</P>
<P>
   Officials from Mexico's governing party bought the system from
IBM without competitive bidding in 1996. But the district attorney,
who is from the opposition party that won city elections last year,
questioned the deal and pressed criminal charges.
</P>
<P>
   John Reilly, an IBM spokesman for Latin America, said Thursday
that the agreement reached with city officials resolved the civil
dispute and underlined the company's ``commitment to customer
satisfaction.'' He insisted that the executives had not been guilty
of any wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   But Rogelio Ramirez de la O, an economist who is a prominent
consultant to foreign businesses here, said that ``IBM could never
have been forced to give up so much unless the government had
proved its accusations.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This agreement makes clear that IBM's dealings here were a
flop if not completely fraudulent,'' Ramirez de la O said.
</P>
<P>
   The computer giant's troubles here come on the heels of a larger
but similar scandal in Argentina, where officials are investigating
whether bribes were paid in order for its Argentine unit to win a
$250 million government contract. Earlier this month, apparently in
response to the criminal investigations in Argentina and Mexico,
IBM said it would no longer sign computer services agreements with
Latin American governments without first engaging in competitive
bidding.
</P>
<P>
   The system purchased by Mexico City officials belonging to
President Ernesto Zedillo's Institutional Revolutionary Party, or
PRI, in 1996 included 57 computer servers, 2,100 personal
computers, and software that the company said would help
prosecutors in 130 city offices keep track of hundreds of thousands
of criminal cases.
</P>
<P>
   But District Attorney Samuel del Villar, who was appointed by
the opposition Mayor Cuauhtemoc Cardenas in December to reduce
crime and attack corruption, said that shortly after he took
office, he discovered that the system was so overwhelmed with
glitches that it was paralyzing law-enforcement operations.
</P>
<P>
   After months of negotiations with IBM de Mexico aimed at making
the system operable, he said, he decided to pull the plug in May.
Last month, del Villar charged three executives and 19 current and
former city officials with conspiracy.
</P>
<P>
   At the heart of the criminal case, he said, is an ordinance
outlawing large city purchases without competitive bidding. IBM de
Mexico sought to have the charges thrown out, but on Tuesday a
judge ordered the three executives to face trial.
</P>
<P>
   Also on Tuesday, in a parallel action in the civil part of the
dispute, del Villar and IBM's general manager in Mexico, Alfredo
Capote, signed a legal agreement and later issued a four-paragraph
joint statement. ``After talks between the two parties,'' it said
in part, ``IBM de Mexico has demonstrated its disposition to work
together with the District Attorney's office'' to help the District
Attorney complete its technology-modernization program.
</P>
<P>
   Del Villar, detailing the agreement to reporters late Wednesday,
said that the company had agreed to pay $25.9 million, the cost of
the original contract, by offering that amount in credit for new
computer equipment and services. In addition, it agreed to pay
$11.6 million in damages to the district attorney's office. Del
Villar said the company had already made an initial payment of $2
million toward the damages and would pay the rest over a year in
monthly installments.
</P>
<P>
   The district attorney added that ``this agreement is going to
help our office a great deal, especially in light of the budget
cuts we've suffered this year.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Reilly, the IBM spokesman, said that the financial terms of
the agreement were supposed to be kept confidential, and declined
to confirm or dispute the figures cited by del Villar.
</P>
<P>
   ``In any complex systems-integration project, technical issues
will arise,'' O'Reilly said, ``and we've always been 100 percent
committed to resolving them, in this case in a way that benefits
the law-enforcement process in Mexico City. This civil agreement
allows us to continue to work together with this customer.''

SMALL CHILDREN FOUND HELPING IN ARIZONA'S ONION HARVEST 
</HEADLINE>
 KIDS-AZR   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By GRACIELA SEVILLA  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED _ Four-year-old Octavio is too young to go to
kindergarten, but he isn't too young to be out in the onion fields
at sunrise helping his dad earn the struggling family's keep.
</P>
<P>
   Sifting through the dirt, Octavio would pick up an onion bulb in
each small hand and carry them to his dad, who would clip the roots
and green tops and add them to the pile in the plastic bucket.
</P>
<P>
   Down the row, Octavio's 7-year-old brother also was picking
onions. At the end of the day, the boy's father would be paid 50
cents for each filled 10-gallon sack. The boys earned no money,
just the pride of working side by side with their father and
contributing to the family finances.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was obvious they were working,'' said Esther La Plante, a
federal labor inspector who fined the grower and labor contractor
for having the children at work. ``We didn't catch all the kids in
that one crew; they disappeared behind cars and behind trees.''
</P>
<P>
   Harvesting the fruits and vegetables that grow on Arizona's
farms and feed the nation is hard, harsh work, but Octavio was one
of a dozen children ages 4 to 11 found laboring in Maricopa
County's onion fields in May by U.S. Department of Labor
investigators.
</P>
<P>
   The Labor Department is fining the growers and labor contractors
involved nearly $20,000 for violating federal child labor
prohibitions. The violators were notified last week of the
penalties and have 15 days to appeal.
</P>
<P>
   ``A 4-year-old working in the onion fields is a disgrace,''
Secretary of Labor Alexis M. Herman said ``Farm worker families
sometimes feel they have no choice but to take their children with
them to the fields. But this 4-year-old was working not playing.
This should never happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, 60 years after Congress made it illegal to employ
children under age 12 in agriculture, child farm workers remain a
hidden _ though not uncommon _ reality on the nation's commercial
farms.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the federal government began cracking down on
employment of young children picking crops. So far, labor
investigators found 50 child farm workers in Texas, New Mexico and
Louisiana, in addition to those discovered in Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   ``Children who work in agriculture . . . are among the most
vulnerable of America's workers. They are often robbed of
educational opportunities, exposed to dangerous pesticides and
equipment, and often perform difficult manual labor in order to
bring food to America's tables,'' said John R. Fraser, acting
administrator of the Labor Department's Wage and Hour Division.
</P>
<P>
   Nationwide, about 200,000 children work on farms and in
agricultural processing, according to the Labor Department. But
children under the age of 12 who work the harvest illegally are
uncounted. The law says children can work on farms at age 12 if
their parents own the farms or if they are accompanied by their
parent. Otherwise, they must be at least 14 to be eligible to work
after school hours in non-hazardous tasks.
</P>
<P>
   There is general agreement that children 11 and under are too
young to toil in fields. But the government, growers and farm
workers also agree that for some farm-working parents, turning work
into a family affair is a necessity.
</P>
<P>
   Carmen Leon, now an educator in Cashion, was a third-grader when
she joined her parents and siblings in the fields.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pride to know you earned that little bit of money with
your sweat,'' she said, recalling the days spent picking cotton,
onions, potatoes or lettuce. ``It was money to pay the electric
bills, the rent and to buy food.''
</P>
<P>
   Leon and others who helped harvest as young children, say
parents are forced by low wages and lack of available child care to
take their children with them to the fields. Once there, growers
refer to the children as ``little loose change'' and typically turn
a blind eye to the littlest workers.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the three Valley growers fined this month say they don't
want young children picking their crops and have asked parents to
keep them out of the fields. But they say they cannot police their
crews of 200 or more workers closely enough to prevent kids from
joining their parents in the harvest. The third grower fined could
not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Federal investigators found a 10-year-old girl and two boys,
ages 6 and 10, working Rousseau Farming's onion fields in Tolleson
on a Saturday. The grower was fined $2,975 as a result while the
labor contractor who supplied the workers was fined $1,175.
</P>
<P>
   ``They weren't there because we hired them, they were there
because their parents brought them along,'' said David Rousseau,
owner of Rousseau Farming, one of the Valley growers sanctioned by
the Labor Department.
</P>
<P>
   Some of his workers, Rousseau believes, have little choice but
to bring their kids with them. If they don't, he said, then
``either the kids are being left unattended or the family can't
afford to work because of the cost of child care.''
</P>
<P>
   Investigators targeted five onion fields around the Valley on
two consecutive weekends in May. La Plante said she and other
investigators were careful to document the children at work,
watching and taking photographs and videotape, before writing up
the violations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We saw some children clipping onions. Some gathered the onions
and some were working to fill their own sacks and buckets,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   But Rousseau disagrees with the investigator's perception that
the children were doing actual work. Another sanctioned grower,
Eugene Waddell said the 8-, 9- and 11-year-old boys he was fined
for were there visiting their father and grandfather. Both growers
are appealing the penalties.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona is only the latest state where illegal child laborers
have been discovered. Around the country, investigators for the
Department of Labor are finding child labor violations during
surprise checks on farms.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the ``Salad Bowl'' initiative, inspectors are
targeting lettuce, tomato, cucumber, onion and garlic fields.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have found other child-labor violations involving fairly
large numbers of kids in the Rio Grande Valley and southeastern New
Mexico,'' Fraser said.
</P>
<P>
   Fraser notes that many growers and their labor contractors make
a bona fide effort to obey the child labor restrictions, but
unscrupulous employers will take advantage of the savings that
unpaid child labor brings them.
</P>
<P>
   ``The unfortunate fact is that there are some, a minority, who
feel that their competitiveness depends on their taking whatever
shortcuts they can take,'' Fraser said. ``That may mean using young
workers.''
</P>
<P>
   Department of Labor officials say they are determined to stop
child labor violations on farms.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cannot accept a situation where children 4, 6, 7 or even 11
are working in the fields,'' said Bernard Anderson, assistant
secretary for the department's Employment Standards
Administration. &QL;

DOW PLUNGES 195.93 POINTS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (EDS: Repeating for all needing.)  (th) 
 By SHARON R. KING    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ While second-quarter corporate earnings have come in
largely better than expected, a smattering of disappointing reports
and renewed fears about Asia sent stocks reeling Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average plunged 195.93 points, or 2.15
percent, to 8,932,98, its first close below 9,000 since June 30.
The blue-chip measure has fallen more than 400 points from its high
of 9,337.97 on last Friday. Thursday's free fall was the
third-sharpest drop in the Dow this year, after a 2.34 percent
decline on June 15 and a 2.85 percent drop on Jan. 9.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing led the decline, falling 6.75 and accounting for 27.8
points of the Dow's rout, after reporting lower than expected
earnings.
</P>
<P>
   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index dove 24.33 points, or 2.09
percent, to 1,139.75. Microsoft, whose giant market capitalization
gives it enormous clout in the index, was the leading decliner,
falling 3.75 points to 113. The one-day fall wiped off $9.2 billion
of the company's market value.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq composite index fared better. It closed down 34.53
points, or 1.75 percent, at 1,935.22.
</P>
<P>
   In recent days, a diverse group of companies, including Merck,
McDonald's, Coca-Cola and DuPont, have cautioned investors that
earnings in the second half of the year could falter in part
because of the continuing economic crisis in Asia. For some of
these companies, the red flag was the first this year, leading
stock analysts and investors to fret about how long the Asian flu
will persist.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing said Thursday that second-quarter earnings fell 46
percent, to $258 million, or 26 cents a diluted share _ sharply
lower than analysts' estimates of 33 cents a share. The company
also warned that results for this year and next would be
substantially weaker than Wall Street forecasts.
</P>
<P>
   Although Sears, Roebuck &AMP; Co. reported Thursday that profits
rose 2.3 percent on strong sales, its stock fell 5.375 to 51 5/16
on continuing worries about its credit card business. Delinquencies
are high, and the company anticipates a 15 percent decline in
earnings at the unit for the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``One day it's Merck, the next day it's Disney and then it's
Boeing,'' said Marshall Acuff, equity strategist with Salomon Smith
Barney. ``People are starting to say, `If the best of the market
can't do it, who can?'''
</P>
<P>
   Investors were also rattled by two days of congressional
testimony by Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, who warned
that the Asian crisis was far from over and that the stock market
could fall sharply at some point.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think people were listening to the Fed chairman, and he was
right,'' said Charles Johnson, head equity trader at Blaylock &AMP;
Partners in Baltimore. ``These valuations are not sustainable in
terms of earnings.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Before profit reports began in earnest in mid-July, stock
analysts forecast a 1.3 percent increase in earnings for the
companies in the S&AMP;P 500 in the second quarter. In the first
quarter, earnings grew 3.8 percent for the companies in the index.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 333 index members that have reported thus far, the
earnings of 202 firms, or 60 percent, exceeded analysts' forecasts.
That number is slightly above the average of 55 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, only 13 percent, or 44 firms, reported earnings
that were below forecasts, according to First Call Corp., a Boston
research company that tracks analysts estimates. That number is
below the 25 percent average for such negative reports. Based on
those figures, earnings are now expected to grow 4.1 percent in the
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   But companies are exceeding estimates that have already been
ratcheted down sharply by analysts. At the beginning of the year,
growth in earnings a share for the S&AMP;P 500 in the second quarter
was forecast at 12.9 percent. The forecast dropped sharply to 6.1
percent in April and then to just 1.3 percent, according to First
Call data.
</P>
<P>
   ``We made it pretty easy to meet or beat expectations,'' said
Robert Froehlich, chief investment strategist at Scudder Kemper
Investments. ``If you lower the bar enough, even I can jump over
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Adding to investors' concerns about Asia was a warning from
credit rating agency Moody's Investors Service that it might lower
its ratings on some Japanese government debt.
</P>
<P>
   It said it was reviewing the government's high-grade credit
rating on yen and foreign currency-denominated debt and bank
deposits due to ``deep structural problems in Japan's economy that
have defied conventional policy remedies.'' &QL;

BOEING STOCK PLUMMETS ON BAD EARNINGS REPORT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By KAREN WEST  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ The Boeing Co. dished out a platter of disappointing
news for financial analysts Thursday, reporting a 46 percent drop
in second-quarter profits and predicting lower-than-expected
earnings for this year and next.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street was swift to show its displeasure as Boeing's stock
plunged 13.7 percent to a two-year low of $41.25.
</P>
<P>
   It was the most active issue on the New York Stock Exchange and
accounted for about 26 points of the Dow's 195.93-point tumble.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing also said it will cut 18,000 to 28,000 jobs by the end of
next year through attrition and layoffs _ up to 8,000 more than
what has been previously announced. The company now employs 238,000
people in 27 states.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing officials have not said exactly how many job cuts will
occur or where they will originate, but the reductions are expected
to be spread throughout the company. Included in the overall number
are 12,000 previously announced reductions from Boeing's commercial
aircraft division, headquartered in Renton, Wash.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, job cuts could come from further consolidation of
Boeing operations throughout the country which the company expects
to announce next month.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in recent history, Boeing executives outlined
for analysts a series of financial goals to boost shareholder value
and disclosed profit projections, including earnings estimates of
$1 billion this year and $2 billion next year.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing historically has not disclosed long-term earnings
projections or profit margin goals. But executives have promised
more detailed quarterly updates from now on as the company shifts
its focus from being technically adept at building airplanes to
being able to build a financial powerhouse. Boeing officials also
will use the periodic updates to reassure stockholders that it is
on the road to profitability.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has been a performance driven industry _ higher, faster,
farther,'' Boeing Chairman Phil Condit told analysts in a
conference call. ``We are now going to be a financially driven
company.''
</P>
<P>
   But Boeing's financial frankness was a rude awakening for
analysts who have been basing high profit expectations on the
company's past performance and limited accounting information.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've told us more today than in the whole 20-plus years
I've been following the company,'' said analyst Paul Nisbet with
JSA Research Inc., who has a ``buy'' rating on Boeing stock. ``But
what we heard was shocking. Everybody thought they would be making
a lot more money.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Now it's punishment time,'' he said, referring to Boeing's
dramatic $6.50 drop in stock to $41.25.
</P>
<P>
   In separate conference calls with analysts and the news media,
Condit said the company expects to earn about $1 billion this year,
less than 2 percent of expected sales, but has set a goal of
boosting net return on sales to 7 percent by the year 2000 at the
earliest.
</P>
<P>
   Condit acknowledged that achieving the 7 percent goal in the
next two years ``is clearly a difficult goal _ not one that this
company has ever reached before.''
</P>
<P>
   He predicted profits will double to $2 billion next year with a
net return on sales of 3 to 4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing's earnings projections were far short of the $1.65
billion profit analysts were expecting for this year and $3.2
billion profit for next year, according to First Call's survey of
analysts.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the first time they are giving us a clue as to what is
going on,'' Nisbet said. ``Expectations were getting out of hand
because of the lack of guidance from the company.''
</P>
<P>
   But he said Boeing's long-term financial picture is still good,
noting that ``the company is doing too much business to not be
making money.''
</P>
<P>
   Condit predicted this year's total sales will be $56 billion,
jumping to $58 billion next year.
</P>
<P>
   The company still expects to deliver 550 commercial aircraft
this year and predicts it will deliver 620 next year.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing said second-quarter net income fell to $258 million, or
26 cents a share, in the quarter, from $476 million, or 48 cents a
share, a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Industry analysts surveyed by First Call, which tracks analysts'
estimates, had estimated quarterly earnings at 33 cents a share.
</P>
<P>
   Sales rose 9 percent to $13.4 billion from $12.3 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Second-quarter earnings were down because of lower profit
margins on commercial aircraft and additional late delivery costs
due to problems with the new generation of 737 jetliners, Condit
said. Boeing also took a charge of $78 million related to the
planned termination of the MD-11 aircraft line.
</P>
<P>
   The 737 program has been especially troubled, with production
inefficiencies and parts shortages, extensive changes required
after flight testing, and lower revenue due to the mix of models
being delivered, Condit said.
</P>
<P>
   He said Boeing has made significant headway toward correcting
the problems, but no gross profit will be recorded on the new 737
program until the production rate increase from 14 aircraft to 21
aircraft per month is achieved later this year.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing also has been caught in a fierce price war with Airbus
Industrie, the European consortium.
</P>
<P>
   As a way to cut costs, Boeing executives said in December they
would cut 12,000 jobs from the company's commercial airplane
operations and in March the company announced it would cut 8,200
jobs as a result of consolidating its plants nationwide, with most
of those reductions coming in California.
</P>
<P>
   The new employment projections announced Thursday will mean job
reductions of 3,000 to 8,000 by the end of this year, bringing
Boeing's companywide payroll to 230,000 to 235,000. By the end of
next year, Boeing's job cuts will total 18,000 to 28,000, bringing
total employment to 210,000 to 220,000.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing normally has a 4 to 5 percent attrition rate per year but
it is too early to tell how many of the job cuts will come from
attrition or layoffs.
</P>
<P>
   For the first six months of 1998, Boeing had net earnings of
$308 million or 31 cents a share on sales of $26.3 billion,
compared with profits of $1 billion or $1.03 a share on sales of
$22.7 billion a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing President Harry Stonecipher said the company is dedicated
to ``meeting or beating'' its newly outlined financial goals.
</P>
<P>
   ``As I've said before, don't bet against The Boeing Co. It's a
bad bet.''

ALLY OR FOE? A COMPLAINT ON MICROSOFT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Utah, N.J.)  (th) 
 By STEVE LOHR    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The chairman of a young, fast-growing software
company testified at a Senate hearing Thursday that Microsoft Corp.
had introduced a competing product that crippled his company's most
recent technology.
</P>
<P>
   Competitors commonly complain that Microsoft business practices
are unfair. But this complaint appears particularly intriguing
because it comes from a company with close ties to Microsoft _ and
one that is engaged in a promising niche of the Internet software
market in which the government is investigating Microsoft tactics.
</P>
<P>
   The complaint was made by Robert Glaser, a former Microsoft
executive. Microsoft holds a 10 percent stake in his Seattle
company, Real Networks Inc., and licenses Real Networks technology.
After his appearance before the Senate Judiciary Committee, Glaser
said, ``I loved my 10 years at Microsoft and, even after today, I
think I have friends there.''
</P>
<P>
   Glaser's company is the leader in the emerging field of
so-called streaming software, which is used for sending recorded
voice and television-style video over the Internet and receiving
such multimedia programming on personal computers.
</P>
<P>
   Glaser's appearance before the committee included a computer
demonstration of how the latest version of Microsoft's software for
receiving streaming media, Windows Media Player, cannot play
Internet multimedia programming that is based on the latest Real
Networks technology.
</P>
<P>
   Glaser also read excerpts from an e-mail exchange with Bill
Gates, Microsoft's chairman, starting on July 6. Glaser said he
first became concerned about the problem caused by Microsoft's new
program, and the potential effect on his company, in May.
</P>
<P>
   By July, Glaser said, he was growing increasingly alarmed. Sen.
Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, had
been in touch with him about testifying in Washington, and Glaser
sent Gates an e-mail saying that he might go. In his testimony,
Glaser suggested that the communication with his old boss was a
final effort to settle his dispute instead of voicing it publicly.
</P>
<P>
   According to Glaser's account, Gates seemed in no mood to reach
an accommodation. Glaser said that Gates had said he was ``not very
familiar with our business relationship'' and later added that he
found it ``interesting'' that Glaser felt he had no choice but to
go to Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Gates closed his last e-mail to Glaser with what seemed to its
recipient a chilly dismissal. ``While you're in Washington, I
suggest you visit the National Gallery and the Smithsonian,'' Gates
wrote, according to Glaser.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft vigorously denies Glaser's version of the recent
conflict between the two companies. Microsoft officials say the
software breakdown that seemed to be so convincingly shown by
Glaser's computer demonstration in the Senate hearing room applies
only to a test, or beta, version of Real Networks' software that
was posted on its Web site for downloading only a week or so ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``This smoking gun turns out to be a water pistol,'' said Mark
Murray, a Microsoft spokesman. ``That demonstration was something
of a misleading stunt.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Microsoft, Glaser was mainly using his Senate
appearance as a negotiating ploy. And Microsoft was able to present
that view forcefully before the committee, thanks to its allies in
the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   At the hearing, Sen. Robert Torricelli, D-N.J., introduced an
affidavit of Paul Maritz, a group vice president at Microsoft. The
affidavit said Glaser called Maritz on Wednesday afternoon and said
that he was prepared to ``negotiate all night if that's what it
takes'' to come to terms with Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   The Maritz affidavit added, ``Mr. Glaser said that if the
negotiations he proposed for the night of July 22 resulted in an
agreement between the two companies, he would not testify the next
day before the Senate Judiciary Committee.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview after the hearing, Glaser said his call to
Maritz was merely a courtesy call. At the time, Glaser said, he was
in Washington and on his way to speak to Hatch before appearing
Thursday. The Maritz affidavit, Glaser said, ``is simply not
true.'' ``I was locked, loaded and ready to testify,'' Glaser said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The committee hearing comes prior to a trial of the Justice
Department's antitrust case against Microsoft, which is scheduled
to begin on Sept. 8 in U.S. District Court in Washington. The
government contends that the company is unfairly using its
near-monopoly of the market for desktop personal computer software
to dominate the new market for Internet software.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft executives characterized Glaser's allegation as an
inexplicably overwrought reaction. ``We are still willing to have
our engineers sit down with the engineers of Real Networks and work
these problems out,'' said Murray, the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Still, agreement among the engineers might be difficult as well.
Wednesday night, after six hours of software testing by its
programmers, Microsoft had concluded that the problem was with Real
Networks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a bug in their program, not ours,'' said Yusuf Mehdi, an
executive. &QL;

<P>
   One day after resigning as the president of the San Francisco
49ers, Carmen Policy emerged as chief executive of a new group led
by the billionaire banker Al Lerner that is seeking to buy the new
Cleveland Browns franchise.
</P>
<P>
   Lerner, a former 5 percent owner of the former Browns, said
Policy would get 10 percent of the team if his group was chosen by
the National Football League.
</P>
<P>
   Lerner changed his mind about not pursuing the Browns after
talking to Policy for 15 hours on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The probability of doing it right with Carmen is higher than
doing it without him,'' said Lerner, who grew up in Brooklyn and
Queens and has lived in Cleveland for 39 years, during a telephone
interview.
</P>
<P>
   Lerner's group was endorsed by Mayor Michael White of Cleveland,
who bore no rancor for Lerner's support of Modell's move of the old
Browns to Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   ``I recognized the depth of his problem,'' Lerner said.
</P>
<P>
   Policy said he did not know if his split with Eddie DeBartolo,
whose family owns the 49ers, would mend.
</P>
<P>
   ``A relationship broke down between close friends who headed
down different paths, and acquired new friends,'' Policy said. &QL;

SPORTS COLUMN: TIPTOEING RIGHT INTO A MAYBE JOB 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   One thing ascertained about Tim Floyd, the new head coach of the
Chicago Bulls, maybe, is that he improves with time, maybe. Even 10
minutes' time.
</P>
<P>
   After being introduced by the Bulls' owner, Jerry Reinsdorf, at
a news conference Thursday in Chicago as the Director of Basketball
Operations if Retired Coach Phil Jackson Decides to Return and New
Head Coach if Jackson Opts to Remain Self-Dispatched, Floyd thanked
Reinsdorf and said, ``I had always been led to believe that Jerry
Krause is the owner of the Bulls.''
</P>
<P>
   Floyd meant this as a kind of light remark, a jest, a quip, a
sally, something to evoke a little risibility among the throng of
ink-stained print and carefully coifed electronic reporters. They
weren't buying, however.
</P>
<P>
   For it is widely viewed that Krause is the core of the Bulls'
maelstrom, despite having been the aggressive general manager _
though a frequently bumbling public relations impressario _ of six
National Basketball Association championship teams in eight
seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Floyd, who left his job as coach of Iowa State, had been
vigorously courted by Krause. The two are fishing buddies.
</P>
<P>
   At the conclusion of Floyd's remarks, which included verbal bows
to Jackson, Michael Jordan, the Bulls generally as well as to
family, former coaches, athletic directors and players, he said,
``I have two more things to add: I am not Jerry Krause's boy, and
don't call what Jerry Krause does fishing, either.''
</P>
<P>
   While neither Chaplinesque nor Groucho Marxian, the last was
funny enough to demonstrate a capacity to grow, at least in
relation to his hook-inspiring start.
</P>
<P>
   And rumors of his hiring were met with a tossing of verbal
tomatoes, given that Jordan has said that he has ``nothing
against'' Floyd, whom he disparagingly calls ``Pink,'' after the
rock group, ``but I don't want to start over with a young coach, a
college coach and someone who doesn't know the way I play the game
of basketball.'' The latter comes as a mind-boggler for who doesn't
know how M.J. cavorts on the court.
</P>
<P>
   And the Bulls' answer to a rocket scientist, Dennis Rodman, has
added that the hiring of Floyd as coach would be ``a joke.''
</P>
<P>
   If in fact the 44-year-old Floyd becomes the coach _ and Jackson
has made no known attempt to retire from having retired _ he
appears a plausible choice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Krause has hired two other coaches who never had NBA
head-coaching experience, Doug Collins and Phil Jackson,'' said
John Nash, general manager of the Nets, who have been successful
the last two seasons under John Calipari, who, like Floyd, never
before had NBA experience as a coach or a player.
</P>
<P>
   ``So Krause is two for two, that's a pretty good record,'' Nash
said. Many coaches with no previous NBA experience succeeded as
coaches in the league, Nash added, and he named three: Jack Ramsay,
Dick Motta and John MacLeod.
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes ability to motivate people and to be technically
prepared,'' he said. ``There is an adjustment from college to pro,
but it's not that great. To me, bright people can transcend those
problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Jordan has waffled before. He retired from hoops, he
returned. He said he would never play for any other coach but
Jackson, and then said he was ``keeping my options open.''
</P>
<P>
   Many believe the return of Scottie Pippen is more important to
him. Pippen, recuperating from surgery earlier last season, said he
would never play for the Bulls again. And, lo and behold, did. Then
he said he would never come back with them next season, and later
said he might.
</P>
<P>
   Reinsdorf, seeking to plug a hole of fan discontent should
Jordan retire, said he wished to bring back all the people who won
Title No. 6 last season, including Jackson, who told me that he was
leaving on his own volition and that his relationship with Krause,
while poor, was not the deciding factor. So it was logical for the
owner to seek another coach if Jackson remains in Montana, or
Turkey.
</P>
<P>
   Floyd, meanwhile, said he would happily step aside and work hard
as the head of the vague new basketball operations should Jackson
return. Floyd also suggested that if he were the coach, Tex Winters
and Frank Hamblen, significant assistant coaches, would be
retained, which should bolster the comfort level of Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   Floyd has had a superb 12-year college coaching career at three
universities, with 243 victories and 130 losses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Give me a chance,'' Floyd said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Under the circumstances, this is not an unreasonable request. &QL;

MICROSOFT DESCRIBES A SUCCESSFUL YEAR AND TALKS OF MORE 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By JOHN MARKOFF    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Confident Microsoft executives Thursday outlined for
industry analysts a string of successes suggesting momentum
throughout the computer industry in markets as diverse as home
computers, business desktop machines, engineering work stations and
the giant computers that connect entire corporations and serve up
World Wide Web sites on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   To maintain this momentum, the company said it planned to
increase research and development spending to $3 billion a year
from $2.5 billion in the fiscal year that ended on June 30, and to
pump almost $200 million a year more into technical and customer
support.
</P>
<P>
   As Microsoft officials here were laying out some of the most
impressive results recorded by a major American corporation this
year, in Washington the Senate Judiciary Committee was hearing
complaints from executives of several competing software companies
that Microsoft uses predatory marketing practices to squelch
competition.
</P>
<P>
   Among those testifying was Robert Glaser, a former Microsoft
employee who is now chairman of Real Networks, a Seattle-based
maker of software that enables users to receive live audio and
video on their Web browsers.
</P>
<P>
   Glaser told senators that Microsoft had developed a new version
of its media player for the Windows 98 operating system that
undermines his software.
</P>
<P>
   A Microsoft lawyer, Brad Smith, said any problem Glaser had
encountered was unintended, adding that ``we'll keep working with
them'' to resolve it.
</P>
<P>
   However, at a time when the company's business practices are
under attack by the Justice Department, several congressional
committees and 20 states and the District of Columbia, and under
investigation by European governments, Microsoft executives gave no
indication of abandoning the aggressive strategies that have made
it one of the world's most successful and feared corporations.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, while citing increasing market share against its
strongest rivals, including Sun Microsystems, Novell and Oracle in
applications as diverse as operating systems, data bases and
Internet commerce software, the company sought to play down any
possibility that the Justice Department's antitrust suit would have
a negative effect on its profit.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Jeff Raikes, its sales chief, suggested that Justice
Department investigators had misinterpreted a corporate sense of
humor as a strategic intention to eradicate competition.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   To demonstrate this corporate humor, Raikes played a music video
that the company had produced to motivate its sales force. In the
video, a spoof on the movie ``Men In Black,'' Raikes plays the role
of a rap singer wearing wrap-around dark glasses.
</P>
<P>
   His lyrics include, ``We're the first, last and best line of
defense against the worst scum in the industry,'' and, referring to
Lawrence Ellison, the chairman of Oracle, ``Ellison is a loser.''
</P>
<P>
   In particular, Microsoft officials expressed satisfaction with
advances in their share of several markets and with sales of
Windows 98, which they said was on track to match the first three
months' sales of Windows 95, the best-selling software ever.
</P>
<P>
   ``That has surprised a lot of people, including myself to some
extent,'' Raikes said.
</P>
<P>
   There were other areas where the company acknowledged it had
made less progress than it expected. Novell had proved to be a
tougher competitor than was expected in the network service market.
</P>
<P>
   But Microsoft executives asserted that they had taken five to
eight percentage points of market share away from Novell in the
last year, and Raikes said he would be disappointed if Microsoft's
market share did not grow an equal amount next year.
</P>
<P>
   As he does every year, Microsoft's chief financial officer
predicted that the company's growth would decline substantially in
the coming year because many of its products are mature and are
reaching the saturation point in the market. He also expressed fear
about the Asian troubles, adding, ``In fact, there is evidence it's
getting worse.''
</P>
<P>
   Each year Microsoft appears to zero in on one company for
attack, and analysts who attended Thursday's meeting said the next
focus would be on the corporate data base business that Oracle now
dominates.
</P>
<P>
   Ellison was in Washington on Thursday, testifying against
Microsoft's business practices. &QL;

THE PHANTOM HAS LANDED IN FORT WORTH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   By PERRY STEWART &QC;
</P>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ The chandelier has landed.
</P>
<P>
   Heralded by an avalanche of publicity, frantic scrambles for
tickets and a scenery and equipment load-in of D-Day dimensions,
the national touring production of ``The Phantom of the Opera''
opened Wednesday night in the Nancy Lee and Perry R. Bass
Performance Hall.
</P>
<P>
   This is the moon landing of Fort Worth entertainment events.
Wednesday's show was technically termed a preview, one of three,
with Friday's performance being the official opening.
</P>
<P>
   Fiddlesticks. Try telling the folks who filled the hall
Wednesday that they weren't bona fide first-nighters. When a show
takes on the celebrity of ``Phantom,'' the night it arrives in your
town is the opening.
</P>
<P>
   The cast of Andrew Lloyd Webber's megahit musical had a dress
rehearsal Wednesday afternoon, and it obviously acquainted them
with the Bass hall. The first public performance went off with no
hitches _ the famous chandelier ``crashing'' on cue. It wasn't the
frightening spectacle that first-time ``Phantom'' viewers probably
expected. But it never is.
</P>
<P>
   (A scarier effect comes earlier, when the Phantom spies on
Christine and Raoul from a statuary high above the Paris Opera
House.)
</P>
<P>
   The Lloyd Webber score sounds good in the Bass hall, and the
singers sound even better. Brad Little is a talent of impressive
range, both as singer and actor. As the hideously deformed figure
who haunts the Paris Opera House, Little succeeds in evoking fright
and compassion. He builds his signature song, ``The Music of the
Night,'' from delicate whisper to powerful crescendo and brings
similar joy with ``All I Ask of You.''
</P>
<P>
   To the role of Christine, the beautiful young soprano coached
and mesmerized by the Phantom, Amy Jo Arrington brings winsome
charm, a saucy sense of comedy and a lovely coloratura. She and
Little team winningly on ``I Remember'' and ``Stranger Than You
Dreamt It'' and powerfully (with Jason Pebworth) on ``Wandering
Child.''
</P>
<P>
   Pebworth has the not-altogether heroic role of Raoul, the
spoiled young viscount who courts Christine.
</P>
<P>
   Director Harold Prince's unflagging pace is maintained in this
touring edition, and Maria Bjornson's sets and costumes add the
perfect mixture of brilliance and excess.
</P>
<P>
   The company as a whole is superior, as evidenced by the Act II
opener, ``Masquerade,'' a number that showcases every aspect of
musical theater as well as the 19th century ambience of the hall.
</P>
<P>
   This show has great fun spoofing the ornate aspects of grand
opera, particularly in backstage and rehearsal exchanges. Julie
Schmidt, as the resident diva unseated by Christine, is a key
player in those moments.
</P>
<P>
   Saluting Schmidt on ``Prima Donna'' are Pebworth, Richard
Reardon, Betina Hershey and David Cryer. Yes, this is the same
David Cryer who was the firebrand Rutledge in ``1776.'' The voice
is still there, and Cryer demonstrates comic savvy as the
beleaguered opera house manager.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, there is fine work from Jennine Jones as a ballet
mistress suggestive of the housekeeper in ``Rebecca,'' Steven
Stein-Grainger as an egotistic tenor and Stephen Len White as opera
``buffo'' archtype.

 Pacific Exchange May Merge   By Peter Sinton  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
In another merger that could weaken San Francisco's image as the
West Coast's financial capital, the directors of the Pacific
Exchange announced an agreement yesterday to join forces with the
Chicago Board Options Exchange.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Pacific Exchange would keep its options trading floor in San
Francisco and move ahead with plans to build a major new trading
facility on Folsom Street.
</P>
<P>
   The original business of the Pacific _ trading stocks _ would be
sold to another exchange or spun off as an independent organization
within 18 months. The Pacific has stock trading floors in Los
Angeles and San Francisco. The CBOE does not trade stocks, only
options. An option contract gives the holder the right to buy or
sell a company's stock at a certain price by a certain date.
</P>
<P>
   Completion of the deal is not certain, because two-thirds of the
Pacific Exchange's 552 members must approve it. And, yesterday,
many were alarmed because the Pacific could lose more than 100
stock options _ including many of its hottest contracts _ to the
CBOE.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; That's because about 160 of the Pacific's 800-plus stock
options are also traded on the CBOE, and it looks like dual-listed
options will be traded on the floor where they have the greatest
market share.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fear is that we will lose 130 issues, including Cisco
Systems, America Online, Amazon.com and Netscape,'' said James
Burleson, a market maker for Joseph D. Heard and also chairman of
the Pacific Exchange's nominating committee. ``This would devastate
my business. I trade Cisco and Read-Rite among other
multiple-listed issues and could lose two-thirds of my
livelihood.''
</P>
<P>
   As the dominant U.S. options exchange with a nearly 50 percent
market share, the CBOE had more clout in the negotiations than the
No. 3-ranked Pacific Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   CBOE Chairman and Chief Executive William Brodsky left no doubt
yesterday that his organization will be ``the successor entity'' if
the deal goes through.
</P>
<P>
   Although no name has been chosen yet for the combined exchange,
the headquarters would be in Chicago and its top two officers would
be Brodsky and CBOE President Charles Henry. Pacific Exchange CEO
Robert Greber declined to say what he would do after a merger.
</P>
<P>
   The San Francisco exchange was the first center of trading for
industrial stocks in the West. It was founded in 1882, a time when
the California economy was starting to diversify from its gold and
silver-mining roots. By providing a market for their stocks, it
helped companies like Pacific Gas &AMP; Electric and Wells Fargo raise
capital and become the giants they are today.
</P>
<P>
   Neither exchange could say how many jobs the merger might cost
the city, which is home to nearly 400 Pacific employees and as many
as 1,900 employees of member firms.
</P>
<P>
   The merged entity would trade options on more than 1,700 stocks,
accounting for 65 percent of all trading of U.S. securities
options.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Chicago exchange does nearly three times as much
business and has nearly three times as many members as the Pacific,
it will likely control the new board of directors.
</P>
<P>
   The two exchanges announced that they were in merger discussions
last week. Like brokerage firms and banks, exchanges are merging to
gain market share, cut costs and become more competitive in the
global marketplace. BankAmerica recently agreed to merge with
NationsBank of Charlotte, N.C., costing San Francisco the
headquarters of another long-standing financial institution.
</P>
<P>
   The CBOE reportedly spends about $60 million a year on
technology, and the Pacific spends about $20 million. The plan is
to save about $80 million in technology investments over the next
five or six years. About 80 percent of options trades on the CBOE
are handled electronically compared to only about 20 percent at the
Pacific, according to Pacific Exchange Vice Chairman Rob Kovell.
</P>
<P>
   ``The combination will result in considerable economies of
scale, particularly in the development of costly new trading
systems,'' said Brodsky.
</P>
<P>
   Some Pacific market makers applauded the deal. ``It will give us
a lot of CBOE technology,'' said Peter Napoli, a market maker with
Assets Mondial.
</P>
<P>
   But others traders wonder why the deal was necessary since the
exchange has recorded record profits for three years and trading
volume has been increasing at about 40 percent per year.
</P>
<P>
   Burleson is worried about how new stock options will be
allocated to the two trading floors. ``Since the committee that
decides future allocations of new options will be skewed in favor
of the CBOE because they have more members, I fear our future
growth will be stunted.''
</P>
<P>
   Pacific Exchange spokesman Dale Carlson acknowledged that some
traders could be hurt but said that no decisions have been made on
how dual-listed options and new option issues would be allocated.
And even if the San Francisco options trading floor lost
dual-listed issues which are traded more heavily in Chicago, the
Pacific's average daily options volume would dip only 4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Pacific Exchange officials met with trading specialists and
members yesterday afternoon in San Francisco and Los Angeles and
tried to assure them that the deal would be good for them. But not
everyone was convinced.
</P>
<P>
   One thorny issue is what to do with the equities trading floors
in San Francisco and Los Angeles. About a quarter of Pacific
members trade stocks, not options.
</P>
<P>
   ``They said that they would try to work out a solution to keep
us a stand-alone equity exchange or merge us with another regional
exchange such as the Boston, Cincinnati or NASD,'' said Dennis
LoPresti, senior vice president of Wedbush Morgan Securities in Los
Angeles. ``But I don't want the CBOE determining our destiny. I and
a lot of others would like a commitment to keep us independent.''
</P>
<P>
   Government officials said they don't think the merger will hurt
the city.
</P>
<P>
   ``This appears to be good for both San Francisco and Chicago,''
said Kandace Bender, spokeswoman for Mayor Willie Brown. ``The deal
allows both exchanges to become stronger and supports a new trading
facility South of Market.'' City Supervisor Mark Leno added,
``Everything I've heard is encouraging.''

AS MISHAP'S IMPACT DEEPENS, COMPENSATION BID IS SPURNED 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also NY-COLLAPSE-RESTAURANT and other sidebars to come) 
(bl) 
 By DAVID W. CHEN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ As the long-term costs of the Times Square
construction site collapse became a sobering reality _ with at
least 600 people left homeless and Broadway productions and local
businesses shut down indefinitely _ Mayor Rudolph Giuliani on
Thursday dismissed as inadequate a $50,000 compensation offer made
by the owner and builder of the troubled Conde Nast building.
</P>
<P>
   The offer came as personal tales of dislocation and disruption
took on a more urgent, more stressful tone, particularly the plight
of 300 residents forced from their apartment building on 44th
Street. At the same time, pressure mounted to get the area back to
normal as quickly as possible, as businesses complained that they
were hemorrhaging money.
</P>
<P>
   Facing increasing demands that compensation be paid out quickly,
the developer of the Conde Nast building, the Durst Organization,
and the construction manager, Tishman Construction Corp., offered
$50,000 to assist those displaced by the collapse of the elevator
tower at the building site. But in announcing that the offer had
been made, Giuliani all but derided that sum as measly.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's certainly inadequate,'' a stern-looking Giuliani said.
``They could offer a lot more than that, because there's going to
be a lot more involved in the displacement that's taken place.''
</P>
<P>
   Several hours after the mayor's news conference, Tishman
released a statement suggesting that there had been a
misunderstanding. The $50,000, the statement said, is earmarked for
those businesses and residents requiring immediate assistance, like
food and medicine.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, ``sufficient funds will be made available to
adequately provide for all those who have been displaced or
suffered hardships,'' the statement said.
</P>
<P>
   The confusion seemed to befit a day when uncertainty continued
to swirl around the accident, the cleanup and the consequences of
what Buildings Commissioner Gaston Silva has described as ``the
most serious and dramatic construction failure of this decade.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, city officials are clinging to their goal of wrapping
the Conde Nast building on 43rd Street near Broadway with a
reinforced black nylon netting by late Friday or Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Once the netting is in place, workers can begin to dismantle the
twisted remains of the damaged scaffolding tower. There are also
several canisters of oxygen on the tower that need to be removed.
Then, Seventh Avenue, Broadway and the Avenue of the Americas can
be reopened to vehicular and pedestrian traffic, perhaps as soon as
Saturday. And residents on West 44th Street and other closed
streets who have been left homeless for the last three days can
return to their apartments.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   One resident of 123 W. 44th St., Dennis van Golbereinge, a chef
at the Waldorf-Astoria, left his apartment at 8 a.m. Tuesday for a
run in Central Park. He has not been able to return, and because he
only has his running clothes, he cannot get access to his bank
account because he has no identification.
</P>
<P>
   His effective eviction also posed professional problems. ``My
laptop is my life,'' said van Golbereinge. ``I have 20 years of
recipes in there.''
</P>
<P>
   But 43rd Street between the Avenue of the Americas and Broadway,
city officials acknowledged, is a different matter, leaving the
fate of 275 people forced from the Woodstock Hotel in doubt
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be five days to a week after everything else is
open'' on 43rd Street, Silva said. ``And even then, it may not be
open' he added. ``We may end up putting sidewalk sheds to allow
pedestrians. We may open up one-half to pedestrian traffic on just
the north side. It's just a fluid situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Silva said that there were no more clues Thursday about what
might have caused Tuesday's accident, in which a temporary elevator
collapsed and rained tons of steel onto the streets below, killing
an 85-year-old woman and forcing the closing of a large swath of
midtown Manhattan. For now, he said, there are three leading
theories: that a 10-foot section of the 700-foot scaffolding
collapsed; that bolts or nuts were missing from the scaffolding and
tower assembly, and that a crane at the top of the building slammed
into the elevator tower.
</P>
<P>
   As for those who were displaced, there was a modicum of
encouraging news Thursday. Richard Kielar, senior vice president of
Tishman Realty &AMP; Construction Co., said that a walk-in emergency
assistance center would be opened Friday morning at the Hippodrome
building, 1120 Avenue of the Americas.
</P>
<P>
   For a few hours Thursday afternoon, emergency personnel allowed
some residents to return quickly to their apartments on West 43rd
Street between Fifth Avenue and the Avenue of the Americas and
retrieve some items. But after construction workers detected a
shift in the Conde Nast building at about 7:30 p.m., that glimmer
of hope was doused.

 NEW YORK: was doused.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   And there were other tales of lives that had been thrown out of
loop.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Wingate, a spokesman for the American Red Cross in
Greater New York said an elderly diabetic man showed up at a hotel
where the Red Cross is providing shelter and said he had been
wandering the streets for a couple of days.
</P>
<P>
   Dale Badway, a maitre d' at Sam's Restaurant in Times Square who
is also an actor and a model, said he had been evacuated so quickly
from his apartment at 123 W. 44th St. that he left his
air-conditioning on and didn't take anything other than a credit
card and a cellular phone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have resumes, head shots, my book _ emotionally I'm
starting to feel the fatigue of being homeless,'' he said. ``I'm
living out of a knapsack with dirty underwear and dirty socks.''
</P>
<P>
   Rhonda Muziani, an actress who also works at the Rainbow Room,
had been waiting for two sizable checks that she had counted on to
help pay her rent at 123 W. 44th St. But the U.S. Postal Service is
barred from delivering mail to the affected area.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to run around looking for the truck,'' she said. (Good
news, bad news: the Postal Service said Thursday that affected
customers can pick up their mail at the post office at 340 W. 42nd
St. _ but ID is required.)
</P>
<P>
   The circus-like atmosphere has extended beyond the thought of
people chasing mail delivery trucks or the sight of Times Square
sans automobiles. Several pets remained stuck in some buildings
Thursday, and that prompted a vigorous protest from animal-rights
organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Even those who work in the area and have been unable to return
to their offices said the novelty of the accident had worn off.
</P>
<P>
   ``On Tuesday when it happened, everyone was like, `Whew! Snow
day! Vacation! Long weekend!''' said Meg D'Incecco, national media
manager for Edelman Public Relations Worldwide, whose offices are
at 1500 Broadway.``But it's become more of a pain than an
adventure.''

 A New Chapter in the Colorful History of Pacific Exchange   By Carol Emert  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
The Pacific Exchange bucked 116 years of bull and bear markets and
competition with larger exchanges before agreeing yesterday to
merge with the Chicago Board Options Exchange.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Pacific Exchange, which trades hundreds of millions of
dollars worth of stocks and options each day, began as a modest
attempt by 19 local brokers to impose order on the booming but
infantile market for Western industrial stocks in the late 1800s.
</P>
<P>
   California's economy was beginning to diversify from its
gold-mining roots, and the capitalists of the day needed a
centralized spot to buy and sell securities.
</P>
<P>
   On Sept. 18, 1882, a group of enterprising brokers met in the
basement of Wohl &AMP; Pollitz at 403 California St. and formed the
Local Security Board. Within a month, the organization underwent
the first of many name and location changes and was redubbed the
San Francisco Stock and Bond Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Trading began the day after the founding, with the stock of a
dozen companies changing hands. The exchange's members paid $7.50 a
month for the privilege of shouting bids from either side of a room
at 312 California St.
</P>
<P>
   The trading was mediated by a caller sitting in the middle of
the room, and disputed bids were put to a vote by members. Winners
tended to be the brokers with the most friends present. Sessions,
sometimes lasting only 15 minutes, were held at 11 a.m. and 2 p.m.
weekdays and 2 p.m. on Saturdays.
</P>
<P>
   The exchange's charter members included Carl and Gustav Sutro of
Sutro &AMP; Co., a San Francisco investment firm that is still in
business today.
</P>
<P>
   In its first year of operation, the San Francisco Stock and Bond
Exchange traded $9.5 million in stocks, including Hawaiian
Commercial and Sugar Co.; Safety Nitro Powder, which made dynamite
for gold mining; and public utilities such as San Francisco Gas and
Electric.
</P>
<P>
   The dozen stocks traded more than quintupled during the
exchange's first year to 62. Today, the Pacific Exchange trades
2,700 stocks in various industries and 800 options, primarily on
technology companies.
</P>
<P>
   In April of 1906, the exchange closed for the first time since
its founding because of the earthquake and fire that hit San
Francisco. Proving that you can't keep capitalism down, members
resumed trading in the basement of one member's home, sitting on
crates and observing the proceedings by candle light.
</P>
<P>
   Competition with other exchanges began in earnest in 1925, when
Western Union installed ticker tape to connect the San Francisco
exchange to the New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the exchange wasn't all work and no play. The San
Francisco Stock Exchange Institute was founded as the
``educational, social and athletic auxiliary to the stock
exchange,'' according to a Chronicle account of the time.
</P>
<P>
   In 1925, the Institute staged a musical comedy in the Columbia
Theater featuring ``sixteen girls, all beautiful, flanked by a
snappy male chorus chosen from the younger members of the
organization,'' The Chronicle reported. The dancers' ``tricky
steps'' were guaranteed to ``intrigue the most blase of front row
fans,'' the account promised.
</P>
<P>
   In 1926, the exchange replaced its ``open outcry'' trading
system with specialists _ individuals who oversee the trading of
particular stocks. In 1928, a seat on the Exchange went for a
shocking $250,000.
</P>
<P>
   But by early 1929, concerns about a lack of liquidity and
competition with East Coast markets were beginning to grow.
</P>
<P>
   Stock market officials touted the lack of a state tax, which
made trading cheaper here than on the New York Stock Exchange. They
also hoped that the expertise of San Francisco specialists in local
companies would encourage continued trading of those Western
companies.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the stock market crash of October 1929, the exchange
proceeded with plans to move to its current headquarters on Pine
and Sansome streets in early 1930. The exchange paid $2.5 million
to build a new trading floor behind the classical facade of the
former U.S. Sub-Treasury Building.
</P>
<P>
   During World War II, women were allowed for the first time to
work on the trading floor as ``markers,'' but the exchange didn't
admit its first woman member until 1969, when Venita Van Caspel
joined.
</P>
<P>
   To cut costs and help California exchanges remain competitive,
the San Francisco Exchange in 1957 merged with its bitter rival,
the Los Angeles Exchange, to create the Pacific Coast Stock
Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   The outlook for the new exchange seemed rosy to then-chairman
William Agnew. He told the Argonaut newspaper in 1957 that the
merged organization ``will continue to progress with this
magnificent region, for it is the securities industry's Exchange of
Destiny _ destined to grow and serve the entire Pacific coast.''
</P>
<P>
   The 1970s were a period of change and anxiety for the exchange.
Although it instituted the country's first computerized automatic
execution system, its stock business languished.
</P>
<P>
   In the mid-'70s the exchange fought off an attempted acquisition
by the New York Stock Exchange. It also blocked a move to close the
San Francisco trading floor and move all operations to Los Angeles,
where trading volume was twice as high as in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   But exchange officials also made the key decision in 1976 to
begin trading options. Earlier this decade, options exceeded stocks
as the exchange's biggest business. With the merger announced
yesterday, the exchange is expected to sell off its equities
business and concentrate solely on options.
</P>
<P>
   Trading today could hardly be more different from the 1882
California St. operations.
</P>
<P>
   All of the stock exchanges in the country now are linked so that
investors can buy and sell shares on whatever exchange offers the
best price, whether the order gets executed in New York, Chicago or
Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   The ``open outcry'' system is still in force on the options
floor of the Pacific Exchange, but for equities, it was replaced in
1926 by a system of ``specialists'' _ individuals who oversee the
trading of particular companies. Computer screens have replaced the
chalkboards where trades were recorded in the early days.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the Pacific Exchange traded 3.3 billion shares of
stock, up from 2.9 billion in 1996. It also moved 46.7 million
options contracts, up from 34 million the prior year. Each options
contract gives investors the right to buy or sell 100 shares of
stock.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, a Pacific Exchange membership sold for a record
$380,000, though that number has fallen somewhat this year.

   Series history: Atlanta trails the all-time series 184-208 but
is 12-6 at Three Rivers
</P>
<P>
   the past four years.
</P>
<P>
   Past meetings: The Braves are 5-1 against the Pirates in 1998;
all of those games were played in a 10-day period in April.Quickly:
The Pirates entered Thursday night's play having won six of
eight... The Pirates cannot blame their pitching staff for being
under .500 since June 6. The team ERA is 3.55, third only to the
Braves and New York in the National League. They have been
vulnerable late in the game. Of their 54 losses, 10 came after they
led in the seventh. ... The bigger problem has been run production.
The Pirates are averaging 3.93 runs a game this year, down from
4.47 last year. ... Still, they have two of the most difficult outs
in the league. Jason Kendall took a .335 average into Thursday
night, second in the NL, and with one strikeout every 13 at-bats,
ranks sixth as the toughest man to strike out. Tony Womack has not
grounded into a double play in 419 at-bats, the longest streak in
the league. He was tied with Oakland's Rickey Henderson with a
major league-high 39 stolen bases. ... Peters, tonight's starter,
has pitched beyond the fifth inning in just two of his nine starts,
but is coming off his best performance of the season, beating
Montreal 6-1 last Sunday (seven innings, five hits, one run, five
strikeouts). ... On the DL: RHP Marc Wilkins (strained right
rotator cuff), LHP Jeff Tabaka (fractured jaw) and RHP Jose Silva
(fractured right wrist).
</P>
<P>
   Who's hot: Young's 20 homers have already established a career
high. He entered the year with just 39 career homers in 418 games.
Right fielder Jose Guillen is tied with Andruw Jones and
Philadelphia's Doug Glanville and Bobby Abreu for the outfield
assist lead with 11.
</P>
<P>
   Who's not: Mark Smith, a career .259 hitter who had nine homers
last year in just 193 at-bats, is down to .216 with just two homers
in 97 at-bats. Rookie reliever Javier Martinez has allowed 26 hits
with 23 walks in just 24 1/3 innings.

 &HT;    Computer says Galarraga can top Maris mark
 &HT;    By Bill Hendrick
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- Don't give up on Andres Galarraga breaking Roger
Maris' home run record _ he's got a 50-50 chance. And unless Mark
McGwire of the St. Louis Cardinals gets struck by lightning, he's
almost a cinch to grab the single-season homer title.
</P>
<P>
   Those aren't the predictions of Las Vegas bookies, but of a
physicist at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland. He's
crunched thousands of numbers in his computer, which figures that
McGwire, who has 43 homers, has a 97 percent chance of hitting 62
or more.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Robert Brown's computer also predicts that Seattle's Ken
Griffey Jr., who has 40 homers, has a 75 percent chance of topping
Maris' record, set in 1961. And it says there's a 99 percent chance
that either McGwire or Griffey will break the record.
</P>
<P>
   So what do computers know? It's true, numbers can lie, but
trends seldom do, Brown said Thursday. His predictions are based on
assumptions based on previous performances, but also that McGwire
won't miss more than a week of games due to injury or stress, and
that Griffey won't miss more than one. He also figures in how the
two sluggers have done so far against the teams they'll play again,
and how they've done against pitchers they're likely to see.
</P>
<P>
   The Cubs' Sammy Sosa, Brown says, has only about a 50 percent
chance of beating Maris, even though he has the same number of
homers as Griffey.
</P>
<P>
   Predictions are based on such variables as average homers per
time at bat, and rate of hits per game. Among other things, the
scientist looked at each player's propensity for injuries, illness
and for handling stress. He also says McGwire has a 92 percent
chance of breaking Babe Ruth's mark of 60 homers in 154 games.

 &HT;    Outbreak traced to beef
 &HT;    By Diane Lore
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- Beef served last spring in Madison County schools is
emerging as the likely source of the state's largest E. coli
outbreak that infected more than two-dozen children at White Water
park.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point we suspect the beef,'' said Dr. Paul Blake,
epidemiologist for the state Division of Public Health. ``It's not
definitive, but there is an indication of a strong link.''
</P>
<P>
   Health investigators have known about the genetic match between
the hamburger and White Water for weeks, but have refused to make a
firm connection because the particular strain common to the beef
and White Water cases has appeared elsewhere in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   That has angered members of Safe Tables Our Priority, or STOP,
who said public health officials should have worked harder to find
a link sooner and communicated more with parents about the possible
connection.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've given them a false sense of security,'' by saying
pools are safe and not linking the outbreak to beef, said Nancy
Donley of Chicago. Donley worries that public health officials are
far more interested in protecting a meat manufacturer or a theme
park than alerting the public to a health hazard.
</P>
<P>
   Blake said he was surprised by the criticism. State health
officials learned of the E. coli cases on June 19, a Friday, and
held a press conference the following Tuesday. ``We've been very
proud of the fact that we were able to move so quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   Blake said public health officials believed serious E. coli
cases linked to beef eaten by kids in April and May in Madison
County had been limited to one child. Officials were not overly
concerned because the contamination was discovered and the meat was
recalled quickly by the manufacturer, Bauer Meat Co. of Ocala, Fla.
A Danielsville boy with diabetes and other health problems was
hospitalized in connection with the beef.
</P>
<P>
   And, Blake said, public health workers checked absentee records
of school children to make sure there wasn't a ``large hidden
outbreak.'' They found nothing.
</P>
<P>
   But now health officials suspect secondary infections, those
that are passed from person to person, might have led to the
outbreak at the popular Cobb County water park. Definitely proving
that is tenuous, Blake said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Trying to do a trace back through a multiple-generation
transmission is about impossible,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In the White Water outbreak, Blake said the investigators are
still trying to determine how the park became contaminated. Health
workers recently revised questionnaires originally completed by
victims, family members and friends in an attempt to learn more
specific details. For example, health workers are now asking
parents the exact time of day when they visited the park and when
symptoms first occurred.
</P>
<P>
   They are also exploring other possible ways fecal matter could
have gotten into the pool. Previously, officials said there were
probably either fecal accidents on June 11 and June 17, each
followed by a day of residual contamination, or four days of fecal
accidents.
</P>
<P>
   But since learning more about the practices of White Water
visitors, other scenarios are possible, Blake said. Some mothers,
for example, were not using the diaper changers in bathrooms;
instead, they were changing infants on the plastic deck chairs,
leaving soiled diapers under them.
</P>
<P>
   Blake said toddlers or others could have gotten feces on their
feet from walking on a diaper and then could have rinsed the
bacteria off their feet and into the pool. There could have been
residue left on the chairs or on parents hands, he said.
</P>
<P>
   White Water, which has brought in a team of medical experts to
conduct its own investigation, would not discuss the team's
findings.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to figure out how the organism got into the pool
and how it was transmitted,'' said Dr. Eugene Gangarosa, who is
leading the team. ``But I do not feel comfortable discussing
intimate details of the investigation.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The pool is perfectly safe,'' said Gangarosa, the former
deputy director of the bacterial disease division for the CDC and a
former supervisor of Blake. ``I will have no problem taking my
grandchildren there in August when they visit.''

 Senate Backs Internet Gambling Ban   By Jon Swartz  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
All bets are off the Internet.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The U.S. Senate voted overwhelmingly yesterday to shut down the
online gambling industry, condemning it as a corrupting influence
on young Americans and a major contributor to crime.
</P>
<P>
   Senators voted 90 to 10 to ban an estimated 140 offshore Web
sites _ with names like World Sports Exchange, InterCasinos and
NetCasino _ from letting U.S. high rollers play interactive
blackjack, video poker, roulette and other casino-style games over
the World Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
   The ban is expected to sweep through the House and be signed
into law by President Clinton this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Internet gambling is unregulated, accessible by minors,
addictive, subject to abuse for fraudulent purposes like money
laundering, evasive of state gambling laws _ and already illegal at
the federal level in many cases,'' said Senator Jon Kyl, R-Ariz.,
the bill's chief author.
</P>
<P>
   Online wagers _ available 24 hours a day from the privacy of
homes and offices _ add up to an estimated $1 billion worldwide,
$600 million of it in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   If it becomes law, the gambling ban would be the most
far-reaching Internet legislation since the Communications Decency
Act of 1996. That bill, which barred indecent and ``patently
offensive'' materials on the Net, was ruled unconstitutional by the
U.S. Supreme Court last year.
</P>
<P>
   The gambling legislation _ included as an amendment to a $33.2
billion spending bill _ would force Internet service providers in
the United States to use filtering software to block customer
access to cybergambling, Kyl said.
</P>
<P>
   Internet gambling already is considered illegal under a 1961
federal law that bars interstate gambling over telephone wires.
While that has deterred U.S. operators from establishing online
betting, it has not stopped offshore companies from setting up
global online casinos in exotic locales such as the Caribbean and
Central America.
</P>
<P>
   Under Kyl's provision, gamblers face fines up to $500 and jail
terms of up to three months; individuals running gambling sites
could be imprisoned for four years and fined $20,000 or three times
the amount of bets accepted.
</P>
<P>
   However, the ban would not apply to:
</P>
<P>
   _State lotteries and off-track betting that employ
``closed-loop, subscriber-based'' computer systems unavailable to
the general public.
</P>
<P>
   _Sites for popular sports ``rotisserie'' leagues, in which
consumers pick professional athletes and bet on their statistics,
as long as fees are not used to pay off bets.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate, meanwhile, rejected Native American groups' appeal
that they be exempted from the Internet rule because their casinos
and gambling operations are sanctioned under a separate federal
law. Kyl said that would create a mammoth loophole.
</P>
<P>
   Kyl's provision has been hotly disputed for more than a year,
stuck in a political tug-of-war between opposing interest groups.
</P>
<P>
   Backers of the bill range from consumer advocate Ralph Nader and
the four major sports leagues to law-enforcement officials, the
Christian Coalition and regulated gambling operations. All of them
contend that unfettered access to gambling contributes to
bankruptcy, crime, family breakups and, in some cases, suicide.
</P>
<P>
   ``Online gambling is a predatory attack on main street America.
With a click of a mouse, you could lose your house,'' said Tom
Grey, executive director of the National Coalition Against Gambling
Expansion in Hanover, Ill. ``People are wagering, and losing _
$2,000 an evening in front of their PCs, instead of watching TV.''
</P>
<P>
   Licensed U.S. casinos, such as the Las Vegas Mirage, say they
oppose cyberwagers because they are not subject to strict controls
over ownership or fairness of the games. For example, no one makes
sure that virtual slot machines occasionally pay off.
</P>
<P>
   Other supporters of the ban agree. ``Legalized online gambling
is legalized stealing,'' Christian Coalition spokesman Arne Owens
said.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents, however, argue that the bill is toothless and will do
little to dissuade online gambling ventures.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's being proposed here is outright prohibition without any
attempt at regulation,'' said Sue Schneider, chairwoman of the
Interactive Gaming Council, a group promoting online gambling.
</P>
<P>
   Internet providers, who would bear the brunt of implementing
blocks against gambling sites, also protested the legislation. ``We
adamantly oppose the idea of turning ISPs into online traffic
cops,'' said Justin Newton, public policy director of the ISP
Consortium, a Minneapolis-based organization that represents 300
Internet service providers worldwide. ``It is technologically
impossible to track all the content that travels over our online
services.''
</P>
<P>
   Industry sources said enforcement of the legislation could be
equally troublesome.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the California attorney general's office in
Sacramento acknowledged it would be difficult to pinpoint
individuals gambling online.
</P>
<P>
   And Sebastian Sinclair, an analyst with Christiansen Cummings
Associates, a New York gambling consulting firm, said the
governments of Antigua, the Dominican Republic and other offshore
gambling hotbeds have shown no willingness to extradite individuals
to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, many in the online gambling industry said the
legislation will do little to damper the proliferation of virtual
casinos. The industry has mushroomed from a dozen companies a year
ago to about 140 today.
</P>
<P>
   ``If people want to gamble, they gamble. You can't wiretap and
monitor everyone's personal computer,'' said David Herschman, CEO
of Virtual Vegas in San Francisco, &UR;  &LR; which skirts the gambling laws
with a game-show format that rewards consumers with cash and
prizes. ``There is no way to enforce it.''

 &HT;    Reeves concerned about conditioning
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- Certain things about the Atlanta Falcons' first
practice of training camp were predictable. It was hot, and things
were ugly from time to time as players went through a 2 1/2-hour
practice Thursday afternoon in Suwanee. All 80 players were
present.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a good first day,'' coach Dan Reeves said. ``I thought
we handled the heat pretty well. We looked a little ragged on
offense, but I didn't see anything that upset me.''
</P>
<P>
   Reeves was concerned, however, that some players appeared to be
laboring more than he felt they should. During sprints, a few
players clearly struggled.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to see some guys in better condition,'' Reeves said.
``Some guys, like (tight end) O.J. Santiago, (rookie wide receiver)
Tim Dwight and (wide receiver) Terance Mathis, those guys can run
forever. But we've got some guys who need some work. We don't want
to be losing games because we're not in shape.''
</P>
<P>
   Quarterback Chris Chandler said, ``It was good. Guys were really
excited. We need to keep that going for two or three weeks.
Sometimes, that gets pretty tough.''
</P>
<P>
   On deck
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons will have two practices today, from 9 a.m. to 11:30,
and from 3 p.m. to 5:30. They like will have two practices Saturday
as well, at the same times. Practices are open to the public, at
team headquarters, at Exit 44 off Interstate 85. Tomorrow is likely
to be the only Saturday of training camp, and team officials are
encouraging fans to bring the family, enjoy interactive games
adjacent to the practice fields, and have lunch.
</P>
<P>
   Turning up the heat
</P>
<P>
   When practice started, it was 93 degrees with a relatively
modest 43 percent humidity. Wispy clouds seemed to dim the effects
of the sun, and there even was an occasional breeze. ``This is a
vacation compared to Miami,'' said rookie wide receiver Jammi
German, who played at Miami (Fla.). ``Man, sometimes you just
couldn't hardly even breathe down there.'' Still, it was hot.
Mathis said, ``I wish this practice had been in the morning.
Tomorrow, it will be more intense. This time tomorrow, I think guys
will be a lot more sore.''
</P>
<P>
   QB watch
</P>
<P>
   In a variety of settings, including passing drills, 9-on-9
scrimmages, and a limited amount of 11-on-11 scrimmages (with full
contact, but no tackling), Chandler got all the snaps with the No.
1 unit, second-year man Tony Graziani got all the snaps with the
No. 2 unit, and Steve DeBerg all the snaps with the No. 3 unit.
Each man received the same amount of snaps. Rookie free agent Brian
Brennan spent most of the afternoon working elsewhere, for example
taking snaps from centers while offensive and defensive linemen
practiced technique. DeBerg's first pass was intercepted, but
through no fault of his own. It bounced off the hands of receiver
Kevin Thornal, who was on the practice squad last year, and
linebacker Ruffin Hamilton picked it off. In 11-on-11 drills,
Graziani was intercepted by safety Marcus Wimberly, who returned it
45 yards for a touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   Boon and bust
</P>
<P>
   There were quite a few dropped passes Thursday, and play was
generally spotty, which is to be expected for the first couple
days. There were NFL officials working some of the scrimmage
situations and first-string right tackle Corey Louchiey jumped
offsides on Chandler's first call. ... Defensive line coach Bill
Kollar was, as usual, the loudest coach. Very early in a drill, he
yelled at one foursome, ``Alright, go back and do it again. We need
to get on the same (expletive) page. This isn't for fun anymore; it
all counts now. It's for real.'' ... Tailback Jamal Anderson
fumbled on the final play of the 11-on-11s, with defensive end
Lester Archambeau recovering in the backfield. . . . Weakside
linebacker Cornelius Bennett made a nice play on a swing pass to
fullback Bob Christian, running the play down from the opposite
side of the field.
</P>
<P>
   What he said
</P>
<P>
   ``I got killed today; I was getting rocked. I was sliding and
shuffling my feet all over the place. But the good thing about
looking bad the first day is that there's a lot of room for
improvement. You can only look better.'' _ Anderson.
</P>
<P>
   Did you know?
</P>
<P>
   In order to hydrate all 80 players and dozens more team
officials, the Falcons purchased 200 cases of bottled water, 300
cases of bottled juices and 100 cases of sports drink for the first
five days or so. Players take all their meals in the Falcon Inn
adjacent to the practice fields. All players stay there during
camp.
</P>
<P>
   Injury update
</P>
<P>
   All 80 players passed physicals Thursday, and there were no
serious injuries. There were, however, and few nicks and dings that
might limit players in what they can do today. Starting right guard
Gene Williams suffered a back strain. Other injuries: backup guard
Scott Adams (strained hamstring), Mathis (back spasms), reserve
defensive tackle Nathan Davis (stomach illness).
</P>
<P>
   Home cooking
</P>
<P>
   A couple of the 13 players with connections to the state of
Georgia stood out. Linebacker Ben Talley, a Griffin native who is
trying to comeback from a horrible knee injury suffered in the '96
preseason with the New York Giants, was in the right place at the
right time on a couple of occasions, filling holes and defending a
pass. ... Running back Gary Downs, a Columbus native, made a few
nice blocks while working at fullback. The only players listed on
the roster as fullbacks are Christian and rookie free agent Darren
Fisk of Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   Quick money
</P>
<P>
   There are only two Falcons who have reporting bonuses written
into their contracts. Second-year linebacker Henri Crockett made
$6,000 by showing up Thursday, and Anderson earned $25,000.
Anderson's bonus actually is tied to his weight upon returning. He
has to show up weighing less than 240 pounds. Thursday morning when
players were weighed, he checked in at 238. Anderson did not,
however, earn his $25,000 offseason workout bonus, which required
that he be present for 51 of 64 supervised workouts in Suwanee.
Anderson's deal was worked out by former Falcon officials. ``They
wanted to make the whole thing (a $50,000 bonus) connected to
workouts,'' said Anderson, who lives in Salt Lake City in the
offseason. ``But I said, `Come on guys, I don't live here in the
offseason so I can't be here. Let's do at least part of it so I can
be rewarded for working out on my own. If I show up less than 240,
you'll know I've been working out.'''
</P>
<P>
   Et cetera
</P>
<P>
   The eighth annual Falcons/Red Cross Blood Drive will be today
and Saturday. Every donor will receive a pair of free tickets to
the team's preseason opener at the Georgia Dome, Aug. 7 against the
Tennessee Oilers. Blood can be donated in Suwanee, North Point
Mall, Gwinnett Place Mall, Town Center Mall, Northlake Mall and
Shannon Mall. ... Individual tickets to regular season games are
now available at the Georgia Dome or from Ticketmaster at
404-249-6400.

IS RETIREMENT IN JOE TORRE'S FUTURE? 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By JACK CURRY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ There are moments, private and public, when Joe Torre
ponders the future and wonders if he wants to manage the Yankees
next season. The thoughts flash by swiftly because Torre is too
busy orchestrating what has been an amazing season and is still
trying to insure that it finishes with a flourish in October.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the moments exist, sneaking up on Torre: when he misses
sharing a quiet dinner with his wife, Ali. Or when he misses
hearing the newest song his 2{-year-old daughter, Andrea Rae, has
learned. Or when a reporter suddenly inquires about 1999 while
Torre is still engrossed in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   If the Yankees continue their blinding pace and set a
major-league record for victories in the regular season and then
motor through the postseason to win their second World Series in
three years, would Torre, who is 58, consider resigning? Would he
stroll away as a two-time champion and become a full-time husband
and father?
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year, I wasn't having as much fun,'' Torre said. ``This
year, I'm having fun doing this. As long as it's fun, I'll keep
doing it. If it's not fun anymore, I'll leave. I don't know when
that will be. Right now, I want to do it for a few more years. But
that could change in a month.''
</P>
<P>
   There was a trace of uncertainty in Torre's voice, perhaps just
enough doubt to make the managerial watch a bit more intriguing in
November if the Yankees cooperate in October. After Torre steered
the Yankees to a championship in his first season as manager in
1996, a journey that was fraught with inspirational stories, his
wife asked him to quit and leave while he was on top.
</P>
<P>
   Torre had waited 4,268 games as a superb player and an
underrated manager to reach postseason play and finally had a World
Series ring. So Ali Torre wanted him home. Instead, he wanted to
defend a title and signed a revised three-year, $2.8 million
contract. So this season could be deja vu all over again in the
Torre household.
</P>
<P>
   ``My wife is still doing that,'' Torre said. ``My wife would
like me to quit. She doesn't tell me that on a daily basis, but she
does feel that way. She wouldn't want to insist that I quit. She
knows I wouldn't be happy if I did that right now. She's the most
unselfish person I know.''
</P>
<P>
   Ali Torre chuckled over her car phone after being told her
husband had described her as very unselfish. She insisted that her
unselfishness stretches only to a certain degree.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, I would like to have him around a little more
often,'' said Ali Torre, 40. ``I miss his companionship. I've been
with him a long time. There are things that he wants to do
professionally, and I wouldn't want to put a damper on what he's
doing this year. He's happy doing what he's doing.''
</P>
<P>
   But she paused and added: ``I'd be very happy when he decides
he's had enough. For now, he's not there.''
</P>
<P>
   They two met at a hotel bar in Cincinnati where Ali was a
waitress in 1981 when he was managing the Mets. They were married
in 1987. For now, Ali Torre expressed strong support for his
pursuit of another World Series ring.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not saying I'll feel the same way in six months,'' she
said. ``I do go through the dog days when I miss him. I don't know
if I thought this was taking him away from me, I might say that
it's time to stop. If I really needed him or our daughter needed
him to stay together, at some point, I might have to say that.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   While Torre said he was thankful for his daughter because his
wife focused on her while he was immersed in the Yankees, Ali Torre
conceded that his daughter missed her father when he was on the
road. She blows kisses to Torre on television and shouts, ``Let's
go, Yankees.'' But Ali Torre was bothered last week when she told
Andrea that her father would be home the next day and the child
responded, ``Then he's just going to leave again.'' ``How do you
answer that?'' Ali Torre asked. ``I didn't know what to say.''
</P>
<P>
   Torre, who has three grown children from two previous marriages,
acknowledged that Ali and Andrea's well-being would be the major
factor that could influence him to cease managing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Aside from spending more time with my wife, being with my
daughter more is the one area that could make me do something,''
Torre said. ``I miss things.''
</P>
<P>
   If the Yankees win again, there are merits both for staying and
leaving. Torre, who will earn $1 million for managing this year and
is scheduled to make $1 million in 1999, could decide to imitate
Phil Jackson and Jerry Seinfeld by leaving while he is king. Torre
could also decide that a title in 1998 means there is reason to
stay in the Bronx and try to win it all again in 1999. The more
championships Torre gets, the more he enhances his growing
credentials as a player-manager entry for the Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we go to the World Series and win a World Series and if I'm
still energized by it the way that I am now, I'd want to do it a
few times,'' Torre said. ``When you leave the game after finishing
first, you're going out as a champion. Being a champion, you always
have that under your belt.''
</P>
<P>
   In one breath, Torre sounded like a manager who would return in
1999. In the next, he sounded like one who would consider it
special to leave a game he has been in since 1960 with the newest,
shiniest ring on his finger. When Torre was asked if he really
envisioned himself managing a few more years if he were energized
by it, he hedged slightly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel that way today,'' Torre said. ``I'm enjoying this
period. Whether it's because of what we're doing or the people
we're doing this with, I'm enjoying it. I don't know if that will
change or if that will be the case in another year.''

 &HT;    Falcons' fiery first day
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- When Keith Brooking's big day finally arrived, he was
pumped. He was so excited, in fact, that the Falcons' rookie
linebacker from Georgia Tech got in the first fight of training
camp in the first full-contact drill of the first practice .
</P>
<P>
   That was the type of excitement generated all over the field in
Suwanee on Thursday, as coach Dan Reeves began his second training
camp with the Falcons. Eighty players are competing for 53 roster
spots.
</P>
<P>
   But Brooking's 45-second scrap with tight end O.J. Santiago took
center stage. It took several players and coaches to break up the
melee,which ended with Santiago, a second-year tight end, jawing
from afar: ``Don't be showing off for all the cameras. You're a
first-round pick, and everybody's watching you.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, there were cameras _ and players _ around. Dozens of
media representatives were present. There also were approximately
60-75 fans on the hill overlooking the practice field, many only 60
yards from the brawl.
</P>
<P>
   The 93-degree heat, 43-percent humidity and broiling sun were
enough to get tempers going. But throw in Brooking, who has been
openly eager to put the pads on after almost six weeks of drills in
shorts, jerseys and helmets, you get a very combustible mix.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things got a little hot,'' said Brooking.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really have been wanting to hit somebody; it's been a long
time since I've been in pads. In a situation like that, the first
drill, the adrenaline was flowing, and I got a little carried away,
a little out of hand.''
</P>
<P>
   After practice, both players cooled down.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first thing I'm going to do is go in the lockerroom and
apologize,'' Brooking said. ``That's part of football, and that
stuff stays on the field.'' Santiago agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't consider it a big deal,'' he said. ``We're
competitive. Some people might say, `You win some, you lose some.'
I say, `You win some, and hate to lose any.' It's part of the game.
It's over. We'll be cool.''
</P>
<P>
   On a day that was predictably ragged at times, Reeves was by no
means unhappy about the scrap, which came just a few snaps after
veteran defensive end Chuck Smith yelled at veteran offensive
tackle Bob Whitfield in the same drill.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to happen when you start hitting the first time,''
Reeves said.
</P>
<P>
   The first hit of camp had nothing to do with physical contact.
Safety Devin Bush sported wild socks, which featured black and
white horizontal stripes nearly up to his knees. His teammates were
calling him ``Beetlejuice.''
</P>
<P>
   After about an hour of warmups and drills, the contact drill was
clearly the highlight of a 2 1/2-hour practice.
</P>
<P>
   Brooking and Santiago got tied up in a one-on-one blocking and
tackling drill where an offensive player blocks a defender as a
back tries to scoot through a hole three yards wide.
</P>
<P>
   Santiago blew Brooking out with a solid block, and when Brooking
thought Santiago kept going after the whistle, they locked up. Once
separated, Santiago went after Brooking, yelling all the while.
Santiago's helmet was torn off the the process, and he ended up
with a scratch near his left eye though nobody landed any solid
blows. The Falcons, who have had seven winning seasons in 32 years,
will practice today at 9 a.m. and 3 p.m. as they prepare for the
season opener on Sept. 6 at Carolina. The Falcons will play
Tennessee in the first preseason game on Aug. 7 in the Georgia
Dome.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's kind of nice,'' Reeves said of the tension in the air.
``You got a couple guys with the temperment it takes to play
football.''

 RealNetworks, Apple Take Aim At Microsoft   By Julia Angwin  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
A new front has opened in the government's war against Microsoft:
multimedia software.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Until now, antitrust allegations against the software giant have
focused mostly on its Web browsing software and on agreements with
Internet service providers.
</P>
<P>
   But yesterday, Rob Glaser, CEO of RealNetworks in Seattle, told
a congressional panel that Microsoft's latest multimedia software
causes his firm's competing software to ``break.''
</P>
<P>
   And Apple Computer disclosed that the Justice Department is
investigating whether Microsoft tried to bully Apple out of the
multimedia software market.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just one more segment of the industry stepping forward
and saying, `It's happening to us, too,''' said Ed Black, president
of the Computer and Communications Industry Association in
Washington D.C.
</P>
<P>
   The new claims illustrate how broadly Microsoft's influence is
felt in the high-tech industry. And they also could spur the
Department of Justice to expand its antitrust case against the
Redmond, Wash., company.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft denies both allegations, saying the problem with
RealNetworks was due to a technical glitch and that it never tried
to bully Apple. However, Microsoft refused to send a representative
to defend the company during the congressional hearing chaired by
Senator Orrin Hatch, R-Utah.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't feel it was a sincere effort to provide a balanced
forum, and we chose not to participate,'' said Microsoft spokesman
Greg Shaw.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the panel of speakers at the Senate Judiciary Committee
hearing yesterday read like a list of Microsoft rivals: Larry
Ellison, the outspoken Microsoft critic who is CEO of Oracle Corp.;
Mitchell Kertzman of Sybase (which makes competing database
software); Jeff Papows of Lotus (a division of IBM that makes
competing office software); and Rob Glaser of RealNetworks (which
makes competing multimedia software).
</P>
<P>
   Many of the CEOs rehashed to the committee complaints that they
already had taken public _ such as Kertzman's allegation that
Microsoft tried to force him out of the market by giving away its
software for free.
</P>
<P>
   But RealNetworks CEO Glaser, a former Microsoft senior vice
president who had been silent in the Microsoft debate, stunned the
industry by joining the ranks of Microsoft critics.
</P>
<P>
   Glaser's change of heart was especially surprising because
Microsoft owns a 10 percent stake in his firm.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm here because Microsoft is taking actions that simply stop
our company's products from working,'' Glaser told the committee.
``This is not fair play.''
</P>
<P>
   Glaser demonstrated how RealNetworks' video playing software
stopped working after he loaded Microsoft's competing product onto
a personal computer. He said Microsoft had refused to fix the
problem despite repeated requests.
</P>
<P>
   ``Microsoft asks consumers in its advertisements, `Where do you
want to go today?''' Glaser said. ``But if Microsoft continues on
its present course, consumers will increasingly be asking, `Is
there anywhere I can go except where Microsoft wants me to?'''
</P>
<P>
   However, Microsoft said it has traced the problem to a glitch in
RealNetworks' software _ not its own. Microsoft said it soon will
post a description of the bug on its Web site.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, allegations emerged that Microsoft asked Apple
to curtail its development of multimedia software called QuickTime.
</P>
<P>
   The Wall Street Journal reported yesterday that Microsoft asked
Apple three times to stop making QuickTime for Windows in exchange
for Microsoft endorsing other Apple software.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft denied the charges. Apple executives would not comment
but confirmed that they had been subpoenaed by the Justice
Department.
</P>
<P>
   ``Multimedia is one area where Microsoft and Apple have some
disagreements, but we're trying to resolve them professionally,''
added Apple spokeswoman Katie Cotton.
</P>
<P>
   The allegations could add fodder to the pending antitrust case
against Microsoft, which was filed in May by the Justice Department
and 20 states. The suit accuses Microsoft of using its Windows
monopoly to promote its Web browser software.
</P>
<P>
   However, experts say it's unlikely that government prosecutors
could include new charges before the trial date of September 8.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't have time to investigate these charges while they
are getting ready for trial,'' said Rich Gray, an antitrust
attorney in San Jose. ``But once they get to the other end of this
trial, then they'll come back to it.''

 &HT;    Beat-up Braves down to one catcher
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ Reserve catcher Eddie Perez left the team
Thursday morning to return to Atlanta, where his wife Marisol
underwent emergency gall bladder surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Though he was expected to rejoin the team tonight in Pittsburgh,
the club played the Phillies with a prevailing numbers problem.
</P>
<P>
   Outfielder Michael Tucker was scratched two hours before
gametime due to a tender ankle sustained running the bases
Wednesday night. Infielders Walt Weiss (left quadriceps) and Tony
Graffanino (stiff neck) were available on emergency basis, giving
the club just 10 position players at 100 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But foremost, Perez's absence left manager Bobby Cox with just
one catcher. Cox has traditionally carried just two catchers,
though he typically designates a candidate for emergencies.
</P>
<P>
   Asked who his emergency catcher is currently, Cox replied, ``I
don't know. We don't have one. We got Graff, (Keith) Lockhart, and
(Ozzie) Guillen. I figure one of those could strap it on.''
</P>
<P>
   The situation did not faze Javy Lopez, who said, ``I'm going to
keep going. If I get hurt, I get hurt, either catching or hitting.
I cannot think about that.''
</P>
<P>
   Cox's best bet for back-up help may have been in the bullpen.
Reliever Russ Springer keeps a complete set of catching gear at his
Louisiana home and uses it for offseason training.
</P>
<P>
   Tucker jammed his ankle in his second at-bat Wednesday, when he
raced pitcher Yorkis Perez to first base and jammed his foot into
the bag.
</P>
<P>
   Though he remained in the game and later hit a triple, his left
ankle had stiffened by the time he reported to the clubhouse
Thursday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   A lesson learned?
</P>
<P>
   Denny Neagle's next start does not fall until Saturday night but
the left-hander used his bullpen session Thursday (the second of
two during his off-days) to shake off the worst start of his career
(nine runs in four innings against Chicago last Monday).
</P>
<P>
   Worried about the effectiveness of his change-up and simply
forgetting to use his breaking ball, Neagle blamed the Chicago
outing on mental shortcomings as much as physical ones.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to pitch like Nolan Ryan without a Nolan Ryan
fastball,'' he said. ``That's not fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the 103 pitches he threw that night, Neagle estimated he
threw just 15 offspeed pitches, when his optimum mix is 25 percent
changeups and 20 percent breaking balls.
</P>
<P>
   He admits to being scared to throw the changeup, though he has
seen improvement in the pitch in his side sessions.
</P>
<P>
   Tecnincally, his problems have stemmed from too much twist at
the hip during windup and then not staying on top of the pitch as
he releases it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two things,'' Neagle said. ``One, I'm getting to the point
where now I feel I've made a good correction that I'm going to feel
a lot more confident in my changeup this game. And the other thing
is mentally, making better pitch selection.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither side wanted to overemphasize what Mark Wohlers did
Wednesday night, but the fact that the right-hander retired the
side in order _ in just 11 pitches _ was the first encouraging
signal Wohlers has sent in a month.
</P>
<P>
   He threw first-pitch strikes to all three men he faced, threw
one effective split-finger fastball at 92 mph and said later his
concentration on his fastball is not the most effective way to
approach each outing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was concentrating on trying to get guys out instead of going
out there to try and prove I can throw my fastball for a strike,''
he said. ``Yeah, I'd like to throw more fastballs but I can be more
effective when I work more on getting outs.

 &HT;    Bryant trying to make her move to Moultrie pay off
 &HT;    By Karen Rosen
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   HEMPSTEAD, N.Y. _ Katie Beth Bryant can only go so high in the
diving world in her best event. She's a 1-meter specialist in a
sport that welcomes only the higher 3-meter springboard event at
the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   Bryant, 18, who trains in Moultrie, finished seventh Thursday at
the Goodwill Games among 10 divers, the best of whom was Irini
Lashko of Russia. Bryant placed second among the four Americans.
Bryant said she prefers the 1-meter ``because it's lower to the
water, which means it's harder to finish your dives. I just like
the feeling of jumping, flipping as fast and as high as I can, and
see if I make it in.''
</P>
<P>
   The low board has tried to make it into the Olympics for years.
The World Championships accepted the event for men and women in
1991, but the Olympics has resisted.
</P>
<P>
   Women's water polo is the only new aquatic event on the program
for Sydney in 2000, and the relatively new events of synchronized
diving from the 3-meter and 10-meter platforms may be next in line
because they are considered more spectator- and
television-friendly.
</P>
<P>
   Despite its limitations, Bryant said she's happy to stay with
1-meter ``as long as I can keep being internationally competitive.
This is so much fun, I can settle for this.''
</P>
<P>
   Before every dive Thursday, she smiled and blew kisses to
friends and family in the crowd. Her family, including her two
brothers and two sisters, arrived from Chatham, Ill. to cheer her
on.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I'm all serious and sad, I don't dive well,'' said Bryant,
who will attend LSU on a diving scholarship. ``I do best when I'm
relaxed.''
</P>
<P>
   Bryant took up diving after giving up gymnastics. ``To me, it
seemed a little easier on your body,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The oldest child, she left Chatham in 1995 when her coach moved
away.
</P>
<P>
   ``He told me that the best place in the United States to train
was Moultrie, Ga., so that's where I've been for three years,'' she
said. ``And they proved it to me. They're the best.''
</P>
<P>
   Bryant describes Moultrie as ``a small town in South Georgia
with a big wonderful pool.''
</P>
<P>
   She represents Moss Farms Diving and lives on a farm with Scott
and Virginia Hart, whose son dives at the University of Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   Now when Bryant goes back to Illinois, she said, ``They make fun
of me for saying y'all.''

 &HT;    Glover and Jones take cautious bite of the Big Apple
 &HT;    By Steve Hummer
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK -- Times Square has been sanitized for your protection,
but there remain stubborn pockets of resistance. Hence, it took but
one stroll around their team hotel for Dion Glover and Jumaine
Jones to receive a primer in the weird.
</P>
<P>
   ``We saw a cross-dresser right away. That's been the strangest
thing so far,'' said Glover.
</P>
<P>
   The educational experiences of these Goodwill Games for the two
Georgia representatives on the U.S. basketball team have been
many-pronged.
</P>
<P>
   They have been lectured on the dangers of being big targets in a
tough city. Not that any of them have had a whole lot of time to
get out among 'em. Otherwise occupied by practices and games, many
sights go unseen.
</P>
<P>
   They have been offered a varied diet of international flavor. A
couple of 19-year-olds, however, are not going to heed all the
lessons of good nutrition. ''I just want a home-cooked meal,''
Glover said. ''I end up going to McDonald's almost every day.''
</P>
<P>
   A friendship has been further strengthened between Georgia
Tech's Glover and Georgia's Jones _ they'll leave it to the
graduates to keep hate alive. The two always seem paired. They came
up as the state's two dominant players, Glover from Decatur and
Jones from Camilla. They played AAU ball together, went through the
recruiting gristmill together and then found themselves among the
collegians selected to go against the world here at Madison Square
Garden.
</P>
<P>
   They're not Goodwill roommates, ''but we might as well be, we
spend so much time in each other's rooms,'' Glover said.
</P>
<P>
   In the pure basketball sense, they entered Thursday night's
semifinal against Lithuania still riding the international
basketball learning curve. Because of the U.S. team's need for
size, the 6-7 Jones has gotten a little more playing time (an
average of 23 minutes in first the three games) than shooting guard
Glover (16 minutes per). Jones was averaging seven points and three
rebounds a game; Glover nine and two.
</P>
<P>
   They both should return to their campuses a little hardened by
the experience. The calluses began forming in their first Goodwill
game, an 84-76 loss to Puerto Rico.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a lot different than college ball,'' Jones said. ''There
was a lot more banging than I expected. There's a lot more Dennis
Rodmans here (in terms of physical play, not appearance). Coach
Haskins (Clem, the USA's head man) has been on me to get a lot
tougher, more aggressive.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And these guys just don't miss open shots. You leave anyone
open, they're going to hit it,'' Glover said. He tussled with
Puerto Rico guard Eddie Casiano in the first game and lost (Casiano
ended with 31 points, Glover just six on 2-of-7 shooting). But
Glover (13 points on 5-of-6 from the field) was a key during the
U.S. blowout of Brazil Tuesday that got them to the medal round.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've really come together. We were passing the ball much
better, playing like more of a team. That first game we were a
bunch of individuals,'' Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   That much accomplished, it is time to think about things more
familiar. Atlanta and Athens beckon. ''Yeah, I'm getting a little
homesick,'' Jones said. How much more Goodwill, after all, can a
body take?

 &HT;    Good night at the track
 &HT;    By Mike Fish
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNIONDALE, N.Y. _ Before the lights dimmed on a final night at
the track venue, Michael Johnson anchored the men's 1,600-meter
relay to a world record and Jackie Joyner-Kersee staggered home to
a gold medal in her final heptathlon Wednesday. Imagine that.
Nobody talked up the possibility of a world mark _ dipping into Ted
Turner's pocket for a $100,000 bonus _ and the 36-year-old JJK
hadn't finished a heptathlon since the 1996 Olympic Trials.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. men lowered the world mark to 2 minutes, 54.20 seconds,
breaking the record of 2:54.29 that Johnson also anchored at the
1993 World Championships. Jerome Young (44.4) sprinted to the lead
before Macon native Antonio Pettigrew (43.2) and Tyree Washington
(43.5) stretched the cushion to 30 meters when Johnson (43.1)
touched the baton. After Young's extremely fast start from a
standstill, the rest of the team knew that with their running
starts a record was possible. ``I didn't want to let these guys
down,'' said Johnson, beaming. Minutes after the record,
Joyner-Kersee finished sixth in the heptathlon's closing 800 meters
_ but less than two seconds behind Dedee Nathan, who needed to beat
her by three seconds for victory. ``Everybody was saying I was
going to quit (the 800),'' Joyner-Kersee said. ``When people were
cheering me when I came on the track, I thought I was going to
break down and cry but I had to run the 800.'' Overshadowed
Wednesday was redemption for the men's 400-meter relay team, which
failed to get the baton around the track at the last two World
Championships and was second to the Canadians at the Atlanta Games
_ the only U.S. Olympics loss. Maurice Greene held off a charge
from Canadian anchor Donovan Bailey.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. women lost the 1,600-meter relay to Jamaica, while the
400-meter team nipped a Bahamas group that featured Atlanta
resident Pauline Davis and University of Georgia senior Debbie
Ferguson. The Americans won in the year's fastest time of 42.06.

BRAWLEY FAILS TO APPEAR AT TRIAL OF HER FORMER ADVISERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (cb) 
 By WILLIAM GLABERSON    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   POUGHKEEPSIE, N.Y. _ More than a decade after she frustrated
investigators by refusing to testify about her allegations of
abduction and rape, Tawana Brawley failed to appear in court
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   She has never testified under oath about her sketchy account of
being assaulted and held captive by a group of white men over four
days in 1987. Her absence Thursday exposed a deep rift among her
advisers in the final days of the defamation case brought against
them by Steven Pagones, the white former prosecutor they accused of
raping Brawley, a black teen-ager. The question of what damages to
assess could go to the jury as soon as Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The absence of Brawley, now 26, was a sharp embarrassment to C.
Vernon Mason, the adviser who broke with his co-defendant, Alton H.
Maddox Jr., and invited Brawley to end her silence here, in the
damages portion of the case in which the jurors have already
determined that her story was false.
</P>
<P>
   The trial here was ``God's opportunity to correct history,''
Mason told a throng of reporters drawn by his promise that she
would take the stand. ``For all these years,'' he said, ``people
who care about her have wanted to share her story.''
</P>
<P>
   Mason stopped short of criticizing Brawley for failing to
appear. But it was clear that by inviting her so publicly he had
violated the central premise of the advisers that has won them
staunch backing from a core of supporters: to keep Brawley away
from the storm her account caused.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the courtroom, Mason's lawyer, Stephen Jackson, said he
was disappointed because her testimony was ``important to the
community'' in a case that drew national attention. Brawley was 15
when she was found Nov. 28, 1987, in a plastic bag with excrement
spread on her body and racial epithets etched on her skin.
</P>
<P>
   ``I spoke about the importance to the community,'' Jackson said,
``not only the African-American community, but the community at
large. I think it's important that Tawana come to court and bring
some closure to what has attracted some controversy and what has
caused all this damage and wreaked havoc to people's personal
lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson did not make it clear whether he was referring to havoc
in the lives of Pagones, who says he was anguished by baseless
charges, or Mason, who was disbarred in 1995. Mason has said that
he stands by his assertions that Pagones kidnapped, raped and
sodomized Brawley.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson also addressed the strains within the defense that have
been obvious in recent days. Maddox had said he would not join in
calling Brawley and doubted Mason could produce her.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is my position that she should be here,'' Jackson said
Thursday. ``I don't understand why others would feel otherwise. But
so be it.''
</P>
<P>
   At the defense table, Maddox, who was suspended from law
practice because of the Brawley case, sat next to his old ally,
Mason. They did not speak. Both looked out to the well of the
courtroom, where they have spent more than eight months fighting
what may be their last case together.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the courthouse, Pagones'lawyer, William Stanton, was
asked what question he would have liked answered had Brawley
appeared. The question, he said, would be ``Why did she do it?''
</P>
<P>
   Pagones, 37, said, ``This is a fitting end to this entire
fiasco.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Thursday's events marked the end of a perplexing chapter in the
Brawley trial. It remained unclear, for example, why Jackson had
said earlier this week that Brawley would appear. It was also
unclear whether Mason had risked a schism in the defense to argue
that he should be assessed lower damages than the other defendants
because he alone had tried to obtain Brawley's testimony.
</P>
<P>
   Court was scheduled to begin Thursday morning at 9:30. Twenty
minutes later, with scores of reporters milling about in front of
the Dutchess County Courthouse, Jackson and Mason walked into the
crowd without the other members of the defense team and, more
notably, without Brawley.
</P>
<P>
   For the last two days, they had faced increasing skepticism here
as fraudulent Brawley sightings were reported in Poughkeepsie.
``Where's Tawana?'' someone shouted Thursday morning as Jackson and
Mason moved toward a forest of microphones.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson said he and Mason had worked for 48 hours to bring
Brawley as a witness. He said he had spoken to Brawley's mother,
who ``did raise some issues'' about whether her daughter should
testify.
</P>
<P>
   But Jackson said he had not had enough time to contact Brawley.
He said she was at an ``undisclosed location'' because reporters
had been pursuing her since July 13, when the jury ruled that
Pagones was defamed by the advisers, Mason, Maddox and the Rev. Al
Sharpton.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson said Brawley's mother did not know where she was.
</P>
<P>
   The reporters then followed Mason and Jackson into the
courtroom. There, with the jury assembled, Jackson said he had been
working ``feverishly in an attempt to get her up here'' and began
telling the jurors that it was important for history that they hear
her.
</P>
<P>
   Stanton objected, saying Jackson was trying to influence the
jury. Justice S. Barrett Hickman of State Supreme Court directed
him to complete his explanation after the jurors had left the room.
</P>
<P>
   Within a few minutes, the defense had rested its case, setting
the stage for the final arguments on damages.
</P>
<P>
   When the jury had been excused, Jackson delivered his full
remarks and asked for more time to try to arrange Brawley's
appearance.
</P>
<P>
   Hickman denied the request. ``She's had 10 and a half years,''
he said, ``to come and tell somebody under oath what her story
is.'' &QL;

 Merger to Mean the End of Pacific Exchange as We Know It   By Mark Veverka  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
 
So long ``P-Coast.''
<TEXT>
<P>
   To traders around the world, the options floor in the historic
Mills Building at 220 Montgomery St. has been affectionately
referred to as the ``P-Coast.''
</P>
<P>
   Meantime, the Chicago Board Options Exchange, the offspring of
the mother of all commodities markets, the 150-year-old Chicago
Board of Trade, has been rather unimaginatively tagged the
``C-Boe.''
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, the Philadelphia Stock Exchange _ which is itself
merging with the American Stock Exchange and Nasdaq _ was called
the ``Philly.'' (What else?) And before it was absorbed by another
exchange, the New York Stock Exchange's options offshoot was
nicknamed the ``Knife.'' Well, you get the idea.
</P>
<P>
   So, what new moniker will come from the proposed marriage of the
P-Coast and the C-Boe is anybody's guess. (My vote goes to PCBOE,
or ``Placebo.'' Or how about the Surf Board Options Exchange, or
SoBoe?)
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the new merged entity is called, you can be assured it
will mark the end of California's revered Pacific Exchange as we
know it.
</P>
<P>
   The name issue ``is an open question,'' says Thomas Ascher, vice
chairman of the CBOE and an independent market maker.
</P>
<P>
   But ``the clear intent is to have one institution,'' Ascher
says.
</P>
<P>
   The merger was inevitable. Technology is forcing stock and
futures exchanges all over the world to consider drastic change,
such as mergers with competitors and the adoption of electronic
trading systems.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the AMEX-Nasdaq-Philly combination provided the wake-up
call for Montgomery Street to get down to brass tacks with LaSalle
Street, the heart and soul of Chicago's financial district in the
south Loop.
</P>
<P>
   ``It certainly sharpened everybody's focus'' to negotiate more
arduously toward a marriage, Ascher says.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly thereafter, officials from the two exchanges engaged in
marathon meetings at Chicago's Standard Club, a prestigious social
club just a stone's throw from LaSalle. The negotiations continued
with unglamorous talks held at the terminal building of Denver
International Airport.
</P>
<P>
   Rapid and profound changes in the financial landscape across the
Atlantic also applied pressure to make a deal. The advent of a more
integrated Europe had forged heated new competition for American
exchanges. Plus, French and German exchanges were aggressively
experimenting with electronic trading systems that challenged the
future of traditional open-outcry systems, which are still used in
Chicago and San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   The Deutsche Terminborse, or DTB, wrangled a big chunk of
futures business away from London exchanges earlier this year by
implementing electronic trading.
</P>
<P>
   Such dramatic transformations made it clear that the Pacific
Exchange needed to do something quickly. About 80 percent of all
transactions at the CBOE are electronic, thanks largely to computer
trading systems that are more advanced than those currently used at
the Pacific Exchange. But only 20 percent of all transactions are
paperless at the Montgomery Street exchange, says Robert Kovell,
vice chairman of the Pacific Exchange and principal of Kovell
Trading LLC.
</P>
<P>
   ``Technology is driving the deal. We've spent a great deal of
money duplicating the efforts of the CBOE in regards to
technology,'' Kovell says.
</P>
<P>
   If the deal is approved by the members of each exchange, the
Pacific Exchange will be able to share Chicago's technology and
upgrade its operations more quickly and efficiently, Kovell says.
</P>
<P>
   Still, many loose ends remain untied. Will the new entity still
build a new facility South of Market or will it move to existing
space currently occupied by BankAmerica?
</P>
<P>
   And what will happen to the Pacific Exchange's sleepy stock
trading operations? Is the exchange's downtown Los Angeles floor
history, or will both equity trading floors get spun-off and merged
with other stock markets?
</P>
<P>
   Both Ascher and Kovell say the combined memberships will need to
resolve these issues. But one thing is certain, an options floor
will remain in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   And that's welcome news to trader Karim Tahawi, who left the
City of Broad Shoulders for the Barbary Coast four years ago. He
froze his assets off in Chicago and doesn't want to go back.
``There are a lot of people who are here because they didn't want
to live in New York or Chicago,'' Tahawi says.
</P>
<P>
   It looks like they still won't have to.

CHIEF OF SECRET SERVICE WHITE HOUSE DETAIL TESTIFIES BEFORE GRAND
JURY 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By DON VAN NATTA JR.   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton's personal bodyguard, Larry
Cockell, and Harold Ickes, a former senior White House aide,
testified on Thursday before the federal grand jury that is
investigating the Monica Lewinsky matter.
</P>
<P>
   On an unusually busy day at the federal courthouse near Capitol
Hill, three uniformed officers also testified, presumably about
what they had seen and heard while working in the West Wing of the
White House. The five men appeared before two grand juries, another
sign that the Whitewater independent counsel, Kenneth Starr, has
accelerated his six-month-old inquiry of the president.
</P>
<P>
   Cockell and Ickes have much in common: Their jobs required them
to spend many hours with Clinton, and both earned the president's
trust and confidence. But there is an important distinction in
their roles. As the Secret Service agent in charge of the
president's security detail, Cockell is charged with protecting and
defending Clinton's personal safety. But the president's political
survival was, and still is, the central mission of Ickes, first as
a deputy White House chief of staff and in recent months as an
unofficial adviser during the current inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   Cockell's long-awaited testimony, which lasted precisely one
hour on Thursday afternoon, was made possible last Friday when
Chief Justice William Rehnquist denied a Justice Department request
to block Secret Service agents from testifying. Cockell's lawyer,
John Kotelly, told reporters that his client had very little
information about conversations the president had with Ms. Lewinsky
or his aides.
</P>
<P>
   ``In cases where, you know, he's in private situations, secure
situations, like the White House, the president has privacy, and
the Secret Service respects that privacy,'' said Kotelly, who
declined to say what his client had told the grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   Kotelly said Cockell, who asked to be temporarily relieved from
his assignment last week, is eager to resume his usual duties,
though he is concerned the media attention will undermine his
effectiveness.
</P>
<P>
   ``He will not be able to have the same type of anonymity he had
before, and obviously he regrets losing that anonymity because in
some ways it affects his ability to do his job in protecting the
president,'' Kotelly said. He added that that Cockell's superiors
had not decided when or if he would resume his position as the
chief of the president's protective detail.
</P>
<P>
   Ickes, a surprise witness, testified for about 25 minutes late
on Thursday, apparently before another grand jury. Before stepping
into a taxi, he said he did not relish the experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't enjoy it, but it's your civic duty,'' he said. Asked
what prosecutors had quizzed him about, he said simply: ``Name and
address.''
</P>
<P>
   In a separate interview on Thursday night, Ickes said that he
expects to return for more questions next week or the following
week. He probably will be asked about his meetings and discussions
with White House aides and lawyers after it became known on Jan. 21
that Starr was investigating whether Clinton had tried to cover up
a relationship with Ms. Lewinsky, a former White House intern who
celebrated her 25th birthday on Thursday with her family in Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's appearance marked the second time that Ickes has
answered questions from a grand jury impaneled by Starr. In June,
Ickes testified before a grand jury in Alexandria, Va., where he
was asked about the Pentagon's improper disclosure of details from
Linda Tripp's personnel file to a writer for The New Yorker
magazine. Mrs. Tripp is the Pentagon employee who surreptitiously
recorded conversations with Ms. Lewinsky and gave them to Starr's
office.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In another matter, the District of Columbia Bar Association has
notified Starr's office that members of his staff, including chief
deputy Jackie M. Bennett Jr., are the subjects of an inquiry into
possible ethics violations, according to a person with knowledge of
the situation, which was first reported on Thursday in USA Today.
</P>
<P>
   The person said that the investigation involved work done in
Starr's inquiry of Clinton, possibly linked to accusations that the
office improperly leaked secret grand jury material to reporters.
On Tuesday, Starr's prosecutors asked a federal appeals court here
to overturn a decision by Judge Norma Holloway Johnson of U.S.
District Court to compel prosecutors to prove they did not
illegally disclose grand jury material.

SMITH'S KNEE IRRITATED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WICHITA FALLS, Texas _ Cowboys running back Emmitt Smith missed
both practices yesterday because of an irritated right knee.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys and Smith, who spent much of the day receiving
treatment, described the problem as minor after a magnetic
resonance imaging came back negative.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got a little fluid on it,'' Cowboys coach Chan Gailey
said. ``They are being precautionary with it and smart about it. We
want to make sure some of (the water) is worked out before we get
him back on the field.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith, who said he first was bothered by the injury Wednesday,
said it wasn't anything serious.
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys trainer Jim Maurer echoed Gailey and Smith, saying the
team was being careful. Smith is listed as day-to-day and possibly
could return to practice as soon as today.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want it to flare up anymore than it has,'' Maurer
said. ``We told him to take the day off and re-evaluate it. I've
got to see how he is. If he's better, he'll practice'' today.
</P>
<P>
   Smith sprained his right knee before, but Maurer said he has
never had ``this particular problem.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Maurer also reiterated it wasn't a major issue and said
Smith would have been cleared to play if the Cowboys had a game
today.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the situation left Gailey feeling better about the
off-season signing of former Seahawks standout Chris Warren as
Smith's backup.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel very fortunate to have a good backup,'' Gailey said.
``This could happen at any point and time. Chris is a proven guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Warren has rushed for 6,706 yards in eight seasons, including
four 1,000-yard seasons and three trips to the Pro Bowl. &QL; 
MILLS CONSISTENT, BROOKS STRUGGLING &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The early reviews are in on the battle for the No. 2 receiver
spot, and Ernie Mills and Macey Brooks have landed on opposite ends
of the spectrum.
</P>
<P>
   Gailey said Mills has been the most consistent of the
contenders, namely Brooks, Stepfret Williams, Billy Davis and
former TCU standout Jimmy Oliver.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ernie hasn't had the big day that some of the others guys have
had,'' Gailey said. ``But he's been consistent on a daily basis.
Billy has had two or three big days, so has Step and so has Jimmy.
Macey has struggled the most out of all of them right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Brooks, considered to have the most big-play potential, has been
plagued by dropped balls, though Gailey said he has improved the
past couple of days. Brooks was especially impressive yesterday
with a couple of leaping grabs.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys' final decision won't be taken lightly, and Gailey
said they are keeping track of everything.
</P>
<P>
   ``We keep up with every snap,'' he said. ``We know how many
times a ball has been thrown to a guy. How many drops. How many
strips. We know how many yards the pass was. We know every snap
there is.'' &QL; 
STRICKLAND IN THE MIDDLE &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys middle linebacker Fred Strickland said he wasn't the
happiest camper when he first learned he would be in a battle for
his job this season with Randall Gotf`e\5( ``I didn't know what to
think at first because of all the talk of Randall getting to start
in the middle and I didn't even have a say-so in the matter,''
Strickland said. ``But the coaches came to me and told me the
situation and I was fine. I feel like I can handle the
competition.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, it doesn't appear there will be any.
</P>
<P>
   With Broderick Thomas' season-ending knee injury, it appears
Strickland will keep his starting job. He played much of last
season with pain in his right knee, but he said he's healthy and in
much better shape to have a better season in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came into camp a little heavy last year, at 260 and I played
at 255,'' Strickland said. ``Now, I'm at 240. I think it's helped
my speed and I haven't lost my strength.'' &QL; 
BRIEFLY &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys, who scored only 19 touchdowns on 56 trips inside
the 20-yard line last season, worked on red-zone offense for the
first time yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   Gailey said he hopes Deion Sanders will be able to participate
in today's afternoon practice. Sanders, who has been out since
having his ankle scoped in May, is listed as day-to-day. Gailey
said the final decision will be made by Sanders and the trainers. &QL; 
THEY SAID IT &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year was like a nightmare, like looking at your
mother-in-law. I want to forget it.'' _ Cowboys guard Nate Newton

DOCTORS BEGIN DRUG TREATMENT ON PARALYZED CHINESE GYMNAST 
</HEADLINE>
  (af) 
 By FRANK LITSKY    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNIONDALE, N.Y. _ After an expedition through red tape, doctors
at the Nassau County Medical Center in adjacent East Meadow began
Thursday night to pour an experimental drug into the veins of Sang
Lan, 17, the Chinese gymnast, in hopes of alleviating her
paralysis.
</P>
<P>
   Sang sustained a severe spinal injury Tuesday night when she
landed on her head during a routine warmup vault in the Goodwill
Games at Nassau Coliseum. Before the drug treatment started, Dr.
Vincent Leone, who is treating Sang, said her condition had not
changed in the last 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's still guarded,'' said Leone, who heads the medical
center's division of orthopedic spinal surgery. ``She's in very
good spirits. She knows exactly what's going on and she understands
the severity of her condition. But neurologically there's not much
improvement yet. There's no lower motor function, and she still
can't feel from midchest down.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to preserve as much arm function as possible. I'm
a little pessimistic about the lower extremities. Her head and her
upper neck have dislocated themselves from the lower neck and the
rest of the body. It's a credit to her physical condition that she
still has functioning in her upper extremities.''
</P>
<P>
   The hope is that the experimental drug GM-1, also known as
Sygen, will help restore functions. Although the same medication
helped Dennis Byrd, the former Jets defensive lineman, walk again
after a spinal injury in 1992, Sang was told it would not
necessarily improve her chances of recovery.
</P>
<P>
   The patient must start receiving the drug within 72 hours of
injury, but approval to use the drug was needed from several
groups. The approvals came, first from the medical center's
institutional review board, then from Chinese officials, then from
the Food and Drug Administration.
</P>
<P>
   But Thomas Gulotta, the Nassau County executive, said officials
of Fidia Pharmaceuticals in Washington, which makes the drug,
refused at first to send the medication because it could not reach
the company president, who was on vacation. Gulotta said he
enlisted the help of Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, R-N.Y., and the company
shipped the drug Thursday morning.
</P>
<P>
   The drug will be administered over six weeks in an effort to
encourage damaged neurological tissues to grow again.
</P>
<P>
   Leone said that Sang would undergo surgery Saturday morning to
fuse the C-6 and C-7 vertebrae and implant metal stabilizers.
</P>
<P>
   Sang's parents are expected to arrive from China on Saturday
night.
</P>
<P>
   Leone said the American doctors had met with Chinese doctors and
discussed Eastern and Western treatments. He said Sang would
receive acupuncture treatment as well, here and in China.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very difficult case,'' Leone said. ``It's very
tricky when you're dealing with spinal-cord injuries. We will try
anything to get her to walk again. It's unlikely she will, but a
lot of things are in her favor.'' &QL;

an attempt to conform with new sex shop laws, workers from the Big
Top Lounge on 8th Avenue carry out the remnants of demolished
``exotic dancer'' booths. Giving a glimmer of hope to the owners of
New York City's sex shops, a United States Supreme Court justice
chose Thursday to refer to the entire Court a request by the shop
owners to delay enforcement of a law that bans sex-oriented
businesses in most neighborhoods. (Edward Keating/New York Times

SPRINT, WORLDCOM TOP J.D. POWER SURVEY OF LONG-DISTANCE CUSTOMERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BEN SULLIVAN  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Sprint and WorldCom took top marks among
long-distance telephone carriers serving Southland households in a
J.D. Power and Associates survey.
</P>
<P>
   In the annual customer-satisfaction study, released Thursday,
WorldCom scored highest among the region's mainstream households,
meaning those that made fewer than $50 worth of calls each month,
while Sprint appealed most to high-volume callers. SNET, a New
England-based carrier, scored highest overall among mainstream
households, but the company does not offer phone service in
California.
</P>
<P>
   Among the losers locally, GTE and MCI both scored below average
among mainstream households.
</P>
<P>
   The survey polled more than 14,000 households nationally about
their attitudes toward their long-distance carrier and toward the
industry as a whole. Customers ranked phone companies on their
reliability, trustworthiness and quality of service, among other
factors.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Dresch, director of telecommunications analysis at J.D.
Power, said the survey found nearly half of customers felt it was
difficult to find a phone company they could trust, while a
majority were skeptical that pending mergers between major phone
companies are in the customers' best interests.
</P>
<P>
   So leery were customers of long-distance carriers that many
based their choice more on a company's image than on pricing,
Dresch said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the credibility factor,'' he said. ``Consumers want
honesty, no gimmicks, no hidden charges.''
</P>
<P>
   Feeding customer unease was the fact that one in 10 U.S.
households had been ``slammed'' in the past year. Slamming occurs
when a long-distance carrier switches a household to that carrier's
service without the customer's consent.
</P>
<P>
   The proportion of customers who voluntarily switched
long-distance providers in the past year increased slightly to 30
percent of all U.S. households, the study found.

<P>
   Taxpayers engaged in disputes with the Internal Revenue Service
will enjoy significant new protections under a bill that President
Clinton signed into law last week, including a requirement for
judicial review before a home can be seized to pay back taxes.
</P>
<P>
   The law has been heralded as an ambitious attempt to reshape the
culture of a feared agency into one that is more consumer friendly.
It establishes an outside board with authority to oversee IRS
management and policies, and strengthens the role of the taxpayer
advocate, an internal ombudsman.

   The law also includes a tax cut of sorts, a provision that cuts
to 12 months from 18 months the period that investors must hold
stocks or other assets to qualify for the lowest capital gains tax
rate, now 20 percent for most people.
</P>
<P>
   But Rep. Bill Archer, R-Texas, who heads the House Ways and
Means Committee, and other sponsors of the legislation say its most
important protection is in the shift of the burden of proof, from
the taxpayer to the IRS, in cases that reach United States Tax
Court.
</P>
<P>
   Archer says this change is intended to make the agency treat
taxpayers with more respect, though the provision will directly
affect no more than one tax return in 4,500: only 28,000 or so
cases a year are brought in tax court, and individuals filed 122
million returns this year.
</P>
<P>
   The shift in the burden will apply only to those taxpayers who
have kept proper records and have cooperated fully in auditing
before the case reaches tax court. For taxpayers who prevail there,
the new measure will provide greater opportunities to recover
accounting and legal costs.
</P>
<P>
   Tax experts, however, say these changes will come at a price:
Because IRS auditors know they will have to prove their case if it
goes to court, they will make greater demands on audited taxpayers
to provide documentation to support their returns.
</P>
<P>
   Other provisions in the law raise the ceiling to $50,000, from
$10,000, for taxes in dispute in small-claims cases, in which
taxpayers typically represent themselves in tax court, and
authorize up to $6 million a year for tax clinics to help
low-income people with their returns.
</P>
<P>
   The law also vastly expands relief for joint filers who contend
that they were unaware of tax cheating by spouses. Taxpayers who
can establish that they are ``innocent spouses'' will be liable
only for taxes due on their own income; the rule will apply both to
new cases and to those now in dispute.
</P>
<P>
   The measure also bars contact between auditors and appeals
officers of the IRS unless the taxpayer is also present. And tax
agents must tell taxpayers if they are going to make contact with
third parties, like employers or neighbors, except in criminal
cases or where the agency has reason to believe that such a notice
will allow a taxpayer to hide assets.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, so-called financial reality audits _ those of
people who have lavish life styles but report modest incomes _ will
be restricted to cases in which the agency has ``reasonable
indications'' of unreported income. Until now, the IRS has had
almost unlimited authority to conduct such audits.
</P>
<P>
   New rules will also apply to property seizures, a step the IRS
takes about 10,000 times a year. In addition to requiring judicial
review before the principal residence of a delinquent taxpayer or
any member of his immediate family can be seized, the legislation
prohibits seizure of a home when $5,000 or less is owed.
</P>
<P>
   The measure also makes IRS collection agents subject to laws
similar to those that bar private collection agents from making
harassing or abusive telephone calls.
</P>
<P>
   Further, the interest rate for taxpayers who are owed refunds
for more than 45 days will be increased by one percentage point _
the rate itself varies with the general level of interest rates _
to match the rate that the government charges those who underpay or
whose payments are past due.
</P>
<P>
   Archer, the chief tax writer in the House, said the new law
``gives David the taxpayer a stronger slingshot to use against
Goliath, the IRS.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, though the law has been praised for easing strains on
honest taxpayers caught up in disputes, it has been criticized on
another front: It will help tax cheats, two former tax
commissioners say.
</P>
<P>
   ``The changes will make it more difficult and more expensive to
enforce the tax laws against people who don't pay,'' said Donald C.
Alexander, who was IRS commissioner in the Nixon and Ford
administrations. ``And unless Congress provides more funds for
enforcement, which it won't, then these changes will help some
people get away with not paying.''
</P>
<P>
   Sheldon S. Cohen, who was IRS commissioner in the Johnson
administration, agreed. ``Every time you give a deadbeat a break,''
Cohen said, ``it hurts me, because I pay my taxes promptly and
honestly and those who do are being shortchanged.''
</P>
<P>
   Lee A. Sheppard, who critiques tax policy for the magazine Tax
Notes, said the bill would so hamper IRS enforcement and collection
efforts that it ``should be called the mobsters and drug dealers
tax relief act.''

RIDE NEARS END FOR ZANARDI FANS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILL SCHLOTTER  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Alex Zanardi said he became one of us with his
victory at last year's U.S. 500 at Michigan Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   A Formula One expatriate, expert at beating opponents into and
out of the curves, the Italian driver had struggled in his early
races on American speedways. Though he had won six races in just
over a year and a half on the Championship Auto Racing Teams
circuit, none of the victories had come on the big ovals. In fact,
his average finish on the speedways was 12th and he had never made
the top three.
</P>
<P>
   Zanardi felt that to earn acceptance on the American circuit, he
had to make a breakthrough and start doing well in the big-track
500-mile races.
</P>
<P>
   His win at Michigan last year accomplished that, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me to win that race was special,'' Zanardi said.
``(Americans) tend to judge you not only on how you do on the road
and street courses, but especially how you do on the ovals.... I
think I gained some of the hearts of the fans by winning on the
superspeedway. I became a little more American and a little less
Italian.''
</P>
<P>
   He also became nearly unbeatable.
</P>
<P>
   In 10 starts this season, Zanardi has won five times, been
runner-up twice and finished third once. He has won the past four
races and will break a CART record for consecutive wins should he
triumph again at this year's U.S. 500 at Michigan on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   He is perhaps the most aggressive driver on the CART tour, with
a style some of his opponents say borders on recklessness. He is
surely the most feared. No driver wants to see his No. 1 red Target
Chip Ganassi racer screaming up from the rear.
</P>
<P>
   In the course of outrunning the circuit this season, Zanardi is
on course _ with eight races remaining _ to challenge the season
victories record of eight set by Michael Andretti in 1991 and
matched by Al Unser Jr. in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   And it is likely Zanardi will have his second straight CART
season points title in his hip pocket long before the tour's final
race at California Speedway on Nov. 1.
</P>
<P>
   That shouldn't make the Fontana race an afterthought. It is
likely the event will be the final CART run for Zanardi, who has
said he would like to catch a ride with a major Formula One team
and return to his home in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   It is ironic that Zanardi likely will leave us on a track nearly
identical to the one in Michigan where he feels we embraced him _ a
superspeedway. And his departure will be a blow to American
open-wheel racing, struggling in the shadow of NASCAR to attract
fans, to lose a genuine star.
</P>
<P>
   So as the CART season plays out over its final eight races,
let's appreciate Alessandro Zanardi while we've got him.
</P>
<P>
   After all, he's one of us.
</P>
<P>
   Walk, don't run: Sunday's U.S. 500 will be the first CART race
run with the Handford Device, a square rear wing designed to slow
down the racers.
</P>
<P>
   Drivers became concerned about escalating speeds on the tour
last season after cars hit speeds in the lower 230 range at
Michigan and then went more than 240 at California Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   But Zanardi predicted whatever decrease comes with the new
device soon will be overcome by teams and drivers seeking an edge
over opponents.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just think when we get to Fontana at the end of the season,
we'll be back over 230 miles per hour,'' Zanardi said.
</P>
<P>
   Zanardi added that slowing the cars is the wrong approach. To
lower speeds, track owners must alter the tracks by making the
turns sharper, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Running on retreads: Lake Speed has resigned as driver of the
No. 9 Cartoon Network Winston Cup car and been replaced by Jerry
Nadeau, who was recently fired by the First Plus No. 13 team and
replaced by Wally Dallenback, who lost his ride in the No. 46 to
... well, you get the idea.
</P>
<P>
   Other Winston Cup changes include Ted Musgrave giving up his
seat in the Roush Racing No. 16 car to Kevin Lepage, who finished
second in Sunday's Busch Kenwood Home &AMP; Auto 300 at California
Speedway, next month. And Darrell Waltrip will move back into his
No. 17 car after subbing for Dale Earnhardt teammate Steve Park
during Park's recovery from injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Turkey Night: The 58th annual USAC Turkey Night Midget Grand
Prix will be held in Bakersfield this season, where defending
champion and 1998 Indy 500 pole winner Billy Boat is expected to
defend his title.
</P>
<P>
   The annual Thanksgiving eve race has been an annual event since
its first run in 1934 at Gilmore Stadium in Los Angeles. It was
held at Ventura Raceway last year.
</P>
<P>
   Nuts and bolts: Barring a conflict with his Winston Cup effort,
look for Jeff Gordon to drive at next year's Busch race at
California Speedway. Gordon, his wife Brooke and crew chief Ray
Evernham plan to own a Busch Grand National team next year with
Gordon driving in a few races. Look for his sponsor to suggest _
strongly _ that one of them be in Fontana.... Winston Cup fans will
soon have the ability to listen to radio conversations between
drivers and their teams on their home computers. The broadcasts
will be reached at NASCAR.com and will cost $12.95.... Joe Gibbs,
who will be Tony Stewart's boss next year when the Indy Racing
League star moves to Winston Cup racing, has given Stewart
permission to run in the Indy 500 next year. Gibbs wants Stewart in
Charlotte, N.C., later in the day, however, to run in the Coca-Cola
600.... Sunday's Pennsylvania 500 begins a stretch of 16 straight
weeks of racing for Winston Cup teams.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ The August issue of Vogue is just beginning to show
up in subscribers' mailboxes and on the newsstand. Its cover
features model Carolyn Murphy in elegant ivory evening wear atop
Conde Nast's future home at 4 Times Square.
</P>
<P>
   And given the events of this week, that is what you might call
bad timing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has come up at every appointment and event that I've been
to in the last day and a half _ that someone was hurt and that it
is attached to us,'' said one Conde Nast employee who insisted on
anonymity. ``I think people are really saddened by it and maybe
vicariously guilty. The building is presented in Vogue as a
parallel universe _ idealized _ then to have something like this
happen. It's a similar feeling to when Versace died _ something
we're all feeling together.''
</P>
<P>
   The collapse of an elevator support tower at 4 Times Square
comes at a time when the company could use a break from bad press.
Earlier this month, its star editor of The New Yorker, Tina Brown,
abruptly left to go start a media company with Miramax _ taking one
of the company's top publishers with her, Ronald Galotti from
Vogue.
</P>
<P>
   Then an article came out in Fortune calling the company's
finances essentially a house of cards and its chief executive,
Steven Florio, a congenital liar.
</P>
<P>
   Now this. The building that the company is supposed to move into
next year, that Conde Nast has so proudly touted as environmentally
progressive, is coming apart at the seams. This is the third
accident at the site.
</P>
<P>
   And the life-threatening building has been increasingly referred
to as the Conde Nast building. Vogue seems to be encouraging this
by using ``the new Conde Nast Building'' in a caption in the
fashion spread. But Conde Nast isn't the only future tenant _ the
magazine company will share the space with a law firm, Skadden,
Arps, Slate, Meagher &AMP; Flom.
</P>
<P>
   The public relations department at image-conscious Conde Nast
Publications tried to refer calls to Tishman Construction Corp.,
the building's general contractor.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been very happy with the building,'' said Andrea Kaplan,
a spokeswoman for Conde Nast. ``They have a very good safety record
and the building is running ahead of schedule.''
</P>
<P>
   But many employees say they would just as soon stay where most
of them are _ at 350 Madison Ave. Indeed, location is known to be
one of the reasons that Ms. Brown decided to leave The New Yorker _
she did not want to see the magazine folded into the rest of Conde
Nast's operations, nor moved from its independent location.
</P>
<P>
   The incident also made one Vogue writer question the wisdom of
having jeopardized the lives of major modeling talent for Vogue's
fashion shoot.
</P>
<P>
   ``You had some of the top models in the world there and they
were hanging over the edge,'' the writer said. ``It's frightening
to think about that. I'm sure they went up in the same elevator.''
</P>
<P>
   But Vogue said the magazine took every precaution when using the
building.
</P>
<P>
   ``We went to many, many meetings with the safety people _ it was
not something done on a whim,'' said Patrick O'Connell, a Vogue
spokesman. ``Obviously we're devastated by what happened,
particularly the loss of life.'' &QL;

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Sherry Britton, the onetime striptease star who at
age 80 has taken to calling herself Stripteasaurus Sex, has not
been following Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's attempts to clean up the
city's sex clubs. She's been too busy, working on her memoirs.
(``One thousand pages; think I need an editor?'' she asks
cheerfully.)
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Fiorello La Guardia's attempts to clean up the city she
remembers clearly.
</P>
<P>
   It was 1939 and Ms. Britton was working at Minsky's Gaiety, at
46th and Broadway, a theater that no longer exists.
</P>
<P>
   ``The law was, you couldn't show pubic hair, and there was a
girl named Margie Hart who had bright red pubic hair,'' Ms. Britton
says, ``Bright red. She had a detective friend who would warn her
when the censors were coming around and she would wear a G-string.
Then she started seeing somebody else and he got jealous and didn't
warn her and they closed us down.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Britton chuckles. There is a dichotomy to her language.
Sometimes she uses euphemisms and sometimes she does not.
Similarly, there was a dichotomy in Ms. Britton's act. At times,
she peeled off chiffon evening gowns to music by Tchaikovsky. At
times, she balanced two glasses of water on her bare breasts. Now
Ms. Britton forgoes delicacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``That little ... ''
</P>
<P>
   Whoops! Call the mayor's morality squad!
</P>
<P>
   `` ... shut down burlesque in New York.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Britton once inhabited the dreams of college boys. Now she
lives in a large apartment overlooking Gramercy Park. Her furniture
is classic and faded, and there is an impressive art collection
inherited from her husband, Robert Gross, a wealthy businessman.
</P>
<P>
   Three canisters of candy kisses are on the coffee table; Ms.
Britton offers up too much candy, which is as good a metaphor as
any for her. She started stripping at 15; was ``engaged'' (one
senses this is a euphemism) to 14 men, including, she says, Rex
Harrison, and will tell you that she loathed stripping _ it made
her feel cheap.
</P>
<P>
   Why didn't she marry Rex Harrison?
</P>
<P>
   ``He was really dear and sweet,'' Ms. Britton says. ``But I'd
been married at 14 _ a fake marriage, it turned out _ and it was a
horrible experience and I simply couldn't get married again. When I
saw `My Fair Lady' the other night I was furious at myself that I
thought so little of myself I didn't marry him. Anybody who was
respectable, they were good enough to be engaged to, I just
couldn't marry them.''
</P>
<P>
   Rex Harrison, during the time of this affair, was married.
Memories are selective, newspapers inaccurate.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Britton, in yellowed newspaper clips, is reported to be a
graduate of Tilden High School in Brooklyn, but this, like many
other parts of her life, is the work of an imaginative press agent.
</P>
<P>
   As Ms. Britton, who was born in New Brunswick, N.J., tells it,
she never attended high school. She was 2 when her mother walked
out, and she lived in foster homes or with her Aunt Bobbi and Uncle
Bumpsy, vaudeville performers. As part of his act, Uncle Bumpsy
unzipped his pants and removed an alarm clock that said, ``Time
flies.''
</P>
<P>
   What did Ms. Britton's father do?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know,'' she says. ``I know he was beating my mother
up. That he was doing beautifully.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Britton, in order to escape the man she was living with _
who beat her _ went to work in burlesque. The first place she
stripped was a place on the Bowery, the People's Theater, where
admission was 10 cents.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Britton exposed her breasts, then fainted.
</P>
<P>
   Having undergone analysis, she describes the episode in
psychoanalytic terms. ``I experienced what I now know was a
dissociative episode,'' she writes in her memoir. ``There seemed to
be two of me. One, onstage, undressing. The other saying, `What are
you doing, taking your clothes off for those morons?''
</P>
<P>
   But it was work. Ms. Britton moved uptown to the burlesque
theaters of Times Square. When La Guardia shut down burlesque
shows, at the end of 1941, she moved to 52nd street, to an upscale
club called Leon and Eddie's. Though she calls stripping ``the low
point of my life,'' she remembers this fondly, bringing out her
pink sequin G-string.
</P>
<P>
   Was the act changed?
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't,'' Ms. Britton says, ``I still stripped. But I also
did production numbers. People addressed me as Miss Britton. There
was respect. All the celebrities came to see me.''
</P>
<P>
   But she never had the career she had hoped for. Her press agent
might say she was in 47 shows, but they were never on Broadway. In
``Peer Gynt,'' starring John Garfield, at the ANTA Playhouse, she
played ``A Greenclad Woman.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1971, Ms. Britton married Robert Gross, whom she calls ``the
love of my life.'' He encouraged her to go to college, and teased
her, when he was ill with cancer, that the moment he died she would
buy a memorial bench for him in Gramercy Park, which she did.
Thinking about him, Ms. Britton's eyes well up.
</P>
<P>
   The subject is changed.
</P>
<P>
   If Ms. Britton could live her life all over again, would she
strip?
</P>
<P>
   She thinks about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes,'' she says. ``But I would have a different view of it. I
would know it was a steppingstone. I'd not take it so personally,
what people said. I look at pictures of myself then. I should have
at least known I was pretty.''

COMMENTARY: NO MISTAKING TIMES SQUARE FOR TOKYO 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also NY-COLLAPSE-RDP, NY-COLLAPSE-RESTAURANT,
NY-COLLAPSE-CONDENAST) 
(bl) 
 By CLYDE HABERMAN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ While Times Square stumbled through one more chaotic
day, thoughts turned Thursday to another moment of urban breakdown.
That was 14 years ago in Tokyo, where a fire in an underground
tunnel destroyed a telephone exchange, wiping out service for more
than 800,000 residents in a part of the city called Setagaya.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, customers were upset by the disruption, which would
last for many days. New Yorkers have no monopoly on complaining,
appearances to the contrary notwithstanding.
</P>
<P>
   But it took the telephone company less than 24 hours to set up
banks of emergency phones all across Setagaya, each equipped with
lights, tables and a list of important numbers. Naturally, company
officials were out there apologizing like mad, because that's what
Japanese businesses do when things go wrong. Outside one bank whose
cash machines had been knocked out by the fire, executives bowed to
customers _ and directed them to the ATMs of competitors.
</P>
<P>
   OK, enough of traipsing down memory lane. Besides, comparisons
between cultures can go only so far. But after the elevator-tower
collapse at the Conde Nast building in Times Square, it was hard
not to think about Setagaya and how company officials immediately
accepted full responsibility for a disaster that was not of their
doing.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, consider the questions that have been raised about
whether Douglas Durst and Dan Tishman, respectively the developer
and the builder of the Conde Nast tower, moved quickly enough to
shoulder their responsibilities in a disaster that has disrupted
thousands of lives and cost midtown businesses bundles of money.
Some of those questions may not be fair, but they are being asked
just the same by many New Yorkers, including Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor, not one easily accused of being anti-developer,
clearly believes that the Durst and Tishman organizations were a
tad slow in offering compensation. Coincidentally or not, it was
only after he began to grouse in public that Durst and Tishman
personally issued a statement expressing sorrow that an elderly
woman had died and regret that so many lives had been turned upside
down.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like pulling teeth to get them to do something for the
businesses,'' a City Hall official said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani was similarly out front in 1996, flailing executives of
Trans World Airlines for insensitivity in taking too long to notify
grieving families after the crash of Flight 800. At the time, some
accused the mayor of showboating. But he was venting a frustration
that many felt, and feel once again in the less calamitous Conde
Nast mess. The frustration is rooted in a suspicion, widely held,
that the knee-jerk reaction of American business leaders is to
spend more time worrying how to deflect lawsuits than how to show
an anxious public that they truly care.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, as Japanese companies understand, the public needs to
have its collective hand held, and right away.
</P>
<P>
   Although not about to attack a mayor with a mile-wide vindictive
streak, the Durst and Tishman people say they are getting an unfair
rap.
</P>
<P>
   ``The gravity of the situation was not in the least bit
ignored,'' said Mortimer Matz, a spokesman for the Durst
Organization. ``Emergency work was going on 24 hours a day. The
enormity of what was going on, assessing what was going on and
dealing with the city and all the emergency agencies involved _ it
was an enormous agenda all taking place at one time.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one was ignoring responsibilities,'' he said, ``or ignoring
compassion for those whose lives were disrupted.''
</P>
<P>
   Similar points were made by Richard Kielar, a senior vice
president at Tishman Realty &AMP; Construction Co. At first, the main
focus was on the damaged tower, he said, and that allowed little
time for writing statements of regret. Besides, Kielar added, ``we
wanted to come up with a statement that was somewhat substantive,''
offering details about compensation along with remorse.
</P>
<P>
   No one suggests malice on the part of these businesses, not in
this space anyway. But nagging questions about how responsibility
was shouldered seem unlikely to fade soon.
</P>
<P>
   By the way, getting back to Setagaya, once the telephones were
working again, the company sent out platoons of employees. They
visited every house _ every single one _ bearing small gifts and
apologizing once more for the inconvenience. Don't bet on seeing
that in Times Square.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Republican leaders in the Senate have decided it
would be futile to push for a big tax cut this year, infuriating
conservatives in both the House and Senate who had hoped the
prospect of huge federal budget surpluses would lead to swift
passage of sweeping tax reductions, members of Congress and aides
said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The split within the party, which has been festering for months
and erupted during a closed-door meeting of Republican leaders on
Wednesday night, complicated and perhaps doomed efforts by the
party's tax-cutting wing to ram through an election-year tax
package that would set up a potent confrontation with congressional
Democrats and President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Republican aides said Senate leaders saw no prospect of passing
any big tax cut because doing so would require 60 votes, far more
than the party, which holds 55 seats, has any chance of mustering.
And they said the benefits of waging a symbolic fight were
outweighed by the risks, including the certainty that Clinton would
accuse them of risking Social Security's long-term health to give
tax cuts to the wealthy.
</P>
<P>
   House Republicans, who have been pushing for a tax cut of
historic magnitude as the nation enters a new era of fiscal health,
said on Thursday that they were intent on following through with
plans to vote in September on a tax reduction of as much as $700
billion over the next decade.
</P>
<P>
   Conservatives said a House vote might then force the Senate to
reconsider before Congress adjourns in October, and they expressed
optimism that Senate leaders might still change their minds. But
they admitted that the current lack of support from Senate leaders
clearly endangered their efforts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, the Senate's leadership is the weak link in the
drive for real tax cuts this year,'' said Sen. John Ashcroft,
R-Mo., who has been pressing the leadership for a big tax cut.
</P>
<P>
   Ashcroft said that it would be ``an egregious mistake'' for the
Senate to give up on a big tax cut this year. Doing so, he said,
would lead to disillusionment among Republican voters and cast into
doubt Republican efforts to keep control of the House.
</P>
<P>
   Both parties have been struggling for months to adapt their
politics and policies to the prospect of ever-larger budget
surpluses. But the battle over taxes has heated up just in the last
week, after the Congressional Budget Office more than doubled its
estimate of the surplus over the next decade.
</P>
<P>
   The budget office said the federal government would have a
surplus over the next decade of $1.55 trillion. Of that amount,
though, about $1.4 trillion would come from Social Security payroll
tax revenue in excess of what Social Security needs to pay current
benefits.
</P>
<P>
   But Republican leaders _ including Sens. William V. Roth Jr. of
Delaware, the chairman of the Finance Committee, and Pete Domenici
of New Mexico, the chairman of the Budget Committee _ feel that it
would be futile and politically unwise to try and pass a big tax
bill before Congress adjourns in early October, aides said.
</P>
<P>
   Any tax cut that dipped into the surplus would require Congress
to waive its current budget rules, a maneuver that would require 60
votes in the Senate, a hurdle that Republican have no hope of
overcoming, aides said. And they said there was a strong sense
within the Senate that dealing with Social Security should come
ahead of any major tax-cutting package that relied on the surplus.
Indeed, they said, the $700 billion, 10-year tax cut being
developed in the House relies on changes in the way the federal
government accounts for Social Security payroll tax revenue. The
change, they said, would limit the interest paid to the Social
Security trust fund, leaving Republicans all the more exposed to
Democratic attacks. Clinton has stepped up his warnings to
Republicans in the last week not to use any of the surplus for tax
cuts until Social Security has been fixed.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Republicans said they had not ruled out a modest tax cut,
of as much as $70 billion over five years, that would be paid for
by raising other taxes and trimming spending. But many
conservatives said that is far too little.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Congressional aides said Senate leaders listed a series of
reasons during Wednesday night's meeting why Republicans should not
push right now for a large-scale tax cut.
</P>
<P>
   House Speaker Newt Gingrich; Rep. John Kasich of Ohio, the
chairman of the Budget Committee, and other House leaders who were
present at the meeting have been pushing in recent days for
hundreds of billions of dollars in tax cuts over the next decade.
They said new surplus estimates from the Congressional Budget
Office make clear that the nation can save Social Security and
still have plenty of money left over for major tax reductions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not a single senator spoke up in favor of what the House is
doing,'' said a senior Republican aide who was present at the
meeting. ``They're nervous.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the other Republicans attending the meeting were Sens.
Trent Lott of Mississippi, the majority leader, Connie Mack of
Florida and Don Nickles of Oklahoma, and Reps. Dick Armey, Tom
DeLay and Bill Archer, all of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Several House Republicans said they still believed that the
Senate could be sold on the political and economic wisdom of a big
tax cut, especially if the House took the lead and passed a bill.
</P>
<P>
   Christina Martin, Gingrich's spokeswoman, said on Thursday that
the House leadership viewed the meeting as just the beginning of a
process that would lead to a major tax package. Gingrich has been
pressing in recent days for a plan that would cut taxes for many
two-income couples, reduce the capital gains and estate taxes and
provide tax breaks for the elderly.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were plenty of colorful exchanges,'' Ms. Martin said in
describing the meeting. But she added that Republicans were
``making progress towards a big tax cut,'' and that the session was
only ``the first meeting in a series of meetings.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Kasich defended his plan as protecting Social
Security while returning the surplus to taxpayers and insuring that
Washington does not use the excess money in coming years to
increase the size of government.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not surprised that some of my colleagues in the Senate are
not enthusiastic about this,'' Kasich said. ``This is the same U.S.
Senate that's not able to pass a spending cut bill.''
</P>
<P>
   But Kasich said congressional leaders are already on the verge
of spending some of the surplus, and that he would continue to
rally support from around the country to push through as big a tax
cut as possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``To take the surplus and increase the size of government
defeats the whole reason we came to power,'' Kasich said.

RESTAURATEUR FINDS SCAFFOLD MISHAP A RECIPE FOR DISASTER 
</HEADLINE>
  (With NY-COLLAPSE-RDP) 
(bl) 
 By ERIC ASIMOV    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Steve Chang's journey to Times Square has taken him
across three continents. Along the way, he has sold ice cream and
corned beef sandwiches and golf equipment. Always, he looked ahead
to the day he could open his own restaurant. And when that time
came, it never occurred to him to look up.
</P>
<P>
   But the twisted elevator tower and scaffolding that collapsed
Tuesday from the Conde Nast building in Times Square threatens
Chang's dream. Just two weeks ago, he had opened Rio de Janeiro, an
extravagant all-you-can-eat churrascaria, where waiters
theatrically paraded dozens of cuts of meat, and customers dined
until they dropped.
</P>
<P>
   He had advertised his restaurant in New York magazine and in
Playbill, assuming that his address, 127 W. 43rd St., situated him
perfectly to capitalize on the surge of tourism that has made Times
Square one of the busiest neighborhoods in the city.
</P>
<P>
   Instead it made him a victim of what the insurance companies
dispassionately call a ``business interruption.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We were gaining momentum, people were calling and starting to
make reservations,'' Chang said. ``Then _ boom _ this thing
happened.''
</P>
<P>
   The boom came about 8:25 a.m. Tuesday, just as Chang's
brother-in-law, Jong Ik Rhee, was approaching the restaurant to
open it for the day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw the construction workers running out of the site and the
elevator move to the side,'' Rhee said in Korean as his daughter,
So Jung Rhee, translated. ``It was chaotic. After everything had
fallen, I saw that a window had been broken and the canopy broken
as well.''
</P>
<P>
   Rhee was forced by construction workers and police to retreat
down the street. Nobody has been in the restaurant since, leaving
Chang with no access to his office and to what he estimates to be
tens of thousands of dollars worth of food with nobody to cook it
or eat it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a lot of food getting spoiled,'' he said. ``I have no
way to call my workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``How am I feeling? I want to cry, but what can you do?''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most frustrating thing for Chang has been getting
information. Thursday, he remained unsure when 43rd Street would
open again. ``I don't know if this'll be resolved in days or
weeks,'' he said. ``I've heard that the street may not be opened
for many weeks, and that's discouraging.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, his workers _ including his own daughter, Joanne, who
is the restaurant's general manager _ are not getting paid, and
Chang worries about the rent, which he would only say was ``big
money.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now I'm calling my creditors and vendors to hold off
payments for a month or two until I can get money from my insurance
people,'' he said. ``I even had to call my mortgage company to give
me a couple of months. What else can I do? I have no way to make a
living.''
</P>
<P>
   Chang said his insurance covers him for business interruptions,
and that he is looking to the developer, the Durst Organization,
and the general contractor, Tishman Construction, for help.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure I have the policy for this type of situation,'' he
said. ``We're hoping Mr. Tishman and Mr. Durst will somehow
expedite the compensation,'' he added, speaking of John Tishman and
Douglas Durst.
</P>
<P>
   Chang's neighbor on 43rd Street, Bruce Sterman, was less
sanguine. Sterman and his wife, Luba Pincus, own the Manhattan
Chili Company on 43rd east of Broadway, and Tuesday's accident was
the second time this year the restaurant was forced to close
because of construction problems at the Conde Nast building. On
Jan. 26, a crane collapsed, which forced the restaurant to close
for half a day and required sidewalk scaffolding for a month.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our business had a clear 20 percent drop as a result of being
entombed in a sidewalk shed for a full four weeks,'' he said. ``We
were not insured for that.''
</P>
<P>
   Sterman said he was bitter about what he called the ``wiggling
and waggling'' on the part of the insurance and construction
companies, which he said were trying to avoid responsibility for
the problem earlier this year, and he said he feared getting the
runaround again. He said lawsuits would be a last resort.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are people that are in my neighborhood; they're my
customers,'' said Sterman, who estimated he is losing $8,000 to
$9,000 a day while closed. ``I don't really want to sue them, but
they have forced me into that position. I've just been kicked
around by these big companies and they're starting again.''
</P>
<P>
   Chang, who was born in South Korea and worked in Paraguay and
Brazil before moving to New York in 1979, said he was most
concerned about people: those who had made reservations at the
270-seat Rio de Janeiro and his staff of more than 50. If he could
reach his workers, he said, he would tell them that they ought to
seek other work because he did not know how long the restaurant
would be closed. ``I can always hire them back when the situation
is back to normal,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He did not include his daughter, Joanne, among this number,
though. He has put her to work organizing a satellite office at his
home in Riverdale, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Chang says it will be difficult. ``I'm very stressed, I have
absolutely no income,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Chang's response? ``I'm just asking her if I can delay
payment,'' he said.

CANIZARES FEARS CLUBS STOLEN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ERIC NOLAND  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Missing luggage.
</P>
<P>
   It's usually no more than a nuisance for most travelers. For
Jose Maria Canizares, a professional golfer who was gearing up for
the most important tournament on the Senior PGA Tour, it had more
the feel of disaster.
</P>
<P>
   Canizares, sixth on the money list this year, was forced to play
the first round of the U.S. Senior Open with borrowed clubs
Thursday at Riviera Country Club after his bag disappeared on a
trip here Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very bad mistake, because it's a very personal
thing,'' Canizares said after shooting an opening round of
2-over-par 73.
</P>
<P>
   When he got to the baggage carousel at LAX after his flight from
Chicago, all of his bags were there except the one carrying his
clubs, Canizares said. He since has been in constant touch with
American Airlines, but he has been told efforts to find the clubs
have been futile. He fears they were stolen in the baggage-claim
area.
</P>
<P>
   ``I look in Los Angeles airport, and it is very bad control,''
said Canizares, a Spaniard. ``Everybody comes in from the street,
and there are no police. Nobody to say, `Where are you going?' You
could get any bag you like.''
</P>
<P>
   He was given a replacement set of clubs by Ping, the
manufacturer with which he is under contract, but ``everything is
new. They feel different.''
</P>
<P>
   Canizares added, ``This could cost me $1 million. It's not the
(monetary value of the clubs). It's personal. You can't replace
them. This is my job. I don't play golf for holiday.''

PEPSICO MULLS CONVERSION OF BOTTLING OPERATIONS 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By CONSTANCE L. HAYS    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Pepsico on Thursday made its second major move this week to
become a fiercer competitor to Coca-Cola Co., saying it was
studying the possible conversion of some bottling operations into a
separate publicly traded company.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement by Pepsico chairman and chief executive Roger
Enrico was seen by analysts as confirmation that the No. 2
soft-drink company planned to create a major national bottler
similar to Coca-Cola Enterprises, the largest bottler in Coca-Cola
Co.'s system, which handles about 65 percent of Coke's volume in
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``Structuring our bottling system to serve the needs of our
retail customers and our shareholders is a critical part of our
long-term growth strategy,'' Enrico said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   His announcement came three days after Pepsi announced it was
buying the Tropicana juice business from Seagram Co. for $3.3
billion, which would put Pepsi into direct competition with Coke's
Minute Maid brands.
</P>
<P>
   By creating its own separate bottling system, 12 years after
Coca-Cola Enterprises was formed, Pepsi could considerably improve
its efficiency in the soft-drink competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our research has shown that Pepsi's fragmented bottler network
has been the key issue in terms of Pepsi's recent performance and
market share versus Coca-Cola,'' said Bill Pecoriello, a beverage
analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein &AMP; Co., an investment research
firm. The company's bottlers in the United States handled about 57
percent of the soft-drink volume sold domestically, said Emanuel
Goldman, an analyst with Paine Webber.
</P>
<P>
   Bottling is a capital-intensive business, with smaller profit
margins than concentrate sales, as Pepsico's numbers show. The
bottling holdings generate $7.156 billion in annual revenue,
Goldman estimated, while the pretax profit is $807 million. The
company's concentrate business _ the syrup it sells to bottlers _
generates $1.122 billion, he estimated, with profits before taxes
of $588 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'll have a more effective operation if you have a separate
company going up against Coke Enterprises,'' Goldman said.
</P>
<P>
   Enrico was not available to comment Thursday. But analysts said
it was clear that a bottling spinoff was part of a strategy to
challenge Coke much more aggressively on several fronts. Just two
months ago, Pepsi accused Coke in a lawsuit of using illegal
tactics to dominate the fountain soft-drink business. Last year
Pepsi spun off its restaurants to concentrate on its core business.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you couple this with the Tropicana deal, the restaurant
spinoff and the recent litigation, it's clear that Roger has
Pepsico in overdrive right now,'' said John Sicher, publisher of
Beverage Digest, an industry newsletter.

APPEALS COURT PANEL UPHOLDS PRUDENTIAL INSURANCE SETTLEMENT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.J., Pa.)  (af) 
 By DIANA B. HENRIQUES    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   A federal appeals court panel in Philadelphia has upheld a huge
class-action settlement between the Prudential Insurance Company of
America and millions of its customers who had been sold unnecessary
life insurance by Prudential agents over a 13-year period ending in
1995.
</P>
<P>
   The settlement had been approved in March 1997 by Judge Alfred
Wolin of the federal district court in Newark, N.J., but lawyers
for some of the 10.7 million affected policyholders objected to the
settlement and sought to overturn it in the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court
of Appeals.
</P>
<P>
   In a decision released Thursday, the appeals panel rejected
those objections and affirmed the basic terms of the settlement,
which calls for Prudential to repay an estimated $2 billion to
customers through direct refunds and enhancements to existing
policies.
</P>
<P>
   But the court did not approve the lower court's award of about
$90 million in legal fees. Instead, it ordered the trial court to
re-examine whether the fees accurately represented contributions
the lawyers had made to the ultimate settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Melvyn Weiss, the lead lawyer for the policyholders, said his
team ``feels very secure'' that the fees would withstand the
additional examination.
</P>
<P>
   The settlement had been the subject of extensive negotiations
involving not only Prudential and its customers, but also insurance
regulators in 30 states.
</P>
<P>
   Prudential had agreed in early 1997 to pay a fine of $35 million
to settle state allegations of deceptive sales practices. The life
insurance giant, based in Newark, has acknowledged that for more
than a decade its agents had improperly persuaded customers to cash
in old policies and purchase new ones so that the agents could
generate additional sales commissions _ a practice known as
churning.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are gratified that the court has upheld the class-action
settlement,'' said Robert DeFillippo, a spokesman for Prudential.
``The court has affirmed that the settlement will provide complete,
fair and equitable remedies to policyholders.'' The company has
begun to review claims under the settlement, DeFillippo said,
despite the uncertainty posed by the appeals process.
</P>
<P>
   To date, 500,000 of its customers have applied for basic claim
relief, which entitles them to get enhancements to various
financial products offered by Prudential. Another 640,000 people
have notified the company that they believe they were misled, and
are entitled to additional compensation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have started the review of those claims and have started
sending out checks,'' DeFillippo said Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   Prudential had set aside $2 billion in reserves to cover the
costs of the settlement.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling was greeted with dismay by Michael Weaver, a former
Prudential employee who has been an advocate of policyholders in
the dispute. Weaver, who maintains a World Wide Web site devoted to
the case, said that he had received numerous messages from
policyholders complaining about the difficulties they have
encountered in submitting claims.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the process was flawed at the inception, and has been
skewed to relieve Prudential of their responsibility to their
policyholders, the very people who owned'' the company, Weaver said
Thursday night.

   USA's Miller auditions &QL; 
through European play
</P>
<P>
   &UR; By EDDIE SEFKO &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
ROME _ Brad Miller has a lot to gain by playing for the U.S. team
in the FIBA World Championship of Basketball _ mostly because he
stands to lose a lot in the NBA's labor stoppage.
</P>
<P>
   So he has this suggestion for leaders of the players union and
league bosses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Three words,'' he said. ``Fargo, North Dakota. Those people
don't know which way they want to go. I mean, they send the players
to Hawaii for their labor meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Send them somewhere crummy. That way, they'll want to get it
over fast. If you send them to Hawaii every time, they'll have a
meeting every week. Send them to Fargo, N.D., and they'll be done
in a day. Instead, it's go meet for half an hour, then sit in the
sun and go to luaus. Go to Fargo, and there's nothing to do but sit
in a room and get it over with.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller knows it's not that easy to solve a labor crisis in the
NBA. But it's a good point.
</P>
<P>
   And it's players like him who stand to lose perhaps more than
anybody else in the labor dispute, assuming it isn't solved
quickly. Because he cannot work out for any NBA teams during the
summer, the 6-11 center out of Purdue would be stuck waiting for
the lockout to end, then hoping to latch on with a team as a free
agent.
</P>
<P>
   That is, if it weren't for the fact Miller's options opened up
considerably for the same reason his NBA dream is on hold. As a
member of the U.S. team, Miller stands to gain from the tournament
by his exposure in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Undrafted a month ago by the NBA, Miller has become one of the
Americans' surprise leaders. He looked good in the first two
exhibition games in Monte Carlo, Monaco, showing his ability to
coaches of the French and Spanish national teams and to countless
European scouts. He hit all five of his shots against France and
probably was the best player on the court. Against Spain, his
playing time was reduced to give teammates a chance, but he was a
force on the floor.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, the U.S. team has an exhibition game against Italy,
providing another forum where Miller can show his stuff. After
that, there is the 10-day run in Athens, Greece, for the World
Championship of Basketball.
</P>
<P>
   And because of the muddled NBA labor situation, Europeans
probably ought to get used to Miller. The way he sees it, he's
basically trying out for a job in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll probably come overseas for a while because with the
lockout, it's hard to do anything else,'' Miller said. ``You can't
play. So basically, you have to work out on your own, which I'm
going to do. But I'll probably go overseas and get a contract where
I can play until the lockout is over and then leave. That way, I
can get some experience over here playing against professionals And
you get time to really work on your own game because there's some
free time over here. There's no point in spending money working out
when you can make money working out.''
</P>
<P>
   None of this would have been necessary if Miller had been
drafted. Many scouts believe he has the sort of talent that should
have had him taken early in the second round, especially
considering the shortage of quality big men in the NBA. Miller said
he was surprised he wasn't drafted.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish I knew what happened,'' he said. ``I really don't know.
But it's been working out so far, getting a chance to play on this
team after not getting drafted. I just don't let it drag me down. I
just look back and see that nobody drafted me and try to go out and
prove every time on the court why I should have been drafted.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller admitted he had high hopes before the draft.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had one team in particular tell me they were going to take
me with a certain pick or, if not, trade up to get me,'' he said.
``There were a few teams like that. But after a certain number of
picks, I quit watching the draft anyway.''

OFF TRACK, JAYS NEED A LIFT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LARRY WHITESIDE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ When the season started, first-year manager Tim Johnson
had the highest of hopes for his Toronto Blue Jays. But unless they
do more than bumble along at a .500 pace, all Johnson can look
forward to is a rebuilding plan that could start as early as next
week.
</P>
<P>
   A stroll through the visitors' clubhouse at Fenway Park Thursday
revealed that this was not the same club that entered the season
considered a prime contender. Suddenly, a four-game series in the
third week of July has become crucial because the Blue Jays came to
town with a 51-51 record, trailing the Red Sox by 7 1/2 games in
the American League wild-card hunt.
</P>
<P>
   Toronto had won only five of 14 games since the All-Star break.
Sure, Roger Clemens (12-6) is on a roll reminiscent of his Cy Young
form in his Toronto debut last season, and Woody Williams and Pat
Hentgen have nine wins each. But it simply hasn't been happening
for the Blue Jays, who offensively and defensively have been below
expectations all year.
</P>
<P>
   The magnitude of this series was reflected in the crowd that
quickly gathered around Clemens, who on Wednesday night had pitched
eight shutout innings in a 4-0 victory over the White Sox. Rumors
had surfaced that he would start Sunday in place of Hentgen, the
1997 AL Cy Young winner. They proved to be inaccurate, which saved
a lot of clubhouse grief. But there are a lot of people in Toronto
who wouldn't have been surprised if Clemens had been slotted
opposite Pedro Martinez in a duel of Cy Young defenders. The Blue
Jays need a shakeup.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's speculation,'' said Johnson of the possibility. ``That's
all it ever was, speculation. As for our record, it comes down to
one or two things. The pitching has been good, but the defense
hasn't been as good as we'd want it to be. The hitting has been up
and down. We hope to be closer. We're not. You can't dwell on it.
You have to go out there and keep fighting.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, the former Boston bench coach, knows the buck stops
with him, so he wasn't ducking issues. Yes, he said, it was a
temptation to pitch Clemens on three days' rest. But conventional
wisdom dictates strict adherence to the rotation, if possible. So
even though Clemens threw only 100 pitches Wednesday, Hentgen will
pitch Sunday. Clemens will next pitch Tuesday against Texas,
another wild-card contender.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll stick with the rotation,'' said Johnson. ``They've been
doing a good job. So has the bullpen. I'm always optimistic.
Naturally, we'd like to win more games. But we need to be more
consistent.''
</P>
<P>
   Clemens didn't want to be a part of any controversy when he
reached Fenway. He'd much rather talk about one of his sons, Koby,
playing in a national tournament in Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   Physically, he said, he could go on three days' rest. But
realistically, the time is not right.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pitching is not our problem right now,'' said Clemens.
``Besides, that's Pat Hentgen's day. He's a Cy Young winner, too.
If this were September, I would lean to a four-man (rotation) if we
needed that. But we have five capable guys and a guy throwing well
at Triple A in Kelvim Escobar.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're still playing .500 baseball, which is not good enough
for much right now. We got to do something different if we hope to
remain in contention for the wild card. We're pulling for all the
other guys. We got to keep Pat's confidence up and we've got to
score some runs somehow for (Juan) Guzman. He's been throwing so
well and hasn't got much to show for it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Blue Jays know that catching runaway division leader New
York is a foolish notion. But unless there is a major turnaround,
the club will finish closer to fifth than first, and that's
unacceptable.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know there is a lot of room for improvement,'' said
Johnson. ``We're not just pointing to this series. We're trying to
win all the games. The pressure isn't only because we're here right
now. It doesn't matter who it's against. Whether it's Boston, the
Yankees, the White Sox, you still want to get as many victories as
you can.''

JURY CONVICTS ONE AND ACQUITS ANOTHER IN PLOT TO BOMB SUBWAY 
</HEADLINE>
  (af) 
 By JOSEPH P. FRIED    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A Palestinian immigrant who testified that he had
wanted to kill as many Jews as possible in a suicide attack was
convicted Thursday of plotting to explode a powerful pipe bomb in
the New York City subway.
</P>
<P>
   But in a case that raised the specter of another terrorist
attack in a city where the World Trade Center was bombed five years
ago, the jury in federal district court in Brooklyn acquitted a
second defendant of charges that he had been part of the
conspiracy, instead finding him guilty only of an
immigration-related fraud charge.
</P>
<P>
   The bombing plot, which was aborted in a police raid last July
with possibly only hours to spare, involved a nail-studded
explosive that the authorities said would have burst into hundreds
or thousands of streaking metal shards that could have killed
scores of people had it detonated as planned.
</P>
<P>
   After the jury pronounced Ghazi Ibrahim Abu Maizar guilty of
conspiring to use a weapon of mass destruction, he exclaimed at the
defense table: ``Palestinian children do not deserve to die! Nobody
in the world deserves to die!''
</P>
<P>
   Then, jumping up from his seat, Abu Maizar, 24, who was born in
Hebron, on the West Bank, when the city was still under Israeli
occupation, shouted ``Allah akhbar!'' _ ``God is great'' in Arabic
_ and held a copy of the Koran over his head before federal
marshals forced him back into his seat.
</P>
<P>
   Abu Maizar, a slightly built, bearded man _ wearing a Muslim
skullcap he had worn only irregularly during the three-week trial _
then pointed upward with the index fingers of both hands and
appeared to be murmuring prayers. During the trial, he accused
Israel of oppressing Palestinians and also denounced the United
States' support for Israel.
</P>
<P>
   His co-defendant, Lafi Khalil, 23, also born in the West Bank,
simply buried his face in his hands as he learned that the jury
acquitted him of charges related to the bomb plot, but convicted
him of possessing a bogus alien registration document.
</P>
<P>
   Abu Maizar now faces a sentence of life in prison. The
immigration charge Khalil was convicted of is normally punishable
by up to 10 years in prison, but prosecution and defense lawyers
said it could bring a sentence of up to 25 years in this case if
the judge finds that Khalil used it to further a terrorist plot, a
judicial finding that is possible despite the jury's acquittal of
Khalil on charges in the bomb plot.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators in the United States have said they had found no
evidence linking the defendants to any known terrorist group. And
the Israeli government has said that the men _ who came to the
United States separately and met several months before they were
arrested _ were not known to have ties to militant groups, although
Abu Maizar was arrested as a teen-ager in 1990 for throwing stones
at Israeli soldiers during Palestinian protests.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Reena Raggi set sentencing for Oct. 23.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   After the verdict, following nearly 10 hours of jury
deliberations over two days, Khalil's lawyer, Bruce McIntyre,
praised the jury's acquittal of his client on the bombing
conspiracy charges as ``an absolutely wonderful job.''
</P>
<P>
   ``All along we've maintained that he didn't know about what was
going on,'' McIntyre said. He had argued to the jury that despite
being arrested with Abu Maizar in the apartment where the bomb was
found _ and despite a snapshot showing Khalil with pipe parts and
wire like those later found in the device _ his client had not been
involved in the plot. Among other things, the lawyer argued, his
client's fingerprints had not been found on any of the evidence in
the case.
</P>
<P>
   Khalil's father, Taysir Khalil, who had come from his home in
Amman, Jordan, for his son's trial, said through an interpreter
outside the downtown Brooklyn courthouse, ``I know my son is not
guilty, and is innocent, from the first day, and I know there is a
fair law in the United States of America.''
</P>
<P>
   A lawyer for Abu Maizar, Michael Padden, said that ``given what
transpired in the courtroom, we can't say we're shocked'' by the
verdict against his client.
</P>
<P>
   He was referring to Abu Maizar's testimony _ against the advice
of his lawyers _ that he had planned to set off the bomb in a
suicide attack in which he hoped to kill as many Jews as possible,
though he insisted that the bombing was not to have taken place in
the subway.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the trial, Padden and his co-counsel, Jan Rostal,
maintained that Abu Maizar had not intended to explode the device,
but rather had built it for use as a prop in a fuzzy plot to
defraud a government antiterrorism program of reward money. &QL;

IRANIANS RETURN TO U.S., READY TO JUST WRESTLE 
</HEADLINE>
  (cb) 
 By TARIK EL-BASHIR    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Less than four months after members of the Iranian
national wrestling team were photographed, fingerprinted and
detained at O'Hare Airport in Chicago when they arrived for a
tournament, they returned to the United States on Wednesday night
for this weekend's competition at the Goodwill Games.
</P>
<P>
   This time there was no red tape, no need for a public
explanation of customs procedure by the Clinton administration.
Instead, a State Department official and a former Iranian team
coach met the athletes and escorted them through customs and
promptly took them to the team's hotel in midtown Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the incident at O'Hare last April, the Iranians placed
third at the 1998 Freestyle World Cup competition at Oklahoma State
University. The current trip is the latest chapter in a run of
recent athletic competition between the two countries. Last month,
Iran scored a stirring victory over the United States in the World
Cup soccer tournament in France.
</P>
<P>
   Leading the list of Iranian athletes wrestling in the four-team
competition this weekend is Rasul Khadem, who won a gold medal at
the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta and was the world champion in 1994 and
1995 in the 198-pound weight class. He will be competing against
athletes from Russia and Turkey as well as from the United States
on Saturday and Sunday at the Theater at Madison Square Garden.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Khadem and his teammate Abbas Jadidi, who was
runner-up in the 220-pound class in Atlanta, were welcomed by their
former coach, Hamid Kermanshah, at Kermanshah's Oriental rug
gallery in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   It marked just the fifth time since 1979 that an Iranian
athletic team has visited the United States, according to Goodwill
Games officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was surprising how open they were to coming back to America
after what happened to them in Chicago,'' said Kermanshah, who
coached the Iranian team in the early 1990's. ``They told me they
were forgetting about it, and it was time to turn the page on that
incident.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``Maybe things like this can open the dialogue between
the countries. Maybe their coming here can help in some way.''
</P>
<P>
   At the gallery, Khadem and Jadidi signed autographs for about a
dozen Iranian fans and politely sidestepped any discussion about
politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are focused on wrestling,'' Khadem said through Kermanshah,
who translated. ``We have come only for the games and for the
sportsmanship. I hope I can do the best for my country.''
</P>
<P>
   Last February, 10 members of the U.S. wrestling team traveled to
Tehran to compete in the prestigious Takhti Cup. It was the first
time in 20 years that an American team had competed on Iranian
soil. The Americans plan to return to Iran in September for the
world championships in Tehran. &QL;

TRIBUTE TO BABE RUTH IS `MOST WONDERFUL,' HIS DAUGHTER SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
  (cb) 
 By RICHARD SANDOMIR    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   She celebrated her 81st birthday last week, but when Julia Ruth
Stevens reminisces about her father, she sounds 18. She smiles in a
dreamy way about Babe Ruth and clasps her hands over her heart when
she speaks of ``Daddy.'' There were tears in her eyes as she looked
out at an audience that had been invited to screen HBO's ``Babe
Ruth'' documentary Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the most wonderful tribute to my father that I've ever
seen,'' she said of the film that will air at 8 p.m. Eastern time
on Aug. 16, the anniversary of the Babe's death.
</P>
<P>
   Stevens' son, Tom, an engineer, was in the audience. So were
Yankees Manager Joe Torre and pitchers Graeme Lloyd and David
Wells, a Ruth devotee.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was the luckiest girl in the world to have him as a
father,'' Julia Stevens said. She was Claire Hodgson's daughter
from her first marriage. The Babe adopted her when he married
Claire in 1929. At a reception following the film, she offered fond
memories: her father surprising her by coming to her high school
graduation in 1934; walking her down the aisle at her wedding, and
traveling with her parents on a tour of Japan after the 1934
season.
</P>
<P>
   Recalling the blood transfusion her father gave her, she said
her thought was, ``Wow, now I have his blood in me.'' It could have
happened yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was always there when I needed him,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
   She tried to dispel any notion that her father was something of
a wild man at home. ``He only rarely raised his voice, but if he
did, if he said `Julia!' you knew he was mad,'' she said. ``He was
like any father. Oh, he'd let out a belly laugh, of course. We
listened to the radio together. We loved `The Lone Ranger.' We
played bridge. He was good. He was a very good golfer.''
</P>
<P>
   She said she substituted for her mother as her father's
companion at various events around town, ``because I loved the way
people reacted to him.''
</P>
<P>
   And although she said she loved the HBO documentary for digging
up unseen archival footage and clips from the Babe's silent films,
she nonetheless endured old and new tales about her father's
excessive good times with food, booze and sex. She heard the
journalist Heywood Hale Broun relate a tale about Ruth's romp with
``multiple female partners,'' and Charlie Devens recall the Babe
downing a quart of scotch on a Boston-to-New York train ride.
</P>
<P>
   ``A quart of scotch? That's an awful lot,'' she said. ``It seems
exaggerated.''
</P>
<P>
   Then she said, ``I learned a lot tonight, but some of it I take
with a grain of salt. She said she finds solace in her belief that
the Babe's allegedly prodigious sexual exploits ``happened before
he married my mother.''
</P>
<P>
   Julia had a sister, Dorothy, probably born in 1921, when Ruth
was married to Helen Woodford. Her birth was something of a
mystery, according to accounts. The HBO film speculates that her
mother was not Helen, but a maid.
</P>
<P>
   Did Ruth love having daughters? ``Oh, sure,'' she said. ``But he
would have loved a son.'' She nodded toward her son, who was born
in 1952. ``But he would have loved my son. I know he would have
loved Tom.''
</P>
<P>
   Chuck Doehler was at the screening, too, because of a cameo role
he plays in the HBO film. Doehler was 14, one of 200 Babe Ruth
League players who traveled by bus to see Ruth's coffin at Yankee
Stadium nearly 50 years ago. But traffic delayed them and when they
arrived, the gate was closed. Only the family, some reporters and
photographers were left, preparing for the funeral procession.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow, Doehler said, Claire Ruth heard that the 200 youngsters
wanted to get in, but could not. The gate was opened. ``I was at
the head of the line,'' said Doehler, who would later be an
assistant baseball coach at Seton Hall.
</P>
<P>
   ``Someone gave me a ball that had `Safe at home' written on
it.'' Doehler approached the open coffin nervously and placed the
ball inside. But it rolled down Ruth's left arm. ``Then I placed it
on his clasped hands,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He said he recalled Claire Ruth telling him, ``It's so wonderful
of you to go to this trouble,'' as she led him to an open gate
where a hearse awaited.
</P>
<P>
   Doehler said the experience galvanized his love of baseball. He
signed a minor league contract with the Boston Braves. And in 1952,
one of his roommates at the YMCA in Eau Claire, Wis., was Henry
Aaron. &QL;

MOTHER OF FUGITIVE WANTED IN RAPES SAYS HE TALKED OF SUICIDE 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Convicted rapist and fugitive Steven B. Gordon, wanted for three
rapes of women in New Hampshire this month, remained at large
Thursday, despite efforts by the FBI and Dutch authorities to find
him in Amsterdam, where he was last believed to have been.
</P>
<P>
   Court documents obtained Thursday, meanwhile, show that even
though Gordon was not supposed to be released early from prison
unless he attended an in-prison sex-offender program, he never took
part in the program because it was only for pedophiles.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, New Hampshire Superior Court Judge Linda S. Dalianis,
who originally sentenced him to six to 15 years in 1993 for the
rape of a New Hampshire teacher, let him out on parole in 1997 so
he could attend outpatient counseling at a sexual offenders clinic
in Tyngsborough, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   The Globe was unable to determine whether Gordon ever
participated in the Massachusetts program. Dalianis, who was
appointed to the bench in 1980, declined to comment on Gordon or
his case.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon, 28, a native of Quincy, Mass., is wanted by New
Hampshire authorities for the rapes of two Irish women in
Portsmouth, N.H., last Saturday, and of a Nashua, N.H. Realtor in a
house in Manchester July 7.
</P>
<P>
   At a press conference Thursday afternoon, Portsmouth Commander
Brad Russ said police ``hope to have him in custody in the very
near future.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have information coming to us every hour about a possible
location on this individual,'' Russ said. He said Portsmouth
detectives had tracked Gordon to Amsterdam, and are filing
paperwork with federal officials to allow extradition if Gordon is
found.
</P>
<P>
   However, Gordon's mother, who asked that her name not be used,
said she talked to her son at about noon Eastern time Thursday, and
he told her he was outside of an embassy in Amsterdam attempting to
secure a visa that would allow him to flee the Netherlands. She
declined to identify the embassy.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon also talked of suicide, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, `I think I am going to kill myself,''' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Manchester, N.H. police told the Globe Thursday that they have
now named Gordon as a suspect in the rape of the Realtor. Detective
Dan Brennan said comments Gordon made to his probation officer
``heightened our attention on him as a suspect.'' He did not say
when Gordon made those comments to his probation officer.
</P>
<P>
   Brennan said he did not believe police had made any contact with
Gordon yet. ``We are basically waiting, hoping that someone gets
through to him to get him to turn himself in,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In an emotional telephone conversation Wednesday evening, a man
who said he was Gordon confessed to all three rapes to a Globe
reporter, saying he had felt out of control and apologizing to the
women.
</P>
<P>
   The Globe notified Portsmouth police Wednesday night that it was
reporting the next morning that Gordon had confessed to the rapes
and said he was at a youth hostel in Amsterdam. The paper also gave
police the phone number of the hostel.
</P>
<P>
   Although it is the newspaper's policy not to share information
it has gathered before it is published, the paper decided that
concern for public safety took precedence. The Globe did not
disclose any other information to the police, and did not violate
any agreement with sources for the story.
</P>
<P>
   At her house in a Boston suburb, Gordon's mother Thursday showed
a Globe reporter a pellet gun wrapped in cloth, which she said her
son told her he used in robberies he had committed. At first she
denied that he told her that he used the gun in the rapes as well,
but later she said he had.
</P>
<P>
   The black plastic gun, which resembled a .45 automatic, bore the
words ``Crosman Airgun.'' Removing it from under the cushions of a
plush chair in her living room, Gordon's mother said, ``He said it
was the gun he used.'' She said Gordon gave the weapon to his
brother, who lives with her, this month as a birthday present.
</P>
<P>
   At the kitchen table of her yellow ranch-style home, Gordon's
mother alternately cried and raised her voice as she talked to a
reporter. By her side was a white cordless phone from which, she
said, she urges her fugitive son to turn himself in whenever he
calls. Gordon has been diagnosed with a mental illness, she said,
and needs professional help.
</P>
<P>
   His mother said he had recently stopped taking two medications:
Lithium, which is used to treat manic depression, and Zoloft, an
antidepressant.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a monster inside him that needs to be killed,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   She leafed through a yellowed photo album of her six children,
frozen in the innocence of youth. Gordon is pictured throughout his
life, playing, wading in the ocean, stiffly posing at a wedding.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love looking at this album,'' she said, tears welling. ``It
makes me happy ... This is my whole life. It's not much of a life,
is it?''

COLLAPSE OF TOWER IS HURTING HIT SHOWS

<P>
   NEW YORK _ While New Yorkers continued to cope with the
disruption caused by the collapse of an elevator tower on Tuesday
in Times Square, four major productions, including the popular
``Cabaret,'' were coping with more: financially onerous shutdowns
of successful shows.
</P>
<P>
   Most prominent and imperiled is ``Cabaret,'' whose location at
the Kit Kat Klub on 43rd Street, a few steps from the accident site
at the Conde Nast building, left producers contemplating a shutdown
that could easily last another week or more.
</P>
<P>
   Officials with the Roundabout Theater Company, the producers of
``Cabaret,'' said they still had no official word on how long the
show, which won four Tony Awards, would be shut down. It had been
playing to full houses almost since its opening on Feb. 13 and was
grossing close to $300,000 a week.
</P>
<P>
   City officials said two other nearby theaters closed in the
aftermath of the collapse, the Criterion and the Lamb's, could
reopen soon _ as soon as a 700-foot-tall black nylon net is
installed to enclose the damaged scaffolding and protect the
streets below. But because of its location, almost beneath the
scaffolding, the Kit Kat Klub could be closed much longer.
</P>
<P>
   Officials with the Roundabout said an extended shutdown of
``Cabaret'' would be both financially and psychologically
devastating, leaving the theater scrambling to pay the cast and
perhaps denying farewell performances to the two most prominent
female performers, who had already been scheduled to leave the
production.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a disaster for us, heading toward a catastrophe in
another week or so,'' Todd Haimes, artistic director of the
Roundabout, said. ``We still have to pay the costs of mounting a
production, even if we're not actually performing. Let's face it.
It's so rare to have a success like this, that to have it and then
be shut down, is just devastating.''
</P>
<P>
   Haimes said it cost $210,000 a week to stage ``Cabaret, which
has 20 cast members, some of whom play musical instruments, and
seven orchestra members who do not appear as actors.
</P>
<P>
   Moving the show to another theater temporarily is not even an
option, given the difficulty of finding a suitable spot and the
expense of moving. As it is, ``Cabaret'' takes place in what used
to be the Club Expo; it was specifically refurbished as a
Weimar-era nightclub, with many theatergoers sitting at tables in
the play's cafe.
</P>
<P>
   Two other Roundabout productions, ``You Never Can Tell'' and
``Side Man,'' have been closed at the Criterion, 1530 Broadway near
45th Street. Since both shows are part of subscription series with
a limited run, it will be difficult to recoup lost costs, Haimes
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Side Man,'' about one man's obsession with jazz and its
effects on his family and friends, had been taking in about
$160,000 a week. ``You Never Can Tell,'' George Bernard Shaw's play
about an independent-thinking woman visiting a British seaside
resort, was taking in about $120,000.
</P>
<P>
   Less conspicuous, but also shut down, has been ``Smoke On the
Mountain,'' an offbeat Southern musical review, at the Lamb's
Theater, 130 W. 44th St.
</P>
<P>
   Carolyn Rossi Copeland, the producer, said the show, which
opened June 18, had been steadily building an audience, was
expecting its best week and was planning to film television
commercials next week. She said the show was playing at more than
60 percent of the theater's 350-seat capacity.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have two sold-out houses for next week,'' she said. ``This
is just killing us. The margin for a little show like this is very
small, and we're eating it up by the hour.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   There is never a good time for productions to be shut down, but
the timing of this week's disruption was particularly painful,
officials with the show said.
</P>
<P>
   And ``Smoke on the Mountain,'' which was first produced eight
years ago and has been touring the country for much of the time
since, is considered especially well suited for the summer tourist
trade.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cabaret,'' based on Christopher Isherwood's writings about the
decadence of Germany at the dawning of the Third Reich, has been
one of the hottest plays on Broadway for some time; it became even
more popular after its strong showing in the Tony Awards.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday was supposed to be the last performance for Mary Louise
Wilson, who played the role of Fraulein Schneider. She is being
replaced by Blair Brown. And Natasha Richardson, who won a Tony for
her performance as Sally Bowles, is scheduled to leave the play
Aug. 2, with Jennifer Jason Leigh taking her place.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are Natasha's last two weeks,'' Haimes said. ``It would
be tragic if she doesn't get to finish her run.''
</P>
<P>
   Haimes said that although he would like more definitive answers,
city officials seem to be as forthcoming as possible given the
uncertainties of repairing the damage and securing the area.
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Copeland said she found it impossible to get reliable
information on when the street and her theater might reopen.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like a police state out there,'' she said. ``I called the
mayor's hot line and all they would tell me was that the theater
was closed. I said, `I know it's closed. I'm the producer.' I've
done a lot of FBI work this week and no one has told me anything.''
</P>
<P>
   It was not clear what, if any, impact the disruption to Times
Square was having on theaters outside the area.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing really discernible,'' said Jed Bernstein,
executive director of the League of American Theater Owners and
Producers. ``Some shows are up, some are down; it's about what you
would expect for a summer week in July.''
</P>
<P>
   And, though traffic has been badly disrupted, the overall impact
of the accident has not been all bad for tourists and theatergoers,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a funny way, the inaccessibility is balanced by the
accessibility,'' he said. ``Times Square is a big pedestrian mall
right now and people seem to be enjoying it in a way they usually
can't.''
</P>
<P>
   Except, of course, for those who had tickets for ``Cabaret.''

`HEDWIG AND THE ANGRY INCH': THE SAME SELF-DISCOVERY 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By PETER MARKS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ On the return trip to a show you've admired, high
hopes are mingled with grave misgivings. You can't help but wonder
if a first impression was off the mark, if a second viewing will
reveal that the shattering speech on the heath was merely an act of
extreme indulgence, or the transporting production number was
actually a rather faithful imitation of something executed years
before in a dinner theater outside Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   More often than not, however, your reaction is one of
self-congratulation; you were, after all, justified in that
satisfying sensation of discovery. On rarer occasions, the ones
that constitute the best of all possible revisits, the sense of
discovery happens all over again.
</P>
<P>
   Such is the case with a second helping of ``Hedwig and the Angry
Inch,'' the sensational pop-rock musical that is evolving, as
seemed likely when it opened at the Jane Street Theater on
Valentine's Day, into a downtown phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
   As written and performed by the amazing John Cameron Mitchell,
``Hedwig,'' a satirical portrait of a transsexual would-be rock
diva from formerly communist East Berlin, consists of a series of
autobiographical rock numbers built on a foundation of surprises.
Those surprises include the melodic range and power of Stephen
Trask's score, a kind of homage to 40 years of rock history, and
the depth of a story that takes Hedwig on a journey from
self-parody to self-realization.
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell is taking a breather from the show this month, which
provides an opportunity to find out how heavily the success of
``Hedwig'' depends on the actor's star turn. Well, Mitchell can
rest easy (or not, if he's the insecure sort) because his four-week
replacement, Michael Cerveris, is a captivating Exhibit A in the
case for this 95-minute musical, superbly directed by Peter Askin,
as a potential franchise operation.
</P>
<P>
   Cerveris, who recently completed a long run as the ship designer
Thomas Andrews in the Broadway musical ``Titanic,'' embodies the
shape and spirit of Hedwig Schmidt as convincingly as the role's
originator. The danger here always was that in his laughable Farrah
Fawcett wig and black techno hot pants, Hedwig would mutate into
another campy drag act.
</P>
<P>
   Cerveris, who plays Hedwig through next weekend, never allows
this. Reveling in Hedwig's snide self-deprecation, the actor _ who
received a Tony nomination for his performance in the title role in
``The Who's Tommy'' _ delivers the kind of multilayered
interpretation that lets an audience in on the elaborate joke
without turning the character into one.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Cerveris' comfort level is such that on a recent
evening, when a section of the stage lighting broke away and missed
striking members of the onstage band, Cheater, by inches, the actor
seamlessly turned what could have been a disastrous moment to
Hedwig's advantage. The mishap occurred just after Hedwig explained
that the Hotel Riverview, home to the Jane Street Theater, was
actually used in 1912 to shelter survivors of the Titanic. ``We
could be sinking,'' Cerveris remarked in an ad-lib as apropos of
Hedwig's predicament as it was of the Titanic connection in his own
resume.
</P>
<P>
   The musical is set on the opening night of Hedwig's open-ended
New York run in the third-rate dive where he has washed up.
Mitchell's tabloid-trashy, pun-filled script is a spoof on
tear-stained backstage biographical movies like ``The Rose.'' (The
``Angry Inch'' here refers to the name of Hedwig's backup band and
to the appendage with which Hedwig was left after a botched
sex-change operation.)
</P>
<P>
   The twist is that it is through his grotesque stage persona _ he
really is one lousy drag queen _ that Hedwig finds himself after a
lifelong search for what he believes is his other half, a quest
established in a terrific ballad, ``The Origin of Love.'' As Hedwig
explains, he has known only rejection by the men in his life, first
by an absent father, then by a halfhearted husband and finally by a
boy who under Hedwig's tutelage becomes the teen-age rock phenom
Tommy Gnosis.
</P>
<P>
   In revenge, he makes a kind of onstage slave of another drag
performer of indeterminate gender, played as a sneering second
banana by the terrific Miriam Shor.
</P>
<P>
   Trask's music and lyrics integrate the evening's theme of an
identity in crisis; influenced by everything from the Beatles to
punk to Gordon Lightfoot, the score is a true rock pastiche. Hedwig
tries on various rock personae _ the acknowledgments range from
Mick Jagger to Courtney Love _ but floundering impersonations are
all they are. His own identity _ is he the real Tommy Gnosis? _
emerges only when he discovers that there is value in the sound of
his own voice.
</P>
<P>
   At the instant of enlightenment, Cerveris is spectral and
enthralling. Shed of Hedwig's hair and clothes and bathed in a
smoky spotlight, he looks eerily like one of the aliens who greets
Richard Dreyfuss in ``Close Encounters of the Third Kind.'' It's a
mesmerizing metamorphosis, beautiful and spooky.
</P>
<P>
   There has been one change for the worse in the production,
however: a raised decibel level. The opening number, ``Tear Me
Down,'' is so loud that Trask's unerringly smart lyrics are
completely swallowed. Perhaps the thought was that the show
required some revving up. That is not the case. The jolts all exist
in the performances. ``Hedwig'' and Hedwig demand a full hearing.

U.S. HOPES TO RETAIN LACROSSE WORLD CHAMPIONSHIP TITLE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Md., N.J., N.Y.)  (js) 
 By TIMOTHY W. SMITH    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE _ Passion for lacrosse runs deep through Rex Lyons, a
member of the Onondaga tribe in upstate New York and an attackman
for the Iroquois National team in the lacrosse world championship.
</P>
<P>
   Long before Columbus set foot in America, Lyons' American Indian
ancestors invented the game. Lyons' father, Oren Lyons, played
lacrosse at Syracuse University with Jim Brown and Roy Simmons Jr.,
and is in the sport's hall of fame.
</P>
<P>
   But all of Lyons' skill and heritage were no match for the U.S.
squad, which scored 12 goals in the first period and went on to
beat the Iroquois, 24-4, in a semifinal game Wednesday at Homewood
Field on the campus of Johns Hopkins University.
</P>
<P>
   None of the 10 other teams in this tournament can match the
proficiency of the United States, which has dominated the sport of
field lacrosse over the last 20 years. The United States will play
Canada, a 15-11 winner over Australia in the other semifinal, for
the championship here on Friday night. It will be the fourth time
that the United States and Canada have met in the final of the
world championship, which is held every four years.
</P>
<P>
   Canada is the only team other than the United States to win the
title, beating the Americans in the 1978 final, the only game the
United States has lost in world championship play.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. dominance over the last 20 years arises from the fact that
most of its players play field lacrosse from an early age and
advance through collegiate or club-level play.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got a stick when I was 10 or 11,'' said Jesse Hubbard, a
U.S. attackman who played on three straight NCAA national
championship teams at Princeton. ``I played in rec leagues, played
in college and I play on a club team. Most of the guys who play in
college came along the same way. That has given us a lot of
depth.''
</P>
<P>
   This year, the United States has one of its strongest teams
ever. Coached by Bill Tierney, who has led Princeton to five
National Collegiate Athletic Association titles, the U.S. squad is
loaded with players like Hubbard and Casey Powell, the national
collegiate player of the year for the last two years and the
leading career goal scorer at Syracuse University.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``In a tournament like this, the hardest thing for me is telling
three guys they have to sit out a game,'' Tierney said. Tournament
rules allow 23 of the 26 players on each team to dress for each
game.
</P>
<P>
   Equally difficult is fielding a worthy opponent for the
Americans. That is a sore point for the other teams in the
tournament. The U.S. squad was culled from the best 120 players in
the country, and all of them are in their prime. By contrast,
Scotland's goalkeeper, John Marr, is 49, and his team did not get
much of a chance to prepare for the world tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't have a full squad of players until we got here for
the tournament,'' Marr said. ``The only experience we had playing
together was two tournaments in England and a scrimmage.''
</P>
<P>
   In order to make the world championship more competitive, the
International Lacrosse Federation, which governs the sport, has
allowed U.S. players with ancestral roots in other countries to
compete for those countries. The other teams in this year's
championship are from the Czech Republic, England, Germany, Japan,
Sweden and Wales.
</P>
<P>
   The Canadian and the Iroquois teams, the other North American
teams in the world championship, are experienced lacrosse teams,
but they primarily play box lacrosse, an indoor version of the game
played on a smaller scale in hockey rinks with shorter sticks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're still learning the game of field lacrosse,'' said Frank
Nielsen, the Canadian coach. ``Over all, we're better stick
handlers than the Americans, but they're better finishers. They
bury their chances better than we do. After 20 years of playing
mainly box lacrosse, we're adapting. I think we're getting better.
It's a different game.''
</P>
<P>
   The Iroquois Nation was a force in the game during the early
part of the 20th century, but was banned from international
competition in 1932 because its players' participation in various
box lacrosse games was deemed to be on a professional level. After
the ban, the Iroquois teams began primarily playing the box version
of the game, although sometimes they played it outside on dusty
fields enclosed by planks and plywood.
</P>
<P>
   It was not until 1990, when the Iroquois team played in the
world championships in Australia, that American Indians returned to
international competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is their version of the game,'' Lyons said, referring to
field lacrosse. ``The size of the sticks, the rules, the size of
the goal. We don't have any grudges against them because of what
happened with the ban several years ago. We're back in
international competition, and I think we have a bright future.''
</P>
<P>
   The Iroquois once used the game for spiritual purposes and to
settle conflicts and train young warriors. Lyons said there is
still a spiritual quality to the way that American Indians play the
game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whenever we go out and play we feel like our ancestors are on
the field with us,'' Lyons said. ``That's why we play fair and play
our hardest.'' &QL;

BONDS MADE AT THIS SUMMER CAMP LAST FOR GENERATIONS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., Pa.)  (js) 
 By JANE GROSS    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   EQUINUNK, Pa. _ It is shortly before 10 o'clock on visiting day
at Camp Blue Ridge, a 75-year-old sleepaway camp in the Poconos,
and parents are straining at the ropes that separate them from
their children for just a few minutes longer.
</P>
<P>
   The cabins are so spiffy that quarters would bounce on the
tightly made beds. The campers are spruced up for the occasion, the
little ones in crisp hair ribbons and the big ones with legs shaved
smooth as silk. Girls from 6 to 16 hang from the porch railings,
searching the distant parking area for a beloved face.
</P>
<P>
   When the rope is removed, the adults and children surge together
in an exuberant tangle. Eight-year-old Lindsay Breslauer gulps back
tears as she looks for her family. Jackie Brook, an old hand at 13,
is more philosophical about her parents' tardiness. She tries to
comfort Lindsay, a first-year camper.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mother has to be fashionably late wherever she goes, even
her own wedding,'' the teen-ager says, giving Lindsay a warm
squeeze. ``But if she's not here in 10 minutes, I'm getting
adopted.''
</P>
<P>
   Visiting day at any summer camp is a ritual dance _ part love,
part conflict, part ``What did you bring me?'' But at Blue Ridge,
where many of the 240 girls are third-generation campers, there is
more going on than parents and children hugging, bickering and
exchanging gifts after weeks apart.
</P>
<P>
   First at the rope were a set of grandparents who met here as
children and look forward to annual reunions with their own cabin
mates as well as their offspring. And inside each cabin there's a
mother remembering which cot she slept in and where on the wall she
had written her name.
</P>
<P>
   Camps like this, dating back to the 1920s, have become something
of a rarity, driven out of business by those with shorter seasons,
specialized programs or country-club amenities. But here, young and
old alike embrace a place where time seems to stop from the
beginning of July to the end of August.
</P>
<P>
   Like generations before them, the visiting parents and
grandparents, most from Long Island, arrived laden with goodies:
bagels and forgotten stuffed animals, new clothes and five-pound
sacks of cherries, enough candy to create a sugar high that will
last for weeks to come.
</P>
<P>
   The children, too, followed traditional scripts. Anxious and
excited, they were noisier than usual at breakfast. They scowled
when mom said, ``Your bangs are too long,'' cringed when dad
started shooting baskets and beamed when grandma liked the bowl
made in arts and crafts.
</P>
<P>
   Sheila Manchel, the camp owner, considers visiting day one of
the most stressful of the summer, and by 2 p.m. she was checking
her watch. Before day's end, a couple of parents will have
complained about perceived slights against their children. A couple
more will have signed up younger siblings for next summer. One or
two children will be inconsolable when their parents leave at 4
o'clock. The rest will send mom and dad off with a cursory wave and
a mumbled ``luv ya.''
</P>
<P>
   Allie and Charlie Stein were among those glad to greet their
parents and just as glad to say goodbye. ``You can see your parents
whenever,'' said Allie, 11. ``Camp is to get away.'' Her
15-year-old brother, Charlie, who attends Camp Equinunk for boys
across the lake, nodded in agreement.
</P>
<P>
   No hurt feelings, said Ellen and Glenn Stein, their parents, who
made the annual pilgrimage from Great Neck. ``Either we raised two
very independent children or they can't wait to get away from us,''
said Stein, a school psychologist.
</P>
<P>
   Parting was not so easy for little Lindsay, her sister, mother
and aunt. The visitors ignored instructions to leave at 4 and
followed the child as she lined up for afternoon swimming. Mrs.
Manchel's reaction was swift. ``Go fast! This is not good for
her!'' she ordered, peeling the family apart.
</P>
<P>
   Lindsay's face crumpled. But Mrs. Manchel promised the child
that her group leader would jump in the lake fully clothed,
inducement enough to dry the child's tears and get her down to the
shore. ``I make it up as I go along,'' Mrs. Manchel said of her
improvisation.
</P>
<P>
   Camps that last only a week or two are all the rage these days,
preferred by many working couples who don't see enough of their
children during the school year. Niche camps are also popular,
specializing in, say, gymnastics or dance. Then there are
enrichment activities that will stand out on a youngster's college
application, like studying Russian or backpacking in Alaska.
</P>
<P>
   Many old-fashioned camps like this one have folded, unable to
persuade parents that eight weeks of campfires, canoeing and Color
War are worth nearly $6,000. But those that remain tap a vein of
nostalgia. The girls here sing the same songs their grandparents
sang and study their faces on sepia-and-white photographs, dating
back to the 1920s, that hang in HQ, or headquarters, the camp's
main office.

</P>
<P>
   Garbage pails, in age-old Blue Ridge slang, are called ``hungry
barrels.'' The youngest campers play on the ``vomit wheel,''
spinning in nauseating circles. Counselors are allowed to smoke
only at a spot called ``trill,'' for the trillium flower, at the
edge of the lake. Traditions of all sorts matter. Visitors are
always greeted with a chorus of ``a hearty welcome to you.''
Lifelong friends march to the mess hall six abreast with arms slung
over one another's shoulders. The first cabin to gather at morning
and evening lineup gets to raise or lower the flag to a scratchy
record playing reveille or ``Taps.'' The oldest campers, called
PC's (or ``privileged characters'') refuse to have their cabin
painted because it is a shrine to the past, covered with names in
shoe polish that go back generations. ``Where else can you go in
the world where after 30 years it's still the same?'' said Mrs.
Manchel, 60, who began as a camper 48 years ago, met her husband
here, worked for years as the head counselor and finally bought the
camp. ``They call home and say, `I'm on White Mountain' '' _ one of
four competing tribal teams _ ``and their mothers start singing the
song.''
</P>
<P>
   Nothing so marks Blue Ridge as its music, zesty marches and
soulful alma maters written each year and added to the huge canon
of songs that are sung three times a day in the mess hall. To be
truly accepted here is to be picked to stand on a chair and lead a
song. First-year campers stare longingly at the older girls and
mimic their arm movements. Parents say it takes weeks after camp
before the children stop singing and waving their arms.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they come home, all I see for a month is them leading,''
said Bob Fasbender, a New York City television producer with two
daughters here.
</P>
<P>
   Rick Herschcopf, father of 10-year-old Sara, said his wife, Toby
Finkelson, showed him how she used to lead songs when they were
dating, which he found a bit odd, even cultish. Ms. Finkelson died
three years ago. Now her daughter is carrying on that family
tradition and Herschcopf has become a believer.
</P>
<P>
   An informal survey of parents on visiting day suggests that the
spirit here, most evident in the singing, is what persuaded them
that this was the right camp for them. ``When we went into the
dining hall and heard them, we got goose bumps,'' said Randi
Mondshine. ``My daughter looked at me and said, `This is it.'''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Manchel has struck a careful balance between upgrading the
camp and retaining its lost-in-time quality. She has added an
in-line skating course and a rock-climbing wall. The hotel where
parents once stayed for long stretches of the summer, when visiting
was allowed at any time, is now a state-of-the-art gymnasium and
97-seat theater, replacing Sunday night movies on the social hall
floor with a pillow and blanket.
</P>
<P>
   ``My back hurts just thinking about it,'' said Mrs. Manchel, who
dashes around the campus like a woman half her age, teasing and
hugging children along the way.
</P>
<P>
   Some changes are out of the owner's control. Children visit the
infirmary not just for Caladryl lotion and salt-water gargles, but
also for Ritalin and Prozac. On visiting day, they ask their
parents to bring bottles of Poland Spring water instead of kosher
salami and rye. And the midsummer reunion spills from Saturday to
Sunday to accommodate divorced fathers unwilling to visit the same
day as their ex-wives.
</P>
<P>
   Among the visiting former campers was one who had brought her
fiance so Mrs. Manchel could pass judgment. ``I know her longer
than you do,'' the owner told him, sounding like a surrogate
mother-in-law. Another, now a reporter, wrote this article. Others,
working in New York City, begged Mrs. Manchel to let them return as
judges for the four-day competition of Color War at summer's end.
</P>
<P>
   Joanna Carver, a counselor in her 12th Blue Ridge summer, had
her regrets before it was too late. Joanna, a college senior, was
supposed to work at a magazine this summer, but then June rolled
around and she couldn't stay away. ``This is my last summer,'' she
said. ``It is. I swear. Then I have to get a life.'' &QL;

STATE LEGISLATORS BASK IN A GOLDEN GLOW 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Del., Nev., Ohio, Ore.)  (js) 
 By B. DRUMMOND AYRES JR.   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ The 1,200 state legislators who gathered in this
desert gambling mecca this week for the annual meeting of the
National Conference of State Legislatures had the look of winners.
</P>
<P>
   They were flush with money, their state treasuries overflowing
with record tax receipts generated by the booming national economy.
</P>
<P>
   They were happily exploring 1,001 ways to spend that money,
either for new programs or, even better from a political
standpoint, for tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   And they were basking in the results of a new survey that
indicated the U.S. public regards states as more able to govern
than Washington is, a reversal in opinion from 25 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been a legislator for 26 years and we've never had it so
good, or had such great respect, or so many exciting challenges,''
said this year's conference president, state Sen. Richard Finan of
Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   Finan, a Republican who is president of the Ohio Senate, added:
</P>
<P>
   ``A whole lot of the credit has to go to the economy. It's
providing us with the climate and the resources to do things we
previously couldn't do. But there's a lot more to do, too. Congress
is steadily handing us more responsibility, especially where it
hasn't been able to get the job done itself, or, worse, won't do
the job. Also, the courts have come around to our position that a
lot of these tasks have always been our job anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   The workshop agenda this week indicated the breadth of concerns
before state legislatures on the eve of the 21st century _ and the
aggressive willingness of the legislatures, given the buoyant
economy, to grapple with those concerns rather than surrender and
cry out for federal help, as they have in tougher times.
</P>
<P>
   There were the usual issues, like taxes, schools, roads and
crime. But there were dozens of other issues that were previously
mostly handled (or sometimes not handled or mishandled) by
Congress: genetic testing, alternative medicine, fighting cancer
and obesity, international trade and banking, archeological laws,
transportation of hazardous materials, copyright law, disaster
insurance, telecommunications law and, most recently and most
prominently, health insurance, welfare reform, Internet law and
tobacco regulation.
</P>
<P>
   At one workshop that explored the changing relationship between
Washington and the states, state Rep. Lynn Lundquist, the speaker
of the Oregon House, said the new aggressiveness in state
legislatures was long overdue. For too long, he said, the federal
government had played the role of ``Mom and Dad'' and treated the
states like children.
</P>
<P>
   ``There comes a time,'' Lundquist, a Republican, said, ``when
the children have to have a say over their lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, there was no escaping that much of the state
aggressiveness, if not most of it, was attributable not so much to
a profound philosophical shift as to simple economics.
</P>
<P>
   According to a survey released here by conference officials, the
states are in their best financial shape in almost two decades and
will end 1998 with a combined budget surplus of almost 10 percent,
or about $40 billion. The last time the surplus percentage was that
big was in 1980.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Most fiscal experts recommend that states end their budget years
with a 5 percent money surplus.
</P>
<P>
   The conference survey found that over the past legislative year,
because of the extra treasury revenue generated by the booming
national economy, 19 states cut taxes, 23 had made deposits in
their rainy-day reserve funds, 16 selected areas like schools and
prisons for extra financing and 16 financed new projects, like
roads and parks.
</P>
<P>
   The past year was the fourth consecutive year in which a number
of states cut taxes. In each of those years, the cut has amounted
to about 1 percent of the previous year's tax take.
</P>
<P>
   How much longer the states can maintain big budget surpluses and
continue to cut taxes is obviously a guess. But there were plenty
of warnings here that the good times might slow down or even end
fairly soon and that legislative prudence should be exercised.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you enact persistent tax cuts in this economic atmosphere,
you'd best make sure they're sustainable,'' state Rep. Richard
Davis, a Delaware Republican, cautioned at one revenue workshop.
``You certainly don't want to have to turn around and do a tax
increase.''
</P>
<P>
   There were also warnings that state legislators would be wise to
keep a wary eye on possible negative effects of term limits and
ballot initiatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's an overkill danger here,'' Finan said. ``Term limits
are bad if all they do is just chase some people over to the other
legislative house or run off the most experienced hands and leave
lobbyists and bureaucrats to fill the vacuum. Likewise, initiatives
are good for keeping you on your toes, but not if it's so easy to
get on the ballot that the whole legislative process is held
captive. That's no way to govern and keep public trust.''
</P>
<P>
   According to a recent survey by the Pew Center for the People
and the Press, 81 percent of the respondents said they trusted
states either a ``great deal'' or a ``fair amount'' to take care of
important governmental problems. The federal government got only a
60 percent rating on the same question.
</P>
<P>
   A quarter of a century earlier, in a similar survey, the federal
government came out on top with a 70 percent rating. The states got
only a 63 percent rating.
</P>
<P>
   William Pound, the executive director of the conference,
credited part of the public's current good regard for state
government to much-improved performance by state legislators in
recent years.
</P>
<P>
   ``As the country has grown and government everywhere has grown
to keep up, state legislatures have become more professional than
they ever were, especially their staffs,'' Pound said. ``There's
more competition between parties than almost ever before. That's
healthy. And with Congress and the courts handing more
responsibility to the states, the states have had no choice but to
become better and more aggressive.'' &QL;

SETTLEMENT TALKS BEGIN IN NEW YORK CHILD WELFARE LAWSUIT 
</HEADLINE>
  (cb) 
 By RACHEL L. SWARNS    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Child welfare officials and advocates for foster children
announced Thursday that they had begun talks to resolve a
class-action lawsuit that seeks to replace the leadership of New
York City's troubled child welfare agency with a court-appointed
receiver.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement came just two days before the scheduled trial
date, and both sides agreed to delay the start of the trial by one
week. The trial is now scheduled to start on Aug. 3.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit, which was filed by a child advocacy group in
December 1995, said that the child welfare system is so ridden with
illegal practices, chronic mismanagement and indifference to
children that it cannot be fixed internally. Lawyers for children
say little has changed at the child welfare agency over the past
two-and-a-half years.
</P>
<P>
   Child welfare officials have countered that the system has
dramatically improved since the creation of the Administration for
Children's Services in 1996. City officials have often expressed
hope that the lawsuit could be resolved so they could focus more
resources on improving the agency and less on preparing for
litigation.
</P>
<P>
   Leonora Wiener, a spokeswoman for the Administration for
Children's Services, described the talks as ``productive
discussions that may lead to the settlement of this action against
the city.''
</P>
<P>
   Marcia Robinson Lowry, the executive director of Children's
Rights, the group that filed the lawsuit, said the trial will
proceed if settlement talks fail. But Lowry, who has filed several
lawsuits against other troubled child welfare agencies around the
country, said most cases have been resolved before trial.
</P>
<P>
   Lowry declined to describe what a settlement might cover in this
case, but she said they usually ``consist of a court order
specifying what the defendant is obligated to do and a process for
monitoring and court enforcement.'' &QL;

KILLER OF TWO WOMEN SENTENCED TO LIFE, NOT EXECUTION 
</HEADLINE>
  (cb) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   POUGHKEEPSIE, N.Y. _ In the second death-penalty trial in New
York since the punishment was reinstated in 1995, the jury
sentenced a convicted murderer Thursday to life in prison without
the possibility of parole instead of death by lethal injection.
</P>
<P>
   The convicted murderer, Dalkeith McIntosh, was sentenced in a
courtroom crowded with prosecutors and others who had argued that
death was the fitting punishment for a man found guilty of slaying
two women in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   An all-white jury of eight men and four women deliberated for a
relatively quick seven hours over two days before handing down a
unanimous vote for life in prison for McIntosh, who is black.
Formal sentencing by Judge George D. Marlow, of Dutchess County
Court, is scheduled for Sept. 15.
</P>
<P>
   McIntosh, 38, a Jamaican immigrant, stared hard at the jurors as
they entered the courtroom with their eyes downcast. But he
displayed no emotion as the foreman read the verdict. Afterward,
his lawyer said, he was fighting to hold back tears.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyer, William M. Tendy, whose face seemed to grow more
ashen and drawn with each passing day, made no effort to hide his
relief. ``I feel like a very, very large weight's been lifted off
of all our shoulders,'' he said after court adjourned.
</P>
<P>
   Tendy said that the unusually graphic and tearful testimony from
McIntosh's brothers and a sister, who begged jurors to take their
brother's horrific childhood into account, may have saved his life.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's appreciative of what we've done _ he expressed that to
us,'' said Tendy, referring to his team, which had to negotiate
with the United States Embassy to bring McIntosh's siblings here.
``He's less frightened now than I think I've ever seen him.''
</P>
<P>
   On July 8, the same jury convicted McIntosh of fatally shooting
his estranged wife, Francine Williams, a 47-year-old correction
officer, in the head after a quarrel. The jurors also found him
guilty of murdering Williams' daughter, Eunice Williams, 23,
because she had witnessed the first shooting, and of attempting to
murder Anthony Williams, 6, whom he shot in the face. The boy, whom
McIntosh had raised as a son, testified against him in court and
was crucial to the prosecution's case.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, a jury in Brooklyn sentenced Darrel K. Harris to
death by lethal injection for fatally shooting three people in a
robbery at an illegal social club. Legal experts have expressed
surprise that New York City jurors chose the death penalty while
the jurors in Dutchess County, which is largely conservative and
Republican, chose life in prison.
</P>
<P>
   But on the jury's final verdict sheet, it was clear that on two
counts related to McIntosh's motivation for the shootings, at least
one juror had favored a death sentence. But on the other two
counts, the jury was unanimous, and those votes _ for life _
carried the day.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been very hard,'' said a juror, Raphael Gonzalez, as he
was leaving the courthouse. ``Very, very hard.'' The other jurors
declined to comment, but as they ate brown-bag lunches together
after the verdict, they shouted and laughed in the jury room.
</P>
<P>
   District Attorney William V. Grady of Dutchess County, now the
first prosecutor in New York State to seek the death penalty and
not get it under the current law, said he respected the jury's
decision, but insisted that he had been right to press for capital
punishment for McIntosh.
</P>
<P>
   ``Upon reflection, I still feel in light of the heinous nature
of these crimes _ which in essence were execution-style killings _
and the shooting of a young boy in the face, that the death penalty
was the appropriate sentence,'' he said. ``And, in essence, what
the jury has sentenced the defendant to do is to die in prison.''
</P>
<P>
   The lead prosecutor, Edward F. Whitesell, later recited a litany
of brutal crimes, in addition to a documented history of domestic
violence, that McIntosh had been accused of. That criminal record
was barred as evidence in the trial. Both prosecutors criticized
the state capital punishment statute for prohibiting victims and
their families from making statements in favor of a death sentence
to a jury.
</P>
<P>
   Grady said the provision was ``a serious injustice'' because
such victim impact statements, as they are known, are permitted
before sentencing in noncapital murder trials. ``Our most serious
statute is missing a key and essential part,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Tendy said he was troubled by other parts of the law, but
tempered those remarks. ``This is not the time to criticize the
system that just saved my client's life,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   No one from McIntosh's family, most of whom live in Jamaica, was
present for the jury's decision. But Tendy was trying to reach them
by phone this afternoon. Last week, McIntosh's siblings described
sadistic beatings that they said he received from their mother,
Mavis Green, almost from the day he was born. Sobbing as he
recounted some of the most savage abuse, one brother, Glennard
(Harold) McIntosh, 34, said, ``I remember my brothers and sisters
crying out to her, `No! No! You're going to kill him!' ''
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors, arguing that such beatings never took place,
subpoenaed Green to testify in favor of a death sentence for her
son. But they dismissed her without explanation before she took the
stand.
</P>
<P>
   Tendy said he spoke to her after the verdict. ``She's extremely
relieved,'' he said. ``She's relieved that he's not getting killed.
She was worried.''
</P>
<P>
   After two years of preparing for the McIntosh trial and many
more years of appeals now guaranteed, the lead lawyers on both
sides seemed to have little taste for trying a death penalty case
again.
</P>
<P>
   ``There comes a point in time,'' Whitesell said, ``when you
realize it's not just another murder case. You realize that you
have to stand up and make an argument for taking a man's life.
That's not easy.''
</P>
<P>
   The responsibility for saving that life seemed to have left
Tendy utterly drained. ``It's very emotional and it's very
frightening,'' he said. ``You don't eat. You can't sleep. And I
can't at this point imagine me doing this again. It's just too
hard.'' &QL;

EDITORIAL: PROTECTING DIGITAL COPYRIGHTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Friday, July 24:
</P>
<P>
   Traditional copyright concepts that have served this nation well
for centuries should guide the debate on copyright in the digital
universe. As Congress fashions ways to protect commercial interests
in the digital realm, it must be careful also to protect the larger
public interest in broad access to information.
</P>
<P>
   Digital copyright legislation, required to institute two
international treaties that would protect movies, music and other
intellectual property from piracy, passed the Senate and the House
Judiciary Committee this spring.
</P>
<P>
   But controversy continues to swirl around a provision in the
legislation that would make it a crime to circumvent encryption
used to control access to digital material or to manufacture or
sell devices that could be used to circumvent protection measures.
</P>
<P>
   Movie and music producers argue that making circumvention
illegal is the only way to prevent consumer theft of online movies,
recordings and other products. But libraries and schools believe
that the prohibition is so broad that it could greatly limit access
to electronic information that copyright law would otherwise allow.
</P>
<P>
   Existing law assures producers the right to profit from their
creative works. But the law does not allow a creator to control who
looks at the material or prevent the material from being circulated
or lent to others. It specifically allows the ``fair use'' of
copyrighted materials for commentary, criticism, teaching, news
reporting, scholarship and research under certain circumstances
without permission from the copyright owner.
</P>
<P>
   Thus a library can purchase a book, allow hundreds of patrons to
borrow it and let teachers make copies of material in it for
classroom use, all without infringing the copyright. Preserving
these user rights is important in the digital world where copyright
owners, with the right technology, could limit or prevent access to
information.
</P>
<P>
   The content producers dismiss fears that the Internet could
become a strictly pay-for-use world as unrealistic, but neither
they nor Congress can predict how the Internet will develop. That
is why legislation needs to be flexible enough to deal with rapid
evolution in technology and electronic commerce.
</P>
<P>
   A prudent compromise approved by the House Commerce Committee
last week would delay the anti-circumvention rule for two years
while the Commerce Department and the federal patent and copyright
offices study the effect of the prohibition on users.
</P>
<P>
   The commerce secretary could waive the rule for any class of
works where technological shields were impeding the lawful use of
copyrighted matter. The situation would be reviewed every two
years.
</P>
<P>
   Both the content producers and the libraries and schools are
willing to accept this more fluid approach. Congress should adopt
this plan in the final version of the digital copyright
legislation.

NICKLAUS IN PAIN, SHOOTS 74
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Jack Nicklaus appeared anything but hip Thursday,
at times struggling to simply complete his golf swing.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to an arthritic left hip that seems to be worsening, the
Golden Bear had a few of his more awkward moments during the first
round of the U.S. Senior Open at Riviera Country Club.
</P>
<P>
   At the 12th hole, Nicklaus fell out of his swing when his hip
gave out. The problem repeated itself at the 16th hole.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was in some discomfort,'' Nicklaus said. ``I had discomfort
all day. Today, I had a little problem with it. Usually, it doesn't
get into my golf swing, but today it did. It doesn't allow it to
happen past the ball. I can't get out of my own way.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it is a testament to the 58-year-old's resiliency that,
bad hip included, he still shot a respectable 74 that placed him
just four strokes off the lead. Imagine what a healthy Nicklaus
would have shot.
</P>
<P>
   ``It comes and goes a little bit. Today the problem (with the
hip) started around (the eighth or ninth hole),'' Nicklaus said.
``My hardest part was just playing golf. I didn't drive the ball
well. My iron game wasn't particularly good. I putted poorly and I
didn't chip very well. Other than that, I made one really nice
bunker shot and that was it.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though Nicklaus played a courageous round, his hip problem
has become a consuming issue this week. Perhaps far-too consuming
for him. Before the tournament, Nicklaus admitted that he was
already ``sick'' of discussing it.
</P>
<P>
   But anyone who was close to Nicklaus during Thursday's round
could not ignore the injury.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was bothering him,'' said his caddie, Scott Lubin, who
tried to downplay the subject. ``It's there. I ask him and he says
it's OK. He was steady. He'll be back tomorrow and make about eight
birdies.''
</P>
<P>
   Nicklaus' playing partner, Jay Sigel, was just a shot off the
lead with a 71, but even he couldn't ignore the effects the faulty
hip took on golf's best-known player.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jack really feels, looks uncomfortable even walking, and it is
painful to watch him. It is a shame,'' Sigel said. ``He played
very, very well. I think ... in many cases he hit the ball better
than I did. He putted very well.''
</P>
<P>
   It might seem strange that the injury, which has become so
pervasive this week, originally occurred in 1963.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem with the hip happened about 35 years ago in San
Francisco. I hit an eight-iron to the green. By the time I got to
the green, I couldn't walk,'' Nicklaus said. ``They diagnosed it as
bursitis. I had 25 injections in 10 weeks in the hip area. That's
what they used to do, use cortisone. I think they destroyed part of
the area.''
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, Nicklaus skipped last week's British Open precisely
so he could avoid any health problems during the Senior Open.
Nicklaus has won two Senior Open titles in only eight tries,
although he has not won any tournament since 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Beside trying to regain his winning form, Nicklaus is pondering
hip-replacement surgery, which might be the only remedy to his
chronic problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never know from day-to-day what's going to happen,''
Nicklaus said. ``I don't have any (other) tournaments scheduled
right now. That doesn't mean I won't. I won't play until I can do
what I need to do. When I get home, I will spend a week and figure
out what I need to do.''

HERMANN PREY IS DEAD AT 69; BARITONE IN OPERA AND LIEDER 
</HEADLINE>
  (cb) 
 By ANTHONY TOMMASINI   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hermann Prey, the German lyric baritone who was in the 46th year
of an international career as an acclaimed singer of lieder and
opera, died on Wednesday night in Munich, Germany. He had recently
turned 69.
</P>
<P>
   The cause of death was a heart attack, according to Sissy
Strauss, an artistic liaison at the Metropolitan Opera and a
longtime friend, who spoke by phone with Prey's wife of 44 years,
known as Barbel.
</P>
<P>
   Since his New York recital debut in 1956, Prey performed
frequently in New York and attracted a loyal following. Just last
spring, with the conductor James Levine at the piano, Prey gave a
recital of late Schubert lieder, including the composer's last song
cycle, ``Schwanengesang'' (Swan Song) at the 92d Street Y.
</P>
<P>
   This concert concluded the Y's Schubertiade, a 10-year
examination of Schubert's works, which was Prey's idea and for
which he had served as musical director. An illness earlier in the
year had forced him to postpone the recital. When he did perform,
though his voice had frayed, the musicianship, intelligence, and
unmannered expressivity that were hallmarks of his work were
undiminished.
</P>
<P>
   Recalling that recital, Trudy Miller, who was the program
director of the Schubertiade, said yesterday: ``It was clear to all
of us there that Hermann Prey was leaving a blueprint of his
artistry.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Prey's voice was a mellow, light baritone, he sang with
such focused sound and robust projection, that he enjoyed an active
career in opera. He avoided the heavier Verdi roles, but excelled
at Mozart, Gluck, Rossini, and lighter Strauss and Wagner roles.
One of his great achievements was Beckmesser in Wagner's
``Meistersinger,'' which he sang at the Met in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   To his characterization of this town clerk in medieval
Nuremberg, typically portrayed as a scheming buffoon, Prey brought
an emotional complexity and light-on-the-feet comic grace, which
made Beckmesser endearing.
</P>
<P>
   Prey's voice was ideally suited to lieder, and he left a large
and important discography, including songs by Schubert, Schumann,
Strauss, Mahler, and Carl Loewe, a neglected 19th-century composer
whom Prey championed.
</P>
<P>
   Commenting on Prey's 1985 recording of Schubert's
``Winterreise'' with the pianist Philippe Bianconi, The New York
Times critic Bernard Holland wrote: ``This is Schubert singing that
does not twist sound for pictorial or dramatic effect but instead
creates, with unusual musical clarity and purity of tone, a
narrative voice which, though concerned and moved, tells the story
first and lives it only indirectly.''
</P>
<P>
   Prey was born on July 11, 1929, in Berlin, the son of a
merchant. His mother encouraged her son's love of music. At 15, he
passed the physical examination for the German army. But when his
draft notice arrived during the last siege of Berlin in 1945, his
father burned it.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of it in an interview with The Times in 1970, Prey
said: ``For three weeks we had been living in the basement of my
grandfather's house, eating canned foods. We would listen in terror
to the screeching of the bombs, the explosions day and night, the
gunfire. . . I know that the fear I learned then is at the root of
the icy emotions I project whenever I sing Schubert's `Die
Winterreise.' ''
</P>
<P>
   After the war, Prey led a school band in concerts for English
and American troops. To earn money, he sang and played piano and
accordion. In 1948, he enrolled in the Hochschule fur Musik in
Berlin to study with Gunter Baum.
</P>
<P>
   In 1952, he won the third annual Meistersinger contest,
sponsored by the United States Armed Forces assistance program for
German youth activities. Some 2,800 singers between the ages of 18
and 25 entered, and Prey took first place, winning a stipend of
$190 and a two-week concert tour of the United States. His American
debut came in November of that year as a guest of the Philadelphia
Orchestra, conducted by Eugene Ormandy.
</P>
<P>
   Returning to Germany, Prey joined the Hamburg Staatsoper,
singing a wide range of repertory, including a number of
contemporary operas by Rolf Liebermann, Gottfried von Einem, Luigi
Dallapiccola, and Hans Werner Henze. Though he was not notably
involved with new music in later years, he became a highly praised
interpreter of the title role in Berg's ``Wozzeck.''
</P>
<P>
   Prey's 1960 Met debut, as Wolfram in Wagner's ``Tannhauser''
received mixed notices. But he triumphed in his subsequent Met
roles, including the Count in ``Le Nozze di Figaro,'' Figaro in
``Il Barbiere di Siviglia,'' and Eisenstein in ``Die Fledermaus.''
One of his favorites was Papageno in ``Die Zauberflote,'' which he
first sang at the Met in 1967. ``Papageno is misinterpreted by many
singers today,'' Prey said in the 1970 Times interview. ``He is
actually `ein Wesen,' a creature of God in nature, a living thing
between animal and human, a folk philosopher, a kind of Peter Pan
who flies, a wise member of Snow White's dwarfs.''
</P>
<P>
   At 6 feet, with a perpetually unkempt shock of curly blond
(later silver-gray) hair, Prey was a compelling figure on stage. He
was also easygoing, articulate and telegenic: for some years he
served as host of a television program in Munich, performing songs,
discussing music and interviewing guests, which earned him a
reputation as Europe's Leonard Bernstein.
</P>
<P>
   He and his wife lived outside of Munich and had a summer home on
a remote North Sea island. Besides his wife, he is survived by
three children, Annette, Florian and Franziska, and several
grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   Prey's longevity as a singer was due, in part, to solid
technique and a willingness to turn down roles too heavy for his
voice. ``I become so sad when I see my colleagues whose voices have
gone while they are still young,'' he was quoted as saying in
``Musical America'' in 1970, adding, ``I want people to say, when I
am 65 or 70, `Oh look, here comes old Prey to do the `Winterreise.'
Let's go hear him.' '' &QL;

MURRAY PATRICK, 83, HOCKEY STAR AND SCION 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Conn., N.Y., Canada)   (bl)  
 By JOSEPH DURSO   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Murray (Muzz) Patrick, who was raised in a legendary family of
professional hockey players and builders in the middle decades of
the century and became a player, coach and general manager of the
New York Rangers, died July 23 at his home in Riverside, Conn. He
was 83.
</P>
<P>
   His son, Dick, said that Patrick suffered a heart attack.
</P>
<P>
   Murray Patrick was born in Victoria, British Columbia, and was
clearly bred for a life in the major leagues of ice hockey.
</P>
<P>
   His grandfather, Joseph Patrick, had helped build the first
artificial ice rinks in Canada, at Vancouver and Victoria. His
father, Lester Patrick, became a Hall of Fame star in the National
Hockey League and later the coach of the Rangers. His uncle, Frank
Patrick, joined Lester as one of hockey's great builders and
innovators. And Murray's brother, Lynn Patrick, played and coached
in the National Hockey League, as did his nephews, Craig and Glenn.
</P>
<P>
   He was nicknamed Muzz by a boyhood friend because he had a full
head of curly black hair that somehow translated into Fuzzy Muzzy,
and the name stuck. But he grew into a hulking defenseman, 6 feet 2
inches tall and weighing 205 pounds, with a rough-and-tumble nature
to go with all the tradition that made the Patricks pillars of
Madison Square Garden.
</P>
<P>
   The tradition reached a milestone in 1940 when the Rangers won
the Stanley Cup, a moment in history that had to last 54 years
until they won another in 1994. A hard skater and pile-driving
defenseman, Patrick scored only five goals during his four seasons
and only two goals during the championship season. Yet, in the
playoffs, he scored three times, including one key goal in overtime
in Game 5 at Toronto. And in the best traditions of the family, the
championship team was coached by his father.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers received shares of $1,009 each for winning. But
Murray Patrick remembered: ``That was a lot of money in those days.
It was the first time the players' shares went above $1,000.''
</P>
<P>
   He once described life in professional hockey through the
violent contrasts between the Rangers and the Garden's other team,
the Americans, in these words:
</P>
<P>
   ``When we played each other, it was like the Civil War. The
landlords against the tenants. The aristocrats against the people's
choice. The Yankees against the Dodgers. There was electricity in
the place.''
</P>
<P>
   Patrick left many more memories of his combative attitude, which
he displayed most notably one night in 1939 when he enlivened the
Garden with a one-punch knockout over Eddie Shore, the star
defenseman for Boston. The fight started after Shore, in Patrick's
words, was ``massaging Phil Watson's neck with his stick and I had
to help.''
</P>
<P>
   Patrick's hockey career was interrupted in midstream in 1941
when he joined the U.S. Army. He served as an officer in North
Africa, in the battle for Anzio in Italy and during the invasion of
southern France.
</P>
<P>
   After the war, he returned to the Rangers for one more season
before retiring as a player after the 1945-46 season. But his
career was committed to hockey, and he pursued it as a coach and
manager in Seattle and Victoria before returning to Madison Square
Garden on Jan. 6, 1954, as coach of the Rangers, a job that both
his father and brother had filled.
</P>
<P>
   He replaced Frank Boucher, a onetime Hall of Fame hockey player,
for the rest of the season, then yielded the position to Phil
Watson and moved into the Rangers' front office as general manager.
He remained general manager for 10 years before undertaking a
variety of other executive jobs at the Garden.
</P>
<P>
   As general manager, he negotiated several memorable trades. In
1961, he acquired Doug Harvey from Montreal to become a
player-coach for New York. And later he traded Gump Worsley to
Montreal for Jacques Plante in an exchange of All-Star goaltenders.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick returned as coach of the team at the start of the 1962
season, until he hired Red Sullivan to take over. Then he went back
to the front office until his retirement in 1973.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick is survived by his wife of 54 years, Jessie; 2
daughters, Lynda Vargas and Lori Koleszac; 2 sons, Dick and Paul,
12 grandchildren and 2 great-grandchildren.

DON DUNPHY, 90, DISTINCTIVE BOXING BROADCASTER 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By GERALD ESKENAZI   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Don Dunphy, the nasal-voiced announcer who brought the Friday
night fights into America's living rooms in the era when voices had
faces, died July 22 at St. Francis Hospital in Roslyn, N.Y. He was
90.
</P>
<P>
   In a career marked by his election to 10 halls of fame, Dunphy,
with his staccato style, called the blow by blow for more than
2,000 fights, 200 of them for titles, 50 for the heavyweight
championship.
</P>
<P>
   His clear voice cut across the crowd noise, but Dunphy never
allowed himself to become the focus. He was an objective observer
of a most subjective sport, and his style was good enough for him
to announce championship fights 40 years apart from 1941 to 1981.
</P>
<P>
   But on the night he once described as ``the greatest event in
sports history'' _ Muhammad Ali's first fight against Joe Frazier
in New York's Madison Square Garden in 1971 _ Dunphy refused to
share the microphone. The event was too important, he believed, to
become a mere show-business spectacle.
</P>
<P>
   That night, when Frank Sinatra was shooting pictures at ringside
for Life magazine, and Col. Harland Sanders of Kentucky Fried
Chicken was in celebrity row in his white suit, the theatrical
promoters had the movie star Burt Lancaster beside Dunphy. The idea
was for Lancaster, a friend of one of the promoters, to handle the
color commentary. But the mild-mannered Dunphy said: ``I'm working
these rounds solo. Burt Lancaster can talk between rounds.''
</P>
<P>
   At his home in Manhasset, N.Y., Dunphy kept a tape of one of his
famous broadcasts, Joe Louis' 1941 heavyweight fight against Billy
Conn _ his first broadcast of a title fight. Although that was his
first year of broadcasting the fights for Gillette, he had already
crafted his signature no-nonsense delivery, pungent phrasing and
just the right ring of drama.
</P>
<P>
   In the 12th round, Dunphy announced above the roar of the crowd,
``Louis is staggered by a left hook!'' And then, ``The champion is
hurt!'' Louis held on to win, however.
</P>
<P>
   Dunphy, who was born in New York City on July 5, 1908, went to
Manhattan College, where he ran on the mile relay team. (``I never
fought,'' he said. ``I was too good a runner.'') He began a radio
career on local stations broadcasting football and minor league
baseball. He was also the host of a boxing talk show. His first
blow-by-blow broadcasts came in 1939, but he leaped to fame in 1941
when Gillette began its Friday night fight tradition.
</P>
<P>
   Dunphy liked to tell people that he got the job through an
audition competing with other announcers, each of whom worked a few
rounds of the Gus Lesnevich-Anton Christoforidis fight at the
Garden.
</P>
<P>
   ``The other guys tripped on the second names,'' Dunphy would
explain. ``But I just called them Gus and Anton.''
</P>
<P>
   He called fights on radio for Gillette for 19 years
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes I would hear criticism that I was faking it on the
broadcasts,'' he recalled in 1984. ``But I never did. Not all the
fights are epics; in fact, most are not. But if punches weren't
being thrown, I'd describe the body movements, the footwork, and
that seemed to create excitement for the listeners.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1960, he deftly moved to television to call fights on ABC.
Although by the 1970s he had retired from network television, he
was still in demand for such major closed-circuit bouts as the
Ali-Frazier battle and Ali's epic confrontation with George Foreman
in Zaire in 1974.
</P>
<P>
   Dunphy's expertise was not limited to boxing. He also handled
Yankee baseball games, the Cotton Bowl in college football, track
and field events, bowling, basketball and horse racing. But boxing
was his signature sport: he appeared in six movies, all as a boxing
announcer, and when his autobiography was published in 1988, it was
entitled ``Don Dunphy at Ringside.''
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife of 56 years, Muriel; two sons, Don
Jr. of Westbury, N.Y., and Robert of Ridgefield, Conn., and five
grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   For many years, Dunphy was paired with the sports columnist Bill
Corum on radio. On television and in closed-circuit events, he
shared a ringside broadcasting seat not only with Ali and
Lancaster, but also with such entertainers as Pearl Bailey, Flip
Wilson and Ryan O'Neal.
</P>
<P>
   He was not a fan of modern television's insistence on multiple
announcers at ringside. ``When two or three people do blow by
blow,'' he said in a 1996 interview, ``they overtalk and emphasize
too much.'' &QL;

U.S. SUPREME COURT TO CONSIDER NYC SEX-SHOP LAW 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Giving a glimmer of hope to New York City's sex
shops, U.S. Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens chose Thursday
to refer to the entire court a request by the shop owners to delay
enforcement of a law that bans sex-oriented businesses in most
neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   Stevens' action came a day after Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg
rejected a last-minute request for a stay. Ginsburg was the first
to consider the application because she handles cases from this
region, but federal law allowed the sex-shop owners to appeal to
one other justice before giving up. Their lawyers have said they
chose Stevens because they felt he would be most sympathetic to
their cause.
</P>
<P>
   As the request for a stay was circulated to members of the court
Thursday, city officials said they were already sending out
inspectors to determine which sex shops and strip clubs were not in
compliance with the new zoning law. Nevertheless, lawyers for the
shops described Stevens' action as a victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``This gives us a great deal of encouragement,'' said Herald
Price Fahringer, a lawyer representing 107 adult-entertainment
businesses. ``My hope is that the Supreme Court will hold up
enforcement as the responsible thing to do.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he hoped the Supreme Court would decide whether to grant
a stay by Friday. Court spokesman Ed Turner said the justices would
probably decide the matter quickly because applications for stays
are ``handled on a fast track.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Commenting on Friday's decision and on the application before
the court, Colleen Roche, a spokeswoman for Mayor Rudolph Giuliani,
said: ``There is nothing to react to. In the interim, we will
proceed with the inspections and enforcement.''
</P>
<P>
   The law, which was passed in 1995 and has been the subject of
court battles ever since, prohibits sexually oriented businesses
from operating within 500 feet of residential areas, schools, day
care centers, houses of worship or one another.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the sex shops, who had become increasingly
pessimistic in recent months as various courts ruled against them,
sounded almost giddy Thursday. They said they would ask the Supreme
Court to take on the full case this fall, adding that they thought
Stevens' decision to share the request for a stay with the entire
court could be a sign that he thinks the full case has merits.
</P>
<P>
   But people familiar with the court said it was not unusual for a
justice to refer an application for a stay to the entire court.
</P>
<P>
   The new law would affect 146 of the city's 164
adult-entertainment businesses. City officials have said they hope
rigorous enforcement will persuade most owners of sex shops to go
out of business, and in fact in recent days some shops in Times
Square have begun removing sex videos from their shelves or
requiring nude dancers to wear bathing suits.
</P>
<P>
   In his application to the Supreme Court on behalf of the sex
shops, Fahringer suggested that many of the shops would close
immediately if a stay was not granted. ``Once the zoning resolution
is enforced, the petitioners will either have to close their
theaters and bookstores or face criminal prosecution,'' he wrote.

BY APPEALING TO REBELS, U.N. CHIEF MAKES PEACE WITH MEXICO 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JULIA PRESTON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan has
delicately defused a diplomatic crisis with the Mexican government
during a visit here by calling on the Zapatista rebels to return to
the negotiating table to resolve the smoldering conflict in the
state of Chiapas.
</P>
<P>
   Annan repeatedly praised President Ernesto Zedillo's strategy in
the four-year-old face-off between the government and a ragtag
guerrilla army with a broad base of support in Indian villages.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can see that he is personally committed to finding a
solution,'' Annan said of Zedillo. ``The government is looking for
a political solution and does not seek a military confrontation. I
think this is the right approach.''
</P>
<P>
   While Annan's emphasis served to smooth ruffled feathers in the
government, it seemed sure to disappoint human rights and
pro-Zapatista groups, which have been agitating for the United
Nations to criticize the government and take a role in mediating
the dispute.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, the Zapatistas published a long communique in which
they accused the government of lying about its intentions to seek
peace and of conducting a ``war of extermination'' against them. In
recent months government troops have launched attacks to dismantle
four town governments set up by the Zapatistas and to arrest their
leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Annan walked into a minefield around the issue of Chiapas on his
two-day visit to Mexico. Offhand comments he made this month,
suggesting that the United Nations might be interested in a role in
Chiapas, provoked an irate response from the government, which said
it had no intention of seeking international mediation.
</P>
<P>
   United Nations officials were apparently taken aback by the
ferocity of Mexico's response. They said the United Nations could
only begin to consider intervening in an internal conflict when
formally invited by the local government and even then complex
approvals from the Security Council or the General Assembly were
required.
</P>
<P>
   United Nations leaders had not even been considering such a
possibility, one official said.
</P>
<P>
   But the dispute pointed up how sensitive the Mexican government
is about any hint of an international role in Chiapas. Earlier this
year, government officials hounded a Catholic bishop, Samuel Ruiz
Garcia, out of his role as a mediator in peace talks, which stalled
late in 1996, in part because he was openly seeking to involve
foreign groups in Chiapas.
</P>
<P>
   In their communique, the rebels of the Zapatista National
Liberation Army said the government had ``destroyed the only bridge
for the dialogue'' by forcing out Ruiz.
</P>
<P>
   Chiapas completely dominated the press coverage and public
debate about Annan's visit. As a result, Chiapas also forced its
way into the discussions between the secretary general and Zedillo,
even though it was not on the formal agenda.
</P>
<P>
   At a 90-minute meeting between the two leaders on Wednesday,
U.N. officials said, Zedillo gave a half-hour exposition of his
views on the conflict.
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes two to tango,'' Annan said at a news conference on
Wednesday. ``I would urge the other parties to work in a sustained
and persistent manner with the government to seek a peaceful and
political solution.''

 &HT;    Millwood steadies, wins 3-2
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ The rest of the Braves rotation has maintained
all summer what makes Atlanta's starting pitching so extraordinary
is not up front but at the far end. Thursday night, Kevin Millwood
explained what that meant.
</P>
<P>
   After allowing Philadelphia an early run, Atlanta's fifth
starter allowed the Phillies just one more while the Braves
recovered for a 3-2 victory, Javy Lopez and Curtis Pride providing
the fireworks with back-to-back homers in the sixth inning.
</P>
<P>
   The decision left Millwood at 11-5 _ two runs allowed on eight
hits with six strikeouts _ after he had lost three of his last four
starts. The Braves swept a two-game set from the Phillies to open
their road trip, which continues tonight with a weekend series in
Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   Lopez gave the Braves their first lead of the night with two
outs in the sixth. Phillies starter Tyler Green started him with a
change-up away, and when he came back with a high fastball Lopez
crushed it over the wall in center for his 21st homer of the season
and a 2-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
   But the Braves weren't done. Curtis Pride, an added starter when
Michael Tucker was scratched late, watched one ball and then
homered to the left-center gap three pitches later for a 3-1 lead.
The homer was his third, but his second in 12 at-bats, making it
the 10th time thus season Atlanta has hit back-to-back home runs.
</P>
<P>
   Andruw Jones, trying to work out of Bobby Cox's doghouse, had
already thrown out a man at the plate when he came up in the fifth
and waved at another Green curveball for his second strikeout. But
the ball bounced away from catcher Mike Lieberthal and Jones made
first with some heads-up running on the wild pitch. Ozzie Guillen
then lofted a soft single into right which Jones correctly read and
took third base.
</P>
<P>
   When Keith Lockhart then sent a liner into shallow center, Jones
again read the play, waited to tag up as Kevin Sefcik made a
running catch and then scored to tie it 1-1 when Sefcik could not
make a strong throw to the plate.
</P>
<P>
   Millwood labored early, allowing four hits while throwing 41
pitches just to get through the second inning. Atlanta trailed 1-0
after two and it could have been worse. The Phillies loaded the
bases twice in the second but managed just one run, that coming off
a Tyler Green sacrifice fly on a 1-2 pitch. Millwood then walked
Sefcik to load them again but induced a first-pitch pop-out from
Desi Relaford to end the inning.
</P>
<P>
   Chipper Jones' hitting streak is now 12 games.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Democratic governor of Puerto Rico, pushing for
a chance for his island to vote for statehood, has come up with a
tempting sales pitch for the Republican-controlled Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine a place, Gov. Pedro Rossello and his lobbyists say, that
opposes abortion, hands out vouchers so children can attend
parochial schools, has sliced capital-gains taxes, allows school
pupils five minutes for prayer, and is busy privatizing many of its
major industries. The place, they add, hoping to clinch the deal,
is Puerto Rico.
</P>
<P>
   ``Puerto Rico passed the `Contract With America,''' said an
important backer in Congress, Sen. Larry Craig, R-Idaho, and it is
a point that the Idaho Republican never fails to make to
incredulous colleagues as he pushes his legislation for a
congressionally sanctioned referendum on Puerto Rico's status.
</P>
<P>
   It is an uphill battle to persuade his fellow Republican
senators, especially the majority leader, Sen. Trent, R-Miss., to
take the chance that Puerto Rico will not, as a state, send two
Democratic senators and six Democratic representatives to
Washington. That fear, along with the fact that Puerto Rico is
Spanish-speaking, has kept the Republican-controlled Congress from
acting quickly in accordance with the party's 1996 platform plank
that ``we support the right of the U.S. citizens of Puerto Rico to
be admitted to the Union as a fully sovereign state after they
freely so determine.''
</P>
<P>
   To get the party to live up to that pledge, Rossello is trying
to convince Republicans that the island will make a stellar 51st
state and that Puerto Ricans will not necessarily vote for
Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   It is a message that other statehood supporters are sending,
too. Just last month, Jack Marquez, a Puerto Rican who was
decorated for his service in the Vietnam War, established the
Puerto Rican American Foundation here. The lobbying group, modeled
on the influential Cuban American National Foundation and working
independently of the Puerto Rican government, seeks to spread the
gospel about Puerto Rico's conservative conversion.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very conservative society,'' Marquez said. ``Not a
`West Side Story,' welfare-cheating society as it is portrayed in
some circles.''
</P>
<P>
   His group recently ran an advertisement on conservative talk
shows supporting a Republican bill for education tax credits,
saying, ``If school choice can work in Puerto Rico, it will work
for America.''
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of statehood counter that the Republican image is not
as pure as Rossello and his supporters have presented it. Puerto
Rico also has strict gun control laws and a universal health care
system. ``And we still have the view that the government is the
most important player guaranteeing social justice for the people,''
said Anibal Acevedo Vila, president of the Popular Democratic
Party, which supports keeping a variation of the island's current
commonwealth status. In other words, despite the governor's recent
efforts, many Puerto Ricans love big government, Avevedo Vila said.
</P>
<P>
   In March, the U.S. House of Representatives voted 209-208 to set
Puerto Rico self-determination in motion. The 10-year process would
begin with a referendum allowing Puerto Ricans to choose among
three options: independence, statehood or commonwealth status.
</P>
<P>
   The bill was supported by proponents of statehood, including
Rossello and both houses of the Puerto Rican Legislature, as well
as the relatively small faction supporting independence. It was
vigorously opposed by commonwealth backers, who said the bill, in
putting forward a narrow definition of commonwealth for the
referendum, was unfairly slanted toward statehood.
</P>
<P>
   Now the onus is on the U.S. Senate. Lott has said there is
simply not enough time this year to grapple with an issue as
contentious as Puerto Rico's self-determination. But Sen. Frank
Murkowski, R-Alaska, who heads the Committee on Energy and Natural
Resources and vividly remembers Alaska's own struggle for
statehood, is forging ahead with a streamlined bill that at the
least would allow for a referendum and a set of approved
definitions.
</P>
<P>
   Republican pollsters and consultants have advised party members
to seize on the issue of Puerto Rican self-determination, saying it
is a natural for Hispanic voters and one that tracks with the
party's support of statehood.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hispanics in this country hold many of the same virtues and
values as Republicans, but they continue to feel alienated by what
they characterize as the close-mindedness on the part of
Republicans in their approach to governing,'' two Republican
pollsters, Ed Goeas and William Stewart, wrote in a report on a
national study of Hispanic attitudes.
</P>
<P>
   The issue is complicated, especially in an election year,
confronting as it does questions of language and cultural identity.
Although Puerto Rico is predominantly Spanish-speaking, English is
routinely spoken in government and business, and it has a distinct
culture.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one should assume that the road to a status change will be
short or smooth,'' Murkowski warned at a recent hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Spain ceded Puerto Rico to the United States in 1898 after the
Spanish-American War. Congress granted U.S. citizenship to Puerto
Ricans in 1917 and made the island a commonwealth in 1952. Puerto
Rico has its own laws, taxes and government. Puerto Ricans who live
on the island are subject to U.S. military service, but do not pay
federal taxes, cannot vote for presidential or congressional
candidates, and are not entitled to most federal benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Puerto Ricans are almost equally split between statehood and
commonwealth status. Relatively few favor independence.
</P>
<P>
   ``At least 75 percent of Puerto Rican voters align themselves
with status options rather than candidates, programs or solutions
to pressing problems,'' Murkowski said. ``This orientation distorts
governance.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   One important battle over the referendum bill centers on how to
define ``commonwealth.'' Commonwealth supporters pushed for a broad
definition that would guarantee American citizenship, among other
things. The House rejected that definition, and now commonwealth
backers say they will boycott the referendum, if it comes to pass.
Statehood supporters say a definition guaranteeing citizenship is
unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   Without a guarantee of U.S. citizenship, most Puerto Ricans,
even those who see economic advantages in commonwealth status, are
likely to vote for statehood.
</P>
<P>
   In pressing their case for a referendum, which they believe will
lead to statehood and greater economic prosperity on the island,
Rossello and his chief lobbyist, Xavier Romeu, have painstakingly
listed the governor's chief accomplishments since 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Rossello has privatized the government-owned shipping industry,
the hotel industry and, most recently, the telephone industry. He
has cut the capital gains tax to 7 percent from 20 percent. He has
slashed welfare spending by 20 percent and made both English and
Spanish official languages. And Puerto Rico has seen a 19 percent
reduction in the personal income tax.
</P>
<P>
   The pitch does not thrill Democrats of Puerto Rican descent.
Rep. Jose Serrano, a New York liberal who supports the referendum,
practically grimaces at the thought of Puerto Rico as a
conservative bastion, describing it as pandering.
</P>
<P>
   ``You do so much to please the master,'' said Serrano, who calls
Puerto Rico the last U.S. colony. ``People are desperate to make
their point. It's like we can make you guys wish you had another 50
states just like us.''

JURORS DELIBERATING FATE OF FORMER AIR FORCE CADET 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Eds.: No verdict as of 9:30 p.m., CDT) 
 
By JOHN W. GONZALEZ 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW BRAUNFELS, Texas _ In passionate closing arguments Thursday,
prosecutors portrayed capital murder defendant David Graham as an
arrogant executioner who played God to fulfill his domineering
girlfriend's demands to kill a romantic rival.
</P>
<P>
   But Graham's defenders, conceding that the former U.S. Air Force
Academy cadet covered up the 1995 slaying of 16-year-old Adrianne
Jones near Fort Worth, pleaded for a not-guilty verdict from the
five-woman, seven-man jury. Attorney Dan Cogdell said the state
coerced Graham's false confession and relied on flimsy
circumstantial evidence obtained by a ``confederacy of dunces''
known as the Grand Prairie Police Department.
</P>
<P>
   The harshly conflicting arguments, following five days of
testimony, apparently caused jurors to proceed slowly with their
deliberations, which began about 4:30 p.m, CDT.
</P>
<P>
   There was no verdict by 9:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors opted not to seek the death penalty at the behest of
the victim's family. If convicted of capital murder, Graham, 20,
would automatically be sentenced to life in prison with no parole
for at least 40 years.
</P>
<P>
   Because of extensive publicity in North Texas, the trial was
moved here from Tarrant County, where the murder occurred Dec. 4,
1995, and where co-defendant and former U.S. Naval Academy
midshipman Diane Zamora, Graham's ex-fiancee, was convicted of the
same crime and given a life sentence earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout this trial, questions were raised about how blame
should be shared by the former sweethearts. Prosecutor Mike Parrish
said that in his own words, Graham described how he and Zamora
planned to kill Jones to satisfy Zamora's ``womanly vengeance''
related to Zamora's unfounded suspicion that Graham had been
unfaithful to Zamora with Jones.
</P>
<P>
   ``She told him to do it, and he did,'' Parrish said.
</P>
<P>
   Fellow prosecutor Michelle Hartmann described Jones as the
unsuspecting victim in a trap set by Graham and Zamora.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was the sacrifice on the altar of David Graham's ego, his
cowardice, his utter lack of humanity,'' Hartmann said.
</P>
<P>
   Parrish told jurors that it remains unclear why Graham chose
Jones to falsely portray as a previous love interest, sending
Zamora into a rage. Regardless, the prosecutors said, his
confession proved his guilt because it included details about the
murder that he could have known only if he were present.
</P>
<P>
   With Jones' family watching from the packed courtroom's front
row, Parrish described what he called the most likely scenario for
Jones' death. He said the tragedy began with a phone conversation
in which Graham lied to Jones, his teammate on the Mansfield High
School cross-country track team, to lure her out of her house late
one Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   With Graham driving and Zamora hidden in the trunk, Jones got
into Zamora's car and was driven to near Joe Pool Lake, where
Zamora emerged from hiding and struck Jones on the head with a
heavy object, Parrish said. Jones surprisingly came to and tried to
flee but was pursued by Graham, who struck her in the head with a
potentially fatal second blow and, after she collapsed, shot her
twice in the face from close range, Parrish said.
</P>
<P>
   The crime went unsolved about nine months, until Zamora's
college roommate told naval authorities that Zamora had confessed
to her. Within a few days, in early September 1996, Zamora was sent
home from the Naval Academy in Annapolis, Md., and was arrested in
Texas and Graham was interrogated and arrested at the Air Force
Academy in Colorado Springs, Colo. Before their arrests, Graham and
Zamora met in Colorado and coordinated their stories, prosecutors
said.
</P>
<P>
   Parrish said Graham callously asked authorities to guess what
object was used to strike Jones before she was shot to death and he
asked for a written promise that the death penalty would not be
sought against him. In addition to his formal confession, he also
penned jailhouse letters that confirmed his guilt, Parrish said,
including one that said, ``Whether or not I shot someone is beside
the point.''
</P>
<P>
   Cogdell urged jurors to consider lesser offenses, including
murder and aggravated kidnapping, but he emphasized his contention
that the state failed to prove Graham was at the murder scene.
Instead, the state relied on emotional appeals, Cogdell said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They waved around bloody pictures,'' Cogdell said. ``... It
affected you and you'd be without a heart or without a soul if it
didn't.''
</P>
<P>
   He called the state's presentation ``a Wal-Mart prosecution'' in
which jurors were asked to peruse a series of attractive yet
conflicting scenarios that never mesh.
</P>
<P>
   ``Day by day, witness by witness, the state changed its theory
at least five times,'' Cogdell said to jurors. ``Every day they
wanted you to buy something else.''
</P>
<P>
   Cogdell also assailed Graham's confession, pointing out that its
very first sentence, in which Graham claimed he had a single sexual
encounter with Jones a month before her murder, was proven false by
a prosecution witness. That witness said she took Jones home the
night Graham claimed he had sex with her.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sounds like a Danielle Steele novel,'' the attorney said.
``It's full of prose, it's full of pretty language, it's full of
heart-tugging memories. But what does it say about the crime? Four
sentences ... that proved to be dead wrong.''

FIGHT-GAME FAULTS REACH RACETRACKS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   At Del Mar, the purse is raised from $150,000 to $250,000 for
Saturday's San Diego Handicap, as a racetrack press release phrases
it, ``in anticipation of'' Silver Charm running. At Monmouth Park
in New Jersey, the purse is raised from $250,000 to $500,000 and
the distance is changed from 1 1/16 to 1[ miles for the Aug. 30
Iselin Handicap so that Skip Away will enter.
</P>
<P>
   And in general, horse racing feels more like boxing every day.
</P>
<P>
   As if the two ancient sports didn't have enough problems in
common, including public suspicion of the results and the
widespread perception of inhumanity. Now, more and more, horses'
handlers imitate fight managers by demanding as much money as
possible for races posing as little risk as possible, and tracks
imitate fight promoters by paying. The upshot: The showdowns the
fans want to watch rarely happen.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to blame owners and trainers for cashing in on the
drawing power of their marquee horses, whose careers can end at any
moment.
</P>
<P>
   Less understandable is the thinking of track executives. Raising
a purse to attract Silver Charm, the popular 1997 Kentucky Derby
winner, or Skip Away, the nation's top-ranked thoroughbred,
guarantees a bigger crowd for one day. But it takes money away from
purses for everyday races, cheats history and the public out of the
talked-about matchups upon which the sport was founded, and
encourages horse owners to think future purses are negotiable as
well.
</P>
<P>
   It's worthwhile if a track sweetens the pot to encourage two or
more ``name'' horses to race against each other, as Santa Anita did
in 1995, boosting its Derby from $500,000 to $700,000 on the
condition that the field included four winners of graded stakes at
one mile or longer.
</P>
<P>
   It's shortsighted if a track sweetens the pot so that a single
famous horse will liven up an otherwise drab race, creating a
mismatch.
</P>
<P>
   (And it's worse than that when the famous horse proceeds to lose
the race because he isn't ``cranked up,'' as Silver Charm did in
last month's Stephen Foster Handicap, which Churchill Downs
inflated from $500,000 to $750,000.)
</P>
<P>
   Some have criticized the San Diego Handicap purse increase
because Silver Charm is owned by Bob and Beverly Lewis, and Bob
Lewis is chairman of Thoroughbred Owners of California, which had
to approve the change. Others have pointed out that Silver Charm
probably would have run in the San Diego even without the purse
increase. But Lewis' conflict of interest and the question of
necessity are secondary concerns.
</P>
<P>
   When the fledgling National Thoroughbred Racing Association
becomes a full-fledged governing body, it should exert some
influence over scheduling and purses, encouraging tracks to raise
purses only to increase _ rather than dilute _ competition.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, the NTRA might as well be the WBO.
</P>
<P>
   !arrow! &UR; The weekend: &LR; !off! Silver Charm drew post 6, one from
the outside, and will carry 125 pounds, giving away eight to 15,
for the San Diego on Saturday. He and jockey Gary Stevens figure to
sit off the lead, to be set by Hal's Pal or Mud Route, early in the
11/16-mile race, a prep for the 1\-mile Pacific Classic.
</P>
<P>
   Among the weekend's four stakes at Del Mar, the other big one is
the Bing Crosby Handicap on Sunday. Son of a Pistol, coming off
back-to-back stakes victories, and Gold Land, the '95 Bing Crosby
winner, are among seven likely entrants in one of the top sprints
of the summer.
</P>
<P>
   !arrow! &UR; Claim to fame: &LR; !off! Of the two winners in the divided
Oceanside Stakes on Wednesday, Ladies Din was the more impressive,
but Scooter Brown had the more interesting background.
</P>
<P>
   Scooter Brown, a 3-year-old gelding by Fly Till Dawn, has run
for four trainers already. He was claimed in consecutive maiden
races at Santa Anita, for $50,000 by Bob Baffert from Bob Hess Jr.,
then for $62,500 by John Sadler from Baffert.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was probably 20th on Baffert's depth chart,'' Sadler joked
after the Oceanside, Scooter Brown's fourth win in six starts since
the claim. ``He had so many great 3-year-olds, I think he had to
run one of them for a high (claiming price).''
</P>
<P>
   !arrow! &UR; Comedown: &LR; !off! After the full program on opening day,
fields of seven or fewer horses account for half the races Thursday
and today.
</P>
<P>
   Del Mar racing director Tom Robbins said he thinks the horse
shortage will be temporary, caused by the late arrival of some
barns and by a strong finish at Hollywood Park.

   !arrow! &UR; Notes: &LR; !off! Two memories of Brian Mayberry, who died
Monday at 60: 1.Despite being a third-generation racehorse trainer,
and thus a part of one of the world's more insular subcultures, he
had an active, broad mind. A conversation with Brian invariably
turned to politics or something else outside the track. 2.That
didn't make him any less passionate about racing. I'm thinking
about a horsemen's association meeting, in the stately Santa Anita
turf club a few years ago, where Mayberry rose to speak, went on a
profane, five-minute rant and stormed out, disgusted by the
proceedings. Of course, he might have had one or two.... Defying
our prediction, the Del Mar race timer did not malfunction on
opening day. On the other hand, the fire alarms kept going off
accidentally.... Said Bill Kingston, of the Hollywood Park
promotions department, during an appearance on intertrack TV
Monday: ``Thanks, one and all, to all you racing fans. It's because
of your support that this great racing industry survives.''
Survives? Thank !ital!you!off!, Bill, for that cheery message. &QL;

`SAVING PRIVATE RYAN' A POWERFUL MOVIE OF SOLDIERS IN COMBAT 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By LOUIS B. PARKS 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the American heartland, one farm displays four stars in the
front window. Each star represents a son serving in World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Following D-Day, June 6, 1944, the mother of those sons gets
three devastating telegrams.
</P>
<P>
   Three deaths in one family is enough, the military brass decide.
The fourth son, Pvt. James Ryan, must be pulled out of battle and
sent home.
</P>
<P>
   Pvt. Ryan parachuted behind enemy lines on D-Day. The Army
doesn't know his exact location or even if he is still alive. It
just knows that wherever he is, there will be German soldiers and
desperate fighting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Saving Private Ryan'' is the story of eight U.S. soldiers _
Rangers _ sent to find one soldier and bring him out of danger.
Around this simple story director Steven Spielberg, writer Robert
Rodat and star Tom Hanks have fashioned a magnificent and stunning
picture of soldiers in combat.
</P>
<P>
   To say that ``Saving Private Ryan'' is the best war movie ever
made _ as ``Citizen Soldier'' author Stephen Ambrose has done _
bypasses many great films. But ``Saving Private Ryan'' definitely
ranks among the finest.
</P>
<P>
   It is certainly the most realistic major war movie ever in its
depiction of the horrors, confusion and courage of infantry combat.
The combat scenes, shot with jolting, hand-held cameras from low
angles, give the film an incredible documentary feel that lets us
see through the eyes of a soldier.
</P>
<P>
   As good as that is, however, it would be meaningless by itself.
What elevates ``Saving Private Ryan,'' making it far more than a
well-staged action film, is its ability to convey the simple
humanity of soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   This movie reminds us constantly that under the uniform of a
combat soldier is an ordinary civilian, homesick, scared, tired and
angry. He is not a hard-nosed professional, but a man eager to do
his job as well as he can, get it over with and go back alive to
his real world.
</P>
<P>
   That's why it is Tom Hanks, not some Hollywood action hero, who
plays Capt. John Miller. Hanks' common-man characteristics embody
the concept of the citizen soldiers of World War II _ most of them
never in uniform until after Pearl Harbor _ who fought and won the
war.
</P>
<P>
   We first see Miller aboard a landing craft approaching Omaha
Beach on D-Day. Like others around him, some praying, some vomiting
because of the stormy seas, he is scared of what lies just minutes
ahead.
</P>
<P>
   As the landing craft drops its gate, a slaughter begins. When
the first projectile wangs immediately through the helmet of the
fron4B9, we know this will be no traditional combat film.
</P>
<P>
   For the next half-hour, we are dragged up the beach and into the
slaughter with Miller and his men. Confusion and death reign. Men
are blown in the air and land with limbs missing. They are shot in
the water, and die silently. Their blood pours onto the sand.
</P>
<P>
   Progress is not made through heroism _ though courageous deeds
are everywhere _ but through sheer necessity. To stay on the beach
is to die.
</P>
<P>
   The D-Day assault is one of two major battle scenes that frame
``Saving Private Ryan,'' and both are amazingly realistic. Both,
particularly the first, are free of the sense of careful staging
and poetic violence found in most war movies. Events seem to happen
naturally with no character sure to die because the story line
takes him home next week or sure to live because he's a nice guy.
</P>
<P>
   Between the battles is the search. Miller is sent with seven men
to locate Ryan. As they get farther into hostile country, the men
begin to question what they are doing there. Why are their lives
less important than the life of Private Ryan? Don't they have
mothers too?
</P>
<P>
   ``This Ryan better be worth it'' becomes a familiar refrain.
</P>
<P>
   Miller, too, in his private moments, has doubts about the
mission.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'd better go home and invent the cure for some disease or a
longer-lasting light bulb,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Whether or not the men find Private Ryan alive was surely meant
to be the film's biggest question. That went out the window when
Matt Damon, who was virtually unknown when Spielberg cast him as
Ryan, became a star too big to leave out of posters after the movie
was shot.
</P>
<P>
   But we still must find out what kind of man he is. The squad
certainly does not expect what they find.
</P>
<P>
   Capt. Miller remains a mystery to his troops, believing that
withholding part of himself gives him a strength and aura that he
needs in order to lead. He also wants to keep his home life sacred
and apart from the horrors he sees here, as though somehow by not
speaking about it, he can keep it, and himself, safe and unchanged.
</P>
<P>
   Miller's only confidant is Sgt. Horvath (Tom Sizemore). They
fought in Italy together. Pvt. Reiben (Edward Burns) is the most
outspoken of those opposed to the mission and charismatic enough to
get the other men to listen.
</P>
<P>
   One of the film's many powerful and tense scenes occurs when the
squad takes a German prisoner after a bitter, costly fight. They
have no way to take prisoners on this mission. The ensuing argument
over shooting this enemy, now begging for his life, shocks the
naive Cpl. Uhham (Jeremy Davies) who has never been in combat and
is totally unprepared for what it makes men capable of.
</P>
<P>
   Good moments large and small abound. When the squad links up
with a larger unit with Nazi prisoners, Pvt. Mellish (Adam
Goldberg) holds up his Star of David and shouts ``Jude, Jude''
(Jew, Jew) at them.
</P>
<P>
   Hanks is perfect as Miller, his average-man look and style
molding itself exactly to the idea of the common civilian forced to
do things he would never have believed possible in his former life.
</P>
<P>
   Spielberg, as usual with his serious films, has built an
excellent cast of fine actors and gotten the best from them. Edward
Burns, the writer, director and star of independent films (``The
Brothers McMullen''), was intended as the hot young newcomer. He
holds up well here as a challenge to Hanks' authority.
</P>
<P>
   Sizemore, Damon and the rest of the cast are also all fine, with
Barry Pepper, as a sniper who prays before each kill, especially
memorable.
</P>
<P>
   But Spielberg is the star of this movie, not because he makes us
aware of his presence, but because he makes us forget it by putting
us so completely in the world of combat. The battle scenes in this
movie were amazingly hard to stage and shoot, and they are
unforgettable.
</P>
<P>
   A squad of new World War II movies are in the pipeline,
including the much-anticipated ``The Thin Red Line,'' from the
James Jones novel. They have a high standard to follow in ``Saving
Private Ryan.''
</P>
<P>
   The graphic violence of ``Saving Private Ryan'' is not the
``Gee, that's cool'' beautifully choreographed violence of
Hollywood action films. Men do not get shot and fall neatly dead,
or ask their friends to ``Go get 'em for me, boys.'' They die
bloody and slowly and crying for mother or morphine.
</P>
<P>
   How can this be entertaining? That's the wrong word, but the
movie is riveting and fascinating. I can hardly wait to see it
again and to take my father, a D-Day veteran.
</P>
<P>
   As with ``Schindler's List,'' Spielberg manages to show
something unspeakably horrible, without sentiment and without
flinching, yet makes us feel uplifted by it. The movie portrays
American soldiers as merely human and more to be admired and
appreciated for their humanity.
</P>
<P>
   Spielberg wanted to make a movie that honored men, such as his
father, who fought in the war. And he wanted to make a movie that
made war seem unthinkable. He has managed both magnificently well.
</P>
<P>
   The movie is rated R for intense, prolonged, realistically
graphic sequences of war violence, and for language. &QL;

PROSECUTORS FIGHT SYMINGTON'S REQUEST FOR HONDURAN VACATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PAT FLANNERY  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Despite his conviction on federal fraud charges last summer,
former Gov. Fife Symington wants to spend a weeklong Christmas
vacation with his family in Honduras this year.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors stepped in his way Thursday, filing papers in U.S.
District Court saying the onetime developer and Republican
political leader has no reason to take the trip, particularly in
view of the fact that he owes restitution to victims of his crimes.
</P>
<P>
   ``His desire to take a tropical vacation, even as he fails to
make any restitution payments, is insufficient to merit modifying
the conditions of release pending appeal,'' prosecutors wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors David Schindler and George Cardona also said the
court should not tolerate even a minimal risk that Symington could
flee, nor should his victims face a risk that Symington will
``conceal assets in a foreign country or . . . spend money on
lavish foreign travel rather than make restitution.''
</P>
<P>
   John Dowd, Symington's attorney, bristled at the comments and
accused prosecutors of ``financial bigotry'' by holding the
Symington family's wealth against him.
</P>
<P>
   ``This happens to be a family treat to him (Symington),'' Dowd
said. ``It's not lavish.''
</P>
<P>
   Symington's pretrial services officer, the person appointed by
the court to keep track of Symington's whereabouts, does not oppose
Symington's request.
</P>
<P>
   Symington was convicted in September of defrauding lenders who
extended millions of dollars in loans to his real-estate ventures,
most of which later went belly up. Many loans were not repaid.
</P>
<P>
   He was sentenced in February to 2{ years in prison and five
years' probation, but he remains free pending appeal of his case to
the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals.
</P>
<P>
   Symington's conviction has done little to change his lifestyle.
An heir to an East Coast steel fortune, Symington is often seen in
the chichi eateries of the East Camelback financial corridor, where
he still maintains an office at the Camelback Esplanade.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, since petitioning for personal bankruptcy in 1995,
he has claimed few assets of his own. Most of the family's assets
are in the name of Symington's wife, Ann, a wealthy heiress in her
own right who has financed his multimillion-dollar legal battles
through most of this decade.
</P>
<P>
   Ann Symington also made news late last year by becoming an
investor in Roy's, a trendy upscale chain of restaurants
specializing in Pacific cuisine that opened an outlet in
Scottsdale.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to asking this week for permission to travel to
Honduras, Symington asked the court for permission to travel with
his wife to Hawaii at the end of this month on restaurant-related
business.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors are not opposed to that trip, apparently because it
is business-related.
</P>
<P>
   It is up to Judge Roger Strand of the U.S. District Court to
decide whether to modify Symington's travel restrictions to
accommodate the trips.
</P>
<P>
   Symington made a similar Christmas sojourn to Honduras last year
after his conviction but before his passport was lifted at
sentencing.
</P>
<P>
   Although he is free to move about within Arizona, Symington must
now have the permission of his pretrial services officer to go out
of state and must stay within the continental United States. He
also must stay in contact with his pretrial services officer.
</P>
<P>
   Early this week, Symington asked Strand to modify those terms to
expand that travel. The Honduras trip is scheduled for Dec. 25 to
Jan. 2.
</P>
<P>
   But prosecutors suggested Thursday that the vacation simply
cannot be justified.
</P>
<P>
   ``Defendant is a convicted felon facing a substantial term of
incarceration,'' they wrote. ``In addition, he has been ordered to
pay restitution to the victims of his crimes.''
</P>
<P>
   Precisely how much Symington owes is uncertain. Although Strand
imposed restitution as a condition of Symington's sentence, he left
the amount to be decided by the U.S. Bankruptcy Court, where
Symington is battling a group of pension funds that loaned him $10
million to develop a downtown project a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   That loan was never repaid, despite a court judgment that now is
well over $12 million, with interest.
</P>
<P>
   The pension funds are suing to keep the debt from being
discharged by the Bankruptcy Court. If successful, the pension
funds could attach any assets Symington claims as his own in the
future.
</P>
<P>
   All Symington's other debts were discharged last year.
</P>
<P>
   Dowd said prosecutors' concerns about Symington's restitution
are unfounded because ``there has been no final judgment in
Bankruptcy Court.'' &QL;

GANGSTER PARODY FULL OF TIRED JOKES 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By ANDY SUMMA 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Would Lloyd Bridges want to be remembered this way?
</P>
<P>
   His last major film turned out to be ``Mafia!,'' a degenerate
flop that's meant to send up gangster films _ but instead parodies
the parodies.
</P>
<P>
   The craggy-faced actor of such classics as the 1952 western
``High Noon'' and the pioneering TV series ``Sea Hunt'' is perhaps
best known for his hilariously goofy performances in ``Airplane!''
and ``Airplane II: The Sequel.'' These nonstop laughathons,
dependent on silly puns, crazy puns and groan-inducing puns,
presented Bridges to a whole new audience.
</P>
<P>
   The same audience that laughed at Bridges' wild antics in
``Airplane!'' is the one obviously targeted for ``Mafia!.'' But
they'll yawn through this 1 1/2-hour flatulence joke. Directed by
Jim Abrahams (``Airplane!,'' ``Hot Shots!''), ``Mafia!'' completely
bungles the intended comedic hits.
</P>
<P>
   Gangster movies such as ``GoodFellas,'' ``The Godfather'' and
``The Godfather Part II'' are long overdue for an ``Airplane!''
makeover. These films' deliciously intriguing and openly violent
underworlds are practically tailor-made for parody.
</P>
<P>
   But Abrahams doesn't choose these mafia masterpieces to send up.
Curiously, he chooses the 1995 Martin Scorsese retread, ``Casino,''
as his framework. And instead of poking fun at the hit man or
kingpin personas, Abrahams relies on such howlers as El Nino jokes
and vomit gags. These movies have never been highbrow, but
``Mafia!'' scrapes the bottom of the now-empty barrel for laughs.
</P>
<P>
   The film follows a juvenile Tiny Tim character named Vincenzo
Cortino (Jason Fuchs). After accidentally discovering an
underground drug transit system, Cortino is forced to flee Italy
for America. He sneaks out of trouble by hiding, um, in a mule.
Don't ask. It's not any funnier on screen, either.
</P>
<P>
   Then the little boy misses the boat to New York and has to swim
across the Atlantic to Ellis Island. There, at the immigration
office, Abrahams pans across the immigrants _ stopping long enough
to hear an Indian quip, ``But I had reservations!''
</P>
<P>
   The laughs keep coming as Vincenzo grows up to become the mighty
but accident-prone patriarch of the country's most powerful crime
family. Along the way, we are introduced to his hunchbacked old
mother, two n'er-do-well sons and his opulent empire built on good
old-fashioned ``decapitations and bloody violence.''
</P>
<P>
   Now in his twilight years, and a victim of an attempted
assassination, Cortino must hand over the keys to the kingdom to
one of his sons. One is a passive war hero, Anthony, played by Jay
Mohr; the other is a violent, irrational maniac (a weak nod to Joe
Pesci). Cortino chooses Anthony, and he promptly heads to Las
Vegas. There, he runs a crooked casino, where smart visitors ``mail
us the money to save on air fare.''
</P>
<P>
   Amid dated Democratic party-funding humor, tired slapstick
jamborees and more body excretion jokes, Anthony meets a wild
dancer named Pepper. He falls in love with her, and his
slot-machine empire soon crumbles. Then he finds out she's sleeping
with his maniacal but gifted brother.
</P>
<P>
   The film ends with a grossly underdeveloped ``Godfather'' trap,
complete with explosions and mafia doubletalk. Everybody dies, but
``Mafia!'' mines a golden comic nugget when (hold your breath!):
Barney, the purple dinosaur, gets whacked!
</P>
<P>
   There are a few chuckles _ and one or two truly hilarious sight
gags _ but there's nothing new here. The jokes are the same, but
with different deliveries. It's like watching a rerun.
</P>
<P>
   Bridges' 57-year acting career landed him in 161 performances _
some good (``Hot Shots!''), some bad (``Honey, I Blew Up the
Kid''). But I don't think even Bridges _ wherever in the cosmos he
is now _ would pay to watch ``Mafia!.''
</P>
<P>
   He'd probably just rent ``Airplane!'' again.
</P>
<P>

UTILITY SUBCONTRACTOR ALSO AT FAULT IN HIT-AND-RUN SUIT 
</HEADLINE>
 AWARD-AZR   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By VICTORIA HARKER  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It wasn't only a drunken driver who killed 11-year-old
Christopher ``Kipp'' Turner four years ago, a jury concluded
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   It was also a Southwest Gas Company subcontractor that failed to
provide a safe walkway at a construction site along Frank Lloyd
Wright Boulevard in Scottsdale.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, the Maricopa County Superior Court panel awarded $6
million to Kipp's parents, Ted Turner and Deborah Luck.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel relief as a father, and to be on the other side of the
legal proceedings,'' Turner said afterward.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been four long years,'' he added. ``It's time to live.
It's time to move on.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he continues to have nightmares about the night he
watched in terror as his son died. The two were walking home April
12, 1994, to watch a videotape they had just rented when the boy
was killed by a hit-and-run driver, Edward Palenkas.
</P>
<P>
   That evening, Palenkas and a friend had dinner and cocktails at
Reata Pass Steak House. Palenkas, who was drinking and had earlier
in the day taken prescription drugs, refused offers of a ride home
from the bartender and his friend.
</P>
<P>
   After hitting Kipp, Palenkas never stopped or slowed down,
Turner said. Police later traced the car to Palenkas using
fragments of a broken turn-signal lens.
</P>
<P>
   Palenkas pleaded guilty to manslaughter and leaving the scene of
a fatal accident. He was given five years' probation and ordered to
donate $20,000 to Mothers Against Drunk Driving or similar
organization.
</P>
<P>
   Turner and Luck filed a wrongful-death suit in 1994. Their
attorney, Richard Treon, said the accident never would have
happened if Southwest Gas and its subcontractor, Arizona Pipeline
Company, had made a safe walkway for pedestrians alongside the
road.
</P>
<P>
   Southwest Gas and Arizona Pipeline were found 75 percent
responsible for the death, making them liable for $6 million.
</P>
<P>
   Palenkas, who was not a defendant in the suit, was found 25
percent responsible by the jury. Palenkas and Reata Pass earlier
had settled out of court with Kipp's parents for a reported $1.9
million.
</P>
<P>
   Treon said evidence at trial showed that the utility and the
subcontractor ignored every provision involving safety and
pedestrians required in its city permit for placing pipelines in
the area of Frank Lloyd Wright Boulevard and 100th Street.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead of taking 15 minutes at the end of the day and
cleaning up the work site and making it safe for pedestrians, they
had huge piles of dirt along the roadway, forcing Kipp and Ted to
walk along the street,'' Treon said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They violated a fundamental principal: You don't lead
pedestrians into the path of motor vehicles.''
</P>
<P>
   He and Turner said they want the verdict to send a message to
construction companies to make roadway sites safe for pedestrians.
</P>
<P>
   In a written statement, Southwest Gas said, ``It should be
clarified that Southwest Gas was a defendant in name only in this
case. Arizona Pipeline as a contractor bore full responsibility for
the defense and any adverse judgment in this case.''
</P>
<P>
   Attorney Peter Spaw, who represents Arizona Pipeline, said the
verdict set a disturbing precedent.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my heart, I just don't feel as though that was a right
decision,'' Spaw said. ``. . . I think it sends a wrong message to
drivers who drink and dads who don't watch their kids.''
</P>
<P>
   However, the jury Thursday determined that Ted Turner was not to
be responsible in any way for his son's death.
</P>
<P>
   Kipp was an honors student who was preparing to skip from sixth
grade to eighth.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was an exceptional young man, very tender and very
thoughtful and generous with his time,'' Turner said.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me as a father, what's been difficult is that I had to go
through something like this to find out what kind of a person my
son was.'' &QL;

EDITORIAL: SHELDON SILVER CAVES 
</HEADLINE>
  (cb) 
 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Friday, July 24:
</P>
<P>
   After a do-nothing legislative session that ended last month,
New York State Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver has now called his
house back to Albany to do something foolish. He wants the members
to pass a sham parole bill called ``Jenna's law'' that is being
pushed by the Republican Senate and Gov. George Pataki.
</P>
<P>
   The law, named after a young woman killed in Albany last year,
is being promoted by the Republicans as a way to get tougher on
violent criminals. As it turns out, Jenna's law would not have
protected Jenna Grieshaber from the man accused of her murder. He
would already have served his time in jail. This bill also provides
no help for criminals who are destined to go free eventually, even
after serving 85 percent of their sentences as this bill requires.
If dumped onto the sidewalk with little counseling and education,
which are deemed jailhouse luxuries by the Pataki administration,
these ex-cons are prepared mostly to return to New York's
overcrowded prisons.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Silver has stretched out on the pavement and allowed the
anti-parole forces to stampede over him. The speaker announced this
week that he wants assembly members to return to Albany next
Wednesday evening for a quick fix in time for this fall's
elections. The move is strictly defensive. Democrats in a few
conservative districts of the state have convinced Silver that
their Republican opponents will use Jenna's law as a club in the
fall campaign. The state Republican Party has already sent out more
than 150,000 posters showing Silver lined up alongside nine mug
shots of the state's most notorious convicted criminals.
</P>
<P>
   The attack is demagogic. But Silver's response has been craven.
He has said that caving to the Republicans on this issue would
``take politics out of'' the parole issue. In fact, it puts
politics into the making of public policy in a way that worsens New
York's problem with overcrowded prisons that serve as training
schools for criminals.

EDITORIAL: A FOOD FIGHT WORTH WAGING 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Friday, July 24:
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton has asked Congress to provide $101 million to
bolster government efforts to insure the safety of the nation's
food supply. The funds would be used to deploy more food safety
inspectors and new technology, expand research into the causes of
and solutions to food-related illness, and educate consumers and
retail food outlets on the safest food handling practices.
</P>
<P>
   There is growing public concern about the large number of
food-caused illnesses, including some from unexpected sources like
the salmonella in cereal that sickened 200 people in 11 states last
month. Indeed, Clinton's initiative could well be stronger. But he
is having a hard time getting the Republicans who control the House
and Senate to furnish even the modest sum he has requested.
</P>
<P>
   The House has allocated just $16.8 million for the program, far
short of the amount required to make serious headway against the
hazards associated with bacteria, viruses and parasites in food.
The Senate's original response was even more grudging. The
agriculture spending bill that hit the Senate floor last week set
aside a measly $2.6 million. But it finally dawned on lawmakers
that this could be a tough position to defend to voters. Sen. Tom
Harkin, Democrat of Iowa, then won approval for an amendment to
increase the appropriated amount to $68 million. That is progress,
but well short of what is required. Surely food safety is at least
as important as some of the pork-barrel projects buried in the
transportation bill.
</P>
<P>
   The issue now moves to a House-Senate conference committee. Some
lawmakers have argued that money for new programs is tight this
year, and that some of the Food and Drug Administration's
responsibilities could be delegated to state and local governments.
But health officials estimate that food-borne diseases account for
up to 30 million cases of illnesses and 9,000 deaths a year.
Imported foods, which are only rarely inspected now, increasingly
contribute to the problem. This is hardly a time to be diminishing
the federal government's role. Congress should find the money to
finance the White House food safety initiative, and then promptly
attend to the administration's proposals to strengthen the policing
authority of food agencies.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Remember how smitten you were, how bowled over and
enchanted, by your first foreign film? The experience was in every
sense an eye-opener: the exotic words from the lips of heavy-lidded
actors, the voluptuous camera work, the smoky, seemingly
unrestrained carnality.
</P>
<P>
   Well, sitting through ``Faust, Version 3.0,'' the live,
multimedia piece by the Barcelona theater company La Fura dels
Baus, is the opposite of that. A compression of the epic verse play
that took Goethe a lifetime to compose, ``Faust, Version 3.0'' is a
disenchantment that manages to close the mind in an economical 100
minutes. It's as muddled and gratuitously profane as a particularly
juvenile effort by a group of first-year film students.
</P>
<P>
   The production at the New York State Theater, part of Lincoln
Center Festival '98, will no doubt have its partisans, although the
performance I saw seemed to leave the audience sort of woozy and
baffled. La Fura, a troupe founded in 1979, specializes in visual
spectacle, and if it's music-video style razzmatazz you're after,
you may find what you're looking for here. The company sets off
fireworks with the precision of the Gruccis.
</P>
<P>
   The vast State Theater stage looks as if it had been redecorated
by Mummenschanz going through a heavy-metal phase. Two towering
steel sculptures _ one of whirling cylinders, the other, a giant
fan blowing through billowing tubes _ stand guard at stage right
and left. (At one point in the show, the fan is turned on, a la one
of those curtain songs in old Broadway musicals, apparently to
distract the audience from some onstage personnel shifting.)
Modular screens fold and unfold, actors dangle upside down from
rotating platforms, a video of a raging inferno metamorphoses into
the real thing.
</P>
<P>
   What does any of this have to do with Goethe? Good question. La
Fura seems to be trying to translate the nearly two-century-old
German work into some universal language of the late 1990s, cobbled
together from television and video-game images and computerese. But
all the troupe really accomplishes is transforming a masterpiece
into techno-gibberish. Consider La Fura's own justification, noted
in its press materials:
</P>
<P>
   ``The saturation of information in the computer web, often read
from an optimism which is heir to the optimism of progress, does
not improve, nor transform the human condition, created without
purpose by evolution's laws of chance: tied to the imperious
demands of primary instincts against which the retaining walls of
social rules are erected.''
</P>
<P>
   You want me to run that by you again? It often appears to be the
case in the theater these days that the more a company has to
explain, however ineptly, what it is trying to do, the less
successful it is in actually doing it. (The handout says even those
whirling cylinders and billowing tubes have hidden meaning, as
symbols intended to correspond to themes in the music. Uh huh.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Faust, Version 3.0'' _ the title, of course, is a software
term _ transports the legend of Faust to the World Wide Web. In
this adaptation, performed in Spanish with a mediocre simultaneous
English translation, Faust (Santi Pons) is fed up with the
knowledge he has gained through computers, and with some nifty
horror-movie special effects hangs himself from a sparking
electrical cord.
</P>
<P>
   Talk about your existential crises: After he's dead, Faust meets
Mephistopheles, played with authority by Miquel Gelabert as a kind
of thuggish, supernatural Goodfella, who in their famous pact
whisks Faust away from the world of knowledge with an offer to
expose him to the pleasures of the flesh.
</P>
<P>
   The dialogue is filled with pseudo-intellectual aphorisms (like
``Art is long; your life is short'') that put you in mind of a
half-baked extension-school philosophy course: ``Existence: Good or
Bad?''
</P>
<P>
   And the humor is of the lamest sort; late in the proceedings a
game-show parody, of all tired things, is staged. Yet much of
``Faust, Version 3.0'' is neither computer-driven nor pensive in
that cerebral way we think of as ``European.'' It's just kind of
smutty.
</P>
<P>
   Obscene acts are presented for their shock value. There's a
sense of adolescent rebellion about these moments, as in, ``How
much can we get away with?''
</P>
<P>
   The members of the troupe have been quoted as saying that
``Faust, Version 3.0'' is their first production with a written
text. It shows. As with so much of what is presented in the
contemporary theater, this ``Faust'' is a vanquishing of the script
by the blueprint. ``Razzle-dazzle 'em, and they'll make you a
star,'' goes the line in ``Chicago.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, not always.

EDITORIAL: IRAN'S MISSILE TEST 
</HEADLINE>
  (cb) 
 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Friday, July 24:
</P>
<P>
   Iran's test of a missile that can reach Israel, Saudi Arabia and
Turkey is a disturbing and dangerous development. Testing such an
advanced weapons system, potentially capable of carrying
biological, chemical and nuclear as well as conventional weapons to
targets 800 miles away, heightens anxieties in an already tense
Middle East. It also raises new doubts about whether Iran, despite
the encouraging words of its moderate President, Mohammad Khatami,
is actually turning away from threatening its neighbors and from
developing weapons of mass destruction, two conditions for improved
relations with the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Islamic conservatives strongly opposed to President Khatami's
foreign and domestic policies still wield paramount power in Iran.
That was further demonstrated by the harsh sentence for corruption
and mismanagement imposed Thursday on Tehran's mayor, an important
Khatami ally, and the shutting down of the country's most
influential pro-Khatami newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Washington must now try to divine what the missile test reveals
about the power struggle in Iran and the ability of President
Khatami to produce more moderate foreign policies. The Clinton
administration's efforts to renew a dialogue with Iran should be
pursued, but they must also be realistic.
</P>
<P>
   The administration also needs to initiate wider diplomatic
efforts to curtail outside aid to Iranian missile programs. The
missile tested Wednesday is based on a design imported from North
Korea. But Russia and China have also repeatedly exported sensitive
missile technology to Iran. Washington should demand that Russia
and China tighten their export controls and punish violators. It
should also press North Korea to end rogue missile exports.
</P>
<P>
   The administration ought to devote some attention to reassuring
Israel, which considers Iran its most dangerous enemy and feels
newly vulnerable. Syria already has missiles capable of reaching
Israel; Iraqi Scuds did so during the gulf war, and now Iran may
soon pose a missile threat.
</P>
<P>
   The immediate dangers facing Israel, however, have not
substantially increased, and Israel should not act precipitously.
Iran's new missiles are not yet operational, and Tehran remains at
least five, and probably more, years away from developing nuclear
weapons. That allows some time for arms control and diplomacy.
Israel can also improve its regional security by pursuing efforts
to negotiate peace with the Palestinians. Iran's missile test is a
warning of future danger that should not be ignored.

STUDY SAYS OLD WASTE IS STILL POLLUTING HUDSON 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By ANDREW C. REVKIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ A federal environmental study has found that
``hot spots'' of PCB contamination in the upper Hudson River are
not being buried in protective layers of silt, as some scientists
have contended, but instead are disgorging fresh streams of the
industrial PCB pollutants into the water, where they could
accumulate in fish and pose a cancer threat to people who eat the
fish.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, senior officials with the Environmental Protection
Agency said Thursday that it might be necessary this fall to
conduct accelerated cleanups of some hot spots, possibly including
dredging or covering the zones where the escape of PCBs into the
river is most severe.
</P>
<P>
   The shift to urgent tones and talk of immediate action came as a
sharp contrast to the decadelong analysis the environmental agency
had been conducting to figure out how to handle the PCB
concentration in the river bottom. And it comes at a time when
studies of other pollutants have shown the river to be cleaner than
it has been in decades.
</P>
<P>
   General Electric Co., which operated two factories that legally
released more than 1 million pounds of PCBs into the river before
the government banned such discharges in 1977, has long contended
that the contaminated areas are mainly dormant and that time and
currents will steadily bury them.
</P>
<P>
   But the new study, released at a news conference and public
meeting Thursday in Albany, concluded that most of the 36 patches
of badly contaminated river bottom were being regularly scoured by
currents and that those in one stretch of the river had released
several tons of PCBs into the water over a 10-year period.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that these PCBs are so rapidly re-entering the river
system is startling,'' Jeanne Fox, the regional administrator of
the EPA, said in a printed statement. ``Given what we know about
the health risks of eating contaminated fish, this information is
even more disturbing. We are evaluating the implications and will
decide by the fall what steps should be taken to stem this loss.''
</P>
<P>
   At the news conference, Douglas Tomchuk, the EPA official in
charge of the Hudson River evaluation, said that the actions could
include dredging of the worst spots or capping them with clean sand
_ or still doing nothing.
</P>
<P>
   General Electric scientists criticized the report and the shift
toward possible action. ``This has more to do with politics than
science,'' said Melvin Schweiger, who is managing the company's
cleanup of its old factory sites and its research on the PCBs in
the river.
</P>
<P>
   ``If their theory were correct, we'd see higher PCB levels in
the water and fish, when in fact the levels are significantly
lower,'' he said. (The state's Health Department advises young
women and children to eat no fish from the Hudson.)
</P>
<P>
   The EPA study, which analyzed several hundred cores of mud
pulled from the river bottom over the last 22 years, is one in a
series of recent reports by federal scientists that conflict with
General Electric's generally rosier view of the problem.
</P>
<P>
   A crucial finding, said Dr. Edward Garvey, a consultant who
conducted the study for the EPA, was that highly contaminated spots
in a dammed pool downstream from the factories had leaked about a
third of their contents into the river over a 10-year period, 1984
to 1994.
</P>
<P>
   ``This says that this is a dynamic system,'' Garvey said. ``This
is not a problem you can put on a back burner and say someday we'll
come back and do something about this.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Tomchuk said that a quick decision to do something about the
worst spots was not unlike the decisions made during many federal
Superfund cleanups of toxic waste sites around the country, when
some unexpected threat turned up.
</P>
<P>
   ``As you collect data at a site, you're always looking at it to
see if there's any news here to protect human health or the
environment,'' Tomchuk said. ``If you uncover leaking drums, you
take them away.''
</P>
<P>
   PCBs, or polychlorinated biphenyls, are a family of compounds
once used as insulators in electrical equipment. They were banned
in 1977 amid evidence they cause cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since 200 miles of the Hudson river bottom were deemed a
Superfund toxic site 15 years ago, the federal agency and General
Electric have been locked in a scientific and public relations
battle over the nature of the hazard posed by the silt, and what to
do about it.
</P>
<P>
   When a final decision is rendered, a decision that the EPA
administrator, Carol Browner, has promised by the end of 1999, the
company could have to pay hundreds of millions of dollars to dredge
the bottom, plus additional millions in damages for resources, like
fisheries, that were lost because of contamination.
</P>
<P>
   Communities and politicians along the upper stretches of the
river, from Troy to the old factory sites at Fort Edward and Glens
Falls, have generally sided with General Electric and opposed
dredging of the river, saying they fear the creation of hazardous
waste landfills.
</P>
<P>
   Tomchuk said Thursday that any mud from short-term dredging of
hot spots would go to existing landfills that are designed for
toxic materials.
</P>
<P>
   Private environmental groups and some elected officials whose
districts lie closer to New York City have been pressing the EPA
harder in recent months to speed the cleanup and efforts to make
General Electric pay.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly GE is losing the scientific debate about whether PCBs
are heading down the river,'' said Richard Brodsky, chairman of the
New York state Assembly's Environmental Conservation Committee and
a Westchester Democrat. He said that the new report made clear the
importance of intensifying efforts to discourage people from eating
fish caught in the river.
</P>
<P>
   ``These fish are being eaten by people, particularly poor people
relying on the river for food,'' Brodsky said.

PINCH-HIT LUNGE LIFTS METS OVER BREWERS, 6-5
</HEADLINE>
   (cb) 
 By JASON DIAMOS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MILWAUKEE _ The day after the day that Manager Bobby Valentine
called the best of the year for the New York Mets, they were
suddenly on the verge of one of their worst days.
</P>
<P>
   Three innings from a three-game road sweep of the Milwaukee
Brewers, and with their ace on the mound, the Mets let a 5-1 lead
slip away.
</P>
<P>
   ``They didn't hit one ball to blacken your eye,'' an incredulous
Al Leiter said after the Brewers had dinked their way to four runs
on six hits in the bottom of the seventh inning against Leiter and
Greg McMichael to erase the four-run lead.
</P>
<P>
   But after Wednesday's doubleheader sweep here, Valentine also
said that maybe the pendulum had swung back in his team's favor.
That certainly seemed the case Thursday as the Mets rallied for a
6-5 victory on Matt Franco's pinch-hit, run-scoring single over the
bag at third in the top of the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's what you call an emergency swing,'' Franco said of his
check-swing thrust at a slider from Chad Fox that was inches above
the ground. The hesitant lunge at the 2-2 pitch on the outside
corner was protective more than anything else.
</P>
<P>
   The ball spun up the third-base line and over the bag, past the
reach of Jeff Cirillo and into left field, scoring Mike Piazza from
second base with the winning run.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was probably the ugliest swing I had all year,'' Franco
said. ``I just hit it in the perfect spot.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a joke,'' Fox said. ``And he knew it was a joke. He was
on first base laughing.''
</P>
<P>
   After John Franco closed out his 20th save with a perfect ninth,
the Mets (52-46) _ who won 8 of 9 games from the Brewers this
season _ were laughing all the way to Chicago, where they will
begin a four-game series with Friday's doubleheader against the
Cubs.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago leads the Mets by three and one-half games in the
wild-card race. The victory was the Mets' fourth in a row and sixth
in their last eight games. Before that, they had dropped 17 of 25.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you turn the calendar and get into another week, things
happen differently,'' Valentine said Thursday. ``I guarantee you,
two weeks ago, when they got those four bloop hits to tie it, we're
not going to get a bloop hit down the line to win it. Things are
going our way now. We got some breaks today.''
</P>
<P>
   Every hunch Valentine played proved correct. A double steal on a
3-1 pitch, a count on which Valentine rarely gambles, led to the
Mets' third run.
</P>
<P>
   Then Valentine sent McMichael (2-3) back out to pitch the eighth
after the seventh-inning collapse. And the right-handed reliever,
whom the Mets traded to Los Angeles on June 4, then got back on
July 10, responded with a perfect inning.
</P>
<P>
   In his second start back from the disabled list, Leiter had
allowed just one run and three hits over his first six innings. The
Mets _ who had received runs batted in from Carlos Baerga, Rey
Ordonez, Todd Hundley, Brian McRae and Butch Huskey _ appeared on
their way to an easy victory.
</P>
<P>
   But Leiter began to labor in the seventh. After allowing a
two-out, run-scoring, bloop single to Marquis Grissom on his 118th
pitch, Leiter was done.
</P>
<P>
   On came McMichael, who fired a two-strike wild pitch over
Piazza's head to make it 5-3. Two pitches later, Jeff Cirillo
grounded a run-scoring single to left, and it was a one-run game.
John Jaha and Jeromy Burnitz followed with bloop singles, and the
game was tied.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't really care about how Chad Fox feels,'' Leiter said of
Franco's blooper. ``I saw five or six in a row behind me and Mac.''
</P>
<P>
   After Milwaukee left-hander Mike Myers struck out John Olerud to
open the top of the ninth, Piazza just missed Myers' head a line
single up the middle for his third hit of the day. Up stepped
Bernard Gilkey and his .229 batting average.
</P>
<P>
   But Myers hit Gilkey on the left shin with an 0-2 pitch. And the
Mets had runners on first and second with one out.
</P>
<P>
   Valentine sent the right-handed-hitting Todd Pratt up to
pinch-hit. Milwaukee Manager Phil Garner called on the right-handed
Fox. Valentine responded by pinch-hitting Matt Franco for Pratt,
even though Valentine later called Pratt his hottest hitter.
</P>
<P>
   Franco, meanwhile, was 4 for 25 as a pinch-hitter this season,
after leading the Mets in pinch-hits a year ago. Franco quickly
fell behind, 0-2. ``I knew I was in trouble, but I didn't panic,''
he said. After taking two balls and lining a foul, Franco took one
last forgettable swing _ and found himself on first base, joking
with Mookie Wilson, the coach there.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just had a feeling,'' Valentine said later. ``And I lucked
out. It wasn't the greatest at-bat. But it sure was a productive
one.''

AUSTRALIA RALLIES TO SPOIL PUERTO RICO'S HOPES FOR FINAL 
</HEADLINE>
  (cb) 
 By ED GUZMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It took less than five minutes, but that was all
Australia needed to snatch away from Puerto Rico a spot in the
final of the Goodwill Games basketball competition at Madison
Square Garden.
</P>
<P>
   Australia scored 14 unanswered points in the first 4 minutes 38
seconds of the second half to turn a 44-41 halftime lead into a
68-41 margin on the way to a runaway 86-74 victory that clinched
for the Australians a spot in Friday night's championship game
against either the United States or Lithuania.
</P>
<P>
   The loss was an uncharacteristic performance by Puerto Rico.
Guard Eddie Casiano, who was averaging 24.7 points a game in the
tournament, made only 5 of 16 shots and finished with 12 points.
Puerto Rico also committed 20 turnovers.
</P>
<P>
   It was Australia, however, that was missing the shots early,
while the Puerto Rican center Jose Ortiz was scoring 12 points in
the game's first 9 minutes on his way to 14 first-half points.
After falling behind by 26-18, however, Australia got back into
things with a vengeance, as two resounding slam dunks by Chris
Anstey sparked a 12-2 run that was capped by Anthony Ronaldson's
3-pointer.
</P>
<P>
   Guard Shane Heal led Australia with 13 first-half points as he
connected on three of Australia's seven 3-pointers. Even though
Puerto Rico shot a solid 54.3 percent from the floor, to
Australia's 45.9 percent, Puerto Rico trailed at halftime.
</P>
<P>
   Like Casiano, Andrew Gaze, Australia's sharp-shooting guard, was
having a poor shooting night, too, making only 2 of 10 shots in the
game and scoring 10 of his 15 points from the free throw line. But
unlike the problems Puerto Rico faced without Casiano's points,
Australia was able to find other offensive resources. Anthony
Ronaldson, who had a total of 24 points in the three previous
games, exploded for 20 points, including a key 3-pointer in his
team's run at the start of the second half.
</P>
<P>
   Ortiz could not match his explosive first half and fouled out
with a game-high 23 points with 5:19 left.
</P>
<P>
   Australian forward Andrew Vlahov fouled Jerome Mincy hard into
the Australian bench with 11:06 left in the game, instigating some
shoving. Vlahov and Mincy were each assessed a technical foul.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of how his coach, Barry Barnes, had inspired the team
for the second-half burst, Vlahov said, ``Basically he thought we
played conservative in the first half and he told us to loosen up,
because when we get rolling, we get rolling.''

2 COMMODITIES TRADERS PLEAD GUILTY IN SCHEME 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Conn., Fla.)  (mk) 
 By BENJAMIN WEISER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Two commodities traders who grew up as close friends
in Connecticut pleaded guilty Thursday to conspiring to profit from
the confidential trading strategies of a major investment company.
</P>
<P>
   Each of the defendants, Andrew Rhee and Thomas Kelly, could face
up to five years in prison and a fine of $250,000 on one count of
conspiracy each to commit wire fraud, an assistant U.S. attorney,
David Lewis, said in U.S. District Court in Manhattan. They could
also be forced to pay restitution, Lewis said.
</P>
<P>
   The men earned $4.7 million in illicit profits from their
scheme, the government said.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors outlined a case in court papers that involved ``an
elaborate `front running' scheme'' in which the defendants
piggybacked their own deals onto the confidential strategies of the
investment concern, John W. Henry &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly, 32, worked for the company as a commodities trader from
1995 to early 1998, and Rhee, also 32, ran his own trading company.
</P>
<P>
   In court Thursday, Kelly admitted to Judge Robert Patterson that
he had passed the confidential data to Rhee, and Rhee told the
judge that he had used the information from Kelly to make the
trades that gave the men their illegal profits.
</P>
<P>
   When an investment company like John Henry trades in commodities
like corn or soybeans, it often buys or sells so much at one time
that the price goes up or down. The defendants used their knowledge
of the company's trading strategy to profit from those price
movements, the government said.
</P>
<P>
   In court papers, the government outlined a trail of
circumstantial evidence.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Kelly, who worked a day shift at John Henry's
headquarters in Boca Raton, Fla., was observed on Dec. 17 _ a day
he was supposedly on vacation _ entering the John Henry office
unexpectedly about 8 P.M. for no work-related reason, prosecutors
said.
</P>
<P>
   He was then observed examining trading sheets that set forth
John Henry's trading plans for the next day, the government said.
Prosecutors did not say who observed him.
</P>
<P>
   On the next day, the investment concern made a purchase of corn
futures contracts, which promise the delivery of a specific amount
of corn at a specific price on a specific date. Rhee also purchased
corn futures that day, prosecutors said, and later sold them for a
profit of about $48,000.
</P>
<P>
   On another occasion, Dec. 4, 1996, Kelly left a black-tie dinner
and returned to his office, still wearing his tuxedo, even though
he was not expected or required to be at work that night.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier that day, the John Henry management had decided to
liquidate a particularly large number of commodity positions, and
Kelly spent one hour that evening in the trading area, where he was
in a position to confirm the company's trading plans, prosecutors
asserted in court papers.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, John Henry made a trade in coffee futures, and so
did Rhee, prosecutors said.
</P>
<P>
   In all, the government said, Rhee, trading on information
provided illegally by Kelly, executed more than 130 trades in
futures for gold, silver, copper, sugar, coffee, cattle, crude oil
and other commodities from the United States and six other
countries.
</P>
<P>
   Rhee paid Kelly at least $300,000 and also paid many of his
bills, including more than $32,000 that Kelly owed to an interior
decorator, the government said.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors said that the scheme depended on Kelly's access to
strategies developed by John Henry's sophisticated computer
modeling programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew that information was confidential to John Henry, and I
should not have disclosed it to anyone,'' Kelly told Judge
Patterson.
</P>
<P>
   Rhee also acknowledged in court that he had been aware he was
taking advantage of John Henry's confidential data.
</P>
<P>
   ``I intentionally used this information to make trading profits,
which I shared equally with Kelly,'' said Rhee, who is a graduate
of New York University School of Law.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Aronica, the lawyer for Kelly, and Barry Bohrer, the
lawyer for Rhee, said their clients would have no comment. Both men
are free on $1 million bond, pending their sentencing on Oct. 9.
Kelly lives in Darien, Conn.; Rhee lives in Miami Beach.
</P>
<P>
   John Henry's general counsel, David Kozak, said by telephone
that the company cooperated with the federal investigation and was
``glad that this is being resolved.''
</P>
<P>
   In a separate action, the Commodities Futures Trading Commission
sued both men Thursday in U.S. District Court in Manhattan, seeking
fines and other penalties in connection with the scheme.

FIGHT-GAME FAULTS REACH RACETRACKS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Coding removed) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   At Del Mar, the purse is raised from $150,000 to $250,000 for
Saturday's San Diego Handicap, as a racetrack press release phrases
it, ``in anticipation of'' Silver Charm running. At Monmouth Park
in New Jersey, the purse is raised from $250,000 to $500,000 and
the distance is changed from 1 1/16 to 1[ miles for the Aug. 30
Iselin Handicap so that Skip Away will enter.
</P>
<P>
   And in general, horse racing feels more like boxing every day.
</P>
<P>
   As if the two ancient sports didn't have enough problems in
common, including public suspicion of the results and the
widespread perception of inhumanity. Now, more and more, horses'
handlers imitate fight managers by demanding as much money as
possible for races posing as little risk as possible, and tracks
imitate fight promoters by paying. The upshot: The showdowns the
fans want to watch rarely happen.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to blame owners and trainers for cashing in on the
drawing power of their marquee horses, whose careers can end at any
moment.
</P>
<P>
   Less understandable is the thinking of track executives. Raising
a purse to attract Silver Charm, the popular 1997 Kentucky Derby
winner, or Skip Away, the nation's top-ranked thoroughbred,
guarantees a bigger crowd for one day. But it takes money away from
purses for everyday races, cheats history and the public out of the
talked-about matchups upon which the sport was founded, and
encourages horse owners to think future purses are negotiable as
well.
</P>
<P>
   It's worthwhile if a track sweetens the pot to encourage two or
more ``name'' horses to race against each other, as Santa Anita did
in 1995, boosting its Derby from $500,000 to $700,000 on the
condition that the field included four winners of graded stakes at
one mile or longer.
</P>
<P>
   It's shortsighted if a track sweetens the pot so that a single
famous horse will liven up an otherwise drab race, creating a
mismatch.
</P>
<P>
   (And it's worse than that when the famous horse proceeds to lose
the race because he isn't ``cranked up,'' as Silver Charm did in
last month's Stephen Foster Handicap, which Churchill Downs
inflated from $500,000 to $750,000.)
</P>
<P>
   Some have criticized the San Diego Handicap purse increase
because Silver Charm is owned by Bob and Beverly Lewis, and Bob
Lewis is chairman of Thoroughbred Owners of California, which had
to approve the change. Others have pointed out that Silver Charm
probably would have run in the San Diego even without the purse
increase. But Lewis' conflict of interest and the question of
necessity are secondary concerns.
</P>
<P>
   When the fledgling National Thoroughbred Racing Association
becomes a full-fledged governing body, it should exert some
influence over scheduling and purses, encouraging tracks to raise
purses only to increase _ rather than dilute _ competition.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, the NTRA might as well be the WBO.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; The weekend: &LR;  Silver Charm drew post 6, one from the outside,
and will carry 125 pounds, giving away eight to 15, for the San
Diego on Saturday. He and jockey Gary Stevens figure to sit off the
lead, to be set by Hal's Pal or Mud Route, early in the 1 1/16-mile
race, a prep for the 1\-mile Pacific Classic.
</P>
<P>
   Among the weekend's four stakes at Del Mar, the other big one is
the Bing Crosby Handicap on Sunday. Son of a Pistol, coming off
back-to-back stakes victories, and Gold Land, the '95 Bing Crosby
winner, are among seven likely entrants in one of the top sprints
of the summer.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Claim to fame: &LR;  Of the two winners in the divided Oceanside
Stakes on Wednesday, Ladies Din was the more impressive, but
Scooter Brown had the more interesting background.
</P>
<P>
   Scooter Brown, a 3-year-old gelding by Fly Till Dawn, has run
for four trainers already. He was claimed in consecutive maiden
races at Santa Anita, for $50,000 by Bob Baffert from Bob Hess Jr.,
then for $62,500 by John Sadler from Baffert.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was probably 20th on Baffert's depth chart,'' Sadler joked
after the Oceanside, Scooter Brown's fourth win in six starts since
the claim. ``He had so many great 3-year-olds, I think he had to
run one of them for a high (claiming price).''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Comedown: &LR;  After the full program on opening day, fields of
seven or fewer horses account for half the races Thursday and
today.
</P>
<P>
   Del Mar racing director Tom Robbins said he thinks the horse
shortage will be temporary, caused by the late arrival of some
barns and by a strong finish at Hollywood Park.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope it's not a cause for concern,'' Robbins said.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Notes: &LR;  Two memories of Brian Mayberry, who died Monday at 60:
1. Despite being a third-generation racehorse trainer, and thus a
part of one of the world's more insular subcultures, he had an
active, broad mind. A conversation with Brian invariably turned to
politics or something else outside the track. 2. That didn't make
him any less passionate about racing. I'm thinking about a
horsemen's association meeting, in the stately Santa Anita turf
club a few years ago, where Mayberry rose to speak, went on a
profane, five-minute rant and stormed out, disgusted by the
proceedings. Of course, he might have had one or two.... Defying
our prediction, the Del Mar race timer did not malfunction on
opening day. On the other hand, the fire alarms kept going off
accidentally.... Said Bill Kingston, of the Hollywood Park
promotions department, during an appearance on intertrack TV
Monday: ``Thanks, one and all, to all you racing fans. It's because
of your support that this great racing industry survives.''
Survives? Thank you, Bill, for that cheery message.
