<HEADLINE> US Consumer Prices Up 0.1 Percent in May </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 17 (Xinhua) -- U.S. consumer prices increased
by a small 0.1 percent in May, the third consecutive increase,
the U.S. Labor Department reported today.
</P>
<P>
The tiny gain in the U.S. Consumer Prices Index (CPI) brought
the seasonally adjusted annual rate of inflation for the year to
just 1.4 percent, less than half of the 3.3 percent price gain for
all of last year.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that it was more evidence that U.S. inflation
remained subdued despite a strong economic growth during the last
three months of 1996 and first three months of this year.
</P>
<P>
The report showed that the slow increase of the CPI in the U.S.
last month mainly resulted from a 2.4 percent drop in energy
prices, the third decline in a row and the largest in six years.
But food prices were up by 0.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
Excluding the volatile food and energy sectors, the so-called
core prices rose a modest 0.2 percent last month.
</P>
<P>
This measure of so-called core inflation, which economists
believe to be a better measure of price trends, has been rising at
a 2.6 percent annual rate through May, the same as the core
increase for all of last year.

<HEADLINE> United States Beats China in World Youth Soccer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ALOR SETAR, Malaysia, June 17 (Xinhua) -- A last-minute goal
from Brian West gave the United States a 1-0 victory over China in
a Group C match at the World Youth Soccer Championship here on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
West, at 18 the youngest player in the American camp, blasted a
small-angle shot from the left in the box after a previous shot
was deflected from Chinese goalie Li Leilei.
</P>
<P>
West, a student from University of Virginia who also scored the
winner in the 1-0 win over China in a friendly game in San Diego
in March, played only the last 10 minutes.
</P>
<P>
American coach Jay Hoffman said West was still recovering from
a loose bowel.
</P>
<P>
China dominated most of match, especially the scoreless first
half which saw 12 attempts on the goal.
</P>
<P>
The team apparently lost much of steam in the second half.
After the West goal, they tried in vain in the last desperate
offence 30 seconds before the whistle.
</P>
<P>
Chinese coach Zhu Guanghu said, "The key to our loss today was
that we were loose in midfield. We also had problem in the
physical endurance in the second half.
</P>
<P>
"Everyone is feeling bad because we lost the game. But we would
play better in the coming two games," Zhu added.
</P>
<P>
Americans Chad McCarthy and Benjamin Oslen received yellow
cards from the referee Amand Ancion of Belgium. China's Zhang Ran,
Zhengyi and Zhang Xiaorui also got bookings.
</P>
<P>
In another Group C match, 1993 championship runner-up Ghana
beat Ireland 2-1.
</P>
<P>
Ghana's Bashiru Gambo scored the opening goal in 28th minute
but Trevor Molloy of Ireland levelled the score seven minutes
after the break.
</P>
<P>
Ghana's Mohamed-Kamil Mouktar netted the winning goal in the
67th minute with a deft placement.
</P>
<P>
Ghana, runners-up to Brazil in 1993 championships in Australia,
will meet China next on Thursday. Ireland takes on the United
States on the same day.
</P>
<P>
Also on Tuesday, Asian champions South Korea and South Africa,
the African runners-up, played a goalless draw while Brazil
defeated France 3-0 in two group B matches at Kuching.
</P>
<P>
Alex DeSouza scored in the fifth minute to put Brazil 1-0 ahead
before the break before Adailton Martins netted 16 minutes into
the second half.
</P>
<P>
France's Michel Silvestre tapped the ball into his own goal in
the last minute when defending a Brazilian attack.
</P>
<P>
In the only group A match, Uruguay drubbed Belgium 3-0 in Shah
Alam.
</P>
<P>
The South American side scored its first goal in the 40th
minute when Inti Mezzetta Podesta fired a shot deflected off the
upright post but which he neatly slotted in on the second chance.
</P>
<P>
Walter Coelho's double, one in the 55th minute and other 77th,
made it 3-0 for Uruguay.
</P>
<P>
Uruguay plays its next game against Malaysia on Thursday while
Morocco faces Belgium.
</P>
<P>
The 24 teams here are split into six groups and the top two
teams in each group plus four best third placers go into a
eliminatory second round. The final is to be played July 5 in the
Shah Alam stadium.

<HEADLINE> Spokesman on Cyprus's Purchase of Russian Missiles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, June 17 (Xinhua) -- It is the Cypriot government that
will decide if it would go ahead with a deal on the purchase of a
Russian surface-to-air missile system, a government spokesman said
here today.
</P>
<P>
At a daily press briefing, spokesman Manolis Christofides
said his government "has the inalienable right to decide if and
when progress is made toward a comprehensive settlement of the
Cyprus problem to warrant cancellation" of the missiles it bought
earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman's remarks came in response to statements by
Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeni Primakov and U.S. State
Department spokesman Nicholas Burns.
</P>
<P>
Primakov said after a meeting with Cypriot Foreign Minister
Ioannis Kasoulides in Moscow Monday that the Russian-made
anti-aircraft missile system S-300 will be dispatched to Cyprus in
accordance with an agreement signed by the two countries earlier
this year, unless an agreement for the island's complete
demilitarization is reached.
</P>
<P>
The Russian minister also noted that Russia fully backs the
island's complete demilitarization as proposed by Cypriot
President Glafcos Clerides.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on Primakov's statement, Burns reiterated U.S.
administration's opposition to the purchase of the Russian-made
anti-aircraft missile system by the Cypriot government.
</P>
<P>
The Cypriot government's decision to purchase the Russian
missiles in January came under fire from the U.S. and some other
foreign governments, who feared this move will cause retaliatory
measures from Turkey and increase tension in the region.
</P>
<P>
Cypriot President Glafcos Clerides has reassured worrying
diplomats here that no missile components will be delivered to
Cyprus in 16 months.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Greek Cypriot south and
Turkish Cypriot north since 1974 when the Turkish troops invaded
and took control of the northern third of the island following a
short-lived Athens-backed coup.
</P>
<P>
Nine years after the division of the island, the Turkish
Cypriot side established a breakaway state "the Turkish Republic
of Northern Cyprus," which is recognized only by Turkey.

</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Icelandair to Order RB211-535 Engines for New Boeing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 17 (Xinhua) -- Rolls-Royce is set to win orders
worth up to 200 million US dollars following Icelandair's decision
to buy four more Boeing 757 airliners, Rolls-Royce announced
today.
</P>
<P>
With the new order, Icelandair becomes the second airline, and
the first scheduled carrier, to select the latest 757-300 which
has a stretched fuselage to increase passenger payload, at the
same time reducing seat-mile operating costs.
</P>
<P>
An existing operator of four Rolls-Royce powered 757-200s,
Icelandair will use its new aircraft on the high-density routes to
North America, said a press release by the company.
</P>
<P>
A senior official from Rolls-Royce said, "Icelandair is one of
the oldest and most experienced airlines, so this new order is a
great endorsement of both the Boeing 757 and its Rolls-Royce
powerplant, RB211-535E4."
</P>
<P>
Deliveries of the airline's first two 757-200s are in
1998-1999, while the 757-300s with conversion rights to the -300
standard, have slots between 2000-2006, said Rolls-Royce.
</P>
<P>
Icelandair has 40 years' relationship with Rolls-Royce, and its
first Rolls-Royce powered aircraft was the Viscount in 1957,
followed by the CL44 and Fokker F27 in the sixties, with the
Boeing 757 coming into service in 1990.

<HEADLINE> US Economist: Euro May Be 1st Real Competitor to Dollar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, June 17 (Xinhua) -- A successful single European currency
could pose the first real competitor to the U.S. dollar as the
internationally dominant legal tender, a U.S economist was quoted
today by a German newspaper as saying.
</P>
<P>
The creation of the planned common European currency, known as
the Euro, would be the most important event in the development of
the international currency system since the introduction of the
flexible exchange rates in the early 1970s, U.S. economist Fred
Bergsten was quoted by the German business daily Handelsblatt as
saying.
</P>
<P>
He said that although the dollar is still the dominant foreign
currency which settles about 40 to 60 percent of the world goods
trade, the European Union (EU) states as a whole have already
outnumbered the United States in economic output and foreign
trade.
</P>
<P>
According to a recent study conducted by Bergsten, the EU
boasts a total gross domestic product of 8,400 billion dollars
against 7,200 billion dollars of the U.S.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Europe also chalked up an international trade of
1,900 billion dollars against 1,700 billion dollars registered in
the U.S.
</P>
<P>
In terms of ratio, the EU currently has a 31 percent share in
world output and a 20 percent share in world trade while the
comparable U.S. figures are 27 percent and 18 percent.
</P>
<P>
Bergsten noted that the increasing importance of Europe has
posed a big challenge to the United States, especially given the
fact that the U.S. is at present the world's biggest debtor nation
which is running up a trade deficit of over 200 billion dollars
annually.
</P>
<P>
"The consequences for the international currency system are
already perceptible even before the Euro is created," Bergsten
said.
</P>
<P>
"A successful Euro will come as the first real competitor to
the dollar since the U.S. currency replaced the British pound
sterling as the dominant foreign currency between the two world
wars," he said in conclusion.

<HEADLINE> New Generation Adour Engine to Be Certificated in 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 17 (Xinhua) -- A new version of the Adour engine
has been launched by its Anglo-French makers, Rolls-Royce
Turbomeca, according to a press release here today.
</P>
<P>
The Adour 900 will embody the most modern technological
features that will ensure the engine continues to meet the most
challenging demands of military trainer and light combat
operations well into the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
The main features of the Adour 900 are a new design of
high-pressure compressor drum, a longer-life combustion chamber
and the very latest single crystal blading technology in both the
rotating and static aerofoils throughout the turbine, the company
said.
</P>
<P>
One notable feature will be the adoption of a FADEC
(full-authority digital electronic control system, including
integrated engine health monitoring. This will give the Adour 900
carefree handling, while reducing pilot workload and engine
maintenance back on the ground, it added.
</P>
<P>
Today's Adour powers all variants of the world-renowned Hawk
trainer/light combat aircraft, and the US Navy's T-45A Goshawk
advanced trainer.
</P>
<P>
Well over a million hours of service operation has been logged
by these single-engined aircraft, while the engine has accumulated
a total of 5 million flying hours in all aircraft types.
</P>
<P>
Rolls-Royce and Turbomeca have consistently taken a derivative
approach to product improvements by applying new technology to
ensure the Adour retains its competitive edge.
</P>
<P>
Both companies will participate fully in the Adour 900's
development program which will result in the engine's full
certification in 2000, according to Rolls-Royce.
</P>
<P>
John Ferrie, who will be chairman of Rolls-Royce Turbomeca next
month, said, "The end result of the total enhancement package will
be an engine that will operate for twice as long between overhauls
based on typical existing Adour engine usage patterns."
</P>
<P>
"All reliability features of the existing Adour will be
retained, while the improvement modifications will be capable of
retrofit to other Adour variants in service with customers today,"
he added.

<HEADLINE> Ties With Taiwan Brings Unrest to Sao Tome &AMP; </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, June 17 (Xinhua) -- The establishment of "diplomatic
ties" with China's Taiwan Province is bringing unrest to Sao Tome
&AMP; Principle, a high-ranking official said here today.
</P>
<P>
Carlos Braganca, Consultant to Raul Braganca Neto, Prime
Minister of Sao Tome &AMP; Principe, said the unrest is caused by the
presidential decree on the establishment of "diplomatic
relations" with Taiwan, as many government institutions oppose
the move.
</P>
<P>
Carlos made the remarks after extending a letter of Sao Tome &AMP;
Principe Prime Minister Raul Braganca Neto to his Angolan
counterpart Franca Van-Dunem.
</P>
<P>
He said that the letter is mainly about the island country's
unstable political situation.
</P>
<P>
The agreement on establishing relations with Taiwan, which has
not got the approval by the government, is unlawful, the official
said.
</P>
<P>
Carlos said a compromise that could be accepted by
most of the institutions must be found to get rid of the crisis.
</P>
<P>
Sao Tome &AMP; Principe is an island country in the Gulf of
Guinea. A former Portuguese colony, it declared independence in
1975.

<HEADLINE> Israeli-Palestinian Clashes Continue in Hebron </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 17 (Xinhua) -- At least 19 Palestinian
protesters were injured by Israeli troops in the West Bank city
Hebron in the fourth consecutive day of clashes today.
</P>
<P>
Israeli state television quoted Palestinian hospital sources in
Hebron as saying that one 14-year-old boy was in critical
condition after sustaining serious wounds from rubber bullets
fired by Israeli soldiers.
</P>
<P>
The rioting, which occurred near the Jewish neighborhood Beit
Hadassah, began when young Palestinian protesters burned an
Israeli flag and threw stones and fire bombs at Israeli soldiers
guarding the Jewish quarter. Israeli soldiers fired rubber bullets
and tear gas to disperse the protesters.
</P>
<P>
One Israeli soldier and 15 Palestinians were wounded Monday in
street battles in Hebron. In Sunday's clashes, there were two
Israeli soldiers and 15 Palestinian protesters wounded in the
volatile city.
</P>
<P>
Israeli army today repeated the accusation against Palestinian
police for ignoring agreements to subdue the riots. Army officials
also expressed the fear about escalation of violence if the
situation continued.
</P>
<P>
Jewish settlers meanwhile complained that the Israeli troops
were not tough enough to restore order in the city.
</P>
<P>
The clashes in Hebron followed last Thursday's violence near
the Gush Katif settlement in the Gaza Strip where Palestinians
gathered to protest Israel's confiscation of their land. Israeli
soldiers fired tear gas and used force to drive away protesters
who tore down the fences erected by the settlers on the disputed
land.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, clashes erupted again in Gush Katif when Palestinian
protesters broke into the settlement trying to destroy crops. One
Palestinian was wounded by a Jewish settler who fired his pistol
from his tractor at the Palestinian crowds.
</P>
<P>
Israel Radio reported dozens of Palestinians, most of them
policemen, set up tents today at the Gush Katif junction to
protest Israel's confiscation of their land.
</P>
<P>
In an effort to calm the tense situation, members of the joint
Israeli-Palestinian Civilian Committee held a meeting with both
Palestinian and Israeli police officers to discuss the situation.
</P>
<P>
The latest wave of violence highlights the rising tension
between the two sides because of the continued deadlock in the
Israeli-Palestinian peace process. Peace talks have been frozen
since Israel began building the controversial Har Homa settlement
in East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Despite intensive mediation efforts launched by the U.S. and
Egypt, there is no immediate sign of bringing the peace process
back on track. This has heightened the fear about widespread
renewed violence in the Palestinian territories.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Government Urged to Punish Sexual </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, June 17 (Xinhua) -- The Women's Department of the Zimbabwe
Congress of Trade Unions today said the government should come up
with a law requiring that anybody found guilty of plying sexual
harassment at workplaces should be fired.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a gender, labour and democratisation workshop in
Harare, Head of the Department Miriro Pswarai said the cases of women
being sexually harassed at workplaces were on the increase both in
the private and public sectors.
</P>
<P>
In the absence of a protective legislation, most suffering women
were losing their jobs when they tried to speak out, she said.
</P>
<P>
She said, ''we need legislation to protect women because the
environment we are working in now is threatening and intimidating.''
</P>
<P>
''The harasser should be promptly fired if proven guilty, and the
matter be reported to police,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
The men, she said, were easily promoted while women could only go
up the ladder should they give in to sexual abuse.
</P>
<P>
By failing to come up with relevant legislation, the government
was protecting some perpetrators, she said. enditem

by 20 percent in the first quarter of this year, according to an
OAPEC monthly report published today.
</P>
<P>
The report said the prices of OAPEC's basket of seven crudes
stood at 18.6 dollars per barrel in March, a drop of 4.9 dollars
per barrel compared to last December.
</P>
<P>
The OAPEC, founded in 1968 in Lebanon, now has 10 member states
including Algeria, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Egypt,
Kuwait, Iraq, Qatar, Libya, Saudi Arabia and Syria.
</P>
<P>
The increase of world oil supply, such as the return of Iraq to
world oil market under a U.N. oil-for-food deal and overproduction
by some OPEC members, and the decrease of demand were the factors
causing the decline of oil prices, the report said.
</P>
<P>
OPEC's 12 members have increased production by about one
million barrels per day (bpd) since November last year, reaching
27.05 million bpd in April this year, according to Kuwaiti oil
sources.
</P>
<P>
An extra 400,000 bpd of output from OPEC might be forthcoming
in the second half of the year, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
Analysts expect Algeria, Qatar, Nigeria, Venezuela and
Indonesia might all add production capacity this year.
</P>
<P>
OPEC is expected to leave unchanged official quotas under its
25.03 million bpd ceiling when it meets in Vienna on June
25.

<HEADLINE> EU Risks Agreeing to Watered-Down Treaty as Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMSTERDAM, June 17 (Xinhua) -- European Union leaders watered
down an already modest proposal for a new EU treaty today, dashing
the high hopes to take ambitious steps in European integration.
</P>
<P>
Diplomats said the negotiations were running behind schedule
and some delegations warned that the talks, on the second day of
the EU summit in Amsterdam, could run well into late evening.
</P>
<P>
In the latest draft treaty presented by the Dutch EU
presidency, Britain, Ireland and Denmark were given opt-outs in EU
policies aimed to prompt closer cooperation in crime fighting and
immigration policy.
</P>
<P>
The leaders, drafting a new EU treaty for the 21st century,
failed to take major steps towards building a common foreign and
defense policy, by agreeing to appoint the unknown
secretary-general of the Council of Ministers, instead of a
high-level figure desired by France, to steer EU foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
Under the draft text, EU states would agree to cooperate more
closely in such areas as asylum, immigration, visa policy and
crime fighting, but the veto remains in the fields of asylum,
immigration and refugee policy because of national sensitivities.
</P>
<P>
The Schengen agreement, which lifts border checks within most
of the EU states, would be incorporated into the EU, while
allowing Britain and Ireland, linked to the former through a
passport union, to retain their border checks and the right to set
their own visa, immigration and asylum policy.
</P>
<P>
Denmark's opt-out is a reiteration of a previous one,
reflecting its constitutional problems with passing sovereignty to
EU institutions. However, as a member of the Schengen group, it is
expected to remain part of the border-free zone.
</P>
<P>
On defense, Britain, Denmark and the bloc's neutrals -- Sweden,
Ireland, Finland and Austria -- were resisting calls for
integration of the Western European Union (WEU) defense club into
the bloc, seen by others as a step towards true integration.
</P>
<P>
The language in the text had been toned down, saying only that
the WEU might one day be in the EU.
</P>
<P>
The leaders were set to agree that the WEU would remain
independent, sub-contracted to carry out humanitarian,
peacekeeping and crisis management mission for the EU.
</P>
<P>
One of the toughest fights would be over flexibility, the idea
of letting some integrate faster that other. A number of
countries, worried that they would be left behind by eager
integrationists, want individual member states to have a veto over
such plans, but Germany, France and others are adamantly opposed
to this.
</P>
<P>
French President Jacques Chirac told his colleagues Monday that
flexibility "only made sense if decisions are taken by majority."

<HEADLINE> Iraq Asks U.N. to Open Fourth Border Point </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, June 17 (Xinhua) -- Iraq has officially asked the
U.N. to open a fourth border point for transporting goods across
the Iraqi-Syrian border, the Iraqi News Agency (INA) reported
today.
</P>
<P>
The INA said Nizar Hamdoon, Iraqi ambassador to the U.N., made
this demand in a letter to the chairman of the U.N. Sanctions
Committee on Iraq on Monday.
</P>
<P>
He told the chairman that the fourth border point will be
opened at al-Waleed Abu Shamat on the Iraqi-Syrian border in line
with its "oil-for-food" with the U.N.
</P>
<P>
Three border points for transporting humanitarian goods have
been opened. They are Um Qasr Port in the south, Treibil on the
Iraqi-Jordanian border and Faida on the Iraqi-Turkish border.
</P>
<P>
Recently, Iraq has signed several contracts with Syrian
companies to import food, medicine and other daily necessities, in
a first step for the two countries to resume their normal
relations interrupted for the past 17 years.
</P>
<P>
Baghdad severed its diplomatic ties with Damascus in 1980
after the eight-year Iraq-Iran War broke out because Damascus
sided with Tehran.
</P>
<P>
Their relations further worsened when Syrian troops joined in
the Gulf War in 1991 to fight Iraq troops after their invasion of
Kuwait.

<HEADLINE> Study: Funding Problems Threaten US Higher Education </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 18 (Xinhua) -- A new study found that growing
enrollment, rising tuition and declining funding have put U.S.
colleges on a dangerous financial course and threaten to bar
millions of students from higher education.
</P>
<P>
The Rand Corp., conducting the study, said in a report that if
current campus trends continue into the next century, millions of
Americans will be denied the opportunity to go to college, the
Washington Post said today.
</P>
<P>
The Rand report concluded that neither public nor private
support of colleges is keeping pace with campus costs or student
enrollment.
</P>
<P>
It projected that by 2015, the number of full-time college
students will be 13 million, about 3 million more than now.
</P>
<P>
It noted that while the enrollment is growing, college tuition
costs are continuing to outpace inflation. Average college tuition
per student, adjusted for inflation, has nearly doubled in the
past 20 years, it said.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, allowing the situation to continue for another 20
years, the report warned, more than 6 million students will be
forced out of higher education in the United States.
</P>
<P>
The report criticized both the federal government and states
for not making stronger financial commitments to higher education
and many colleges for their financial mismanagement.
</P>
<P>
The report urged universities to define their misions more
precisely, streamline services, and do more to measure faculty
productivity.
</P>
<P>
It also recommended universities share more of each other's
resources and try to save money by relying more on new computer
technology and the Internet as tools for class instruction and
scholarly research.

<HEADLINE> Yangtze River Navigation Center Established </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, June 18 (Xinhua) -- The Yangtze River Navigation
Center was established today in Taicang, a city near the river's
mouth in east China's Jiangsu Province, to provide navigation
services for Chinese and overseas vessels.
</P>
<P>
Growing from the Navigation Station of the Yangtze River Harbor
Supervision Bureau, the center aims at conducting unified
management of navigating vessels along the longest river in China.
</P>
<P>
In the past, vessels sailing into and out of the Yangtze River
had to anchor at Liuhe Town in Taicang to wait for navigators to
board. Now, navigators are able to board the ships as they sail,
thus saving about four hours.
</P>
<P>
Along 1,300 km of the river, the Yangtze River Harbor
Supervision Bureau has established more than 20 navigation places
in the cities of Nanjing, Shanghai, Wuhan and Jiujiang. And there
is a large team of well-trained navigators.
</P>
<P>
Up to now, the navigators have led about 70,000 vessels from 59
countries and regions through the river.

<HEADLINE> Seminar on Tuberculosis Control Opens in Nepal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, June 18 (Xinhua) -- A six-day regional seminar began
here today at the SAARC Tuberculosis Center on how to control the
disease effectively.
</P>
<P>
The seminar will discuss ways to coordinate the tuberculosis
control activities of government, private and non-governmental
organizations and for the experts of SAARC countries to conduct
training activities, the official RSS news agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
Participating in the seminar are India, Nepal, the Maldives and
Pakistan, all members of the South Asian Association for Regional
Cooperation (SAARC), which also groups Bhutan, Sri Lanka and
Bangladesh.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Dirgha Singh Bam, director of the SAARC Tuberculosis Center
and the National Tuberculosis Center of Nepal, said that as the
region is home to 40 percent of the tuberculosis patients in the
world, the DOTS system that was introduced last year has been an
appropriate technology.
</P>
<P>
On the recommendation of the World Health Organization, the
Directly Observed Treatment Short Course (DOTS) method was brought
into South Asia, where 1 million people die of tuberculosis every
year.
</P>
<P>
The world today has about 10 million tuberculosis patients and
about 3 million people die of the disease every year.
</P>
<P>
In Nepal, 80,000 people suffer from tuberculosis, which is the
cause of death for 16,500 people annually.
</P>
<P>
The DOTS method has been found effective in controlling
tuberculosis as patients are given drugs under strict supervision
of doctors or health workers.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Exchange Reserves Drop in Bangladesh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh's foreign exchange
reserves stood at 1.623 billion U.S. dollars at the end of May
this year, much less than the 2.039 billion dollars at the close
of the 1995-96 fiscal year, Finance Minister Shah AMS Kibria said
here today.
</P>
<P>
The minister told the parliament that the government has
undertaken several measures to increase the level of foreign
currency reserves in the country.
</P>
<P>
The measures include removal of problems of exporters to speed
up their export activities and steps to increase remittances from
expatriates, attract foreign investment and expedite the
implementation of foreign-aided projects to ensure availability of
foreign loans.
</P>
<P>
Kibria also told the parliament that the total amount of
default loans with banks was 141.59 billion taka (about 3.29
billion dollars) up to March 1996. "Party influence and sympathy
were considered in sanctioning most of such loans," he said.
</P>
<P>
After the present government took over last June, the finance
minister said, an amount of 20.03 billion taka (about 470 million
dollars) had been reduced from the total default bank loans during
the period from January to April 30 this year.
</P>
<P>
Kibria said the government has taken several measures including
the formation of a task force and reform of law to realize the
rest of the default loans.
</P>
<P>
Bankruptcy Act, 1997 has also been enacted, which will come
into effect soon for the realization of default loans, the finance
minister added.

<HEADLINE> No Change for HK Stock Exchange Beyond 1997: Chairman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 18 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong Stock Exchange
will have no change in its trading system and regulatory standards
after Hong Kong returns to China on July 1, Dr. Edgar Wai-kin
Cheng, chairman of the Council of the Exchange said here today.
</P>
<P>
Cheng made these remarks at a forum on prospects of the Hong
Kong stock market, which was hosted by the Better Hong Kong
Foundation.
</P>
<P>
Cheng co-chaired the forum with Charles Yeh Kwong Lee, former
chairman of the Council of the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, and
Nellie K.M.Fong, J.P., chairwoman of the executive committee of
the Better Hong Kong Foundation.
</P>
<P>
The Stock Exchange of Hong Kong, which commenced trading in
April, 1986, now has a market capitalization of nearly 4,000
billion Hong Kong dollars. It ranks seventh in the world and
second in Asia.
</P>
<P>
Cheng attributed the rapid growth of the Hong Kong stock market
to a well-regulated trading system, a high degree of liquidity and
the application of the same standards to all investors and listed
companies.
</P>
<P>
"All these will not change after July 1. We will maintain all
the existing standards and make sure that the market is
transparent, orderly and fair," he said.
</P>
<P>
Responding to the question of if there is competition between
the Hong Kong Stock Exchange and the Shanghai Securities Exchange,
Charles Lee said: "We are not competing with but complementing
each other, for we have different regulatory and supervisory
systems."
</P>
<P>
He acknowledged that the Shanghai Securities Exchange has
advantages in handling domestic funds, while the Hong Kong Stock
Exchange is the right place to raise foreign capital.
</P>
<P>
He went on to say that Hong Kong could play a significant role
in raising capital for the modernization drive in inland areas,
and that the Hong Kong Stock Exchange has all along been serving
"as a link between international investors and Chinese state
enterprises."
</P>
<P>
To date, 28 enterprises from China's interior areas have been
listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, raising a total of five
billion US dollars on initial listing.
</P>
<P>
"Many (people) indeed see Hong Kong as having the potential and
capacity to become the 'Wall Street' of China in the future," Lee
said.

<P>
ISLAMABAD, June 18 (Xinhua) -- The Afghan Islamic Taliban
Militia have taken the capital city of the northern Afghan
province of Kunduz, reports reaching here said today.
</P>
<P>
The city of Kunduz, about 250 kilometers north of Kabul, fell
to the Taliban on Tuesday, the reports quoted the Taliban's
spokesman as saying.
</P>
<P>
If the reports are true, the Taliban's capture of Kunduz would
be the first major victory in northern Afghanistan since their
debacle in the northern city of Mazar-e-Sharif last month.
</P>
<P>
Briefly in May, the Taliban controlled roughly 90 percent of
Afghanistan, but a falling-out with their Uzbek allies led to
their defeat in Mazar-e-Sharif, a city some 300 kilometers north
of the Afghan capital.
</P>
<P>
Within days the Taliban were routed elsewhere in the north,
losing territory to the anti-Taliban alliance.

<HEADLINE> Anti-Extravagance Fight Yields Results in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 18 (Xinhua) -- The national anti-extravagance
fight targeting government officials has yielded positive results
in its initial stage, according to statistics from the Central
Commission for Disciplinary Inspection of the Chinese Communist
Party (CPC).
</P>
<P>
The commission put a frugality program at top of the Party's
anti-corruption drive agenda for this year at a conference
in January.
</P>
<P>
Chinese President and General Secretary of the CPC Central
Committee Jiang Zemin called for all the Party members at the
meeting to "work hard and live a plain life."
</P>
<P>
The Party central committee and the State Council also issued a
set of Regulations on Party and Government Bodies Practicing
Thrift and Preventing Extravagance and Waste.
</P>
<P>
A recent survey shows that local governments have so far saved
more than 1 billion yuan (about 120.48 million US dollars) by
putting a stop to or delaying the construction of some 80 office
buildings.
</P>
<P>
In the city of Jining in east China's Shandong Province, a
massive 12-million-yuan interior decoration project planned for an
office building was later changed to only a maintenance job, which
cost a maximum of 1 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
The central government departments and local authorities have
also saved over 10 million yuan by canceling or reducing the
number and scale of meetings.
</P>
<P>
In provinces of Guangdong, Shandong, Hubei and Sichuan and
Tianjin Municipality, more than 4,000 residential telephone lines
and 6,000 mobile phones bought with public money and in violation
of State rules, were discovered and have been removed.
</P>
<P>
Cases of a number of luxury cars used by officials were
investigated and more than 40 expensive overseas tours funded by
public coffers have been stopped prior to departure.
</P>
<P>
Local Party and government departments have stepped up their
inspection efforts in finding waste and extravagant activities
among their own, said the commission.
</P>
<P>
East China's Zhejiang Province launched a series of surprise
checkups at 1,030 luxurious hotels and recreational centers in May
to find out who were disobeying the rules. And in Hubei Province,
122 big-spending party officials were disciplined for their
actions, and 146 units were given fines totaling more than 400,000
yuan.

</P>
<P>
Koroma said those who have fled the country should come home
and assist the government in finding a solution to the current
political crisis.
</P>
<P>
The leader of the May 25 coup, who was speaking to religious
leaders, said, ''running away can never solve the problem''.
</P>
<P>
The State Radio, meanwhile, broadcast his appeals for all
Sierra Leoneans to return.
</P>
<P>
Dozens of doctors, lawyers, judges and administrators fled the
country by sea and land route to Guinea after renewed fears of
another Nigerian-led forces' attacks on the capital.
</P>
<P>
The radio called on both the Governor of the Central Bank, Steve
Swaray, and his deputy Enid Gibril to return saying their safety
is assured.
</P>
<P>
Immigration sources said up to 30,000 Sierra Leoneans are now
out of the country with the bulk in Guinea and Gambia.
</P>
<P>
Consular officials at the Guinea Embassy in Freetown said about
1,000 vehicles from Freetown had been issued with authorisation
to enter the Guinean territory.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the rebel Revolutionary United Front (RUF) issued a
statement asking Sierra Leoneans to " forgive all atrocities
committed during the six-year-long civil war.
</P>
<P>
"We did not take to the bush because we want to be barbarians
but we want to state our humanhood to a society that looked on us
as subhumans," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The statement said the RUF has not denounced attempts to bring
deposed President Kabbah back. enditem

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Senior Chinese officials from the
Party central committee and the State Council held a forum here
today together with experts on political theory to discuss Deng
Xiaoping's theories on "Peaceful reunification" and "One Country,
Two Systems."
</P>
<P>
The meeting, with 50 participants, was held at the Great Hall
of the People's new Hall of Hong Kong, which was used for the

</P>
<P>
Ding Guangen, member of the Political Bureau of the Chinese

</P>
<P>

smooth return of Hong Kong to the motherland and for maintaining
its long-term prosperity and stability since July 1.
</P>
<P>
He noted that Hong Kong's return will be an important step for

<HEADLINE> Japan's Trade Surplus More Than Triples in May </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Japan's merchandise trade surplus in
May jumped 222.2 percent from a year earlier to 738.27 billion yen
(6.5 billion U.S. dollars), the Finance Ministry said today.
</P>
<P>
The sharp surge of trade surplus reflected the yen's weakness
against the U.S. dollar, the ministry said in a preliminary report.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. dollar was once traded at as high as 127 yen in early
May, which facilitateed Japan's exports of automobiles,
semiconductors and other goods.
</P>
<P>
Of Japan's global trade in May, exports increased 20.5 percent
to 4,104.88 billion yen (36.3 billion U.S. dollars), the 22nd
consecutive monthly expansion, while imports grew 6.0 percent to
3,366.61 billion yen (29.8 billion U.S. dollars), the 37th
straight monthly rise.
</P>
<P>
Japan's politically sensitive trade surplus with the United
States totaled 322.87 billion yen (2.9 billion dollars), up 93.0
percent from a year earlier due mainly to expanding exports of
automobiles and office supplies.
</P>
<P>
Its exports to the U.S. advanced 22.9 percent to 1,104.11
billion yen (9.8 billion U.S. dollars) while imports expanded 6.8
percent to 781.24 billion yen (6.9 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Japan also posted increases in its goods trade surplus with the
European Union (EU) and Asia, the ministry said.
</P>
<P>
The surplus with the EU soared 230.5 percent to 206.56 billion
yen (1.9 billion U.S. dollars), while that with Asian countries
rose 72.8 percent to 578.02 billion yen (5.1 billion U.S.
dollars).

<HEADLINE> US Defense Secretary Ends Gulf Tour </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, June 18 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Defense Secretary William
Cohen today ended his five-day Gulf tour after leaving the
Omani capital Muscat for home.
</P>
<P>
During his visit to Oman, the last leg of his tour
which has taken him to Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Bahrain and the
United Arab Emirates (UAE), he held talks with Oman's Sultan
Qaboos and other top Omani leaders on Gulf security and the
latest developments in the Middle East region, the Omani news
agency said.
</P>
<P>
Cohen also reiterated during his visits to other Gulf
countries that the U.S. will continue to keep a strong military
presence in the region to maintain interests of the U.S. and all
its Gulf allies.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. troops will continue to stay in the Gulf region
to strengthen defense ties with the regional states and
Washington will go ahead with its long-term commitment to Gulf
security, Cohen told Gulf leaders during his first tour to the
region as U.S. defense secretary.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. military presence in the Gulf currently includes
around 20,000 troops, 26 warships and hundreds of warplanes.
</P>
<P>
Cohen also said that Washington will maintain tough policies
against Iran and Iraq, the real threats to the Gulf states claimed
by the U.S. for a long time.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. policy towards Iran would not change unless Tehran
showed a marked shift from its support for international
terrorism and its keenness to buy and develop more weapons, the
U.S. defense official repeatedly stressed during his tour.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. also favored maintaining UN sanctions against Iraq
until Baghdad complied with all 1990-1991 Gulf crisis-related UN
resolutions and the collapse of Iraq's President Saddam Hussein,
he said.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the latest developments in the Middle East peace
process, the US defense secretary explained to Gulf leaders
that a recent vote by the U.S. House of Representatives
declaring Jerusalem as Israel's unified capital is not of the
opinion of U.S. President Bill Clinton's administration.
</P>
<P>
The non-biding resolution, opposed by Bill Clinton's
administration, was passed last week and set aside 100 million
dollars to move the US embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.
The vote has sparked criticism among the Arab world.

<HEADLINE> Top Legislator Stresses Importance of Environmental Protection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 18 (Xinhua) -- The protection of the environment
and its resources should be guaranteed by law, a top Chinese
legislator said here today at a forum sponsored by the National
People's Congress, China's highest legislative body.
</P>
<P>
Environmental and resource protection is directly related to
the overall situation of China's economic growth and social
progress, and also to the well-being and development of future
generations, said Qiao Shi, chairman of the Standing Committee of
the NPC.
</P>
<P>
Since China's reform and opening-up, the protection work has
made tremendous headway as a result of more funding and increased
legal support, and the environment in some areas has been markedly
improved, said Qiao who is also a member of the Standing Committee
of the Political Bureau of the Chinese Communist Party Central
Committee.
</P>
<P>
However, the task of environmental protection on the whole
remains difficult, Qiao said, calling for the protection and
reasonable exploitation of oceans, grassland, minerals, living
things, land, water and forests.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Qiao urged local people's congresses and their
standing committees to strengthen law-enforcement in this regard.
</P>
<P>
During the five-day forum, participants said that the NPC and
lower legislative bodies should set as priority law-enforcement
inspections on arable land, trees and water.
</P>
<P>
Environmental and resource protection should be considered a
key point when appraise the work of local officials, Qiao
said. Those who are responsible for deteriorating environmental
conditions will not be promoted, and those involved in serious
cases will be removed from their posts.
</P>
<P>
Courts and procuratorates should be more active in handling
cases related to environmental and resource protection, said
participants at the forum.
</P>
<P>
In the coming years, China will purify some seriously polluted
lakes and rivers, and treat pollution in township enterprises and
urban sewage and garbage.

<HEADLINE> Canada's Wholesale Trade Up in April </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Canadian wholesale trade value
reached 16.7 billion U.S. dollars in April, three percent higher
than in the previous month, Statistics Canada said today.
</P>
<P>
The increase is in line with the strong sales recorded in the
first two months of 1997 and the upward movement that began in
early 1996, the federal agency said.
</P>
<P>
Higher sales were reported for most sectors, except for
computers and packaged software and food products.
</P>
<P>
Motor vehicles and parts and industrial machinery and
equipments were the biggest gainers, contributing over two-thirds
to the total increase, mainly due to renewed consumer confidence
and lower interest rates.
</P>
<P>
Canada's wholesale trade has accumulatively expanded 15.8
percent since it started picking up in January 1996.

<HEADLINE> Choice by Ann Tze-Kai (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 18 (Xinhua) -- For 85-year-old Ann Tze-Kai, a
prominent Hong Kong businessman, it's again the time for him to
contemplate the future of Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
But this time, his frame of mind is totally different from that
48 years ago.
</P>
<P>
When the People's Republic of China was founded in 1949, Ann,
just like many other residents in Hong Kong, asked himself where
Hong Kong, closely linked with the inland areas, would move.
</P>
<P>
Having gone through all the humility and hardships as a result
of the Japanese invasion and occupation of the Chinese mainland
and Hong Kong during the 1937-1945 period, Ann was so excited that
the Chinese nation had finally stood up. But he had just started
his textile industry then, and what if Hong Kong was turned into a
battlefield again?
</P>
<P>
"Every Chinese hopes that Hong Kong will return to China at an
early date, and that their motherland will become strong," Ann
said. "But how should Hong Kong return to the motherland in a way
that will benefit both the state and Hong Kong? I was really
unsure of that then."
</P>
<P>
To the surprise of Ann and all other Hong Kong residents, the
People's Liberation Army did not advance into Hong Kong. Moreover,
the first generation of leaders of new China explicitly put
forward the policy of making full use of Hong Kong, and
formulated a series of special policies on safeguarding Hong
Kong's stability and prosperity. To this end, the inland areas
have been providing large amounts of water, fresh vegetables, meat
and eggs for Hong Kong residents.
</P>
<P>
"China then had the ability to resume the exercise of
sovereignty over Hong Kong, "Ann said, "but the newly founded
people's republic needed a stable and peaceful international
environment to heal its wounds of war and carry out socialist
construction," he said.
</P>
<P>
He added that maintaining a stable and prosperous Hon Kong
would help China break the blockade imposed by Western Countries
and expand its economy.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that handling the Hong Kong issue by peaceful
and rational means is conducive to Hong Kong's prosperity and
development, and is in the fundamental interest of the whole
nation as well.
</P>
<P>
With national invigoration as his greatest aspiration, Ann
devoted himself to expanding his own business. Along with the
growth of Hong Kong, he became one of the most prominent business
people in Hong Kong. Refusing to totally give up his dream of
becoming a linguist, Ann also rose to fame for his research into
Chinese characters.

<TEXT>
<P>
In 1970, Ann was appointed a member of the Legislative Council
of Hong Kong. Four years later, he became a member of the
Executive Council. In March 1993, 81-year-old Ann was elected a
vice-chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's
Political Consultative Conference.
</P>
<P>
All through the years, Ann has been eager to see that China
will become strong, and Hong Kong will return to the motherland
in a way that will benefit the whole nation.
</P>
<P>
Ann is all for Deng Xiaoping's "one country, two systems" idea.
"This is a concept that is both bold and ingenious."
</P>
<P>
He explains that no other country has ever allowed the
existence of two social systems within its border.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong's present systems are suited to its development and
 Maintaining Hong Kong's capitalist system is beneficial to its
prosperity and stability, he said, noting that a prosperous and
stable Hong Kong is conducive to China's future development.
</P>
<P>
Ann took an active part in making preparations for the
establishment of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region
(HKSAR). In April 1985, he became a vice chairman of the Drafting
Committee of the Basic Law of the HKSAR. He also took part in the
whole process of the drafting work that spanned four years and
eight months.
</P>
<P>
Ann has also worked for the establishment of the HKSAR in other
capacities -- Advisor on Hong Kong Affairs, vice chairman of the
Preliminary Working Committee of the Preparatory Committee for the
HKSAR, and vice chairman of the Preparatory Committee.
</P>
<P>
Looking back at the 13-year transition period for Hong Kong,
Ann said, "It has actually been the whole process for realizing
step by step the idea of 'one country, two systems'. I feel very
happy that we have eventually found the best way and time to
resume the exercise of China's sovereignty over Hong Kong."
</P>
<P>
Despite his advanced age and although he has just recovered
from an illness, Ann pledged to attend the handover ceremony from
midnight of June 30 to early morning of July 1.
</P>
<P>
"I will definitely go to attend the ceremony because I am so
happy," he said.

<HEADLINE> Draft HK Reunification Bill 1997 Published </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 18 (Xinhua) -- A draft Hong Kong Reunification
Bill 1997 was presented today to the Provisional Legislative
Council (PLC) so that the views of PLC members will be taken into
account before the Bill's formal presentation on July 1.
</P>
<P>
The draft bill was handed by the Chief Executive's office of
the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR), which will be
established on July 1 when China resumes the exercise of
sovereignty over Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Explaining the objectives of the bill, a spokesman for the
Chief Executive's office said that in accordance with the decision
made by the Preparatory Committee of the HKSAR in February 1997,
the laws that have been passed by the PLC before July 1 shall be
ratified upon the establishment of the HKSAR.
</P>
<P>
"There is no doubt about the validity of the laws passed before
July 1," he said, "but the confirmation process on July 1 would
serve as an added assurance."
</P>
<P>
The spokesman added that it would be beneficial to the public
to be given an account of all the laws passed by the PLC prior to
July 1.
</P>
<P>
The draft bill contains provisions for the endorsement of the
appointment of the Chief Justice of the Court of Final Appeal,
Justices of the Court of Final Appeal and the Chief Judge of the
High Court, which under Article 90 of the Basic Law for the HKSAR
must be endorsed by the Legislative Council.
</P>
<P>
It also deals with the adaptation of names and titles in the
laws, some with outdated references, in line with the resolution
of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress,
China's top legislature.
</P>
<P>
Another aim of the bill is to provide for various
transition-related matters, according to the spokesman, who adds
that it puts beyond doubt that the working of the government and
courts will continue after July 1.
</P>
<P>
He noted that there should be legislation establishing those
courts as well as quasi-judicial statutory tribunals and boards in
accordance with the Basic Law, and the legislation should also
provide that the laws previously applicable to such courts,
statutory tribunals and boards shall be maintained in respect of
them.
</P>
<P>
There should therefore be provision in the legislation for the
continuance of legal proceedings commenced before July 1 and for
other aspects of the administration of justice, the spokesman
added.
</P>
<P>
He said the bill also has provisions dealing with the
continuance of Hong Kong's current public servant system, and
preserves the rights and obligations of the existing government
and transfer them to the HKSAR.
</P>
<P>
The draft bill will be deliberated by the PLC at its meeting on
June 21, and views expressed will be included in the blue bill to
be gazette and presented on July 1.

</P>
<P>
TDC's Assistant Executive Director (Exhibition) C.S. Lee, said
that the conference, co-organized by the TDC and the Hong Kong
Publishing Federation, will provide a platform for members of the
publishing industry in the region to exchange ideas and to explore
co-operation opportunities.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong is the ideal venue to host the Asian Publishing
Conference, being a regional publishing hub and backed by a highly
developed printing industry which ranks the fourth in the world,
he added.
</P>
<P>
"Many major international publishers of newspapers, magazines
and books have their Asian headquarters here. The publishing
industry benefits from Hong Kong's excellent communications
network," he noted.
</P>
<P>
According to the director of Hong Kong Publishing Federation,
Chan Man-hung, Chinese publishing is an important topic to be
covered in the conference.
</P>
<P>
He said: "It has already been recognized by international
publishers that Chinese publishing is the biggest market to be
developed in the next decade."
</P>
<P>
"Hong Kong, with its experience and expertise in dealing with
both the English and Chinese languages, plays an important role in
bridging the Chinese publishing with international publishers," he
added.
</P>
<P>
More than 400 exhibitors are expected to participate the first
book fair after Hong Kong's return to the motherland, organized by
TDC and supported by 11 local publishing associations.
</P>
<P>
Last year, 300,000 people visited the book fair. With the event
expanding to the HKCEC Extension this year, a higher attendance is
expected this year.

CHONGQING, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Li Peng has
urged local officials and the citizens of China's newest
municipality to make concerted efforts to build a prosperous city.
</P>
<P>
During an inspection tour from June 15 to 18, Li visited
several major enterprises in Chongqing, which was named a
municipality directly under the central government at the Fifth
Session of the National People's Congress held in March.
</P>
<P>
Li said Chongqing faces difficult challenges: successfully
resettling the local people in the Three Gorges reservoir area,
and keeping the economy of the city in step with its overall
development.
</P>
<P>
Since the establishment of Chongqing, a number of officials
have been sent there from other parts of the country to work. Li
called on both new and existing officials to unite in their
efforts, and be conscientious in their duties.
</P>
<P>
As an old industrial base, Chongqing has been playing a key
role in promoting the development of the national economy. The
current problems in Chongqing can be solved by means of reform and
economic restructuring, Li said.
</P>
<P>
He said that Chongqing can develop its chemical industry by
relying on its advantage in natural gas resources. As for the old
enterprises, technological upgrading should be carried out in line
with the market economy, he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, June 18 (Xinhua) -- The Arab Parliamentary Union has
denounced the recent resolution adopted by the U.S. House of
Representatives saying that Jerusalem is the unified capital of
Israel.
</P>
<P>
The Damascus-seated Union, in a statement released last night,
described the resolution as flagrant provocation and great
humiliation to hundreds of millions of Muslims and Christians the
world over, and as open violation of UN resolutions on the holy
city.
</P>
<P>
It considered the resolution as anticipating the results of the
final status talks between the Palestinian National Authority and
Israel.
</P>
<P>
The statement pointed out that resolution plunges the region
into violence, or rather explosion. Besides, it encourages Israel
to maintain with its aggressive designs against the Arab people,
and to proceed with its settlement policies in the occupied Arab
territories, particularly Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The Union called upon the US Administration to abstain from
accepting this unfair and partial resolution. It also called
upon all Arab governments to unify their policies and to take a
collective stance in responding to the that resolution, with a
view to preserving the Arab nature of Jerusalem and implementation
of the related international resolutions.

<HEADLINE> Veterans Gather To Mark Anti-Japanese War </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 18 (Xinhua) -- More than 100 Chinese generals and
veterans gathered here today to mark the 60th anniversary of the
July 7th Incident -- the beginning of Japan's War of Aggression
against China.
</P>
<P>
Also attending the get-together were family members of late
veterans who fought in the resistance war, as well as other people
from all walks of life.
</P>
<P>
On July 7, 1937, the Japanese army fired on the Chinese army
near Lugouqiao Bridge, or "Marco Polo Bridge" west of Beiping,
which is now Beijing, in their attempt to annex the whole of
China. The event marked the start of the Chinese people's
eight-year national war of resistance against Japan.
</P>
<P>
Today, generals and soldiers alike told war stories, denounced
the criminal activities of Japanese invaders and lamented the
suffering endured by the Chinese people.
</P>
<P>
Many of the participants said they hope the people of China
will remember this period of history, and learn from it that a
weak and backward country is vulnerable to a stronger power. They
also agreed that the spirit of patriotism shown by the Chinese in
the anti-Japanese war should be passed on from generation to
generation.
</P>
<P>
After the meeting, a photo exhibition titled "Atrocities of the
Japanese Invaders in China" opened, featuring more than 300
historical photos illustrating the murders, rapes and other
criminal acts committed by the Japanese army from 1937 to
1945.

<HEADLINE> Kenya Doubles Efforts to Step Up War Against AIDS </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, June 18 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan government is expected
to establish a national Aids council (NAC) to formulate policies,
set up institutional framework and offer guidance for the control
of Aids.
</P>
<P>
A sessional paper tabled in parliament by Kenya's Health
Ministry said Wednesday that the government was supposed to try
its best to prevent a further spread of the disease.
</P>
<P>
According to the paper, about 200,000 people in Kenya died of
AIDS between 1984 and 1995, and some one million Kenyans would
die of AIDS by the turn of the century if no proper preventive
measures are taken.
</P>
<P>
The paper called for the recognition of AIDS as a national
disaster since data show that the number of people infected
with the disease has increased from less than 100 in 1984 to 1.3
million at the end of 1996.
</P>
<P>
At present, the paper pointed out, people with AIDS occupy 40
to 70 percent of hospital beds in the main cities of the country
which has a population of 28 million.
</P>
<P>
The research document called for an immediate change of the
sexual behavior among Kenyans to combat the escalating disease.
</P>
<P>
The paper proposed that the government should work together
with the United Nations High Commission for Refugees to mount
preventive education programs and provide health care and social
support to affected individuals.
</P>
<P>
The government is also expected to offer free medical
treatment and education to orphans and children infected with
HIV.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Vice Premier Writes Foreword for Photo Album on HK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
Hong Kong, June 18 (Xinhua) -- "Looking back on the past and
forward to the future, we may predict with perfect confidence
that, relying on the prosperous development of the motherland and
the industry and ingenuity of the six million local compatriots,
Hong Kong is bound to have an even more splendid future in the
21th century," Chinese Vice Premier Qian Qichen said in a foreword
he has written for a photo album on Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
The album, entitled "Hong Kong," contains more than 600
photographs depicting the past and present of Hong Kong. It was
co-compiled by Xinhua News Agency and Hong Kong-based Sino United
Publishing (Holdings) Ltd. and published today here in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
"Soon the bell will ring the return of Hong Kong to mark a great
moment at the turn of the century. The compilation and publication
of this album of photographs to celebrate the success of the
Chinese nation in wiping out a century-old humiliation and to wish
Hong Kong a brighter future is an event of great significance,"
the vice premier who is also Chinese foreign minister says in the
foreword.
</P>
<P>
Qian recalls the humiliation China suffered when British troops
occupied Hong Kong, the Chinese government's efforts to solve the
Hong Kong question, and the transitional period prior to the
handover of Hong Kong back to China.
</P>
<P>
A hundred and fifty-six years ago, Britain started the Opium War
against China and forced the defeated Qing government to cede Hong
Kong Island to it, thus initiating the drive of Western Powers to
carve up Chinese territory.
</P>
<P>
Later, Britain seized the southern part of the Kowloon peninsula
and compelled China to lease to it large tracts of land in the
northern part of that peninsula up to the Shenzhen River,
including more than 200 islands, calling the area "New
Territories."
</P>
<P>
"In the one and a half centuries since then, the Chinese people
have never forgotten this historical humiliation. It has become a
sacred mission of the Chinese nation to reunify the motherland,
including the recovery of Hong Kong, a mission they have vowed to
fulfill," the Foreword says.
</P>
<P>
After the founding of the People's Republic of China, the
Chinese government declared that Hong kong is part of the
territory of China, that it does not recognize the three unequal
treaties imposed by Britain on the country, and that it stands for
a peaceful settlement of this question left over from the past
through negotiations at an appropriate time.
</P>
<P>
At the end of the 1970s, China entered a new period
characterized by an emphasis on economic development and the
implementation of policies of reform and opening to the outside
world. Benefiting from the opening of the vast inland, Hong Kong's
economy kept growing rapidly with added vitality. By that time,
the idea of "one country, two systems" conceived by Comrade Deng
Xiaoping as a principle for the reunification of the motherland
had already taken shape, and the time was finally ripe for a
settlement of the question of Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Negotiations on Hong Kong between the Chinese and British
governments began in September 1982 and continued for more than
two years. On December 19, 1984, the two governments signed the
Joint Declaration of the Government of the United Kingdom of Great
Britain and Northern Ireland and the Government of the People's
Republic of China on the Question of Hong Kong, which affirms that
the Chinese government will resume the exercise of sovereignty
over Hong Kong with effect from July 1 1997 and that the British
government will restore Hong Kong to China on the same day. This
marked the inception of the transitional period preceding the
return of Hong Kong to the embrace of the motherland.
</P>
<P>
The Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region was
adopted in April 1990 as the fundamental law governing the future
special administrative region. It has embodied the "one country,
two systems" concept and spelt out the policies of the Chinese
government regarding Hong Kong in the form of law. It stipulates
that, in accordance with the "one country, two systems" concept,
the previous capitalist system and way of life of Hong Kong will
remain unchanged for 50 years, that the laws currently in force in
Hong Kong will remain basically unchanged, that the government of
the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region will be composed of
local inhabitants, and that the region will enjoy a high degree of
autonomy.
</P>
<P>
In the transitional period, which has continued for close to 13
years, there has been friendly cooperation as well as twists and
turns that tend to impede a smooth transition. But the return of
Hong Kong accords with the feelings of the people and the general
course of events; the trend of history is irreversible. Thanks to
the concerted endeavors of the people of all circles in Hong Kong
who cherish both the motherland and the place where they live,
Hong Kong has been able to preserve its prosperity and stability
and the people there have continued to live and work in peace and
contentment.

</P>
<P>
In a written statement released to Xinhua, Cam noted that
China's resumption of the exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong

</P>
<P>
Cam said that Hong Kong has long been one of Vietnam's major

even faster in recent years.
</P>
<P>
By the end of May this year, Hong Kong had been the third
largest investor in Vietnam, with a total contracted investment of
3.5 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>

its economic and trade ties with Hong Kong will develop further
after China resumes the exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong on
July 1.

<HEADLINE> Manila, Muslim Rebels End Low-level Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 18 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government and the
secessionist Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) today ended
their fifth round of low-level talks in the southern city of
Cotabato with no major issues resolved.
</P>
<P>
But both sides agreed to meet again on June 28 and 29 to
discuss a government proposal for a general cessation of
hostilities, which would cover the entire island of Mindanao,
according to reports reaching here.
</P>
<P>
The issue of repositioning the troops in Buldon Town, the
southern province of Maguindanao, had been temporarily set aside
when the two-day meeting ended.
</P>
<P>
Ghadzali Jaafar, MILF vice-chairman for political affairs,
views the new twist in the negotiation "positively" as a broader
cease-fire could be achieved soon.
</P>
<P>
He said that with the advent of a new proposal, the existing
regional cease-fire in Buldon should continue to be in effect as
this is an official agreement signed earlier by both parties to
prevent future clashes and bloodshed.
</P>
<P>
Jaafar said a government panel had already submitted to MILF
negotiators the proposal on the general cessation issue.
</P>
<P>
The MILF, on the other hand, is set to study its contents to
come up with a counter proposal that would be presented during
their next meeting.
</P>
<P>
But both sides failed to comment on Tuesday's battles between
them, which left 15 MILF rebels and two soldiers dead as the
government troops successfully rescued 43 hostages held by the
rebels Monday.
</P>
<P>
The MILF is a breakaway faction of the former rebel group --
the Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF), which already signed a
peace deal with the government last September. But the MILF was
not included in the peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
The MILF and the smaller Muslim extremist Abu Sayyaf are the
two remaining Muslim rebel groups still fighting the government.
The military estimates the MILF has a membership of nearly 12,000.

<TEXT>
<P>

to the formation of the HKSAR since it was founded 16 months ago.
</P>
<P>
The Preparatory Committee is an organ set up on the
authorization of the National People's Congress. Its main task is
to establish the first government of the HKSAR and its legislature
in accordance with stipulations provided by the Basic Law.
</P>
<P>
Over the past year and more, the committee adhered to the
principle of "Catering to the Hong Kong People and relying on
them", aroused the enthusiasm among Hong Kong people for
participating in the formation of the HKSAR and brought about a
good situation of greeting the return of Hong Kong to the
motherland.
</P>
<P>
Thus far, the committee has held nine plenums, completing the
following seven tasks:
</P>
<P>
-- forming a Selection Committee which is composed of 400
members who are all permanent Hong Kong residents;
</P>
<P>
-- electing the first chief executive of the HKSAR;
</P>
<P>
-- forming through election a 60-member Provisional Legislative
Council;
</P>
<P>

those existing Hong Kong laws to be not changed basically;
</P>
<P>
-- studying and raising suggestions on a series of major
economic issues such as the composition of the 1997-98 fiscal
budget, issues on monetary stability, handover of government
assets and construction of large infrastructure projects;

<P>
-- pushing ahead with the formation of the Committee for
Activities to Mark Hong Kong's Return to the Motherland by Various
Sectors in Hong Kong and preparing for various non-governmental
activities and
</P>
<P>
-- formulating specific methods on the formation of the first
Legislative Council of the HKSAR.
</P>
<P>
It is a major task for the Preparatory Committee to form a
400-member Selection Committee. It shoulders the tasks of
selecting the first chief executive of the HKSAR and electing the
provisional legislative council members. The Preparatory Committee
has made unremitting efforts in this regard.
</P>
<P>
In April last year, 16 meetings were held in Hong Kong by the
Preparatory Committee, soliciting opinions among Hong Kong
residents. Over 1,000 people from 366 sectors and organizations
took an active part in the meetings. As a result about a
10,000-character report on the opinions solicited from local
residents was made public

subordinate legislation and drew up a proposal on handling the
laws in force in Hong Kong.
</P>

<HEADLINE> 3.6 Billion Dollars to Be Spent on Revitalizing State Businesses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAIKOU, June 18 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese government has
allocated 30 billion yuan (over 3.6 billion US dollars) to write
off bad loans of merged or bankrupted enterprises.
</P>
<P>
During a recent inspection tour of south China's Guangxi Zhuang
Autonomous Region and Hainan Province, Vice-premier Wu Bangguo
emphasized the importance of using the money wisely to get
enterprises back in the black and help laid-off employees find
work.
</P>
<P>
Wu, who is also a member of the Political Bureau of the Central
Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC), visited the area
from June 12 to 18.
</P>
<P>
He said that state-owned enterprises still play a leading role
in China's national economy, and that they have been noticeably
revitalized by the state's newly-instituted reforms. Nevertheless,
they still are not making satisfactory profits, he said.
</P>
<P>
He encouraged local officials to help these enterprises earn
more than they did last year.
</P>
<P>
The vice-premier said that firms now face better market
conditions than ever before, especially in regard to consumer
goods, investment and exports. And bank loans have been
re-structured to better meet the needs of the state-owned
enterprises, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Wu called on state-owned enterprises to make the most of this
opportunity and increase their economic returns. Big
profit-earners should be granted more preferential policies and
given more space to develop, he said.
</P>
<P>
On the issue of laid-off workers, Wu said that local
governments must see to it that the unemployed can make ends meet
and also encourage them to look for jobs.

BEIJING, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Li Ruihuan, Chairman of the
National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative
Conference(CPPCC) met with Kandy Nehova, Chairman of National
Council of Namibia, and his party here today.
</P>
<P>
Li said that the Chinese and Namibian people have enjoyed
traditional friendship, and there have been frequent exchanges of
visits between senior leaders of the two countries since the two
forged diplomatic relations.
</P>
<P>
And economic cooperation between the two sides has been
fruitful, he added.
</P>
<P>
The successful exchange of visits between Chinese President
Jiang Zemin and his Namibian counterpart Sam Nujoma last year have
promoted the bilateral relations, Li said, adding that China
appreciates the Namibian government's "One China" position and its
valuable support to China regarding some major international
issues.
</P>
<P>
On China's domestic situation, Li noted that since new China
was born in 1949, it has scored brilliant achievements, even
though it traveled a tortuous road for a period of time.
</P>
<P>
Both the positive and negative experiences show that the major
task after assuming a position of power is to unite the nation,
stabilize society, develop the economy and improve the people's
living standard, Li said.
</P>
<P>
Nehova said that the Namibian people had established friendly
cooperative ties with the Chinese before its independence, and
this friendship has developed continuously thanks to the joint
efforts of the leaders of the two countries.

On behalf of the Namibian government and people, Nehova thanked
China's support to Namibia in all aspects.

<HEADLINE> Iraq to Resume Oil Export </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi Oil Minister Amir Mohammed
Rasheed announced here today that his country is to resume oil
exports under the renewed "oil-for-food" deal.
</P>
<P>
Rasheed made this announcement while commenting on earlier
reports that Iraq suspended its limited oil exports to the world
market.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi News Agency (INA) quoted Rasheed as saying that Iraq will
resume its limited oil exports as soon as a new distribution plan
on the oil revenues is reached by Iraq and the U.N..
</P>
<P>
He said that his ministry is continuing meetings to strike
deals with representatives of oil imports firms.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, the U.N. Security Council extended the
"oil-for-food" deal for another six months. But before the
resumption of its oil exports, Iraq must submit a distribution
plan on the oil revenues to the U.N. Sanctions Committee on
Iraq for approval.
</P>
<P>
The first six-months period of the deal expired on June 7,
while the second came into force as of June 8.
</P>
<P>
Under the deal, Iraq is again allowed to sell 2 billion U.S.
dollars of oil over six months on a renewable basis to
raise cash for the purchase of humanitarian goods urgently
needed in the country.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has been hit severely by the U.N.-imposed sanctions as
a result of its 1990 invasion of Kuwait.

<HEADLINE> Experts Expect Euro to Start Punctually </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, June 18 (Xinhua) -- International financial experts
reacted to the two-day European Union summit in Amsterdam with a
widely-shared perception that the planned single European currency
"Euro" will come into life punctually on January 1, 1999, but will
be weaker than the German mark.
</P>
<P>
"The results of the Amsterdam summit confirmed our views that
there is no big risk of a delay in the European monetary union at
the moment," analysts with the ABN Amro Bank in Frankfurt were
quoted Wednesday by the German daily General Anzeiger as saying.
</P>
<P>
"All factors point to a European monetary union with a wide
participation but a weak Euro," Ron Leven, a JP Morgan currency
expert, told the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
EU leaders in their meeting in Amsterdam have agreed to a
compromise budget stability plan that would keep the single
currency on track while accommodating French concerns about the
need for more efforts to create jobs.
</P>
<P>
But the compromise also made clear that Germany and France, the
two nations at the heart of the monetary union, had fundamental
differences in monetary and fiscal policy after the Euro is
introduced, experts said.
</P>
<P>
They also noted that although Euro was expected to be able to
compete with the U.S. dollar in the long run, the open rifts
between major European nations would benefit the dollar at least
temporarily.
</P>
<P>
"Although the huge trade deficits in the United States speak to
the disadvantage of the dollar, the political development in
Europe meanwhile will bolster the currency emotionally," Ulrich
Ramm, chief economist of the German Commerzbank said.
</P>
<P>
A survey carried by the General Anzeiger also found out that a
majority of the German population remain mistrustful of Euro which
is expected to replace their rock-hard mark eventually.
</P>
<P>
The survey showed that over 60 percent of the 1,500 respondents
were worrying about higher inflation after the introduction of
Euro, which means losses in the value of their bank deposits.

"The British are doing the withdrawal on June 30 and we do the
welcome on July 1," Jill Howard, who owns the company with her
husband, Syd, said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
However, she refused to disclose the value of the contract,
saying this is forbidden under the contract with Better Hong Kong
Foundation, a group of 15 leading Hong Kong businesses organizing
the handover show.
</P>
<P>
"But in terms of what we've done before, it's the biggest in
terms of budget and size," she said.
</P>
<P>
Her husband and an Australian crew of 15 pyrotechnicians are
leaving for Hong Kong tomorrow along with 20 tons of fireworks and
80 tons of equipment to blast them into the night sky.
</P>
<P>
Asked if she found it a little strange that Australians are
selling fireworks to the Chinese, she said: "While the Chinese
have great expertise in fireworks, they haven't much practical
experience of large-scale international events."
</P>
<P>
Syd Howard Fireworks was involved in the 1996 Atlanta Olympic
Games opening and closing ceremonies, the 1988 Australian
bicentennial of European settlement, Australia Day celebration in
Sydney each January 26 and New Year's Eve celebration on the
harbor.
</P>
<P>
The last two shows employ tall buildings as launching pads for
fireworks, something that would have been ideal in Hong Kong with
its forest of concrete.
</P>
<P>
Jill, however, will be watching the handover of Hong Kong to
China from her Sydney suburban lounge room.
</P>
<P>
"It's an exciting thing but I'll be watching it on TV like
everyone else," she said.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu Meets With EU Envoy on Syrian Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister
Binyamin Netanyahu asked today European Union (EU) peace
envoy Miguel Moratinos to convey a message to Syria for resuming
the Israeli-Syrian peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu made the requirement during his meeting here with
Moratinos who is trying to break the deadlock in the
Israeli-Syrian peace negotiations that have stalled for over one
year.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that Netanyahu's message to Syria is that
Israel hopes to resume the peace talks with Damascus without any
preconditions.
</P>
<P>
Moratinos is to travel to Damascus later today to hold
meetings with Syrian leaders on exploring ways to resume the
peace talks with Tel Aviv.
</P>
<P>
During his last mission to mediate between Israel and Syria
early May, the EU envoy conveyed a "message of peace" from
Damascus to Tel Aviv. He refuted the Israeli press reports that
Syria was not interested in making peace with Israel and was
preparing for war.
</P>
<P>
On May 4, Moratinos discussed with Israeli Foreign Minister
David Levy a proposal to reactivate the peace talks on the basis
of the Madrid Conference, which imposes no preconditions on
either side.
</P>
<P>
The outstanding obstacle blocking the resumption of the talks
is Israel's refusal to make a promise on a full withdrawal from
the Golan Heights Israel has occupied. Under the previous Israeli
Labor government, Israel and Syria appeared on the verge of a
Golan-for-peace deal, but it was never finalized.
</P>
<P>
And the peace talks have been totally frozen since the
Netanyahu-led hardline Likud government came to power last
June. Despite his repeated calls for the resumption of the peace
negotiations, Netanyahu insists that the talks should be held
without any preconditions.
</P>
<P>
The continued deadlock on the peace track has led to rising
tension between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Recently, Israeli Army Chief of Staff Amnon Lipkin Shahak
warned that Syria might resort to war with Israel if the peace
stalemate continued.
</P>
<P>
But Netanyahu said early this week that he currently saw no
immediate sign of war with Syria, though, he added, the Israeli
troops have been keeping vigilance against any possibility.

<P>
GUIYANG, June 18 (Xinhua) -- More than 70 percent of the
disabled in China are employed, according to the China Disabled
Persons Federation.
</P>
<P>
To help employ disabled persons, China reduces taxation of
factories in which disabled employees are the majority and
provides low-interest loans to them. The country's favorable
policies to the factories have increased the number of these
enterprises to more than 60,000, which earn over 500 million US
dollars in export every year.
</P>
<P>
The country has some 1,200 agencies providing technical
training and job information to the disabled, and more than 5,000
people are devoted to this work in China.
</P>
<P>
The country's 23 province-level areas has stipulated that the
rate of disabled employees in each firm should reach from 1.5 to
two percent.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that in urban areas, 83 percent of the disabled
have jobs. More than 900,000 disabled people are working in
private factories or have become private businessmen themselves.

<HEADLINE> Improved Environment in Tibet Attracting Rare Birds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, June 18 (Xinhua) -- A number of black necked cranes
returned this year to their home in Shigatse beside the Yarlung
Zangbo River in Tibet.
</P>
<P>
Wetlands along the Yarlung Zangbo used to be an important
winter habitat for the cranes, but because of the expansion of
desertified land in some areas, the cranes began to return less
and less.
</P>
<P>
The Black-necked crane mainly exists in China and is under top
state protection. The number that appeared in Gyamtang this year
was much larger than in previous years, locals say. Experts
attribute this to afforestation efforts of the past three years.
</P>
<P>
A shelterbelt has been planted since 1994, greatly hold back
desertification. The Chinese Academy of Sciences' Lanzhou
Institute of Desert Research has successfully introduced seven
sandy plants into the region, helping green up both banks of the
Yarlung Zangbo.
</P>
<P>
"The green-up drive in the region of the past three years is a
key anti-desertification effort," said a researcher from the
Institute, "and it is also an important means of protecting
wildlife there."
</P>
<P>
According to a 1994 study, Tibet is home to nearly 4,000
black-necked cranes in wintertime, accounting for 70.9 percent of
this rare bird's total population in the world.

<HEADLINE> Australian DNA Discovery Called Tool to Solve Crime </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Australian scientists said they
have discovered a new, easier way to extract DNA, an individual
genetic blueprint which is often used by police to identify
criminals.
</P>
<P>
"Touching a pen, a glass or a steering wheel is enough to leave
a telltale genetic marker more durable than a fingerprint," the
Australian Associated Press (AAP) reported today.
</P>
<P>
The discovery provides a new tool for crime investigators
because until now it has been practicable to extract DNA only from
bodily matter such as hair, blood, semen or saliva left at a crime
scene.
</P>
<P>
Through a new technique, Roland van Oorschot and Maxwell Jones
of the Victoria Forensic Science Center have now found a way to
get traces of DNA from objects that come in contact with human
skin, including condoms and gloves.
</P>
<P>
While fingerprints can smudge or be rubbed off, the researchers
found that a person can be identified from as little as 1.1
billionth of a gram of genetic material, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Experiments with people holding telephones, pens, knives, mugs,
glasses or plastic tubes for as little as five seconds produced
enough DNA to identify the user while tests on objects used by
several people showed traces from all of them.
</P>
<P>
Writing in the latest edition of the science journal Nature,
the pair said DNA traces could be passed on to a second person
picking up the object, or from hand to hand.
</P>
<P>
Van Oorschot said the technique came into its own with crime
scene evidence when fingerprints were not present or difficult to
identify, such as with gloves and condoms.
</P>
<P>
Police officers in the state of Victoria has already used the
technique successfully in attempted murder, rape, armed robbery
and drug trafficking cases, although they were yet to come to
court, AAP said.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Finds New Way to Increase Mango Yield </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Green flies are being
cultivated in Malaysia as a way to increase mango yield because
the insect is found to be an excellent pollinating agent for
mangoes.
</P>
<P>
The green flies are cultivated by leaving rotting fish at the
trunk of mango trees, after which maggots would emerge and grow
into the adult insect, Malaysian national news agency Bernama
reported today quoting a government official.
</P>
<P>
"The flies flying around from flower to flower helps to
pollinate them," Hussin Yunus, Director of the Perlis State
Agriculture Department which is undertaking the exercise, was
quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The mango trees have markedly increased flowering since the
cultivation exercise began, and hopes of a bumper harvest are
high, the official said.
</P>
<P>
The department aimed to double the yield from the present 500
mangoes per tree each season to 1,000, he said.
</P>
<P>
There are about 130,000 mango trees over a total of 1,000
hectares in the state, of which 2,548 trees belong to five state
agriculture projects covering 182 hectares while the remainder are
privately cultivated in backyards and compounds.
</P>
<P>
The flies pose no danger to residents in the vicinity,
according to the official.

<HEADLINE> China and Japan Joint TV Movies Production </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Shanghai, June 18 (xinhua) -- China may have the world's
largest TV audience, but the TV movie is still a stranger to most
of those hundreds of millions of viewers.
</P>
<P>
But not for long. Producers from the cities of Beijing and
Shanghai, from Guangdong Province, and from Hong Kong and Japan
are cooperating in producing China's first TV-movies.
</P>
<P>
Some call the TV-movie the new baby of the television
generation. It lies somewhere in between the TV series and
full-length cinemas.
</P>
<P>
But, some consider it better than both in a number of
ways. It's cheaper, at an average of 800,000 yuan each; it's
easier to shoot than a movie; and it can reach a larger audience
with that ubiquitous medium.
</P>
<P>
The difference between it and a TV series is that, although it
costs more to make, it is of higher quality in both audio and
video signal. TV-movies have a uniform length of one and half
hours. They are shot with either film or digital video tape, and
are shown exclusively on TV.
</P>
<P>
With a lineup already prepared, six movie and TV companies from
China and Japan have three action and romance pictures ready to
shoot. They will be shown in more than 80 cities in China, and
will be followed by 52 other productions.

<HEADLINE> Iran, Syria to Coordinate Stance on Turkey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Syrian Vice-President Abdul-Halim
Khaddam arrived here today to coordinate with the Iranian
government their stances toward Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Khaddam has brought with him a message from Syrian President
Hafez al-Assad to his Iranian counterpart Akbar Hashemi
Rafsanjani, the Iranian news agency IRNA reported.
</P>
<P>
Khaddam and his entourage were met by Iranian First
Vice-President Hassan Habibi at the Mehrabad Airport.
</P>
<P>
The Syrian vice-president disclosed that Turkey's alliance with
Israel, the incursion of the Turkish forces into northern Iraq
and what he called the recent Israeli instigation in the region
will top the agenda of his talks with Iranian officials, the
IRNA report said.
</P>
<P>
On the Turkish military presence in Iraq, Khaddam said that
the Turkish troops under the pretext of creating a security zone
in Iraq is an outcome of the Ankara-Tel Aviv cooperation.
He termed the Turkish troops' incursion into northern Iraq as
an open aggression and violation of the U.N. Charter.
</P>
<P>
Habibi expressed Iran's interest in exchanging views with
Syria officials on regional issues, according the IRNA.
</P>
<P>
In regard to the recent U.S. Congress resolution to recognize
Jerusalem as the undivided capital of Israel, Habibi said it is
wrong and improper.
</P>
<P>
Stressing Iran's opposition to the move, Habibi noted that
Jerusalem belongs to Muslims of the world and the Jewish state has
no right to make any claim.
</P>
<P>
Accompanied by Foreign Minister Farouq al-Shara and several
other high-ranking officials, Khaddam is on a one-day visit to
Iran.

<HEADLINE> China's Tax Revenues Up 16.6 Percent in May </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 18 (Xinhua) -- China's industrial and commercial
tax revenues for May were up 16.6 percent on a yearly basis,
according to the State Administration of Taxation (SAT).
</P>
<P>
Monthly revenues from value-added tax and consumer tax, two
major taxes under China's new tax regime of 1994, were up only 5.2
percent last month, down 7.5 percentage points from April.
</P>
<P>
The SAT attributes the substantial slowdown to a relatively
large base figure for the same month last year. The two taxes were
normal, it said.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to a skyrocketing security trading volume and increases
in duties, stamp duties on securities trading amounted to 3.67
billion yuan last month, nearly ten times what they were a year
ago.
</P>
<P>
The SAT also said that tax rebates to exporters amounted to
4.13 billion yuan in May.
</P>
<P>
Between January and May, China's industrial and commercial tax
revenues were up 17.5 percent over the same period of last year
and were 40.6 percent of this year's target.

<HEADLINE> China Seen on Right Path to Fiscal Revitalization </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 18 (Xinhua) -- The recent new tax system has put
China back on track towards fiscal revitalization, according to
financial officials and experts.
</P>
<P>
Since the adoption of a revenue-sharing tax system in 1994,
China's upward economic trends have been auspicious for the
nation's fiscal recovery, they noted in recent interviews with
Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
Official data show that China's fiscal revenue outgrew spending
for the first time in more than a dozen years in 1995, by 18.6
percent against 17.6 percent. The margin expanded to two
percentage points last year. In the first quarter of this year,
China's fiscal revenue soared 29.3 percent on a yearly basis.
</P>
<P>
The national fiscal revenue has also recovered from a downward
trend as a proportion to the Gross Domestic Product (GDP),
accounting for 10.9 percent of the GDP last year. The proportion
of the central fiscal revenue in the national total has also
stopped falling and begun on a upward movement.
</P>
<P>
All these are clear indications that China's fiscal conditions
are turning for the better and are evidence of a successful start
of fiscal revitalization, a Ministry of Finance official said.
</P>
<P>
Echoing such a view were Pieter Bottelier, chief of the World
Bank's Resident Mission in China, and Liu Shangxi, a research
fellow with the ministry's Research Institute of Fiscal Science.
</P>
<P>
Accelerated growth in the national fiscal revenue in recent
years has helped check the expansion of the fiscal deficit, which
has shrunk to a manageable level, they noted.
</P>
<P>
Although China's overall fiscal strength has been expanding
continuously since the beginning of the reform and opening-up drive
in the late 1970s, its growth has lagged behind that of the
national economy.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the fiscal revenue has been shrinking as a share in
the GDP, down from the 25.7 percent in 1980 to 10.8 percent in
1995. The same thing also happened with the central fiscal
revenue, whose proportion in the national revenue went down from
the 38.4 percent in 1985 to 22 percent in 1993.
</P>
<P>
All these problems, together with fiscal expenditure growing
faster than revenue, have caused great strains in the national
finances, Liu Shangxi pointed out.
</P>
<P>
They have adversely affected the playing of fiscal functions,
harmed the effectiveness of economic macro-control policies and
forced the Central Government to rely more on issuing treasury
bonds, he said.
</P>
<P>
To solve the problems, China has officially announced a fiscal
revitalization plan in the outline of its Ninth Five-Year Plan for
National Economic and Social Development (1996-2000) and the
Long-Range Objectives to the Year 2010.
</P>
<P>
The plan was centered around lifting the "two proportions",
namely raising the national fiscal revenue to about 20 percent of
the GDP and the central fiscal revenue to more than 60 percent of
the national figure.
</P>
<P>
For the years to 2000, the targets include making the fiscal
revenue outgrow spendings and basically eliminating fiscal deficit.
</P>
<P>
"Though the worst had passed after the introduction of
the new tax system in 1994, China has just seen the start for fiscal
revitalization as there is still a long way to go to eventually
pull the national finances out of difficulties," said Li Yang, a
research fellow with the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences.
</P>
<P>
Bottelier of the World Bank also said that fiscal strains are
an important factor affecting the sustained and long-term
development of the Chinese economy.
</P>
<P>
Fiscal difficulties are an issue that China must deal with in
earnest, he said.

<HEADLINE> Cambodian Rival Parties Trade Accusations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, June 18 (Xinhua) -- The two rival Cambodian ruling
parties today traded accusations over violence Tuesday in the
capital which left two killed and one seriously wounded.
</P>
<P>
Prince Norodom Ranariddh, first prime minister and head of the
Funcinpec party, was the target of the assault on Tuesday night,
Srey Kosal, spokesman for Ranariddh told the press at the prime
minister's official residence.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that a group of armed terrorists launched
attack on his and Ranariddh's residences under the command of
National Police Chief Hok Longdi, member of Second Prime Minister
Hun Sen's Cambodian People's Party (CPP)
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that the two sides exchanged fires with
machine-guns, mortars and rocket launchers.
</P>
<P>
However, Hok Longdi told reporters today at his home that the
violence was steered by the Funcinpec party and aimed to
assassinate Hun Sen.
</P>
<P>
Hok Longdi said that his troops did not suffer casualties
because precautious measures were taken in advance.
</P>
<P>
A curfew has been imposed in some areas in the capital and
thousands of soldiers, police and militia units loyal to Funcinpec
and the CPP were posted around the city.
</P>
<P>
Cambodia, which is scheduled to hold commune elections later
this year and national elections next year, has been disturbed by
violence for months.

<HEADLINE> 7 Killed in Renewed Clash in Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 18 (Xinhua) -- At least six Muslim rebels and one
government soldier were killed Tuesday during a renewed fierce
encounter between the two sides in western Mindanao, the southern
Philippines, the military confirmed today.
</P>
<P>
Four soldiers and scores of rebels were wounded in the clash,
the third on Tuesday between Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF)
guerrillas and government troops in the area, said an officer from
the military's South Command (Southcom) based in Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
The four-and-half-hour gun battle took place in a village in
Pikit Town, Maguindanao Province, late Tuesday morning, just
several hours after the government troops repulsed a retaliatory
attack by the rebels, Southcom Information Officer Slih Indanan
said.
</P>
<P>
The latest skirmish occurred when elements of the Army's 78th
Infantry Battalion on a security patrol in Kabasayan Village
chanced upon a group of more than 100 heavily-armed MILF men.
</P>
<P>
The troops are now tracking down the fleeing rebels, Indanan
said.
</P>
<P>
On early Tuesday morning, the battalion successfully rescued 43
oil workers captured by the MILF guerrillas, killing eight rebels.
But the rebels later staged a retaliatory attack on the troops,
killing one soldier and wounding four others.
</P>
<P>
The MILF, a splinter faction of the mainstream Moro National
Liberation Front (MNLF), is the largest anti-government group in
the country, with an estimated membership of nearly 12,000.
</P>
<P>
The MILF refused to accept a peace deal forged last year by the
MNLF and Manila and began its own peace talks with the government
early this year.
</P>
<P>
But the peace talks, which have been on-and-off due to sporadic
clashes between the two sides, have so far failed to achieve any
substantive progress.
</P>
<P>
Negotiators from the two sides are now conducting their two-day
fifth round of initial peace talks in Cotabato City, capital of
Maguindanao, which is due to end today. A general cease-fire in
the southern Philippines is a major topic for the talks.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Banks Urged to Strengthen Internal Control </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 18 (Xinhua) -- A senior central bank official
today urged Chinese financial institutions to further improve
their internal control mechanism to minimize financial risks.
</P>
<P>
Both domestic and overseas experience in recent years has shown
that an effective internal control system is the first defense
against financial risks, Chen Yuan, deputy governor of the
People's Bank of China, said at a seminar on internal control
within financial institutions.
</P>
<P>
The financial crises involving Barings, Daiwa Bank, and
Sumitomo Commercial all had something to do with the
incompleteness and ineffectiveness of an internal control
mechanism, he said.
</P>
<P>
Over the recent period of time, Chinese financial institutions
have made unremitting efforts to reinforce internal management and
improve their internal control regime, and as a result their
ability to guard against financial risks has improved, the deputy
governor said.
</P>
<P>
"However, there are still much room for Chinese financial
institutions to improve their internal control system," he said,
adding that some financial institutions have not observed
accounting rules strictly.
</P>
<P>
A lack of internal risk control will result in financial rule
violations and financial crises, Chen warned.
</P>
<P>
The fact that internal control is lax among Chinese financial
institutions has aroused great concern among the whole financial
community and caught the attention of the central government
departments, he said.
</P>
<P>
To make financial institutions improve their internal
risk-control system, the central bank has formulated a series of
measures, such as publishing rules on loans and stepping up
financial supervision, Chen told the seminar, which was attended
by more than 160 Chinese and overseas financial officials and
experts.

<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, June 18 (Xinhua) -- The Australian share market
retreated slightly today after Wall Street's second consecutive
pull-back overnight.
</P>
<P>
Interest rate-sensitive banking stocks contributed to the
market's weakness, consolidating after recent strong gains and
affected by lower bond prices amid waning sentiment for a
near-term cut in official interest rates.
</P>
<P>
The leading market indicator, the all ordinaries index, ended
8.3 points down at 2,673.4.
</P>
<P>
"Yesterday the market defied the small fall on the Dow to move
ahead and with the Dow falling again, we had to have a bit of
profit-taking coming in," Intersuisse's Andrew Sekely said.
</P>
<P>
"It was noticeable that the strongest stocks of the last few
days were the ones that have given a bit back."
</P>
<P>
In New York, the Dow Jones industrial average dropped 11.31
points to 7,760.78, after a 9.95 point fall the previous night.
</P>
<P>
Locally, the banking sector eased 38.9 points to 4,764.9, with
NAB bank losing 20 cents to 18.65 Australian dollars, ANZ bank 15
cents weaker at 9.55 Australian dollars, CBAdown 14 to 15.05
Australian dollars and Westpac off four to 7.75 Australian
dollars.
</P>
<P>
"Most of the falls were in the banks which of course have moved
ahead so strongly of recent times," Sekely said.
</P>
<P>
The wider all industrials index sank 17 points to 4,177.9, with
Boral 2.35 percent, or 10 cents, lower at 4.15 Australian dollars,
Pacific Dunlop down nine cents to 3.61 Australian dollars, and
Brambles falling 30.6 cents to 25.394 Australian dollars.
</P>
<P>
The all resources index finished 1.2 points softer at 1,517.1,
with BHP easing three to 19.27 Australian dollars, WMC 11 cents
lower at 8.44 Australian dollars and Rio Tinto 3.5 cents up at
23.23 Australian dollars.
</P>
<P>
QNI today announced it will merge with the nickel division of
South African company Gencor to form the world's fourth largest
producer of nickel.
</P>

<HEADLINE> China's EximBank to Extend More Preferential Loans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 18 (Xinhua) -- China's Export-Import Bank
(EximBank) will extend more preferential loans to help promote
cooperation between Chinese and overseas enterprises, according to
sources at a seminar held here today.
</P>
<P>
Practice over the past two years has shown that subsidized
preferential Chinese Government loans not only benefit economic
development in the recipient country, but also enable Chinese
enterprises to tap into overseas markets and compete
internationally, a bank official said.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, the EximBank will continue to expand its business in
relending subsidized preferential Chinese Government loans, which
are long-term or medium-term loans provided by the Chinese
Government to developing countries, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese Government decided to promote the use of
preferential loans as assistance to developing countries in 1995
and designated the EximBank to make the relending.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that the EximBank has agreed to relend
preferential loans to 32 projects in 24 countries in Africa, Asia,
Oceania, and Latin America. It has already signed loan agreements
for 15 projects, with the relending amount totaling 1.2 billion
yuan.
</P>
<P>
The EximBank, a policy-oriented bank founded in 1994 to finance
Chinese exports of machinery and electronics, has also signed
general agreements on loans with the governments and relending
institutions of six countries, according to the official.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Denies Involvement in S. Leone's Aborted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria said on Tuesday it did not
sponsor the coup attempt against Sierra Leone's military junta
led by Major Johnny Paul Koroma.
</P>
<P>
The denial was made on the heels of the formal swearing in of
Koroma Tuesday morning as head of state, an event which was held
despite the welter of international condemnation and potential
sanctions.
</P>
<P>
Koroma's ruling Armed Forces Revolutionary Council announced
on Monday it foiled a counter coup and arrested about 10 military
officers and politicians allegedly involved in the plot.
</P>
<P>
The military junta also claimed that Nigeria was behind the
aborted coup attempt.
</P>
<P>
But according to Godwin Ugbo, Acting Director of Defence
Information, this was only a "wild allegation" of Koroma's
military regime intended to curry favor from Western countries.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria had no other interest in Sierra Leone than the
restoration of peace and return of power to the civilian
government led by ousted president Ahmed Tejan Kabbah, the
defence spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Koroma was reported as saying at his inauguration
ceremony in the military headquarters in the capital Freetown
that the handover of power would lead to chaos in the country.
</P>
<P>
Despite Koroma's promise to establish a broad-based government
made up all parties concerned in an election in due time, his
formal inauguration was seen by observers as a defiance of the
international requirement that the ruling military return power
to the toppled civilian government.
</P>
<P>
According to Ugbo, the west African peacekeeping force, known
as ECOMOG, was still in the course of military build-up while
negotiations for a peaceful settlement of the crisis in the
war-torn country were underway.
</P>
<P>
This, observers said, can be interpreted that if the talks
fail and Koroma continues to refuse a handover of power, ECOMOG
might launch larger scale military intervention to restore
Kabbah's government.
</P>
<P>
ECOMOG shelled military targets in Freetown shortly after the
military took over power in a coup on May 25, following which
Koroma announced himself to be head of state of Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
ECOMOG troops also exchanged fire with the coupists in an
effort to hold some strategic positions and evacuate foreigners
in the city. The exchange of fire was temporarily stopped when
intensive diplomatic operations started later to seek peaceful
resolution.
</P>
<P>
Beside the threat of imminent attack by ECOMOG, the coupists
have received wide-spread international condemnation even as they
seek to consolidate on their power through shuttling diplomacy in
some African countries to enlist support.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that the delegations sent by Koroma regime to
Cote d'Ivoire and Ghana were rebuffed by these countries who
demanded the unconditional restoration of President Kabbah.
</P>
<P>
At home, civil servants defied the ruling junta's repeated
order to go back to work, continuing their peaceful strike, while
schools, shops, banks and other service facilities remained
closed.
</P>
<P>
Parliament members and religious leaders have also called on
the junta to return power to civilians.

<HEADLINE> Chinese President Meets Former US Secretary of State </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin met
here today with former US Secretary of State Henry Kissinger.
</P>
<P>
Jiang expressed his appreciation for Dr. Kissinger's efforts in
the past years for safeguarding and promoting the development of
Sino-US relations.
</P>
<P>
Noting that there are important common interests between China
and the US, Jiang recalled his meeting with US President Bill
Clinton last year in Manila, saying that during the meeting, both
sides agreed that they would seek common ground while reserving
differences and make joint efforts to establish a stable and
healthy Sino-US relationship for the next century.
</P>
<P>
Jiang continued that recently, bilateral relations have
basically maintained the upward momentum which emerged in the
latter half of last year.
</P>
<P>
To seize the opportunity to push bilateral relations to a new
high requires not only the joint efforts from the two governments,
but also the active promotion of people of insight of various
circles, said Jiang.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that Kissinger would employ his influence
and continue to play an active role in promoting the further
improvement and development of Sino-US relations.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that there are only 13 days left before China
resumes the exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong, and expressed
his confidence in Hong Kong's stable transition and smooth
handover.
</P>
<P>
To guarantee a long-term prosperity and stability in Hong Kong
is not only in the interest of China itself, but also conducive to
all the countries including the US, Jiang pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Kissinger said that US-China relationship is the most
important bilateral relationship in the current world, and that
the maintenance of a sound and stable relationship between the two
countries is not only conducive to world peace and stability, but
will also have an influence on the direction of the world in the
next century.
</P>
<P>
Kissinger told Jiang that he, as many US people, is expecting
Jiang's state visit to the US scheduled in autumn this year, and
expressed the belief that this important visit will bring
bilateral relations into a new stage.
</P>
<P>
He said he is convinced that Hong Kong will keep its prosperity
and stability after its return.
</P>
<P>
Present at the meeting were Liu Huaqiu, director of the Foreign
Affairs Office of the State Council, and Mei Zhaorong, president
of the Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs.
</P>
<P>
Kissinger and his party are here as guest of the institute.

<HEADLINE> S. Korea's Financial Reform in Dispute </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, June 18 (Xinhua) -- South Korean government's efforts to
legalize a controversial financial reform draft are feared to
escalate disputes with labor unions which vowed to use all
possible means to block its passage.
</P>
<P>
Angered at the bills designed to merge the Bank of Korea (BOK),
the Security Supervisory Board (SSB) and the Insurance Supervisory
Board (ISB) into a single supervisory body, labor unions of the
three organizations declared a joint front to stem the
government's action at a press conference on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Announcing the plan to set up the Financial Supervisory Board
(FSB) on Monday, Deputy Prime Minister and Finance and Economy
Minister Kang Kyong-Shik said the BOK will be put merely in charge
of setting monetary and credit policies but be stripped of its
regulatory authority over commercial banks.
</P>
<P>
"The bills run counter to deregulation and citizens' wishes to
get rid of government intervention in the financial sector
following the Hanbo scandal," said Kwon Young-Kil, president of
the Korean Confederation of Trade Unions.
</P>
<P>
He said his organization will fight the government attempt of
pushing the bills through.
</P>
<P>
More than one-third of the existing union members in these
bodies are expected to lose their jobs because of the new move.
</P>
<P>
The government has determined to exert all possible efforts to
have the bills passed by the National Assembly as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Finance and Economy (MOFE) said it is
meaningful that the heads of different organizations reached
agreement on revising the central banking and financial regulatory
systems, putting an end to the controversy that heated up over the
last four decades.
</P>
<P>
"It would be impossible for the parties whose interests
conflict with each other to produce a compromise satisfactory to
all," ministry officials said.
</P>
<P>
The presidential office Chongwadae also said that it will push
for the implementation of the reform plan despite strong
opposition from interest groups.
</P>
<P>
The fate of the bills remains unknown as opposition parties
joined unions' efforts to make their passage impossible.
</P>
<P>
The National Congress for New Politics (NCNP) and the United
Liberal Democrats (ULD) said the reform "should be made in the
next government," an indication that they would not allow the
current government to score a point through the program, right
before the presidential election scheduled for December.

<HEADLINE> Code of Conduct Launched in S.Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 18 (Xinhua) -- A Code of Conduct for Public
Servants has been launched in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
Launching the code of conduct in Parliament on Tuesday, South
African Public Service and Administration Minister Zola Skweyiya
called on all public servants to adopt the new code and use it to
eliminate corruption in all its forms, including theft, abuse of
state property and nepotism, local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
Skweyiya warned that no contravention would be tolerated and
action would be taken in terms of disciplinary provisions
contained in the Public Service Act.
</P>
<P>
The code which has set ethical standards for public servants,
is aimed to stamp out "the litany of incidents of corruption",
improve the work ethic, fight fraud and get public servants to be
honest and helpful, according to the reports.
</P>
<P>
Among the requirements are a provision that public servants
are expected to serve the public impartially and will not be
allowed to unfairly discriminate against any member of the public
on the grounds of race, gender, ethnic or social origin, age,
religion, political persuasion,and culture or language.

<HEADLINE> Australian Dollar Stronger As Rate Cuts Seen Delayed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, June 18 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar ended
stronger in Sydney today following buying of the unit by offshore
investors on the back of perceptions that any domestic easing in
interest rates was likely to be delayed.
</P>
<P>
Traders said the market believed the Reserve Bank of Australia
had missed an opportunity to cut rates following the release last
Thursday of weaker-than-expected employment growth figures.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar closed at 75.14 US cents, up from 74.81
US cents at the previous local session close. Yesterday's close
marked the first time in 16 months the unit had been around that
level.
</P>
<P>
"This is probably a corrective move up for the Australian
dollar and we look for possible selling between here and 75.20 US
cents to 75.30 US cents," a trader said.
</P>
<P>
The central bank was seen delaying any policy action until at
least after its July 1 policy meeting. It last cut rates on May
23, lowering the cash rate to 5.5 percent from 6.0 percent.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar was at 85.35 Japanese yen, up from 84.78
yen previously.
</P>
<P>
It also was at 1.2967 German marks, up from 1.2962.

Its Chairman, former Head of State Muhammudu Buhari said PTF
has received 70 billion Naira (about 824 million dollars) in the

STOCKHOLM, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Sweden has failed to achieve the
target of lowering nitrogen emissions by 50 percent between 1985
and 1995, a government report said.
</P>
<P>
"This target has not been achieved. The emissions have declined
by 20 percent so far," the report by the National Environment
Protection Board (NEPB) said.
</P>
<P>
Pollution caused by nitrogen emissions in inland water and
densely populated areas have affected the coastal areas much more
than was previously thought, the report.
</P>
<P>
The most affected areas are the Maelar region around Stockholm
and along parts of Sweden's west coast.
</P>
<P>
The board has proposed vigorous efforts in fullfuling Sweden's
commitments in environment protection.
</P>
<P>

Tuesday. Among the 5,600 jobs to be reduced as was planned by the
1997 budget law, 5,000 would be from the sector of national
education and should be implemented from September.
</P>
<P>
-- Since the establishment of a leftist government that was
joined by the Greens, several great projects of public
infrastructures have been frozen in France. Experts accused the
Minister of Environment and Territory Management Dominique Voynet,
who is head of the Greens, of adopting a totally negative attitude
toward public infrastructures, although the number of their projects
has been experiencing a free fall for several years.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong's Return Enhances Patriotic Sentiments of Chinese Servicemen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 18 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese People's Liberation
Army (PLA) and the Armed Police Force, in line with the
instruction of the Chinese Communist Party's Central Committee and
the Central Military Commission, have carried out various
educational activities centering on the return of Hong Kong to its
motherland.
</P>
<P>
Under the unified arrangement by the General Political
Department of the PLA, these activities are aimed at boosting the
national dignity, confidence, and sense of pride among the
officers and men of the army and the armed police force and
enhancing their sense of duty for making contributions to the
reunification of the motherland and revitalization of the nation.
</P>
<P>
The three general departments of the PLA, namely Headquarters
of the General Staff, the General Political Department, and the
General Logistics Department, have arranged the study on the
expositions by Deng Xiaoping on the Hong Kong issue as well as the
important speeches given by President Jiang Zemin on patriotism.
</P>
<P>
Through the study, the officers and men of the three general
departments have deepened their understanding of the great concept
of "One Country, Two Systems" and the Party Central Committee's
policies related to the Hong Kong issue.
</P>
<P>
By organizing visits to the sites of historical importance
nearby their barracks, the forces of the Guangzhou, Shenyang, and
Nanjing Military Area Commands have conducted various educational
activities for their servicemen with the objective to enhance
their patriotic sentiments.
</P>
<P>
Through book-readings and speaking contests on the "One
Country, Two Systems" concept, the PLA air force have learned the
historic contributions made by the Chinese Communist Party to the
country's independence and revitalization.
</P>
<P>
By launching a large scale signature drive, the naval force has
taught its officers and men the lesson how China had suffered over
the past century due to the lack of strong naval defense.
</P>
<P>
The University of National Defense and the Military Academy of
Sciences have held seminars on the Hong Kong issue.
</P>
<P>
Most of these activities took the study of the Basic Law and
the Law Concerning Stationing Troops to the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (the Garrison Law) and other related laws as
their main contents.
</P>
<P>
The Lanzhou and Chengdu Military Area Commands have organized
the study among the officers and men on the laws related to the
Hong Kong issue.
</P>
<P>
The Commission of Science, Technology and Industry for National
Defense and the Second Artillery Force have organized quizzes on
the Basic Law and the Garrison Law.
</P>
<P>
The Jinan Military Area Command has combined the study of the
Basic Law and the Garrison Law with that of the National Defense
Law and have further boosted the patriotic sentiments of its
officers and men.
</P>
<P>
In order to create a good social environment for the return of
Hong Kong, the Guangdong Provincial Military Command has
encouraged its officers and soldiers to carry out their duties in
a more civilized way and in accordance with the law and have
strengthened their enforcement of the law.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong Funds Flow To Hainan Island </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAIKOU, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Hainan Island in south China is
still a favorite destination for investment from Hong Kong. Every
year, millions of dollars are flowing into this island that has
become the largest special economic zone.
</P>
<P>
Funds from Hong Kong account for the biggest share of overseas
investment in the island, totalling 2.5 billion US dollars so far.
</P>
<P>
Investment from Hong Kong still flows into Hainan at a rate of
125.52 million US dollars per year.
</P>
<P>
In the first five months of this year, Hong Kong business
people opened 29 joint ventures in Hainan, with a total contract
value of 93 million US dollars.
</P>
<P>
As one of the few unpolluted land plots designated by the
United Nations, Hainan has drawn some of the largest real estate
projects from Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
The 30-square-kilometer Yangpu Development Area is an
investment coup for Kumagai Gumi (H.K.) Ltd. After pumping five
billion Hong Kong dollars into the real estate joint ventures in
China in the past four years, the developer is luring
construction projects into the area.
</P>
<P>
C. P. Yu, managing director and deputy-chairman of Kumagai
Gumi, said that the company is striving to turn an ambitious
blueprint into reality, to turn Yangpu into another Hong Kong as
late Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping had envisioned.
</P>
<P>
Hainan, the southern-most province of China, has been
attractive to overseas developers for its preferential policy on
large-scale land development projects.
</P>
<P>
The Hong Kong-Macao International Investment Company from Hong
Kong channeled 75 million US dollars into the construction of a
large-scale power plant near Haikou, capital city of the island
province. The 250,000-kilowatt power plant generates the bulk of
the electricity needed by the whole island.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong funds have fueled real estate and infrastructure
development in Hainan in the past ten years, making Hong Kong the
top investor in the island. Now funds are re-channeled to other
fields of growth, such as high technology and environment.
</P>
<P>
The Hong Kong-Macao Industrial Development Area, one of the
earliest set up by Hong Kong investors on the island, has shifted
its industrial focal point from labor-intensive manufacturing
industries to fund- and technology-intensive industries, such as
biological engineering, precision instruments, and chemicals.
</P>
<P>
New projects set up in the area include a 35-million-US-dollar
glassware factory and a 800-million-yuan (96-million-US-dollar)
polyester plant.
</P>
<P>
A tropical botanic garden is taking shape in Hainan under the
sponsorship of a Hong Kong company. The chairman of the company
said that he will build the haven of rare tropic plants into a
"project with the image of the 21st century."
</P>
<P>
As the return of Hong Kong to the motherland is approaching,
Hainan is planning to tap its human and natural resources more
fully so as to draw more funds, technology, and talents from Hong
Kong.

<HEADLINE> "China's Foreign Affairs" (1997 edition) Published </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 18 (Xinhua) -- The 1997 edition of "China's
Foreign Affairs", which elaborates China's views on the
international situation and its diplomatic activities of the
previous year, was published by the World Knowledge Publishing
House recently.
</P>
<P>
This year's edition, compiled by the Policies Research Office
of China's Foreign Ministry, records the development and change of
relations between China and all other countries, and international
organizations.
</P>
<P>
The book described the international situation in 1996 as
remaining relaxed in general, but many destablizing and uncertain
factors still existed; the relations between big countries
underwent major and profound readjustments; a global multi-polar
pattern further developed; economic elements played an increasing
role in the international relations, while elements of
geopolitics, military security, and ideology were conspicuous; the
situation in some regional hotspots fluctuated, and it was complex
and changeable; regional and global economic cooperation was
enhanced, competition was more intense, some positive changes took
place in the south-north relations.
</P>
<P>
On China's diplomatic activities in 1996, it says, China
observed its independent foreign policy for peace and took a
positive attitude toward enhancing its good-neighborly relations
of friendship with neighboring countries, noting that friendship
and cooperation between China and other developing nations were
promoted obviously, while extensively improving its relations and
enhancing mutually-beneficial cooperation with Western countries.
</P>
<P>
It also says that China engaged in last year's diplomatic work
in a comprehensive and multi-faceted manner, pointing out that
Chinese leaders visited 36 countries in five continents, and some
40 foreign state and government leaders visited China, enhancing
mutual understanding and friendly cooperation between China and
other countries.
</P>
<P>
China continued to play a positive role in multilateral
activities and major international affairs, and participated in
diplomatic activities of both the United Nations and regional
organizations in a wide range of areas, contributing to world
peace and common development, it says.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government firmly safeguarded state sovereignty,
territorial integrity, and national dignity in 1996, struggled
against any acts of interference in China's internal affairs, and
pushed ahead the cause for the reunification of the motherland,
according to the new edition.
</P>
<P>
The 700,000-plus-character edition summarizes the international
situation, China's relations with other countries and
international organizations and its activities in treaty,
legislative, and consular affairs.
</P>
<P>
The appendix to the book includes significant speeches made by
Chinese leaders on diplomatic issues and organizations of China's
Foreign Ministry.

<HEADLINE> Nine Pro-reform Rallies Called off in Kenya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Nine rallies scheduled this
Saturday for constitutional reforms in various parts of Kenya
have been postponed, local newspapers reported today.
</P>
<P>
Announcing the postponement, opposition Ford-Asili leader
Kenneth Matiba and National Development Party leader Raila Odinga
told a press conference today that the rallies would be
held at a later date.
</P>
<P>
Observers here said that the scheduled rallies were bound to
provoke a major showdown between the Kenyan government and the
Opposition as the former declared that all the rallies without
licence were illegal and the Kenyan authorities were determined
to crush illegal rallies.
</P>
<P>
Last month, the opposition coalition and some church
groups advocating for constitutional reforms held a rally in
Nairobi which was dispersed by Kenyan police, leading to running
battles in the main streets in the capital city.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, 18 foreign missions accredited to Nairobi Tuesday
urged the Kenyan government and pro-reform organizations to
engage in dialogues to avert violence.
</P>
<P>
Dialogues may facilitate a compromise rather than
confrontation between the two sides, they added.
</P>
<P>
The missions also backed the government's proposed Peaceful
Assemblies Bill to replace the contentious Public Order Act,
saying this was a major step to paving way for the coming General
Elections to be held freely, fairly and peacefully.

SEOUL, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong will continue to serve as
the financial hub of East Asia in the coming century after it
returns to China, an official of the South Korean Ministry of
Finance and Economy (MOFE) said today.
</P>
<P>
South Korean businesses in Hong Kong remain unchanged with 10
days away from the territory's return to China, and they won't be
affected by the transfer of power in the territory since China
pledges to keep the policy of "one country, two systems" to
guarantee Hong Kong's status as an international financial hub,
the official said.
</P>
<P>
Most of South Korean banks operating in Hong Kong forecast
little change in business after Hong Kong returns to China,
according to a survey conducted by the MOFE.

<HEADLINE> Future HK Government to Work for Proper Housing for All </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 18 (Xinhua) -- The future Hong Kong government
will solve the housing problem in this heavily populated city in a
"fair and open" manner.
</P>
<P>
With housing listed among the top concerns of local residents,
Dominic S. W. Wong, Secretary for Housing, said that the future
Hong Kong government will have a great deal to do to provide
proper housing for all local residents.
</P>
<P>
Wong reveals a housing construction plan for the 1995-2001
period.
</P>
<P>
According to the plan, the housing branch of the government
will build 510,000 housing units during that period, including
316,000 public housing units and 195,000 units for sale at market
prices to individuals.
</P>
<P>
Wong said the government will provide sufficient land and
proper infrastructure to encourage private real estate developers
to participate in undertaking public housing projects, and retain
the current policy on low-income families, namely, supply them
with high-quality and low-rent apartments.
</P>
<P>
He said that over the next few months the government will
formulate a long-term housing development strategy which will
take the suggestions of local residents into consideration.
</P>
<P>
The 55-year-old secretary has been a public servant for 35
years, and the Secretary for Housing for two-plus years.
</P>
<P>
According to Wong, Hong Kong started to build public housing in
the 1950s, and about 40 percent of Hong Kong residents live in
such housing units whose rents account for about nine percent of
the average income of local tenants.
</P>
<P>
He added another 10 percent of Hong Kong residents live in
housing units they have bought at discount prices, with government
subsidies.
</P>
<P>
Wong is fond of sports, including swimming and badminton, often
takes part in Cantonese Opera and singing performances, and
donates money for charities. He has two sons and one daughter, all
of whom are at school. His wife lends him a great helping hand to
him in his work and family life.

<HEADLINE> S.African Defense Minister Turns Down Proposed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 18 (Xinhua) -- South African Defense
Minister Joe Modise warned that the proposed military budget
cut could seriously disrupt the defense force's ability to
function and its ability to fight against crime.
</P>
<P>
Speaking Tuesday at the National Council of Provinces (NCOP),
Modise said he found the latest figures for defense budget cuts
alarming.
</P>
<P>
Finance Minister Trevor Manuel had reportedly informed Modise
of a further 700 million Rand (155 million U.S. dollars) cut
which would increase this financial year's cut in the defense
budget to a "staggering "1.4 billion Rand (311 million U.S.
dollars).
</P>
<P>
"I must say quite frankly that a cut of this order runs the
risk of disrupting the defense function and is creating
tremendous problems for its management," local daily the Citizen
today quoted Modise as saying.
</P>
<P>
The budget cuts, Modise said, would disrupt the military
effort to support the police in the fight against crime, limit
training programs, and result in ending the contracts of a large
number of regular force members, which would increase the number
of unemployment in the country.
</P>
<P>
The disaster-relief ability of the defense force would also
suffer, said Modise, who was engaged in discussions with the
government at the highest level in an attempt to bring home the
consequences of the military budget cuts.
</P>
<P>
Modise has received widespread support from across the
political spectrum in the NCOP.

<HEADLINE> Egyptian FM Leaves for Rome </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr
Moussa this morning left for Rome on a visit to Italy, the first
leg of a European tour that will focus on the European role in
the Mideast scene.
</P>
<P>
Before leaving, Moussa said that he will hold talks with
Italian officials on the developments of the peace process in the
Middle East.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, he will head for Paris to join the delegation
accompanying Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak on his visit to
France, he added.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak will meet with his French counterpart Jacques Chirac
in Paris Thursday to discuss the European role in the peace
process and the settlements issue.
</P>
<P>
After Paris, Moussa said, he will fly to London to discuss with
the new British Labor government Egypt's efforts exerted on the
European arena to salvage the Mideast peace march.
</P>
<P>
Europe has been seeking a stronger role in the Mideast
peacemaking and sent its special envoy to the region several
times in a bid to break the current crisis due to Israel's
construction of a new Jewish settlement in Arab East Jerusalem
three months ago.
</P>
<P>
In an indication of the futility of Egypt's recent mediation
attempts, Moussa Tuesday ruled out another imminent shuttle tour
by presidential advisor Osama el-Baz to bring closer viewpoints
of the Palestinians and Israelis.
</P>
<P>
Gap between the two sides remained despite intensive efforts
to remove obstacles to resuming the deadlocked peace talks, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Baz's several shuttle trips to Israel and the Palestinian
National Authority helped deliver the first meeting in three
months between the two sides in Cairo on June 8. But a second
round of talks was aborted due to remaining rifts.
</P>
<P>
The main obstacle to new substantive talks is the disagreement
over Israeli settlement activity, especially in Arab East
Jerusalem.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Finance Minister Resigns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Finance Minister Dan
Meridor resigned after an overnight cabinet meeting on currency
reforms.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a news conference following the seven-hour cabinet
meeting, Meridor said he handed a letter of resignation, which
goes into effect in 48 hours, to Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
Meridor said he lost confidence in Netanyahu and could no
longer serve in the government.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the cabinet, in a vote of 8-3 with 2 abstentions,
rejected the finance minister's opposition to the abolition of
foreign currency exchange controls, which has been supported by
Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
Meridor said that the abolition, which would lead eventually
to a fully convertible shekel, the Israeli currency, could lead to
a further appreciation of the shekels, and harm the country's
economy, specially the exports.
</P>
<P>
Apart from the economic issues, Tuesday night's cabinet
session was seen as the grand political showdown between Netanyahu
and Meridor, who had been accused of trying to wrest the Likud
nomination from Netanyahu before the elections a year ago.

<HEADLINE> Subterranean Hot Water in North China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, June 18 (Xinhua) -- An underground pool of hot water
with more than 220 billion cubic meters of geothermal reserves has
been found in Tianjin in north China, geologists report.
</P>
<P>
The 8,700-sq-km pool makes the city the largest of the medium-
and low-temperature geothermal resource-rich regions in China. The
reserves lie from 60 to 3,000 meters deep, and have high mineral
contents, moderate temperatures, and are suitable for daily use.
</P>
<P>
Three other geothermal pools and seven geothermal areas on the
surface have also been discovered.
</P>
<P>
In the early 1970s, a well-known Chinese geologist, Li Siguang,
said that geothermal resources in Tianjin should be used, and more
than 100 million yuan has been spent verifying the reserves since
that time.
</P>
<P>
The city has drilled 150 wells and has extracted 15 million
cubic meters of hot water annually. The three surface geothermal
pools alone provide enough water for central heating for three
million sq.m. of residences.
</P>
<P>
Another result has been that the Tanggu District was able to
shut down 581 boilers and more than 500 chimneys. More than
100,000 people use the geothermal water in their daily lives.
</P>
<P>
Tianjin has expanded the use of the geothermal heat from
industry and central heating to greenhouses, aquatic products,
therapeutic purposes, mineral water development, and scientific
research.
</P>
<P>
The city has also adopted some regulations to protect and
maintain these resources.

<HEADLINE> India May Agree to Five-Year Phase-Out of Import Curbs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, June 18 (Xinhua) -- The final phase-out period for
removal of quantitative restrictions on imports in India is likely
to be five years, a government official said here today.
</P>
<P>
India's Commerce Ministry has indicated that seven years was
the minimum period required by the country to eliminate import
curbs, yet the offer has already been rejected by both the United
States and the European Union. They have been insisting that
India should have a two-three year schedule to phase out import
curbs.
</P>
<P>
The contrasting stances adopted by India and her major trading
partners at the balance-of-payments consultations at Geneva
earlier this month resulted in the talks being suspended without
any result. The talks, which are being conducted under the
auspices of the World Trade Organization (WTO), will resume on
June 30 this year.
</P>
<P>
Government sources said that India's demand for a seven-year
phase-out period and the developed countries' insistence that this
should be reduced to two or three years are "postures."
Ultimately, the antagonists will compromise on a midway period of
five years.
</P>
<P>
Industry associations like the Confederation of Indian Industry
(CII) have suggested that import curbs should be gradually removed
over five years.
</P>
<P>
India has been reiterating that it is committed to gradually
opening up consumer goods imports, but does not perceive the need
to do so too soon.

<HEADLINE> Inter-provincial Harvesting Strong In China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, June 18 (Xinhua) -- More than 30,000 combines and
over 100,000 operators are moving about China's 19 provinces and
autonomous regions as part of inter-regional cooperation in
harvesting this summer's crops.
</P>
<P>
To make the most of China's limited number of farm machines, to
cut labor costs and save on labor, and to avoid grain losses,
ministries and government departments planned earlier this year to
organize trans-regional cooperative use of combines. This method
of harvesting was actually begun by farmers themselves in the
early 1990s, because combine owners didn't have enough land to
work locally.
</P>
<P>
Nie Hongwei, a combine operator from the Xinjiang Uygur
Autonomous Region in northwest China, is running a harvester
getting in crops in Yancheng city in central China's Henan
Province. "I will move on to other provinces and autonomous
regions after the harvest is over here, and expect to cut around
166 ha of wheat all summer," he said.
</P>
<P>
The ministries see to it that the provinces and regions share
combines according to different grain maturation dates. They have
also taken steps to provide information and fuel for this
nationwide campaign, and have freed the combines from road fees.
To save time, some of the combines are carried on trucks and
trains.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, governments and farm machinery management
departments began to look for partners elsewhere, and signed
harvest contracts. "More than 300 operators with over 80 combines
in our county rely on contracts," said Liu Zhihong, director of
the farm machinery management department of Qingyuan County in
north China's Hebei Province.
</P>
<P>
The large-scale inter-province harvesting marks a shift in
Chinese farmers' way of living and production going from
self-sufficiency to prosperity, and the beginning of
market-oriented agricultural mechanization, industry insiders
say.

<HEADLINE> Resettlement Project Brings Prosperity To Chinese Farmers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Villagers in a mountainous area
of Northeast China's Liaoning Province have found their life much
improved after they moved out the mountains.
</P>
<P>
Hu Qingji, a former villager in mountainous Liaoyang city, who
moved to another township a year ago, says, "We are living in a
multi-story building, and the whole family earned more than 20,000
yuan last year."
</P>
<P>
Hu is one of 3,500 villagers who have benefited from the
resettlement program that started in 1995 as part of the
nationwide anti-poverty campaign.
</P>
<P>
The project involves the resettlement of 200,000 people in 185
poor mountainous villages with a per-capita annual income below
400 yuan.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 80 percent of them have shaken off poverty, and the rest
of them have improved their living and production conditions, say
local government officials.
</P>
<P>
The move has not only given the poor a better life, but also
made it possible to better protect the mountain eco-system,
because villagers used to consume a large number of trees as
firewood.
</P>
<P>
Farmland and forest resources there have become better
utilized. A 533-ha farm is now under construction in the former

<HEADLINE> Rural Shanghai Citizens Applaud Pension System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, June 18 (Xinhua) -- The nuclear family may become a
rarer phenomenon in rural parts of Shanghai, as some people
gradually turn to an old-age pension system rather than continuing
to rely on their offspring, especially sons, for a living.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai is a pioneer in China's rural old-age pension system,
and already has it in all its rural areas, along with a social
security net.
</P>
<P>
According to the census, there are 1.2 million households in
rural parts of Shanghai, or 82 percent of the rural people in need
of insurance. It involves a total of 930 million yuan in premiums.
</P>
<P>
Most of the rural Shanghai residents applaud the old-age
pension system, and people are gradually getting used to the idea
of escaping the traditional notion of raising sons to secure their
lives in old age, according to a survey.
</P>
<P>
But experts say that the rapid income growth of rural Shanghai
citizens is another major factor behind the increasing number of
participants in the rural pension system.

<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGSHA, June 18 (Xinhua) -- In view of the rising divorce
rate which left more children poorly treated and educated, central
China's Hunan Province has launched a massive discussion named
"Missing Dad and Mom" to further awaken parents' sense of
responsibility for their children.
</P>
<P>
This is one of the measures taken by the Provincial Committee
on Protecting Minors to improve the environment for the healthy
growth of the young.
</P>
<P>
The committee was set up in 1990 as an arm to implement the
country's first law on protecting minors issued in 1988. Similar
committees have also been established in other parts of the
country in which various departments and people from all circles
are involved.
</P>
<P>
The Hunan Provincial Committee on Protecting Minors has in the
past seven years strived to create adequate conditions in
families, schools and the society as a whole for the good of
children.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the discussion, women's federations have opened
classes for parents, teaching them adolescent phsychology,
physiology and education, as well as explaining the law on
protecting minors.

<P>
JAKARTA, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong will continue to be
prosperous and its future will become brighter after its return to
China, Sukamdani S. Gitosardjono, president of the Association of
Indonesia-China Economic, Social and Cultural Cooperation, said
here today.
</P>
<P>
In an exclusive interview with Xinhua, Sukamdani, a leading
Indonesian businessman, said Hong Kong will remain an important
free port, an international financial center, a trade center and a
tourist center after China resumes its exercise of sovereignty
over Hong Kong on July 1.
</P>
<P>
"With the return of Hong Kong to China, China will get stronger
economically in the Asia and Pacific region," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Sukamdani, an old friend of the Chinese people, said the return
of Hong Kong to the motherland will be of great significance.
</P>
<P>
He said the "one country, two systems" principle proposed by
Deng Xiaoping is a "great concept" in seeking the best possible
solution of the Hong Kong issue.
</P>
<P>
"The concept is excellent in the framework of the peaceful
reunification of China," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said he firmly believed what the Chinese government has
promised -- the laws currently in force in Hong Kong and its
current social and economic systems will remain unchanged.
</P>
<P>
"In may opinion, there will be no change of Hong Kong's
international financial and trade positions after its return to
China, as long as its economy will continue to be based on the
open, free and market economy," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
He was also convinced that China will certainly be able to keep
the stability and prosperity in Hong Kong in the future.
</P>
<P>
On Sino-Indonesian relations after Hong Kong's return to China,
Sukamdani said the prospects for such ties, especially in economic
and trade fields, will be better and more promising than ever
before.
</P>
<P>
"Indonesia and China are two big countries in the Asia-Pacific
region who need to cooperate with each other for promoting their
international trade and further developing their national
economies for achieving welfare and prosperity for their
respective people," he said.

GUANGZHOU, June 18 (Xinhua) -- One out of every twelve people
in Guangzhou, the capital of Guangdong province in south China,
has received some form of technical training
</P>
<P>
The number of trained personnel in the city is now more than
500,000. Without technical training, people are finding it more
and more difficult to get a satisfactory job. As a result, making
better use of their spare time by turning to study is now in vogue
in Guangzhou.
</P>
<P>
One survey has shown that more than 30 percent of the city's
employees receive over 50 hours of technical training every year.
</P>

<P>
SHANGHAI, June 18 (Xinhua) -- The Shanghai General Automobile
Sales Company, which handles Santana sales, has announced a big
slash in the retail price of the Santana 2000, made by Shanghai
Volkswagen.
</P>
<P>
The price in China has been cut by as much as 16,800 yuan to
180,000 yuan.
</P>
<P>
Xiao Guopu, general manager of auto sales, says that the price
cut is due to expanded production capacity at Shanghai Volkswagen,
which is expected to produce 120,000 such cars this year.
</P>
<P>
However, experts say that the company's real purpose is to get
a bigger market share for the Santana line. In the first five
months of this year, 96,183 Santanas were sold.
</P>
<P>
The Santana will account for half of the total car sales in
China this year, according to company executives.

Chilavert scored his first goal of the Copa America as his side
drew 1-1 with Argentina on Tuesday.
</P>

The result in group A put Argentina into the quarter-finals and

Chilavert, who plays his club soccer for Argentina's Velez

Argentina equalised in the last minute when Marcelo Gallardo,
who missed a penalty in the 55th minute, made good on his second
chance.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Major Port City Being Built On Western Bank of Taiwan Straits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FUZHOU, June 18 (Xinhua) -- A major port city is expected to
take shape on the western bank of the Taiwan Straits as local
governments are pouring huge funds, estimated to exceed 200
billion yuan by 2005 for basic construction in Meizhou Bay, Fujian
Province.
</P>
<P>
By the year 2005, when construction is completed, the bay will
become a large industrial development zone with port facilities
capable of handling 100 million tons of goods annually.
</P>
<P>
According to local officials, Meizhou Bay, which stands midway
between Shanghai and Guangzhou ports, is an ideal place for
building a harbor.
</P>
<P>
The bay covers an area of 643 sq km and has a population of
790,000. The future port city will be divided into two parts for
development, with its southern part focusing on petrochemicals and
the northern part on chemical, processing and tourism industries,
the officials say.
</P>
<P>
A number of port facilities and industrial projects have been
completed or are being constructed in the area, including docks,
railways, expressways and water plants.
</P>
<P>
Now, the southern and northern parts have approved 96
overseas-funded projects involving about 13 billion yuan of
overseas investment, according to the officials.
</P>
<P>
Contracts have been signed between local governments and
overseas investors, including some international giants, on
building up a number of big projects.

<HEADLINE> Poland's Economy Grows Rapidly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WARSAW, June 17 (Xinhua) -- Poland's economy has grown rapidly
in the years since the government of the Democratic Left Alliance
was formed four years ago, Prime Minister Wlodzimierz Cimoszewicz
said today.
</P>
<P>
Cimoszewicz told a press conference that since the government
was formed in 1993, the Polish economy has been on a quick
rise. Unemployment and inflation has dropped and wages of workers
and retirement pay have been increased, he said.
</P>
<P>
More and more families are enjoying the economic recovery,
Cimoszewicz added.
</P>
<P>
The Democratic Left Alliance, consisting of nearly 30 leftist
political parties, trade unions and other mass organizations, won
the 1993 general elections and became the biggest party in
parliament. It formed the government together with the Polish
Peasant Party.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister said over the four years, the gross domestic
product has increased by 26.3 percent, the unemployment rate has
been lowered from 16.9 to 12 percent, the retirement pay increased
by 12 percent and the inflation rate dropped from 50 percent to 13
percent.
</P>
<P>
The export sector registered an annual average increase of 20
percent in the four years, he said, adding that industrial
production increased by 33.5 percent, with the production of small
and medium-sized enterprises up 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
He attributed the good economic performance to the adoption of
a new constitution, strengthened democracy and domestic
stability.

<HEADLINE> Poll Finds Little Common Ground in Racial Attitudes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 17 (Xinhua) -- Black Americans and white
Americans share little common ground in their opinions on race
relations, according to a national poll released Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"The findings reveal that race relations is one of the
foremost problems confronting the U.S.," said Eddie N. Williams,
president of the Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies,
a non-partisan think tank.
</P>
<P>
Williams said the gap in racial attitudes will prove a problem
for national leaders as they prepare to discuss the race issue on
the American agenda.
</P>
<P>
In general, whites viewed race relations in their own
communities as fairly good but saw them as poor in other parts of
the country, according to the poll of 1,702 adults.
</P>
<P>
Blacks saw race relations in their local communities as
similar to those nationally, fair or poor.
</P>
<P>
Whites are considerably more likely than blacks or Hispanics
to describe race relations in their own communities as "excellent"
or "good," said David Bositis, the joint center senior researcher
who conducted the poll.
</P>
<P>
The poll found that 50.2 percent of blacks feel there is "a
lot" of discrimination against blacks in America while just 21.1
percent of whites felt the same way.
</P>
<P>
Conducted between March and April this year, the poll surveyed
850 blacks, 850 whites and 100 Hispanics on questions of race
relations, politics and social policy. The margin of error was
plus or minus 4 percentage points.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Senate Approves Bill to Pay Dues to U.N. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 17 (Xinhua) -- The United States Senate today
voted 90-5 to pay 819 million U.S. dollars in back dues to the
United Nations, on conditions that reforms are made in the world
body.
</P>
<P>
The payment was in a 12 billion dollar package to fund and
reorganize the State Department.
</P>
<P>
Under the Senate bill, two independent agencies -- the Arms
Control and Disarmament Agency and the U.S. Information Agency --
would be merged into the State Department, and the department
would increase control over the Agency for International
Development.
</P>
<P>
Following the Senate vote, it goes to a conference committee to
work out differences in a version the House passed last week.
</P>
<P>
"It's time to end the long-festering feud between the United
Nations and Washington over our unpaid back dues," said senior
Democrat, Sen. Joseph Biden, of Delaware.
</P>
<P>
Back U.N. dues would be paid over three years. Disputes remain
over exactly what the United States owes for peacekeeping and
other operations and how much would be credited back. But both the
U.S. administration and U.N. officials have praised the compromise
legislation as a big step forward.
</P>
<P>
The Senate bill addresses U.N. arrears, requiring the U.N. to
reduce the share of U.S. dues from 25 percent to 22 percent next
year and 22 percent in fiscal 1999, and reduce the U.S. share for
peace-keeping from 30 percent to 25 percent by 1999.
</P>
<P>
It also asks the U.N. to tighten its budgets and reduce its
staff, open its programs to closer evaluation, ensure U.S. access
to U.N. financial data, and not impose taxes, create a standing
army or encroach on U.S. sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
Republican Sen. Richard Lugar, of Indiana, opposed any
conditions on the payment. He said that U.S. support for the world
body was vital to U.S. interests and the future of the United
Nations.
</P>
<P>
"It makes no sense to deny our allies funds that we owe them,
and expect that they are going to be generous in negotiating
settlements with us in a whole host of agreements around the
globe," said Lugar.

<HEADLINE> EU Leaders Reach Agreement on Watered-down Treaty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMSTERDAM, June 18 (Xinhua) -- European Union leaders reached
agreement on a new treaty early Wednesday after watering down
its key contents.
</P>
<P>
"We have reached a complete deal on the content of the treaty
of Amsterdam," Dutch Prime Minister Wim Kok, who also serves as
the rotating EU president, announced after the 15 leaders wrapped
up marathon talks shortly before 0130 GMT.
</P>
<P>
"No one can deny that we have today taken a new step towards
European unification," European Commission President Jacques
Santer told a press conference after the conclusion of the summit.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, EU heads of state and government, who started their
two-day summit here Monday, watered down many of the proposals
presented by the Dutch EU presidency, and failed to agree to key
institutional reforms to prepare the 15-nation bloc for its
eastward expansion plans.
</P>
<P>
The treaty is designed to modernize the Union as it enters into
the 21st century and prepares to embrace some dozen new members
over the next century.
</P>
<P>
But the leaders failed to reach an accord on the formula of a
new vote distribution in the EU's Council of Ministers, only
agreeing that a decision would be taken just before the
enlargement takes place.
</P>
<P>
Under the new treaty, which will be formally signed in October
in Amsterdam, EU states agree to cooperate more closely in such
areas as asylum, immigration, visa policy and crime fighting, but
the veto remains in the fields of asylum, immigration and refugee
policy because of national sensitivities.
</P>
<P>
The Schengen agreement, which lifts border checks within most
of the EU states, was incorporated into the EU, while allowing
Britain and Ireland, linked to the former through a passport
union, to retain their border checks and the right to set their
own visa, immigration and asylum policy.
</P>
<P>
Denmark's opt-out is a reiteration of a previous one,
reflecting its constitutional problems with passing sovereignty to
EU institutions. However, as a member of the Schengen group, it is
expected to remain part of the border-free zone.
</P>
<P>
On defense, Britain, Denmark and the bloc's neutrals -- Sweden,
Ireland, Finland and Austria -- were resisting calls for
integration of the Western European Union (WEU) defense club into
the bloc, seen by others as a step toward true integration.
</P>
<P>
The language in the text had been toned down, saying only that
the WEU might one day be in the EU.
</P>
<P>
The leaders agreed that the WEU would remain independent,
sub-contracted to carry out humanitarian, peacekeeping and crisis
management mission for the EU.

<HEADLINE> Cuba Works to Prevent U.S. Plots </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, June 17 (Xinhua) -- The Cuban government said today
that it will continue to send high-ranking Cuban officials to
different countries and international organizations to contain
what it described as Washington's plots against the island.
</P>
<P>
The Cuban government said that it is alerting the world, the
Latin American and Caribbean countries, in particular, of the new
dangers that were threatening Cubans and the international
community.
</P>
<P>
A document cited in today's "Granma" newspaper said the
U.S. Congress has established an alliance with the anti-Cuban
mafia in Miami and that Cuban authorities have learned of a
Washington plot to question Havana's seriousness to respect its
commitments made at previous Ibero-American summits.
</P>
<P>
Another plan is to try to tighten the Helms-Burton Act to
frighten away foreign investment from the island.
</P>
<P>
Cuba has sent representatives to the United Nations and to the
World Trade Organization to explain the new threats against Cubans.
</P>
<P>
Cuban Vice President Carlos Lage, Congressional President
Ricardo Alarcon and Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina have also
denounced Washington's schemes against Cuba on visits to various
countries.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper described the U.S. plots and campaigns against
Cuba as repugnant and said they would be "rebuffed with the
inexhaustible dignity of millions of fellow countrymen."

<HEADLINE> EU Reforms: From Maastricht to Amsterdam </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMSTERDAM, June 18 (Xinhua) -- It is just over 100 kilometers
from the small town of Maastricht in southeastern Netherlands to
the colorful Dutch capital of Amsterdam. But it has taken the
European Union nearly six years to cover this short distance in
its integration process.
</P>
<P>
After two days of tough negotiations at their mid-year summit
which began on Monday in Amsterdam, EU leaders early on Wednesday
finally reached an agreement on a new EU draft treaty, dubbed the
Amsterdam Treaty, thus concluding the 15-months long
Intergovernmental Conference designed to review the EU's
Maastricht Treaty of December 1991.
</P>
<P>
The revision of the EU treaty is aimed at modernizing the
15-nation bloc as it enters the next century and prepares to
embrace new members from eastern Europe.
</P>
<P>
Dutch Prime Minister Wim Kok, who also serves as the rotating
EU president, said after the meeting that the Amsterdam summit had
opened the way for the launching of the enlargement process.
</P>
<P>
Within the busy agenda of the two-day summit, unemployment,
which currently affects one in nine EU citizens, was given
unexpected strong emphasis.
</P>
<P>
An employment chapter was inserted into the new treaty,
providing for incentive measures to boost cooperation on
employment between member states.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, leaders lifted the clouds which had surrounded the
first day of the summit by reaching a deal on the Economic and
Monetary Union (EMU) and job creation, resolving a dispute between
France and Germany, the major engine of European integration, on
these two issues.
</P>
<P>
By ratifying the Stability Pact and an employment resolution,
the leaders gave Germany guarantees that rigid budgetary
discipline would be maintained and France received a non-binding
pledge to fight unemployment.
</P>
<P>
Though the EMU-job deal was hailed by all the EU leaders as "a
victory for everyone", the agreed draft Amsterdam treaty is deemed
by many experts as a "modest" and watered-down treaty which falls
short of the high expectations expressed at the start of the
treaty review process.
</P>
<P>
Under the new treaty, which will be signed by EU leaders in
Amsterdam this autumn, the bloc failed to take major steps towards
building a common foreign and defense policy, by only agreeing to
appoint the unknown Eurocrat, instead of a high-level figure
desired by France, to steer EU foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
On defense, EU members only agreed to "foster the institutional
cooperation" between the Western European Union (WEU) defense club
and the bloc. The eventual integration of the WEU into the EU was
blocked by Britain, Denmark and the bloc's neutrals -- Sweden,
Ireland, Finland and Austria.
</P>
<P>
The language in the Treaty was toned down, saying there was
merely a "possibility of integration" of the two organizations.
</P>
<P>
These failures could have lasting consequences in world affairs
and reinforce the United States' pre-eminence in European security
for years to come, an expert said.
</P>
<P>
The Schengen agreement, which lifts border checks within most
of the EU states, has been incorporated into the new treaty, but
allows Britain and Ireland, linked to the former through a
passport union, to retain their border checks and the right to set
their own visa, immigration and asylum policy.
</P>
<P>
The Treaty has postponed, because of unbridgeable differences
between EU's big and small states, a key decision to alter the
balance of power within the Union until the bloc is enlarged to
embrace new members from eastern Europe over the next decade.
</P>
<P>
This has undoubtly cast a serious shadow on the perspective of
the enlargement.
</P>
<P>
Having seen all these setbacks, European citizens will also be
more uncertain about what the "new Citizen's Europe" will look
like by asking the question: "what is the next stop after
Amsterdam?"

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka's Colombo Port Sets Record </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka's Colombo Port has set a
record by handling 660,927 TEUs (Twenty Foot Equivalent Units)
during the first five months of this year, a local press report
said today.
</P>
<P>
The total tonnage handled is expected to exceed 1.5 million
TEUs by the end of this year. Last year a total tonnage of one
million TEUs was handled.
</P>
<P>
Colombo port was rated 26th in the world last year as a
container handling port.
</P>
<P>
The report said the volume of cargo handled by the Sri Lanka
Ports Authority grew 20 percent in 1996 compared to an increase of
eight percent in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The number of vessels that called at the Colombo port increased
by 6 percent to 3,467 in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The report said the long term objective of the government is to
develop the Colombo port as a hub port in the region and to expand
the Galle port to ease congestion at the Colombo port.
</P>
<P>
This is expected to attract a part of the growing demand for
shipping facilities in the region, said the report, adding that
Proposals are also being studied to develop certain facilities in
the Colombo port.

<HEADLINE> EU Postpones Reforms Until Eastward Expansion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMSTERDAM, June 18 (Xinhua) -- European Union leaders agreed
Tuesday night to postpone internal reforms until the bloc's
expansion into eastern Europe.
</P>
<P>
Leaders of the 15 member countries failed to reach agreement on
the formula of a new vote distribution in the EU's Council of
Ministers.
</P>
<P>
This fundamental disagreement prevented EU leader from reaching
a compromise on two related issues: the trimming of the European
Commission (EC), the EU's executive body, and the extension of
decision-making in the Council of Ministers through a majority
instead of a unanimous vote.
</P>
<P>
The leaders agreed to limit the number of EC members to one per
state when the EU is expanded to accept more countries early next
century.
</P>
<P>
But they have yet to agree on the number of votes which will
correspond to each member state in the Council of Ministers, and
how this will be done.
</P>
<P>
The alternative being considered is a vote distribution or a
new system called "double majority", which would take into account
the population of each member state.
</P>
<P>
But EU leaders compromised to add into a new treaty a call for
the 15-nation bloc to develop closer relations with the Western
European Union (WEU), but with an eye only for the "possibility"
of an eventual merger.
</P>
<P>
Most of the bloc -- led by France and Germany -- had wanted to
bring the WEU fully into the Union in order to develop a European
defense structure alongside the North Atlantic Treaty Organization
(NATO).
</P>
<P>
But Britain -- supported for different reasons by Denmark,
Sweden, Finland, Austria and Ireland -- had argued against the
move, saying it would undermine NATO's position.
</P>
<P>
It was also decided by the leaders that the power of the
European Commission President would be reinforced upon admission
of a new country to the EU, said a spokesman of the Dutch EU
presidency.

<HEADLINE> Bounced Checks Rise in Northeastern Thailand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Bounced checks in northeastern
Thailand increased as the country is undergoing an economic
slowdown, the Bank of Thailand said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The checks unpaid amounted to 3.9 billion baht (156 million US
dollars), accounting for 37.9 percent of the total issued in the
region, the Thai central bank's northeastern regional office said.
</P>
<P>
The checks were rejected by banks as the issuers failed to meet
their obligations on a monthly base, the office said.
</P>
<P>
Bounced checks soared in the region compared with 1994 before
the country's economy began its downward trend. The problems have
promoted businesses in the region to demand more cash payment,
which has affected the business climate in general.

<HEADLINE> Glacier Lake Might Burst in Nepal: Studies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, June 18 (Xinhua) -- The Nepali government has
demanded that measures be taken to forestall the explosion of
Tsho-Rolpa glacier lake that might come this summer.
</P>
<P>
Recent studies found that the area of the glacier lake,
situated over 4,500 meter high in the Rolwaling Valley about 80
kilometers east of Kathmandu, capital of Nepal, has expanded from
1.37 sq.m. to 1.65 sq.m. and its water volume is estimated at 80
million cubic meters.
</P>
<P>
Local press reports said today that the melting process of the
lake, detected in 1996, has sped up along its north-western side.
If it bursts as expected in the summer, 40 million cubic meter of
water will gush out and affect 18 villages along the Rolwaling
river banks including the Khimti Hydro-electricity Project and the
Manthali Airstrip.
</P>
<P>
The Dolakha district administration will hold a meeting on
Thursday to decide on precautionary measures.
</P>
<P>
Experts suggested that villagers living along the river banks
be moved at least 20 meter away during the summer.
</P>
<P>
A siphon is being used as an outlet for the lake water in a bid
to avert the possible disaster, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
Experts said that even if it does not burst this summer, the
glacier lake could burst next year with even greater effect.

<HEADLINE> Armed Conflict Erupts in Phnom Penh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Two bodyguards of Cambodia's
First Prime Minister Prince Norodom Ranariddh were killed and an
AFP news agency correspondent was wounded when heavy gunfire and
an explosion shattered the city late last night.
</P>
<P>
In a phone interview earlier today, Ranariddh's security
advisor Srey Kosal told Xinhua that Ranariddh's bodyguards
returned fire when his residence was attacked from a nearby school
by gunmen.
</P>
<P>
The two sides exchanged fire with machine-guns, mortar and
rocket launchers, the advisor said.
</P>
<P>
A curfew was imposed in some areas of the capital and thousands
of soldiers, police and militia units loyal to Prince Norodom
Ranariddh's FUNCINPEC party and Second Prime Minister Hen Sun's
Cambodian People's Party (CPP) were posted around the city.
</P>
<P>
But the gunfire died down around midnight and the city became
calm.
</P>
<P>
A vehicle was destroyed by armed police in front of Xinhua's
Phnom Penh Bureau which is about five hundred meters from
Ranariddh's residence. The driver of the vehicle was wounded.
</P>
<P>
The conflict is being seen as a revenge attack by National
Police Chief Hok Lundy against Ranariddh's bodyguards, who, armed
with rocket launchers, went to Hok's house at 10.30 p.m. (local
time) for the second night in a row to intimidate his bodyguards.
Hok is a member of the CPP.
</P>
<P>
The latest violence is part of the growing political tension in
the country before general elections next year.

<HEADLINE> Interview: "My Confidence in HK Is Growing": Canadian Businessmen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 18 (Xinhua) -- "As the day for Hong Kong's
return to China is at hand, my confidence in future keeps
increasing," said Paul S.K. Lam, president of the Canadian Chamber
of Commerce in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Xinhua, Lam said, "Without living in Hong
Kong, one might not be able to share my positive feelings about
Hong Kong's future."
</P>
<P>
Lam noted Hong Kong's return to China is one of the major
historic events in this century and that it is naturally for the
worldwide news media to focus their attention on it.
</P>
<P>
But he said that he was startled at some pessimistic reports on
Hong Kong's future in his recent business trips to the West.
</P>
<P>
Lam recalled a seminar he attended in the West Palm Beach in
Florida, USA, in April this year at which he found that most of
the audience were mis-presented on what has occurred recently in
Hong Kong as well as the fate of Hong Kong after its return to
China.
</P>
<P>
"At the seminar, I used 30 minutes to brief the American
audience on Hong Kong's past and present situation, from the Opium
War in 1840 to the promulgation of the Sino-British Joint
Declaration on the Question of Hong Kong in 1984, the process of
the selecting Hong Kong's first Chief Executive and the necessity
of the formation of the Provisional Legislative Council," he said.
</P>
<P>
"I particularly cannot agree with the distorted reports on the
selection of the chief executive of the HKSAR. In my view, these
reports originated from their subjective imaginations and are
contrary to objective reality," he said, adding that they are
unfair toward the HKSAR and its government.
"The fact was that all Hong Kong governors since 1841 have been
appointed by the British government without soliciting opinions
from the people of Hong Kong, whereas the first chief executive of
the HKSAR has been selected by the selection committee that
comprises 400 Hong Kong people," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The live-telecast election of the Chief Executive enhanced my
belief in the principle of 'one Country, two Systems' and 'Hong
Kong people ruling Hong Kong'," he said.
</P>
<P>
Lam said that his experiences in the past decade, especially
over the past year, greatly increased his confidence in Hong
Kong's future development.
</P>
<P>
It is beyond any doubt that the Chinese government will keep
its promise in its commitment to Hong Kong, he said. "What the
Chinese government has done in the past 13 years has proved that
it is fully determined to abide by the Sino-British Joint
Declaration as well as the Basic Law."
</P>
<P>
Lam, director and chief executive of New World Insurance, left
Hong Kong for Canada in 1984. Having lived in Canada for four
years, he returned to Hong Kong in 1988 to take up the present
job.
</P>
<P>
He said that Hong Kong provides more opportunities in banking
and insurance businesses than Canada does, adding "the simple fact
is that Hong Kong is adjacent to the Chinese interior area where
the economy is growing very rapidly."
</P>
<P>
"But in Canada, things are different," he said, "Canada's
neighbor is the United States whose economy is highly developed
and so it is difficult for businessmen to develop there," he said.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Lam said, the future Hong Kong Special Administrative
Region (HKSAR) will continue to provide easy accesses for business
people from all over the world.
</P>
<P>
He expressed his conviction that the rule of law and free
economy will remain in operation in Hong Kong in the coming years.
</P>
<P>
"As in the past 150-plus years, Hong Kong will continue to be
managed by a corps of civil servants," he said, adding that the
general situation in Hong Kong will be still more stable.
</P>
<P>
Set up in 1976, the Hong Kong-based Canadian Chamber of
Commerce, the largest of its kind outside Canada, has 800 members
among a population of more than 150,000 Canadians engaged in
finance, insurance, accounting, information technology and
telecommunication services in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Lam said that major Canadian firms are regionally headquartered
here and they are using Hong Kong as their base to develop their
business in China's interior area.
</P>
<P>
According to a survey conducted by the chamber in April, 99
percent of the respondents said that their companies will be in
Hong Kong beyond the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
Most respondents held that China's business environment is
quite favorable and will continue to improve and 85 percent of the
respondents consider the business environment in Hong Kong over
the next two years as either good and very favorable.
</P>
<P>
"My colleagues, too, share the same positive feelings about
Hong Kong's future and for every reason I can say that my
confidence in Hong Kong has a solid base," Lam said.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Foreign Debt Hits 109 Billion US Dollars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, June 18 (Xinhua) -- The Bank Indonesia, the central
bank, has urged the private sector to be more prudent in obtaining
foreign loans as the country's total foreign debt soared to 109.3
billion US dollars in March this year.
</P>
<P>
"Both the public and private sectors must be more careful in
obtaining loans. Overseas loans should be used for productive
sectors only," Bank Indonesia governor Soedradjad Djiwandono said
here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
According to sources at the Bank Indonesia, government debt
totaled 53.3 billion dollars in the 1996/97 fiscal year while
private debt amounted to 56 billion dollars. In the 1995/96 fiscal
year, government debt was 58.6 billion dollars and private debt
was 47.8 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The decline in government debt was due to the depreciation of
the Japanese yen against the US dollar and early repayment of
foreign debt.
</P>
<P>
The central bank said increased participation of the private
sector in overall economic activity was reflected in the rise of
domestic borrowings from offshore markets.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, economic analyst Professor Anwar Nasution said that
what is important for Indonesia is "how to use the funds."
</P>
<P>
"If the loans are used for non-viable projects, this is
dangerous for the country's economic stability," he said.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, "private sector borrowing is difficult to
control." "Although the central bank has asked the private sector
to report the level of borrowings, this is difficult in practice,"
he added.

<HEADLINE> Improved Assets Evaluation Boosts Enterprise Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Emerging assets evaluation has
facilitated enterprise reform in north China's Hebei province.
</P>
<P>
Latest statistics show that local property valuers have
appraised assets worth more than 157.86 billion yuan (21.2 billion
US dollars) in book value so far, which registered an average
increase of more than 30 percent in post-evaluation value.
</P>
<P>
The deepening of the enterprise reform gave rise to a rapid
expansion of asset evaluation agencies and valuers in recent
years, said Chen Jincheng, director of the Provincial
Administration of State Property.
</P>
<P>
For now, there are a total of 74 such agencies and nearly 1,800
professional appraisers in Hebei.
</P>
<P>
According to existing Chinese laws and regulations, state
assets must be appraised for economic activities such as setting
up Sino-overseas joint ventures, asset auctions and transfers,
enterprise mergers, bankruptcies and alliances.

<HEADLINE> Clear Water Project Unfolds in Jiangsu </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Young volunteers in East China's
Jiangsu Province have recently taken part in a program to protect
local drinking water sources that have been badly polluted.
</P>
<P>
The province used to be famous for its clear rivers and
lakes. Yet, the drinking water sources have been getting
increasingly polluted due to negligence of environmental
protection during its rush for economic development.
</P>
<P>
To ease the shortage of drinking water and enhance the
awareness of environmental protection, the provincial Communist
Youth League (CYL) committee and the provincial Environment
Protection Bureau have devised a series of activities for
protecting drinking water sources.
</P>
<P>
More than one million young people added their names to a piece
of cloth bearing the characters "Creating a Green Environment for
Future Generations", as a show of support. And youngsters in
Nanjing, the capital of Jiangsu, distributed leaflets to arouse
the people's awareness of environmental protection.
</P>
<P>
Lianyungang, one of the province's ports, organized students to
pick up waste from streets, rivers and harbors.
</P>
<P>
"Students have been asked not to throw things into rivers,
lakes, and reservoirs," said a head of the Jiangsu Provincial
Young Volunteers' Association. And young people are being asked to
form groups on weekends or holidays to provide information on
environmental protection in factories, enterprises and
villages.

<HEADLINE> Latvian Premier Denounces Corruption </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, June 17 (Xinhua) -- Latvian premier Andris Skele made a
televised speech on Tuesday evening, saying he was gravely
concerned about the country's political situation in the face of
rising corruption among officials and politicians.
</P>
<P>
He lashed out at several political parties, accusing them of
becoming "clubs and cliques whose highest ideal is to help party
members seek profits and shield them."
</P>
<P>
His speech comes a day after the resignation of Minister of
Culture Rihards Piks who was found to have broken the anti-graft
laws.
</P>
<P>
Reports from the Latvian capital Riga said that "a major
political scandal" has been exposed in the country, with 12
government officials and 46 members of parliament having taken up
posts in non-state agencies, violating anti-corruption laws.
</P>
<P>
The scandal indicates that "a new privileged stratum consisted
of special figures" has taken shape in the country, Skele said,
adding that these groups of people have put themselves above the
law.
</P>
<P>
Skele, an entrepreneur without any party affiliation, has been
Latvian Prime Minister since December 1995, following the
country's second general election after independence in 1991. He
heads a coalition government made up of several parties.
</P>
<P>
Last month, Skele sacked his Defense Minister Andrejs Krastins,
accusing him of making fuel deals for the army which violated
state procurement rules.
</P>
<P>
At the time, Skele said fighting corruption had to become one
of the main jobs of the state, and warned that all people
responsible for the use of state funds would be scrutinized very
closely.

<HEADLINE> Great Wall Bricks Bearing "Signature" of Makers Discovered </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Chinese archaeologists have
discovered nearly one million pieces of bricks engraved with the
time and the names of manufacturers and builders in one section of
the Great Wall in Hebei Province.
</P>
<P>
The engraved bricks appear mostly in a 500-meter section of the
Great Wall at Jinshanling built during the Ming Dynasty
(1368-1644) 400 years ago.
</P>
<P>
Each brick tells when, where and by whom it was made, such
as one that bears the characters "Made and built by Shandong Left
Battalion in 1576."
</P>
<P>
The Jinshanling Great Wall, more than 10 kilometers in length,
has five passes, 67 watch towers and two beacon towers.
</P>
<P>
Experts in Great Wall Studies say that the bricks are of
special value to researchers concerned with the history of the
defense's construction.
</P>
<P>
Until recently, only a small quantity of bricks bearing
characters had been discovered on the Jinshanling section of Great

<HEADLINE> ROK Consul General is Confident in Hong Kong's Future </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONGKONG, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Yang Chun Park, consul general of
the Republic of Korea (ROK) to Hong Kong, said he is optimistic
about and confident in the future of Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong is to return to the embrace of China after 156 years
of British rule, he said, "As a friendly neighboring country, ROK
would like to express its sincere congratulations to China on Hong
Kong's return."
</P>
<P>
The Chinese Government has indicated to the whole world that
Hong Kong's existing social system and lifestyles will remain
unchanged for 50 years after July 1, 1997, he said.
</P>
<P>
"we trust the commitment of the Chinese government. That is why
we are so optimistic about Hong Kong's development and confident
in its future," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Republic Of Korea announced last month it would extend free
entry to passport holders of the Hong Kong Special Administrative
Region.
</P>
<P>
Referring to economic relations between the ROK and Hong Kong,
Park said that bilateral trade has increased at an annual rate of
10 percent in the past few years. Bilateral trade volume came to
12 billion US dollars last year.
</P>
<P>
To date, the ROK has set up 750 companies and 80 financial
institutions in Hong Kong. ROK mainly exports electronic products,
raw materials and plastic products to Hong Kong, while importing
machinery and parts, textiles, watches, electronic and optical
products from Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
ROK's investment in Hong Kong is not large, estimated at 339
million US dollars, while Hong Kong's investment in the ROK totals
652 million US dollars.
</P>
<P>
However, he noted, Hong Kong is an international trade and
financial center, as well as a gateway to China and to other Asian
countries.
</P>
<P>
Many foreign companies do business via Hong Kong with countries
in Asia and other regions, he said. Last year, ROK's investment
in China exceeded three billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong has been a popular tourist destination for most ROK
residents. An estimated 400,000 ROK residents visited Hong Kong
last year. The number is expected to reach half a million soon.
</P>
<P>
The ROK has opened an air route from Seoul to Hong Kong, set up
the Korean Resident Association and the Korean Chamber of
Commerce. In 1994, it opened an international school with 372
pupils from 15 countries and regions.
</P>
<P>
The consul general said that he is not a stranger to Hong Kong
though he assumed his current post in March last year, because he
had stayed here for eight years previously.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the view that the success of Hong Kong lies in the
rule of law, convenient information and clean civil service. All
these factors are combined together to make Hong Kong a very
attractive place for business and tourism.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the belief that after July 1, 1997, ROK investors
will certainly have more opportunities in Hong Kong.

<HEADLINE> Baht Hits 14-Year High on Offshore Markets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, June 18 (Xinhua) -- The baht Tuesday jumped to a
14-year high against the US dollar as the Thai central bank took
measures to stabilize the baht.
</P>
<P>
The baht was traded as high as 22.90 to the dollar on offshore
markets in the late afternoon, but eased to 23.05 later, according
to reports reaching here said today.
</P>
<P>
The baht also rose on the local market as the Bank of Thailand
set its official mid-point rate at 25.77 baht against the dollar.
</P>
<P>
The Thai central bank imposed a number of measures to curb
speculation overseas in May and successfully checked the
devaluation trend, but the measures triggered a serious slump on
the local stock market where speculators panically sold stocks to
cash in the baht.
</P>
<P>
The local stock market continued to slip these days. On
Tuesday, the Stock Exchange of Thailand index fell to 497.72
points, the lowest since March 1989.

<HEADLINE> Fugitive Official Accused of Heading Gang </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PANAMA CITY, June 17 (Xinhua) -- Panamanian police are accusing
Vallarino Aleman, the fugitive advisor to Panamanian second Vice
President Felipe Virzi, of being the head of a gang which has
stolen Rolex and Cartier watches for the past four years
</P>
<P>
The advisor travelled frequently to Miami in the United States
to sell watches, stolen in Panama, for about 5,000 U.S. dollars
apiece, Judicial Technical Police Director Alejandro Moncada said
today.
</P>
<P>
Aleman was responsible for providing cover for the thieves by
using a vehicle with Panama's national coat-of-arms, a siren,
flashing lights and radio-communications equipment, the police
chief alleged.
</P>
<P>
Rolex watches are worth between 4,000-25,000 dollars, and
Aleman may be hiding in Costa Rica or the United States, Moncada
said.
</P>
<P>
He said the former advisor's office was "collaborating closely"
in the inquiries that led to the discovery of the felony.
</P>
<P>
Panamanian authorities have requested cooperation by the
International Police (Interpol) in the United States and Costa
Rica in pursuing the fugitive.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, John Barton, a Canadian businessman, was ambushed in a
neighborhood of Panama City and shot to death by a man who stole
his Rolex watch. But Moncada said Aleman's participation in this
particular crime has not been established.
</P>
<P>
The investigations and surveillance of the Rolex-stealing gang
began at least a year ago, and intensified eight months
ago.

<HEADLINE> Photo Exhibition on Hong Kong Opens in Romania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, June 17 (Xinhua) -- A photo exhibition on Hong
Kong's return to China opened here today, two weeks before China
resumes the exercise of sovereignty over the region on July 1,
ending Britain's 150-year colonial rule.
</P>
<P>
The exhibition is composed of four parts -- Hong Kong's
history, Hong Kong people's patriotic enthusiasm, efforts made by
the Chinese government to resume the exercise of sovereignty over
Hong Kong and Deng Xiaoping's "one country, two systems" concept.
</P>
<P>
The exhibition was co-sponsored by the Chinese Embassy in
Romania with the Romanian Foreign Ministry and Culture Ministry.
More than 400 dignitaries attended the opening ceremony, including
Chairman of the Chamber of Deputies (house of representatives) Jan
Diaconescu.
</P>
<P>
Diaconescu said Hong Kong's return to China was a major world
event and had been achieved through peaceful means, which was an
inspiration in settling international disputes.
</P>
<P>
He praised China for its patience and foresight in settling the
Hong Kong issue and termed Hong Kong's return as China's "great
political victory".
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Water Shortage Seen in Philippines: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 18 (Xinhua) -- An acute shortage in water and
agricultural supplies is expected to happen in the Philippines in
1997-1998 period due to the El Nino weather phenomenon, the local
press reports said today.
</P>
<P>
Scientists at the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and
Astronomical Services Administration were quoted as saying that El
Nino, a recurring and devastating weather phenomenon in the
Pacific, is affecting the country.
</P>
<P>
The scientists said the delayed onset of the rainy season in
the country was a result of the early development of El Nino.
</P>
<P>
They said the onset of the rainy season, which normally occurs
during the second half of May, was delayed by about two weeks due
to the El Nino episode.
</P>
<P>
El Nino, which appears every two to seven years, is a
large-scale oceanographic and meteorological phenomenon that
develops in the Pacific Ocean. It can cause torrential rains and
storms in South America and drought in Australia, Indonesia and
the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
The weathermen warned that assessment of present atmospheric
and oceanographic conditions in the tropical Pacific showed there
is a strong potential for further development of the El Nino
episode in the next few months.
</P>
<P>
They said El Nino could result in drought in the country, which
will lead to shortage in food and water supplies, reduction in the
productivity and other socio-economic problems.
</P>
<P>
Records from the weather bureau showed the worst El
Nino-related drought in the Philippines happened in 1982 and 1990
respectively, both causing big economic losses in the country.

<HEADLINE> El Nino Heat Affects Peruvian Coasts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LIMA, June 17 (Xinhua) -- Higher temperatures in Peruvian
coastal waters, with a drop in fish catches and atmospheric
disturbances along the Pacific coastline, are blamed by experts on
the "El Nino" phenomonon.
</P>
<P>
The National Meteorology and Hydrology Service (Senamhi) said
surface water temperatures in the ocean will remain up to 4
degrees C. above normal off Peru's northern and central coasts,
and from 2 to 3 degrees off the southern coasts.
</P>
<P>
The current of warm water that emerged a few weeks ago on the
northern coast has now extended up to 40 miles (74 kilometers)
seawards, where ocean temperatures are 3 degrees C. above normal.
</P>
<P>
In the southern part of the country, the higher temperature of
surface waters is causing disturbances in atmospheric pressure,
mainly in what is known as the Pacific anticyclone.
</P>
<P>
The changes produced by the El Nino phenomenon have begun to
cause damage in some sectors, such as fisheries.
</P>
<P>
The changes in ocean temperatures cause a considerable drop in
the catch of fish species, such as anchovies and sardines which
are essential for the production of fish meal.
</P>
<P>
The scarcity of anchovies along the northern coastline of the
Arequipa department forced the shutdown of the local fish meal
processing plant four days ago.
</P>
<P>
In the northern region of Piura, regional authorities have met
every week to evaluate emergency programs, and to prevent damage
that could be caused by El Nino.

<HEADLINE> Residents to Pay for Draining of Tap Water </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Residents in Chinese cities paying
for their daily supply of water will soon have to pay for the
practice of allowing the water to vanish down the drain, according
to today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
The move, first introduced in the south China city of Shenzhen,
is aimed at curbing over-consumption and pollution of urban water
resources, the paper cited a central government official as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Residents in the Shenzhen Special Economic Zone have been told
they will have to pay for water drainage beginning August 1.
</P>
<P>
"This has become a necessity and should be enforced as soon as
possible," said Ding Wuhe, a Ministry of Construction official.
</P>
<P>
Ding said that his ministry and the State Planning Commission
have prepared a report for the State Council for approval,
detailing measures on how to collect the fees.
</P>
<P>
The formal approval is expected soon, according to Ding, who
explained that "the practice has actually been stipulated in the
amendment of the Water Pollution Prevention Law, which came into
effect last year."
</P>
<P>
He said the municipal authorities of some local cities,
including the special economic zone of Shenzhen, have worked out
measures on collecting fees.
</P>
<P>
Factories that dispose of large amounts of waste water and
cause water pollution are already being charged in Chinese cities.
</P>
<P>
According to the Shenzhen practice, drainage charges for water
used by urban families and government organizations account for 30
percent of the costs of tap water.
</P>
<P>
Industrial and commercial departments have to pay drainage fees
that are equivalent to 20 percent of the costs of tap water.
</P>
<P>
The prices of tap water in Chinese cities are usually less than
one yuan per ton.
</P>
<P>
"Such fee-collection standards are not high compared to the
cost of waste water treatment, but considerations should certainly
be given to the economic development levels of different areas in
China so that the fees are acceptable," said Ding.
</P>
<P>
He said funds collected will be used in the construction and
operation of water treatment facilities.
</P>
<P>
Statistics from the Ministry of Construction indicate that more
than 30 billion cubic meters of waste water is not treated for or
made harmless to human health because of the shortage of funds and
the lack of awareness of environmental protection, according to
Ding.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
The new company, the Costa Habana Inmobiliaria, S.A., will
operate on a 50-50 basis for 10 years in Cuban real estate and its
first project is to build a 175-unit apartment building in
Miramar, a downtown neighborhood in Havana.

</P>
<P>
At the end of 1996, there were 260 companies operating in Cuba

The investments come from about 40 countries, mainly Canada,
Spain, Mexico, Italy, France and Britain, and focus on tourism,
mining, manufacture and telecommunications.

<P>
KUNMING, June 18 (Xinhua) -- The local government of southwest
China's Yunnan Province has formed a team of armed patrolmen to
protect the tropical rainforest and rare wild animals in
Xishuangbanna, a national nature reserve.
</P>
<P>
The team members, dominated by armed police and employees at
the reserve, have caught 22 poachers and confiscated 18 hunting
rifles over the past ten days.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, they investigated some 80 restaurants in the area
and punished some owners who illegally sell meat of wild
animals. They have rescued many rare animals and returned them to
the forest.
</P>
<P>
Xishuangbanna in southwest Yunnan earned its reputation as "a
kingdom of plants and animals" for its more than 20,000 species of
plants, 429 species of birds and 67 species of animals in over
466,000 hectares of rainforest.
</P>
<P>
However, poaching and illegal lumbering have endangered the
precious natural resources, causing millions in economic losses
annually.
</P>
<P>
Yunnan's legislative body has enacted a series of laws on the
protection of wild animals and plants.

WASHINGTON, June 17 (Xinhua) -- Macedonian President Kiro
Gligorov today asked the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)
peacekeeping forces stay on in Bosnia beyond their stated
departure time.
</P>
<P>
Following his meeting with United States President Bill
Clinton, Gligorov told reporters that some or all of the
peacekeeping troops could stay in his country.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. has decided to pull out all its troops by June 1998,
and the Europeans said they would do the same.
</P>
<P>
"I firmly believe that the presence of the peace (keeping)
forces has greatly contributed to settling the issue and ending
the senseless war there," Gligorov said.
</P>
<P>
"It ended the killings of the people. It ended ethnic
cleansing. And therefore I believe that their remaining on the
Balkans and in this region, where Macedonia is also located, would
be very positive," he added.
</P>
<P>
White House spokesman Michael McCurry said the two presidents
focused on keeping stability and peace in the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
Clinton expressed continuing U.S. support for the stability of
the former Yugoslav republic of Macedonia and the region as a

MANILA, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Military officials from the
Philippines and the United States will begin their two-day annual
meeting of the Philippines-U.S. Mutual Defense Board here today.
</P>
<P>
Philippine Armed Forces Chief of Staff Gen. Arnulfo Acedera and
U.S. Admiral Joseph Prueher, commander-in-chief of the U.S.
Pacific Command, will lead their respective delegations in the
meeting.
</P>
<P>
Sources in the Philippine Defense Department said earlier the
board is scheduled to discuss the "overall" military relationship
of the Philippines and the United States.
</P>
<P>
The board will also renegotiate a Status of Forces Agreement,
which will serve as the legal framework for future
Philippines-U.S. joint military training exercises.
</P>
<P>
The United States rejected earlier a draft agreement prepared
by the Philippine government which deleted the grant of diplomatic
immunity to U.S. soldiers during the conduct of exercises.
</P>
<P>
Washington wants its soldiers immune from criminal charges
throughout the training period.
</P>
<P>
Because of a failure to agree on the matter, the two
governments decided to temporarily suspend all joint military
exercise until the signing of a new agreement.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine government also suspended its joint military
exercises with other countries, including Singapore and Britain,
due to the re-negotiation of the agreement on foreign soldiers'
status in the country.

<P>
SHANGHAI, June 18 (Xinhua) -- The Deutsche Bank AG, Europe's
biggest bank, has agreed to fund the raising of a panda in the
Wolong Nature Reserve in Southwest China's Sichuan Province.
</P>
<P>
For one year, the bank will cover the costs of bringing up the
2.5-year-old male giant panda, according to Johannes Schoeter, who
is in charge of the bank's China operation.
</P>
<P>
China's giant panda is a treasure of mankind, Mr. Schoeter
said. And his bank would like to make its due contributions to the
protection and research of the rare animal.
</P>
<P>
Stephen Harner, head of the bank's representative office in
Shanghai, said that the bank is considering developing broader
ties with China, not only in large cities like Beijing and
Shanghai and some coastal areas, but also in China's interior
areas.
</P>
<P>
He said that the bank plans to open a branch in Shanghai and
hopes to invest in several other projects in Sichuan Province.
</P>
<P>
China is the only natural home of giant panda. It is estimated
that there are only 1,000 giant pandas living in the wild and
captivity.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, Chinese scientists have made marked progress
in artificial breeding of giant pandas.

<HEADLINE> UFO Seen in Argentina </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUENOS AIRES, June 17 (Xinhua) -- Three policemen who were
travelling in a vehicle in the central province of La Pampa,
Argentina, said they were followed by a bright flying object that
they suspected it was an unidentified flying object (UFO).
</P>
<P>
The event occurred last Saturday but was not published by
the press until Tuesday. The policemen were identified as David
Gallego, Jose Cerna y Pilar Badal who were all travelling from
Telen to Victoria, in the province of La Pampa.
</P>
<P>
According to the policemen, they first thought that the
unidentified flying object was just the moon.
</P>
<P>
"It was an enormous semioval light, orange colored and with a
beam of light shining upwards and it followed us for 13
kilometers, said the witnesses.
</P>
<P>
The UFO emerged from inside a mountain and flew in the same
direction as the police car and then surged ahead southward to
disappear into the Caldenal mountains once again.
</P>
<P>
The police said that neither their car nor their radio
equipment experienced any mechanical failure at any time.
</P>
<P>
The sighting of UFOs is not novel in this zone, where some time
ago three hunters were followed by a flying object with powerful
light for 200 kilometers.

<HEADLINE> China Cracks Down on Illegal Pyramid Selling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 18 (Xinhua) -- China has banned more than 200
enterprises from organizing multi-layer pyramid selling and
uncovered more than 500 cases of illegal pyramid schemes.
</P>
<P>
The country has promulgated the provisional regulations on the
management of pyramid selling in a bid to standardize the practice
that, if it is done well, may help save advertising and
circulation fees. But there have been many enterprises that had
attempted to take the law in their own hands and continued their
illegal practices. They included the Zhongshan Zaifa Industrial
Co., the Dongguan Xingtian Co. and the Harbin Dongfang Jewelry
World.
</P>
<P>
An official from the State Administration for Industry and
Commerce said that the enterprises took advantage of the special
practice of pyramid schemes to cheat consumers, spread
superstitious ideas and cultural trashes, infringe upon the rights
and interests of consumers and disrupt normal economic order, thus
affecting the social stability.
</P>
<P>
"This is both an economic and a political issue," said the
official.
</P>
<P>
The pyramid selling is still in the stage of experiment and the
consumers are not mature psychologically and easy to be taken in
as they are eager to get rich quickly, the official said.
</P>
<P>
He said that his Administration will continue the efforts to
enforce strictly the regulations on the management of pyramid
selling and come down mercilessly on illegal schemes that are
harmful to both the economy and the society.

<HEADLINE> Liaoning Marks World Anti-Desertification Day </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, June 18 (Xinhua) -- More than 10,000 people in
northeast China's Liaoning Province have joined in a signature
activity to support the country's fight against desertification.
</P>
<P>
The activity on Tuesday was part of a nationwide campaign,
which involved over one million people, to mark the World Day to
Combat Desertification and Drought.
</P>
<P>
Liaoning is one of China's provinces challenged by serious
problems of desertification and drought. About 43,000 square
kilometers of land area in its western part have turned into
desert, accounting for 30 percent of its total land area.
</P>
<P>
Forestry, water conservation and agricultural authorities of
Liaoning have mobilized local people to carry out
desertification-control work in the past years, such as planting
trees to form shelter-forests and control soil erosion.
</P>
<P>
In China, more than 2.6 million sq.km. of land area has been
affected by desertification, accounting for 27.3 percent of the
total, according to Minister of Forestry Xu Youfang.
</P>
<P>
The country's direct economic loss caused by desertification
has reached about 54 billion yuan (6.5 billion US dollars) each
year, he said in Beijing Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Villages Ink Pumping Stations Agreement with German Firm </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Zhejiang Provincial Science and
Technology Commission has signed an agreement with a German
association on helping 100 villages in the less-developed areas of
China's Zhejiang and Sichuan provinces build hydraulic ram pumping
stations that use neither fuel nor electricity before the year 2001.
</P>
<P>
According to experts, the novel piece of pumping equipment is
based on the principle that the pressure of water flowing in a
pipe will increase sharply when the flow area is suddenly
reduced. Consequently, the water rises to a higher place.
</P>
<P>
The device consumes neither fuel nor electricity, and is
suitable for mountainous areas.
</P>
<P>
The Bremen Overseas Research and Development Association of
Germany began the cooperative effort with Zhejiang in 1987.
</P>
<P>
Up to now, more than 40,000 people in 60 villages of Zhejiang
and Sichuan provinces have benefited from the project.

<HEADLINE> Britain Welcomes Re-opening of Pak-India Dialogue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, June 17 (Xinhua) -- The British government welcomes
the recent re-opening of dialogue between Pakistan and India, said
visiting British Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth
Affairs Derek Fatchett.
</P>
<P>
Fatchett said in a news release that Britain could play a role
in resolving the Kashmir dispute if desired by Pakistan and India.
</P>
<P>
"We in Britain welcome the dialogue that has recommenced
between Pakistan and India," he said.
</P>
<P>
Fatchett hoped that the recent initiatives of Pakistan's Prime
Ministers Nawaz Sharif and his Indian counterpart Inder K. Gujral
will soon bear fruit.
</P>
<P>
"I have also repeated our offer of our good offices if that
will assist the talks and it is wished by the parties," said
Fatchett.
</P>
<P>
However, Fatchett said, the British offer in no way undermines
her view that talks between the two Governments offer the "best
way of resolving all the problems between India and Pakistan,
including Kashmir".
</P>
<P>
He supported the efforts of the U.N. Special Mission in
Afghanistan. "We look to Pakistan to use its influence with the
warring parties in favor of a negotiated solution under U.N.
auspices."
</P>
<P>
Britain, Fatchett said, recognized that Pakistan had suffered
from the continuing conflict in Afghanistan and stood to benefit
from a peaceful resolution.
</P>
<P>
The British Foreign Minister lauded commitment by the Pakistani
Government to democracy and the rule of law. "We attach the
greatest importance to the proper and safe guarding of human
rights and fundamental freedoms in Pakistan," he added.
</P>
<P>
Britain has been the largest foreign investor in Pakistan this
year and last. It is also one of Pakistan's biggest trading
partners, and one of its largest aid donors.
</P>
<P>
The new British Government, Fatchett said, was keen to build on
that firm base. "Britain already cooperates closely with Pakistan
in trying to combat the drugs trade which menaces both our
societies," he said.
</P>
<P>
Fatchett is here on a three-day official visit to Pakistan.

<P>
SAN JOSE, June 17 (Xinhua) -- Horacio Coredero, the
Argentina-born coach of the Costa Rican national soccer team, is
under intense fire after his army suffered two losses in Copa
America which are currently being played in Bolivia.
</P>
<P>
Costa Rica was drubbed 5-0 by Brazil in its first cup match
last Saturday and trounced again 4-1 by Colombia on Monday, which
has effectively sent them home.
</P>
<P>
Local media was philosophic about their national boys' defeat
to World Champion Brazil and even admitted that Costa Rica was
playing out quality soccer, especially during the first hour of
the game.
</P>
<P>
But its loss to Colombia changed the tone of the
critics. "Shame" and "Pitiful" was the verdict from the national
press for the two group match humiliations.
</P>
<P>
Cordero, whose relations with the press have always been tense,
is receiving media shellings. He is being panned for employing
offside-defence tactics which is dull and lackluster and for using
players in positions to which they are not accustomed.
</P>
<P>
Yet the Argentine is fighting against all the odds by
insistting that the results do not reflect the true difference
between Costa Rican and South American soccer powerhouses.
</P>
<P>
Costa Rica has only Mexico to face in their remaining group
match in Santa Cruz on Thursday.

<HEADLINE> EU Leaders Agree to Postpone Decision on Voting System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMSTERDAM, June 17 (Xinhua) -- European Union leaders,
struggling into the night on Tuesday towards finalizing the new
draft EU treaty, agreed to postpone a key decision on
institutional reform until the Union is enlarged to embrace new
members from eastern Europe in the next decade.
</P>
<P>
The agreement came after a deadlock between big countries
seeking more votes to enforce their influence, and small states
opposing the proposed pro-big-states voting system revision,
fearing losing already limited voices in Union affairs.
</P>
<P>
"There is an agreement on the institution, in the sense that
they (member states) will decide what to do at the moment of
enlargement," a senior EU official told reporters.
</P>
<P>
The accord reached shortly before midnight on the second day of
a EU summit designed to adopt a new EU treaty as the 15-nation
bloc enters into the 21st century.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 17 (Xinhua) -- Lawmakers in both House of
Representatives and Senate of the United States are preparing a
push to end racial or gender preferences in government hiring,
contracting and other practices.
</P>
<P>
The effort comes three days after President Bill Clinton
outlined his goal to narrow racial divides plaguing the nation,
splits that affirmative action programs were designed to heal.
</P>
<P>
Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican from Kentucky, who is
leading the effort in the Senate, called it "the next step in our
nation's struggle to overcome discrimination."
</P>
<P>
McConnell is planning legislation similar to a bill Florida
Republican Representative Charles Canady introduced today to end
racial or gender preferences in government hiring, contracting and
other practices.
</P>
<P>
President Clinton favors affirmative action programs to help
women and minorities. Those programs sprang from the civil rights
movement three decades ago.

<HEADLINE> Committee to Celebrate Return of Hong Kong Announces </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, June 17 (Xinhua) --Thousands of Chinese-Americans
will parade down Broadway on July 6 in a colorful celebration of
ethnic pride to welcome the return of Hong Kong to the motherland
and the end of colonialism.
</P>
<P>
This was formally announced today to American and Chinese media
at a news conference organized by the Committee to Celebrate the
Return of Hong Kong at the statue of Confucius in the heart of
Chinatown.
</P>
<P>
The parade, the first-ever Chinese Cultural Heritage Parade in
New york City that takes the celebration beyond the borders of
Chinatown, will consist of more than 100 organizations from the
greater New York metropolitan area and will include an 85-foot
dragon, 20 floats, 3 marching bands and 7 dance troupes. One of
the highlights of the event will be a Beijing Opera troupe which
will perform an entire Chinese opera while parading down Broadway.
</P>
<P>
"As this parade is to take place two days after America's
Independence Day and six days after the return of Hong Kong to the
motherland after a century-and-half of British colonial rule, it
will be a double celebration," said Charles P. Wang, executive
director of the Committee to Celebrate the Return of Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
"Our goal is to share with our fellow Americans the richness
and diversity of our culture," Wang added.
</P>
<P>
Kai Sing Wong, chairman of the Committee to Celebrate the
Return of Hong Kong, said that Chinese-Americans view the return
of Hong Kong "as a celebration to welcome the end of colonialism
and the righting of an historical wrong."
</P>
<P>
He urged all Americans, as well as many immigrant groups to
gather along the parade route and join with Chinese-Americans.
</P>
<P>
It was also announced at today's news conference that there
would also be a Chinatown parade on June 30 that kicks off the
week-long celebration of the return of Hong Kong. On July 3, there
will be a gala concert at Lincoln Center.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Navy Subs New Communication Strategy Called </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 17 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. submarine fleet is in
danger of operational irrelevance if it does not embrace a new
communication system strategy, several U.S. Navy admirals warned.
</P>
<P>
Today, operations dictate that submarines operate closer to
enemy shores, remain in constant communication with battle group
and theater commanders and have the requisite systems to instantly
communicate intelligence data gleaned from offshore reconnaissance
to national leaders, the Defense News said in its latest edition.
</P>
<P>
However, the submarine force does not have those systems today,
and the service may not be earmarking the right systems to perform
those missions in the New Attack Submarine either, the admirals
warned.
</P>
<P>
"The submarine force is marginally equipped today in terms of
communications connectivity," said Rear Adm. Robert Frick, in a
June 5 presentation to the Naval Submarine League's annual
symposium in Alexandria, Va.
</P>
<P>
"Unless we undertake some dynamic changes in command, control,
communications, computers and intelligence, we are not going to be
a player," Frick said.
</P>
<P>
The admirals called for more fundings to upgrade the systems on
the submarines.
</P>
<P>
Key systems the sub force is seeking to deploy on current and
future submarines include more satellite antennas, which will
increase the amount of data submarines can transmit and receive;
development of a fully automated radio room; and information
processing systems that will speed data the submarine can process
simultaneously, the News said.

<HEADLINE> Past-due Credit Card Accounts Decline in US </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 17 (Xinhua) -- The number of Americans falling
behind on their credit card bills dropped a bit during the first
quarter of the year from a record high at the end of 1996.
</P>
<P>
The delinquency rate -- the percentage of accounts 30 or more
days overdue -- declined to a seasonally adjusted 3.51 percent in
the first quarter, compared with 3.72 percent in the fourth
quarter, the American Bankers Association reported today.
</P>
<P>
But the rate was still far above what was three and four years
ago, when delinquency rates in the U.S. fluctuated between 2.5
percent and 3 percent.
</P>
<P>
Increased delinquencies have coincided with an explosion in
personal bankruptcies, which reached a record 1.19 million during
the 12 months ended March 31, despite robust economic growth and a
low unemployment rate.
</P>
<P>
While the delinquency rate improved for credit cards, it hit a
new high for home equity lines of credit, rising to 1.20 percent
from 1.04 percent in the fourth quarter and 0.82 percent a year
ago.
</P>
<P>
The bankers association said a composite delinquency rate for a
variety of closed-end consumer loans -- as opposed to open-ended
credit such as credit cards and home equity lines -- rose from
2.34 percent in the fourth quarter to 2.47 percent in the first,
the highest level in five years.

<P>
LONDON, June 17 (Xinhua) -- Former Chancellor Kenneth Clarke
topped the second round of the Tory leadership contest today with
64 votes.
</P>
<P>
The other two contenders, William Hague, former Welsh Secretary
and John Redwood, former cabinet minister, polled 62 and 38 votes
respectively.
</P>
<P>
There was no outright winner as Clarke failed to secure the 83
votes needed to be elected leader.
</P>
<P>
But Clarke's backers were confident their man would pick up
enough votes from the Redwood camp to carry him to victory.
</P>
<P>
"I think today is an extremely encouraging result. I'm glad
we're now in the final furlong, but I think we're obviously going
to win," Clarke said.
</P>
<P>
He accused Hague of changing his position several times before
finally demanding that any MPs who wanted to serve in his
"shadow" cabinet must declare their opposition to scrapping the
pound.
</P>
<P>
"I'm well satisfied with the results of the second ballot
... I think I now have the momentum and the support to win the
third ballot on Thursday," said Hague, who at 36 would be the
youngest Conservative leader in more than 200 years, if he wins
the contest.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Concerned over Turkish Exercises Near Cyprus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 17 (Xinhua) -- The United States on Tuesday
expressed concerns over reports of Turkish military exercises near
the island of Cyprus and asked Ankara to explain its actions.
</P>
<P>
"We 're very concerned about the reports of the movement of
Turkish naval vessels," State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns
told reporters. "The United States, frankly, does not know the
reasons behind these reported military naval maneuvers."
</P>
<P>
The Cypriot government on Tuesday lodged a complaint with the
United Nations, claiming 16 Turkish jets had overflown the
Turkish-occupied northern part of the divided island. It also said
warships had docked at the ports of Famagusta and Kyrenia in that
region.
</P>
<P>
Turkish press reports said two frigates, three submarines, one
destroyer and three missile boats were involved.
</P>
<P>
"We think it's very important that all the parties involved in
trying to resolve the Cyprus dispute, not take any unilateral
measures that would disrupt in any way the United
Nations-sponsored peace talks," Burns said.
</P>
<P>
The island has been divided since Turkey invaded the northern
third of the island in July 1974 to protect the Turkish Cypriot
minority in the wake of an abortive coup by supporters of union
with Greece.
</P>
<P>
Talks aimed at resolving the crisis are scheduled to begin
next month at the United Nations.

BONN, June 17 (Xinhua) -- The German government is planning to

The widely circulated newspaper Bild quoted reliable sources in

</P>

Another about 17 billion marks (about 9.6 billion dollars) is

<P>
LUANDA, June 17 (Xinhua) -- The UN Angola Verification Mission
(UNAVEM) issued a communique here today declaring that the
situation in northeastern Angola is "still tense".
</P>
<P>
The communique said that the 16-member UNAVEM, headed by
Commander Philip Sibanda, heard "tense gunfire" in the Luia area,
Lundanorte Province in northeastern Angola when they reached
there yesterday, but failed to find the cause for the gunfire.
</P>
<P>
It said some of the UNAVEM members were harassed by men from
the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA).
</P>
<P>
The UNITA interpreted this as a protest against the UN mission's
statement made on June 14 stressing that "there was no conflict
in Lundanorte Province."
</P>
<P>
In fact, the UN mission said that the situation there was
"quiet", and there was no sign of battles between government
troops and UNITA forces.
</P>
<P>
Situation in northeastern Angola has become tense in the past
days after government troops and UNITA forces opened fire at
each other for several times.
</P>
<P>
The Joint Commission Overseeing the Peace Process in Angola, a
group made of members from the UN peace mission, the Angolan
government and UNITA, is scheduled to hold a meeting to discuss

TEHRAN, June 17 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President-elect Mohammad
Khatami met today with Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, who
arrived here Monday for talks with Iranian leaders on the Afghan
crisis.
</P>
<P>
This was the first time for the 54-year-old new president to

</P>
<P>
Khatami, who will take over power from outgoing President

reinforcing relations with other countries, especially with the
regional states.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that peace and security are prerequisites for

Pakistan which share a common border and access to the Indian
Ocean would serve to consolidate peace and stability in the
region.

<P>
Referring to the Afghan crisis, he termed the living
conditions of the Afghan people as "deplorable."
</P>
<P>
The Islamic and historical mission of the two neighboring
countries of Iran and Pakistan require them, as well as other
regional states, to encourage the warring parties to hold peace
talks and reach a logical settlement, Khatami added.
</P>
<P>
On Pakistan-India dispute over Kashmir, Khatami expressed hope
that the current negotiations between the two countries would
serve to normalize Islamabad-New Delhi relations, and trilateral
relations would be formed among Iran, Pakistan and India.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Nawaz Sharif said Pakistan has special relations
with Iran and the new Pakistani government has based its diplomacy
on further strengthening ties with the Muslim neighbor.
</P>
<P>
On the Afghan crisis, Sharif said Pakistan believes that the
Afghan crisis has no military solution and the rival factions
should reach settlement at the negotiating table.
</P>
<P>
Sharif invited Khatami to visit Islamabad after taking office
in August.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan is widely believed to have given financial and
military backing to the Taliban Islamic militia, a faction that
captured the Afghan capital of Kabul in September and took control
of two-thirds of the country.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan was also the first country to recognize the Taliban
government.
</P>
<P>
Taliban repeatedly accused Iran of supporting the ousted
government of President Burhanuddin Rabbani.
</P>
<P>
Iran has denied giving military assistance to any of the Afghan
factions, saying it had sent only humanitarian aid.

<HEADLINE> Campaign to Downlist Minke Whale Loses Out </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, June 17 (Xinhua) -- The countries advocating for the
downlisting of the minke whale from appendix one to appendix two have
to try again in two years after losing the fight by 51 votes to 57 on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
A spokesperson for the Norway-based Friends of the Haapoon,
Lilian Selvik, said they lost the vote during the ongoing 10th
Conference of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered
Species (CITES) because the International Whaling Commission did not
understand the magnitude of the problem posed by the whale.
</P>
<P>
The minke whale is found in the northeast Atlantic and is
estimated to number over 100,000.
</P>
<P>
Fishing the whale, which is used mainly as a relish, was
banned by the International Whaling Commission in 1987. enditem

<HEADLINE> Erekat Criticizes Netanyahu's Settlement Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 17 (Xinhua) -- A senior Palestinian official
today accused Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu of giving
the "green light" to settlement activities throughout the West
Bank and Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
During an interview with Israel Radio, top Palestinian
negotiator Saeb Erekat said Netanyahu apparently allowed Jewish
settlers "to do something everyday, somewhere," in expanding
settlements.
</P>
<P>
Erekat expressed his hope that Netanyahu would understand his
settlement policy was "shutting down" the peace process.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks after Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa
hinted today that Egyptian shuttle diplomacy between Israel and
the Palestinians would come to a stop.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after a meeting with Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak, Moussa said that there was "no discussion" in bringing
back presidential adviser Osama el-Baz for further consultation
between Israel and the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
"The peace process is going through a huge crisis," said the
Egyptian foreign minister. "A huge gap still exists (between
Israel and the Palestinians)."
</P>
<P>
In the last few weeks, el-Baz held a series of talks with
Netanyahu and Palestinian Authority President Yasser Arafat, in
an effort to bring the two sides back to the negotiating table.
</P>
<P>
However, his shuttle diplomacy apparently failed in making any
real progress, as violent confrontations between Israeli soldiers
and the Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza Strip continued
for the fourth consecutive day today.
</P>
<P>
Erekat said that the Palestinians were willing to support the
Egyptian effort in helping the two sides to resume peace talks,
but he stressed that the Jewish settlement activity was a big
obstacle.
</P>
<P>
"We should agree openly only to solve our problems through
negotiations, not through terror, not through bulldozers (to
expand settlements), not through confiscating land, and not
through settlements," he said.
</P>
<P>
Peace talks between Israel and the Palestinians have been
stalled since March when Israel started to build a controversial
new Jewish neighborhood at Har Homa (Jabal Abu Ghneim) on the
southeastern outskirts of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Palestinians have said that Israel must stop the construction
before talks can resume, while Israel insists that the Palestinian
National Authority must crack down on terror and re-establish full
security cooperation.

<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, June 17 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian President
Benjamin Mkapa has invited more businessmen from China to invest
in his country, to further cement the existing good co-operative
and friendly relations between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Speaking with the out-going Chinese Ambassador to Tanzania,

farewell, President Mkapa said the friendly relationship
established by the leaders of the old generation, retired

Late Premier Zhuo Enlai should be nurtured and maintained by both
sides at present.
</P>
<P>
Mkapa said the frequent exchange of visits between the two
sides have made the bilateral relations more dynamic and
productive.
</P>
<P>
"Tanzania thanks Premier Li Peng's recent successful visit to
Tanzania and is ready to work side by side with China to give a new
impetus to the development of economic and trade ties between the two
nations by improving Tanzania's capabilities of attracting more
Chinese enterprises for various forms of co-operation of mutual
benefit," he told the ambassador.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, President Mkapa asked the Chinese ambassador to
convey his best regards to Chinese President Jiang Zemin and
Premier Li Peng, and expressed optimism that the friendship
between Tanzania and China will be further strengthened.

<HEADLINE> Minister: Iraq Concerns over UNSCOM's Missions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, June 17 (Xinhua) -- Iraq has expressed its serious
concerns over the missions of the U.N. Special Commission
(UNSCOM), the official Iraqi News Agency (INA) reported today.
</P>
<P>
In a letter addressed Monday to the U.N. Security Council
President Sergev Lavrov, Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz
said the UNSCOM's missions were meant to "take advantage of the
facilities available as a cover to gain access to Iraq's security
systems" rather than to carry out the commission's tasks defined
by relevant U.N. resolutions.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that his country's concerns stem from the fact
that many of those entrusted with the inspection mission are
Americans recruited for the UNSCOM.
</P>
<P>
The repeated inquiries by Colonel Scott Ritter, a former U.S.
chief inspector, to inspect some sites are aimed to achieve other
goals "irrelevant" to the Security Council resolutions, Aziz
stressed.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has reportedly blocked U.N. inspectors from three
suspected weapons sites.
</P>
<P>
Azia strongly criticized "a particularly well-known state,"
saying its real aim behind the inspection is to "keep matters
pending and consequently maintain the embargo indefinitely."
</P>
<P>
Iraq is required to allow U.N. inspectors into any site they
choose to ensure its compliance with U.N. resolutions. The
six-year-old U.N. sanctions will not be lift until the inspectors
confirm Iraq has scrapped weapons of mass destruction.

KUWAIT CITY, June 17 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian National Authority
President Yasser Arafat arrived in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, today to
drum up support for the Palestinians in the Middle East peace
process.
</P>
<P>
He is expected to hold talks with Saudi King Fahd Ibn
Abdul-Aziz on the negative developments of the Middle East peace
process, particularly the Jerusalem issue and the Israeli
settlement policy, Kuwait News Agency reported from Jeddah.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian Ambassador in Saudi Arabia Mustafa Deeb said that
the recent U.S. congress decision to recognize Jerusalem as
Israel's capital and to move the U.S. embassy from Tel Aviv to the
holy city would also be discussed by the two leaders.
</P>
<P>
Arab countries have termed the U.S. decision as a blockade to
the Middle East peace process which came to a halt in March after
Israel broke ground for a new settlement building in disputed
East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Arafat would ask King Fahd to use his country's ties with the
United States to pressure Israel to honor its commitment to the
implementation of the Oslo peace agreements, Deeb said.
</P>
<P>
Arafat will continue his tour to other Gulf Arab countries
after concluding his visit to Saudi Arabia Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> New Fishing Venture Formed in Namibia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 17 (Xinhua) -- Uneconomic quota allocation
and poor catch-rates off the Namibian coastline have led to the
establishment of a new joint fishing venture by the country's two
major fishing companies, Kuiseb Fish Products and Consortium
Fisheries, the South African Press Association reported today.
</P>
<P>
In a joint statement in Windhoek, capital of Namibia, Chairman
of Kuiseb Fish Products Festus Naholo and Chairman of the
Ohlthaver and List Group, Kwr List, of which Consortium Fisheries
is a wholly-owned subsidiary, said they had joined forces to
overcome the difficulties which have affected the Namibian
off-shore fishing industry in recent years.
</P>
<P>
Naholo welcomed the joint venture and said he believed the new
company had the potential to play an increasingly important role
in the Namibian fishing industry, to assist the Namibian
government to achieve one of its major economic goals.
</P>
<P>
According to the statement, Ohlthaver and List Group will own
60 percent of the shares in the new company, while the partners
in Kuiseb Fish Products will hold the remaining 40 percent.

<HEADLINE> Security Issue Crucial to Cyprus Solution: FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, June 17 (Xinhua) -- Cypriot Foreign Minister Ioannis
Kasoulides stressed here today that the security issue is crucial
to a solution to the Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
The minister made the remarks upon his return from official
visits to Japan and Russia. His visits came a month before the
U.N.-sponsored direct talks between Cypriot President Glafcos
Clerides and Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash, scheduled to
begin on July 9 near New York.
</P>
<P>
Referring to his Moscow trip, where he met his Russian
counterpart Yevgeni Primakov, Kasoulides said that security, an
issue he described as "dominant and an integral part of a Cyprus
solution", was part of his discussions in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
The purchase of Russian anti-aircraft missiles by the Cypriot
government should not be isolated for discussion during the next
month's direct talks, Kasoulides pointed out.
</P>
<P>
He added that "the deployment of the Russian S-300 missiles in
Cyprus would be a negative development, but the presence of
Turkish occupation troops in Cyprus is an even more negative
development."
</P>
<P>
Cyprus and Russia have come under fire from the U.S., British
and other foreign governments after a multi-million dollar arms
deal for the purchase of the missiles was announced earlier this
year.
</P>
<P>
The Cypriot government has stressed that the purchase of the
missiles is purely for defensive purposes and has also reassured
anxious foreign governments that no missile component will be
delivered in 16 months.
</P>
<P>
On Russia's role in the forthcoming direct talks, Kasoulides
said Russia intends to play the role which all permanent members
of the Security Council are expected to play.
</P>
<P>
Outlining possible areas of "give and take" in the forthcoming
talks, Kasoulides said "the Greek Cypriot side is ready to give
political equality to the Turkish Cypriot side, as this is defined
by the U.N."
</P>
<P>
"When it comes to 'take', we consider the withdrawal of
Turkish occupation troops and the safeguard of fundamental
freedoms should be included in the list of takings," the minister
said.
</P>
<P>
Kasoulides was critical of suggestions that some 5,000 Turkish
troops could remain on the island after a solution to the Cyprus
problem is concluded.
</P>
<P>
"The presence of 5,000 Turkish troops may create a feeling of
security for the Turkish Cypriots but it creates exactly the
opposite feeling among the Greek Cypriots," Kasoulides explained.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided since 1974 when Turkish troops
invaded and took control of 37 percent of the island in the wake
of a short-lived coup seeking union with Greece.
</P>
<P>
Around 30,000 Turkish troops has been stationed in northern
Cyprus, which was declared as a breakaway state "The Turkish
Republic of Northern Cyprus" by the Turkish Cypriot side in
1983. The entity is recognized only by Turkey.

ADDIS ABABA, June 17 (Xinhua) -- An exhibition and bazaar to
mark the yearly observance of Africa Refugee Day which falls on
June 20 opened here today.
</P>
<P>
The exhibition was jointly organized by the Organization of
African Unity (OAU), the Administration for Refugee and Returnee
Affairs of Ethiopia and the United Nations High Commissioner for
Refugees (UNHCR).
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the opening ceremony, Berhanu Kebede, a senior

year's commemoration is marked in the midst of two events in
Africa: peaceful and democratic changes which enabled many
refugees to return home and conflicts that aggravated the tragic
humanitarian situation in the continent.
</P>
<P>
He added that the international community should pay close
attention to the existing refugee problem in the Horn of Africa
which seems to be "overshadowed by new emergencies in other parts
of the world".
</P>
<P>
David Lambo, UNHCR regional liaison representative for Africa,
on his part said the present African refugees' situation is
promising as a number of them are returning to their respective
homeland.
</P>
<P>
The exhibition and bazaar will remain open to the public until
June 21.

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 17 (Xinhua) -- Foreign banks operating in
South Africa are optimistic about doing business in the country
and expecting strong growth potential from the further relaxation
of exchange controls, according to a survey released here today.
</P>
<P>
A statement by Price Waterhouse, the company which conducted
the survey, said foreign banks doing business in South Africa
were optimistic about future opportunities in the local market,
noting 31 of the 70 foreign banks with a presence in South Africa
participated in the survey.
</P>
<P>
The survey indicated that the participating banks employed
1,101 people, and projected a 73 percent rise in employment over
next five years.
</P>
<P>
The banks' loan portfolio amounted to 5.45 billion US Dollars
at present and was expected to grow to around 9 billion US
Dollars by the year 2001, said the statement.
</P>
<P>
The survey also said the banks believed the lifting of
exchange controls was the single biggest change that would occur
in the local market, while other important considerations were
the proliferation of competitors, the likelihood of a shake-out
and the opportunities expected to arise from privatization.
</P>
<P>
The problem facing the companies was the lack of skilled local
personnel, which was exacerbated by the possibility of losing
staff to other banks, said the statement.

HARARE, June 17 (Xinhua) -- The three southern African
neighbors tonight lost their bid to have the elephant downlisted
from Appendix I to Appendix II of the Convention on International
Trade in Endangered Species (CITES).
</P>
<P>
Botswana, Namibia and Zimbabwe proposed that the African
elephant be downlisted from the CITES Appendix I to Appendix II,
which would allow for limited and controlled trade in the
elephant and its products.
</P>
<P>
It requires at least two thirds of the number of voting
parties to get the proposal through.
</P>
<P>
Out of the 124 registered voting parties, some 123 cast
ballots, of which 75 were in favor of downlisting with some
conditions, 41 polled against while there were seven abstentions.
</P>
<P>
During debate ahead of voting, it had become apparent that
more countries were in support of sustainable use of natural
resources.
</P>
<P>
Opposers of the downlisting proposal were mainly developed
countries and a number of African countries.
</P>
<P>
Countries from the Middle East, Asia, Latin America and North
Africa came out in full support of the downlisting.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe's Environment and Tourism Minister Chen
Chimutengwende said, "in Tokyo, Japan in 1989, we got eight votes
and this time we got 75 votes, short of majority by only three."
</P>
<P>
Chairman of the conference and Zimbabwe's ambassador to the

people are realizing that they are not guided by any sense of

<HEADLINE> Canadian Government to Target Debt Burden </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, June 17 (Xinhua) -- The Canadian government will focus
on reducing its total debt burden once the annual deficit is
eliminated, Financial Minister Paul Martin has said.
</P>
<P>
As it does so, the federal government will spend in critical
areas to encourage economic growth, the minister noted.
</P>
<P>
"As long as you are piling up debt, which is what the deficit
is about, you have to focus on the elimination of the deficit by
reducing spending," Martin was quoted by reports today as saying.
</P>
<P>
While the government plans to eliminate the deficit in two
years, many analysts believe that it could balance the federal
books as early as next year.
</P>
<P>
Despite this better-than-expected performance, Martin said his
government will not give in to pressure for big spending increases
or tax cuts before the budget is balanced.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Canada must reduce its level of debt, measured as
a percentage of the gross domestic product (GDP), Martin stressed.
</P>
<P>
At present, Canada's federal debt is about 430 billion U.S.
dollars, or 74 percent of its GDP. That's the highest in the G-7
countries, second only to Italy.
</P>
<P>
With so heavy a debt, the government pays 33 cents in interest
charges for every 1 dollar in revenue it raises as a result.
</P>
<P>
The government is committed to reducing the debt-to-GDP level
well below 60 percent within a few years, Martin said. He didn't
set targets for progress.
</P>
<P>
"You don't borrow to cut taxes and you don't borrow to spend,"
he said. "That's what got us into trouble in the first place."

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia Needs 400,000 Construction Workers for </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, June 17 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopian Minister of Works
and Urban Development Haile Asegida said today that the nation
needs close to 400,000 workers with basic construction skills for
the implementation of the development program.
</P>
<P>
In his report to the parliament, the minister said the quality
of construction works in Ethiopia has substantially deteriorated
over the past 20 years owing to the shortage of trained manpower
in basic construction skills.
</P>
<P>
Haile said the problem is mainly due to the employment of
construction workers notably masons, carpenters and electricians
who are lacking in their skills because there are very few
centers that provide training in such basic skills.
</P>
<P>
In view of these problems and the need for large number of
artisans required for the implementation of the five year
development program, the minister said, the government is making
the necessary preparations to build 25 centers that will provide
training in the basic skills.
</P>
<P>
He added that professionals were sent abroad for further
studies to add up to the launching of training programs for
senior engineers.

<HEADLINE> Need for Implementation of Program for Children, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, June 17 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopian Minister of Labor
and Social Affairs Hassen Abdella today stressed the need for
implementation of the national program of action for children and
women.
</P>
<P>
Opening a seminar here introducing the program which was
launched yesterday by President Negasso Gidada, the minister said
Ethiopian women experience excessive hardships as a result of
social, cultural, economic and psychological pressures which are
exacerbated by poverty and backwardness.
</P>
<P>
The minister said about 17,000 Ethiopian women of child
bearing age die every year of complications associated with
pregnancy and child birth.
</P>
<P>
Maternal malnutrition ranged from 10 to 38 percent leading
low-birth-weight of infants, he said, adding that the total
fertility rate stood at 7.7 children per woman while family
planning acceptance rate was only four percent.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the seminar, representative of the United Nations
Children's Fund (UNICEF) Rrn Tuluhungwa said maternal mortality,
with death from pregnancy and childbirth related causes, still
stands at an annual figure of over 700,000 and the needs of
children at risk of exploitation, abandonment and abuse are not
adequately answered and remain a major challenge, particularly in
the developing world.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Officials to Study Cruise Missile Threat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 17 (Xinhua) -- Pentagon officials have decided
to study ways to combat possible cruise missile strike against the
United States, Defense News said.
</P>
<P>
The Ballistic Missile Defense Organization (BMDO), Joint
Theater Air and Missile Defense Organization and the Atlantic
Command are planning to set up an integrated product team to study
the threats and ways to counter them, Air Force Lt. Col. Rick
Lehner, BMDO spokesman was quoted as saying last Thursday.
</P>
<P>
BMDO plans to spend about 12 million U.S. dollars in 1998
studying defenses against cruise missiles for military theaters
abroad and the United States, Air Force Lt. Gen. Lester Lyles,
director of the organization told a meeting of the Defense Writers
Group her on June 5, the News said in its June 16-22 edition.
</P>
<P>
Pentagon also promised in its Quadrennial Defense Review report
on May 19 to devote more attention to cruise missile defenses.
</P>
<P>
Cruise missiles, such as the U.S. Tomahawk, are akin to
low-flying pilotless planes. They are hard to detect amid the
radar clutter of the ground and can be preprogrammed to strike
with pinpoint accuracy.
</P>
<P>
Pentagon officials said that the availability of Global
Positioning System receivers and jet engines that can be used on
airplanes or missiles make cruise missiles a growing threat.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Increases $100 Million Aid to Jordan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 17 (Xinhua) -- Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright announced on Tuesday that the United States plans to give
Jordan an additional 100 million US dollar aid through a
newly-founded Middle East peace and stability fund as a reward for
its effort to the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
Speaking during a photo session with visiting Crown Prince
Hassan, younger brother of Jordan's King of Hussein, Albright
said: "Jordan has become a model for the Middle East and the
world, a nation truly committed to peace to building a new and
better future for all peoples."
</P>
<P>
State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns told reporters that
the money would be raised by deducting $ 50 million each from
current aid allocations to Israel and Egypt.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Egyptian
President Hosni Mubarak were reported to have agreed to the
deduction of their allocations from the U.S. aid.
</P>
<P>
Israel receives $3 billion in economic and military assistance
annually, and Egypt $2.2 billion. They are the two largest
recipients of U.S. aid -- about half the total of U.S. foreign
assistance.
</P>
<P>
U.S. aid to Jordan was canceled by Congress when the kingdom
tilted to support Iraq in the Persian Gulf War in 1991. But
Hussein's peace treaty with Israel and his efforts to assist
American mediators in trying to reopen Israeli-Palestinian
negotiations has boosted his stock with the Clinton
administration.
</P>
<P>
"We fell very strongly that aid to Jordan ought to be upgraded
and ought to be filled out and expanded, and that's what we're
working on," Burns said when the idea of increasing aid to Jordan
surfaced a few weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
The United States has been worried that popular support in
Jordan for the struggling Middle East peace process could wane
still further unless its people received tangible benefits,
observers here said.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Calls for Implement of Law Barring Sex </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 17 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
today ordered federal agencies to follow the law barring sex
discrimination in schools.
</P>
<P>
Joined by former astronaut Sally Ride and Olympian Jackie
Joyner-Kersee, President Clinton hailed at a ceremony the 25th

"We're here to celebrate the God-given talent of every woman
and girl who has been benefited by it," Clinton said at the
ceremony attended by successful women in the United States.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said the law, Title IX, did not cause women to succeed,
"but it did give them the chance to make the most of their
abilities."
</P>
<P>
A study released by the Education Department today noted that
progress has been make for women since Title IX, including
increased numbers of women in law and medicine, but women still

<HEADLINE> Canadian Economy to Show Strong Growth, Bank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, June 17 (Xinhua) -- The Canadian economy will be the
leader among the G-7 industrialized countries this year and next,
economists at one of the largest Canadian bank predicted today.
</P>
<P>
"We are now reaping the full rewards of low interest rates,"
said Ruth Getter, senior vice president and chief economist at
Toronto Dominion Bank.
</P>
<P>
Following years of deficit-cutting, Canada now boasts a
much-reduced government budget deficit, a current account surplus
and a low inflation rate.
</P>
<P>
Canadian short-term interest rates are the lowest they have
been in about 40 years, and remained about 2 percentage points
below comparable U.S interest rates since 1996.
</P>
<P>
"The outlook for the Canadian economy is the best it has been
in this decade," Getter said.
</P>
<P>
"We have gone through a long period of retrenchment and
adjustment, and we are now able to enjoy the benefits."
</P>
<P>
According to the bank, Canada's real gross domestic product
will grow at 3.5 percent this year and 3.2 percent next year,
leading the G-7 nations.
</P>
<P>
Its unemployment rate, at 9.5 percent in May, will ease to 9.4
this year and 9.0 next year, with the addition of 300,000 jobs.
</P>
<P>
Alberta is forecast to be the top performer among Canada's
provincial economies this year, followed closely by Ontario and
Manitoba.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Senate Rejects Unconditional Payment of UN Debt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 17 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Senate today
overwhelmingly rejected an unconditional proposal to pay all its
United Nations arrears.
</P>
<P>
The proposal was raised by Senator Richard Lugar, who insists
that U.S. support for the world body is vital to U.S. interests
and the future of the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
Lugar's unconditional proposal was defeated by a vote of 73-25
and the Senate is prepared to vote on a plan accepted by the
Clinton administration to tie payments to U.N. reforms.
</P>
<P>
"It makes no sense to deny our allies funds that we owe to them
and expect that they are going to be generous in negotiating
settlements with us in a whole host of agreements around the
globe," said Lugar.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. administration today accepted the basic elements of a
plan worked out with Chairman Jesse Helms of the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee to pay 819 million U.S. dollars over three
years, with a demand of reducing U.S. dues and other U.N. reforms.
</P>
<P>
However, the administration said it strongly opposes some
provisions of the bill.
</P>
<P>
Senator Joseph Biden, a ranking democrat in the committee, said
that "ideally, we should not have to add such conditions" on
paying the overdue U.N. dues.
