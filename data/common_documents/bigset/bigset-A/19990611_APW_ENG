<HEADLINE> Irvine Leads Formula One Practice </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MONTREAL (AP) -- Even with a final lap miscue, Eddie Irvine still  
beat out Ferrari teammate Michael Schumacher on Friday and led both 
practice sessions for the Canadian Grand Prix. 
</P>
<P>
	``I only made one mistake and I was pleased with myself until  
then,'' Irvine said, referring to a harmless spin in the afternoon 
session. ``My last lap should have been my best, but I used too 
much of the curb at one point.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Irishman got around the 2.747-mile, 13-turn Circuit Gilles  
Villeneuve in 1 minute, 20.576 seconds. That was .700-second 
quicker than the 1:20.664 by McLaren-Mercedes driver David 
Coulthard of Scotland -- last year's Canadian pole-winner -- and 
.934-second faster than Schumacher's 1:21.276. 
</P>
<P>
	Schumacher, the defending race winner, was very confident after  
Friday's action. 
</P>
<P>
	``Tomorrow we will use our new engine for the first time in  
qualifying,'' the German said. ``I expect we will be very 
competitive in qualifying and in the race, as this circuit suits 
our car.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jean Alesi, the 1995 Canada winner, was fourth overall at  
1:21.510 in a Sauber-Petronas, followed by Giancarlo Fisichella's 
Benetton-Playlife at 1:21.724. 
</P>
<P>
	Riccardo Zonta, a 23-year-old Brazilian, made an impressive  
return to action following a three-race layoff while recuperating 
from a broken foot. The youngster put his British American Racing 
entry sixth at 1:21.810, beating out defending Formula One champion 
Mika Hakkinen, who struggled to a 1:21.950 in the other Team 
McLaren entry. 
</P>
<P>
	Hakkinen, who trails Schumacher by six points in the battle for  
the 1999 series title, does not enjoy racing on the Canadian 
circuit. 
</P>
<P>
	``This track is just weird,'' the Finnish driver said. ``I've  
never got it right, to be honest. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a challenge. If I get it right, I'll be very  
pleased.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even further off pace than Hakkinen was Team Williams driver  
Alex Zanardi, the CART champion each of the past two years. 
</P>
<P>
	Zanardi, who was an immediate starter when he joined the  
American-based series in 1996, has struggled badly so far in his 
less-than-triumphant return to Formula One. 
</P>
<P>
	In Friday's practice, Zanardi was 18th at 1:23.824.  
</P>
<P>
	``I certainly miss the competitiveness of the car I had  
underneath me last year (in CART),'' the Italian driver said. 
``But, having said that, the Winfield-Williams team is a great 
organization and nobody on the team is happy with the performance 
of the car right now. 
</P>
<P>
	``I still have something to learn about driving the car on these  
grooved tires, which is the feature that has changed the handling 
of the cars most dramatically since I was last in F1 (in 1994).'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jacques Villeneuve, another former CART champion and Zonta's BAR  
teammate, was ninth at 1:22.021 -- a performance the Canadian-born 
local favorite considered mediocre. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're finding some things out to make the car better, but it's  
very difficult,'' Villeneuve said. ''

<HEADLINE> Fed Gives Wall Street Jitters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The stock market has been a little off-kilter  
ever since the Federal Reserve first warned it might raise interest 
rates in an effort to cool down the U.S. economy. 
</P>
<P>
	This past week, however, stocks just plunged. The Dow Jones  
industrial average, after gaining 109 points on Monday, lost 418.87 
points over the next four sessions. Broader market indicators also 
fell, although their losses didn't approach those of the blue 
chips. 
</P>
<P>
	The vague nervousness that had been causing market indexes to  
bob in a narrow range since the Fed's May 18 warning was replaced 
by one specific threat to the value of stocks: a 30-year Treasury 
bond yield that pierced 6 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Stock prices tend to fall when interest rates go up. Higher  
rates mean higher corporate borrowing costs, cutting into profits, 
and they can also prompt consumers to cut back their spending. 
</P>
<P>
	But as rates climb, they might also draw investors away from the  
volatile price swings of stocks and toward the more stable, 
guaranteed returns that come with bonds. The higher their yield, 
the more favorable bonds appear. And analysts say 6 percent is a 
true, albeit largely psychological, benchmark. 
</P>
<P>
	``The penetration of that 6 percent level is sacrosanct to some  
investors,'' said Ned Riley, chief investment officer at 
BankBoston. 
</P>
<P>
	Why 6 percent? Investors love a round number. Just as market  
watchers have eagerly awaited each new 1,000-point milestone of the 
Dow, awarding special significance to 10,000, a bond yield of 6 
percent turns heads. 
</P>
<P>
	Just last October, the 30-year bond yield hit 5 percent as the  
Fed cut interest rates, hoping to save the global economy from a 
widespread currency crisis that decimated Asian markets and 
threatened U.S. financial markets. That, too, was dubbed a 
psychological barrier. 
</P>
<P>
	The current climate could be a boon for bond buyers, said Don  
Hays, chief investment strategist at Wheat First Union. 
</P>
<P>
	``We think that the recent rise in long-bond (30-year) yields is  
giving investors an outstanding opportunity to nail down very 
attractive yields -- with very low risk,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Risk is a crucial factor to investors weighing whether to put  
their money in stocks or bonds. Volatility anywhere in the economy, 
whether measured by political change, shifting economic policy, or 
major corporate news, can sway a stock investor toward more 
conservative investments like bonds. 
</P>
<P>
	``As short-term interest rates rise, you're getting paid a  
little more to be cautious,'' said David Orr, chief economist at 
First Union Capital Markets Group in Charlotte, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
	Orr said higher bond yields can appear especially alluring to  
investors in growth stocks, which include the pricey, often 
volatile technology companies. Those investments become less 
appealing once increased interest rates start chipping away at 
earnings. 
</P>
<P>
	But some analysts say the current investment climate has room  
for both stocks and bonds. 
</P>
<P>
	``I see 6 percent bonds as no impediment to future rising prices  
of stocks,'' said Joseph V. Battipaglia, chief investment 
strategist at Gruntal &AMP; Co. Battipaglia said that if second-quarter 
earnings are as strong as anticipated, the equities market will 
bear up regardless of the Fed's decision on interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
	``You could make a case that stocks will go nowhere,'' agreed  
David M. Jones, chief economist at Aubrey G. Lanston &AMP; Co., a 
government bond dealer. ``Higher and more attractive interest rates 
are holding stocks down, but good profits could pull them right 
back up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Friday's trading, the Dow fell 130.76 to close at 10,490.51,  
finishing down 309.33 points for the week. 
</P>
<P>
	The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 composite fell 9.18 to 1,293.64, and  
finished down 34.11 for the week. The Nasdaq composite declined 
36.74 to 2,447.88 Friday, losing 30.46 for the week. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index fell 3.35 to 619.50 Friday, losing  
15.02 for the week. The American Stock Exchange composite index 
fell 2.43 to 765.82 Friday, and was down 15.16 for the week. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 4.26 to 438.01  
Friday, and was down 4.32 for the week. 
</P>
<P>
	The Wilshire Associates Equity Index, which represents the  
combined market value of all NYSE, American and Nasdaq issues, 
ended the week at $11.9 trillion, off $297.076 billion from the 
previous week. A year ago the index was $10.3 trillion.

<HEADLINE> Lakers Discuss Opening With Jackson </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The Los Angeles Lakers, who haven't won an  
NBA championship since 1988, are speaking with Phil Jackson about 
their vacant coaching job. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson guided the Chicago Bulls to six NBA titles in his nine  
years as their coach. He left following last season, after the 
Michael Jordan-led Bulls won their sixth and final title, and 
didn't coach this season. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bulls were 545-193 under Jackson.  
</P>
<P>
	``We're not going to deny the fact that we've talked to Phil  
Jackson about coaching the Lakers next season,'' Jerry West, the 
team's executive vice president for basketball operations, said in 
a statement issued Friday. ``With the success he's had in the NBA, 
he's definitely an attractive candidate. 
</P>
<P>
	``However, we're exploring several possibilities with different  
individuals and no decision has been made yet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fox Sports News reported late Thursday that the Lakers offered  
Jackson, 53, a four-year deal worth more than $20 million. However, 
while admitting there was interest, West told the Los Angeles Times 
no offer had been made, and ``it would be wrong to presume a deal 
was near.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking after the WNBA's Los Angeles Sparks played their  
season-opener Thursday night at the Forum, Lakers owner Jerry Buss 
said he would neither confirm nor deny the report. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been out of town,'' Buss said. ``I've got to talk to  
Jerry West. We'll see.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson's Chicago-based agent, Todd Musburger, was reported by  
Fox Sports News to be in ``serious negotiations'' with the Lakers. 
</P>
<P>
	Musburger wouldn't comment when contacted by the Times, and  
didn't immediately return a telephone call Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Showtime Lakers of the 1980s won five championships, but  
haven't reached the NBA Finals since 1991, when they lost to 
Jackson and the Bulls in five games, beginning Chicago's run of six 
titles in a span of eight seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	The Shaquille O'Neal-led Lakers reached the Western Conference  
finals last spring before being swept by the Utah Jazz. This year's 
Lakers were swept by Western Conference champion San Antonio in a 
second-round playoff series to complete their chaotic 
lockout-shortened season. 
</P>
<P>
	Many viewed the Lakers as the logical successor to the Bulls  
after Jackson left, Jordan retired and other key players were 
either traded away or signed contracts with other teams. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Del Harris was fired as coach of the Lakers after the  
team lost three road games in as many days in February to fall to 
6-6, and former Bulls rebounding star Dennis Rodman played his 
first game with the team on Feb. 26 -- the same day 41-year-old Kurt 
Rambis was hired to succeed Harris on an interim basis. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lakers won their first nine games with Rambis as coach, but  
Rodman took a leave of absence at that point, and the remainder of 
the season was a jumble of controversy. 
</P>
<P>
	Rodman, who thrived under Jackson in Chicago, was finally waived  
April 16. 
</P>
<P>
	Rambis, under contract as coach through the end of the current  
season, said the day after the Lakers' lost their fourth and final 
game to the Spurs that he expected to be back next year. 
</P>
<P>
	It appeared that would be the likely scenario until the last few  
days. 
</P>
<P>
	West told the Times late Thursday the Lakers had ``talked about  
a lot of different parameters to a couple different people,'' 
adding the team has had similar discussions with Rambis. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's going to be a lot of speculation out there,'' West  
added. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson was reportedly on vacation in Alaska, and unavailable  
for comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Several other teams, including the New York Knicks and New  
Jersey Nets, also are reportedly interested in hiring Jackson, who 
played for the Knicks from 1967-78, and for the Nets in 1979-80.

<HEADLINE> Salt Lake Olympics Gives Raises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Struggling to raise money and cutting  
frills, the Salt Lake Organizing Committee nonetheless has money 
for 3 percent pay raises to 237 employees and officers. 
</P>
<P>
	The Olympic scandal has set back fund raising, with  
belt-tightening governing just about everything in SLOC. 
</P>
<P>
	But officials relented on pay raises because to forego them  
``would be so fundamentally horrible,'' said Ed Eynon, senior vice 
president of human resources. 
</P>
<P>
	A hiring freeze has kept SLOC from adding another 77 staffers by  
now, three years before the 2002 Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	``You're working your people harder, and they've gone through a  
very tough time,'' Eynon said. ``Obviously, they'd like more (of a 
raise) but they understand.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last year's raises were 4.5 percent. This year's 3 percent will  
go to regular employees based on merit after job evaluations this 
month. Nine SLOC officers were offered the same raise by SLOC's 
management committee Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	SLOC president Mitt Romney is drawing no salary pending the  
games' completion under budget, and chief operating officer Fraser 
Bullock is turning away the raise. 
</P>
<P>
	Bullock, hired in April as Romney's right-hand man, is paid  
nearly $200,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
	Romney says he'll retroactively accept predecessor Frank  
Joklik's $280,000 salary if the Games are a financial success. 
</P>
<P>
	Five other senior vice presidents are taking the raise: Eynon;  
Shelley Thomas for public communications; Grant Thomas, venues; 
Bill Wagner, operations, and Kelly Flint, legal and marketing. 
</P>
<P>
	Vice presidents Cindy Gillespie of federal relations and Mark  
Lewis of marketing and licenses also are accepting raises. Two 
other managers getting raises were not identified.

<HEADLINE> Stanford Baseball Coach Likes Team </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OMAHA, Neb. (AP) -- Stanford coach Mark Marquess has led teams to  
two NCAA titles and an Olympic gold medal. And he likes the look of 
his Cardinal entering this year's College World Series. 
</P>
<P>
	``They think they're good, and that's half the battle,''  
Marquess said before sixth-seeded Stanford (48-13) game against No. 
3 Cal State-Fullerton (49-12) Saturday in the CWS opener for both 
teams. 
</P>
<P>
	In the earlier game, second-seeded Florida State (53-12) meets  
No. 7 Texas A&AMP;M (52-16). 
</P>
<P>
	Stanford, which won NCAA championships in 1987 and 1988, is  
making its 11th CWS appearance. It's the 23rd season at Stanford 
for Marquess, who coached the United States to the gold medal at 
the 1988 Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cardinal have traditionally had strong pitching. For  
example, Jack McDowell (1985-87) and Mike Mussina (1988-90) pitched 
for Marquess, who credited pitching for taking Stanford to Omaha 
again this season. 
</P>
<P>
	The Stanford staff set a single-season school record with 574  
strikeouts, 12 short of the Pac-10 record. Sophomore right-hander 
Jason Young (11-3, 3.14 ERA), who will start against the Titans, 
had a school-record 161 strikeouts. 
</P>
<P>
	Marquess also got strong efforts from sophomore right-hander  
Justin Wayne (9-1, 4.92, 131 Ks) and freshman right-hander Brian 
Sager (6-0, 3.98, 70 Ks). 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought we were at least a year or two away (from Omaha),''  
Marquess said. ``We basically had to pitch our entire season with 
freshmen and sophomores.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fullerton beat Stanford 8-0 to start the season, then lost the  
next two to the Cardinal and another at Pepperdine. Coach George 
Horton said he wasn't sure what kind of team he had during its 
early-season struggles. 
</P>
<P>
	When Fullerton went unbeaten in 15 games during March, Horton  
knew he had a good team. The Titans really came together last 
weekend, winning at Ohio State to capture the super regional. They 
played without four starters who were suspended for throwing rocks 
during the regional a week earlier at South Bend, Ind. 
</P>
<P>
	Second baseman David Vacani and shortstop Chad Olszanski and  
pitchers Adam Johnson and Marco Hanlon will play at Omaha. Johnson 
(10-3, 3.22) will start against Stanford. 
</P>
<P>
	``They've served their penalty,'' Horton said. ``That's behind  
us and we're glad to have them back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Florida State is making its 17th trip to the CWS but the  
Seminoles are still searching for their first title. Coach Mike 
Martin has been criticized for over-managing his previous teams. 
This year, he pulled back and let the team play. 
</P>
<P>
	What resulted was a season of highs and lows, from second  
baseman Marshall McDougall's six home runs in a victory last month 
at Maryland to a five-game losing streak at the end of April. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our season has been punctuated by streaks,'' Martin said.  
``The highs are when you play Miami in a packed house and win 8-2. 
The humilities are when you lose the next five. We accomplished 
that with ease.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Then there was the celebration after the Seminoles won their  
super regional to advance to Omaha. Three players were hurt in the 
pileup, including sophomore right-hander Nick Stocks (12-2, 3.09, 
130 Ks), who will start against A&AMP;M. 
</P>
<P>
	The Aggies hit 127 home runs to set a school record. Outfielder  
Daylan Holt led the nation with 34 homers, another school record, 
while hitting .339 with 105 RBIs. That power almost worked against 
A&AMP;M in the NCAA tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	``We proceeded to do it the hard way in the regionals,'' said  
Aggies coach Mark Johnson, whose team came through the loser's 
bracket to win its regional, then lost a game to Clemson in the 
super regional. 
</P>
<P>
	``We center our team around home runs, which no coach likes to  
do. Good pitching has a tendency to beat us, but we've beat some 
good pitchers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Left-hander Casey Fossum (12-6, 3.35, 158 Ks) will start for the  
Aggies.

<HEADLINE> Steel Cos. Face Last Tariff Hurdle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- U.S. steel producers struggling from last  
year's surge in low-priced imports are looking beyond a crucial 
International Trade Commission ruling for an end to their plight. 
</P>
<P>
	The ITC was voting today on U.S. tariffs against Japan on  
hot-rolled carbon steel, the industry's leading product. If 
approved, the Clinton administration would order tariffs of as much 
as 67 percent within weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	But hot-rolled shipments from Japan already have declined,  
partly because of the threat of tariffs, which make imports more 
expensive. Today's ruling would not apply to other steel products 
or to other countries. 
</P>
<P>
	``Certainly a ruling (for tariffs) would have a positive impact,  
but the key here is that this situation has not ended,'' said 
William Klinefelter, Washington representative of the United 
Steelworkers of America union. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. industry has been pushing for stronger sanctions, such  
as quotas covering all steel products from all countries, to help 
combat imports that it blames for thousands of layoffs and 
bankruptcies at three U.S. companies. 
</P>
<P>
	Supporters are hoping for a Senate vote on quotas later this  
month. The House passed the measure in March by a 289-141 vote, 
despite the threat of a presidential veto. 
</P>
<P>
	The question before the commission was whether domestic industry  
is hurt by Japanese pricing practices already deemed illegal by the 
Commerce Department. Tariffs would be imposed if the commission 
finds actual or threatened injury. 
</P>
<P>
	Rejection of tariffs could prompt imports to rise and could  
encourage more shipments from other countries that had been looking 
for signs of what practices are permissible. A rejection also could 
boost support in Congress for global quotas. 
</P>
<P>
	Masaki Sato, president and chief executive for Nippon Steel  
U.S.A. Inc., said any attempt to restrict imports would be 
``unjustified, ill-conceived and counterproductive'' and would hurt 
U.S. steel consumers as well as Japanese producers. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. industry accused Japanese, Russian and Brazilian  
producers of illegally dumping hot-rolled steel in the United 
States at prices below production costs or home-market prices. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration has tentatively struck deals with  
Russia and Brazil in which those countries could avoid tariffs by 
voluntarily reducing steel shipments. That leaves Japan as the 
remaining target, and the Commerce Department concurred with the 
industry's charges against Japan in April. 
</P>
<P>
	The foreign producers argued that the pricing trends result from  
normal market forces, including a General Motors strike that 
lowered demand for steel in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	They also said the U.S. industry's claims of harm were  
exaggerated because any decline last year followed one of the 
industry's best years ever. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration has faced difficult choices about how  
exactly to respond to complaints from U.S. steel companies and 
workers' unions. The administration has preferred to let the trade 
complaints run their course and has been encouraged by signs of 
import reductions since November. 
</P>
<P>
	Hot-rolled shipments from Japan went down 98 percent to 7,428  
metric tons in April, compared with 405,974 in November. Although 
Japan was a leading source of imports before the U.S. industry 
filed trade complaints in September, the country accounted for less 
than 2 percent of all foreign hot-rolled steel in April.

<HEADLINE> Police Bust Int'l. Call Girl Ring </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Police have busted what they say is one of  
the biggest call girl rings since the Heidi Fleiss case, arresting 
an alleged madam whose clients were said to include Hollywood 
figures, Fortune 500 CEOs and at least one pro athlete. 
</P>
<P>
	Jody Diane ``Babydol'' Gibson, 41, was arrested for  
investigation of pandering Wednesday at a Westside hotel, where she 
had gone to meet someone who turned out to be an undercover 
officer. 
</P>
<P>
	The arrest came after a 10-month investigation that began when a  
disgruntled employee told police she hadn't been paid, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Gibson was released on $25,000 bail. Additional pandering  
charges are expected. Each carries a mandatory three-year sentence. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Gibson and about 30 employees serviced more than 100 men in  
this country and overseas, charging $500 to $3,000, Lt. Mike Felix, 
acting director of the vice unit, said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Gibson kept detailed notes on clients, but police aren't  
releasing any of the names. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are names that people would recognize as possibly being  
some of Heidi's clients,'' Felix said. ``There are people in the 
entertainment industry involved. Actors, a professional athlete, 
CEOs of Fortune 500 companies.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He added: ``Some of these businesses ought to be checking the  
expense reports of their executives.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Gibson allegedly ran her business from a dilapidated house  
in the tiny town of Palo Verde, near the Arizona state line. 
</P>
<P>
	Most business was conducted through the mail, though she also  
used a Web site called ``caldreamin,'' which advertised itself as a 
modeling agency and featured photos of semi-nude women, police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clients were accepted by referral only, Felix said. After  
selecting a woman from the Internet site, men would be given a 
number to call to make arrangements. 
</P>
<P>
	At Ms. Gibson's house, investigators found lists with the names  
of about 30 female employees and clients, Felix said. 
</P>
<P>
	According to Ms. Gibson's records, Felix said, Fleiss once  
approached the woman for a job but was turned down. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said they did not know if Ms. Gibson had an attorney. Her  
telephone number is not listed.

<HEADLINE> Energy Futures Rise; Pork Up Too  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Energy futures rose sharply Friday on the New York Mercantile  
Exchange amid the possibility of an oil workers' strike in 
Venezuela that could hobble the flow of oil to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	On other markets, orange juice futures tumbled, while pork  
futures advanced. 
</P>
<P>
	Crude jumped as two key unions moved closer to a strike deadline  
in Venezuela, which exports about 60 percent of its oil to the 
United States and competes with Saudi Arabia for sales. 
</P>
<P>
	Oil workers are pressing their demand that the state-owned oil  
company rescind a decision to freeze wages for 33,000 workers 
nationwide and say they will walk off the job Monday unless that 
occurs. 
</P>
<P>
	Crude also found support after the International Energy Agency  
suggested world demand for oil from the Organization of the 
Petroleum Exporting Countries was on the rise after months in which 
economic downturns in Asia, Russia and Latin America dulled demand. 
</P>
<P>
	Crude products gasoline and heating oil also were supported by  
unconfirmed market rumors that BP Amoco had made additional cuts in 
refinery processing at plants in Illinois and Indiana because the 
cost of making those products is not profitable enough, given the 
relatively high cost of purchasing crude. 
</P>
<P>
	Light, sweet crude for July delivery rose 58 cents to $18.43 a  
barrel; July unleaded gasoline rose 1.67 cents to 53.20 cents a 
gallon; July heating oil rose 2.10 cents to 44.84 cents a gallon; 
July natural gas rose 2.3 cents to $2.375 for each 1,000 cubic 
feet. 
</P>
<P>
	Frozen, concentrated orange juice futures tumbled on the Board  
of Trade of the City of the New York after the government's 
production estimate for Florida's orange crop posted a smaller 
decline than expected. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Department of Agriculture lowered its estimate of  
Florida's orange crop by 500,000 boxes from last month to 187.5 
million boxes, each weighing 90 pounds. But investors were 
expecting the agency to lower the estimate by 1 million to 2 
million boxes amid expectations severe weather had damaged more of 
the crop than originally thought. 
</P>
<P>
	July frozen concentrated orange juice fell 2.55 cents to 90.70  
cents a pound. 
</P>
<P>
	Hog futures finished the day mostly higher on the Chicago  
Mercantile Exchange amid news that retailers plan to feature pork 
next week. 
</P>
<P>
	August live cattle rose .62 cent to 65.02 cents a pound; August  
feeder cattle rose .63 cent to 77.95 cents a pound; July lean hogs 
rose .58 cent to 53.95 cents a pound; July pork bellies fell .45 
cent to 47.17 cents a pound.

<HEADLINE> Japan Moves To Create 700,000 Jobs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japan will try to tackle record unemployment,  
foster business growth and beef up its competitiveness by creating 
more than 700,000 jobs, the government announced Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We must allay people's worries about job security and put our  
nation's economy on track to self-sustained growth,'' Prime 
Minister Keizo Obuchi said in announcing the program. 
</P>
<P>
	Unemployment is at an all-time high of 4.8 percent -- about 3.4  
million people -- and government officials are worried that it may 
rise even higher. 
</P>
<P>
	Nearly half of the new jobs will be in the government sector,  
including a two-year program to boost hiring of part-time language 
teachers at public schools. The package also promises subsidies to 
companies in growing industries, such as telecommunications, 
ecology and biotechnology, to encourage hiring. 
</P>
<P>
	Obuchi said he hopes to get a supplementary budget passed as  
soon as possible to fund the program. The Japanese media has 
speculated that he will request $4.2 billion, a figure deemed 
likely by Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa. 
</P>
<P>
	While business leaders praised the package, analysts expressed  
doubts over how effective the program could be. 
</P>
<P>
	The main problem is that boosting competitiveness and saving  
jobs are contradictory, said Andrew Shipley, an economist with 
Schroders Japan in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you want to protect jobs, you have to sacrifice  
productivity and wage growth. What the Obuchi administration is 
trying to do is have its cake and eat it, too,'' Shipley said. ``He 
is trying to generate the benefits of a restructuring and 
market-oriented policy without enduring any of the pain.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Akitaka Saiki, the prime minister's spokesman, acknowledged that  
social welfare was a major part of the jobs program at a time when 
the old system of lifetime employment -- in which workers could 
expect to be employed at the same company for their entire career -- 
is quickly eroding. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a painful phenomenon for most workers,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	The program offers a way to help adjust, Saiki said, by offering  
job-training for mid-career workers and opening up new job 
opportunities for business executives, such as language 
instruction. 
</P>
<P>
	The package also seeks to make it easier for small and  
medium-sized businesses to reconstruct and declare bankruptcy, and 
is intended to help companies to shift stock holdings and sell off 
parts of their operations. Such measures will require the passage 
of bills in Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
	Hiroshi Okuda, chairman of Toyota Motor Corp. who heads an  
influential business group called Nikkeiren, called it ``timely.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``From now on, we in the private sector must work toward  
increasing our own competitiveness and creating jobs,'' Okuda said. 
</P>
<P>
	News of the plan comes a day after the Obuchi administration  
released figures showing an unexpectedly strong 1.9 percent 
economic growth rate for the first three months of this year -- the 
first sign of growth since the summer of 1997. But that growth 
largely reflects massive public works spending.

<HEADLINE> NASCAR's Petty Denies Move to IRL </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BROOKLYN, Mich. (AP) -- Kyle Petty says there's no truth to a  
rumor that he might drive in a future Indy Racing League event. 
</P>
<P>
	The speculation grew when Petty was offered the opportunity to  
drive a few laps in an IRL car Tuesday at Atlanta Motor Speedway. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've never discussed running an Indy race with anybody at  
Atlanta, or any other races this season,'' Petty said Friday. 
``It's not that I don't think it wouldn't be fun. There just isn't 
time for it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Petty said Terry Linger, part owner of Panther Racing, asked him  
if he would like to drive a few laps in the IRL car while the team 
was testing in Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was going to do a few laps for fun, see what it was like,  
tell them thanks and head home,'' Petty said. ``It was just a fun 
deal. 
</P>
<P>
	``My racing plans are focused entirely on Petty Enterprises and  
what we're doing there.''

	``Two of my favorite things are my steering wheel and my

race-car transporters can make a difference in children's lives. 
</P>
<P>
	Throughout the 1999 NASCAR season, Geissman, driver of the  
transporter for Johnny Benson's car, has been corresponding with a 
third- and fourth-grade resource room class at Milo A. Brown 
Elementary School in nearby Byron Center. Thursday, he drove the 
transporter to the school for a visit. 
</P>
<P>
	Teacher David Dunn contacted Roush Racing in hopes of finding  
someone to help motivate his students to learn and believe in 
themselves. As a result, Geissman now drives the transporter by day 
around the country and at night reads the letters he receives from 
the students. Geissman also takes the time to respond to each 
student individually. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought it would be special if I sat down and wrote each kid  
a full-page letter,'' Geissman said. ``It is time-consuming, but I 
think it's the better thing to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The letters Geissman sends also are used to teach the students  
math and geography.

<HEADLINE> A Kinder, Friendlier Toys R Us </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- When Jenny Wong thinks of the stores she detests  
to shop at the most, Toys R Us comes to mind. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hate shopping at a store where the sales help literally  
barks at you if you have a question or need help finding 
something,'' said the mother of two from New York. 
</P>
<P>
	While shoddy customer service is a problem at many of the  
nation's retailers, Paramus, N.J.-based Toys R Us has been cited as 
one of the worst offenders. 
</P>
<P>
	In an acknowledgment of its troubles, the company plans Sunday  
to launch its biggest customer service overhaul ever. The 
initiative, designed with the help of Walt Disney Co., is intended 
to rally Toys R Us' 52,000 U.S. employees to change how they treat 
customers. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can lose a customer very fast, but you can win them back  
and part of that comes with great service,'' said Toys R Us chief 
executive Robert Nakasone. ``It doesn't cost any more to smile or 
be polite to a customer, and there's a huge payoff if they come 
back to the store again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It's been a tough few years for Toys R Us, and its problems --  
including sluggish sales and profits -- have been linked in part to 
its service issues. Consumers complain of cramped aisles, confusing 
layouts and apathetic salespeople who seem unable to distinguish 
Barbie dolls from baseball bats. 
</P>
<P>
	``Toys R Us allowed its stores to get tired, it allowed its  
service to get tired and that can't happen in any kind of 
retailing, but especially toy retailing,'' said Leonard L. Barry, a 
professor of retailing at Texas A&AMP;M University and author of 
``Discovering the Soul of Service.'' ``Toy stores are supposed to 
be a happy experience and selling today to the customer should be 
fun.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Toys R Us is anything but fun, said Wendy Liebmann, president of  
the retail consulting firm WSL Strategic Retail. ``I've heard from 
parents and grandparents that they feel the overall experience has 
been miserable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stealing customers from Toys R Us are discount chains such as  
Wal-Mart and Target, which are selling toys for cheaper prices and 
doing it with friendlier and more attentive staffs. 
</P>
<P>
	Wal-Mart, which is famous for its ``greeters'' who welcome  
shoppers, dethroned Toys R Us as the nation's biggest toy retailer 
in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Now Toys R Us is fighting back.  
</P>
<P>
	In the last year, the company has started a major renovation of  
its 1,500 stores, developing a brighter, easier-to-navigate layout 
with more selling space. 
</P>
<P>
	The company has also added more products that kids today want --  
such as electronics, science and learning toys and beauty 
accessories. It has scaled back on toys that aren't popular anymore 
like board games. 
</P>
<P>
	Toys R Us is also stepping up its presence on the Internet, and  
later this month, is expected to unveil a new toysrus.com Web site 
that has better graphics and is easier to use. 
</P>
<P>
	But many analysts say the most crucial step in winning shoppers  
back is improving customer service. 
</P>
<P>
	Sunday night every Toys R Us employee in the country will  
participate in a three-hour presentation and cheerleading session. 
The program will highlight the importance of taking the initiative 
with customers and being courteous. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, employees will learn of changes planned in the  
coming year. One example: workers who never before got specialized 
training will be assigned a section of the store and taught about 
the toys there. 
</P>
<P>
	To symbolize the company's fresh start, workers will get new  
uniforms, a light denim shirt, with a new logo. 
</P>
<P>
	The program was designed with the help of the Disney Institute,  
which teaches other corporations how to implement the Magic 
Kingdom's customer service success. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want our employees to stop working off a task list and try  
to do anything possible to satisfy the customer,'' Nakasone said. 
``We'll know if the customer responds well, because it will show up 
in the sales, it will show up in the profits and it will show up in 
the stock price.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shoppers like Ms. Wong say the new program may entice her to  
give Toys R Us another chance. In the last year, she's been 
shopping at Kmart and smaller specialty toy stores. 
</P>
<P>
	``Let's see what happens next Christmas,'' she said. ``If they  
are nice then, I'll admit the program is working.''

<HEADLINE> Winter Wheat Harvest Off 14 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Farmers turned to more profitable crops and  
are expected to harvest 14 percent less winter wheat this year, but 
prices are likely to remain low unless the heavy rains this spring 
wind up damaging yields, analysts say. 
</P>
<P>
	The Agriculture Department on Friday predicted growers would  
harvest 1.6 billion bushels of winter wheat, down slightly from the 
May forecast and off 270 million bushels from a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest forecast was in line with what analysts expected. A  
steep decline in wheat prices last year spurred many farmers in 
Kansas, Oklahoma and Texas to sit out the winter and plant crops 
like sorghum and soybeans this spring. 
</P>
<P>
	``The acreage is down simply because of price and people are  
going to other crops to generate revenue,'' said Jack Eberspacher, 
chief executive officer of the National Association of Wheat 
Growers. 
</P>
<P>
	July wheat futures fell 4 1/4 cents Friday at Kansas City to close  
at $2.89 a bushel. USDA made no change in its price projections for 
wheat. 
</P>
<P>
	Also to no one's surprise, the nation's orange crop was forecast  
to be off 28 percent from last year's record of 13.7 million tons, 
because of extreme weather conditions last year when the fruit was 
developing. The forecast for Florida's production is down 23 
percent from a year ago, while California's is off by half. 
</P>
<P>
	Florida, the leading citrus state, is expected to harvest 8.4  
million tons of oranges this year, a reduction of less than 1 
percent from the May forecast. 
</P>
<P>
	USDA's next crop report in July will provide a better gauge of  
whether prices will rebound. Heavy rainfall has soaked the Plains 
in recent weeks from Kansas to North Dakota. The moisture could 
damage the winter wheat that hasn't been harvested as well as lead 
to disease in newly planted crops. 
</P>
<P>
	``As we head into harvest there could be some heavy yield,  
protein and quality losses,'' said Dick Loewy, a commodity analyst 
with AgResource Co. of Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	Winter wheat yields are up slightly nationwide, from 44.4  
bushels per acre to 44.7 bushels per acre. 
</P>
<P>
	Production in Kansas is expected to be down nearly 100 million  
bushels this year, to 395.6 million. Production in Oklahoma is off 
50 million bushels to 148.5 million.

<HEADLINE> America's Health Said To Improve </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- The nation's top doctor says Americans are taking  
better care of themselves, but children are more likely to be obese 
and suffer from asthma. 
</P>
<P>
	``Asthma has sort of caught us all by surprise,'' U.S. Surgeon  
General David Satcher said at Harvard Medical School's commencement 
on Thursday. ``We don't understand it, to tell you the truth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In 1996, there were 338 asthma hospitalizations for every  
100,000 children under the age of 14, an improvement since 1995, 
but significantly higher than the 284 hospitalizations observed in 
1987. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall, the health of Americans has improved in the decade  
since the government released its Healthy People 2000 goals -- a 
blueprint of more than 300 health objectives, from reducing smoking 
to increasing seat belt use. 
</P>
<P>
	Launched in 1979, the Healthy People initiative has been  
reformulated each decade to provide a yearly review of Americans' 
health progress. Six months shy of the 2000 goal, some target areas 
are on track or already have been reached, according to Satcher. 
</P>
<P>
	But some serious health problems continue to persist, most  
notably obesity, low-birthweight babies and childhood asthma, cases 
of which have almost tripled since 1980. 
</P>
<P>
	And there continue to be serious disparities in the health of  
whites vs. minority groups. Black children, for example, are three 
to four times as likely as whites to suffer complications from 
asthma, Satcher said. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 20 percent of children and more than half of Americans  
are considered overweight. Over 50 percent of Hispanic and black 
women are considered obese, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``These things going in the current direction means that we  
continue to load the population with people who are at greater 
risk'' of diabetes, heart disease, cancer and stroke, said Dr. 
Robert Fletcher, a professor of ambulatory care and prevention at 
Harvard. 
</P>
<P>
	The incidence of low birthweight babies increased from 6.9  
percent of all births in 1987 to 7.5 percent in 1997. But much of 
that may be due to the larger number of babies being kept alive due 
to improved medical technology, Satcher said. 
</P>
<P>
	Infant mortality has dropped throughout the 1990s, and the death  
rate for children ages 1 to 4 has declined by 26 percent, 
surpassing the government's objective, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Improving nutrition and physical activity alone -- the surgeon  
general recommends exercising 30 minutes five times a week -- could 
reduce cardiovascular illness and deaths by 50 percent, and 
colorectal cancer rates by at least 40 percent, Satcher said. 
</P>
<P>
	In encouraging news, 15 percent of the Healthy People objectives  
have been reached, including areas of nutrition, maternal and child 
health, heart disease, breast cancer and mental health. 
</P>
<P>
	Another 44 percent of the objectives are heading toward the  
target, including child immunizations, mammography screenings and 
consumption of five fruits and vegetables a day.

<HEADLINE> Rather Book: Columns Between Covers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- If CBS News were a newspaper, Dan Rather's  
byline would be found on just about every page: 
</P>
<P>
	--Rather anchors the ``48 Hours'' newsmagazine.  
</P>
<P>
	--He serves as a correspondent for the new ``60 Minutes II'' and  
as a contributor to its forebear, ``60 Minutes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	--His name nests in the title of ``The CBS Evening News With Dan  
Rather.'' He does a daily radio commentary. And when the big story 
breaks, he's apt to be reporting from the thick of it. 
</P>
<P>
	If all this were a newspaper, it might properly be called The  
Daily Dan. 
</P>
<P>
	But it isn't a newspaper, it's broadcasting, and that suits  
Rather fine. Except for one thing: There's no ink involved. 
</P>
<P>
	Looking to fix that, Rather added ink to his regimen in June  
1997, when he began writing a weekly column. Syndicated by King 
Features, ``Dan Rather Reporting'' appears in newspapers 
nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
	Now Rather has gathered some of those columns, along with other  
writings, into a volume titled ``Deadlines and Datelines: Essays at 
the Turn of the Century,'' published by William Morrow. 
</P>
<P>
	In its pages, Rather speaks of people and things as diverse as  
Saddam Hussein and Debbie Reynolds; poor service from a Manhattan 
photo shop and heroic service in the rattletrap Mir space station. 
The pieces are crisply composed, a bit folksy and unfailingly 
gracious, even in reproach. It's very much Rather's voice, in ink. 
</P>
<P>
	Here we read of Rather looking, through tears, upon the broken  
body of one survivor of the Oklahoma City bombing after Timothy 
McVeigh is found guilty on all counts. The verdict marks ``the end 
of one chapter, but not the end of the whole story. 
</P>
<P>
	``Justice is like that,'' Rather reflects. ``It's meant to bring  
closure, to answer questions, to put limits on our suffering, to 
stop the wrongdoing. The reality is often more complicated than 
that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	We also read of Rather's wife Jean, who, as a girl, met up with  
a certain good-looking kid, a raven-haired truck driver passing 
through town. 
</P>
<P>
	``And ever since that dance, at the VFW post in Winchester,  
Texas, on a warm summer night many, many years ago, Jeannie has 
been an Elvis Presley fan,'' Rather writes. For the boy at the 
dance, who, ``a few months later, gave up truck-driving for a 
career in music,'' was Elvis himself. 
</P>
<P>
	``Wide variety. Easy to read. Mercifully short,'' says Rather in  
his office, jauntily reciting a few of his new book's selling 
points. ``And I'm supposed to tell you that this is the perfect 
Father's Day gift.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But if at that moment he's kidding around, the author of such  
books as ``The Camera Never Blinks Twice'' and ``The Palace Guard'' 
leaves no doubt he is thrilled to be between covers again -- 
especially since ``Deadlines and Datelines'' certifies for the ages 
that Rather, in addition to the CBS gig, took his turn writing a 
column. 
</P>
<P>
	``Seeing something in a newspaper with my byline on it reaches  
way back with me,'' he says. Back to Depression-era Texas when a 
little boy's dream ``was to become a big byline reporter for the 
Houston Chronicle or the Houston Post or the Houston Press. And 
dreams die hard. Sometimes, they never die.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After college and the Marines, Rather headed for the Chronicle.  
</P>
<P>
	``I wasn't particularly good at it,'' he admits. ``For one  
thing, I was an atrocious speller. But somebody had mercy on me, 
and while never saying to me, `Son, I'm not sure you're going to 
make it as a newspaperman,' they pointed me to the newspaper's 
radio station.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The broadcasting thing worked out pretty well for Rather in the  
decades to come. But when he was approached to write a syndicated 
column, he couldn't say no. 
</P>
<P>
	An unrequited urge can be persuasive. But didn't he already have  
enough to do? 
</P>
<P>
	``Well, when you're an anchor for a big television network, a  
lot of life is easy,'' Rather explains. ``Not everything: You're up 
there for everybody to shoot at. But a lot of things are really 
easy. And when you sit down to the blank computer screen, there is 
nothing easy about it. I like that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On the jacket of his new book, Rather is pictured with his  
``Front Page''-vintage Royal manual typewriter. It resides on his 
office desk, though largely as a monument to past stories it helped 
him channel into print. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, Rather does his writing on a word processor.  
</P>
<P>
	And yet ... he also keeps a portable typewriter at home, he  
confides. There was a time when he would tote it along for writing 
on planes. 
</P>
<P>
	As recently as January.  
</P>
<P>
	``Flying back from Texas, I had an idea for a column and I was  
going to bang it out,'' he says. But he didn't get much work done. 
``One person said, 'It's been a long time since I saw one of 
those!' Another person brought their child over and said, 'This is 
what they had before computers.' And somebody else complained about 
the noise.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rather got it. ``I have a new portable computer now,'' he says.  
And, like him, it's primed for the next column, for the next book. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Stars' Star Modano Injures Wrist </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) -- The Dallas Stars' strategy of becoming much  
more physical with the Buffalo Sabres came at a potentially huge 
price: The possible loss of leading scorer Mike Modano with a wrist 
injury. 
</P>
<P>
	Modano, a holdover from the Stars' 1991 Stanley Cup team and  
their top regular-season scorer, injured his left wrist during a 
third-period collision with defenseman Jay McKee in Dallas' 4-2 
victory Thursday in Game 2. 
</P>
<P>
	Stars coach Ken Hitchcock was vague Friday, saying only that  
Modano's wrist was ``jammed'' but refusing to say if the wrist was 
fractured. NHL spokesman Frank Brown said the Stars aren't required 
under league rules to disclose the exact nature of the injury. 
</P>
<P>
	NHL coaches traditionally are vague about injuries during the  
Stanley Cup playoffs because they fear opponents will gain a 
strategic advantage if they know in advance who will -- or won't -- 
play. 
</P>
<P>
	Modano is wearing a bowler's-like protective device on the  
wrist, but Hitchcock did not rule his first-line center out of 
Saturday night's Game 3 at Marine Midland Arena. But he also hinted 
strongly he won't play, and several Stars talked as if they don't 
expect Modano back soon. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the worst-case scenario, he's out 7-10 days,'' Hitchcock  
said. ``We'll see how it feels. It felt a lot better today than we 
all thought it would.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But, he cautioned, ``Mike has to be 100 percent in his mind and  
his body to be playing. He's going to have to protect himself. He 
can't go out there and worry about Michael Pecas or Dixon Wards 
running after him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Peca, the Sabres' center, warned that might happen should Modano  
play. 
</P>
<P>
	``If he is in the lineup we're going to make it a point to be  
very physical with him and make it miserable for him,'' Peca said. 
``If a guy's got a broken wrist, you wouldn't wind up and take a 
two-hander but try to get in his way and bump him as much as you 
can. If there's a weakness you want to exploit that weakness.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If there's a weakness, Modano is hiding it. He entered the  
Stars' hotel in Great Valley, N.Y., near Buffalo on Friday 
afternoon wearing a sports jacket draped strategically across his 
left arm. 
</P>
<P>
	Should Modano make an unexpectedly fast recovery and the Sabres  
try to go after his injured wrist, Hitchcock said, ``He's our best 
player. If they go after our best player, we'll go after their 
best, and that's Dominik Hasek.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Stars already tried that with some success in Game 2,  
knocking the Buffalo goaltender down three times in the first 
period and frequently stationing a player in front of the net to 
screen him from shots. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, losing Modano, the center who anchors the Stars' top line  
of Brett Hull and Jere Lehtinen, would be a big blow to Dallas, 
especially with three of the next four games in Buffalo. The Sabres 
are 7-0 in the playoffs at home. 
</P>
<P>
	Modano assisted on both Stars' goals in Buffalo's 3-2 overtime  
victory in Game 1 and has five multiple-point games during Dallas' 
playoff run. He has five goals and 13 assists for 18 points, one 
fewer than Joe Nieuwendyk. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sure, he's a big part of the team,'' center Guy Carbonneau  
said. ``I mean, losing Mo now is going to affect us. It has to. But 
we can overcome it. We've had a lot of games where Joe Nieuwendyk 
or Mo or Derian Hatcher was not there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Modano was replaced on the top line Thursday by Tony Hrkac, who  
had missed 16 games with fractured ribs. Hrkac's pass set up Brett 
Hull's game-winning goal with 2:50 remaining. 
</P>
<P>
	``This team will not dwell on injuries,'' defenseman Craig  
Ludwig said. ``We have a veteran team and we have depth. Somebody 
steps up. Look at Tony.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dallas was 2-2 during Modano's four-game layoff in April with a  
strained groin. 
</P>
<P>
	Modano's injury might force Hitchcock to experiment with  
different combinations during a low-scoring series in which a 
single mistake or an instant of confusion might cost a game. 
</P>
<P>
	The mirror-image, defense-driven teams promised plenty of  
physical play and passion before the series began, and they've 
delivered. The Sabres' Alexei Zhitnik promises more now that the 
site has shifted. 
</P>
<P>
	``It wasn't really physical,'' Zhitnik said of Game 2.  
``Probably the next couple of games will be much more physical. 
This is the type of hockey we play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Stars' reply? Bring it on.  
</P>
<P>
	``The next two games are going to be very physical,'' Pat  
Verbeek said. ``I don't see that settling down. We're all starting 
to feel part of this series now and we're starting to hate one 
another.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Each game in the series will probably get more physical in the  
corners and in front of the net,'' Stars goaltender Ed Belfour 
said. ``It should make for a great series.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A high-scoring series? No. An esthetically pleasing, made-for-TV  
series? No. A series as intensely played as any Stanley Cup in 
recent years? Possibly, yes. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's low-scoring, but it sure is exciting,'' Hitchcock said.

<HEADLINE> Coach Haskins Maintains Innocence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Minnesota basketball coach Clem Haskins  
repeated his denial of wrongdoing Friday despite new evidence that 
he paid for a Hawaiian trip of the woman at the center of the 
scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	Early in the day, the chairman of the Board of Regents told The  
Associated Press that he should resign. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if there was any winning outcome for the university,  
Regent Patricia Spence said she hates ``to think of it as a win or 
lose type of thing. Human tragedy is involved.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Spence added: ``I'm hoping that Clem will resign and can leave  
this situation with some dignity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Spence later told Minnesota Public Radio she was ``not in any  
position to tell Clem what to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know any of the specific findings from the  
investigation. I just hope that he does what's best for himself and 
what's best for the University of Minnesota,'' she told MPR. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators will ask Haskins to explain why he apparently paid  
for a Hawaiian vacation for Jan Gangelhoff, the woman who says she 
did course work for players. 
</P>
<P>
	Gangelhoff, a former office manager in the academic counseling  
unit, has maintained that the nine-day trip in 1995 was a reward 
from Haskins for writing athletes' papers and doing other course 
work beginning in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials with the charter company that arranged the trip said  
Haskins' personal check for $1,050 paid for travel by Gangelhoff 
and another university employee. 
</P>
<P>
	The check was the first document to be made public that supports  
her claim, the Saint Paul Pioneer Press reported Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	University officials gave the newspaper a copy of the Nov. 15,  
1995, check written on Haskins' personal account and signed by him. 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement, Haskins said he sticks by an earlier denial of  
wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
	``My statement was accurate then and is accurate now. I have, I  
am and I will continue to cooperate with the university and its 
investigation,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Tonya Moten Brown, chief of staff for university President Mark  
Yudof, said lawyers investigating the alleged academic fraud intend 
to ask Haskins to ``clear up and explain'' his paying for the 
Hawaii charter. 
</P>
<P>
	University General Counsel Mark Rotenberg said investigators  
want to wait until Haskins, who recently underwent knee surgery, is 
out of the hospital before talking with him about the check. 
</P>
<P>
	Athletic director Mark Dienhart said Haskins' payment may not  
violate NCAA or university rules. 
</P>
<P>
	``Again, it is not a violation to pay for people to travel with  
the team. If I understand correctly, he also paid for other 
people,'' Dienhart told WCCO Radio. 
</P>
<P>
	Rotenberg would not comment on whether any rules were broken.  
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Rotenberg spoke with Haskins' attorney, Ron Zamansky.  
Yudof has authorized discussion of a possible buyout of Haskins' 
contract. 
</P>
<P>
	While there were no extensive discussions planned that day,  
Rotenberg said he hopes to meet soon. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're having a useful dialogue,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Haskins has been under pressure since March, when the Pioneer  
Press reported that Gangelhoff said she had done 400 pieces of 
course work for players from 1993 to 1998. The allegations 
triggered an investigation by the university into possible 
violations of NCAA rules.

<HEADLINE> Jury Weighs Damages in Cobb Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- A federal jury today began considering  
how much money in punitive damages should be awarded to ex-boxer 
Randall ``Tex'' Cobb in his libel suit against Sports Illustrated. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Court Judge Robert Echols said the jury can  
consider the financial resources of Time Inc., the magazine's 
parent, in determining the figure. 
</P>
<P>
	Time Inc. publishes some 25 other magazines, including Time,  
People and Entertainment Weekly. 
</P>
<P>
	The jury Wednesday awarded Cobb $8.5 million in compensatory  
damages from Sports Illustrated. 
</P>
<P>
	Jurors now must decide how much more Cobb should be paid as  
punishment for a 1993 article that said the boxer fixed a fight and 
shared cocaine with the loser. 
</P>
<P>
	Cobb, 46, had asked for $50 million in compensatory damages and  
$100 million in punitive damages. He declined to comment Thursday, 
but previously said the article ended his boxing career and nearly 
ended his acting career. 
</P>
<P>
	In closing arguments today, Cobb's attorney George Bochetto,  
urged jurors to send a message to Time Inc. that with power comes 
responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
	``Instead of the large powerful corporation telling us what its  
standards are and how they'll behave, we have an opportunity to 
tell the corporation how to behave,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Doug Maynard, a Sports Illustrated lawyer, said the jurors  
already had made an impact with the $8.5 million award. Reporters 
working for Time Inc. in the future will think about this verdict 
every time they write a story, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've heard your message. It's been delivered very forcefully.  
It's an earthquake for us,'' Maynard said. 
</P>
<P>
	Cobb sued in 1994 over an article headlined ``The Fix Was In.''  
The story began with an anecdote about the 1992 bout between Cobb 
and Sonny Barch, a journeyman fighter and former Memphis State 
football player. 
</P>
<P>
	The magazine reported that Cobb and Barch discussed how to throw  
the fight. The story said Cobb had an injured shoulder and wanted 
it to end as quickly as possible. 
</P>
<P>
	In the article, Barch said he told Cobb: ``I'm going to have to  
hit you to make it look good. But I won't hit your shoulder.'' 
Barch told Sports Illustrated that Cobb responded: ``Bubba, I 
appreciate it. I'll make it up to you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Barch allowed Cobb to hit him three times, dropping to a knee  
each time and triggering the three-knockdown rule, Sports 
Illustrated reported. Cobb was declared the winner by technical 
knockout. 
</P>
<P>
	The magazine also reported that Barch said he, Cobb and a fight  
promoter shared cocaine after the bout. Sports Illustrated said 
Cobb had tested positive for cocaine use, but said in a follow-up 
item that it was marijuana. 
</P>
<P>
	Eddie Wayland, another lawyer for Sports Illustrated, told the  
jury the article by writers William Nack and Sonja Steptoe was 
accurate and that any damage done to Cobb's reputation was the 
result of his own actions. 
</P>
<P>
	``They believed the story was true. They believed it then and  
they believe it now,'' Wayland said. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Steptoe testified last month she had little evidence  
that Cobb was a willing participant in a fixed fight with Barch. 
</P>
<P>
	Since he quit fighting, Cobb has had roles in several movies,  
including ``Liar, Liar, ``Raising Arizona,'' ``Uncommon Valor'' and 
``The Golden Child.'' He has also been in the TV shows 
``Moonlighting'' and ``MacGyver.''

<HEADLINE> Iraqi Resistance Members To Be Freed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Five former Iraqi military officers who  
claimed they fought Saddam Hussein and then spent 2 1/2 years in 
custody here fighting deportation are bitter about their treatment, 
but happy to be getting out of jail. 
</P>
<P>
	``The system here is good, but the people who represent (the  
government) have brought shame to this country,'' Mohammed Jwer 
Abboud Al-Ammary, a former military cargo plane pilot, told The 
Associated Press on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	A judge ruled Friday that the Iraqis may stay in Nebraska until  
a friendly country agrees to accept them, a judge ruled Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	A sixth Iraqi refused the agreement, the end to a saga that  
began in 1996 when the U.S. airlifted 6,500 Iraqis from Turkey 
following a failed coup in Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
	The men's families were granted asylum, but immigration  
authorities sought deportation of the men based on secret evidence 
that alleged they were actually spies for Hussein. 
</P>
<P>
	The men said they were grateful for the efforts to free them,  
especially those of former CIA Director James Woolsey, now a 
private lawyer who helped fight their deportation. But they also 
feel betrayed by the U.S. government, which they claim promised 
asylum. 
</P>
<P>
	Immigration Judge D.D. Sitgraves denied the men asylum in March  
1998 and ordered them deported, saying they could be double agents. 
The men claimed they would be executed if sent home. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. authorities justified their imprisonment largely on secret  
evidence, a practice in immigration cases that has come under fire 
from federal lawmakers and activists. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, the INS unsealed some of the evidence, testimony  
about the six Iraqis from FBI agents who discussed hunches, 
distaste for the detainees and their feelings about Arab culture. 
Woolsey, the former CIA director, called the detention ``a stain on 
the honor of the United States.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A sixth Iraqi, Ali Yasim Mohammed Karim, said he will never sign  
the freedom deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities have given him until July 9 to change his mind. He  
could eventually be deported to Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd rather die than accept this agreement,'' Karim said.  
</P>
<P>
	The remaining five will be released within two weeks to Lincoln,  
Neb., where their families were resettled. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the deal, the men must abandon any claims for asylum here  
but may remain in Nebraska until they are deported to a friendly 
country. They must report to the INS daily, stay at home at night, 
accept wire taps on their telephones and stay in the county.

<HEADLINE> Coaches Like NCAA Bat Restrictions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OMAHA, Neb. (AP) -- When Florida State experimented with wooden  
bats early in the season, it didn't seem right to coach Mike 
Martin. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was my first game with wooden bats in 25 years,'' Martin  
said. ``We got a two-run lead in the seventh inning and I knew it 
was over. That's a funny feeling in Dick Howser Stadium.'' 
</P>
<P>
	NCAA-mandated restrictions on aluminum bats were a hit with  
College World Series coaches, but they're not sure about making the 
metal bats perform too much like wood. 
</P>
<P>
	``Chicks dig the long ball,'' Miami coach Jim Morris said  
Thursday. ``We still want home runs, too. We know the fans love 
home runs. 
</P>
<P>
	This season, the NCAA imposed restrictions on the size and  
weight of aluminum bats, hoping to curtail the whopping offensive 
numbers that have characterized college baseball in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
	The standards required that bats not exceed 2 5/8 inches in  
diameter, one-quarter inch less than allowed in 1998. Also, the 
difference between the length of the bat and weight was restricted 
to a ratio designed to make powerful aluminum bats act more like 
wooden bats. 
</P>
<P>
	The change came after last year's College World Series, when  
eight teams combined to hit 62 home runs. That was 14 more than the 
previous record in Omaha. 
</P>
<P>
	It included a national championship baseball game with a  
football score. Southern California beat Arizona State 21-14. 
</P>
<P>
	Another concern was safety. Officials were concerned about the  
speed of the ball coming off the bat. 
</P>
<P>
	It took a while, but eventually the teams adjusted.  
</P>
<P>
	``Early on, we didn't see as many opposite-field home runs,''  
Alabama coach Jim Wells said. ``The managers were hitting them out 
with the old bats. I wasn't happy with the new bats, but as the 
season progressed the power was there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Most teams were following the power game, nicknamed ``Gorilla  
Ball,'' that was developed by LSU coach Skip Bertman. The Tigers 
came to Omaha seven times in the 1990s and won four championships. 
</P>
<P>
	``Bertman made all of us decide what we should do,'' Cal  
State-Fullerton coach George Horton said. ``You recruit big strong 
guys, sacrifice some defense and try to score more runs than the 
other team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The new bats didn't stop all the scoring. Nebraska had 50 runs  
in a game this year. Florida State's Marshall McDougall hit six 
home runs in a victory at Maryland last month. And not every team 
saw its home run totals decline. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall, coaches agreed it was the right move.  
</P>
<P>
	``I do worry about losing our run support, and fans like the  
offense,'' Stanford coach Mark Marquess said. ``This made us play 
with more balance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The bottom line for the CWS coaches was that the game was  
improved without being damaged. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't want to take the home run away,'' Texas A&AMP;M coach  
Mark Johnson said. ``In reality, the game was not the same 
hit-and-run, move-the-runner-over type of game. One of our 
obligations we have as coaches is to pass along the game we 
inherited.''

<HEADLINE> Intersex Mice Found at Calif. Refuge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS BANOS, Calif. (AP) -- Something strange is happening to the  
rodents at a Northern California wildlife area where thousands of 
birds were poisoned by toxic runoff from farms in the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
	Both male and female reproductive organs were found in one-third  
of the 87 field mice, house mice, harvest mice and California voles 
trapped last year on land that once collected toxic runoff at the 
Kesterson National Wildlife Refuge. 
</P>
<P>
	Just 3 percent of rodents trapped there showed such  
characteristics in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	``The number of intersex mammals was a surprising finding to  
everybody,'' said Michael Delamore, chief of the U.S. Bureau of 
Reclamation's drainage program in Fresno. ``We're not sure what it 
means, because it's new, and the phenomenon hasn't been widely 
reported.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Technically, the rodents seem to be pseudo-hermaphroditic,  
according to biologist Gary Santolo, who led the investigation. 
They appear to be males from the outside, and lack a vagina, but 
have a fully developed set of female organs internally. 
</P>
<P>
	Some scientists say something in the environment is causing the  
outbreak. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's fair to say that if it happened in four species and  
happened suddenly, it's indicative of an environmental cause of 
some sort,'' said Dr. Richard Auchus, an endocrinologist at the 
University of California at San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
	Animals in the area have been monitored yearly since an  
investigation in 1985 revealed that selenium, a byproduct of 
agricultural runoff, was killing or deforming thousands of birds. 
</P>
<P>
	Massive quantities of selenium, pesticides and other toxic  
chemicals were being deposited in the refuge in ponds that served 
as a sump for farm runoff. The ponds have since been closed and 
filled in at a cost of $50 million. The refuge no longer 
encompasses the ponds. 
</P>
<P>
	Selenium is not believed to be the cause of the hermaphroditic  
rodents. All of them had elevated levels of the element in their 
livers, but studies of selenium's effect on lab mice have not 
induced similar deformities.

<HEADLINE> Tyson Gets OK To Train in Arizona </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- Mike Tyson will return to Arizona to train for  
his next fight, which may come as early as August. 
</P>
<P>
	The former heavyweight champion, who is on probation until  
February, can come back after 3 1/2 months in a Maryland jail because 
of an agreement reached under an interstate compact, according to 
John MacDonald, spokesman for the Arizona Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
	MacDonald said Tyson had to have a legitimate reason to be in  
the state before he could be transferred under the terms of his 
probation stemming from a misdemeanor assault conviction. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson intends to resume training for a bout, possibly in August  
or September, at Las Vegas' MGM Grand hotel and casino. 
</P>
<P>
	Paul Kemp, Tyson's lawyer, said he wasn't sure when the fighter  
will arrive. But court officials said he must be here by Monday, 
when he is to report to the Maricopa County Adult Probation 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm sure he's looking forward to getting back into training  
and boxing,'' Kemp said. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson will find the welcome mat is already out at his old gym.  
</P>
<P>
	``We're already putting up a banner that says `Welcome Back to  
The Community, Mike Tyson,''' Ricky Ricardo, who helps run the gym, 
told The Arizona Republic on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson pleaded no contest to misdemeanor assault charges that  
stemmed from a fender bender in Gaithersburg, Md., last August. He 
will continue with anger management counseling, as well as meeting 
his community service requirements, while in Arizona, Maryland 
corrections officials said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	The boxer last fought in January and was behind on all three  
cards before he knocked out Francois Botha in the fifth round at 
Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
	He later left his equipment in the Phoenix gym before heading  
out to face his sentencing in Maryland. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson also served a prison sentence in Indiana on a rape  
conviction. He registered in Arizona as a sex offender last fall 
when he decided to make Phoenix his home. He also has a home with 
his wife in Maryland.

<HEADLINE> Dismore Posts Best Qualifying Lap </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) -- After posting the best qualifying lap  
for Saturday's Longhorn 500 IRL race at Texas Motor Speedway, Mark 
Dismore let out a big whoop. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have lap speed on our dash, but I never looked at it until  
I did my second lap,'' Dismore said. ``I was just focused on 
driving the car. I went down the back straightaway and looked down 
at the dash and saw that lap, and I yelled in my helmet. I was so 
happy. I didn't know if it would stick, but I knew that it was 
going to be good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dismore shook off an afternoon crash to come back and cover the  
1.5-mile oval in 24.332 seconds Thursday night, a qualifying speed 
of 215.272 mph, good enough for the pole ahead of teammate Scott 
Sharp. 
</P>
<P>
	Sharp, who also drives for the Kelley Racing team and who paced  
both of Thursday's practice sessions, qualified second at 214.839 
mph. Tyce Carlson was third at 214.417 and Greg Ray fourth at 
213.805. 
</P>
<P>
	The 42-year-old Dismore began racing karts in 1968 and won 40  
grand national kart races through 1989. He made his Indy-car debut 
at Mid-Ohio in 1989, and won the Formula Atlantic Pacific Division 
championship in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
	He came to Indy, but did not qualify in 1992-93. He won the 24  
Hours of Daytona in 1993 and at Nazareth in 1994 in his only 
Formula Atlantic start. His best IRL finish is fifth twice. 
</P>
<P>
	``We should have won three or four races, and we had a big goose  
egg. I hope this is the start of a good cycle that's going to be a 
good cycle instead of the cycle it had been. I haven't been the 
luckiest guy in the world, so maybe the monkey has fallen off my 
back,'' Dismore said. 
</P>
<P>
	In his first afternoon run, Dismore made contact with an outside  
retaining wall exiting turn 4. His car became loose between turns 3 
and 4, and there was light damage to his right front wheel. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had a motor today that watered the back tires, and I put  
the thing in the wall,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Dismore, who broke his neck, both feet, right wrist and right  
knee in a crash during practice for the Indy 500 in 1991, climbed 
out of the car without assistance. After evaluation in the infield 
care center, he was cleared to drive. 
</P>
<P>
	``It has not been an easy day. In fact, it has been a bit of a  
downer, actually, but this sure makes up for it,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Defending champion Billy Boat was 11th of 26 entrants at 211.671  
mph. After a good first practice, he said: ``It was a good run. 
We're going to make a few changes to make it better. It feels great 
going in as defending champion, and the heat is not getting to the 
car.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the tires of Boat and Jaques Lazier touched exiting the  
fourth turn, with Boat running high and Lazier low. Both cars spun 
through the infield grass. 
</P>
<P>
	The air temperature was 85 degrees and the track temperature 100  
degrees when the qualifying began. Winds began to kick up and skies 
were threatening, but all drivers got in their qualifying runs 
without rain. 
</P>
<P>
	The qualifying times were well off the track one-lap qualifying  
record of 225.979 mph set last September and the one-lap race 
record of 228.012 set by Tony Stewart a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the Indy Racing League's first competitive event on a  
high-banked oval since the ill-fated VisionAire 500 at Concord, 
N.C., on May 1 in which three spectators were killed by flying 
debris. 
</P>
<P>
	The IRL moved to reduce speeds slightly beginning with the  
Longhorn 500 by lowering maximum RPMs from 10,300 to 10,000. It 
follows a reduction in the RPMs from 10,500 in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Saturday's race is the fifth in the IRL's 11-race season.  
</P>
<P>
	Race speeds Saturday are expected to drop more than 3 mph  
because with the reduction in RPMs. In theory, lower speeds make 
the cars more drivable, resulting in fewer crashes. 
</P>
<P>
	TMS is a 1.5-mile quad-oval with 24-degree banked turns, similar  
to Concord and Atlanta Motor Speedway, which was built for heavier 
and slower stock cars. IRL races have been staged at TMS and 
Concord since 1997 and at Atlanta since 1998.

<HEADLINE> Jury: SI Must Pay Boxer $10.7 Mil. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- A jury on Friday ordered Time Inc. to  
pay $10.7 million to ex-heavyweight boxer Randall ``Tex'' Cobb for 
a 1993 Sports Illustrated article that said he fixed a fight and 
shared cocaine with the loser. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal jury awarded Cobb $2.2 million in punitive damages  
to go with $8.5 million it awarded Wednesday in compensatory 
damages. He had demanded up to $100 million in his libel lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	Judge Robert Echols ruled that the jury could consider the  
financial resources of Time Inc., the magazine's parent, in 
determining the punitive damage figure. 
</P>
<P>
	Echols must still give the figure final approval, and the  
magazine said it would appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	When the award was announced, Cobb, 46, shook hands with his  
attorney, who patted him on the hand. Cobb had contended the 
article ended his boxing career and nearly ended his acting career. 
</P>
<P>
	``Tex has been a prisoner of this article for six years and  
there's no better feeling in the world than to have a jury come in 
and set the record straight,'' attorney George Bochetto said. He 
said the verdict tells magazine officials ``that they did wrong and 
you better not do it again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Steve Robinson, managing editor of CNN-SI and a former Sports  
Illustrated senior editor who worked on the story, said the verdict 
``shocked us,'' adding, ``we're very confident we will prevail on 
appeal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cobb sued in 1994 over the article headlined ``The Fix Was In.''  
The story began with an anecdote about the 1992 bout between Cobb 
and Sonny Barch, a journeyman fighter and former Memphis State 
football player. 
</P>
<P>
	The magazine said Cobb and Barch discussed how to throw the  
fight. The story said Cobb had an injured shoulder and wanted it to 
end as quickly as possible. 
</P>
<P>
	In the article, Barch said he told Cobb: ``I'm going to have to  
hit you to make it look good. But I won't hit your shoulder.'' 
Barch said that Cobb responded: ``Bubba, I appreciate it. I'll make 
it up to you,'' according to the article. 
</P>
<P>
	Barch allowed Cobb to hit him three times, dropping to a knee  
each time and triggering the three-knockdown rule, Sports 
Illustrated reported. Cobb was declared the winner by technical 
knockout 70 seconds into the fight. 
</P>
<P>
	The magazine also reported that Barch said he, Cobb and a fight  
promoter shared cocaine after the bout. Sports Illustrated reported 
that both Barch and Cobb had flunked post-fight drug tests and the 
fight was declared a no-contest. In a follow-up, Sports Illustrated 
said that Cobb had tested positive for marijuana. 
</P>
<P>
	Sports Illustrated lawyer Eddie Wayland told the jury that the  
article by writers William Nack and Sonja Steptoe was accurate and 
that any damage to Cobb's reputation was the result of his own 
actions. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Ms. Steptoe testified last month she had little  
evidence that Cobb was a willing participant in a fixed fight with 
Barch. And boxing referee Steven Smoger said Cobb showed 
``excellent'' technique. 
</P>
<P>
	Since he quit fighting, Cobb has had roles in movies including  
``Liar, Liar,'' ``Raising Arizona,'' ``Uncommon Valor'' and ``The 
Golden Child.'' He has also been in the TV shows ``Moonlighting'' 
and ``MacGyver.''

<HEADLINE> Notification Forces Teen's Retrial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RICHMOND, Va. (AP) -- The Virginia Supreme Court ruled Friday  
that both parents must be notified when a minor is arrested -- a 
decision that may enable thousands of juvenile prisoners to 
challenge their convictions. 
</P>
<P>
	The unanimous ruling affirmed a Virginia Court of Appeals  
decision ordering a new trial for Jeramie Baker, who was convicted 
at 17 of trying to rob a convenience store and stabbing a clerk. 
Only his mother was notified of his arrest, despite a state law 
that says summonses must go ``to the parents'' of the juvenile. 
</P>
<P>
	Before the appeals court ruling, it was common practice for  
Virginia prosecutors to notify only one parent. Baker's lawyer said 
that practice is no longer good enough. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're at a time when people are suggesting we hold parents  
more responsible for their children's behavior,'' lawyer Clifford 
Y. Rose said. ``If you're going to do that, you've got to let them 
know what's going on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors said the ruling means thousands of convictions --  
including those of murderers and other violent offenders -- could be 
open to challenge. 
</P>
<P>
	Alarmed by the potential consequences, the General Assembly last  
winter changed the law to require notification of only one parent. 
However, that law doesn't take effect until July 1 and is not 
retroactive. 
</P>
<P>
	The ruling does not mean juveniles will be automatically  
released. 
</P>
<P>
	``Virginia should not be greatly concerned about a mass exodus  
of juvenile offenders from detention facilities,'' said David 
Botkins, spokesman for Attorney General Mark L. Earley. 
</P>
<P>
	Any jailed youth seeking release based on the ruling would have  
to go back to court, go through another trial and risk getting a 
stiffer sentence when retried, Botkins said. 
</P>
<P>
	Henrico County Commonwealth's Attorney Toby Vick said the ruling  
will probably crowd court dockets with requests to throw out 
convictions. 
</P>
<P>
	``And who knows what ability we would have to reconstruct and  
retry those cases?'' he said. ``In Henrico, we will make an effort 
to retry the serious ones.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The state had argued that the notification requirement in  
Baker's case was met because the law also allows notification of a 
guardian or legal custodian. Baker's mother, the state argued, 
qualified as his guardian. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Supreme Court said the use of the plural ``parents''  
made it clear authorities must at least make an effort to reach 
both mother and father. 
</P>
<P>
	``Here, even though the juvenile's mother received notice, the  
juvenile's biological father was not notified, there was no attempt 
to give him notice, and the circuit court made no certification on 
the record that the identity of the father was not reasonably 
ascertainable,'' the justices wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	Baker's parents split up when he was 4, and his father's address  
was unknown when the teen-ager was charged in 1996. He was 
sentenced to three years and four months in prison.

shortcuts,'' he said. ``This is an important due process 
decision.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Baker's parents split up when he was 4, and his father's address  
was unknown when the teen-ager was charged in Stafford County in 
1996 with attempting to rob a convenience store and stabbing a

<P>
	Rose said he expects the county to retry his client, who was  
convicted as an adult and is still in a state prison. He said he 
did not know when Baker would be released.

<HEADLINE> NBA Players Union Protests Fines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The NBA players' union was preparing Friday to  
file a grievance on behalf of two teams fined $25,000 each by the 
league for giving players expense-paid trips. 
</P>
<P>
	The union announced the action on Friday, a day after the league  
penalized the Dallas Mavericks and Sacramento Kings for salary cap 
violations. 
</P>
<P>
	``The papers are still being drawn up,'' union spokesman Dan  
Wasserman said Friday, adding that the grievance may not be filed 
until early next week. ``A grievance will be filed when all the 
paperwork is done. 
</P>
<P>
	``As far as the players' association is concerned, the NBA is  
not authorized to impose fines in this case under terms of 
collective bargaining agreement. The union does not consider this a 
salary cap violation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Don Nelson, coach and general manager of the Mavericks, arranged  
for Gary Trent, his fiancee, their infant son, Trent's parents and 
his fiancee's mother to spend a week at his Maui, Hawaii, vacation 
home last month. 
</P>
<P>
	The Kings recently provided several players with an  
expenses-paid trip to Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
	Nelson said he hoped the vacation would serve as a goodwill  
gesture to the 6-foot-8, 250-pound Trent, whom the Mavericks are 
aggressively trying to re-sign. 
</P>
<P>
	Trent averaged 16 points and 7.8 rebounds this season and was  
third in the balloting for the league's Most Improved Player award. 
His salary this season was $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Nelson has not been bashful in efforts to persuade Trent to  
remain in Dallas. But the Mavericks can't exceed the salary cap to 
re-sign him, so they are limited to paying Trent no more than $5 
million the next two years. 
</P>
<P>
	A team can exceed the salary cap in re-signing a player only if  
he has been on the roster three or more seasons.

<HEADLINE> FHA Raises Bar for Home Appraisals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Appraisers must provide a much more detailed  
description of defects in prospective homes to families with 
government-insured mortgages, under a new initiative by the Federal 
Housing Administration. 
</P>
<P>
	The reforms, announced Thursday, seek to improve the quality of  
appraisals and give home buyers complete information on the 
condition of the homes they are considering for purchase. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the plan, appraisers must fully disclose any structural  
problems the homes may have. The three-page form requires 
appraisers to describe defects in a wide range of areas such as 
plumbing, electrical systems, foundations and the presence of 
wood-destroying insects. 
</P>
<P>
	Such concerns must be reported to prospective customers in  
writing, and the FHA will not insure the mortgage on the home until 
sellers fix the defects. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will do more than any other mortgage insurer to safeguard  
the interests of hardworking families buying homes,'' said Andrew 
Cuomo, secretary of the department of Housing and Urban 
Development. 
</P>
<P>
	The new initiatives also seek to improve the quality of home  
appraisers. Typically, lenders select appraisers, who report on the 
value of the home and conduct a review of its physical condition. 
But the FHA must approve the appraisers, if the lender is seeking 
to have its loan financed with an FHA mortgage. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the plan, all new appraisers must pass a mandatory test to  
ensure they are qualified to perform FHA appraisals. Old appraisers 
have until February to pass the test. Additional enforcement 
regulations will enable the FHA to suspend appraisers who are not 
performing up to standards. 
</P>
<P>
	The department came up with the plan after receiving complaints  
from home buyers, who were faced with thousands of dollars in 
repair costs after purchasing homes with substantial defects. More 
than 1 million families purchase homes annually with mortgage loans 
made by private lenders and insured by the FHA. 
</P>
<P>
	The FHA is also encouraging home buyers to get inspections of  
prospective homes, in addition to appraisals. Inspections generally 
provide a more detailed evaluation of the home's condition. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mortgage Bankers Association of America, a trade  
organization, applauded the plan as a reasonable balance between 
protecting consumers and keeping real-estate transactions 
efficient. The group, which had opposed calls by some in Congress 
last year for mandatory inspections, said it would help inform 
consumers about the benefits of inspections. 
</P>
<P>
	``Better education and higher appraisal standards make more  
sense for everyone,'' said Michael Ferrell, senior vice president 
of the industry group.

<HEADLINE> Judge Makes Ruling in Cannibal Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RIVERHEAD, N.Y. (AP) -- A former teacher who confessed to killing  
a teen-ager and eating some of his body parts must remain in 
psychiatric care, a judge ruled. 
</P>
<P>
	Albert Fentress has been confined to mental hospitals since he  
was found innocent by reason of insanity in the August 1979 killing 
of Paul Masters. 
</P>
<P>
	Fentress, 57, was granted a jury trial in April after he  
contested a decision to extend his confinement. Although the jurors 
found he was mentally ill, they ruled he was no longer a danger to 
society and should be freed. 
</P>
<P>
	State Supreme Court Judge Harry Seidell on Thursday set aside  
that verdict. For jurors to believe Fentress was mentally ill but 
not in need of institutional care, they would have to believe he 
``would somehow, on his own, develop self-control and not pose a 
danger to others,'' Seidell said. 
</P>
<P>
	Fentress confessed to killing 18-year-old Masters after the  
youth wandered into his backyard. Then a middle school teacher, 
Fentress lured Masters into his basement, tied him to a post, 
sexually abused and mutilated him, and shot him twice in the head 
before cooking and eating parts of the teen's body. 
</P>
<P>
	``Given the unspeakable crime which he committed, and his mental  
condition, we feel Fentress remains a danger and therefore should 
not be released,'' said state Attorney General Eliot Spitzer. 
</P>
<P>
	A lawyer for Fentress, Kim Darrow, disagreed.  
</P>
<P>
	``Once he's not dangerous, he's supposed to be let go,'' Darrow  
said. ``I think he's been ready for a long time.''

<HEADLINE> Pavarotti Nervous About Lebanon Show </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) -- Luciano Pavarotti says he is nervous  
about performing for the first time before an audience in the 
Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
	The Italian tenor is scheduled to give a two-hour concert at a  
stadium here Saturday in what organizers have billed as a 
``historic event'' to mark the country's emergence from the 1975-90 
civil war. 
</P>
<P>
	``I tell you, I will be afraid just like the first time I sang  
April 29, 1961,'' Pavarotti told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	When asked why he had chosen to perform in Beirut, he said: ``Is  
there a reason why I should not? I've been treated like a king, 
flown in on a beautiful, sumptuous plane and surrounded by 
beautiful women.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Organizers estimate that 18,000 people will attend the two-day  
concert. Ticket prices range between $35 to $300 -- about 50 percent 
more than the minimum monthly salary here. Proceeds will go to 
charity.

<HEADLINE> American Airlines Hit With Suit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- An Irving man injured in last week's deadly  
American Airlines crash in Little Rock, Ark., has filed a lawsuit 
claiming the airline trained its pilots in unsafe cockpit 
practices. 
</P>
<P>
	Ron Pennington, 44, was aboard American Airlines Flight 1420 on  
June 1 when the plane sped off the runway while landing and crashed 
into the steel posts of a catwalk. 
</P>
<P>
	Ten people, including Capt. Richard Buschmann, died and more  
than 80 were injured when the plane broke up and caught fire. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit, filed Friday in a Dallas County district court,  
contends Buschmann and a co-pilot did not follow a landing 
checklist, including failing to arm the landing spoilers. 
</P>
<P>
	The suit -- which does not specify damages -- blames American  
Airlines and its parent company, AMR Corp., for adopting ``policies 
and practices which were contrary to safe cockpit resource 
management.'' 
</P>
<P>
	American Airlines spokesman Chris Chiames said he found it  
``curious'' that lawyers have determined the cause of the accident 
before the National Transportation Safety Board. 
</P>
<P>
	Three other lawsuits have been filed regarding the crash,  
including one filed in Little Rock by the family of Debra Sattari 
of Vallejo, Calif., who died in the accident. The lawsuit claims 
the airline was negligent for trying to land the plane in a storm. 
</P>
<P>
	Survivors in Chicago and Little Rock also have sued American.

<HEADLINE> Orioles Bench Belle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 *AP Sports Writer	   ATLANTA (AP) -- Baltimore's Albert Belle did not play Friday    	
against the Braves after a shouting match with Orioles manager Ray  
Miller, ending the outfielder's streak of 392 consecutive games 
played. 
</P>
<P>
	Belle, who was baseball's active leader in consecutive games  
played, was replaced in right field by Jeff Conine. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just came in and saw the lineup,'' said Conine, who went  
3-for-5 in Baltimore's 6-2 victory. ``That's all I want to say 
about it. It's a sensitive issue.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Both Belle and Miller have declined to comment on the incident,  
which occurred during Wednesday night's 4-2 victory over the 
Florida Marlins. 
</P>
<P>
	``Albert Belle just didn't play tonight,'' Miller said. ``That's  
all I've got to say on that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Miller said he preferred to keep the focus on Sidney Ponson, who  
pitched a five-hitter to beat Greg Maddux and the Braves. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not going to talk about Albert Belle when we just had a  
guy pitch an outstanding game,'' the manager said. 
</P>
<P>
	Miller indicated before the game that Belle would return to the  
lineup Saturday, but he wouldn't address the issue after. ``We'll 
see about that when the lineup goes up tomorrow,'' the manager 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Belle came out on the field to congratulate his teammates after  
the game and, according to Miller, ``He was in the dugout shaking 
hands with everybody the whole game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As usual, Belle declined to speak with reporters.  
</P>
<P>
	Belle, who has gone through a disappointing season, failed to  
run out a ground ball in the top of the ninth Wednesday night, 
completing an 0-for-5 game. 
</P>
<P>
	In the bottom of the inning, Miller replaced Belle in the  
outfield with Rich Amaral, a move the manager said he planned to 
make before Belle's groundout. But the temperamental slugger was 
unaware of the move until he was on his way to his outfield 
position, eventually jogging back to the dugout. 
</P>
<P>
	In the dugout, TV cameras caught an exchange of profanities  
between Miller and Belle. Belle yelled angrily at Miller and was 
restrained by teammate Jeff Reboulet. Miller waved Belle off with a 
toss of his hand. 
</P>
<P>
	Belle, who signed a $65 million, five-year contract with  
Baltimore in December, has been suspended six times during his 
career and his disdain of the media is well known. 
</P>
<P>
	Belle was hitting only .244 with one home run in his previous 21  
games. The Orioles, with a $78.5 million opening-day payroll, are 
the most disappointing team in baseball with a 22-36 record, and 
there has been speculation that Miller's job is in jeopardy. 
</P>
<P>
	Colorado's Vinny Castilla now has the longest active streak of  
consecutive games -- 304 including Friday night's game at Texas.

<HEADLINE> Lawmakers Can Recycling in House </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The House of Representatives has rejected  
mandatory recycling for its offices. 
</P>
<P>
	The House has had a voluntary recycling program for a decade.  
But The Associated Press reported last month that most 
congressional offices were still mixing garbage, aluminum cans, 
bottles and different grades of paper. Many federal agencies and 
local governments separate their trash and sell recyclable 
material. 
</P>
<P>
	A provision that would have required House offices to begin  
recycling their trash was killed by the chamber Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
	The language was struck from a $1.9 billion bill financing  
Congress' own operations next year after running into objections 
from Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
	The provision, sponsored by Rep. Sam Farr, D-Calif., would have  
made the program compulsory for all House offices and given money 
earned to the House's child care center. The Senate has no similar 
program. 
</P>
<P>
	The language was removed from the bill on a procedural challenge  
by Rep. Robert Ney, R-Ohio, who said it would have used a spending 
bill to change law. That is against House rules. 
</P>
<P>
	``You don't like it, you don't want to deal with recycling,''  
Farr said on the floor after Ney voiced his objection. 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview, Ney said he objected to the plan because he  
opposes imposing requirements on House offices. He also said the 
House Administration Committee, of which he is a member, should 
have jurisdiction over such proposals.

<HEADLINE>  New Spring Football League Forms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- For now, the best way to assess the new spring  
football league that was announced Friday is by its initials -- IFF. 
</P>
<P>
	In other words, the International Football Federation, which  
hopes to start in February, has a chance to succeed IF: 
</P>
<P>
	--it can get a television contract; it is seeking one and its  
last resort is showing games on the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	--it can bring respectable crowds to such venues as Giants  
Stadium and the Rose Bowl by drawing fans from other spring sports 
-- baseball, the NBA and NHL playoffs, the WNBA and Arena Football. 
</P>
<P>
	--it avoids the internal bickering and overspending that doomed  
such football ventures as the World League in the 1970s and the 
USFL in the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
	Right now, there are 13 proposed franchises -- Honolulu was a  
last-minute entry Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	There are five in NFL cities -- New York, Chicago, Detroit,  
Boston and Denver. The others include two in the Los Angeles area 
and franchises in Toronto, San Jose, Calif., Texas, Toronto and 
Connecticut. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want football 12 months of the year,'' said entertainer  
Dionne Warwick, who will be a part owner of the two franchises in 
Southern California, which lost two NFL teams after the 1994 season 
and is having trouble getting together on an expansion team. 
</P>
<P>
	The new league is the brainchild of Dennis Murphy, who helped  
found both the American Basketball Association and the World Hockey 
Association in the '70s. They eventually merged some of their 
franchise with the NBA and NHL. 
</P>
<P>
	``The marketplace is better now than it was then,'' Murphy said  
at a news conference. ``Then there were three networks. Now there 
are 200 channels on Direct TV, cable, what have you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Davidson and Edward Litwack, the league's president and chief  
executive officer, acknowledged having preliminary discussions with 
NBC and Turner Broadcasting, the networks that lost out in the $18 
billion NFL contract negotiated in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	But both executives said neither NBC nor Turner will be ready  
for the inaugural season, which will run from February to July next 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	NBC and Turner Sports previously said they are considering  
sponsorship of a new football league but no plan has been put 
forward. 
</P>
<P>
	Litwack runs his own cable television systems that could be used  
for a syndicated package and sold individually to local stations or 
cable networks. He also said the games could be shown on the 
Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	Litwack emphasized that unlike the earlier leagues, the IFF  
would not threaten the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want to live in harmony,'' he said.

<HEADLINE>  Military Activity Fills Macedonia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PETROVEC, Macedonia (AP) -- German-tracked vehicles stormed up a  
dusty trail, American Marines lolled under fragrant trees to escape 
the 90-degree heat and a British officer in a T-shirt wondered 
aloud: What can the Russians be up to in Serbia? 
</P>
<P>
	The rolling green hills of northern Macedonia seethed with  
activity Friday as NATO forces prepared for their peacekeeping 
mission to Kosovo and the return of hundreds of thousands of ethnic 
Albanian refugees. 
</P>
<P>
	Helicopters chuffed back and forth overhead ferrying men and  
equipment, after Russia surprised NATO by sending a convoy of 
soldiers into Yugoslavia and south toward Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	``Have you heard what the Russians have done?'' asked the  
British officer, referring to the troop movements. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were going to shoot right up the road to Pristina. Now I'm  
not sure what we're going to do,'' said the officer, who declined 
to give his name. 
</P>
<P>
	To the north, British paratroopers in full combat gear waited  
for hours in the blazing sun near Macedonia's border with Kosovo, 
their deployment on the heels of withdrawing Serb army and police 
forces seemingly imminent. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, they were told to stand down because they would not enter  
the province until Saturday morning, British military officials 
said. They would be given an hour's notice once an order had been 
given to move into the Yugoslav province, said a British source who 
would not give his name. 
</P>

	Moscow vehemently opposed NATO's air war against Yugoslavia and

forcefully.

<P>
	The Russian convoy entered Yugoslavia from Bosnia, where the  
Russians have been participating in the peacekeeping force there 
since 1995, and headed south. The convoy, headed by a Yugoslav

<HEADLINE>  Military Activity Fills Macedonia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PETROVEC, Macedonia (AP) -- German-tracked vehicles stormed up a  
dusty trail, American Marines lolled under fragrant trees to escape 
the 90-degree heat and a British officer in a T-shirt wondered 
aloud: What can the Russians be up to in Serbia? 
</P>
<P>
	The rolling green hills of northern Macedonia seethed with  
activity Friday as NATO forces prepared for their peacekeeping 
mission to Kosovo and the return of hundreds of thousands of ethnic 
Albanian refugees. 
</P>
<P>
	Helicopters chuffed back and forth overhead ferrying men and  
equipment, after Russia surprised NATO by sending a convoy of 
soldiers into Yugoslavia and south toward Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	``Have you heard what the Russians have done?'' asked the  
British officer, referring to the troop movements. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were going to shoot right up the road to Pristina. Now I'm  
not sure what we're going to do,'' said the officer, who declined 
to give his name. 
</P>
<P>
	To the north, British paratroopers in full combat gear waited  
for hours in the blazing sun near Macedonia's border with Kosovo, 
their deployment on the heels of withdrawing Serb army and police 
forces seemingly imminent. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, they were told to stand down because they would not enter  
the province until Saturday morning, British military officials 
said. They would be given an hour's notice once an order had been 
given to move into the Yugoslav province, said a British source who 
would not give his name.

<HEADLINE>  Miami, Rice Says It's All Pitching </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OMAHA, Neb. (AP) -- To hear Miami coach Jim Morris and Rice coach  
Wayne Graham, college baseball isn't about home runs anymore. Both 
insisted Thursday their matchup to open the College World Series is 
about pitching. 
</P>
<P>
	The top-seeded Hurricanes (46-13) and No. 8 Owls (58-13) play  
Friday night after the College World Series, celebrating its 50th 
year in Omaha, opens with a matinee between No. 4 Oklahoma State 
(46-19) and No. 5 Alabama (51-14). 
</P>
<P>
	Asked Thursday what Rice needs to do to beat Miami, Graham said  
it depends on what the Owls can do against Hurricanes right-hander 
Alex Santos (11-3, 3.10 ERA). 
</P>
<P>
	``My concern is scoring off Santos,'' Graham said. ``He's pretty  
good. We've got to pitch well, play defense well and scratch a few 
runs off Santos.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Morris, seated next to Graham during a news conference for the  
eight CWS coaches, returned the compliment for Rice ace Mario Ramos 
(13-2, 2.42). 
</P>
<P>
	``I could throw in Ramos and duplicate what he just said. Any  
time you're going against a left-hander, you always have to take 
advantage of every scoring opportunity you get,'' Morris said. 
</P>
<P>
	Morris said this isn't the typical Miami collection of sluggers  
with their mighty alumninum bats. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd say we're a pitching and defense team,'' Morris said.  
``That's kind of amazing to sit up here and say with all the talk 
of alumninum bats. Our guys play hard. They feel someone is going 
to get it done for them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Morris said that, in any given game, he doesn't know who will  
carry the Hurricanes. One of the leaders is shortstop Bobby Hill 
(.378, 9 HRs, 28 RBIs), who stole 50 bases this season to become 
Miami's career leader with 137. 
</P>
<P>
	Rice has won 31 of its last 36, and the Owls got gritty after  
losing their openers in the regional and super regionals. The top 
hitters are outfielder Will Ford (.403, 11, 70) and shortstop Damon 
Thames (.377, 9, 68). 
</P>
<P>
	According to rankings established by Collegiate Baseball, Miami  
is No. 1 nationally and Rice No. 2. But forget about it. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a great matchup to start the series,'' Thames said. ``I  
think our biggest challenge is just to forget about the rankings 
and see how it goes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Alabama enters the College World Series with a 15-game winning  
streak and has won 23 of its last 25. Not bad for a team that 
sometimes has as many as five freshmen in the lineup. 
</P>
<P>
	The Tide will start left-hander Justin Smith (5-4, 5.91), a  
junior from Elk City, Okla., who knows folks back home might be 
cheering for Oklahoma State. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm trying not to think about it too much,'' Smith said. ``If  
I just throw my game, I'll be all right. Coach (Jim) Wells has it 
all mapped out. He calls the pitches and I just throw the ball.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Cowboys send right-hander Thom Dreier (8-5, 3.61) to the  
mound, and he'll be tested against a hard-hiting Alabama lineup. 
</P>
<P>
	Shortstop Andy Phillips (.393, 22, 66) has a school-record  
33-game hitting streak and became the Tide's home run king this 
season. With 61 career home runs, he is tied with former 
Missississipi State standout Will Clark for third on the 
Southeastern Conference list. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cowboys hit 130 home runs this season, fourth-best in school  
history, and outfielder Lamont Matthews (.396, 30, 105) led the 
way. 
</P>
<P>
	``He does excite people when he comes to the plate,'' Oklahoma  
State coach Tom Holliday said.

<HEADLINE>  New Spring Football League Forms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- For now, the best way to assess the new spring  
football league that was announced Friday is by its initials -- IFF. 
</P>
<P>
	In other words, the International Football Federation, which  
hopes to start in February, has a chance to succeed IF: 
</P>
<P>
	--it can get a television contract; it is seeking one and its  
last resort is showing games on the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	--it can bring respectable crowds to such venues as Giants  
Stadium and the Rose Bowl by drawing fans from other spring sports 
-- baseball, the NBA and NHL playoffs, the WNBA and Arena Football. 
</P>
<P>
	--it avoids the internal bickering and overspending that doomed  
such football ventures as the World League in the 1970s and the 
USFL in the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
	Right now, there are 13 proposed franchises -- Honolulu was a  
last-minute entry Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	There are five in NFL cities -- New York, Chicago, Detroit,  
Boston and Denver. The others include two in the Los Angeles area 
and franchises in Toronto, San Jose, Calif., Texas, Toronto and 
Connecticut. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want football 12 months of the year,'' said entertainer  
Dionne Warwick, who will be a part owner of the two franchises in 
Southern California, which lost two NFL teams after the 1994 season 
and is having trouble getting together on an expansion team. 
</P>
<P>
	The new league is the brainchild of Dennis Murphy, who helped  
found both the American Basketball Association and the World Hockey 
Association in the '70s. They eventually merged some of their 
franchise with the NBA and NHL. 
</P>
<P>
	``The marketplace is better now than it was then,'' Murphy said  
at a news conference. ``Then there were three networks. Now there 
are 200 channels on Direct TV, cable, what have you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Davidson and Edward Litwack, the league's president and chief  
executive officer, acknowledged having preliminary discussions with 
NBC and Turner Broadcasting, the networks that lost out in the $18 
billion NFL contract negotiated in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	But both executives said neither NBC nor Turner will be ready  
for the inaugural season, which will run from February to July next 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	NBC and Turner Sports previously said they are considering  
sponsorship of a new football league but no plan has been put 
forward. 
</P>
<P>
	Litwack runs his own cable television systems that could be used  
for a syndicated package and sold individually to local stations or 
cable networks. He also said the games could be shown on the 
Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	Litwack emphasized that unlike the earlier leagues, the IFF  
would not threaten the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want to live in harmony,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Jury: SI Must Pay Boxer $10.7 Mil. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Time Inc. must pay ex-heavyweight boxer  
Randall ``Tex'' Cobb $10.7 million for a 1993 Sports Illustrated 
article saying he fixed a fight and shared cocaine with the loser, 
a federal jury decided today. 
</P>
<P>
	Jurors awarded Cobb $2.2 million in punitive damages today to go  
with $8.5 million that they awarded Wednesday in compensatory 
damages. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. District Court jury deliberated Cobb's demand for up to  
$100 million after Judge Robert Echols ruled that the panel could 
consider the financial resources of Time Inc., the magazine's 
parent, in determining the punitive damage figure. 
</P>
<P>
	When the award was announced today, Cobb shook hands with his  
attorney, who patted him on the hand. Echols must still give final 
approval to the punitive damages figure, and told lawyers to submit 
briefs to his consideration. 
</P>
<P>
	Cobb, 46, contended the 1993 magazine article ended his boxing  
career and nearly ended his acting career. 
</P>
<P>
	``Tex has been a prisoner of this article for six years and  
there's no better feeling in the world than to have a jury come in 
and set the record straight,'' Cobb attorney George Bochetto said. 
He said the verdict tells magazine officials ``that they did wrong 
and you better not do it again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Steve Robinson, managing editor of CNN-SI and a former Sports  
Illustrated senior editor who worked on the story, said the verdict 
``shocked us,'' adding, ``we're very confident we will prevail on 
appeal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In his closing argument to jurors earlier today, Doug Maynard, a  
Sports Illustrated lawyer, said they already had made an impact 
with the $8.5 million award. Reporters working for Time Inc. in the 
future will think about this verdict every time they write a story, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've heard your message. It's been delivered very forcefully.  
It's an earthquake for us,'' Maynard said. 
</P>
<P>
	Cobb sued in 1994 over the article headlined ``The Fix Was In.''  
The story began with an anecdote about the 1992 bout between Cobb 
and Sonny Barch, a journeyman fighter and former Memphis State 
football player. The fight ended in 70 seconds with a Cobb victory. 
</P>
<P>
	The magazine said Cobb and Barch discussed how to throw the  
fight. The story said Cobb had an injured shoulder and wanted it to 
end as quickly as possible. 
</P>
<P>
	In the article, Barch said he told Cobb: ``I'm going to have to  
hit you to make it look good. But I won't hit your shoulder.'' 
Barch said that Cobb responded: ``Bubba, I appreciate it. I'll make 
it up to you,'' according to the article. 
</P>
<P>
	Barch allowed Cobb to hit him three times, dropping to a knee  
each time and triggering the three-knockdown rule, Sports 
Illustrated reported. Cobb was declared the winner by technical 
knockout. 
</P>
<P>
	The magazine also reported that Barch said he, Cobb and a fight  
promoter shared cocaine after the bout. Sports Illustrated said 
Cobb had tested positive for cocaine use, but said in a follow-up 
item that the substance was marijuana. 
</P>
<P>
	Wayland told the jury that the article by writers William Nack  
and Sonja Steptoe was accurate and that any damage to Cobb's 
reputation was the result of his own actions. 
</P>
<P>
	``They believed the story was true. They believed it then and  
they believe it now,'' Wayland said. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Ms. Steptoe testified last month she had little  
evidence that Cobb was a willing participant in a fixed fight with 
Barch. And boxing referee Steven Smoger said Cobb showed 
``excellent'' technique. 
</P>
<P>
	Since he quit fighting, Cobb has had roles in movies including  
``Liar, Liar,'' ``Raising Arizona,'' ``Uncommon Valor'' and ``The 
Golden Child.'' He has also been in the TV shows ``Moonlighting'' 
and ``MacGyver.''

	``My concern is scoring off Santos,'' Graham said. ``He's pretty  
good. We've got to pitch well, play defense well and scratch a few 
runs off Santos.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Morris, seated next to Graham during a news conference for the  
eight CWS coaches, returned the compliment for Rice ace Mario Ramos 
(13-2, 2.42). 
</P>
<P>
	``I could throw in Ramos and duplicate what he just said. Any  
time you're going against a left-hander, you always have to take 
advantage of every scoring opportunity you get,'' Morris said. 
</P>
<P>
	Morris said this isn't the typical Miami collection of sluggers  
with their mighty alumninum bats. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd say we're a pitching and defense team,'' Morris said.  
``That's kind of amazing to sit up here and say with all the talk 
of alumninum bats. Our guys play hard. They feel someone is going 
to get it done for them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Morris said that, in any given game, he doesn't know who will  
carry the Hurricanes. One of the leaders is shortstop Bobby Hill 
(.378, 9 HRs, 28 RBIs), who stole 50 bases this season to become 
Miami's career leader with 137. 
</P>
<P>
	Rice has won 31 of its last 36, and the Owls got gritty after  
losing their openers in the regional and super regionals. The top 
hitters are outfielder Will Ford (.403, 11, 70) and shortstop Damon 
Thames (.377, 9, 68). 
</P>
<P>
	According to rankings established by Collegiate Baseball, Miami  
is No. 1 nationally and Rice No. 2. But forget about it. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a great matchup to start the series,'' Thames said. ``I  
think our biggest challenge is just to forget about the rankings 
and see how it goes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Alabama enters the College World Series with a 15-game winning  
streak and has won 23 of its last 25. Not bad for a team that 
sometimes has as many as five freshmen in the lineup. 
</P>
<P>
	The Tide will start left-hander Justin Smith (5-4, 5.91), a  
junior from Elk City, Okla., who knows folks back home might be 
cheering for Oklahoma State. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm trying not to think about it too much,'' Smith said. ``If  
I just throw my game, I'll be all right. Coach (Jim) Wells has it 
all mapped out. He calls the pitches and I just throw the ball.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Cowboys send right-hander Thom Dreier (8-5, 3.61) to the  
mound, and he'll be tested against a hard-hiting Alabama lineup. 
</P>
<P>
	Shortstop Andy Phillips (.393, 22, 66) has a school-record  
33-game hitting streak and became the Tide's home run king this 
season. With 61 career home runs, he is tied with former 
Missississipi State standout Will Clark for third on the 
Southeastern Conference list. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cowboys hit 130 home runs this season, fourth-best in school  
history, and outfielder Lamont Matthews (.396, 30, 105) led the 
way. 
</P>
<P>
	``He does excite people when he comes to the plate,'' Oklahoma  
State coach Tom Holliday said.

<HEADLINE> With War Over, Complications Begin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- It sounded simple: Serb troops out of Kosovo,  
NATO peacekeepers in, refugees back to their homes. 
</P>
<P>
	Now that peace is at hand, this formula for success in Kosovo is  
looking more complicated than suggested by the daily recitation in 
allied capitals during 11 weeks of bombing. 
</P>
<P>
	For example, getting the 40,000 Serb army troops, special police  
and paramilitary forces -- along with their hundreds of tanks, 
artillery, air defense weapons and other equipment -- out of the 
province over bomb-damaged roads and bridges will take more than 
the seven days NATO initially had expected. 
</P>
<P>
	``The dangers aren't over. Indeed, in some respects the dangers  
begin,'' British Prime Minister Tony Blair said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We still have to win the peace,'' President Clinton told  
airmen and their families at Whiteman Air Force Base, Mo. 
</P>
<P>
	Even as the peacekeepers, 50,000 strong, prepared Friday to  
start moving into a Kosovo littered with land mines and other 
hazards, complications arose with Russia, which wants to be part of 
the effort but not on NATO's terms. A column of Russian troops 
entered Yugoslavia and headed toward Kosovo, surprising NATO and 
forcing the alliance to hurriedly come up with a plan for 
accommodating the Russians. 
</P>
<P>
	And those are just today's problems. Among the complications  
coming into focus for the weeks ahead: 
</P>
<P>
	-- Getting enough of a start on rebuilding the ruined homes and  
villages in Kosovo to enable the million or more ethnic Albanians 
to come home. The peacekeepers will get this long-term effort 
started, but completing it will be mainly the job of civilian 
organizations, including private relief agencies. 
</P>
<P>
	``At the moment we don't really know the full impact of the  
crisis on the homelands of Kosovars,'' the British minister for the 
armed forces, Doug Henderson, said Friday in London. ``We do know 
that it lies in ruins and we know that it will be no simple matter 
to enable the Kosovars to return home safely.'' 
</P>
<P>
	-- Disbanding the Kosovo Liberation Army, the rebel group whose  
stated aim is independence for Kosovo. NATO says it will expect the 
KLA fighters to give up their heavy weapons but not rifles and 
other light arms. The group will be ``demilitarized,'' not 
disarmed, officials say. Will the rebels go along? 
</P>
<P>
	Pentagon spokesman Kenneth Bacon said the KLA was  
``skirmishing'' with Yugoslav army troops as recently as Thursday, 
although the rebels were showing no sign of blocking Serb troop 
withdrawals Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Legal disputes. Many of the ethnic Albanians who fled Kosovo  
were stripped of their personal papers. How will NATO and the 
United Nations sort out property ownership questions once the 
refugees return? 
</P>
<P>
	The legal complications are ``enough to keep a division of  
Philadelphia lawyers busy for a decade,'' said Harry Summers, a 
retired Army colonel who writes about military affairs. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Restoring the shattered economy. The United Nations World Food  
Program says there was no agricultural harvest in Kosovo this year 
due to the fighting, and displaced Kosovars have been scavenging 
for food for weeks. The Pentagon is considering using Air Force 
C-130 transport planes to drop as many as 84,000 packaged meals a 
day into Kosovo once the NATO-led peacekeepers enter the province. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will basically enter a territory without food,'' Anna Di  
Lellio of the U.N. food agency said recently. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Autonomy for Kosovo. The NATO agreement that Yugoslav  
President Slobodan Milosevic accepted promises ``essential autonomy 
for Kosovo.'' It does not say just what that means, except that it 
should take into consideration the sovereignty and territorial 
integrity of Yugoslavia. Negotiations on this must not delay or 
disrupt establishment of ``democratic self-governing institutions'' 
in Kosovo, the agreement says. The U.N. is to oversee 
administration of Kosovo in the meantime. 
</P>
<P>
	-- War crimes. Milosevic and four top aides were indicted on war  
crime charges May 27 by a U.N. tribunal. Belgrade has dismissed the 
indictments as a ploy orchestrated by NATO. Will public pressure 
grow for NATO to round up these men? In a nationally televised 
address Thursday, Clinton warned Serbs that the United States would 
not help them rebuild from bombing ``as long as your nation is 
ruled by an indicted war criminal.''

<HEADLINE> AP Corrects Media Ruling Story </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- In a June 9 story about court action in a case  
involving NBC's ``Dateline'' show, The Associated Press erroneously 
reported that the segment in question was about the Louisiana state 
police. 
</P>
<P>
	The court case centers on whether NBC has to hand over a  
videotape made for a segment that showed a Calcasieu Parish 
sheriff's deputy stopping a car. The network was investigating 
whether law enforcement officials were making decisions based on 
race, nationality or out-of-state plates. 
</P>
<P>
	The 2nd U.S. Court of Appeals had ruled in September that NBC  
had to hand the tape over to lawyers for a Hispanic couple who are 
suing the deputy, alleging civil rights violations. The June 9 
story reported that the court had set aside that ruling, saying it 
may need to rehear that issue.

<HEADLINE> Man Opens Fire in Michigan, 3 Dead </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SOUTHFIELD, Mich. (AP) -- A gunman opened fire on his doctor and  
several other people in an office complex Friday, killing two 
people and himself. 
</P>
<P>
	Four other people were wounded. The victims were shot in or near  
the doctor's office, on the 12th floor of a large building in this 
Detroit suburb. 
</P>
<P>
	``It appears we've got a doctor-patient relationship,'' Police  
Chief Joseph Thomas said. ``We are still trying to determine why it 
happened.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He would not say whether the doctor was among the wounded.  
</P>
<P>
	Four victims were taken to a hospital. A man was in serious  
condition with a gunshot wound to the chest, and three other 
victims were being treated for wounds they received after being 
shot at close range, Dr. Peter Goodman said. 
</P>
<P>
	The building -- an office complex with at least two dozen floors  
-- was evacuated of its visitors and workers. 
</P>
<P>
	Kim Spillane, 29, said she was working on the 11th floor and did  
not hear the gunfire but saw the commotion. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just happened to look out and see all the police cars,'' she  
said. ``I ended up closing and locking our suite door,'' which she 
ultimately had barricaded with a bookcase. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were pretty scared because no one was telling us  
anything,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Miss. Gov. Announces Divorce Plans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JACKSON, Miss. (AP) -- Another day, another drama at the  
governor's mansion. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest? Gov. Kirk Fordice has ended years of speculation  
over his marriage and announced that he wants a divorce to wed a 
childhood sweetheart. The problem is that the first lady appears to 
be in no rush to end their marriage of nearly 44 years. 
</P>
<P>
	For the second time since taking office in 1991, Fordice has  
gone public with plans to divorce his wife, Pat, saying in a 
statement Thursday he wants to end their marriage ``equitably and 
with dignity.'' He said he plans to marry Ann Creson, a Memphis, 
Tenn., widow and a sweetheart from junior high, as soon as his 
divorce is final. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Fordice declined to join her husband in the announcement.  
</P>
<P>
	``Her present inclination is to not have a divorce take place  
anytime in the near future,'' said her lawyer, L.C. James. ``It is 
not fair for Gov. Fordice to call upon her to calm the storms by 
making or adopting a public announcement which runs contrary to her 
true feelings.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The governor, who earlier this week threatened a reporter who  
broached the issue, seemed irritated when asked Thursday night if 
he might resign, as some critics have suggested. 
</P>
<P>
	``Have you read the statement? Have you read the statement? It's  
self-explanatory,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Fordice, a two-term Republican who is barred by term limits from  
seeking the governorship again, is scheduled to leave office in six 
months. But in a conservative state where no sitting governor has 
divorced, some wonder whether the flap will end any time soon. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's like a soap opera,'' said Frances Fredericks, a  
Democratic state legislator. ``I think he would bring another 
(wife) in, but if justice works the way it should, he won't be able 
to before his six months is up. I hope Mrs. Fordice will do 
whatever she can to delay it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This isn't the first time the Fordices have engaged in a public  
marital tug of war. The governor first announced the collapse of 
his marriage in 1993, citing ``irreconcilable differences.'' A day 
later, Mrs. Fordice said she would continue serving as first lady 
unless forced out. They reconciled. 
</P>
<P>
	The couple became news again in 1996, when the governor was seen  
near Memphis having lunch and holding hands with a woman while Mrs. 
Fordice was n France (it was never established whether the woman 
was Ms. Creson). His whereabouts became news when Fordice, 65, was 
seriously injured in a car wreck as he headed home. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest announcement came on the heels of a report that  
Fordice vacationed in Europe last week with Ms. Creson while Mrs. 
Fordice remained in Jackson. Last month, it was revealed he bought 
a house in a Jackson suburb without inviting his wife to live 
there. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Creson did not return calls to her home on Thursday.  
</P>
<P>
	For now, the Fordices continue to live in the governor's  
mansion, according to Robbie Wilbur, Fordice's press secretary. And 
Fordice, who was a harsh critic of President Clinton's affair with 
Monica Lewinsky, continues to serve as a national co-chairman of 
Dan Quayle's presidential campaign, where family values are a 
central theme. 
</P>
<P>
	Quayle spokesman Jonathan Baron said the former vice president  
is standing behind the governor. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are pleased to have such support,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Knicks' Johnson Injures Knee </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- It should have been a joyous victory for the New  
York Knicks, an unlikely, triumphant advance to the NBA Finals. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, their 90-82 Game 6 victory over the Indiana Pacers  
Friday night was overshadowed by a frightening knee injury suffered 
by Larry Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
	Indiana's Travis Best, returning to action after missing two  
games with a groin injury, rolled into Johnson's right knee halfway 
through the second period. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson went down in a heap, grabbing his knee and screaming in  
anguish. He was immediately surrounded by teammates. After several 
minutes on the floor, he was helped off by Herb Williams and Chris 
Dudley, led into the locker room by Dr. Norman Scott, the team 
physician. 
</P>
<P>
	X-rays were negative and the preliminary diagnosis was sprained  
ligaments. Johnson was taken to a hospital for a precautionary MRI 
examination. He will be re-evaluated on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Knicks' front line is already shorthanded after Patrick  
Ewing suffered a partial tear in his left Achilles, ending his 
season after two games of the Eastern Conference finals. Ewing led 
cheers from the bench as his team closed in on the victory. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson was a vital cog in the Knicks' attack. His four-point  
play -- a 3-point field goal followed by a free throw -- with 5.7 
seconds left provided the deciding points in the Knicks' 92-91 
victory in Game 3. 
</P>
<P>
	In Game 5, Johnson hit consecutive 3-pointers down the stretch  
as New York pulled away for a 101-94 victory that put it in 
position to close out the Pacers at home. 
</P>
<P>
	When he was injured, Johnson had just scored two baskets after  
an 0-for-3 first quarter. He left the game having scored eight 
points in 14 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	New York led 28-26 when Johnson went down with his injury,  
forcing adjustments on the fly. Allan Houston turned out to be the 
difference, leading all scorers with 32 points and making basket 
after basket down the stretch. 
</P>
<P>
	Without Johnson, coach Jeff Van Gundy gave additional playing  
time to Marcus Camby, who blossomed in the Eastern Conference 
finals against Indiana. Camby scored 15 points, including two key 
foul shots in the final minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	When Chris Childs made a basket in the third quarter, he formed  
an ``L'' with his arms, the way Johnson has done throughout the 
late stages of the season and the playoffs.

<HEADLINE> House Accused of Weakening Gun Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Attorney General Janet Reno said Friday the  
House is undermining the Senate's ``common-sense'' effort to stop 
criminals from buying weapons at gun shows. 
</P>
<P>
	House legislation would narrow the definition of ``gun show''  
and restrict the time police have to complete background checks of 
prospective gun buyers who attend the events, Reno said at a weekly 
meeting with reporters at the Justice Department. 
</P>
<P>
	House legislation, to be taken up Wednesday, will not cover many  
places such as flea markets where guns are often sold. 
</P>
<P>
	``It doesn't matter to criminals if the event is called a gun  
show or a flea market -- if they can buy guns'' without a background 
check, ``they will come,'' Reno said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was very disappointed to see that'' House legislation ``has  
undermined the common-sense measures passed by the Senate to close 
the gun show loophole,'' the attorney general said. 
</P>
<P>
	The House would change the deadline for completing background  
checks to 72 hours, which the Justice Department regards as a 
crucial difference from the three ``business'' days in the Senate 
bill. Gun shows ordinarily are on weekends. 
</P>
<P>
	Record checks of courthouse files, which are closed on weekends,  
are often the only way to conclusively determine whether a person 
with an arrest record has been convicted of a crime. 
</P>
<P>
	Under legislation passed by the Senate last month, gun shows are  
broadly defined as events where a large number of guns are sold. 
The Senate bill extends the Brady law to gun shows, giving law 
enforcement the three business days many say they need to complete 
background checks. 
</P>
<P>
	Congressional Democrats and President Clinton complain that the  
National Rifle Association is writing the House's gun control bill. 
Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., and other Republicans dispute that. 
</P>
<P>
	The House is taking its turn at cracking down on juvenile  
violence two months after two high school students in Littleton, 
Colo., shot to death 12 of their classmates and a teacher before 
killing themselves.

	NEW YORK (AP) -- Former Angels manager Marcel Lachemann was hired  
Thursday as pitching coach for the United States at this summer's 
Pan Am Games, the qualifying tournament for the 2000 Sydney

<HEADLINE> St. Paul Wants To Lure Twins </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) -- St. Paul will circulate a petition  
starting Tuesday in what Mayor Norm Coleman hopes will be the start 
of a successful campaign to build a new baseball stadium to lure 
the Minnesota Twins from Minneapolis. 
</P>
<P>
	If the city collects 5,000 signatures by July 2, voters will  
decide in November whether to approve a 0.5 percent city sales tax 
increase. That would raise an estimated $10 million per year, money 
that would be combined with state and team funds for a new ballpark 
on the banks of the Mississippi River. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe that an open-air riverfront ballpark, nestled within  
a vital new urban village that creates new jobs ... is the kind of 
spark that will do great things for St. Paul,'' the mayor said. 
</P>
<P>
	If the tax hike is approved, it would be implemented only if the  
state and the Twins agree to a financing plan, and it would end 
after the city's share of the funding is reached. 
</P>
<P>
	Minneapolis and Hennepin County officials announced their own  
joint plan to build a stadium in Minneapolis. That proposal would 
increase the county sales tax by 0.5 percent to raise money for a 
Twins ballpark and, possibly, a stadium for the Vikings and Golden 
Gophers. 
</P>
<P>
	Coleman said earlier this week that Twins owner Carl Pohlad must  
decide whether to back the St. Paul plan before officials can 
proceed. On Friday, however, he said Pohlad will need to take a 
stand ``by the time the voters go to the polls'' during the 
November general election. 
</P>
<P>
	Coleman's plan would require a $100 million contribution from  
the state, but he refused to speculate on how that money would be 
raised until voters decide whether to proceed with the sales tax. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the plan offered by Minneapolis and Hennepin County  
officials, the state would not be asked to provide any direct 
funding. But since legislative approval is required for local 
governments to raise taxes, Coleman said his plan is the more 
palatable of the two because voters get to have a say. 
</P>
<P>
	The Minneapolis/Hennepin County plan suffered a setback Friday  
when the city council failed on a 6-6 vote to back a resolution 
supporting the effort. One council member was absent, and the 
resolution will be reconsidered at the council's next meeting in 
two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Gov. Jesse Ventura also reiterated his opposition to any public  
funding during his inaugural ``Lunch with the Governor'' radio show 
Friday on WCCO. But while he said he is ``reluctant to build a new 
stadium,'' he added that he will listen to public sentiment.

<HEADLINE> Blue Jays' Green Returns to Lineup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Toronto Blue Jay center fielder Shawn Green  
returned to the starting lineup Friday night against the 
Philadelphia Phillies after missing most of two weeks because of an 
injured left wrist. 
</P>
<P>
	Green sustained a fracture when he was hit by New York Yankees  
pitcher Andy Pettitte on May 28. Despite the injury, Green did not 
spend any time on the disabled list. 
</P>
<P>
	He started against the Montreal Expos on June 4 but left after  
four innings due to soreness in the wrist. Five days later, he made 
an appearance as a pinch runner against the New York Mets. 
</P>
<P>
	Green, tied for second in the American League with 33 extra-base  
hits and tied for fifth with 23 multihit games, batted third 
against the Phillies. 
</P>
<P>
	``He hit early today and said he felt fine,'' Toronto manager  
Jim Fregosi said. ``He has to expect some soreness and stuff.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Green was hitting .322 with 15 homers and 48 RBIs before the  
injury. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope he can play through it and be productive at the same  
time,'' Fregosi said. ``I told him not to expect miracles.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Green had played in a team-high 155 consecutive games before  
missing a start on May 29 against the Yankees.

<HEADLINE> Ex-NBA Player Sought in Shooting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Dontae' Jones, who played briefly in the  
NBA after leading Mississippi State to the Final Four, was arrested 
Friday in connection with a shooting that wounded seven people. 
</P>
<P>
	The shooting took place April 25 outside a nightclub called the  
Players Draft House. 
</P>
<P>
	A second suspect, Karshma Dardy, was arrested Thursday and  
charged with reckless endangerment and felony vandalism. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones, who turned himself in to Nashville Police about 1 p.m.  
Friday, faces the same charges, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	The gunfire was the result of an argument between a Memphis rap  
group and an entertainment promoter at the night spot, according to 
police reports. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones, who grew up in Nashville, was the junior college player  
of the year after averaging 28.7 points and 13.3 rebounds for 
Northeast Mississippi Community College during the 1994-95 season. 
</P>
<P>
	He played one season at Mississippi State, averaging 14.7  
points. He was the MVP of the Southeastern Conference tournament 
after Mississippi State upset Kentucky and led the Bulldogs to the 
Final Four where they lost to Syracuse in the national semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones left college after his junior year and was a first-round  
draft pick of the New York Knicks. He had foot surgery shortly 
after the draft and did not play that season. 
</P>
<P>
	Traded to Boston, Jones played in 15 games for the Celtics in  
the 1998 season, averaging 2.9 points. 
</P>
<P>
	He was waived by the Celtics prior to the start of the 1999  
season. 
</P>
<P>
	Players Draft House security guard Darryl L. Tyce told  
authorities he witnessed Jones and Dardy firing handguns in his 
direction. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyce was wounded in the stomach and his car was damaged.

<HEADLINE> Cathay Flights Still Not Fully Normal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- Despite a new pay deal between Cathay Pacific  
Airways and its pilots, Hong Kong's flagship carrier canceled more 
than half its flights Friday as the airline worked to rebuild 
operations after a two-week sickout. 
</P>
<P>
	Cathay said the number of pilots calling in sick has gone down,  
but the airline had to cancel 69 of its 118 flights Friday. Cathay 
hired other airlines to fly 52 services on a charter basis to help 
keep passengers in the air. 
</P>
<P>
	Cathay spokeswoman Quince Chong said the airline was hoping to  
dispense with the chartered flights by late next week. 
</P>
<P>
	A two-week sickout of pilots claiming they were too stressed to  
fly crippled Asia's third largest airline, grounding hundreds of 
flights and affecting more than 85,000 passengers. 
</P>
<P>
	Late Thursday, Cathay and the cockpit crew reached an agreement  
for highly paid senior pilots to have their salaries cut by an 
average 7 percent, while junior pilots would see raises of up to 5 
percent over the next three years. 
</P>
<P>
	Cathay said it needs pay cuts to return to profitability after  
being hammered by losses last year during Asia's economic crisis. 
The company persuaded flight attendants to agree to concessions 
earlier in the year.

<HEADLINE> Wal-Mart Shooting Kills Two </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MADISON, Wis. (AP) -- A man killed one person and wounded another  
outside a Wal-Mart store Friday before shooting himself to death, 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
	At least two of the three knew each other, and the shooting may  
have involved a domestic dispute, police spokesman Dave Gouran 
said, without giving any details or the identities of those 
involved. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities did not know if any of the victims worked at the  
store, dispatcher Chas Kalauer said. 
</P>
<P>
	Store customers were told to stay inside after the shooting,  
said Molly Rogers, who was waiting to retrieve her van. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were in there maybe 10 minutes when we heard, `Attention  
Wal-Mart shoppers, due to uncontrollable circumstances do not leave 
the store,''' Rogers said.

<HEADLINE> Online Auction Site Back On Line </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- MarGee Charlier knew her business was in  
trouble when she logged in and saw that eBay, the wildly popular 
online auction site, had crashed. 
</P>
<P>
	``Devastation,'' she said. ``Disaster.''  
</P>
<P>
	Charlier supports her small business in Kewaunee, Wis., by  
selling between 50 to 100 antiques -- bringing in between $2,000 and 
$4,000 -- each day through the site. But not on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	All bidding was suspended at eBay as the so-called ``personal  
trading community'' with more than 3 million users in 50 countries 
struggled to rebuild a corrupted computer server. Bidding stopped 
Thursday night and didn't begin again until Friday, some 22 hours 
later. 
</P>
<P>
	EBay is the world's largest online auction site, with more than  
2 million items listed at any time. In an average minute on eBay, 
more than 150 new items are listed, 500 bids are placed and seven 
new people register. Its Web site receives more than 600 million 
hits a month. 
</P>
<P>
	The halt, which came after eBay tried to launch a revamped  
version of its site, disrupted bidding on millions of collectibles 
and curios. 
</P>
<P>
	After the site returned, a message from company founder Pierre  
Omidyar and chief executive officer Meg Whitman promised a new 
backup system that would limit future outages to no more than an 
hour. 
</P>
<P>
	Auctions also were extended by two days and the company said it  
would refund fees for all active auctions from Thursday and Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are sorry,'' the message said. ``We know that you expect  
uninterrupted service from eBay. We believe that this is 
reasonable, and we know we haven't lived up to your expectations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The outage was unrelated to the Worm.Explore.Zip computer bug,  
which began infecting systems across the country this week. 
</P>
<P>
	Apologies weren't worth much to Sharon Doney in Severn, Md., who  
is trying to raise $250,000 through online auctions of records and 
books to cover medical bills for her failing liver. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is frustrating,'' she said. ``Say you were at a real  
auction and the auctioneer just walked away for a while. It just 
doesn't work.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Doney said that problems on eBay -- short crashes, slowdowns and  
postponed auction endings -- during the past few months have already 
prompted her to branch out into other auction sites, including eBay 
competitors Amazon.com and Yahoo! 
</P>
<P>
	One of eBay's worst previous outages, which lasted about six  
hours, prevented the company from holding auctions of just-released 
merchandise tied to the latest ``Star Wars'' movie. 
</P>
<P>
	Andrew Bartels, senior research analyst at Cambridge,  
Mass.-based Giga Information Group, said outages should be 
expected: ``This is still new technology and these high transaction 
sites will periodically go down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bartels said that eBay traders have less to lose than online  
stock brokers, who have also experienced site crashes in recent 
weeks.

<HEADLINE> Abu-Jamal Protested at Commencement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OLYMPIA, Wash. (AP) -- Several students walked out of their  
college commencement Friday and some stood with their backs to the 
stage to protest the inclusion of convicted cop killer Mumia 
Abu-Jamal as a speaker. 
</P>
<P>
	Protesters, including police officers in dress uniforms, walked  
out of the Evergreen State College commencement when Abu-Jamal's 
audiotaped remarks were played. 
</P>
<P>
	A handful of about 800 graduating seniors wearing blue armbands  
also walked out, while two dozen others stood and turned their 
backs during the 13-minute speech. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel what's going on here does not represent who I am and  
why I'm here,'' said Shawn Ward, one of the graduates who walked 
out. 
</P>
<P>
	One protester had a replica of an electric chair and a sign  
reading: ``A positive role model for Mumia.'' The protesters 
included Maureen Faulkner, the widow of the Philadelphia police 
officer Abu-Jamal is accused of shooting in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
	Abu-Jamal's participation, she said, was ``not fitting for a  
graduation ceremony. A classroom, maybe, but not a graduation 
ceremony.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Evergreen permits its student to select commencement speakers.  
Abu-Jamal was among several people nominated for inclusion, and was 
selected along with other speakers at a meeting open to all 
students. 
</P>
<P>
	A student, Malka Fenyvesi, said Abu-Jamal was not invited to  
cause pain for Ms. Faulkner or ``to create a lot of bad feelings,'' 
but rather to create a forum for a ``marginalized segment of our 
society.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Abu-Jamal has been on death row since 1982. No execution date  
has been set. He is appealing to the U.S. Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
	Abu-Jamal's jailhouse writings about the justice system -- and  
efforts to win a new trial -- have given him worldwide attention. A 
symbol for death penalty opponents, he contends he is innocent and 
his conviction due to a biased judge and an ineffective attorney. 
</P>
<P>
	Some seniors showed up wearing yellow armbands in support of  
Abu-Jamal. 
</P>
<P>
	``Why was it right for people to revolt against the British  
because of taxation without representation and somehow wrong for 
truly unrepresented Africans in America to revolt against 
America?'' the former Black Panther said in remarks played to 
several thousand people. 
</P>
<P>
	``For any repressed people, revolution, according to the  
Declaration of Independence, is a right,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Evergreen President Jane Jervis told the crowd before  
Abu-Jamal's remarks were played that people should ``be aware of 
the pain and outrage'' of Ms. Faulkner and police officers, and of 
the right of diverse voices to be heard. 
</P>
<P>
	Abu-Jamal's participation prompted Gov. Gary Locke to cancel his  
appearance at the ceremony.

<HEADLINE> Orlando's Hardaway Now a Free Agent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Four-time NBA all-star Penny Hardaway exercised an option to  
void the last three years of his contract with the Orlando Magic 
and will become a free agent on July 1. 
</P>
<P>
	Hardaway, who averaged 15.8 points, 5.7 rebounds and 5.3 assists  
this season, complained after an early playoff exit that he was 
underappreciated and said a change of scenery seemed like a logical 
solution. 
</P>
<P>
	``As expected, Penny has exercised his option,'' general manager  
John Gabriel said Friday. ``We will see what the future holds. We 
would like to re-sign him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A telephone message left at the office of Carl Posten,  
Hardaway's Houston-based attorney, was not immediately returned. 
</P>
<P>
	Hardaway helped the Magic compile the second-best record in the  
Eastern Conference during the lockout-shortened regular season, 
however he struggled in the playoffs and felt fans and the media 
targeted him as a scapegoat. 
</P>
<P>
	``I never thought it would come down to this in Orlando. I  
wanted to finish my career here, but it seems like it's just too 
rocky right now,'' the sixth-year pro said the day after the Magic 
were eliminated from the playoffs by the Philadelphia 76ers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I like Orlando. I really do. But it has to be mutual,'' he  
said. ``Right now, I feel like I'm in a very tough situation. 
There's a lot of added pressure on me that shouldn't be there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hardaway apologized for the comments the following day.  
</P>
<P>
	Drafted as a point guard when Orlando's offense was centered  
around Shaquille O'Neal, the Magic became more dependent on 
Hardaway's scoring after the center left for the Los Angeles Lakers 
in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Hardaway appeared in every game after missing most of the past  
two seasons because of injuries. But he complained at times about 
not being able to get enough shots at point guard. 
</P>
<P>
	Hardaway was due $26 million over the last three years of his  
current contract. The most he could earn in a new deal would $85 
million over seven years, although just two teams -- Orlando and 
Chicago, which has lots of room under the salary, -- could offer a 
package in that range. 
</P>
<P>
	One option available to Hardaway if he is determined to not play  
in Orlando again is a sign-and-trade deal, in which he agrees to 
terms with Orlando and is traded to another team. 
</P>
<P>
	Hardaway played a major role in the firing of former coach Brian  
Hill in 1997 and also had his differences with Chuck Daly, who 
retired last month. 
</P>
<P>
	The Magic hired Doc Rivers to succeed Daly last Monday, and the  
new coach said he would welcome Hardaway back next season if that's 
what the star guard wants. 
</P>
<P>
	``I consider Penny a part of this organization. The key for us  
is we want to make sure he wants to be here,'' Rivers said. ``He's 
had his ups and downs. The one thing that no one questions is his 
talent.''

<HEADLINE> Garden Nightmare Sends Pacers Home </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The Indiana Pacers' championship mission failed  
again, stalled this time in the face of Spike Lee and the city they 
love to hate. 
</P>
<P>
	They've got to be getting sick of this by now.  
</P>
<P>
	Thought to be the team to beat in this post-Michael Jordan,  
lockout-shortened season, the Pacers were thwarted again Friday 
night with a 90-82 loss to the New York Knicks that might have 
surpassed the crushing devastation that Jordan and the Bulls 
inflicted on them last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Or maybe it was even worse.  
</P>
<P>
	``You can't compare this to losing to Chicago, because they were  
one of the best teams ever,'' Pacers point guard Mark Jackson said. 
``We're going home -- no disrespect to them -- but knowing that we 
feel we're the better team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the '90s, the Pacers have all the pride, experience and  
show-stopping qualities needed for thrilling postseason runs. In 
short, they have everything but rings; in fact, not even a trip to 
the NBA Finals. 
</P>
<P>
	Facing elimination at Madison Square Garden, the Pacers were  
whistled into oblivion as Reggie Miller had only eight points to go 
with five fouls. Rik Smits fouled out with 20 points, and Jackson 
committed five personals and scored 14 points. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall, the Pacers were called for 35 fouls, and the Knicks 16.  
New York shot 33 free throws, making 27. The Pacers were 9-for-9. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you have several guys picking up four or five fouls and  
one guy fouling out,'' said Jackson, his voice trailing off. 
``Let's just hope the NBA Finals is a great series. They got what 
they wanted.'' 
</P>
<P>
	During his Hall of Fame playing career with the Boston Celtics,  
Pacers coach Larry Bird was the beneficiary of foul calls. With 
``Larry Legend'' in a suit on the sideline, it was a different 
story. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a tough deal when you play against New York,'' Bird said.  
``It's New York. You know you're not going to get a lot of calls.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Pacers completed their Garden nightmare with 27 turnovers  
resulting in 26 points by the Knicks. As a result, the Pacers are 
0-4 in the Eastern Conference finals during their impressive but 
still undecorated run of success this decade. 
</P>
<P>
	What happens now? A year older, and with another crushing defeat  
on their collective conscience, do the Pacers stay together and 
make another run? 
</P>
<P>
	``I love this team,'' forward Antonio Davis said. ``I love the  
guys. I think we can get it done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When they lost to the Bulls in seven games in the conference  
finals last summer, the Pacers vowed to carry Jordan's torch and 
win the first championship after his retirement. They practiced 
together during the lockout, reminded themselves all season that 
nothing less than a championship would do. 
</P>
<P>
	They are right back where they started. This time, it was the  
Knicks showing them the way back to Indiana -- for the third time in 
five playoff series between the rivals. 
</P>
<P>
	``The guys were counting on me to put them on my backs, and I  
didn't do it this time,'' said Miller, whose long face contorted 
into an expression of disbelief when he picked up those two fouls. 
``I have to take responsibility for that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Pacers' nerves never frayed, their determination didn't  
falter even when Miller picked up his third and fourth fouls in a 
span of 13 seconds with less than five minutes left in the third. 
With Miller on the bench, Jalen Rose took his customary spot in 
Lee's corner of the Garden, the 31st Street and Seventh Avenue 
corner, to hit several clutch shots that kept them in the game. 
</P>
<P>
	Miller picked up those two crucial fouls while trying -- and  
failing -- to guard New York's Allan Houston, who had 32 points. 
Then, when New York took a four-point lead, and then a six-point 
lead down the stretch, Miller missed the kind of backbreaking shots 
he's come to personify in this building. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked to describe his shooting, Miller said simply,  
``Horrendous. Horrendous.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The last miss came with the clock ticking inside 30 seconds.  
</P>
<P>
	Now, start the clock on the Pacers' offseason.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Panel OKs Tariff on Japan Steel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- U.S. steel producers won a crucial ruling  
Friday when the U.S. International Trade Commission approved 
punitive tariffs to combat low-priced Japanese shipments. 
</P>
<P>
	Tariffs ranging from 18 percent to 67 percent will be ordered by  
the Clinton administration within weeks. Those tariffs will 
effectively make Japanese steel more expensive to sell in the 
United States, offering domestic producers some relief. 
</P>
<P>
	The trade commission ruled 6-0 that Japanese pricing practices  
on hot-rolled carbon steel, the industry's main product, have or 
could hurt domestic producers. The Commerce Department previously 
declared the pricing illegal. 
</P>
<P>
	Curtis H. Barnette, chairman and chief executive of Bethlehem  
Steel Corp., considered the ruling a vindication for the industry, 
which blames low-priced imports for thousands of layoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	But he said tariffs are not a cure-all. The U.S. industry has  
been pushing for stronger sanctions, such as quotas covering all 
steel products from all countries. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is just a further step in a lengthy process needed to end  
our crisis in the industry,'' Barnette said. ``The vote clearly 
demonstrates the serious injury we have been sustaining, but our 
problems continue.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The import surge last year came in the wake of the Asian  
economic crisis, which lowered demand for steel abroad and forced 
foreign producers to turn to the healthier U.S. economy. 
</P>
<P>
	The tariffs, which will be made retroactive to February, will  
likely be in place at least five years. 
</P>
<P>
	Japanese steel producers blamed politics for the ruling.  
</P>
<P>
	``We are disappointed that a majority of the commissioners,  
facing overwhelming political pressure, ignored the facts and 
imposed long-term restrictions on hot-rolled steel imports,'' said 
Hidenori Tazawa, executive vice president for NKK America Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the tariffs ``will raise prices and limit supply  
availability and choice for U.S. steel users.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Another executive, Masaki Sato of Nippon Steel U.S.A. Inc., said  
earlier that his company is likely to appeal to the U.S. Court of 
International Trade in New York. The court handles disputed cases 
from the trade commission, a fact-finding agency independent from 
the administration. 
</P>
<P>
	Hot-rolled steel can be used as is in such applications as  
construction or turned into higher-grade products for appliances or 
automobiles. 
</P>
<P>
	Friday's ruling would not apply to other steel products or to  
other countries. Hot-rolled shipments from Japan already have gone 
down to almost insignificant levels partly because of the threat of 
tariffs, so the vote was mostly about sustaining those reductions. 
</P>
<P>
	Supporters of global quotas are hoping for a Senate vote on the  
issue later this month. The House overwhelmingly passed a quota 
bill in March by a 289-141 vote, despite the threat of a 
presidential veto. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. industry accused Japanese, Russian and Brazilian  
producers of illegally dumping hot-rolled steel in the United 
States at prices below production costs or home-market prices. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration has tentatively struck deals with  
Russia and Brazil in which those countries could avoid tariffs by 
voluntarily reducing steel shipments. 
</P>
<P>
	The foreign producers argued that the pricing trends result from  
normal market forces. They added that the U.S. industry's claims of 
harm were exaggerated because profitability and production declines 
last year followed one of the industry's best years ever.

<HEADLINE> Celtics Dominate Nominees for Hall </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SPRINGFIELD, Mass. (AP) -- The Boston Celtics, the most dominant  
team in NBA history, dominated this year's nominations to the 
Basketball Hall of Fame. 
</P>
<P>
	Six of 13 candidates announced Thursday played for the Celtics:  
Kevin McHale, Dennis Johnson, Jo Jo White, Wayne Embry, Bob McAdoo 
and retired Georgetown coach John Thompson, who was a backup center 
for Bill Russell on the 1965 and 1966 championship teams. 
</P>
<P>
	``They did so much! How could you leave them out?'' said Red  
Auerbach, who coached the Celtics to nine titles from 1957-1966. 
</P>
<P>
	The Celtics have won 16 NBA titles, more than any other team,  
and 25 players, coaches and others connected to the Celtics already 
are in the Hall of Fame. 
</P>
<P>
	McHale and Johnson were teammates on the Larry Bird-led Boston  
teams that won NBA championships in 1984 and 1986. McHale also 
played on the Celtics' championship team in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
	Brought to the Celtics in 1980 with Robert Parish, McHale at  
first was the team's sixth man. The 6-foot-10 forward went on to 
play 12 seasons on a front line with Parish and Bird. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was so good, and he improved his game so much,'' Auerbach  
said. ``Originally, he was just in the pivot and after a while, he 
started to move around and developed a real good outside shot.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In 1985, McHale set a Celtics record by scoring 56 points  
against the Detroit Pistons. Bird broke the record nine days later 
with 60 against the Atlanta Hawks. 
</P>
<P>
	McHale averaged 17.9 points and 7.3 rebounds in his career, and  
was a 55 percent shooter from the field. He made seven All-Star 
teams and was three-time selection to the All-NBA defensive team. 
</P>
<P>
	Bird once said McHale ``never saw a triple-team he didn't  
like.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Thompson coached Georgetown for 27 years before leaving the job  
in January. His teams went 596-239, made the NCAA tournament 14 
straight times, played in three Final Fours and won the national 
championship in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
	White was sweet-shooting guard who won two championships with  
the Celtics and an Olympic gold medal in 1968. Embry played on 
Boston's 1968 title team. 
</P>
<P>
	McAdoo played in only 20 games for the Celtics, in the 1978-79  
season. The three-time league scoring champion played on two 
championship teams with the Los Angeles Lakers. 
</P>
<P>
	The other nominees are:  
</P>
<P>
	-- Maurice Cheeks, a slick guard for the 1983 NBA champion  
Philadelphia 76ers who was the league's career steals leader when 
he retired. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Gus Johnson, a power forward for the Baltimore Bullets who  
died of brain cancer in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Sidney Moncrief, a two-time NBA defensive player of the year  
for the Milwaukee Bucks in the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Chet Walker, a forward on Philadelphia's 1967 championship  
team. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Mount St. Mary's coach Jim Phelan, the winningest active  
college coach. His career record is 800-442. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Tex Winter, an assistant Chicago Bulls coach who has spent 52  
seasons as a college and pro coach. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Morgan Wootten, the coach at DeMatha High School in  
Washington, D.C., whose record of 1,185-178 is the best ever for a 
high school coach. 
</P>
<P>
	This year's Hall of Famers will be announced June 21. For  
enshrinement, a nominee needs 18 of 24 votes from an Honors 
Committee of Hall of Famers, basketball officials, journalists and 
others.

<HEADLINE> Gooden Hits First Homer Since '93 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- Dwight Gooden, who had a team-record seven  
homers during his career with the New York Mets, hit a two-run 
homer Friday night against the Cincinnati Reds. 
</P>
<P>
	Gooden, the leading home-run hitter among active pitchers, got  
his first since 1993 and put the Cleveland Indians ahead 3-0 in the 
second inning. 
</P>
<P>
	Gooden set a Mets record with his seventh homer on July 1, 1993,  
off Florida's Charlie Hough. Tom Seaver had held the previous Mets' 
record for homers by a pitcher with six. 
</P>
<P>
	Gooden had a .196 career average when he came to bat Friday  
night and pulled a 2-1 pitch from Steve Parris over the wall in 
left-center for his eighth career homer. Parris angrily yanked off 
his own cap and muttered to himself after the ball cleared the 
wall. 
</P>
<P>
	The homer extended a notable Indians' streak. Their last homer  
by a pitcher also came in Cincinnati, where Dave Burba hit one off 
Scott Klingenbeck last June 7. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997, Bobby Witt hit the only other homer by a pitcher in  
interleague play.

<HEADLINE> Iran Spy Suspects Could Face Death </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) -- The head of Iran's judiciary  
said Friday that 13 Iranian Jews held on charges of spying for 
Israel and the United States could face the death penalty, the 
Islamic Republic News Agency reported. 
</P>
<P>
	``The laws (in Iran) have their own prescriptions which at  
certain instances provide for the capital punishment of spies,'' 
IRNA quoted Ayatollah Mohammad Yazdi as telling thousands of 
worshippers attending Friday prayers at Tehran University. 
</P>
<P>
	``Justice would be done on all members of the group, even (if it  
means) they should receive capital punishment,'' Yazdi was quoted 
as saying by the agency, monitored in Dubai. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. and Israeli officials have called for the immediate release  
of the 13, saying the charges were unfounded. 
</P>
<P>
	Yazdi dismissed the criticism.  
</P>
<P>
	``We interpret your unhappiness with us as proof of our  
intellectual maturity. You will be happy with us once we agree to 
(be) your slaves, but Iran is an independent country and will not 
surrender to you,'' Yazdi added, according to the agency.

<HEADLINE> Midsized Japanese Bank Fails </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japan's Tokyo Sowa Bank Ltd., a midsized regional  
bank, asked financial authorities to declare it insolvent. 
</P>
<P>
	The bank said Friday it made the request to the Financial  
Reconstruction Committee after fund-raising became difficult and 
the bank feared it would be unable to repay depositors. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier Friday, it revised its results for the fiscal year that  
ended March 31 to show liabilities exceeding assets by about $8.6 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Tokyo Sowa also said that its capital adequacy ratio -- a measure  
of a bank's health -- was minus 5.60 percent at the end of March 
versus a positive 2.42 percent in late May. 
</P>
<P>
	Since Japanese banks with only domestic operations are required  
to have a capital adequacy ratio of at least 4 percent, the 
Financial Supervisory Agency on May 31 ordered the bank to take 
``prompt corrective action'' to increase its capital. 
</P>
<P>
	The bank said it intended to boost its capital via a third-party  
share issue. However, after the FSA order, depositors rushed to 
close their accounts, making fund-raising impossible, Tokyo Sowa 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The bank's board of directors will resign to take responsibility  
for its failure.

<HEADLINE> `New' American Solis Rides 4 Winners </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INGLEWOOD, Calif. (AP) -- Alex Solis, sworn in as an American  
citizen on Thursday, celebrated Friday by riding four winners at 
Hollywood Park, including Aviate in the feature race. 
</P>
<P>
	Solis, a 35-year-old native of Panama, also won with Tanaasa in  
the second race, Bacavi in the fourth and Rock Hound in the fifth 
race. 
</P>
<P>
	Aviate, the 2-5 favorite, took the lead midway through the  
stretch in beating Nausicaa by three lengths in the $51,352 
allowance feature for 3-year-old fillies. 
</P>
<P>
	Aviate, who carried 119 pounds, covered 1 1-16 miles on turf in  
1:41 1-5 and paid $2.80 and $2.10. There was no show betting 
because only four fillies competed. 
</P>
<P>
	The victory was the third in 10 lifetime starts for Aviate and  
was worth $31,440, increasing the career earnings of the 
Kentucky-bred daughter of Lord Avie to $169,842. 
</P>
<P>
	Nausicaa, ridden by Brice Blanc and carrying 117 pounds, crossed  
the finish line 3 1/2 lengths in front of Courtesan and returned

<HEADLINE> Japanese Stocks Close Higher / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- The yen gained moderately against the dollar in  
Tokyo today, boosted by signs of revival in the Japanese economy. 
Stocks also edged up. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 118.66 yen today, down 0.46 yen from late  
Thursday in Tokyo and below its late New York level of 118.84 yen 
overnight. The greenback ranged between 118.60 yen and 119.09 yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The gains for the yen came after the Economic Planning Agency's  
announcement Thursday that Japan's economy grew 1.9 percent, or 7.9 
percent on an annualized basis, in the first quarter of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	The numbers marked Japan's first expansion after five quarters  
of contraction. The country is struggling with its deepest 
recession since the end of World War II. 
</P>
<P>
	``There has been a shift in sentiment regarding the Japanese  
economy,'' said Ken Landon, senior currency strategist at Deutsche 
Bank in Tokyo. ``The change in pace is quite dramatic ... and 
people are starting to wake up to that fact.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Currency traders also said they were assessing what the  
yen-selling action by the Bank of Japan on Thursday afternoon means 
for the market's mid-term direction. The intervention followed the 
announcement of new GDP figures. 
</P>
<P>
	Japanese officials recently have expressed dissatisfaction with  
dollar-yen volatility. The greenback was worth more than 122 yen at 
the beginning of this month, but then dropped as low as 117.63 yen 
after the release of Thursday's economic data. 
</P>
<P>
	According to a market estimate, the Bank of Japan spent about  
dlrs 1 billion in the intervention Thursday, the Nihon Keizai 
newspaper said. The central bank last intervened on Jan. 12 in 
Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	Stocks also benefited from the signs of economic growth.  
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average gained 95.93  
points, or 0.56 percent, to close at 17,198.55. On Thursday, the 
average finished up 480.12 points, or 2.89 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section closed up 13.07 points, or 0.96 percent, at 1,380.68 
points. The TOPIX was up 25.10 points, or 1.87 percent, on 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Overseas money came in pretty actively today,'' said Chuck  
Lambert, a market analyst at Jardine Fleming Securities. ``Things 
may have bottomed out and are turning around.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Advancing issues outnumbered retreaters 696 to 526, while 102  
issues were unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	First Section volume was estimated at 1.66 billion shares,  
inflated by the settlement of June futures and options contracts, 
which did not seem to have a major impact on prices. On Thursday, 
volume was 713 million shares. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies today, the euro was traded at 124.70 yen,  
down from 125.11 yen late Thursday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark No. 213 10-year Japanese government bond rose to  
1.7000 percent from Thursday's finish of 1.5900 percent, driving 
its price down to 97.43 yen from 98.36 yen.

<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The New York Mets honored former Red Sox great  
Ted Williams on Friday night in celebration of the 60th anniversary 
of the Hall of Famer's rookie season. 
</P>
<P>
	Hall of Famers Tom Seaver, Yogi Berra and Ralph Kiner, as well  
as many of Williams' former teammates, were on hand for the 
ceremony before Friday night's game between the Mets and Red Sox. 
</P>
<P>
	``You set an example for all of us who played and still set an  
example for those who play now. You are the greatest,'' Kiner said 
before presenting Williams with a silver bat. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams, still recovering from a stroke, made his brief remarks  
from a golf cart on the pitcher's mound, while players from both 
teams stood attentively on the baselines. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been lucky in my days in baseball,'' Williams said.  
</P>
<P>
	He was helped out of the cart by Tom Seaver and Rusty Staub  
before throwing the ceremonial first pitch to Mike Piazza.

<HEADLINE> Marlins, Counsell Part Ways </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- The Florida Marlins parted company Friday with 1997  
World Series hero Craig Counsell, and he was glad to go. 
</P>
<P>
	Counsell complained this week about his shrinking role on the  
team, and the Marlins responded by designating his contract for 
assignment. The move removed Counsell from the roster, and if the 
Marlins are unable to trade him in 10 days, he'll be placed on 
waivers. 
</P>
<P>
	General manager Dave Dombrowski said Counsell's complaints in a  
meeting with manager John Boles prompted the move. 
</P>
<P>
	``His comments to Bolesy sped things up with some of the things  
he said,'' Dombrowski said. ``He's a first-class individual, but 
sometimes even first-class individuals get frustrated.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Counsell, a fan favorite who lost his starting job at second  
base in spring training to Luis Castillo, said leaving the Marlins 
was what he wanted. 
</P>
<P>
	``I need a new start,'' he said. ``I need to go somewhere  
else.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Counsell scored the winning run in the 1997 World Series, but he  
started just 10 games this year and had a .152 average in 66 
at-bats. He took his frustration public and met with Boles after 
being taken out of a game Tuesday in the eighth inning for 
defensive reasons. 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe some of my emotions boiled over,'' Counsell said. ``I  
regret feeling like maybe I was a jerk in that situation, but at 
the same time, you've got to fight for yourself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Said Boles: ``I feel very sad about it. He's just a tremendous  
guy -- exactly how you'd like your sons to grow up. You wish him the 
best.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Counsell's departure leaves the Marlins with just three  
holdovers from the 1997 World Series roster -- Livan Hernandez, 
Cliff Floyd and Antonio Alfonseca. Alex Fernandez, who missed the 
series because of an injury, also remains with Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	To fill Counsell's spot on the roster, the Marlins purchased the  
contract of outfielder Danny Bautista from Triple-A Calgary. 
Bautista, 27, is a .232 career hitter in six seasons with Detroit 
and Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	Counsell said he's certain he'll wind up with another major  
league team, but the Marlins aren't so sure. Dombrowski has been 
trying to swing a trade ever since Counsell lost his starting job, 
but there's apparently not much demand for a 28-year-old second 
baseman who hit .251 last year and has little power or speed. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sometimes deals aren't just there to be made,'' Dombrowski  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Dombrowski said the Marlins won't release Counsell. That means  
he could wind up with their Triple-A affiliate in Calgary, or in 
the minor leagues with another organization. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've got to get my career going again,'' Counsell said. ``I  
have no doubt I'll land on my feet and help somebody.''

<HEADLINE> Americans Favor 1st Lady Senate Run </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Three of four Americans think it's OK for a  
president's spouse to run for office, and more than half say 
Hillary Rodham Clinton should run for the U.S. Senate in New York, 
according to an Associated Press poll. 
</P>
<P>
	Three-quarters of Democrats were in favor of a Senate campaign  
by Mrs. Clinton, but so were half of independent voters and one in 
three Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
	The proportion of people who said she should run, 54 percent,  
was sharply lower than the 73 percent who said a president's spouse 
could appropriately run for office. But that difference was largely 
due to the attitudes of GOP voters. 
</P>
<P>
	The poll, conducted by ICR of Media, Pa., found that 65 percent  
of Republicans said seeking elective office was appropriate for a 
presidential spouse, while 34 percent said this particular 
president's wife should run. Among Democrats, 85 percent said 
running for office was appropriate in general, and 77 percent said 
Mrs. Clinton should run. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton recently said she would form an exploratory  
committee to help her decide whether to seek the Senate seat held 
by Democrat Daniel Patrick Moynihan, who is retiring. She is 
running neck and neck with New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, a 
Republican, in polls of New York voters. 
</P>
<P>
	Elizabeth Dole, a candidate for the GOP presidential nomination  
and wife of 1996 Republican nominee Bob Dole, said in an interview 
with The Associated Press this week that Mrs. Clinton should be 
able to run ``if that's what she wants to do and if the people of 
New York want her to do it. ... She's certainly a very bright lady. 
That's up to her.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The telephone poll of 1,016 American adults was taken Friday  
through Tuesday. The margin of sampling error was plus or minus 3 
percentage points. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton's approval rating stood at 58 percent in the poll.  
President Clinton got a mixed review, with 48 percent saying they 
had a favorable opinion of him and 44 percent saying their opinion 
was unfavorable. 
</P>
<P>
	``She's qualified, a smart lady. She's gone to law school. She's  
got a lot of ideas and had some nice health ideas,'' said Andrew 
Eckman, a 46-year-old manager of a comedy basketball team in 
Springfield, Mass. ``I pursue my dreams. She should be able to.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But some who thought it was appropriate for a president's spouse  
to run for office didn't want Mrs. Clinton to run for the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	``If a person grew up in a state and then came back and wanted  
to run, that would be OK,'' said Leo Wiser, a 44-year-old carpenter 
in North Charleston, S.C., who was born near Binghamton, N.Y. 
``Every time I've heard Mrs. Clinton asked about what's going on in 
New York, she gravitates towards the city. I wonder if maybe she 
should try for representative of the city.'' 
</P>
<P>
	New York polls have shown that about half the people in the  
state are at least somewhat concerned that she is not a New Yorker, 
said Lee Miringoff, director of the Marist Institute for Public 
Opinion. 
</P>
<P>
	The sentiment for Mrs. Clinton to run and the number who think  
it is appropriate for a president's spouse to run dropped for 
respondents 55 and older. 
</P>
<P>
	``She should be a writer and lecturer,'' said Elizabeth  
Smothers, a 57-year-old Republican from Boaz, Ala. ``She'd be out 
there for everybody who wanted to pay to see her, but I would never 
have to hear from her again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	About one-third of those polled said they thought Mrs. Clinton  
would be most effective as a senator, with the remainder divided on 
whether she would have more influence as the head of a foundation, 
writer and lecturer or lawyer. Women and people with lower incomes 
were more likely to think senator would be her most effective role.	   Mrs. Clinton's campaign would be ``so unique that I don't think 
it will tell us anything generally about women in politics,'' said 
Jean Bethke Elshtain, a professor of social and political ethics at 
the University of Chicago and specialist on women in politics. 
``She's a known figure, has instant recognizability and can draw on 
enormous resources from her husband's network.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some public sentiment for Mrs. Clinton now may not translate  
into political support in the New York Senate race, said Mitchell 
Moss, director of the Taub Urban Research Center at New York 
University. 
</P>
<P>
	``People are relating to her as first lady,'' he said. ``They  
are not relating to her as a candidate. Anyone who thinks you can 
run for office as first lady and maintain this kind of insularity 
is mistaken.''

<HEADLINE> Belle in Shouting Match With Manager </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- The Baltimore Orioles aren't saying what, if any,  
disciplinary measures will be taken against slugger Albert Belle 
following his shouting match with manager Ray Miller. 
</P>
<P>
	``When things like that happen on the bench or in the clubhouse,  
those are the type things we deal with internally,'' general 
manager Frank Wren said Thursday after the Orioles arrived in 
Atlanta for a series with the Braves starting tonight at Turner 
Field. 
</P>
<P>
	``What was said and what was done is an internal matter,'' Wren  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	He also said Miller ``isn't going to say any more about it,  
either.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Belle, who signed a five-year, $65 million free agent contract  
with Baltimore in December, has been suspended six times during his 
career. His disdain of the media is well known. 
</P>
<P>
	Belle, who has been struggling at the plate this year, had to be  
restrained by teammates after being removed from Wednesday night's 
4-2 victory over the Marlins. 
</P>
<P>
	Miller could not be reached for comment Thursday. A call to his  
Atlanta hotel room was answered by an unidentified person, who hung 
up when the reporter identified himself. 
</P>
<P>
	The incident occurred in the top of the ninth inning in the  
Orioles' dugout after Belle, who went 0-for-5 in the game, failed 
to run out a ground ball. 
</P>
<P>
	With two runners on and two outs in the ninth and the Orioles  
leading 4-2, Belle grounded to Marlins third baseman Mike Lowell. 
Belle slowed halfway to first, but Lowell's throw pulled first 
baseman Kevin Millar off the bag. 
</P>
<P>
	Miller replaced Belle in the outfield with Rich Amaral, a move  
he said he planned to make before Belle's groundout. 
</P>
<P>
	``Amaral knew he was going in if Albert made the last out when  
the inning started,'' Miller said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Belle was unaware of the move until he was on his way to his  
outfield position, eventually jogging back to the dugout. 
</P>
<P>
	In the dugout, TV cameras caught an exchange of expletives  
between Miller and Belle. Belle yelled angrily at Miller and was 
restrained by teammate Jeff Reboulet. Miller waved Belle off with a 
toss of his hand. 
</P>
<P>
	``My comment is that what happens internally will stay internal  
and will be taken care of internally,'' Miller said. ``What goes on 
between me and anybody stays in the clubhouse.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Belle, approached by reporters after the game, brushed them off  
with a stream of expletives. 
</P>
<P>
	Belle, struggling with a .244 batting average, has hit only one  
home run in his last 21 games. The Orioles, with a $78.5 million 
payroll, are the most disappointing team in baseball with a 22-36 
record, and there has been speculation that Miller's job is in 
jeopardy.

<HEADLINE> Missouri Dairy Recalls Cheese </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A Missouri dairy is recalling 228 pounds of  
mild cheddar cheese that may be contaminated with listeria, a 
potentially life-threatening bacterium. 
</P>
<P>
	Morningland Dairy Farms Inc. of Mountain View, Mo., ceased  
producing and distributing cheese last month after the Food and 
Drug Administration found the bacteria in another type of cheese 
that Morningland already recalled. 
</P>
<P>
	But Friday, the company also recalled Morningland Dairy Mild  
Cheddar Cheese that it had produced before last month's FDA action. 
The cheese is made from unpasteurized milk, and contamination 
showed up in tests by health officials. 
</P>
<P>
	The mild cheddar cheese was sold in plastic bags ranging from  
half a pound to 20 pounds, with the code C179 written in ink on the 
label. 
</P>
<P>
	Listeria can cause serious, potentially fatal, infections in  
young children, the elderly and people with weak immune systems. It 
also can cause miscarriages. Healthy people, however, usually 
suffer short-term symptoms, including diarrhea, nausea, abdominal 
pain and fever. 
</P>
<P>
	No illnesses have been reported.

<HEADLINE> NBC, AT&AMP;T To Bring HDTV to Cable </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- AT&AMP;T will soon be providing NBC programs in  
high-definition television through its cable TV lines. 
</P>
<P>
	An eight-year deal announced Thursday between AT&AMP;T Broadband &AMP;  
Internet Services and NBC is one of the first HDTV partnerships 
between a cable company and a broadcaster. 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement also commits AT&AMP;T Broadband &AMP; Internet to carrying  
NBC's cable services MSNBC and CNBC, and the network's Olympics 
programming, according to a statement released by the companies. 
</P>
<P>
	Cable operators previously had said they did not have enough  
capacity to carry HDTV programming because it eats up too much 
space on cable TV systems. 
</P>
<P>
	``This new agreement, which will bring great value and benefit  
to our customers well into the next decade, demonstrates that the 
cable industry and broadcasters can amicably reach agreement on 
important matters,'' Leo J. Hindrey Jr., president and CEO of AT&AMP;T 
Broadband and Internet, said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	The two companies said they will not only work to provide  
digital programming for new high-definition television sets, but 
also for traditional TVs through set-top boxes that will be 
compatible with high-definition signals. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal regulators now require stations in the 10 largest U.S.  
cities to send digital signals. This fall, another 20 cities will 
face that requirement. 
</P>
<P>
	The few television shows that are currently shot in digital  
format, including ``The Tonight Show With Jay Leno,'' are still 
converted to analog for most viewers. 
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T Broadband &AMP; Internet, formerly known as Tele-Communications  
Inc. prior to a merger with New York-based AT&AMP;T, has more than 10 
million customers nationwide.

<HEADLINE> Spurs' `Pop' Endured Tough Times </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN ANTONIO (AP) -- Only three months ago, Gregg Popovich heard  
boos. Some fans wanted the coach fired. 
</P>
<P>
	Now the San Antonio Spurs are in the NBA Finals, and his critics  
are nowhere to be found. If Popovich takes private pleasure in the 
turn of events, he won't say so. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not about vindication. It's about getting better. We  
started out poorly and we were a poor team. We continued to work. 
We got better and better,'' Popovich said. 
</P>
<P>
	San Antonio, after starting the season 6-8 in February, won 31  
of its last 36 games and captured the Midwest Division and Western 
Conference titles. The top-seeded Spurs are 11-1 in the postseason, 
having swept their last two playoff opponents to reach the finals. 
</P>
<P>
	The Spurs face the winner of the Eastern Conference finals  
between New York and Indiana. The championship series begins 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Popovich and his players say they don't think much about the  
team's miserable start. 
</P>
<P>
	``We probably thought about it more when we were 6-8, I would  
imagine. But that was a long time ago and a different team, really, 
as far as organization is concerned and our time together,'' 
Popovich said. 
</P>
<P>
	Perhaps the lowest point came Feb. 28, when the Spurs were blown  
out on their home court by longtime nemesis Utah. Popovich was 
tossed from the game with two technicals in the third quarter, so 
he wasn't around for the end of the game and the boos from the 
Alamodome crowd. 
</P>
<P>
	Speculation intensified that Popovich would be ousted as coach.  
</P>
<P>
	``We weren't playing well. They were talking about Pop getting  
fired,'' guard Mario Elie said. ``We weren't playing up to our 
capability.'' 
</P>
<P>
	David Robinson, who'd spent all 10 years of his professional  
career in San Antonio, even became the subject of trade rumors. 
Robinson said the Spurs players knew something had to change -- and 
fast. 
</P>
<P>
	``At that point, you'd better figure out how to string together  
five or six wins in a row,'' Robinson said. ``There were doubts. 
Everybody had doubts. We had to get through it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Two nights after the Utah debacle, life improved for the Spurs  
with a victory at Houston. It was the start of a nine-game winning 
streak that set the tone for the rest of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	``We decided to come together instead of separate,'' Elie said.  
``You learn from that. When you start off tough, you grow as 
individuals and you grow as a team and you realize, hey, you have 
to do whatever it takes to help the team win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Popovich said his only satisfaction comes in feeling happy for  
what his players accomplished. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm proud of them for staying the course and working through  
the hard times to enjoy the good times,'' he said. ``That's our job 
and the guys did it well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Instead of listening to jeers, Popovich now finds himself  
surrounded by the ``Go Spurs Go'' chants of a town jubilant over 
the team's first trip to the finals in its 26-year history in San 
Antonio. Popovich's detractors, if still out there, are silent. 
</P>
<P>
	Popovich is completing his second full season as coach. He  
became the team's general manager in 1994 and took over the 
coaching job after firing Bob Hill in December 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Because he's also the general manager, Popovich had the benefit  
of assembling the team he coaches. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides drafting top pick Tim Duncan in 1997 -- a ``no brainer,''  
as Popovich put it -- he added veterans Elie, Steve Kerr and Jerome 
Kersey this season to give the Spurs more playoff and championship 
experience. 
</P>
<P>
	Reaching the finals feels good, Popovich admits.  
</P>
<P>
	``But there are a lot of people who could take this group to the  
finals,'' he said. ``It's a hell of a group of guys.''

<HEADLINE> Fund Investors Needn't Play Fed Game </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Here's a way to stamp yourself as a true  
contrarian in the eyes of your fellow mutual-fund investors: Tell 
them you don't pay very much attention to the Federal Reserve. 
</P>
<P>
	What?!, they will likely reply. Surely you know that the Fed,  
with its decisions to tighten or ease credit conditions, exerts a 
powerful influence on stocks, bonds, the money markets -- just about 
every kind of security a mutual fund can own. 
</P>
<P>
	Wall Street analysts, economists, journalists and politicians  
sift through every statement uttered by Alan Greenspan, the Fed's 
chairman, like starving prospectors panning for gold. 
</P>
<P>
	The policies of Greenspan and his predecessor, Paul Volcker, are  
widely cited as primary reasons why the United States has tamed 
inflation, setting the stage for a generation-long bull market in 
financial assets. 
</P>
<P>
	That's all true, you may reply -- you have no argument with that  
description, point by point. But the way it is all too often played 
in the financial world, Fed-watching is a short-term game with high 
risks and very uncertain rewards. 
</P>
<P>
	Get caught up in the Fed's doings, and you can easily stray from  
your long-term financial plan, forgetting what you meant to 
accomplish in the first place. Like any other attempt to figure out 
the future, trying to outguess the Fed may subject you to paralysis 
by analysis, a dread cause of indecision and procrastination. 
</P>
<P>
	So your effort to become a better fund investor by keeping a  
close eye on the Federal Reserve's credit policy could wind up 
hurting you more than it helps. 
</P>
<P>
	Illustration: Suppose you set out today to put together a  
portfolio of fund investments, keeping ever-present in your mind 
recent hints from the Fed that it might tighten credit sometime 
soon by pushing short-term interest rates higher. 
</P>
<P>
	By long-standing tradition, you know that that isn't good news  
for stocks, because a restrictive policy puts the squeeze on 
economic growth and enhances the relative allure of 
interest-bearing securities that compete with stocks for investors' 
favor. 
</P>
<P>
	Likewise for high-yield bonds, which depend on an expanding  
economy. Ditto for government and other high-quality bonds, whose 
prices must decline when rates rise to keep their yields 
competitive with new bonds coming to market. 
</P>
<P>
	Bad news, also, for foreign stocks and bonds, even though  
central banks in other countries might not make policy moves 
parallel to those of the Fed. 
</P>
<P>
	Consider these current words from Barton Biggs, the widely  
respected global investment strategist at Morgan Stanley Dean 
Witter &AMP; Co.: ``I am reducing my exposure to equities not only in 
the U.S. but also in Europe and the emerging markets, because it is 
unrealistic to think they can buck the tide if the Dow and the S&AMP;P 
(U.S. market indexes) fade.'' 
</P>
<P>
	What's left to invest in? Very little except short-term  
money-market funds, whose yields, now ranging between 4.5 percent 
and 5 percent, stand to rise with a lag as short-term interest 
rates climb. 
</P>
<P>
	Nice, safe choice. Trouble is, money fund yields may not go up  
after all if the Fed decides not to tighten the screws. Even if it 
does nudge rates slightly higher, you still need to remember that 
money fund returns have historically lagged far behind both stocks 
and bonds over the long term. 
</P>
<P>
	And it's the long term you care about, isn't it? Not what the  
Fed might do, or not do, next. Besides, there is a way to hedge 
against near-term monetary and economic uncertainties that doesn't 
require that you try to outsmart the markets. 
</P>
<P>
	If you diversify your assets among stock, bond and money-market  
funds, you can smooth out the short-term bumps caused by 
adjustments in Fed policy. You don't eliminate risk, but you can 
cushion it. 
</P>
<P>
	Once you are set up that way, you may make little or no change  
in your portfolio thereafter even if analysts proclaim a major 
shift in the Fed's policy. The time to lighten up on stocks, or to 
shift some money from bonds to money funds, or to make any other 
strategic move, will come when changes in your own life dictate, 
rather than when some analysts say they think maybe the Fed seems 
to be saying so.

<HEADLINE> Lamar Alexander Defends Staff Cuts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- GOP presidential hopeful Lamar  
Alexander says recent layoffs within his campaign were simply 
common sense shifts of resources. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we were a public company, our stock would have gone up,''  
he says. 
</P>
<P>
	In recent days Alexander has laid off his communications  
director, legal counsel and several support staffers. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we did was look down the road and save money so we'll  
have plenty for TV at the beginning of the year,'' he said in a 
telephone interview. ``And we put the money we have in the place 
where it will do the most good, and I think that's just smart.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The former Tennessee governor and U.S. education secretary has  
said he is moving campaign staff and infrastructure to Iowa, site 
of the first presidential caucus in the nation next year and of a 
straw poll this summer. 
</P>
<P>
	Aides said he drew campaign contributions in the ``low six  
figures'' during a brief California visit. 
</P>
<P>
	He lamented the Republican rush to embrace Texas Gov. George W.  
Bush as the presumptive nominee eight months before the Iowa 
caucus. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's got millions of dollars, huge name recognition, so he  
should be expected to win big,'' Alexander said, seeking to raise 
the expectations for the front-runner. ``If he doesn't, it will 
indicate that people have decided that they'd like to have a role 
in choosing the Republican nominee, and they don't want the 
political elite to tell them who to vote for.'' 
</P>
<P>
	California's GOP is considering eliminating its winner-take-all  
presidential primary, and some political observers have said the 
proposed change would help underdog candidates like Alexander. 
</P>
<P>
	Under a proposal to be considered by the party's executive  
committee June 19, the GOP primary would shift to a ``proportional 
system'' in which the delegates would be splintered by 
congressional district. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead of one candidate taking all the delegates, several could  
walk away with a chunk of them. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm generally of the belief there will be one of us coming  
into California with such a head of steam that he or she is likely 
to win the whole thing,'' Alexander said. 
</P>
<P>
	But, he said, ``It may help candidates who have less money,  
because those candidates can concentrate on individual districts.''

<HEADLINE> Abortion Foe Sues Internet Provider </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- An anti-abortion activist has sued an Internet  
service provider for $251 million because it shut down his Web site 
depicting mangled fetuses and Wild West-style wanted posters of 
abortion doctors. 
</P>
<P>
	MindSpring Enterprises shut down Neal Horsley's site, ``The  
Nuremburg Files,'' in February, days after a federal jury in Oregon 
ordered several anti-abortion groups that contribute to the site to 
pay $107 million in damages because the tactics amounted to illegal 
threats. 
</P>
<P>
	Horsley, 55, was not a defendant, but MindSpring said his site  
violated the company's ``appropriate use policies.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a lawsuit filed in Gwinnett County court Tuesday, Horsley  
claims he was the victim of censorship. He says MindSpring 
destroyed hundreds of e-mails when it booted his site. 
</P>
<P>
	``If telephone companies shut people's telephones down because  
of what they believe or because of what they were saying and they 
weren't breaking the law, then I'm sure the American people would 
understand why that has to be stopped,'' Horsley said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The suit, filed Tuesday in Gwinnett County Superior Court, seeks  
$1 million for breach of contract and $250 million in punitive 
damages. Horsley's attorney, John Matteson, said the punitive 
damage figure is a percentage of what the company is worth. 
</P>
<P>
	``It takes that kind of money to get their attention and make  
some kind of impact on the wild things they're doing. They sit 
there like God erasing e-mail and deciding who can communicate with 
who,'' Matteson said. 
</P>
<P>
	MindSpring spokesman Ed Hansen said ``Mr. Horsley's service was  
terminated for one or more violations.'' He added: ``If this does 
go to court, it will become obvious how flagrant his violations 
were.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Web site, which Horsley now operates from his own server,  
lists the names and addresses of abortion doctors. The names of 
those who have been killed are crossed out and those injured listed 
in gray. 
</P>
<P>
	Three times, doctors on the list were killed, most recently last  
October when Dr. Barnett Slepian was gunned down in his home 
outside Buffalo, N.Y. His name on the site was crossed out that 
same day. 
</P>
<P>
	The site also invites readers to send in abortion doctors'  
addresses, license plate numbers and the names of their children.

	NATO Forces Enter Kosovo  
</P>
<P>
	PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- NATO peacekeepers began moving into  
Kosovo Saturday, just hours after a Russian armored column entered 
the capital in what Moscow officials called a mistake. NATO Chinook 
helicopters carrying British paratroopers flew across the border. 
The helicopters were to land troops on high ground along the 
Kacanik gorge overlooking the main road north to the Kosovo 
capital, Pristina, where Russian troops arrived hours earlier 
unexpectedly. Shortly after the allied helicopters flew into 
Kosovo, NATO vehicles began rolling into the province at Blace, 
Macedonia.

<HEADLINE> Mass. House Blasted Off Foundation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PLYMOUTH, Mass. (AP) -- A suspected gas explosion blew a house  
off its foundation early today, throwing its occupants into their 
back yard with only minor injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	Neighbors who reported the blast, which also damaged nearby  
homes, found a man and woman bloodied and wandering in a daze. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were in a second-floor bedroom and the house lifted, blew  
apart, and in the course they were thrown out,'' said Deputy Fire 
Chief James Pierson. ``I'm not sure even they know what happened.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Police identified the occupants as Cindy Vacchino, 48, and  
Jeffrey Marconi, 49, of Pembroke. They were treated for cuts and 
bruises at Jordan Hospital and released. 
</P>
<P>
	Fire officials said a leaky supply line from a propane tank was  
the likely cause of the 1:30 a.m. explosion which made the front of 
the house collapse. Foul play was not suspected, Pierson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Dishes lay intact among the debris, 60 feet away from the  
explosion, while household goods, including a table and lamp, 
littered the lawn. 
</P>
<P>
	Neighbor Jim Forand likened the blast to an exploding aerosol  
can ``times 100.'' When Forand got outside, he saw what remained of 
the Cape-style house and told his wife to call the fire department. 
</P>
<P>
	``I saw no walls, no roof, nothing. All I see is a fireball in  
the middle,'' Forand recalled later in a phone interview. 
</P>
<P>
	``I told my wife to tell them not to bother looking for  
survivors because there aren't any.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But then he was amazed to find the dazed survivors.  
</P>
<P>
	``I can't figure it out,'' Forand said. ``I saw it with my own  
eyes, and I can't understand it.''

<HEADLINE> Spain's CASA, Germany's DASA Merging </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MADRID, Spain (AP) -- DaimlerChrysler Aerospace AG and Spain's  
state-owned Construcciones Aeronauticas SA have signed an agreement 
of understanding to merge into Europe's first multinational 
aerospace company. 
</P>
<P>
	The new company, expected to be created by midsummer, will have  
annual revenue of more than $11 billion and a work force of 53,000 
people, the two firms said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	CASA had been courted by a number of European space groups. Just  
this week the newly merged French aerospace and defense group 
Aerospatiale Matra said it was interested in bidding for CASA. 
</P>
<P>
	Pedro Ferreras, president of SEPI, the Spanish state holding  
company that owns CASA, said Friday's agreement ``wasn't made 
against anyone.'' Rather, SEPI studied all the offers and bids and 
chose the most profitable one, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The merger will be carried out through a stock swap, with DASA  
controlling an 85 percent stake in the new company and CASA 15 
percent. They have yet to decide on a name for it. 
</P>
<P>
	``The aim of the merger is clear,'' Manfred Bischoff, president  
and chief executive officer of DASA, said at a news conference. 
``We will strengthen our competitiveness by combining our 
complementary activities. And together we will continue to 
contribute to the restructuring of our industry in Europe.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A spokesman for British Aerospace, which has long advocated  
consolidation in Europe's aerospace and defense industries and had 
expressed interest in CASA, said: ``I suppose we are disappointed 
in some way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But he said the merger does not put BAe at a disadvantage. ``We  
view this as another step in the consolidation process.''

<HEADLINE> Senate Leaders List Modest Assets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Senate's leaders are far wealthier than  
most Americans but men of modest means compared with some of their 
rank-and-file colleagues, financial records revealed today. 
</P>
<P>
	Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., and Minority Leader Tom  
Daschle, D-S.D., both own rental property, mutual funds and stocks, 
but are hardly in the multimillionaires' club. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither are assistant Democratic leader Harry Reid of Nevada nor  
Lott deputy Sen. Don Nickles of Oklahoma, although Reid has a 
substantial real estate portfolio and Nickles was busy in 1998 
buying and selling investments. 
</P>
<P>
	In an annual ritual that reveals where lawmakers invest their  
assets and earn any non-congressional income, financial disclosure 
forms are publicly released and then scrutinized by reporters. The 
Senate forms are out today, the House disclosures next Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Since congressional rules do not require net worth statements,  
the value of holdings and non-congressional income is only 
expressed in broad ranges. 
</P>
<P>
	Compared with most Americans, a lawmaker's income is large. The  
rank-and-file salary is $136,700, with floor leaders earning 
$151,800 and the speaker of the House $175,400. 
</P>
<P>
	For some their government salary is only a fraction of their  
income. Among the wealthiest senators are John D. Rockefeller IV, 
D-W.Va., Herb Kohl, D-Wis., Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., and Frank 
Lautenberg, D-N.J. 
</P>
<P>
	Many lawmakers have working spouses, most invest in stocks and  
mutual funds, and a substantial number have real estate holdings -- 
some of them earning rental income. 
</P>
<P>
	Daschle listed a portfolio of two-dozen mutual funds, but only  
one reached the $50,001 to $100,000 range in 1998. The others were 
in the $15,001-$50,000 category or the lower, $1,001-$15,000 range. 
</P>
<P>
	The Democratic leader, whose wife is a lobbyist, also owns two  
rental apartments in Washington's Virginia suburbs and one in Sioux 
Falls, S.D. -- each worth between $50,001 and $100,000 and producing 
$5,001-$15,000 in income. 
</P>
<P>
	Lott's major assets include a one-half partnership in six rental  
apartments in Mississippi worth with a combined value of 
$50,001-$100,000, three investment funds worth between $1,001 and 
$15,000 and 161 unimproved acres in his home state worth between 
$50,001 and $100,000. Most of the family assets are in Lott's 
wife's name and all were valued at $50,000 and under. 
</P>
<P>
	Nickles had a busy trading year, with 15 investment purchases  
and 15 sales. The purchases included Citigroup, Coca-Cola, Compaq 
Computer Corp., Johnson &AMP; Johnson, McDonalds and Parker Drilling 
Co. 
</P>
<P>
	Reid listed a $500,001-$1 million partnership interest in a  
company that owns a Las Vegas office building, while other real 
estate holdings could be worth more than $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
	In contrast to the leaders' holdings, Lautenberg is still  
reaping huge financial rewards from Automatic Data Processing, the 
payroll services company he co-founded. His shares in ADP are worth 
between $5 million and $25 million. 
</P>
<P>
	He has a blind trust valued between $5 million and $25 million  
and a second valued between $1 million and $5 million. Together, 
they produced income of more than $5 million in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Like Lautenberg, Sen. Slade Gorton, R-Wash., has a blind trust,  
valued between $250,001 and $500,000. His holdings in Slade Gorton 
&AMP; Co., a wholesale fish packer, are valued between $1 million and 
$5 million. 
</P>
<P>
	But even Lautenberg's fortune pales next to Rockefeller's three  
blind trusts -- one worth more than $50 million, another valued 
between $25 million and $50 million and a third between $5 million 
and $25 million. The most valuable trust earned between $1,000,001 
and $5 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The West Virginia Democrat listed one liability, between a  
half-million and $1 million, with a Charleston bank. 
</P>
<P>
	Kohl, owner of the Milwaukee Bucks basketball team, reported a  
blind trust worth more than $50 million -- mostly in real estate 
investments in Milwaukee. The trust earned more than $5 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Kohl listed nearly $27.5 million in gross receipts from the NBA  
franchise, which is valued at more than $50 million. He has a horse 
breeding ranch in Kelly, Wyo., reporting $68,100 in income from 
horse sales. 
</P>
<P>
	While some senators have major real estate investments, Sen.  
Blanche Lincoln, D-Ark., and her husband have their 40 acres in 
Cleburne County, Ark., valued between $15,001 and $50,000. She also 
has shares in the Sandy Slough Hunting Club in her state, with the 
same valuation; and a piece of her family's Arkansas farm, Green 
Acres, valued between $100,001 and $250,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Among freshmen, Sen. Peter Fitzgerald, R-Ill. listed holdings  
between $25.6 million and $51.5 million. The vast majority is in 
Bank of Montreal stock he inherited after his father sold his 
suburban Chicago banking empire. 
</P>
<P>
	Another first-year senator, former Rep. and Hall of Fame pitcher  
Jim Bunning, R-Ky., earned $34,884 from sports shows and other 
memorabilia activities. Bunning received a waiver to accept his 
trip from Major League Baseball to Cooperstown last July for the 
annual Hall of Fame induction ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., owns one-third of a cottage in  
Ireland valued at $50,001 to $100,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Ernest Hollings, D-S.C., age 77, has one of the longest  
held plots of land among senators: a half-interest in a Charleston 
lot that he bought for $883 in April 1935. No current value is 
listed. 
</P>
<P>
	But that wasn't the only small sum disclosed. Retiring Sen.  
Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y., barely made enough for a few 
expensive Washington dinners with his royalties on four scholarly 
books. ``Pandemonium'' -- about the relations of ethnic groups -- 
brought in $195. The other three earned $151, $123 and $75. 
</P>
<P>
	With stringent Senate rules in place against accepting items of  
value, few senators listed any gifts. An exception was Sen. Robert 
Torricelli, D-N.J., who received a ticket to the U.S. Open tennis 
tournament from Democratic fund-raiser Clive Cummis. 
</P>
<P>
	While the gift exceeded the Senate's $50 limit, Torricelli  
qualified for an exemption based on a longtime friendship. 
</P>
<P>
	Torricelli, head of the Democrats' senatorial campaign  
committee, said he and Cummis have been personal friends for more 
than 25 years.

<HEADLINE> Chicagoans React to Court Decision </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- After his home was sprayed with bullets during a  
gang turf war five years ago, Emmett Moore pleaded with Chicago 
police to round up the youths who loitered on his block. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the city's tough anti-gang law, officers could break up  
groups of people hanging out in public ``with no apparent 
purpose.'' But not any more. The Supreme Court struck down the law 
Thursday, calling it unconstitutionally vague. 
</P>
<P>
	``The constitution is supposed to protect my rights too,'' said  
Moore, 74. ``What's a more basic right than feeling safe on my 
property or being able to walk on my street?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Moore and other supporters of the ordinance said the Supreme  
Court arrogantly elevated abstract ideals of civil liberty over the 
practical problems of gang violence in a decision that patronizes 
those simply looking for safer streets. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll be doggone if the Supreme Court can tell me what's best  
for my neighborhood,'' Alderman Ed Smith said. ``I can guarantee 
that each one of the justices lives in ostentatiousness. They have 
no idea what we live like.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Justice Clarence Thomas, the court's only black member, echoed  
Smith's sentiments in a furious dissent to the 6-3 ruling. He said 
the court had ``unnecessarily sentenced law-abiding citizens to 
lives of terror and misery.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The people who suffer from our lofty pronouncements are people  
... who have seen their neighborhoods literally destroyed by gangs 
and violence and drugs,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1992 ordinance required police to order any group of people  
standing around to move along if an officer believed at least one 
of them belonged to a street gang. It led to 45,000 arrests in the 
three years it was enforced. 
</P>
<P>
	Solden Collins, 65, has lived in the impoverished Austin  
community on Chicago's West Side for more than 30 years. For most 
of this year, drug dealers have used the vacant lot across the 
street from his home as their base of operations. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd look out the window and there they were, just hanging out,  
causing trouble,'' he said, adding the impact was immense: The 
streets became desolate as people feared going outside and some 
neighbors decided to move. 
</P>
<P>
	There is disagreement over how many street gang members reside  
in Chicago. City police estimated gang membership might total 
10,000, but the court was told federal prosecutors believe the 
total might be closer to 100,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Some Austin residents say there is barely a corner or alley in  
the neighborhood that is not manned by an intimidating group. Most 
don't understand the logic of the Supreme Court's decision. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith, who has been Austin's representative for 16 years, said  
he witnessed police officers disperse and arrest gang members under 
the law, and he never saw them abuse their power. ``It never 
happened,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	By invalidating the law, Smith said, the Supreme Court took away  
a valuable tool to battle the area's pervasive problems. 
</P>
<P>
	But the high court said the law simply gave officers too much  
discretion to arrest people who never had adequate warning of what 
conduct was forbidden. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the loitering is in fact harmless and innocent, the  
dispersal order itself is an unjustified impairment of liberty,'' 
even if it did reduce crime, Justice John Paul Stevens, a Chicago 
native, said in the court's main opinion. 
</P>
<P>
	Harvey Grossman, the American Civil Liberties Union lawyer who  
successfully challenged the ordinance, said the court correctly 
understood that anti-loitering laws are vulnerable to abuse and can 
lead to discrimination against minorities. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are grateful ... that it is not a criminal activity simply  
to be a young man of color gathered with friends on the streets of 
Chicago,'' said Grossman. ``Such laws are likely to be enforced in 
a discriminatory manner.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mayor Richard Daley said the city will try to draft a new  
ordinance that will withstand constitutional scrutiny. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will go back and correct it and then move forward,'' he  
said. ``These are known gangbangers and dope dealers. What do I do, 
throw a picnic for them?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Until the law is revamped, people like Moore say, gang members  
will only be emboldened by the court's ruling. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Supreme Court is on their side,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Online Auctioneer eBay Fixes Site </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- A computer crash forced the online  
auction house eBay to suspend all bidding, frustrating millions of 
customers of one of the hottest businesses on both the Internet and 
Wall Street. 
</P>
<P>
	The halt came after eBay tried to launch a revamped version of  
its Web site. The computer server went down Thursday night and was 
up again Friday night. The shutdown disrupted bidding on millions 
of collectibles and curios. 
</P>
<P>
	``We do realize how frustrating this is and we are doing our  
best to ensure that the system is restored as quickly and 
efficiently as humanly possible,'' eBay spokesman Kevin Pursglove 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	MarGee Charlier of Kewaunee, Wis., who sells 50 to 100 antiques  
each day through eBay, said she knew her business was in trouble 
when she logged in first thing Friday morning and saw that it had 
crashed. 
</P>
<P>
	``Devastation,'' she said.  
</P>
<P>
	EBay is the world's largest online auction site, with more than  
2 million items listed at any time. In an average minute on eBay, 
more than 150 new items are listed, 500 bids are placed and seven 
new people register. Its Web site receives more than 600 million 
hits a month. 
</P>
<P>
	Visitors to the Web site Friday got a continuing stream of  
updates and apologies from management. 
</P>
<P>
	Bidding was stopped Thursday around 11 p.m. EDT. While eBay  
initially said the site would be back up Friday afternoon, it did 
not become operational until about 8:30 p.m. EDT. Pursglove said it 
would take several hours to return to full service. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is frustrating,'' said Sharon Doney in Severn, Md., who  
is trying to raise $250,000 through online auctions of records and 
books to cover medical bills for her failing liver. ``Say you were 
at a real auction and the auctioneer just walked away for a while. 
It just doesn't work.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Doney said that problems on eBay -- short crashes, slowdowns and  
postponed auction endings -- during the past few months have already 
led her to got to other auction sites, including Amazon.com and 
Yahoo! 
</P>
<P>
	One of eBay's worst previous outages, which lasted about six  
hours, prevented the company from holding auctions of just-released 
merchandise tied to the latest ``Star Wars'' movie. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest outage was unrelated to the computer virus that began  
infecting systems across the country this week. 
</P>
<P>
	EBay has struggled to keep up with a huge surge in demand.  
Registered users went from 1.2 million last fall to 3.8 million as 
of March 31. 
</P>
<P>
	Those users bought and sold more than $541 million in  
merchandise through 22.9 million transactions during the first 
quarter of this year. EBay makes its money by taking a percentage 
on each sale. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first quarter of its fiscal year, eBay reported a  
quarterly profit of $5.9 million, making it one of the few 
consistently profitable Internet companies. 
</P>
<P>
	EBay stock has been traded publicly since September. Its stock  
had rocketed from $8.43 3/4 a share to $234 by April, but has since 
fallen by more than 20 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	News of the site outage sent shares tumbling more than 9 percent  
Friday. Ebay closed down $16.81 1/4 at $165.87 1/2 on the Nasdaq Stock 
Market. 
</P>
<P>
	Andrew Bartels, senior research analyst at Cambridge,  
Mass.-based Giga Information Group, said outages should be 
expected. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's actually not that big of a deal,'' he said. ``This is  
still new technology and these high transaction sites will 
periodically go down.''

<HEADLINE> Oil Prices Fall on Weak Demand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Weaker global demand for oil offset production  
cuts by oil exporters, causing the price of crude to drop last 
month by more than $2 per barrel, the International Energy Agency 
reported Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Oil inventories fell more slowly than expected, even though  
compliance with agreed production cuts by oil-producing countries 
improved to 90 percent from April's level of 82 percent, the agency 
said in a report faxed from its Paris headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
	Global crude production fell last month by 400,000 barrels per  
day to a new total of 73 million barrels per day. 
</P>
<P>
	However, a decline in seasonal demand for heating oil and other  
products together with uninterrupted exports from Iraq helped 
depress prices. OPEC's benchmark price for a barrel of crude 
dropped to $12.66 a barrel in May from $15 in April, the IEA said. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month's price decrease followed a $7 per barrel run-up  
during the previous 2 1/2 months. That earlier price jump resulted 
from an agreement by OPEC members and other producers to slash 
production by 2.1 million barrels per day in an effort to boost 
prices. 
</P>
<P>
	The IEA forecast that global demand for oil would rise this year  
to an average of 75 million barrels per day, an increase of 1.4 
percent above 1998. Much of the reason would be continued economic 
recovery in Asia, particularly in Japan and South Korea, it said. 
</P>
<P>
	Among OPEC's 11 members, only Nigeria, Kuwait and Algeria  
increased production in May, the IEA reported. 
</P>
<P>
	The IEA is part of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and  
Development, a group of the world' most developed nations.

<HEADLINE> Pentagon OKs Landing Gear Merger </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The military won't buy some sensitive  
equipment from foreign companies, but doesn't mind going overseas 
for aircraft landing gear, a Pentagon official told a Senate panel 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was our conclusion that this was not a security problem,''  
Dave Oliver, the Defense Department's principal deputy 
undersecretary for acquisitions and technology, told the Senate 
Judiciary antitrust subcommittee. 
</P>
<P>
	Responding to concerns that the proposed merger of BFGoodrich  
Co. and Coltec Industries would leave just two choices for the 
essential aircraft component, one American and one French, Oliver 
said the consolidation of the U.S. firms would not change the 
market share of Messier-Dowty, the French company. 
</P>
<P>
	``They have 50 percent of the market for military planes and  
they would have 50 percent after this,'' he said, declining to 
answer some of the subcommittee's questions in order to avoid 
saying anything that might influence a court case challenging the 
proposed merger. 
</P>
<P>
	Oliver said the Pentagon would keep an eye on the merged company  
and take steps to combat any anti-competitive practices, but Alan 
Reuther of the United Auto Workers called that too little, too 
late. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Mike DeWine, R-Ohio, chairman of the subcommittee, said he  
was frustrated with the answers he got from Oliver and with 
BFGoodrich, which refused to state outright whether it intends to 
shut down its Cleveland landing gear operation. 
</P>
<P>
	BFGoodrich's general counsel, Terrence G. Linnert, said no plan  
for the Cleveland facility could be made until after the company 
sees all available data on Coltec's operations. 
</P>
<P>
	Richfield, Ohio-based BFGoodrich and Charlotte, N.C.-based  
Coltec want to merge their operations and form the world's largest 
manufacturer of aircraft landing gear. 
</P>
<P>
	BFGoodrich makes landing gear in Cleveland and in Tullahoma,  
Tenn. Coltec's Menasco Aerospace arm makes landing gear in Euless, 
Texas; Everett, Wash.; and Oakville, Ontario, Canada. 
</P>
<P>
	The merger has the approval of the Defense Department and the  
Federal Trade Commission but has been on hold because of a court 
order in Indiana, where a federal court is considering complaints 
from a potentially affected company, Allied Signal Aircraft Landing 
Systems. 
</P>
<P>
	BFGoodrich has about 20 percent of the worldwide landing gear  
market, according to the industry reference, Jane's Aircraft 
Component Manufacturers. Coltec's Menasco has about 25 percent. The 
leader, Messier-Dowty of France, has about 35 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. military already buys about half of its landing gear  
from Messier-Dowty.

<HEADLINE> NATO Troops Await Kosovo Orders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BLACE, Macedonia (AP) -- British paratroopers camped along  
Macedonia's border today awaiting orders to enter Kosovo as Serb 
troops continued their pullout. A Russian convoy stationed in 
Bosnia headed toward Kosovo, intensifying the debate about Moscow's 
role in the peacekeeping force. 
</P>
<P>
	Vice President Gore said Russia has given the allies assurances  
that none of its soldiers will enter Kosovo, a day after NATO 
suspended its 78-day Yugoslav air war and readied a 50-000-strong 
international peacekeeping force to take up positions inside the 
southern Serb province. 
</P>
<P>
	Russian peacekeeping forces based in Bosnia since that war ended  
in 1995 were seen headed toward the province. An AP photographer 
saw a convoy in Ruma, a Serbian town about 35 miles west of 
Belgrade, with vehicles flying Russian flags. 
</P>
<P>
	The independent Beta news agency reported that a convoy of  
Russian troops -- up to 1,000 forces -- in armored vehicles and 
trucks crossed over from Bosnia into Serbia. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russian vehicles were seen with what appeared to be hastily  
drawn KFOR markings, the insignia of the Kosovo peacekeeping force 
waiting along Macedonian borders to enter the southern Serb 
province. 
</P>
<P>
	The convoy passed through Belgrade today and was last seen on  
the southbound highway headed toward Nis, near Kosovo's border. 
</P>
<P>
	The convoy, headed by a Yugoslav government car, contained more  
than 50 vehicles flying the Russian colors and displaying KFOR 
markings. 
</P>
<P>
	Secretary of State Madeleine Albright expressed surprise when  
she arrived in Macedonia and heard about the Russian troop 
movement. 
</P>
<P>
	But she received assurances from Russian Foreign Minister Igor  
Ivanov that the troop movement was just a preliminary step and the 
Russians would not deploy into Kosovo until arrangements were 
worked out, her spokesman James P. Rubin said. 
</P>
<P>
	Albright, told of the movement by British Lt. Gen. Michael  
Jackson, commander of NATO troops in Macedonia, ordered Deputy 
Secretary of State Strobe Talbott to return to Moscow immediately. 
</P>
<P>
	Talbott, who had been in Moscow discussing ticklish arrangements  
for the participation of the Russians in the peacekeeping force, 
had been en route to Brussels. 
</P>
<P>
	Hours after the Russians crossed over from Bosnia, NATO  
spokesman Maj. David Scanlon said up to 200 Russian soldiers headed 
toward Kosovo would return to Bosnia after preparing for the 
arrival of a more permanent Russian peacekeeping contingent. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the Russian move ``was not unexpected.''  
</P>
<P>
	``The Russian commander was ordered through his chain of command  
to deploy an advance party ... to prepare for the arrival of the 
Russian contribution to the international peacekeeping force in 
Kosovo,'' he said in Sarajevo. 
</P>
<P>
	Some Western officials suggested the Russians had caught them  
off guard. 
</P>
<P>
	But Gore told Cable News Network: ``We've been given absolute  
assurances they will not move into Kosovo.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The development came amid continuing debate about Russian  
participation in any Kosovo peace force. The Russians -- 
particularly senior officers -- insist they will not put their 
troops under NATO command, something NATO has insisted on. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the entry of the first NATO troops into Kosovo from  
neighboring Macedonia, originally expected today, was pushed back, 
possibly as much as 24 hours, NATO sources said. They did not 
specify the cause of the delay. 
</P>
<P>
	British paratroopers, the spearhead of the international force  
that will eventually number 50,000, camped along the border, 
preparing to move into Kosovo, to be followed by French and other 
NATO forces. Up to 7,000 U.S. troops are to take part in the 
peacekeeping force. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO and Yugoslav liaison officers were trying to coordinate  
movements in a complicated plan that calls for peacekeepers to move 
into designated areas as soon as Serb-led forces pull out. 
</P>
<P>
	Yugoslav troops began their pullback from Kosovo on Thursday,  
prompting NATO to suspend its air campaign, which started March 24. 
The U.N. Security Council then authorized a heavily armed security 
force to enter Kosovo to restore peace and begin reconstruction. 
</P>
<P>
	The Yugoslav withdrawal continued today. In Prokuplje, cheering  
residents threw flowers onto several dozen Yugoslav army vehicles 
heading northward. 
</P>
<P>
	In Brussels, NATO said 4,000 Serb military personnel had left  
Kosovo by today. 
</P>
<P>
	Citing unidentified sources, The New York Times reported today  
that U.S. and NATO officials envision Kosovo will become an 
international protectorate and could gain independence after a few 
years. Yugoslavia has deeply opposed both scenarios. 
</P>
<P>
	Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic proclaimed victory  
Thursday, despite the death and destruction wreaked by the air 
campaign and the imminent arrival of a huge foreign force on 
Yugoslav soil. 
</P>
<P>
	In Washington, President Clinton declared victory too and warned  
Milosevic that airstrikes would resume if he reneges on a peace 
deal to allow more than 860,000 ethnic Albanian refugees to return 
to Kosovo. Most fled to Macedonia and Albania. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier today, Albright met with Lt. Gen. Jackson, commander of  
NATO troops in Macedonia, and was then taken to Camp Able Sentry, a 
base for U.S. troops preparing to go into Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will have to do some winterizing of the tents in the  
camps,'' Albright said. ``We can't count on everyone getting back 
before the weather.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, Albright said, investigators, possibly  
including the FBI, want to get to Kosovo as quickly as possible 
before evidence of atrocities is destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
	Kosovo is in southern Serbia, the dominant republic in  
Yugoslavia. Although Serbs regard it as the heartland of their 
nation, its prewar population of 2.1 million was 90 percent ethnic 
Albanian. 
</P>
<P>
	The crisis began in February 1998 when Milosevic cracked down on  
the rebellious Kosovo Liberation Army. NATO began bombing 
Yugoslavia after Milosevic refused to sign a peace agreement 
crafted in Rambouillet, France.

<HEADLINE> Rookie Zonta Returns After Injury </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MONTREAL (AP) -- Riccardo Zonta is trying very hard not to show  
his impatience. 
</P>
<P>
	When the 23-year-old Brazilian drove onto Circuit Gilles  
Villeneuve today at the start of practice for the Canadian Grand 
Prix, it was a resumption of a budding Formula One career that was 
suspended when he crashed hard in Brazil during practice for the 
second race of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, Zonta's F1 resume shows only a non-finish in the  
season-opener in Australia because of a gearbox failure. 
</P>
<P>
	But at least the cast is off his mending right ankle after a  
month of hampered mobility. 
</P>
<P>
	``The biggest problem now is when I stop walking and stand on  
the foot,'' Zonta said Thursday as his team prepared his 
BAR-Supertec race car nearby. ``When I am in the car, with the foot 
out in front of me, no problem.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Zonta, a test driver for Team McLaren last year and the FIA  
Grand Touring Champion, said he wasn't deterred by the first injury 
of his racing career -- but he was frustrated. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wanted to get back into the car sooner than this,'' he said.  
``I wanted to come back (last month) in Monaco, but the doctor said 
I had to be able to jump on one foot and I wasn't ready for that, 
yet. 
</P>
<P>
	``They said I wasn't ready yet for Barcelona (two weeks ago),  
but I thought I was.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Until today, his only time in the cockpit of his BAR ride since  
the accident was last week in Silverstone, England. But even that 
was very dissatisfying. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was set and I only got five laps,'' Zonta said with a  
smile. ``That was not enough to tell me much.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fortunately for the youngster, his gear shift lever is on the  
steering wheel. Unfortunately, he has had to adjust from 
right-footed breaking to the left foot. 
</P>
<P>
	``That is a big change, but I'm a professional race driver and I  
will get used to it,'' he said. ``Sometimes, you just have to 
adjust.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Veteran racer Mika Salo of Finland took Zonta's place for three  
races and managed finishes of seventh in San Marino and eighth in 
Spain -- the team best this season. Championship points are awarded 
only to the top six in each race. 
</P>
<P>
	BAR, in only its second season, also fields cars for local  
favorite Jacques Villeneuve. The former Indianapolis 500 winner and 
CART champion has had a season that may even be more frustrating 
than Zonta's. 
</P>
<P>
	Villeneuve, who was considered one of the top drivers in Formula  
One while racing for Team Williams in 1996 and 1997, has failed to 
finish in five starts this season. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mika is an experienced driver and I know he helped the team to  
grow up a lot,'' Zonta said. ``For me, it's difficult because this 
is my first race back. For Jacques, it's difficult because he needs 
to finish races and the team needs to score points. 
</P>
<P>
	``But we are working hard and getting stronger. We just have to  
finish races.''

<HEADLINE> U.S. Panel OKs Tariff on Japan Steel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Domestic steel producers are calling a U.S.  
panel's approval of punitive tariffs against low-priced Japanese 
shipments a vindication for their claims of injury. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. International Trade Commission approved tariffs ranging  
from 18 percent to 67 percent on Japanese hot-rolled carbon steel, 
the industry's main product. 
</P>
<P>
	Those tariffs, to be imposed within weeks and made retroactive  
to February, will make Japanese steel more expensive to sell in the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Although domestic producers do not consider tariffs to be a  
cure-all, they portrayed the commission's 6-0 vote Friday as a 
recognition of their plight. The U.S. industry blames low-priced 
imports for thousands of layoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	``The ruling should silence our critics who have portrayed the  
domestic steel industry as antiquated, whining protectionists,'' 
said Richard K. Riederer, president and chief executive of Weirton 
Steel Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	The trade commission determined that Japanese pricing practices,  
already deemed illegal by the Commerce Department, have or could 
hurt domestic producers. Tariffs approved Friday are likely to be 
in place for at least five years. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. industry will now turn its attention to the Senate,  
which is expected later this month to consider two bills designed 
to help domestic producers. One would create a $1 billion loan 
fund, and the other would impose global steel quotas. 
</P>
<P>
	The House overwhelmingly passed a quota bill in March by a  
289-141 vote, despite the threat of a presidential veto. Unlike 
tariffs, quotas apply to all countries and all products at once. 
</P>
<P>
	``This (tariff) determination is another good step toward ending  
the flood of illegal imports,'' said Rep. Pete Visclosky, D-Ind., 
chief sponsor of the House quota bill. ``However, this 
determination does not go far enough.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Japanese steel producers blamed politics for the ruling.  
</P>
<P>
	``We are disappointed that a majority of the commissioners,  
facing overwhelming political pressure, ignored the facts and 
imposed long-term restrictions on hot-rolled steel imports,'' said 
Hidenori Tazawa, executive vice president for NKK America Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the tariffs ``will raise prices and limit supply  
availability and choice for U.S. steel users.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Another executive, Masaki Sato of Nippon Steel U.S.A. Inc., said  
earlier that his company is likely to appeal to the U.S. Court of 
International Trade in New York. The court handles disputed cases 
from the trade commission, a fact-finding agency independent from 
the administration. 
</P>
<P>
	Hot-rolled steel can be used as is in such applications as  
construction or turned into higher-grade products for appliances or 
automobiles. 
</P>
<P>
	Japanese hot-rolled shipments already have gone down to almost  
insignificant levels, partly because of the threat of tariffs, so 
Friday's vote was mostly about sustaining those reductions. 
</P>
<P>
	Paradoxically, a rejection of tariffs would probably have  
boosted support in the Senate for import quotas. 
</P>
<P>
	``The recognition that existing protectionist mechanisms are  
doing their job may undermine the case for additional 
protections,'' said Brink Lindsey, director of the Center for Trade 
Policy Studies at the Cato Institute. 
</P>
<P>
	Imports surged last year in the wake of the Asian economic  
crisis, which lowered demand for steel abroad and forced foreign 
producers to turn to the healthier U.S. economy. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. industry accused Japanese, Russian and Brazilian  
producers of illegally dumping hot-rolled steel in the United 
States at prices below production costs or home-market prices. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration has tentatively struck deals with  
Russia and Brazil in which those countries could avoid tariffs by 
voluntarily reducing steel shipments. 
</P>
<P>
	The foreign producers argued that the pricing trends result from  
normal market forces. They added that the U.S. industry's claims of 
harm were exaggerated because profitability and production declines 
last year followed one of the industry's best years ever.

<HEADLINE> St. Peter Seminary Moving to Neb. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENTON, Neb. (AP) -- The nation's only Roman Catholic seminary  
still emphasizing the celebration of Mass in Latin is moving to a 
conservative Nebraska diocese whose bishop once ordered people 
excommunicated for belonging to certain organizations. 
</P>
<P>
	The 60-student seminary of the U.S. branch of the Priestly  
Fraternity of St. Peter has outgrown the rented motel it uses in 
Paupack, Pa. The order broke ground in October for a new seminary 
on a hill near Lincoln and plans to start classes next year. 
</P>
<P>
	The site is in the diocese led by Bishop Fabian Bruskewitz, who  
in 1996 stirred controversy by ordering Catholics to quit groups 
such as Planned Parenthood, Catholics for a Free Choice and Masonic 
organizations. He threatened them with excommunication, the 
spiritual equivalent of the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
	Many theologians criticized the decree as too broad; no other  
bishops followed his example. And the bishop himself said people 
must use their conscience to know whether they are affected; no one 
was publicly refused the sacraments. 
</P>
<P>
	The fraternity's leader, the Rev. Arnaud Devillers, said  
Bruskewitz's excommunication order did not affect his decision to 
relocate to Nebraska. But he defended the decree, saying some of 
the groups involved deceived people by claiming they were fully 
approved by the church. 
</P>
<P>
	Devillers' group serves people who dislike changes in the church  
brought about by the Second Vatican Council in the 1960s. Known as 
Vatican II, the council said that Mass should be said in local 
languages instead of Latin and that modern culture should be 
embraced. 
</P>
<P>
	The fraternity still offers Mass in Latin, with priests facing  
away from the congregation in a ceremony that stresses the mystery 
surrounding the belief that bread and wine in the Communion 
ceremony become Jesus Christ's body and blood. 
</P>
<P>
	Scott Appleby, director of Notre Dame's Cushwa Center for the  
Study of American Catholicism, said traditionalism stressed by 
Bruskewitz and the Priestly Fraternity runs counter to the spirit 
of Vatican II. 
</P>
<P>
	``It tends to draw strict boundaries,'' Appleby said. ``A lot of  
energy is spent circling the wagons, enclave building, proving 
who's right and who's wrong.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The fraternity has grown from 12 priests at its 1988 founding in  
Europe to nearly 100 priests around the world.

<HEADLINE> IRL Ready To Race With New Rules </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) -- Indy Racing League drivers say they  
hope the excitement level remains high for Saturday's Longhorn 500, 
even though speeds will be lower. 
</P>
<P>
	Twenty-six drivers will compete in the third annual race at  
Texas Motor Speedway. 
</P>
<P>
	The IRL has decided to control speeds slightly by lowering  
maximum rpms from 10,300 to 10,000, beginning this weekend. The 
change was made as part of an effort to decrease the likelihood of 
a crash at TMS, which features a high-banked oval track. 
</P>
<P>
	In the last IRL race on a high-banked oval, three spectators  
were killed by flying debris in Concord, N.C., on May 1. 
</P>
<P>
	But even though race officials expect speeds to be at least 3  
mph below normal Saturday, the change hasn't seemed to dilute the 
enthusiasm surrounding the event. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're flying the whole way around, we never let off the gas  
and we can easily be two or three abreast,'' said Scott Sharp, who 
placed second in qualifying Thursday with an average speed of 
214.839 mph. ``So it's one of the most exciting races we 
participate in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mark Dismore will hold the pole position Saturday, thanks to his  
qualifying speed of 215.272 mph. Dismore was forced to use a backup 
car to narrowly beat out Sharp, his Kelly Racing teammate, for the 
top spot. 
</P>
<P>
	The rest of the top five positions for Saturday's race are  
filled out by Tyce Carlson, Greg Ray and Eddie Cheever, Jr. 
Defending Longhorn 500 champion Billy Boat will start in the 11th 
spot. 
</P>
<P>
	The 208-lap race is the fifth in the IRL's 11-race season, and  
drivers say they have noticed the league has become more popular. 
</P>
<P>
	``The series is gaining support and it's gaining momentum,''  
Dismore said. ``It's definitely becoming a stand-alone series.'' 
</P>
<P>
	TMS is a 1.5-mile quad-oval with 24-degree banked turn, similar  
to the track at Concord and Atlanta Motor Speedway, which was built 
for heavier and slower stock cars. IRL races have been staged at 
TMS and Concord since 1997 and at Atlanta since 1998.

<HEADLINE> Dolphin Trainers Face Fines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Animal activist Richard O'Barry, a trainer of  
Flipper the dolphin, and an associate must pay $59,500 in fines for 
endangering two dolphins by releasing them into the open sea, 
officials said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	An administrative law judge in Florida found O'Barry had  
violated the Marine Mammal Protection Act because he released the 
two dolphins without properly preparing them for survival in the 
wild after nearly a decade of captivity. 
</P>
<P>
	Barry and Good released the two Navy dolphins named Luther and  
Buck six miles off Key West, Fla., in May, 23, 1996 after they had 
been in captivity for nearly 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
	A day after the release, Luther appeared with deep lacerations  
and begging for food at a congested Key West marina. Buck was found 
two weeks later about 40 miles from where he was released and also 
had deep lacerations and was emaciated, the government said. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Barry, in a trial last February, had denied any wrongdoing and  
claimed that the two dolphins at his Sugarloaf Dolphin Sanctuary in 
the Florida Keys were adequately conditioned for release. 
</P>
<P>
	But Administrative Law Judge Peter Fitzpatrick in Key West,  
Fla., found the defendants guilty and levied $40,000 in fines 
against O'Barry and an associate, Lloyd Good III, for illegal 
transport and harassment of the two dolphins, officials said. 
O'Barry's Sugarloaf Dolphin Sanctuary was fined an additional 
$19,500 for failing to notify federal regulators of the release. 
</P>
<P>
	The defendants have 30 days to appeal the decision to the  
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. 
</P>
<P>
	``This case involves the reckless and intentional release of two  
captive dolphins by overzealous activists who had not prepared the 
animals to survive in the wild,'' said attorney Joel LaBissonniere 
of NOAA's fisheries division, which brought the original 
prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
	The agency had sought $60,000 in fines, saying that O'Barry had  
been warned the two dolphins should not be released without a 
proper scientific research permit. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither O'Barry nor Good could be reached for comment Friday.  
</P>
<P>
	Last January, when the fines were fist levied against the two  
men, O'Barry said that both Buck and Luther were ready for life in 
he wild, but that their release had been ``sabotaged'' by rival 
activists and federal biologists. ``I'm just going to ignore them 
and see what happens,'' he said then. ``In the court of public 
opinion, I can beat them because they're wrong.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Federal officials seized a third Navy dolphin from the sanctuary  
in Sugarloaf Key, Fla., which once had seven dolphins but currently 
has none.

<HEADLINE> FBI Issues E-Mail Bug Warning </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Trying to contain a destructive new software bug  
that's infected tens of thousands of computers, the FBI today 
warned users against opening any suspicious e-mail. 
</P>
<P>
	Anti-virus experts were trying to assess the damage from  
Worm.Explore.Zip, which even affected computer operations at such 
technology leaders as Microsoft, Compaq Computer and General 
Electric. 
</P>
<P>
	Worm.Explore.Zip, which was first noticed early this week,  
tricks people by disguising itself as a friendly e-mail reply 
bearing an attached file. 
</P>
<P>
	But anyone who opens that file unleashes a program that hunts  
through a computer hard drive and wipes out the contents of 
documents, spreadsheets and other important files. 
</P>
<P>
	``Because of the destructive payload delivered by this virus,  
its potential impact is significant,'' Michael A. Vatis, director 
of the FBI's National Infrastructure Protection Center, said in an 
advisory on the agency's Web site. 
</P>
<P>
	``Users should exercise caution when reading their e-mail for  
the next few days and bring unusual messages to the attention of 
their system administrator,'' Vatis said. ``The transmission of a 
virus can be a criminal matter, and the FBI is investigating.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There were signs the outbreak might be slowing, said Mark  
Zajicek, a member of the Computer Emergency Response Team technical 
staff at the Software Engineering Institute at Carnegie Mellon 
University. 
</P>
<P>
	``The number of reports is not increasing as dramatically as it  
might have,'' Zajicek said today. 
</P>
<P>
	Worm.Explore.Zip is the third major bug to sweep across the  
Internet since late March, when the Melissa virus overwhelmed 
systems with floods of e-mail. A more damaging virus named 
Chernobyl struck in late April, but did most of its harm overseas. 
</P>
<P>
	The new bug is only known to attack computers using Microsoft  
operating systems Windows 95, Windows 98, and Windows NT. Rival 
operating systems such as Macintosh and Unix apparently are not 
vulnerable. The majority of computers used Microsoft systems. 
</P>
<P>
	The bug also contaminates a computer's e-mail program and sends  
a copy of itself as a reply to any incoming e-mail. That aspect of 
the Worm.Explore.Zip makes the bug particularly threatening for 
companies with large computer networks where workers regularly zip 
e-mails back and forth. 
</P>
<P>
	``Once the virus has started within an organization, it embeds  
itself into the system,'' said Jan Kaminski, president of FastLane 
Technologies, a maker of computer network software in Halifax, Nova 
Scotia. ``There's nothing you can do until you actually remove some 
files from the machine. Switching off the machine stops it, but 
once you turn on it, the virus starts up again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Government and university anti-virus teams were trying to combat  
the outbreak, which was reportedly first detected in Israel earlier 
this week and has reached at least 12 countries. 
</P>
<P>
	Early warnings helped General Electric contain the damage  
Thursday when its system was infected, while Microsoft said it shut 
down its corporate e-mail system for two hours as a precaution. 
Compaq waged a brief battle with the bug, and computers at the 
University of Phoenix were attacked. 
</P>
<P>
	``The technicians are still assessing the damage,'' University  
of Phoenix controller Junette West said. ``There's been quite a bit 
of damage. (Almost) everything's down. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's pretty nasty,'' she added.  
</P>
<P>
	Because of the way it works, Worm.Explore.Zip actually does not  
fit the technical definition of a computer virus. Instead, software 
experts said, the bug should be classified as a ``Trojan Horse.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Either way, the bug poses a serious threat to businesses,  
government agencies and personal computer users. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have the virus,'' Rachel Albert, a spokeswoman for  
InterActive Public Relations of San Francisco, said Thursday. 
``It's terrible. A lot of people lost everything they were working 
on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Worm.Explore.Zip arrives with a friendly message: ``Hi  
(Recipient Name)! I received your e-mail and I shall send you a 
reply ASAP. Till then, take a look at the attached zipped docs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The message is harmless unless a person opens the ``zipped  
docs,'' a term referring to a compressed file sent with the e-mail. 
</P>
<P>
	By opening that file, a person unknowingly activates the virus,  
which then uses the computer's e-mail software to send a copy of 
itself to the address of any e-mail that arrives. 
</P>
<P>
	The virus also worms into a computer's hard drive and deletes  
information in files created by popular software, including the 
word processor Microsoft Word and the spreadsheet program Microsoft 
Excel.

<HEADLINE> NL Suspends Valentine for Two Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The National League saw through Bobby  
Valentine's disguise, suspending the New York Mets manager for two 
games and fining him today. 
</P>
<P>
	Valentine was ejected in the 12th inning Wednesday night by  
plate umpire Randy Marsh for arguing a catcher's interference call 
on Mike Piazza. The manager returned to the dugout with a fake 
mustache and glasses. 
</P>
<P>
	NL president Len Coleman cited league rule 5.1, which says:  
``When a manager, player, coach or trainer is put out of a game by 
an umpire, he shall leave the field immediately.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The rule goes on to say ejected personnel ``shall remain in the  
clubhouse until the game is ended or change to street clothes and 
either leave the park or take a seat in the grandstand well removed 
from the vicinity of his club's bullpen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The suspension was to start Saturday but Valentine appealed,  
meaning it will not start until after a hearing before Coleman. 
</P>
<P>
	An eight-game losing streak, the team's longest in three years,  
prompted general manager Steve Phillips to fire three of 
Valentine's coaches last Saturday, a move the manager didn't agree 
with. Two of those fired, pitching coach Bob Apodaca and hitting 
coach Tom Robson, were close to Valentine. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the firings, the Mets have won four straight.  
</P>
<P>
	In other Mets turmoil, outfielder Bobby Bonilla told the team he  
was unavailable to play in Tuesday's and Wednesday's games. 
</P>
<P>
	Bonilla, hitting .167 with four homers and 17 RBIs, didn't take  
batting practice Wednesday and exchanged bitter words with 
Valentine before the game. Last week, Bonilla was upset after a 
report the Mets placed him on waivers and he wasn't claimed. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would like it to be resolved sooner rather than later,''  
general manager Steve Phillips said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Valentine wasn't in favor of the offseason trade that brought  
Bonilla back to New York from Los Angeles, but co-owner Nelson 
Doubleday pushed for the move. Phillips sounded as if the Bonilla 
matter was troubling. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we have to look at all avenues,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Also, outfielder Benny Agbayani was cleared to return today. The  
rookie, hitting .409 with eight homers in 66 at-bats, bruised his 
right eye in batting practice Wednesday when he hit a ball off the 
cage and it bounced back into his eye. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mets said a CT scan was negative and eye specialist Dr.  
Bruce Zagelbaum said Agbayani could return tonight against Boston.

<HEADLINE> Michigan St. Player To Be Charged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KALAMAZOO, Mich. (AP) -- Michigan State tailback Little John  
Flowers will be arraigned this week on charges of gambling and 
interfering with police, court officials said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The charges stem from a June 5 encounter with police at a  
Kalamazoo park. University athletic officials say the 19-year-old 
player was caught shooting dice with friends and resisted arrest. 
He was later released on bond. 
</P>
<P>
	Flowers was named in a warrant issued Thursday, a Kalamazoo  
District court administrator said. His arraignment is June 18. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Nick Saban has suspended Flowers from the team  
indefinitely, Michigan State sports information director John 
Lewandowski said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Coach Saban will re-evaluate his status after the court  
process is completed,'' Lewandowski said. ``Since this was his 
second incident, Coach saw it fit to suspend him at this point.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 6-foot, 200-pound sophomore was expected to compete for the  
starting tailback job. 
</P>
<P>
	Flowers pleaded guilty in February to a misdemeanor charge of  
disorderly jostling in connection with a 1998 brawl. Gambling and 
interfering with a police officer are also misdemeanor charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Flowers is not the only Michigan State athlete facing criminal  
charges this summer. 
</P>
<P>
	At a hearing June 4, basketball stars Mateen Cleaves and Antonio  
Smith pleaded innocent to misdemeanor charges of larceny in 
connection with the theft of a bottle of beer from an East Lansing 
7-Eleven. 
</P>
<P>
	On June 9, fullback Bill Greene was indefinitely suspended from  
the football team after being charged with a misdemeanor related to 
the March riot in East Lansing. Green was already on probation for 
other run-ins with the law, including the 1997 theft of a dorm 
room.

<HEADLINE> Bush Launches Presidential Campaign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Texas Gov. George W. Bush launched his campaign  
for the Republican presidential nomination with two Midwest 
fund-raisers Friday and an eye toward the presidential proving 
grounds of Iowa and New Hampshire. 
</P>
<P>
	``See you in Iowa,'' he told reporters -- his only comment to the  
media -- as he jumped into a sedan after a private $1,000-a-plate 
luncheon at a downtown Chicago hotel. 
</P>
<P>
	After months of sequestering himself in Texas during the state's  
legislative session, Bush is making his first presidential campaign 
swing, leading in the polls, fund raising and expectations. He 
visits Iowa, site of the nation's first caucuses on Saturday, and 
New Hampshire, site of the first primary, on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	He still has to prove that he can withstand the rigors of the  
presidential race before solidifying his front-runner status. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was more of a down-home kind of person, funny and with a  
much better personality than his father,'' said Tina Escamilla of 
Chicago, who attended the fund-raiser as the guest of a friend. 
``His talk was a general conservative message. The only criticism 
we had was he said he could bring better times ahead, a theme that 
I think is going to be a hard sell with the economy the way it is 
now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking to an audience of more than 500 people, Bush sounded  
themes of a ``new'' Republican Party -- one ruled by ``compassionate 
conservatism.'' But he steered clear of offering specifics on what 
are expected to be key campaign issues, including education and gun 
control. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush has been accused by his presidential rivals of ducking  
difficult issues. The governor says he will begin spelling out his 
positions as he hits the campaign trail. 
</P>
<P>
	``I like the idea of compassionate conservatism, and I think  
he'll be both,'' said former Illinois Gov. Jim Edgar. ``He has the 
chance of bringing the party closer to the center, which is 
something we need to win this thing. Right now, it's definitely his 
to lose.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bush has a wide lead in the polls, the endorsement of scores of  
GOP leaders and raised $7.6 million in the first three months of 
1999, more than 11 times that of his closest potential rival for 
the nomination, Elizabeth Dole. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wouldn't say that he was anointed; I would say that he's  
proven himself so far to be the candidate of choice,'' said 
Illinois Gov. George Ryan, who helped head up the event and -- along 
with Bush -- shook the hand of each attendee. 
</P>
<P>
	Others, who dined on roast chicken, mashed potatoes and  
asparagus, said they attended the event to get a feel for what kind 
of leader Bush would be as president. 
</P>
<P>
	During the fund-raiser, Bush did not mention his stance on gun  
control, an issue likely to dog his campaign in coming months in 
the wake of recent school shootings in Colorado and Georgia. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush has said he favors background checks at gun shows but did  
not support the measure that passed the Senate with Vice President 
Al Gore's tie-breaking vote. His office said the governor thought 
an NRA-backed version of the measure was a better alternative. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush dodged about 50 anti-gun protesters -- who stood outside in  
the heat carrying signs reading, ``Go home gunslinging George'' -- 
by entering and leaving the hotel through the basement. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush has opened ``a Pandora's box he will never be able to  
close,'' said protester Mike Robbins, a former Chicago police 
officer shot 12 times with an assault weapon by an alleged gang 
member. 
</P>
<P>
	``Guns are and have been for too long, too easy to get a hold of  
in America, and it's politicians like Texas Gov. George W. Bush 
that make it possible for these conditions to exist,'' Robbins said 
to cheers. ``This is not the wild, wild west and this is not Texas. 
This is Illinois, the land of Lincoln, not Jesse James.''

<HEADLINE> Brewers Retire Molitor's No. 4 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MILWAUKEE (AP) -- Paul Molitor, who spent the first 15 years of  
his career with Milwaukee, saw his No. 4 uniform retired by the 
Brewers on Friday night to fans' cheers of ``Paulie, Paulie, 
Paulie.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The only other Brewers to have their jerseys retired are Hank  
Aaron (44), Robin Yount (19) and Rollie Fingers (34). 
</P>
<P>
	Molitor was greeted with a long standing ovation and told the  
crowd that if elected to the Hall of Fame, ``I'll be proud to go in 
as a Brewer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been embraced by the fans here, and I want to thank you  
from the bottom of my heart for that,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	In his 21-year career, which ended last season, Molitor hit .306  
with 3,319 hits, eighth on the career list. He was a five-time 
All-Star. 
</P>
<P>
	Molitor was with the Brewers from 1978-92. He is now a part-time  
broadcaster for the Minnesota Twins but said he would like to get 
more involved in ``terms of teaching or shaping'' young players for 
a team. 
</P>
<P>
	Although there was some ill feeling when he left the Brewers as  
a free agent in 1993, and again in 1996 when he chose to play for 
the Twins instead of returning to Milwaukee, Molitor said he could 
return to the Brewers one day. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd be foolish to close the doors on any avenues in this  
game,'' he said. ``I would say the door's open.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Molitor said many of his fondest memories are from his years as  
a Brewer, especially the friendships he made with Yount and Jim 
Gantner, both of whom spoke at the ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I talk about a specific year, '82 is the one that sticks  
out, believe me,'' he said, referring to the year the Brewers won 
the AL pennant and lost a seven-game World Series to St. Louis.

<HEADLINE> New Air Bags May Fail Crash Test </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- General Motors, Ford Motor and DaimlerChrysler  
say their latest, less forceful air bags -- designed to reduce 
injuries to children and small adults -- won't be able to pass a 
proposed government crash test standard that the automakers believe 
is too tough. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has proposed  
reinstating a crash test standard that requires an air bag to 
cushion an unbelted dummy when a vehicle is smashed into a wall at 
30 mph. Federal safety officials believe the test will ensure that 
air bags are protecting adults who are not wearing seat belts in 
higher-speed crashes. 
</P>
<P>
	Automakers already must comply with a 30 mph vehicle crash test  
into a wall using dummies wearing seat belts, and they believe that 
test is necessary. 
</P>
<P>
	But Robert Lange, director of engineering safety for General  
Motors Corp., on Thursday called the test for unbelted dummies ``an 
extremely severe test'' that could force automakers into air bag 
designs that are not as safe for smaller passengers. 
</P>
<P>
	In the real world, the test into an unmoving barrier translates  
into the unbelted driver of, for example, a Toyota Camry ramming 
the back of a parked Toyota Camry at 60 mph, or two Camrys hitting 
each other head-on with each car traveling at 30 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	To meet the unbelted test, the automakers argue, they will have  
to make air bags more powerful again and run the risk that children 
and short adults will be injured. Air bags have been blamed for 135 
deaths -- mostly of children and shorter women -- in low-speed 
accidents the victims otherwise should have survived, according to 
government statistics. 
</P>
<P>
	Starting in 1997, the nation's three largest automakers  
installed air bags with 25 percent to 35 percent less force, and 
they believe the less powerful air bags are doing a good job 
protecting adults in severe crashes. 
</P>
<P>
	The agency's proposed 30 mph unbelted test ``would simply take  
us back to where we were before, and we know we don't like that 
outcome,'' Lange said. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we add too much energy (to the air bag), we create the  
potential to severely injure people who would have been essentially 
injury-free,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	GM officials said they ran the 30 mph unbelted test with one of  
their vehicles and the newer, less powerful air bag failed to 
cushion the unbelted crash dummy adequately. A Ford Motor Co. 
official said Ford performed similar tests with the same result. 
DaimlerChrysler has said for months its less-powerful air bags on 
Chrysler and Dodge vehicles could fail the proposed government 
standard. 
</P>
<P>
	The government is not convinced that automakers need to add more  
power to air bags to comply with the 30 mph unbelted test, which 
was a government standard until early 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The standard was created at a time when belt use was around 15  
percent. Now it is around 70 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The test ``is necessary to ensure protection for people in the  
real world in the most difficult crashes,'' said NHTSA spokesman 
Rae Tyson. 
</P>
<P>
	NHTSA has tested 12 vehicles with redesigned air bags and found  
that only two of those would not have met the test standard, a 1998 
Dodge Neon and a 1999 Acura RL. The agency also said in a statement 
that the tests showed ``manufacturer redesign of air bags has 
resulted in slightly reduced protection of large adults.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Government data shows less than 1 percent of crashes involve a  
change of speed of 30 mph or greater.

<HEADLINE> Jury Awards Damages in Cobb Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Time Inc. must pay ex-heavyweight boxer  
Randall ``Tex'' Cobb $10.7 million for a 1993 Sports Illustrated 
article saying he fixed a fight and shared cocaine with the loser, 
a federal jury decided today. 
</P>
<P>
	Jurors awarded Cobb $2.2 million in punitive damages today to go  
with $8.5 million that they awarded Wednesday in compensatory 
damages. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. District Court jury deliberated Cobb's demand for up to  
$100 million after Judge Robert Echols ruled the panel could 
consider the financial resources of Time Inc., the magazine's 
parent, in determining the punitive damage figure. 
</P>
<P>
	When the award was announced today, Cobb shook hands with his  
attorney, who patted him on the head. 
</P>
<P>
	Cobb, 46, contended the 1993 magazine article ended his boxing  
career and nearly ended his acting career. 
</P>
<P>
	``Tex has been a prisoner of this article for six years and  
there's no better feeling in the world than to have a jury come in 
and set the record straight,'' Cobb attorney George Bochetto said. 
He said the verdict tells magazine officials ``that they did wrong 
and you better not do it again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Steve Robinson, managing editor of CNN-SI and a former Sports  
Illustrated senior editor who worked on the story, said the verdict 
``shocked us,'' adding, ``we're very confident we will prevail on 
appeal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In his closing argument to jurors earlier today, Doug Maynard, a  
Sports Illustrated lawyer, said they already had made an impact 
with the $8.5 million award. Reporters working for Time Inc. in the 
future will think about this verdict every time they write a story, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've heard your message. It's been delivered very forcefully.  
It's an earthquake for us,'' Maynard said. 
</P>
<P>
	Cobb sued in 1994 over the article headlined ``The Fix Was In.''  
The story began with an anecdote about the 1992 bout between Cobb 
and Sonny Barch, a journeyman fighter and former Memphis State 
football player. The fight ended in 70 seconds with a Cobb victory. 
</P>
<P>
	The magazine said Cobb and Barch discussed how to throw the  
fight. The story said Cobb had an injured shoulder and wanted it to 
end as quickly as possible. 
</P>
<P>
	In the article, Barch said he told Cobb: ``I'm going to have to  
hit you to make it look good. But I won't hit your shoulder.'' 
Barch said that Cobb responded: ``Bubba, I appreciate it. I'll make 
it up to you,'' according to the article. 
</P>
<P>
	Barch allowed Cobb to hit him three times, dropping to a knee  
each time and triggering the three-knockdown rule, Sports 
Illustrated reported. Cobb was declared the winner by technical 
knockout. 
</P>
<P>
	The magazine also reported that Barch said he, Cobb and a fight  
promoter shared cocaine after the bout. Sports Illustrated said 
Cobb had tested positive for cocaine use, but said in a follow-up 
item that the substance was marijuana. 
</P>
<P>
	Wayland told the jury that the article by writers William Nack  
and Sonja Steptoe was accurate and that any damage to Cobb's 
reputation was the result of his own actions. 
</P>
<P>
	``They believed the story was true. They believed it then and  
they believe it now,'' Wayland said. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Steptoe testified last month she had little evidence  
that Cobb was a willing participant in a fixed fight with Barch. 
And boxing referee Steven Smoger said Cobb showed ``excellent'' 
technique. 
</P>
<P>
	Cobb has had roles in movies including ``Liar, Liar,'' ``Raising  
Arizona,'' ``Uncommon Valor'' and ``The Golden Child.'' He has also 
been in the TV shows ``Moonlighting'' and ``MacGyver.''

<HEADLINE> Veto Threat Signals Budget Battle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration's first veto threat  
of the year against Republican-written spending legislation 
underlines that a partisan storm is brewing over needed budget 
bills. 
</P>
<P>
	The warning came Thursday shortly before the House approved its  
second spending bill of the year, a $1.92 billion measure financing 
Congress' own operations. Passage, on a near party-line 214-197 
roll call, gave House Speaker Dennis Hastert some breathing room 
for now, but many of the 13 spending measures for fiscal 2000 won't 
be nearly as easy. 
</P>
<P>
	The veto threat came in a letter to Senate leaders from White  
House budget chief Jack Lew. It objected to a $35.3 billion measure 
financing the departments of State, Commerce and Justice for the 
new fiscal year beginning Oct. 1. The Senate Appropriations 
Committee had approved the legislation earlier Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Lew's letter complained that the bill doesn't provide $1.3  
billion President Clinton wants to hire local police officers. It 
also objected to cuts in administration proposals for the 2000 
census, embassy construction and other programs. 
</P>
<P>
	``The inadequacy'' of funds led the committee ``to make choices  
that are simply unacceptable,'' Lew's letter said. He wrote that 
without changes, advisers would urge Clinton to veto the bill. 
</P>
<P>
	Even so, House GOP leaders managed to pass two spending bills in  
a week in which Hastert called for Republican unity in a dramatic 
closed-door meeting and agreed to make new cuts in several bills, 
pleasing conservatives. 
</P>
<P>
	Following through on that strategy, GOP leaders offered an  
amendment cutting $54 million from the measure financing Congress 
that passed by voice vote. 
</P>
<P>
	Top Republicans had initially planned to cut only about $26  
million from the bill, but sidestepped a fresh conservative 
rebellion by adding $28 million in cuts from the account financing 
members' own offices. Conservatives initially sought a cut totaling 
$90 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we can live with it,'' Rep. Bill Young, R-Fla., said  
of the $54 million cut. Young chairs the House Appropriations 
Committee, which wrote the bill. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats tried blocking the House from even debating the  
spending bill, hoping that enough Republicans would join them to 
succeed. They prolonged debate until nearly midnight with a parade 
of procedural votes, losing every one. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think this is a cut for cut's sake'' in which GOP leaders  
are ``continuing to pander to the right wing,'' said Rep. Steny 
Hoyer, D-Md. 
</P>
<P>
	The GOP House margin is so narrow that Democrats need defections  
from only six Republicans to prevail. They were hoping to deal a 
major embarrassment to Hastert, R-Ill., only two days after GOP 
leaders thought they had rallied their troops behind them. 
</P>
<P>
	The $28 million cut in members' office expenses would keep that  
account at $385 million, the same as this year. The original bill 
planned a 7.3 percent increase, well above the rate of inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	Defenders said the increase was necessary to cover inflation and  
to give their aides a raise. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill would also give additional money to House leadership  
offices and most committees, while providing funds to repair a 
fountain and other facilities across Capitol Hill. 
</P>
<P>
	Before passage, a provision was deleted that would have required  
House offices to begin recycling their own trash. Some Republicans 
said they oppose forcing lawmakers to recycle. 
</P>
<P>
	Across the Capitol, the Senate Appropriations Committee approved  
its own $1.7 billion version of the bill. 
</P>
<P>
	That bill covers Senate expenses and joint congressional items  
like the Capitol architect. The House bill covers House expenses 
and joint items. When combined, the price tag will be about $2.5 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate committee also approved an $8.3 billion bill  
financing military construction, and the Commerce-Justice-State 
measure. 
</P>
<P>
	The committee approved all three bills by 27-0.

<HEADLINE> Home Improvement Chain Files Ch. 11 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LARGO, Md. (AP) -- Hechinger Co., the home improvement chain that  
has struggled against rivals Home Depot Inc. and Lowe's Cos., plans 
to close 89 stores under a Chapter 11 reorganization plan filed 
Friday with U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Delaware. 
</P>
<P>
	The Largo-based retailer said it will focus on a core of 117  
healthier stores in 21 states. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the big victims was Kmart Corp., which sold its Builders  
Square chain two years ago to a venture that was combined with 
Hechinger. 
</P>
<P>
	Separately, Kmart said Friday it was reducing its earnings by  
about $230 million after taxes because it had guaranteed the 
Builders Square leases. It said that up to 115 former Builders 
Square locations may become Kmart's responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
	Hechinger said it will concentrate on larger Hechinger stores  
and its HQ-Home Quarters Warehouse outlets; the vast majority of 
the planned store closing are Builders Square stores. The company 
also plans to convert its remaining Builders Square stores to the 
Home Quarters format, under the Chapter 11 filing, which is subject 
to Bankruptcy Court approval. 
</P>
<P>
	``Filing for Chapter 11 and closing these unprofitable locations  
is the crucial first step in our efforts to remake Hechinger,'' 
said chairman Mark Adams. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts have said nervous suppliers are cutting back credit,  
intensifying Hechinger's cash problems. The credit problems come at 
a bad time for Hechinger, which is having trouble stocking store 
shelves just as homeowners are most eager to spend money for home 
and garden improvements, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
	Kenneth M. Gassman Jr., an analyst with Davenport &AMP; Co. in  
Richmond, Va., predicted that the reorganization would give 
Hechinger three years of life. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're getting to the point where they're not going to be  
able to compete successfully,'' Gassman said. ``I think they'll 
implode further.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hechinger listed $1.3 billion in assets with liabilities  
totaling $1.4 billion. Those liabilities included $323 million in 
bond debt. The company said it would also seek up to $700 million 
in financing from BankBoston Retain Finance Inc. to continue normal 
business operations during reorganization. 
</P>
<P>
	The company failed to make a $4.7 million interest payment on  
its unsecured debt May 15 and reported a loss of $228 million for 
the quarter ending April 3. 
</P>
<P>
	Builders Square was one of four subsidiaries that Kmart sold or  
spun off as part of a plan to refocus on its discount retail 
stores. Under that deal, Kmart said it would guarantee leases now 
worth $1.2 billion, of which $761 million is for Builders Square 
stores. 
</P>
<P>
	Scott Campbell, an analyst for Detroit-based Roney &AMP; Co., said  
the deal would not hurt Kmart badly, noting many of the stores are 
in desirable locations with spaces large enough to lure warehouse 
retailers such as Sam's Club or Costco. 
</P>
<P>
	``The (retailers) would love to get these spaces,'' Campbell  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Kmart stock dipped 6 1/4 cents Friday to close at $14.87 1/2 a share  
on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Founded in 1911, Hechinger grew into a Washington, D.C.  
institution and one of the first large-scale home-improvement 
chains in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
	By the early 1990s, however, it was clear that the Hechinger  
family had failed to recognize the threat posed by Home Depot and 
Lowe's, which were beginning to dot the suburbs with superstores. 
</P>
<P>
	Hechinger was sold two years ago for $507 million to Leonard  
Green &AMP; Partners, a Los Angeles investment group. At the same time, 
Hechinger combined Builders Square with two other chains to create 
the third-largest home-improvement retailer behind its two rivals. 
</P>
<P>
	Since then, Home Depot and Lowe's have added stores and boosted  
profits, while Hechinger has struggled. The company has remodeled 
stores while closing others and had 206 locations in May. 
</P>
<P>
	Gassman said Hechinger erred by not building more large stores  
in far-flung, developing suburbs and by concentrating on 
established locations closer to big cities, which suffered from 
suburban sprawl. 
</P>
<P>
	Many Hechinger outlets also suffer from undersized  
lawn-and-garden centers, narrow, poorly lit aisles, disorganized 
stock and employees that aren't knowledgeable about the company's 
products, Gassman added. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think Hechinger did not listen closely enough to their  
customers,'' Gassman said. ``Those are the kinds of things that 
turn people off.''

<HEADLINE> Microsoft Challenges Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The judge overseeing the Microsoft antitrust  
trial offered the government another reason why Microsoft should 
not bundle its Internet browser within its popular Windows 
operating system: computer viruses. 
</P>
<P>
	Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson, who will rule on the case without  
a jury, interrupted the testimony of a computer expert Thursday to 
ask whether the expert believed a browser increased the chance a 
virus could infect a computer. 
</P>
<P>
	There was, said Edward Felton, a Princeton University professor.  
</P>
<P>
	Some companies, he said, may not want computers with Web  
browsers because it could allow employees to roam freely on the 
Internet. That could be risky for more inexperienced users. 
</P>
<P>
	``It seems self-evident to me that the presence of a browser  
increases the risk of penetration of a virus,'' Jackson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Felten agreed, saying there was less chance of introducing a  
virus into a system if it did not have a browser than if it did. 
</P>
<P>
	Felten took the stand as the government's final rebuttal witness  
in the Microsoft antitrust trial. He had testified previously; last 
December he described a program he wrote that took Internet 
Explorer out of Windows 98. A modified version of that program was 
introduced as evidence Thursday shortly after Felten made his 
second appearance in the witness box. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft attorney Steve Holley immediately challenged the  
program's effectiveness, arguing that the program did not remove 
the browser from Windows, but simply hid it. To prove his point, 
Holley presented Felten with a laptop computer and asked him to 
install his new ``removal'' program. 
</P>
<P>
	Felten resisted, saying he couldn't vouch for the effectiveness  
of the program since the computer he was given was loaded with 
numerous software programs, including multiple Internet browsers. 
The computers on which he had tested his removal program were 
loaded only with Windows 98. 
</P>
<P>
	He ultimately installed the program and, afterward, followed a  
series of instructions by Holley, at the end of which another 
Internet Explorer browser appeared on the screen. 
</P>
<P>
	``What is that, Mr. Felten?'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know how it got there,'' Felten responded. He  
maintained, however, that ``the removal program is still a valid 
proof of concept.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The point of this is to show that Microsoft can do this.  
...There are many ways in which Microsoft can go about delivering 
Windows 98 without IE,'' Felten said. 
</P>
<P>
	Felten's testimony touches on a central claim in the  
government's antitrust case. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft contends that Windows and its browser are so closely  
integrated that it is impossible to remove the Web software without 
crippling Windows. The government, however, alleges that Microsoft 
illegally ``tied'' Windows and its browser to undermine Netscape 
Communications Corp., whose Web software is Microsoft's biggest 
competitor. 
</P>
<P>
	The Justice Department called upon Felten to testify again to  
help debunk previous testimony from a Microsoft executive who found 
Felten's original program full of bugs.

<HEADLINE> Steel Cos. Face Last Tariff Hurdle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- U.S. steel producers struggling from last  
year's surge in low-priced imports are looking beyond a crucial 
International Trade Commission ruling for an end to their plight. 
</P>
<P>
	The ITC was voting today on U.S. tariffs against Japan on  
hot-rolled carbon steel, the industry's leading product. If 
approved, the Clinton administration would order tariffs of as much 
as 67 percent within weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	But hot-rolled shipments from Japan already have declined,  
partly because of the threat of tariffs, which make imports more 
expensive. Today's ruling would not apply to other steel products 
or to other countries. 
</P>
<P>
	``Certainly a ruling (for tariffs) would have a positive impact,  
but the key here is that this situation has not ended,'' said 
William Klinefelter, Washington representative of the United 
Steelworkers of America union. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. industry has been pushing for stronger sanctions, such  
as quotas covering all steel products from all countries, to help 
combat imports that it blames for thousands of layoffs and 
bankruptcies at three U.S. companies. 
</P>
<P>
	Supporters are hoping for a Senate vote on quotas later this  
month. The House passed the measure in March by a 289-141 vote, 
despite the threat of a presidential veto. 
</P>
<P>
	The question before the commission was whether domestic industry  
is hurt by Japanese pricing practices already deemed illegal by the 
Commerce Department. Tariffs would be imposed if the commission 
finds actual or threatened injury. 
</P>
<P>
	Rejection of tariffs could prompt imports to rise and could  
encourage more shipments from other countries that had been looking 
for signs of what practices are permissible. A rejection also could 
boost support in Congress for global quotas. 
</P>
<P>
	Masaki Sato, president and chief executive for Nippon Steel  
U.S.A. Inc., said any attempt to restrict imports would be 
``unjustified, ill-conceived and counterproductive'' and would hurt 
U.S. steel consumers as well as Japanese producers. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. industry accused Japanese, Russian and Brazilian  
producers of illegally dumping hot-rolled steel in the United 
States at prices below production costs or home-market prices. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration has tentatively struck deals with  
Russia and Brazil in which those countries could avoid tariffs by 
voluntarily reducing steel shipments. That leaves Japan as the 
remaining target, and the Commerce Department concurred with the 
industry's charges against Japan in April. 
</P>
<P>
	The foreign producers argued that the pricing trends result from  
normal market forces, including a General Motors strike that 
lowered demand for steel in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	They also said the U.S. industry's claims of harm were  
exaggerated because any decline last year followed one of the 
industry's best years ever. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration has faced difficult choices about how  
exactly to respond to complaints from U.S. steel companies and 
workers' unions. The administration has preferred to let the trade 
complaints run their course and has been encouraged by signs of 
import reductions since November. 
</P>
<P>
	Hot-rolled shipments from Japan went down 98 percent to 7,428  
metric tons in April, compared with 405,974 in November. Although 
Japan was a leading source of imports before the U.S. industry 
filed trade complaints in September, the country accounted for less 
than 2 percent of all foreign hot-rolled steel in April.

<HEADLINE>  Prosecutor Doubts Knight's Accuser </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BLOOMINGTON, Ind. (AP) -- Bob Knight most likely will learn  
Monday if he will face assault charges, but the prosecutor has 
questioned the credibility of the coach's accuser. 
</P>
<P>
	The Indiana coach is accused of making a racist remark in a  
restaurant near the campus Monday night, then choking a patron in 
the parking lot and challenging him to fight. 
</P>
<P>
	Monroe County prosecutor Carl Salzmann could decide to file  
assault and battery charges against the 58-year-old coach. 
</P>
<P>
	The complaint was made by Chris Foster, 38, and he faces  
possible provocation charges. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm beginning to doubt the credibility of the story,''  
Salzmann said. 
</P>
<P>
	The disturbance happened at a Mexican restaurant in Elletsville.  
Foster said he had been listening to the conversation Knight was 
having with his family at a table across the room. 
</P>
<P>
	But Salzmann said Friday there were no thumb marks among the red  
welts on Foster's neck, which eliminates the possibility Knight 
lifted Foster off the ground. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have to have an opposable-thumb print,'' Salzmann said.  
</P>
<P>
	Investigators are now combing credit-card receipts seeking  
others who were at the restaurant at the time. They want to 
determine if Foster had been intentionally eavesdropping on the 
coach. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would mean the case leans more toward a provocation  
scenario, that this was intended to harass and annoy (Knight),'' 
Salzmann said. ``But I'm keeping an open mind.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A misdemeanor battery charge carries a maximum penalty of a  
$5,000 fine and six months in jail. A provocation charge carries a 
maximum $500 fine. 
</P>
<P>
	Knight, whose temper is notorious in college basketball, has  
been suspended or fined several times. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1979, Knight was tried and convicted in absentia and  
sentenced to six months in jail for hitting a Puerto Rican 
policeman at the Pan American Games. Indiana refused to extradite 
Knight and Puerto Rico eventually dropped attempts to get him back. 
</P>
<P>
	At the 1981 NCAA finals in Philadelphia, an LSU fan says Knight  
stuffed him in a garbage can. In 1985, he was ejected after 
throwing a chair across the court during a game against Purdue. 
</P>
<P>
	In the 1992 NCAA tournament, Knight playfully gave a mock  
whipping to Calbert Cheaney, a black player, during practice. 
Knight denied racial connotations to the prank.

<HEADLINE> Georgetown Academic Adviser Quits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Now that John Thompson has quit as  
Georgetown's basketball coach, Mary Fenlon is leaving, too. 
</P>
<P>
	Fenlon, the team's tough-love academic adviser for 27 years, is  
retiring July 31. The announcement was made earlier this week at a 
university function. 
</P>
<P>
	Fenlon's retirement follows Thompson's sudden decision to resign  
for personal reasons in January. 
</P>
<P>
	Fenlon, a former nun, was the first person Thompson hired when  
he took over the struggling Hoyas program in 1972. She was also the 
person Thompson chose to accompany him when he visited possible 
recruits, and she kept a tight rein on the schedules and academic 
progress of the players. 
</P>
<P>
	Under Fenlon, 97 percent of the players who stayed four years  
received their degrees. 
</P>
<P>
	``She'd curse you out if you messed up,'' New York Knicks center  
and Georgetown alumnus Patrick Ewing once said. ``And if you needed 
a pat on the back, she'd pat you on the back. Mary is just a great 
lady.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fenlon rarely granted interviews and was protective of the  
players, often making sure reporters did not stray beyond the 
school's strict coverage rules. 
</P>
<P>
	Fenlon sat on or near the bench for Georgetown's games, and she  
and Thompson often traveled together to watch NBA games featuring 
Ewing or other former Georgetown players. Earlier this year, The 
Washington Post revealed that Fenlon and Thompson had become 
business partners in various real estate investments in Las Vegas. 
</P>

	Thompson and Fenlon often haggled over how players should divide  
their time between schoolwork and practice. More than once, 
Thompson would get upset because Fenlon wouldn't approve a 
suggested practice time because too many of her students -- she did 
not call them ``players'' -- would have to miss class. 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview in 1996, Thompson explained his relationship  
with Fenlon.

	``I made her promise me when I first came here, that I wanted  
these kids to graduate, and that I did not trust my own competitive 
instincts,'' Thompson said. ``My competitive instincts are to win,

what I'm asking you to do.'''

<P>
	MAPLEWOOD, N.J. (AP) -- When opportunity knocks, answer with open  
arms, hip-hop diva Lauryn Hill told students at her old high 
school. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want you all to know that there are vast opportunities you  
can tap into. You just have to believe in yourself and start to do 
it. Do what you have to, to increase your mind,'' the singer said 
at an unannounced appearance Thursday at Columbia High School to be 
inducted into its hall of fame. 
</P>
<P>
	Hill, who won five Grammys this year, delighted students with  
impromptu a cappella versions of her songs ``Doo Wop (That Thing)'' 
and ``Ex-Factor'' during assembly. 
</P>
<P>
	``She just touched me a lot,'' said teary-eyed Mara Ostfeld, 18.  
``She is just a great role model.'' 
</P>

	The 24-year-old former singer with the Fugees still lives in  
nearby South Orange with fiance Rohan Marley and her mother.

<HEADLINE>  Russia Wants Own Kosovo Peace Area </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- Russia dispatched a column of troops and armored  
vehicles to Yugoslavia today, and its foreign minister said the 
forces were preparing to enter Kosovo, even though their 
peacekeeping role was still being negotiated. 
</P>
<P>
	Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov did not say when the Russian forces  
might enter Kosovo, but stressed that none had done so yet. He 
described the Russian troop movement as ``preparatory actions'' to 
aid in peacekeeping. 
</P>
<P>
	Russian leaders have provided scant information about the  
movement of their troops, though Russian forces have traveled out 
of Bosnia and through the Yugoslav capital of Belgrade, heading 
south to Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	Vice President Gore and Secretary of State Madeleine Albright  
said they had received assurances from Moscow that no Russian 
forces would go into Kosovo until there was agreement on how the 
NATO and Russian forces would cooperate on the international 
peacekeeping force. 
</P>
<P>
	If Russian forces were to enter Kosovo before such an agreement,  
it could complicate efforts to establish the force in a unified 
manner. NATO says it will lead the force and will be present in all 
parts of Kosovo. The alliance is opposed to Moscow's idea of a 
special Russian sector, and does not want Russia unilaterally 
staking out its own territory in Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, Russia is an ally of Yugoslavia, and ethnic Albanian  
refugees returning to Kosovo might be reluctant to move into an 
area dominated by Russian troops. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia and the United States held a second day of talks today to  
work out how NATO and Russian troops would work together in the 
50,000-strong peacekeeping force in Kosovo, which was authorized by 
the United Nations on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The talks broke up without agreement and Deputy Secretary of  
State Strobe Talbott flew out of Moscow. But when news broke about 
Russian troop movements toward Kosovo, Talbott returned for a new 
round of urgent talks. 
</P>
<P>
	The Interfax news agency, citing unidentified sources, claimed  
about 1,000 Russians would be leaving this afternoon and flying to 
cities in Kosovo, including the capital Pristina. The Russian units 
were already at military airfields and were waiting for orders to 
take off, a source told Interfax. 
</P>
<P>
	Ivanov said no Russia troops were yet in Kosovo. He did say,  
however, that ``active preparatory actions are taking place for the 
deployment of a (Russian) presence in Kosovo.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Since the deployment of the international peacekeeping force  
in Kosovo may take place within days, a high degree of readiness is 
needed,'' Ivanov added. 
</P>
<P>
	An AP photographer in Yugoslavia saw a Russian convoy west of  
Belgrade. The independent Yugoslav news agency Beta reported that a 
convoy of Russian troops had crossed from Bosnia into Serbia en 
route to Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russian vehicles were marked KFOR, the insignia of the  
Kosovo peacekeeping force. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore said he expected the Russians to stop short of Kosovo,  
telling the CNN: ``We've been given absolute assurances they will 
not move into Kosovo.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That suggested the Russians were moving close -- but not into --  
the province in preparation for a later deployment. 
</P>
<P>
	Russian leaders have said they are considering sending a total  
of 2,500 to 10,000 troops to Kosovo -- but they will not be placed 
under NATO command. 
</P>
<P>
	A Russian general said today that Moscow should be given its own  
peacekeeping sector in Kosovo, or else it would bypass NATO and 
work out its own arrangement with Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't intend to beg the American side to provide Russia  
with a relevant sector in Kosovo,'' said Russian Gen. Leonid 
Ivashov. If an agreement can't be reached, ``we will declare our 
sector and agree on this question with the Yugoslav side.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Russia was negotiating with the United States in part because  
President Boris Yeltsin suspended relations with NATO after its 
bombing campaign began in March. The Russian leader has endorsed 
the peace plan, but is not ready to restore ties with NATO. 
</P>
<P>
	``Relations between Russia and NATO ... remain frozen,'' Yeltsin  
said. ``We shall see later what happens.''

<HEADLINE> Astros, TV Station Make Statement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- Houston Astros owner Drayton McLane Jr. and the  
television executive who accused him of making offensive remarks 
issued a joint statement Friday, saying the community ``should put 
this issue behind us and move forward.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Marco Camacho, the general manager of KTMD-TV, Houston's  
Telemundo affiliate, had accused McLane of saying the Astros don't 
market to Hispanics because they don't understand baseball and only 
buy tickets in the cheap seats. 
</P>
<P>
	After meeting privately with McLane Friday, Camacho backed off  
his allegations. 
</P>
<P>
	``I find him to be an honorable man and a man of integrity,''  
Camacho said in the statement. ``It is now clear that Mr. McLane is 
not biased or insensitive toward the Hispanic community.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Camacho accused McLane of making the remarks to him and several  
others at a Houston Advertising Federation banquet. McLane said his 
remarks were taken out of context, and three witnesses also 
disputed Camacho's account. 
</P>
<P>
	``At no time did I make any biased or derogatory remarks and  
none were intended regarding Hispanics or the Hispanic community,'' 
McLane said in the statement. 
</P>
<P>
	The statement said the Astros would increase efforts to reach  
out to the Hispanic community, and that the Spanish language 
station will support outreach programs through public service 
announcements.

<HEADLINE> Computer Crash Halts eBay Auctions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- MarGee Charlier knew her business was in  
trouble when she logged in first thing Friday morning and saw that 
eBay, the venerable online auction site, had crashed. 
</P>
<P>
	``Devastation,'' she said. ``Disaster.''  
</P>
<P>
	Charlier, of Kewaunee, Wis., supports her small business by  
selling between 50 to 100 antiques -- bringing in between $2,000 and 
$4,000 -- each day through the site. But not on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	All bidding was suspended at eBay as the so-called ``personal  
trading community'' with more than 3 million users in 50 countries 
struggled to rebuild a corrupted computer server. 
</P>
<P>
	The halt, which came after eBay tried to launch a revamped  
version of its site, disrupted bidding on millions of collectibles 
and curios, from military medals to mandolins. 
</P>
<P>
	``We do realize how frustrating this is for our community, and  
we are doing our best to ensure that the system is restored as 
quickly and efficiently as humanly possible,'' said eBay spokesman 
Kevin Pursglove on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Bidding was stopped Thursday around 11 p.m. EDT and is not  
expected to start up again until Friday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	EBay users were met at the site with a continuing stream of  
updates and apologies from management. ``Thank you so much for your 
patience as we resolve this unfortunate situation,'' said one 
message Friday morning. 
</P>
<P>
	The apologies weren't worth much to Sharon Doney in Severn, Md.,  
who is trying to raise $250,000 this year through online auctions 
of records and books to cover medical bills for her failing liver. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is frustrating,'' she said. ``Say you were at a real  
auction and the auctioneer just walked away for a while. It just 
doesn't work.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Doney said that problems on eBay -- short crashes, slowdowns and  
postponed auction endings -- during the past few months have already 
prompted her to branch out into other auction sites, including eBay 
competitors Amazon.com and Yahoo! 
</P>
<P>
	John Dodge, editor of PC Week, said the company has had ``daily  
failures every few weeks, but this one is the biggest.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One of eBay's worst previous outages, which lasted about six  
hours, prevented the company from holding auctions of just-released 
merchandise tied to the latest ``Star Wars'' movie. 
</P>
<P>
	The site outage was unrelated to the Worm.Explore.Zip computer  
bug, which began infecting systems across the country this week. 
</P>
<P>
	Andrew Bartels, senior research analyst at Cambridge,  
Mass.-based Giga Information Group, said outages should be expected 
in this type of burgeoning emerging technology. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's actually not that big of a deal,'' he said. ``This is  
still new technology and these high transaction sites will 
periodically go down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bartels said that eBay traders have less to lose than online  
stock brokers, who have also experienced site crashes in recent 
weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	But eBay users said the effect of the crash radiated well beyond  
the people who buy and sell trinkets on eBay. 
</P>
<P>
	Jeff Schlicht of San Mateo, Calif., whose software program  
called AuctionPoster makes it easy to list dozens or hundreds of 
items on eBay, said his customers thought there must be something 
wrong with his own program. 
</P>
<P>
	``EBay is definitely having growing pains, and that's a big  
problem for me,'' he said. ``I can't make excuses for them, but I 
depend on them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``This is going to be a big boost for Amazon,'' he added.  
``Every single time stuff like this happens, customers start asking 
me when I'm going to design a system for another auction site.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Casual users appeared less affected, however.  
</P>
<P>
	Frank DeCaro, a writer in New York City who has bought  
everything from diet books to super hero glasses through eBay, said 
the crash would save him time and money. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you're buying junk, it's almost a blessing in disguise  
that you can't get to it,'' he said. ``It's really another day with 
a little less clutter for me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ebay is supposed to run 24 hours a day, seven days a week. It  
lists more than 2 million items, including antiques, books, 
computers, toys and sports memorabilia that can be purchased 
through a bidding process. 
</P>
<P>
	The company has struggled to keep up with a huge surge in demand  
-- registered users went from 1.2 million last fall to 3.8 million 
as of March 31. Those users bought and sold more than $541 million 
in merchandise through 22.9 million separate transactions during 
the first quarter of this year. EBay makes its money by taking a 
percentage on each sale. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first quarter of its 1999 fiscal year, eBay reported the  
increased volume on its Web site boosted its quarterly profit to 
$5.9 million, or 5 cents per share, making it one of the few 
consistently profitable Internet companies. 
</P>
<P>
	The company's stock has been traded publicly since late  
September, and its stock rocketed from $8.43 3/4 a share to $234 by 
April, but has since fallen by more than 20 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	However, news of the site outage sent shares tumbling more than  
8 percent Friday. By midafternoon, eBay was trading down $15.18 3/4 to 
$167.50.

<HEADLINE> New Twist to Smirnov Vs. Smirnoff </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The Russian distillers of Smirnov vodka have  
appealed a federal court's dismissal of their $1 billion 
trademark-infringement lawsuit against the business that sells 
Smirnoff vodka in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	A U.S. District Court judge in Wilmington, Del., had dismissed  
the lawsuit last month, saying the Russians had waited too long to 
make the claim and were not selling their vodka in the United 
States anyway. 
</P>
<P>
	An appeal was filed Thursday in the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of  
Appeals in Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
	The appeal was filed on behalf of the Joint Stock Society, whose  
principal owners claim to be descendants of Piotr Smirnov, and its 
distributor, the Russian American Spirits Co. 
</P>
<P>
	Smirnov was the Russian distiller who first produced Smirnov  
vodka nearly 140 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit is against UDV North America, the successor to  
Heublein Inc. and a part of the British beverage company Diageo 
PLC. UDV markets Smirnoff vodka -- Heublein adopted the French 
spelling of Smirnov -- in the U.S. and elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
	Piotr Smirnov opened his vodka distillery in 1860 and passed it  
on to his five sons. His son Piotr eventually bought out his 
brothers' stakes. 
</P>
<P>
	But the company was nationalized after the 1917 Bolshevik  
revolution and the new government quit using the Smirnov name. 
</P>
<P>
	Another son, Vladimir, began making vodka under the family name  
in 1923, court documents said, but other members of the family 
never formally objected. 
</P>
<P>
	That business was eventually sold to Heublein in 1939.  
</P>
<P>
	Currently, Smirnoff vodka is the most popular brand of vodka in  
the United States, where about 6 million cases are sold each year. 
</P>
<P>
	The Joint Stock Society began contracting with Russian vodka  
makers five years ago to produce and sell vodka under the Smirnov 
name and filed the suit in 1995 for damages. 
</P>
<P>
	But Judge Gregory Sleet in Wilmington dismissed the suit on May  
13, citing the ``years of inaction'' by the Russians. He also said 
the Russians had not tried to sell their vodka in the United States 
and would not have a claim to financial damages until they did so. 
</P>
<P>
	Jack Shea, a spokesman for UDV North America, said the company  
is confident the court's decision will be upheld.

<HEADLINE> Labonte Likes Chances in Mich. Race </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BROOKLYN, Mich. (AP) -- Last week, Bobby Labonte won a pole with  
a borrowed set of shocks, and it led to his first Winston Cup 
victory of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	Now it's a new week, a new track and a different sort of  
challenge for Labonte and the Pontiac he drives for the Joe Gibbs 
team. Still, he was certain the car's setup would be the key in 
today's qualifying for Sunday's running of the NASCAR Kmart 400 at 
Michigan Speedway. 
</P>
<P>
	``You've got to get your car set up right here,'' Labonte said  
Thursday. ``That's the big thing, to get good power and a good 
setup. I'll tell you, we've been pretty fortunate, we've run pretty 
well every time we've been here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Labonte, who won twice at this 2-mile banked oval in 1995, had  
been running fairly well all season for the Gibbs team. But he 
hadn't been winning. 
</P>
<P>
	Then it all came together last week when he drove the Pontiac to  
a victory at Dover, Del. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, he'd like to win at Michigan again.  
</P>
<P>
	``Well, confidence means a lot in racing, just like it does in  
other sports,'' Labonte said. ``We were able to build off past 
weeks to get to last week. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's nothing wrong with coming in to Michigan with a win  
last weekend, no matter where it was at.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The difference at Dover was a set of shocks Labonte borrowed  
from teammate Tony Stewart's car. 
</P>
<P>
	They worked so well that Labonte set a track record at Dover  
Downs International Speedway while earning the pole for the MBNA 
Platinum 400. 
</P>
<P>
	Like most smart NASCAR drivers, Labonte gives much of the credit  
to Jimmy Makar, his crew chief since 1995 when he joined the Gibbs 
team. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides setting the car up right, Makar also made a key call  
during the race that ultimately sealed the triumph. Makar brought 
in Labonte to top off his fuel tank just before the end of the 
final caution period on lap 293. 
</P>
<P>
	It was just enough to get him to the end.  
</P>
<P>
	``I don't like gas-mileage racing because you want to have the  
fastest car and run away,'' Labonte said. ``But it was a great call 
by Jimmy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The decision cost Jeff Gordon the Dover race for the second  
straight year. He was forced to stop for a splash of gas with five 
laps remaining. 
</P>
<P>
	Labonte is hoping to win on pure power at the bigger, faster  
track in Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's one of those deals where we like coming to this track,''  
Labonte said. ``It seems like we've got a good setup for it and 
good combination for it between Jimmy Makar and myself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Labonte heads into this weekend third in the Winston Cup point  
standings with 1,915. Dale Jarrett is first with 1,984 points and 
Jeff Burton, a three-time winner, has 1,933 points. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've been competitive week in and week out,'' Labonte said.  
``We've had some pretty decent finishes, and we haven't had too 
much bad luck. We hope we can keep it going.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mark Martin, the defending champion in this race -- the 14th of  
34 this season -- is fourth in the standings with 1,854 points. 
Martin, after a career-best seven victories last year, has won just 
once this season. 
</P>
<P>
	Like Gordon, he could be in the right place to start making  
things happen. Martin, second to Gordon last season, has won four 
times at Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
	Labonte's teammate, Stewart, is fifth with 1,700 points. Last  
year's Winston Cup points champion, Jeff Gordon, is a distant sixth 
with 1,645 points. 
</P>
<P>
	Gordon, who has had a run of bad luck lately, won at Michigan  
last August.

<HEADLINE> Judge Considers Damages in SI Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- A federal judge is deciding whether  
Sports Illustrated alone is responsible for paying punitive damages 
for former boxer Randall ``Tex'' Cobb. 
</P>
<P>
	The issue is whether the magazine's parent, Time Inc., also can  
be held liable for the damages. 
</P>
<P>
	A jury has already awarded Cobb $8.5 million in compensatory  
damages as a result of his libel suit against the magazine. The 
jury was to begin determining punitive damages today. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Robert Echols heard arguments today over  
whether the damages should come from just Sports Illustrated or 
from its parent. 
</P>
<P>
	Sports Illustrated's attorneys told the judge the lawsuit was  
solely against Sports Illustrated, which has its own accounting 
division. 
</P>
<P>
	But Cobb's attorney said the magazine can not be separated from  
Time Inc. and that several of the parent company's resources were 
used in researching the story. 
</P>
<P>
	The jury must decide how much more the magazine should pay Cobb  
as punishment for a 1993 article that said the boxer fixed a fight 
and shared cocaine with the loser. 
</P>
<P>
	The jury awarded the compensatory damages Wednesday.  
</P>
<P>
	Cobb, 46, had asked for $50 million in compensatory damages and  
$100 million in punitive damages. Cobb, who declined to comment 
Thursday, has said the article ended his boxing career and nearly 
ended his acting career. 
</P>
<P>
	``Tex has been a prisoner of this article for six years and  
there's no better feeling in the world than to have a jury come in 
and set the record straight,'' Cobb's attorney, George Bochetto, 
said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	An attorney for the magazine, Eddie Wayland, had no comment  
Thursday about the award. 
</P>
<P>
	Cobb sued in 1994 over an article headlined ``The Fix Was In.''  
The story began with an anecdote about the 1992 bout between Cobb 
and Sonny Barch, a journeyman fighter and former Memphis State 
football player. 
</P>
<P>
	The magazine reported that Cobb and Barch discussed how to throw  
the fight. The story said Cobb had an injured shoulder and wanted 
it to end as quickly as possible. 
</P>
<P>
	In the article, Barch said he told Cobb: ``I'm going to have to  
hit you to make it look good. But I won't hit your shoulder.'' 
Barch told Sports Illustrated that Cobb responded: ``Bubba, I 
appreciate it. I'll make it up to you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Barch allowed Cobb to hit him three times, dropping to a knee  
each time and triggering the three-knockdown rule, Sports 
Illustrated reported. Cobb was declared the winner by technical 
knockout. 
</P>
<P>
	The magazine also reported that Barch said he, Cobb and a fight  
promoter shared cocaine after the bout. Sports Illustrated said 
Cobb had tested positive for cocaine use, but said in a follow-up 
item that it was marijuana. 
</P>
<P>
	Wayland told the jury that the article by writers William Nack  
and Sonja Steptoe was accurate and that any damage done to Cobb's 
reputation was the result of his own actions. 
</P>
<P>
	``They believed the story was true. They believed it then and  
they believe it now,'' Wayland said. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Ms. Steptoe testified last month she had little  
evidence that Cobb was a willing participant in a fixed fight with 
Barch. 
</P>
<P>
	Since he quit fighting, Cobb has had roles in several movies,  
including ``Liar, Liar, ``Raising Arizona,'' ``Uncommon Valor'' and 
``The Golden Child.'' He has also been in the TV shows 
``Moonlighting'' and ``MacGyver.''

<HEADLINE> Villanova Gets Kentucky Transfer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	VILLANOVA, Pa. (AP) -- Center Michael Bradley, who set a school  
record for field goal percentage at Kentucky last season, has 
transferred to Villanova, the school announced Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The 6-foot-10 Bradley, a native of Worcester, Mass., started all  
37 games at Kentucky as a sophomore last season, averaging 9.8 
points and 4.9 rebounds in 21.9 minutes. He shot 65.7 percent from 
the field as the Wildcats finished 28-9, falling one game short of 
a fourth straight Final Four appearance. 
</P>
<P>
	He announced his decision to transfer on April 29, and on Friday  
made it official that he will play for Villanova. He will sit out 
the 1999-2000 season, then have two years' eligibility remaining. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley had originally decided to attend Boston College, like  
Villanova a member of the Big East, out of high school. He signed 
with Kentucky, a member of the Southeastern Conference, after 
then-Boston College coach Jim O'Brien resigned over a flap with the 
school's administration concerning admissions. 
</P>
<P>
	Villanova finished 21-11 last season, losing to Mississippi in  
the opening round of the NCAA tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	``We feel Michael's skills fit in perfectly with our style of  
basketball,'' Villanova coach Steve Lappas said Friday night. 
``There is no doubt we are looking forward to the time when Michael 
becomes eligible to play for us.''

<HEADLINE> Tirade Detailed at Profanity Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	STANDISH, Mich. (AP) -- The fiancee of a man who could go to jail  
for allegedly cussing a blue streak after tumbling out of his canoe 
offered conflicting testimony today about what he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Timothy Boomer's fiancee, Courtney Kageff, initially said she  
didn't remember Boomer using any profanity. But when pressed by the 
prosecution, she testified that she remembered him using some foul 
language, but didn't recall how many words he used. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't remember what he said,'' Ms. Kageff testified.  
</P>
<P>
	When the court broke for lunch, the defense said it had five  
more witnesses to call. Attorneys said they hoped the jury would 
get the case today. 
</P>
<P>
	The prosecution rested its case earlier today against Boomer,  
charged with violating Michigan's century-old ban on swearing in 
front of children. If convicted of the misdemeanor, he could be 
jailed for 90 days and fined $100. 
</P>
<P>
	The trial began Thursday in Arenac County District Court, with  
three prosecution witnesses graphically repeating a string of 
expletives they said an enraged Boomer shouted after his Aug. 15, 
1998, mishap on the Rifle River. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was screaming,'' said Kenneth Socia, the former deputy  
sheriff who ticketed Boomer. 
</P>
<P>
	The tirade lasted five to seven minutes, during which Boomer  
yelled a particular word and its derivatives perhaps two dozen 
times, Socia said. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense lawyer William Street acknowledged his client may have  
uttered a profanity or two but said: ``Timothy Boomer did not 
disrespect anyone's rights that day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Street contended the 25-year-old computer programmer from the  
Detroit suburb Roseville did not know children were nearby. ``You 
cannot in good conscience label him a criminal,'' he told the jury 
</P>
<P>
	Street said Boomer was being unjustly blamed for years of  
misconduct by others on the river about 130 miles north of Detroit, 
a popular attraction for tourists from southern Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
	Curious spectators and reporters packed the cramped basement  
courtroom for the trial -- broadcast live by Court TV -- in a case 
that has drawn nationwide attention as an example of the clash 
between free-speech rights and the struggle for a more courteous 
society. 
</P>
<P>
	Street is defending Boomer on behalf of the American Civil  
Liberties Union, which contends the 1897 anti-profanity law is 
unconstitutional. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael and Tammy Smith supported Socia's version of events,  
saying they came up behind Boomer's canoe as it struck a rock, 
sending him into the water. 
</P>
<P>
	Instructed by the prosecutor and judge to repeat Boomer's exact  
words, a visibly uncomfortable Michael Smith yelled a string of 
expletives followed by, ``I'm tired of this ... place. I want off 
this ... river. Get that ... canoe back here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Boomer continued the barrage for several minutes as he trudged  
through the waist-deep Rifle River in pursuit of his companions, 
who were riding in five canoes tied together with bungee cords, 
Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Smith told jurors she covered her 2-year-old daughter's  
ears and admonished her 5-year-old son not to listen to Boomer as 
her husband paddled around him and sped away. 
</P>
<P>
	Socia testified that Boomer continued cursing as Socia wrote him  
a ticket.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Won't Get Honorary Degree </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- No offense, University of Chicago officials say,  
but President Clinton won't get an honorary degree for speaking to 
graduates Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	He doesn't even qualify to give the commencement address.  
Instead, he will be the ``distinguished guest speaker.'' 
</P>
<P>
	University officials said it has nothing to do with the  
president and everything to do with strict tradition at this very 
serious institution, where more Nobel laureates -- 70 in all -- have 
taught, researched or studied than anywhere else in the world. 
</P>
<P>
	Rules at the 108-year-old school allow only faculty members to  
give the commencement address and only leading academic scholars 
get honorary degrees. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not a snub to either the office of the president or  
President Clinton,'' university spokesman Larry Arbeiter said. 
``Other elite universities will give honorary degrees to 
entertainers or sports figures, but we don't do it. We are a bit 
more restrictive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The university also rejected a proposal to give Queen Elizabeth  
II an honorary law degree when she visited in 1959. 
</P>
<P>
	``Their response was, `Of course we would be happy to consider  
the Queen of England. Please submit to us a list of her scholarly 
publications,''' Arbeiter said. 
</P>
<P>
	A White House spokeswoman called Clinton's billing ``a question  
of semantics.''

<HEADLINE>  Irvine Leads Formula One Practice </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MONTREAL (AP) -- Even with a final lap miscue, Eddie Irvine still  
beat out Ferrari teammate Michael Schumacher on Friday and led both 
practice sessions for the Canadian Grand Prix. 
</P>
<P>
	``I only made one mistake and I was pleased with myself until  
then,'' Irvine said, referring to a harmless spin in the afternoon 
session. ``My last lap should have been my best, but I used too 
much of the curb at one point.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Irishman got around the 2.747-mile, 13-turn Circuit Gilles  
Villeneuve in 1 minute, 20.576 seconds. That was .700-second 
quicker than the 1:20.664 by McLaren-Mercedes driver David 
Coulthard of Scotland -- last year's Canadian pole-winner -- and 
.934-second faster than Schumacher's 1:21.276. 
</P>
<P>
	Schumacher, the defending race winner, was very confident after  
Friday's action. 
</P>
<P>
	``Tomorrow we will use our new engine for the first time in  
qualifying,'' the German said. ``I expect we will be very 
competitive in qualifying and in the race, as this circuit suits 
our car.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jean Alesi, the 1995 Canada winner, was fourth overall at  
1:21.510 in a Sauber-Petronas, followed by Giancarlo Fisichella's 
Benetton-Playlife at 1:21.724. 
</P>
<P>
	Riccardo Zonta, a 23-year-old Brazilian, made an impressive  
return to action following a three-race layoff while recuperating 
from a broken foot. The youngster put his British American Racing 
entry sixth at 1:21.810, beating out defending Formula One champion 
Mika Hakkinen, who struggled to a 1:21.950 in the other Team 
McLaren entry. 
</P>
<P>
	Hakkinen, who trails Schumacher by six points in the battle for  
the 1999 series title, does not enjoy racing on the Canadian 
circuit. 
</P>
<P>
	``This track is just weird,'' the Finnish driver said. ``I've  
never got it right, to be honest. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a challenge. If I get it right, I'll be very  
pleased.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even further off pace than Hakkinen was Team Williams driver  
Alex Zanardi, the CART champion each of the past two years. 
</P>
<P>
	Zanardi, who was an immediate starter when he joined the  
American-based series in 1996, has struggled badly so far in his 
less-than-triumphant return to Formula One. 
</P>
<P>
	In Friday's practice, Zanardi was 18th at 1:23.824.  
</P>
<P>
	``I certainly miss the competitiveness of the car I had  
underneath me last year (in CART),'' the Italian driver said. 
``But, having said that, the Winfield-Williams team is a great 
organization and nobody on the team is happy with the performance 
of the car right now. 
</P>
<P>
	``I still have something to learn about driving the car on these  
grooved tires, which is the feature that has changed the handling 
of the cars most dramatically since I was last in F1 (in 1994).'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jacques Villeneuve, another former CART champion and Zonta's BAR  
teammate, was ninth at 1:22.021 -- a performance the Canadian-born 
local favorite considered mediocre. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're finding some things out to make the car better, but it's  
very difficult,'' Villeneuve said. ''

<HEADLINE> Asian Stock Markets Close Mixed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- Asian stock markets ended the week generally  
mixed Friday, with prices rising both in Tokyo and Hong Kong. 
</P>
<P>
	Japanese stocks rose after the Economic Planning Agency's  
announcement Thursday that Japan's economy grew 1.9 percent, or 7.9 
percent on an annualized basis, in the first quarter of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	The numbers marked Japan's first expansion after five quarters  
of contraction. The country is struggling with its deepest 
recession since the end of World War II. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average gained 95.93  
points, or 0.56 percent, to close at 17,198.55. On Thursday, the 
average finished up 480.12 points, or 2.89 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In the morning, the Nikkei rose as high at 17483.38, its highest  
intraday level since October 1997, before slipping back down. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the U.S. dollar was quoted at 118.66 yen, down 0.46  
yen from late Thursday in Tokyo and below its late New York level 
of 118.84 yen overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	In Hong Kong, the blue-chip Hang Seng Index rose 153.55 points,  
or 1.2 percent, closing at 12,992.76. On Friday, the index lost 
35.21 points, or 0.3 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Brokers attributed the rise to Wednesday's cut in interest rates  
by China, which boosted the shares of companies in Hong Kong with 
business ties on the Chinese mainland. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of Cathay Pacific Airways rose sharply after the airline  
reached an agreement with its pilots over a pay dispute that caused 
the cancellation of a large number of flights. Cathay shares rose 
6.7 percent to close at 12.75 Hong Kong dollars (U.S. $1.63). 
</P>
<P>
	Fears of a rise in U.S. interest rates were discounted by the  
market, brokers said. The United States was to release its producer 
price index later Friday, which will provide clues about whether 
there will be a rise in rates. 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere:  
</P>
<P>
	SINGAPORE: Share prices closed higher on the back of heavy  
institutional buying, dealers said. The benchmark Straits Times 
Index rose 37.17 points, or 1.8 percent, to 2,067.17. 
</P>
<P>
	TAIPEI: Share prices closed lower for the first time this month  
on concerns that the U.S. stock market's strength could be waning. 
The market's key Weighted Stock Price Index fell 17.36 points, or 
0.21 percent, to 7,979.40. 
</P>
<P>
	WELLINGTON: New Zealand share prices closed slightly lower. The  
benchmark NZSE-40 Capital Index fell 8.34 points, or 0.3 percent, 
to 2,120.11. 
</P>
<P>
	MANILA: Philippine shares closed mixed as investors awaited key  
U.S. economic data due for release later in the day. The Philippine 
Stock Exchange index of 30 selected companies fell 5.11 points, or 
0.2 percent, to 2,367.79. 
</P>
<P>
	SYDNEY: The Australian share market closed lower amid fears of  
higher inflation and an interest rate hike in the United States. 
The All Ordinaries Index fell 28.4 points, or 0.95 percent, to 
2,950.2. 
</P>
<P>
	SEOUL: Share prices closed mixed. The Korea Composite Stock  
Price Index fell 7.45 points, or 0.8 percent, to 848.61. 
</P>
<P>
	KUALA LUMPUR: Malaysian share prices closed mostly higher as  
investors bought on speculation about a snap general election. The 
Composite Index, which tracks 100 key stocks, rose 5.07 points, or 
0.6 percent, to 772.76. 
</P>
<P>
	JAKARTA: Indonesian share prices closed higher on cautious  
optimism that the vote count in the country's election, although 
slow, will be smooth. The Composite Index rose 3.712 points, or 0.5 
percent, to 668.281. 
</P>
<P>
	BANGKOK: Thailand's benchmark index closed lower due to profit  
taking. The Stock Exchange of Thailand index fell 4.38 points, or 
0.8 percent, to 507.06.

of the cars most dramatically since I was last in F1 (in 1994).'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jacques Villeneuve, another former CART champion and Zonta's BAR  
teammate, was ninth at 1:22.021 -- a performance the Canadian-born 
local favorite considered mediocre. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're finding some things out to make the car better, but it's  
very difficult,'' Villeneuve said. ''

<HEADLINE> If Knicks Win, Coach Reaps Millions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Jeff Van Gundy stands to make millions if the  
Knicks make it to the NBA Finals. 
</P>
<P>
	An option year in Van Gundy's contract worth $3.5 million  
becomes guaranteed if he leads his team out of the Eastern 
Conference finals, and he also would reportedly receive a $500,000 
bonus. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't really care what's in there, I just want to win,'' Van  
Gundy said Friday after the Knicks held their shootaround in 
preparation for Game 6 against the Indiana Pacers. 
</P>
<P>
	New York led 3-2 in the best-of-7 series entering Friday night's  
game. 
</P>
<P>
	Van Gundy's potential windfall headlined the front page of one  
of the city's tabloids Friday along with a rare photo of Van Gundy 
smiling. 
</P>
<P>
	The dour-faced coach, in his fourth season running the team, is  
currently making $2 million per season -- the same amount Doc Rivers 
will be getting from Orlando next season despite never having 
coached at any level. 
</P>
<P>
	Van Gundy said he wasn't exactly sure what's in his contract  
because he keeps it in a safety deposit box. 
</P>
<P>
	``The one thing about this job is, I'm fine (financially).  
Wanting to win has zero to do with money,'' Van Gundy said. ``You 
can't buy your way into something that's worthwhile, and the only 
thing worthwhile out of here is trying to be the best team for one 
year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Despite his team's postseason success, Van Gundy has not  
received a vote of confidence from Madison Square Garden 
management. 
</P>
<P>
	Garden president Dave Checketts, who demoted general manager  
Ernie Grunfeld in April because of a rift between the GM and coach, 
has steadfastly insisted that all team personnel, including the 
coach, will have their performances reviewed at the end of the 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	Checketts met with former Chicago Bulls coach Phil Jackson in  
April when the Knicks were 21-21 and in jeopardy of missing the 
playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	Checketts subsequently lied to Van Gundy by denying such a  
meeting ever took place, then met with the coach during the 
second-round series against Atlanta and apologized. 
</P>
<P>
	Speculation about whether Van Gundy would even want to return to  
the Knicks has been rampant ever since. For the past two weeks, Van 
Gundy has brushed aside all queries about his job status. 
</P>
<P>
	Van Gundy has become a risk-taker in the Eastern Conference  
finals. He tinkered with his starting lineup before Game 4 by 
inserting Latrell Sprewell and removing Kurt Thomas. And in Game 5, 
he curiously kept Marcus Camby on the bench for the first 10 
minutes of the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	``By starting Latrell, it was neither genius ... nor stupidity  
in Game 4,'' Van Gundy said. ``It was what I felt was in the best 
interest of the team. That's how I make every decision.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Van Gundy took a lot of criticism when the Sprewell move seemed  
to backfire in Game 4. But those same critics were lauding the move 
after Game 5 when Sprewell unleashed an array of offensive moves 
and had his best game of the series with 29 points. 
</P>
<P>
	With Camby, the coach decided to keep him out for the bulk of  
the third quarter because he had three fouls. He wanted Camby 
available for the entire fourth quarter, and he didn't want him 
playing tentatively because of foul trouble. 
</P>
<P>
	The move paid off.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm just really thankful that I'm a part of a team that's  
still playing,'' Van Gundy said. ``And what small part I play in 
it, I take very seriously. I do the job the best I can. '' 
</P>
<P>
	In this case, it means departing from what got the Knicks here  
and taking a gamble or two to try to help offset the loss of 
Patrick Ewing. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you become paralyzed by the thought that you may be  
criticized for doing something, you're never going to be the risk 
taker you need to be as a good coach. Risk taking is part of it. If 
it doesn't work out, you've got to accept the responsibility for it 
not working out,'' Van Gundy said.

<HEADLINE> L.A. Cops Raid Call Girl Ring </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Police say they have busted one of the most  
elaborate call girl rings since they cracked the case of the 
``Hollywood Madam,'' Heidi Fleiss, six years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Jody Diane ``Babydol'' Gibson, allegedly a former competitor of  
Fleiss, was arrested Tuesday after a 10-month investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	``Actors, producers, Fortune 500 CEOs and at least one  
professional athlete'' used Gibson's service, police Lt. Mike Felix 
said. However, police declined to identify the clients. 
</P>
<P>
	Gibson, 41, kept detailed notes on her customers and marketed  
her business on the World Wide Web as ``California Dreamin','' 
police said. Clients would pay between $500 to $3,000 for the 
services. 
</P>
<P>
	``She ran one of the largest operations since Heidi Fleiss,''  
said Detective Steve Park. ``She was very sophisticated and 
well-known throughout the U.S. and Europe.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Police arrested Gibson on Tuesday during a sting at a West Los  
Angeles hotel. Detectives served search warrants at several 
locations, including one at her Palo Verde home. 
</P>
<P>
	Gibson was booked on one count of pimping, but faces up to nine  
felony counts of pimping and pandering. Each count carries a 
sentence of up to three years. Gibson was released after posting 
$25,000 bail, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	Fleiss was arrested in 1993 and spent 20 months at a federal  
prison for conspiracy, tax evasion and laundering call-girl 
profits. Fleiss' operation also catered to a high-class clientele 
and stars, including actor Charlie Sheen, who spent $53,000 on 
Fleiss' call girls in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	Police described Gibson as a rival of Fleiss who moved to fill  
the void when Fleiss' operation closed down. Evidence indicates 
that some of Fleiss' prostitutes and clients switched to Gibson's 
business, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities found a manuscript in which Gibson detailed her life  
as a madam, Felix said. It alleged that Fleiss once asked Gibson 
for a job as an escort, police said.

<HEADLINE>  Indonesia Leader Concedes Defeat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) -- A prominent opposition leader whose  
party was behind in partial election returns conceded defeat today, 
boosting the legitimacy of a key step in Indonesia's democratic 
transition. 
</P>
<P>
	Amien Rais, a vocal critic of former authoritarian President  
Suharto, acknowledged his loss in the parliamentary election even 
though only 20 percent of the votes had been counted. 
</P>
<P>
	International election observers said Monday's poll was fair  
despite scattered irregularities, but worries have mounted that the 
delay in counting votes might rattle confidence in the process. 
</P>
<P>
	Even Rais had earlier speculated that an attempt to rig the vote  
was under way. By the end of the week, however, he was resigned to 
fifth place with 8 percent for his National Mandate Party. 
</P>
<P>
	``I accept the result wholeheartedly,'' Rais told Associated  
Press Television News. ``I don't want to make any protest because, 
as far as I know, the election was fair and free.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Early returns showed opposition leader Megawati Sukarnoputri  
with 35 percent and the ruling Golkar party with 20 percent, 
despite expectations that it would do poorly. 3/8 
</P>
<P>
	Megawati, a former legislator, is the daughter of founding  
President Sukarno. Rais, former head of Indonesia's second-largest 
Muslim group, founded his party last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Rais could still be a pivotal player if, as expected, no party  
wins a majority and negotiations on a coalition government begin. 
</P>
<P>
	He had agreed to join forces with Megawati to thwart Golkar, but  
today he left open the possibility of reluctantly making a deal 
with the ruling party. 
</P>
<P>
	``To make a coalition with Golkar is the last choice I make in  
this world,'' Rais said. 
</P>
<P>
	Golkar was an obedient political instrument during the  
three-decade rule of Suharto, who resigned a year ago amid 
pro-democracy protests and deadly riots in Jakarta and other major 
cities. Like many Indonesians, Suharto has only one name. 
</P>
<P>
	Megawati's Indonesian Democratic Party for Struggle has agreed  
to form a coalition with other opposition parties if necessary. 
</P>
<P>
	They include Rais' party and the National Awakening Party headed  
by Muslim leader Abdurrahman Wahid. It has 13 percent of the 
counted votes. 
</P>
<P>
	The official tally will be announced June 21. Overall, 48  
parties fielded candidates. 
</P>
<P>
	It was not immediately clear how many seats the vote tallies  
would translate to in Indonesia's complex system of proportional 
representation. But the top vote-getter is not necessarily 
guaranteed the most seats in Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
	The election for 462 seats in Parliament was the first step  
toward selecting a president. The new legislators and the military 
representatives, as well as 200 government appointees, will choose 
a president later this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Dozens of students protested today against the slow vote count,  
gathering outside a Jakarta hotel where results were being 
collected. They warned that Golkar might triumph again if reform 
forces splintered. 
</P>
<P>
	They also demanded a trial of Suharto, who faces a corruption  
investigation, and said the military should get out of politics. 
</P>
<P>
	The military, which says it is neutral, is guaranteed 38  
appointed seats in the new 500-member Parliament, down from 75 in 
the current legislature. Several senior Cabinet ministers are 
generals or retired generals, including military commander Gen. 
Wiranto, touted as a possible presidential candidate.

<HEADLINE> Economy Not Helping Smaller Cities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- The federal government's third annual ``State  
of Cities'' report says smaller American communities are not 
sharing in the economic boom enjoyed by mega-cities like New York 
and Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	Smaller and medium-sized cities are experiencing slower  
population growth, higher unemployment and growing poverty compared 
to larger communities, said Andrew Cuomo, secretary of the 
Department of Housing and Urban Development. 
</P>
<P>
	``A prosperity gap still divides the majority of communities  
that are doing well from the minority that are struggling,'' Cuomo 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The report was issued here in advance of the 67th annual  
Conference of Mayors. President Clinton was addressing the meeting 
via videotape today. Cuomo will address the convention Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	The report said that small cities and older, established suburbs  
right outside the cities' borders, have problems in crime and 
poverty and shouldn't allow jurisdictional boundaries hinder 
efforts to find regional solutions. 
</P>
<P>
	In the months before the report was finalized, Cuomo traveled to  
Gary, Ind., Appalachian towns in eastern Kentucky and other smaller 
communities to talk with local leaders and see why they were 
failing to share in the economic prosperity enjoyed by large 
communities. 
</P>
<P>
	For example, in Gary, 40 percent of residents fall below the  
federal poverty rate of $16,655 in annual income for a family of 
four. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our challenge now is to invest in building a brighter future  
for people and places left behind,'' Cuomo said.

<HEADLINE> Prosecutor Doubts Knight's Accuser </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BLOOMINGTON, Ind. (AP) -- Bob Knight most likely will learn  
Monday if he will face assault charges, but the prosecutor has 
questioned the credibility of the coach's accuser. 
</P>
<P>
	The Indiana coach is accused of making a racist remark in a  
restaurant near the campus Monday night, then choking a patron in 
the parking lot and challenging him to fight. 
</P>
<P>
	Monroe County prosecutor Carl Salzmann could decide to file  
assault and battery charges against the 58-year-old coach. 
</P>
<P>
	The complaint was made by Chris Foster, 38, and he faces  
possible provocation charges. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm beginning to doubt the credibility of the story,''  
Salzmann said. 
</P>
<P>
	The disturbance happened at a Mexican restaurant in  
Ellettsville. Foster said he had been listening to the conversation 
Knight was having with his family at a table across the room. 
</P>
<P>
	But Salzmann said Friday there were no thumb marks among the red  
welts on Foster's neck, which eliminates the possibility Knight 
lifted Foster off the ground. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have to have an opposable-thumb print,'' Salzmann said.  
</P>
<P>
	Investigators are now combing credit-card receipts seeking  
others who were at the restaurant at the time. They want to 
determine if Foster had been intentionally eavesdropping on the 
coach. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would mean the case leans more toward a provocation  
scenario, that this was intended to harass and annoy (Knight),'' 
Salzmann said. ``But I'm keeping an open mind.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A misdemeanor battery charge carries a maximum penalty of a  
$5,000 fine and six months in jail. A provocation charge carries a 
maximum $500 fine. 
</P>
<P>
	Knight, whose temper is notorious in college basketball, has  
been suspended or fined several times. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1979, Knight was tried and convicted in absentia and  
sentenced to six months in jail for hitting a Puerto Rican 
policeman at the Pan American Games. Indiana refused to extradite 
Knight and Puerto Rico eventually dropped attempts to get him back. 
</P>
<P>
	At the 1981 NCAA finals in Philadelphia, an LSU fan says Knight  
stuffed him in a garbage can. In 1985, he was ejected after 
throwing a chair across the court during a game against Purdue. 
</P>
<P>
	In the 1992 NCAA tournament, Knight playfully gave a mock  
whipping to Calbert Cheaney, a black player, during practice. 
Knight denied racial connotations to the prank.

<HEADLINE> Airlines Delay Passenger Rights Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Airlines hope to reach an agreement with  
Senate leaders on a plan for treating passengers better by as early 
as next week. 
</P>
<P>
	A news conference scheduled for Thursday was abruptly postponed  
after Senate leaders complained they had not signed off on the 
proposal. 
</P>
<P>
	The reversal left the chairman of United Airlines, Gerald  
Greenwald, with the chore of standing before a roomful of reporters 
and announcing that the announcement would be delayed. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the coming days we will be working to refine and improve  
our plan in conjunction with Sen. John McCain and other leading 
members of the House and Senate,'' said Greenwald, who also serves 
as chairman of the airline's trade group, the Air Transport 
Association. 
</P>
<P>
	Without taking questions, he disappeared behind the closed doors  
of the association's board room, where the nation's other top 
airline executives were waiting. 
</P>
<P>
	While the announcement triggered embarrassment among airline  
executives and chuckling on Capitol Hill, the parties agreed on a 
central point: The nation's major airlines and senators who have 
been complaining about the way they treat passengers are close to 
agreeing on a voluntary plan that would stave off congressional 
action. 
</P>
<P>
	Included in the package would be increased compensation for lost  
luggage, a promise to give passengers basic amenities when there 
are long on-board flight delays and a pledge to respond quickly to 
passenger complaints. 
</P>
<P>
	The elements are drawn from several bills proposed in the House  
and the Senate and by the Clinton administration after passenger 
complaints peaked over the New Year's holiday, when thousands of 
travelers were stranded at Midwestern airports after a snowstorm. 
</P>
<P>
	Northwest Airlines came under particularly harsh criticism for  
holding passengers for hours on one jet in Detroit despite a lack 
of food and water and an overflowing toilet. 
</P>
<P>
	Negotiations with the airlines have been led by McCain, R-Ariz.,  
chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee and co-sponsor of one of 
the passenger rights bills. Also participating have been McCain's 
co-sponsor, Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., along with Sens. Slade Gorton, 
R-Wash.; Jay Rockefeller, D-W.Va.; Ernest Hollings, D-S.C.; and 
Frank Lautenberg, D-N.J. 
</P>
<P>
	The parties had planned to hold a news conference on Capitol  
Hill to make a joint announcement, but that was scrapped Wednesday 
after airline haggling over details. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, the Air Transport Association announced that a  
consensus had been reached, and it scheduled a midday news 
conference. The timing was driven by the fact that the executives 
were in town for their quarterly meeting. When the appointed hour 
arrived, however, Greenwald announced the delay. 
</P>
<P>
	Spokesmen for several senators said support for the airline plan  
evaporated as senators read a headline in The Wall Street Journal 
saying the airlines were near an agreement with the White House. 
The headline bothered the senators because the Clinton 
administration had not been involved in the negotiations, the 
spokesmen said. 
</P>
<P>
	Several senators also said they wanted tougher language on  
several points, including policies on handling lost baggage, 
accommodating passengers who get ``bumped'' despite confirmed 
reservations and notifying the public when there are flight delays. 
</P>
<P>
	Don Marshall, a spokesman for Rockefeller, said an agreement was  
still possible despite the postponement. Several spokesman said it 
could come as early as next week. 
</P>
<P>
	``We think it's a good start, and we're continuing to work with  
the airlines to get something done here that will be in the best 
interests of passengers,'' he said.

	BERKELEY, Calif. (AP) -- Ann L. Brown, a professor whose work  
focused on how children learn and how they should be taught, died 
June 4 after a brief illness. She was 56.

<HEADLINE> Drug Testimony Admitted in Lewis Suit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- A college classmate of Reggie Lewis said in a  
deposition read in court Friday that he snorted cocaine and 
freebased with the Boston Celtics star, who died of an abnormal 
heart rhythm in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	The testimony is key to the defense of Dr. Gilbert Mudge, a  
renowned cardiologist who is accused in a $117 million malpractice 
lawsuit of misdiagnosing and mistreating Lewis. 
</P>
<P>
	He says the 27-year-old player confessed to using cocaine two  
weeks before he died and maintains that belated admission made an 
accurate diagnosis of Lewis' heart condition impossible. 
</P>
<P>
	Lewis' widow, Donna Harris-Lewis, says the claim is a low blow  
intended only to distract the jury and tarnish the name of a dead 
star. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday the judge ruled that defense attorneys may call five  
witnesses to testify about Lewis' alleged drug use. 
</P>
<P>
	Afterward, a deposition from one of them, Lewis' former  
Northeastern University classmate Wayne Brown, was read in court. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were snorting lines of cocaine and freebasing, both of us  
were smoking cocaine,'' Brown said in the deposition, adding that 
he did drugs with Lewis ``probably six'' times while they were in 
college in the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
	Harris-Lewis' attorneys have called Brown as a loser and  
attacked his credibility by citing deposition statements in which 
he discussed how he frequently used and sold drugs and drank to the 
point of blacking out. 
</P>
<P>
	Such testimony is expected to increase the rancor in the trial,  
which was dominated this week by testimony about cocaine use. 
</P>
<P>
	Mudge brought Lewis' mother and wife into the fray when he  
testified that Harris-Lewis told him months after her husband's 
death -- when the widow and the doctor were still friends -- that 
Lewis had ``died of the poisons'' his mother, a former drug abuser, 
had battled. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorneys for Harris-Lewis have contended the drug allegations  
are not only untrue, but irrelevant. Even if Lewis snorted cocaine, 
they say, it doesn't matter: Mudge's responsibility was to treat a 
heart problem, no matter what its cause. 
</P>
<P>
	Shortly before Lewis' death, Mudge came under fire when he  
offered an opinion that went against that of a ``Dream Team'' of 
doctors from New England Baptist Hospital. They had diagnosed Lewis 
with a life-threatening, potentially career-ending cardiac 
arrhythmia after his collapse during a playoff game. 
</P>
<P>
	At a news conference at the time, Mudge announced that the  
athlete's heart was healthy, saying he suffered from a neurological 
condition that causes fainting spells. Lewis, he added, could 
probably return to professional basketball. 
</P>
<P>
	Two months later, the player dropped dead of an arrhythmia, or  
abnormal heart rhythm, while practicing jump shots. 
</P>
<P>
	Drug rumors have swirled in Boston's sports and medical  
communities ever since. It also has been a sensitive topic in the 
city since 1986, when Len Bias died of a cocaine overdose days 
after he became the Celtics' first-round draft pick. 
</P>
<P>
	After a 1995 Wall Street Journal article raised the possibility  
that Lewis had used cocaine, Harris-Lewis -- who claimed Mudge had 
been a source for the story, which he has denied -- embarked on what 
she said was a quest to clear his name. 
</P>
<P>
	She sued Mudge, along with cardiology consultants Drs. Mark  
Creager and Peter Friedman. A third consultant settled before trial 
for an undisclosed amount. 
</P>
<P>
	Harris-Lewis is asking for the money Lewis could have made had  
he lived -- as much as $117 million, according to testimony from a 
sports agent.

<HEADLINE> Author Pleads Guilty in Bomb Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) -- An author has pleaded guilty to sending his  
book about Oklahoma City bombing conspiracy theories to a grand 
juror investigating the blast. 
</P>
<P>
	David Hoffman, 38, received a suspended sentence Friday after  
pleading guilty to two misdemeanor counts of tampering with the 
grand jury. He said he was trying to show the jury the truth. 
</P>
<P>
	``They've sentenced me to community service, but I think I've  
done the greatest community service a person could do,'' Hoffman 
said. ``I was trying to influence the jury to the truth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hoffman avoided jail time, receiving a one-year suspended  
sentence on each count and one year of probation. He must also 
serve 200 hours of community service. 
</P>
<P>
	Hoffman, author of ``The Oklahoma City Bombing and The Politics  
of Terror,'' is accused of sending a copy of his book and a note to 
an alternate member of the grand jury in September. 
</P>
<P>
	The grand jury met for 18 months. In its final report, it  
dismissed theories that alleged a larger conspiracy and a 
government cover-up, including theories mentioned in Hoffman's 
book. 
</P>
<P>
	The grand jury indicted Hoffman during its investigation of the  
April 19, 1995, bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building 
that killed 168 people. Timothy McVeigh and Terry Nichols were 
convicted in the blast.

<HEADLINE> House Panel Works on Social Security </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A chance remains that Congress this year will  
overhaul Social Security to enable it to withstand the retirement 
of the baby boomers. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans and Democrats on the House Ways and Means Committee  
agreed Thursday to begin working on a compromise, despite 
predictions that political pressures will be too great to fix the 
retirement program for the future. 
</P>
<P>
	Urging each lawmaker to ``examine his or her conscience and  
decide if they really want to solve this problem,'' Ways and Means 
Committee Chairman Bill Archer said the panel would hold a series 
of meetings behind closed doors ``to discuss areas of common 
ground'' and possibly prepare a draft bill for further action. 
</P>
<P>
	The Texas Republican said both political parties must put aside  
partisan considerations to ensure that Social Security remains 
solvent as the huge baby boom generation retires. The program is 
healthy now, but faces insolvency by 2034. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can prove that a democracy can address a difficult problem  
far ahead of the drop-dead date,'' Archer said. ``We can prove, 
perhaps for the first time, that we don't have to wait until we're 
at the edge of the cliff.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The panel's top Democrat, Rep. Charles Rangel of New York,  
agreed that private committee sessions would be the only way to 
``find out not how far apart we are, but how close are we?'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It would enhance the respect and support of both Democrats and  
Republicans ... if we could come together in a bipartisan way,'' 
Rangel said. 
</P>
<P>
	At the White House, press secretary Joe Lockhart said President  
Clinton commended Archer and Rangel for ``working in a constructive 
way'' on Social Security. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is a vast contrast to some of the other Republican leaders  
who have pronounced Social Security reform ... dead for the year 
for political reasons,'' Lockhart said. 
</P>
<P>
	The two sides still face long odds in reaching agreement on  
fixing Social Security, traditionally one of the most sensitive 
political issues. Clinton has proposed a plan that not all 
Democrats embrace, and GOP leaders haven't endorsed an alternative 
developed by Archer and Rep. Clay Shaw, R-Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	Multiple political considerations complicate any attempt at  
compromise, including control of the House in 2000 and Vice 
President Al Gore's campaign for president. 
</P>
<P>
	Some Democrats believe that cooperating with Republicans to fix  
Social Security only enhances the GOP in voters' eyes, while 
Republicans worry they could be hammered by Clinton and the 
Democrats if they push their own overhaul plan. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., has encouraged the  
Ways and Means Committee to move forward. And Archer met last week 
with the House Democratic leader, Rep. Dick Gephardt of Missouri, 
and assured him that Democrats would not be left out as legislation 
is developed. 
</P>
<P>
	``As long as they're not talking about dismantling the program,  
we're willing to look at ways to reach a workable solution,'' said 
Gephardt spokeswoman Laura Nichols.

<HEADLINE> Report: More minority students </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Minority enrollment in America's public  
schools is climbing, but most students still attend schools 
dominated by others of their own race and income level, a Harvard 
University report says. 
</P>
<P>
	Since 1968, enrollment of Hispanic students has increased 218  
percent, and nearly 75 percent of them attend predominantly 
minority schools, says the report by the Civil Rights Project, a 
research and advocacy organization run by the Harvard Graduate 
School of Education and Harvard Law School. 
</P>
<P>
	Enrollment of black students has risen 22 percent, and 69  
percent of them attend schools where at least half the students are 
from minority groups, says the report, titled ``Resegregation in 
American Schools.'' 
</P>
<P>
	White enrollment in public schools nationwide has declined by 16  
percent in the same 30 years, and most of those students attend 
schools that are 80 percent or more white. 
</P>
<P>
	That remains so even when white students live in generally  
nonwhite areas, said the report, which was based on a study of 
Education Department enrollment data from the late 1960s through 
the mid 1990s. At the same time, black and Hispanic students 
generally remain in black- and Hispanic-majority schools even when 
they live in the suburbs. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are clearly in a period when many policy-makers, courts,  
and opinion makers assume that desegregation is no longer 
necessary,'' an excerpt from the report says. 
</P>
<P>
	The study attributes much of the trend of minority- or  
white-dominated schools to economics and housing patterns. As for 
the trends in minority and white totals, it notes increases in 
Hispanic immigration and births and a decrease in native white 
births. 
</P>
<P>
	Schools with mostly black and Hispanic students also were 11  
times more likely to be in areas with concentrated poverty than 
their peers in predominantly white schools. Researchers say that, 
too, can be damaging because poverty is linked to lower classroom 
performance and achievement. 
</P>
<P>
	A trend toward resegregation of the races in school is  
proceeding fastest in the South, though the races are now most 
separate in schools in other regions, the report indicated. 
</P>
<P>
	Black students are most likely to go to majority black schools  
in Michigan, Illinois, New York, New Jersey and Maryland. The top 
states for Hispanic student concentration are New York, Texas, New 
Jersey, California and Illinois. 
</P>
<P>
	White children are also less likely to attend schools with  
minorities in these states. 
</P>
<P>
	In general, the researchers say, the schools with many poor  
children lack advanced courses and teachers with credentials for 
their subject areas. Such schools are more likely than others to 
have children who drop out, suffer from untreated health problems 
and forgo college. 
</P>
<P>
	Whatever the reason the nation's public schools have higher  
percentages of minority students, so-called white flight to private 
schools apparently is not a major one. In 1996, about 11 percent of 
all U.S. schoolchildren were in private schools, compared with 15 
percent in the mid-1960s and 12 percent just before the 1954 
Supreme Court decision effectively ended legally segregated 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers also note that many larger districts have won court  
permission to end previous desegregation orders. They include 
Buffalo, N.Y.; Cleveland; Mobile, Ala., and Seattle.

<HEADLINE> Huge American Flag To Be Unveiled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GASTONIA, N.C. (AP) -- Seven years after a group of veterans set  
out to express their patriotism, the fruit of their labor is about 
to be hoisted up a huge flagpole and made visible for 30 miles. 
</P>
<P>
	What has been billed as the largest flying American flag in the  
world is due to be unfurled Saturday on Crowders Mountain. 
</P>
<P>
	The flag, 65 feet tall and 114 feet wide, is the culmination of  
efforts by AMVETS Post 920, which timed the unfurling to coincide 
with Flag Day on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're trying to bring it home that the whole country needs to  
be repatriated,'' said Roy Curphey, a disabled Air Force veteran. 
``It's time to, if nothing else, stand down and look at our own 
values.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The flag is not the biggest in the country. Two flags in  
California are bigger, according to the veterans, but are not 
flown. 
</P>
<P>
	The North Carolina flag is 7,410 square feet and weighs 180  
pounds. Each stripe is 5 feet high; each star more than 4 feet 
across. 
</P>
<P>
	It's a stirring sensation when the hoist button is pushed, and  
the huge flag is slowly drawn aloft by the motorized halyard, said 
Curphey. 
</P>
<P>
	``A little flag pops in the wind,'' he said. ``And when this one  
goes up, it's not a `pop, snap.' ... It's just unreal the noise it 
makes. It just talks to you -- it's awesome. It sounds like the 
whole place is making noise.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The veterans have traveled the country raising money for the  
project. The money for the project was raised $5 and $10 at a time, 
mostly through donations from schoolchildren and other folk. 
</P>
<P>
	``Actually, the way we feel, it belongs to the people,'' said  
Jim Varian, an Army veteran and a Post 920 trustee. 
</P>
<P>
	Retired Army Maj. Gen. Patrick Brady, a Medal of Honor recipient  
and president of the Citizen's Flag Alliance, was expected to 
attend the ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is the most important symbol we have, and unique among all  
the symbols of the world,'' he said. ``There's only one flag that's 
designed and dedicated to freedom and justice, and that's the 
American flag.''

<HEADLINE>  Lobo To Miss Rest of WNBA Season </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Her season lasted all of 42 seconds. Now Rebecca  
Lobo, one of the WNBA's marquee players, is the season's first 
major casualty. 
</P>
<P>
	The New York Liberty star will miss the remainder of the season  
because of a torn knee ligament that will require surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm terribly disappointed that this happened,'' Lobo said  
Friday at Beth Israel Hospital, where she was undergoing therapy. 
``But I'm upbeat because I'm in great care. 
</P>
<P>
	``I will be on the sidelines during the season cheering on my  
teammates. I will be back next season.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lobo tore the anterior cruciate ligament in her left knee in the  
first minute of the team's season opener Thursday night. Team 
physician Dr. Susan Craig-Scott said Lobo will have surgery in two 
to three weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Craig-Scott said Lobo's rehabilitation will take a minimum of  
six months. 
</P>
<P>
	``She should be ready next season,'' Craig-Scott said. ``We  
expect her to be back. She's a tough kid.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lobo, who was in tears Thursday night, especially when talking  
to her mother at the hospital and when speaking with her father by 
telephone, was more upbeat Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope my New Year's Eve present will be that I will be back  
on the court,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	``She was very upset when the injury first occurred, but she  
calmed down in the locker room.'' Craig-Scott said. ``She was in 
good spirits this morning.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Before this season, the former Connecticut All-American said her  
worst injury required arthroscopic knee surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	``I never felt anything like this before,'' she said. ``It's the  
first injury that's taken me out of commission for this long a 
time. It's the first time I've had something of this magnitude.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lobo, who has started all 59 Liberty games, was hurt during New  
York's 87-60 victory over Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a huge loss to our team,'' general manager Carol  
Blazejowski said. ``You don't replace a player of Rebecca's caliber 
overnight.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Added Teresa Weatherspoon: ``It's an awful feeling to know what  
Rebecca is going through. ... We will definitely pick it up for 
Rebecca.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On the second possession, Lobo grabbed a rebound after Kym  
Hampton's missed shot, pivoted and fell. She clutched her leg for 
about 30 seconds as play continued before an official called an 
injury timeout. 
</P>
<P>
	``I went in, got a sweet offensive rebound,'' Lobo said. ``And  
when I came down, I thought somebody hit me on the side of the knee 
and it just buckled. ... But people who watched video of the play 
said nobody hit me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lobo, the Liberty's leading rebounder each of the past two  
seasons, with 7.3 and 6.9 per game, respectively, was helped off 
the floor by Hampton and Sue Wicks. 
</P>
<P>
	``She was crying,'' Wicks said. ``I didn't even ask her how she  
was, she just shook her head. She knew immediately that it was bad. 
</P>
<P>
	``Rebecca's so tough that she wouldn't stay on the ground with a  
twisted ankle or something small. I've never seen her cry, so you 
know it's bad. You can try, but there's no way to prevent that if 
it's going to happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Liberty coach Richie Adubato, making his Liberty debut, was  
heartbroken. 
</P>
<P>
	``Rebecca is an integral part of both our team's offense and  
defense,'' he said. ``Losing her for the rest of the season is 
difficult. She was having a great training camp and playing very 
well. ... It now means that her teammates are going to have to step 
up. 
</P>
<P>
	``The last four or five days, she was rebounding, knocking down  
jump shots, catching the ball in the low post and making her 
move.'' 
</P>

	Wicks will now see additional minutes, as will rookies Tamika  
Whitmore and Michele VanGorp.

<HEADLINE>  Lobo To Miss Rest of WNBA Season </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Her season lasted all of 42 seconds. Now Rebecca  
Lobo, one of the WNBA's marquee players, is the season's first 
major casualty. 
</P>
<P>
	The New York Liberty star will miss the remainder of the season  
because of a torn knee ligament that will require surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm terribly disappointed that this happened,'' Lobo said  
Friday at Beth Israel Hospital, where she was undergoing therapy. 
``But I'm upbeat because I'm in great care. 
</P>
<P>
	``I will be on the sidelines during the season cheering on my  
teammates. I will be back next season.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lobo tore the anterior cruciate ligament in her left knee in the  
first minute of the team's season opener Thursday night. Team 
physician Dr. Susan Craig-Scott said Lobo will have surgery in two 
to three weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Craig-Scott said Lobo's rehabilitation will take a minimum of  
six months. 
</P>
<P>
	``She should be ready next season,'' Craig-Scott said. ``We  
expect her to be back. She's a tough kid.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lobo, who was in tears Thursday night, especially when talking  
to her mother at the hospital and when speaking with her father by 
telephone, was more upbeat Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope my New Year's Eve present will be that I will be back  
on the court,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	``She was very upset when the injury first occurred, but she  
calmed down in the locker room.'' Craig-Scott said. ``She was in 
good spirits this morning.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Before this season, the former Connecticut All-American said her  
worst injury required arthroscopic knee surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	``I never felt anything like this before,'' she said. ``It's the  
first injury that's taken me out of commission for this long a 
time. It's the first time I've had something of this magnitude.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lobo, who has started all 59 Liberty games, was hurt during New  
York's 87-60 victory over Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a huge loss to our team,'' general manager Carol

<HEADLINE> FBI Probes Computer E-Mail Bug </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The FBI on Friday tried to track the author of a  
file-destroying computer virus that has hit some of the nation's 
biggest corporations and infected tens of thousands of machines. 
</P>
<P>
	Software companies posted new virus-killing programs on their  
Web sites to attack the Worm.Explore.Zip virus, which enters 
machines in almost the same way as the recent Melissa virus -- by 
disguising itself as a friendly piece of e-mail. 
</P>
<P>
	Melissa infected hundreds of thousands of computers, but there  
were signs Friday that the new virus may not be spreading as 
quickly. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, it hit systems at leading technology companies such as  
Compaq Computer and Motorola and other major companies, including 
AT&AMP;T, Boeing and General Electric. 
</P>
<P>
	The FBI would not reveal the methods of its investigation or  
provide a more specific estimate of how many computers were 
infected. 
</P>
<P>
	``This program is deleting files, and for people who did not  
have back-ups, they could be lost for good,'' said Mark Zajicek, 
member of the Computer Emergency Response Team at Carnegie Mellon 
University in Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
	First detected in Israel early this week, Worm.Explore.Zip  
masquerades as a message from a friend or acquaintance: ``Hi 
(Recipient Name)! I received your e-mail and I shall send you a 
reply ASAP. Till then, take a look at the attached zipped docs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The message is harmless unless the recipient opens an attached  
file. That unleashes a program that can wipe out the contents of 
documents, spreadsheets, graphic presentations and other important 
files created by Microsoft programs. 
</P>
<P>
	It also contaminates a computer's e-mail program and sends a  
copy of itself as a reply to any incoming e-mail. That is 
particularly threatening for companies where workers regularly zip 
e-mails back and forth. 
</P>
<P>
	``Once the virus has started within an organization, it embeds  
itself into the system,'' said Jan Kaminski, president of FastLane 
Technologies, a Canadian software company. ``There's nothing you 
can do until you actually remove some files from the machine.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But, thanks to the run-ins with the Melissa and Chernobyl  
viruses earlier this spring, computer systems managers reacted more 
quickly when word of Worm.Explore.Zip began to spread. 
</P>
<P>
	``We continue to get direct reports, but they're not increasing  
at the rate it might have, so we're encouraged by that,'' said 
Zajicek. 
</P>
<P>
	Zajicek warned, however, that computer users still need to be  
cautious about any e-mail with an attachment. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's too early to tell how far it's already spread and  
difficult to tell how far it will spread in the coming days and 
weeks,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The FBI issued a warning on its Web site.  
</P>
<P>
	``Users should exercise caution when reading their e-mail for  
the next few days and bring unusual messages to the attention of 
their system administrator,'' said Michael A. Vatis, director of 
the FBI's National Infrastructure Protection Center. ``The 
transmission of a virus can be a criminal matter, and the FBI is 
investigating.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Worm.Explore.Zip is the third major bug to sweep across the  
Internet since late March, when the Melissa virus overwhelmed 
systems with floods of e-mail. A more damaging virus named 
Chernobyl struck in late April, but did most of its harm overseas. 
</P>
<P>
	The new bug is only known to attack computers using Microsoft  
operating systems Windows 95, Windows 98, and Windows NT. Rival 
operating systems such as Macintosh and Unix apparently are not 
vulnerable. 
</P>
<P>
	Early warnings helped AT&AMP;T, Compaq and GE contain the damage  
Thursday when their computer systems were infected, while Microsoft 
said it shut down its corporate e-mail system for two hours as a 
precaution. 
</P>
<P>
	At Boeing, the company shut down an e-mail system that links  
160,000 computers. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're hopeful we got things shut down fast enough so it will  
minimize the loss of any documents,'' said spokesman Dave Suffia. 
</P>
<P>
	At Lucent Technologies, which makes telecommunications  
equipment, strange messages began appearing on computers on 
Thursday morning, said spokesman John Skalko, who inadvertently 
activated Worm.Explore.Zip on his computer. 
</P>
<P>
	``That was enough. I lost all my (Microsoft Word) files,'' said  
Skalko, estimating that 150 documents were destroyed. At least 20 
to 30 other computers were stricken by the virus before Lucent 
technicians shut down the e-mail system and inoculated it. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we nipped it in the bud,'' said Skalko.  
</P>
<P>
	Because of the way it works, Worm.Explore.Zip actually does not  
fit the technical definition of a computer virus. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, software experts said, the bug should be classified as  
a ``Trojan Horse'' -- a name borrowed from an ancient battle in 
which Greek soldiers hid inside a wooden horse to launch a surprise 
attack on the city of Troy.

<HEADLINE> NL Suspends Mets' Valentine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Now that the National League has seen through  
his disguise, Bobby Valentine admits he was the mysterious man in 
the mustache but says he never went back to his team's dugout. 
</P>
<P>
	The New York Mets manager was suspended for two games and fined  
$5,000 Friday by the NL for returning to the dugout in a disguise 
after being ejected Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``The picture looked like I was in the dugout, but they got it  
all wrong,'' Valentine said before showing reporters the spot 
between the runway and the dugout, where he stood with a fake 
mustache and glasses for the last two innings of Wednesday night's 
game against Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
	``I absolutely was never in the dugout,'' Valentine insisted.  
</P>
<P>
	Valentine was ejected in the 12th inning by plate umpire Randy  
Marsh for arguing a catcher's interference call on Mike Piazza. 
</P>
<P>
	Valentine said he then went into the trainers' room and came out  
with eye black on his upper lip. He showed it to a couple of his 
pitchers in the clubhouse who laughed and then gave him sunglasses 
and a hat. 
</P>
<P>
	He quickly was spotted in the dugout by a television camera.  
</P>
<P>
	``I wasn't fooling anyone with that disguise,'' he said. ``If  
Randy Marsh saw it, I believe he would have laughed. This had 
absolutely nothing to do with the umpires. I did it to lighten up 
the team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	NL president Len Coleman apparently didn't chuckle. He cited  
league rule 5.1, which says: ``When a manager, player, coach or 
trainer is put out of a game by an umpire, he shall leave the field 
immediately.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The rule goes on to say ejected personnel ``shall remain in the  
clubhouse until the game is ended or change to street clothes and 
either leave the park or take a seat in the grandstand well removed 
from the vicinity of his club's bullpen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I understand now that I wasn't supposed to be here,''  
Valentine said, standing one step away from the dugout. ``I had 
never read the rule before today. Now I know I need to be in the 
clubhouse. Every manager I've ever seen ejected has been standing 
in the runway.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Yankees manager Joe Torre, no stranger to turmoil, shook his  
head when asked about Valentine's penalty. 
</P>
<P>
	``See what happens when you manage in New York,'' Torre said in  
Miami. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was laughing. The disguise, it was comical to look at it,''  
Chicago Cubs manager Jim Riggleman said. ``Bobby's something. He's 
a character. He's a brilliant baseball man, extremely intelligent. 
I think Bobby was having some fun with it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The suspension was to start Saturday but Valentine appealed,  
meaning it will not begin until after a hearing before Coleman. The 
appeal likely will be heard next week in Cincinnati. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're just going to discuss it,'' Valentine said. ``I don't  
think anything is going to change.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nothing appears to have changed, either, in the conflict between  
Valentine and Bobby Bonilla. After being told on Monday that he 
would not start for six days, the slumping Bonilla refused to pinch 
hit Tuesday. Valentine then refused to use him the next night. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't need to be compatible with the manager,'' said  
Bonilla, who was available to play Friday. ``I need to do my job. 
He's the guy in charge and I will do whatever he asks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bonilla claimed he learned about his benching from the  
newspapers as well as Valentine. The manager insists he told the 
player one day before it was reported in newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I called him in my office Monday and told him other guys would  
play the outfield this week,'' Valentine said. ``There is no doubt 
in my mind that I told him, and there should be no doubt in his 
mind.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bonilla, who is owed $9,575,411 through the 2000 season, is  
hitting .167 in 90 at-bats. He says he's not bothered by the 
situation and wants to stay with the Mets, even though they would 
like to dump him. 
</P>
<P>
	General manager Steve Phillips reportedly put him on waivers  
last week and said he is exploring trades. Bonilla's salary and 
inability to play the field make him unattractive to most teams. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm confident Steve Phillips will be able to work out some  
sort of deal to the satisfaction of the Mets and Bobby Bonilla,'' 
said Jeff Borris, one of the outfielder's agents. ``I know they're 
trying to put something together.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Phillips said he has the authority from ownership to release  
Bonilla, but that remains ``a last resort.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It has been disruptive and we need to settle it down soon,''  
Phillips said. ``It's not a situation where the two of them need to 
go out for dinner. But they have to get along within the framework 
of the team to help us win. 
</P>
<P>
 *Notes:* The Mets activated RHP Greg McMichael and optioned INF  
Melvin Mora to Triple-A Norfolk. McMichael has missed the entire 
season with a sore shoulder. He gives Valentine 12 pitchers on the 
roster.

<HEADLINE> Knicks Advance Without Johnson </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- On Friday night, the big L stood for longshot,  
which was the only way to look at how the New York Knicks advanced 
into the NBA Finals after Larry Johnson went down with a knee 
injury. 
</P>
<P>
	Already undermanned with the loss of center Patrick Ewing, the  
Knicks shrugged off Johnson's second-period knee injury to overcome 
the Indiana Pacers 90-82 in Game 6 of the Eastern Conference 
Finals. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson, whose `Big L' arm sign has become his trademark after  
baskets, missed the celebration. He was in the hospital with 
strained right knee ligaments after Travis Best rolled into him 
midway through the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	The collision left Johnson screaming in pain, clutching his knee  
and, some might have thought, taking the Knicks' chances down with 
him. 
</P>
<P>
	It didn't turn out that way.  
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously, Larry's a great player and emotionally it takes a  
toll on your team,'' Knicks coach Jeff Van Gundy said. ``Our guys 
fought. We had to just hang around. Somehow we did.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That was the formula throughout the series and it worked again.  
At one point, Chris Childs made a third-quarter basket and formed 
the L with his arms, a reminder that the Knicks had Johnson on 
their mind. 
</P>
<P>
	Allan Houston, who started the game missing four of five shots,  
hit 11 of his next 12 to lead all scorers with 32 points. Marcus 
Camby, who blossomed in the Indiana series, picked up much of 
Johnson's playing time and had 15. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just wanted to keep doing what I was doing after Larry went  
down,'' Houston said. ``I didn't want to put more pressure on 
myself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Allan was huge,'' Van Gundy said. ``The will and the work and  
commitment they had, I feel good for those guys. It got to the 
point where all they cared about was winning. It's hard to get to 
but we got to it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The loss of Johnson seemed to be no big deal to the Knicks, who  
adjusted on the fly. Camby and Kurt Thomas picked up his playing 
time and, as they have throughout the playoffs, the Knicks found a 
way to win. 
</P>
<P>
	When Johnson went down, he remained on the floor for several  
minutes. He was immediately surrounded by teammates and helped off 
by Herb Williams and Chris Dudley, led into the locker room by Dr. 
Norman Scott, the team physician. 
</P>
<P>
	X-rays were negative and the preliminary diagnosis was sprained  
ligaments. Johnson was taken to a hospital for a precautionary MRI 
examination. He will be re-evaluated on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Knicks' front line is already shorthanded after Ewing  
suffered a partial tear in his left Achilles, ending his season 
after two games of the Eastern Conference finals. Ewing led cheers 
from the bench as his team closed in on the victory. 
</P>
<P>
	``Practice should be interesting,'' Van Gundy said, thinking  
about the injuries. ``I'm going to get some (playing) time in 
practice. So that will be good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson was a vital cog in the Knicks' attack. His four-point  
play -- a 3-point field goal followed by a free throw -- with 5.7 
seconds left provided the deciding points in the Knicks' 92-91 
victory in Game 3. 
</P>
<P>
	In Game 5, Johnson hit consecutive 3-pointers down the stretch  
as New York pulled away for a 101-94 victory that put it in 
position to close out the Pacers at home. 
</P>
<P>
	When he was injured, Johnson had just scored two baskets after  
an 0-for-3 first quarter. He left the game having scored eight 
points in 14 minutes.

<HEADLINE> Workplaces Improve Safety Record </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Safety rules adopted after a series of disasters  
in the early 1900s have contributed to a more than 90 percent drop 
in the rate of workers killed on the job, federal health officials 
say. 
</P>
<P>
	The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Thursday  
that work-related deaths declined from 61 per 100,000 workers in 
1913 to four per 100,000 in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	``There absolutely has been a substantial decline in deaths in  
the workplace this century, although you're still not risk-free and 
there's still a lot of work to be done,'' said Nancy Stout of the 
CDC's National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health. 
</P>
<P>
	An estimated 23,000 people died from work-related injuries in  
1913 compared with 5,100 in 1997, according to the National Safety 
Council and the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. During this same 
period, the work force grew from 38 million to about 130 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the largest declines have been in high-risk industries  
such as mining, where the average death rate was 329 per 100,000 
from 1911 to 1915, compared with 25 per 100,000 in 1996-97, the CDC 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Workers now realize they don't have to accept the risk of  
injury as part of a job,'' Ms. Stout said. 
</P>
<P>
	Among steelworkers, there were 17 deaths nationwide in 1997  
compared with 195 in 1906 and 1907 in one Pennsylvania county 
alone. 
</P>
<P>
	It took calamities like the 1907 coal mine explosion in  
Monongah, W.Va., that killed at least 360 people to help pave the 
way for workplace safety laws. The explosion led to passage in 1910 
of the Organic Act, which established the U.S. Bureau of Mines. 
</P>
<P>
	A 1911 New York City garment factory fire claimed 146 lives,  
mostly young women, because there were no alarms or sprinklers and 
the exits were inadequate. The fire led to some of the nation's 
most stringent workplace safety laws. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, industries with the highest rates for fatal workplace  
accidents include mining, agriculture/forestry/fishing and 
construction. 
</P>
<P>
	The leading causes of workplace deaths involve motor vehicles,  
homicides and machine-related injuries.

<HEADLINE> 'System Failed' in Wash. Abuse Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MARYSVILLE, Wash. (AP) -- Hardly anyone had seen or talked to  
Linda David for several years, but her husband, Victor, was still 
cashing her disability checks, so social workers were sent to look 
in on her. 
</P>
<P>
	What they found was so shocking that 2 1/2 years later, Washington  
officials are still scrambling to explain what went wrong. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. David, 50, was discovered crammed into the bow of her  
husband's putrid, scum-stained sailboat. She was covered in vomit 
and lay amid dog feces from six German shepherds that also lived on 
the 30-foot vessel. 
</P>
<P>
	Her nose was distorted and bulbous, her ears were cauliflowered,  
her face was covered with knots and bruises. Doctors said her limbs 
were deformed by years of untreated fractures. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. David was rescued from the boat in 1997 by police in  
Everett, about 25 miles north of Seattle. But it wasn't until last 
month that prosecutors charged her husband -- whom the state had 
been paying to serve as her caregiver -- with a crime. 
</P>
<P>
	Even worse, state records reveal that a doctor suspected Mrs.  
David was being badly abused as early as 1983, and that he urged 
welfare workers to investigate. 
</P>
<P>
	``The system failed. People failed. Officials failed,'' said  
Gov. Gary Locke, who has ordered tighter scrutiny of welfare cases, 
particularly those involving elderly or disabled people being cared 
for by others. 
</P>
<P>
	``All of us have to be wondering: How could the system -- state  
social workers, investigators, local police, attorneys -- have let 
Linda David down so miserably?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Victor David, 59, was charged last month with assault and could  
get up to 10 years in prison. He was referred this week to a state 
mental hospital to determine if he is competent to stand trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors filed the charges two days after The Seattle Times  
published a story detailing how Mrs. David was kept prisoner for 
years, why state workers neglected to help and why it took so long 
for her husband to be charged. 
</P>
<P>
	David has denied abusing his wife, saying she suffered from  
multiple sclerosis and was injured falling out of a truck. 
</P>
<P>
	But her relatives believe she was abused even before the couple  
married in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
	And in a 1983 report -- the one that enabled David to get up to  
$450 a month in state money to care for Mrs. David -- a physician 
put a question mark next to the diagnosis of multiple sclerosis and 
suggested that she may have suffered brain damage from ``long-term 
and severe abuse.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The doctor noted that David was ``intermittently paranoid and  
possibly hostile'' and urged ``immediate investigation into home 
situation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	State welfare caseworkers said that they tried to help but that  
Mrs. David told them she was OK. On other occasions, they said, 
they were intimidated by her husband, who would wave a gun and use 
the dogs to scare visitors. 
</P>
<P>
	Lyle Quasim, chief of Washington's welfare system, defended his  
social workers. ``I haven't found anything that we have done 
incorrectly,'' he said last week. 
</P>
<P>
	Bill Wegeleben, special assistant to Quasim, said the state  
didn't know for certain whether Mrs. David has MS, and still 
doesn't know, but that doesn't matter. He said she was eligible for 
disability payments because she was found to have ``functional 
impairment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	David moved his boat from marina to marina in the Puget Sound  
area over the years. He occasionally worked as a truck driver and 
would leave the boat and turn off the power for days at a time, 
according to neighbors who lived aboard boats nearby. 
</P>
<P>
	``No way I could get off to get help,'' Mrs. David told the  
Times. ``That was home. I never had anywhere else.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Neighboring boaters wondered about David, whom they described as  
ill-tempered. Some doubted he even had a wife, since no one ever 
saw her. 
</P>
<P>
	Finally, in January 1997, a welfare agent who hadn't heard from  
Mrs. David in at least three years went to the boat to check on her 
and then called police. The boat smelled so bad, officers had to 
wear masks. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. David now lives in a nursing home. The Times reported that  
she can barely raise an arm and that her face still bears the 
evidence of what she described as ``very, very hard'' beatings by 
her husband. 
</P>
<P>
	But until last month, David remained free.  
</P>
<P>
	Everett police concluded they had no case, mainly because there  
were no witnesses to the abuse. The state attorney general's 
Medicaid fraud unit held the case for almost a year and a half 
before sending it on to the Snohomish County prosecutor's office, 
which filed the assault charge nine months later. 
</P>
<P>
	Even now, prosecutors say the case won't be simple to prove.  
It's unclear whether Mrs. David will be considered mentally fit to 
testify. 
</P>
<P>
	``Contrary to what you hear on the radio and everything, this is  
not an easy case,'' said Jim Townsend, the county's chief criminal 
deputy prosecutor. ``It produces a strong emotional reaction. But 
you've still got to prove it in court.''

<HEADLINE> NYC's Safir May Pay for Oscar Trip </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Police Commissioner Howard Safir has tentatively  
agreed to reimburse a Revlon executive $7,000 for an 
all-expenses-paid trip to the Academy Awards, the Daily News 
reported Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	A city investigation cleared Safir of any wrongdoing but  
recommended that he repay the money to avoid any hint of 
impropriety, the newspaper said, citing an unidentified source. 
</P>
<P>
	Safir came under fire after he and his wife flew to Los Angeles  
for the Oscars on March 21 aboard a corporate jet chartered by 
Revlon president and chief executive George Fellows. 
</P>
<P>
	Mayor Rudolph Giuliani defended Safir, and the commissioner said  
he did not believe he broke any rules because Revlon does not do 
business with the city. 
</P>
<P>
	The trip came under more scrutiny after Safir initially said  
that because of a ``scheduling conflict,'' he would miss a City 
Council hearing about the police street-crime unit that killed an 
unarmed West African immigrant in a hail of 41 bullets. 
</P>
<P>
	After being spotted on TV walking down the red carpet at the  
Oscars ceremony -- near actress Helen Hunt -- Safir took a red-eye 
flight back to New York and testified at the hearing. 
</P>
<P>
	Safir's spokeswoman, Marilyn Mode, had no comment Friday on  
whether he would reimburse Fellows.

<HEADLINE> Amish Teens Begin Drinking Routine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HAZLETON, Iowa (AP) -- Every Sunday here in Amish country,  
bearded men, up at dawn, load their horse-drawn buckboards with 
benches for worship services. The women, wearing dark, ankle-length 
dresses and white bonnets, pack the food and other items for the 
day's big meal. 
</P>
<P>
	As for the Amish teen-agers, many of them have their own ritual,  
too. 
</P>
<P>
	They drink.  
</P>
<P>
	``Sunday night is a party night for them,'' Sheriff Leonard  
Davis said. ``It's pretty much beer and whiskey -- a liquid diet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When calls come in on Friday and Saturday nights about underage  
drinking in this part of Iowa, Davis and his deputies find that the 
incidents almost always involve non-Amish, or ``Englishers,'' as 
the Amish call them. 
</P>
<P>
	When the calls come in on Sundays, however, deputies know they  
will probably be busting up beer bashes involving children of Old 
Order Amish families who have no electricity, motor vehicles or 
other modern conveniences. The locals call them ``hook-and-eye 
Dutch,'' because they won't use buttons or zippers to fasten their 
clothing, only little metal hooks. 
</P>
<P>
	Hazleton, population 700, is home to about 400 Amish, whos trim  
farmsteads, located on a maze of narrow gravel roads, dot the lush, 
gently rolling landscape blessed with rich, black soil. A total of 
about 150,000 Amish live in 22 states and Canada. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hazleton is known, at least among the Amish, as being the most  
strict community in the state,'' said Linda Egenes, a journalism 
instructor at Maharishi University in Fairfield who has completed a 
book on Amish family life in Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
	That made it even more of a jolt to the community when on March  
14, up to 40 Amish teens went on a rampage against one of their 
own. 
</P>
<P>
	Just after midnight that Sunday, Amish teens vandalized Roman  
Raber's farmstead. As his family huddled in fear inside, vandals 
broke 44 windows, destroyed three doors, overturned two buggies and 
damaged curtains, antiques, a lamp and mirrors. 
</P>
<P>
	Numerous alcohol-related citations were issued and deputies  
charged four Amish teen-agers with criminal mischief. They pleaded 
guilty and were sentenced to 90 days in jail. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Egenes said that, generally, ``young Amish people are  
allowed to flirt with worldly ways, somewhat, and within reason'' 
during their late teens when they are allowed to drive a horse and 
buggy. The wordly ways might involve dancing, drinking and dating. 
</P>
<P>
	``In Pennsylvania German, the Amish call it `Rum Springa,' which  
literally means `running around,''' she said. ``But what happened 
in Hazleton, I would say this definitely presents a problem. It 
would be considered to be way out of line.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Hazleton, Amish parents worry about the drinking among their  
children. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's been some of it before. You talk to them, you  
definitely do. Everyone's got problems. If you don't work on your 
problems ...,'' Eli Raber said from his front porch before 
shrugging and going back inside. He would not say whether he was 
related to Roman Raber. 
</P>
<P>
	Rudy Gingerich, 76, joining other Amish men and women for lunch  
at the Prairie Grove Public School, said the episode was an 
embarrassment for the community. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is kind of getting out of hand,'' he said, clutching a  
fistful of forks while making his way to the school. ``I don't know 
why it is happening. I can't tell you. The kids kind of got a mind 
of their own.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Maurice ``Tex'' Pentecost, 64, who has befriended dozens of  
Amish teens in the Hazleton area over the years, said they 
generally are ``good kids.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I put up 627 bales of hay last week and a bunch of them came  
over to help and didn't charge me nothing,'' Pentecost said. 
``Drinking up here has been going on for years. These kids' parents 
and grandparents did it. They didn't raise hell like this bunch, 
but it's nothing new. These kids, they're very regretful of what 
they did.'' 
</P>
<P>
	CoeAnn Cornish, who is not Amish but lives with her husband,  
Mark, in the midst of Hazleton's Amish settlement, said that a few 
weeks ago, a group of Amish teens who had been drinking pulled up 
in their yard and started yelling and ``being a nuisance.'' They 
knocked over a kerosene barrel before her husband chased them off. 
</P>
<P>
	``For the most part, they're good kids. I wouldn't trade my  
neighbors for anybody,'' Ms. Cornish said. ``But this drinking and 
vandalism is bringing a lot of tension around here.''

<HEADLINE> Golfer Duval Burns Thumb on Teapot  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JACKSONVILLE, Fla. (AP) -- David Duval managed to avoid injury  
while snowboarding on the slopes of Idaho during the winter. The 
real danger came Friday morning from a tea pot on the gas stove in 
his new house. 
</P>
<P>
	Duval, the No. 1 player in the world and one of the favorites  
heading into the U.S. Open, sustained second-degree burns on his 
right thumb and forefinger picking up a tea pot. 
</P>
<P>
	Bev Norwood, a spokesman for Duval at International Management  
Group, said Duval is expected to play the U.S. Open, which starts 
Thursday at Pinehurst No. 2 in North Carolina, although he may not 
practice again until Monday or Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Duval could not be reached for comment.  
</P>
<P>
	The injury occurred after Duval moved into his new house in  
Ponte Vedra Beach on Monday. Norwood said the gas stove made the 
tea pot handle hotter than the electric stove in his previous 
house, and that Duval didn't realize it until he picked up the pot. 
</P>
<P>
	A four-time winner on the PGA Tour this year who already has  
earned more than $2.8 million, Duval replaced Tiger Woods as No. 1 
in the world rankings with his victory in The Players Championship. 
He also won the Bob Hope Classic with the only final-round 59 in 
PGA history. 
</P>
<P>
	Duval was the favorite going into the Masters and was making a  
strong move in the final round until a double bogey on No. 11. He 
wound up tied for sixth, five strokes back of Jose Maria Olazabal. 
</P>
<P>
	He missed the cut for the first time in 15 events in New  
Orleans, took three weeks off and then finished in a tie for third 
in the Memorial Tournament last week.

<HEADLINE> Stocks Fall; Dow Down 163.37 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks fell sharply today after a tame inflation  
report failed to temper concerns that the Federal Reserve will 
raise interest rates to slow down the robust U.S. economy. 
</P>
<P>
	At 3 p.m. on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was  
down 163.37 at 10,457.90. The blue-chip index rose almost 70 points 
in early trading before retreating. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators also widened their losses. The Nasdaq  
composite index, which has been battered in recent weeks amid a 
selloff in technology shares, was down 36.97 at 2,447.65, and the 
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was down 13.99 at 1,288.83. 
</P>
<P>
	Stocks initially rose as investors cheered only a slight gain in  
the Producer Price Index last month. The index, which measures 
inflation before it reaches the consumer, rose just 0.2 percent in 
May, down sharply from the 0.5 percent advance in April. 
</P>
<P>
	The inflation report gave investors some reassurance that the  
Fed might not feel the need to raise interest rates at its next 
policy-making meeting, scheduled for June 29 and 30, to prevent the 
economy from overheating and driving inflation higher. Higher rates 
would raise corporate borrowing costs and eat into profits. 
</P>
<P>
	But the advance on Wall Street stalled out as robust growth in  
other economic reports released today renewed concerns about a rate 
hike. Traders said rumors were circulating that the Fed may even 
convene a special, early meeting to debate a rate increase. 
</P>
<P>
	The speculation was fueled after the Commerce Department  
reported that retail sales -- which represent about a third of the 
nation's economic output -- rose 1 percent in May, extending a long 
string of gains. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, the University of Michigan's consumer sentiment  
index rose to better-than-expected levels, showing that Americans 
remain upbeat thanks to the strong U.S. economy. 
</P>
<P>
	``The market is very confused today,'' said Alfred E. Goldman,  
director of market analysis at A.G. Edwards &AMP; Sons Inc. in St. 
Louis. ``It liked the PPI number, but didn't like the retail sales 
or the Michigan survey.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Internet shares were mostly lower. CMGI fell 10 9/16 to 90 15/16  
after the Internet holding company announced higher-than-expected 
third-quarter losses. 
</P>
<P>
	EBay, an online auctioneer, plunged 15 5/16 to 167 3/8 after its  
system crashed, forcing it to halt operations. 
</P>
<P>
	Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 7-to-5 margin on the  
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 564.92 million 
shares, up from 556.00 million shares on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index was down 4.91 at 617.94, and the  
American Stock Exchange composite index was down 2.76 at 765.49.

<HEADLINE> Saga Urges OK of Takeover Offer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OSLO, Norway (AP) -- Saga Petroleum ASA on Friday advised its  
shareholders to accept a takeover offer from the Norwegian state 
oil company Statoil and Norsk Hydro ASA after the companies outbid 
France's Elf Aquitaine. 
</P>
<P>
	Statoil and 51-percent state-owned Norsk Hydro bid 135 kroner  
($17.69) per share in stocks and cash for their smaller rival, 10 
kroner ($1.28) more than Elf's bid. The joint bid values Saga at 
about 20 billion kroner ($2.65 billion). Elf said its own bid for 
Saga stands. 
</P>
<P>
	After a four-hour meeting Friday, a majority of Saga Petroleum's  
board recommended the Norwegian bid even though it means breaking 
up Norway's third largest oil company. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am not satisfied with the solution overall, but I think it  
is a good solution for the stockholders,'' said Saga's managing 
director Diderik Schnitler. ``It is not a good solution for 
continuing the organization.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a separate news release, labor unions at Saga expressed deep  
disappointment over the vote and said Saga employees would stage a 
two-hour protest strike on June 17. 
</P>
<P>
	The Norsk Hydro-Statoil bid is contingent on acceptance by 70  
percent of Saga's shareholders by June 18, endorsement by Norsk 
Hydro's owners and government approval. 
</P>
<P>
	Saga Petroleum, which employs about 1,500 people, was founded in  
1972 as a privately owned alternate to the country's two 
state-controlled oil companies. However, it reported losses last 
year and was planning severe cutbacks. 
</P>
<P>
	In the 1970s, Saga benefited from a government policy giving the  
three Norwegian companies preferential treatment when oil licenses 
were awarded for sectors off the country's coast. Saga now controls 
petroleum reserves of roughly 1.5 billion barrels of oil 
equivalents. 
</P>
<P>
	On May 10, Norsk Hydro offered to trade one of its own shares  
for three Saga shares. It also made a deal with Statoil, Saga's 
largest shareholder with 19.4 percent, to split Saga's assets so 
that Statoil will end up with 25 percent and Norsk Hydro the rest. 
They upped their offer after Elf bid.

<HEADLINE> Senators List Financial Assets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Senate has its share of multimillionaires  
with such familiar names as Rockefeller and Kennedy, but its 
leaders are far less wealthy, according to financial disclosure 
forms released Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The forms also disclose other nuggets, for example Hall of Famer  
Jim Bunning's baseball card-signing income and the value of 
96-year-old Strom Thurmond's South Carolina burial plots. 
</P>
<P>
	Most Americans would consider all members of Congress well off.  
Their rank-and-file salary is $136,700, with floor leaders earning 
$151,800. Over in the House the speaker makes $175,400. 
</P>
<P>
	Many senators and their spouses are worth millions, a select few  
many times that. Among the richest in 1998 were John D. Rockefeller 
IV, D-W.Va.; Herb Kohl, D-Wis.; Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass.; Frank 
Lautenberg, D-N.J., and freshman Peter Fitzgerald, R-Ill. 
</P>
<P>
	Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., and Minority Leader Tom  
Daschle, D-S.D., are far from those financial big leagues. 
Assistant Democratic leader Harry Reid of Nevada and Lott's deputy, 
Don Nickles of Oklahoma, are also men of comparatively modest 
means, although Reid has a substantial real estate portfolio and 
Nickles' account was busy in investments. 
</P>
<P>
	Friday's forms provided a limited peek into the assets,  
liabilities and outside earnings of senators; the House will 
release its forms next Wednesday. Since congressional rules do not 
require precise net worth statements, the values usually are 
expressed in broad ranges. 
</P>
<P>
	Some details do emerge. For example:  
</P>
<P>
	-- Bunning, R-Ky., who pitched a perfect game in 1964 for the  
Philadelphia Phillies, earned $34,884 from baseball card shows and 
other memorabilia activities. Bunning, inducted into the Hall of 
Fame in 1996, received a waiver to accept a free trip to 
Cooperstown, N.Y., for last July's ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Thurmond, R-S.C., valued four burial plots in Aiken, S.C., at  
between $1,001-$15,000. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Fred Thompson, R-Tenn., earned $29,286 in residuals from his  
work as a movie actor -- his credits include ``Hunt for Red 
October'' and ``In The Line of Fire'' -- prior to seeking political 
office. One acting job, the portrayal of former President Andrew 
Jackson in a play, earned Thompson a cane worth $425 made from a 
tree toppled during a tornado at The Hermitage, Jackson's home 
outside Nashville. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Barbara Mikulski, D-Md., reported a $5,000 advance for a  
planned CBS television movie of her political-mystery novel, 
``Capitol Offense.'' She also reported $5,502 in royalties and 
advances from the book. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Retiring Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y., made less with  
his royalties on four scholarly books. ``Pandemonium'' -- about the 
relations of ethnic groups -- brought in $195. The other three 
earned $151, $123 and $75. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, earned $15,160 for his musical talents.  
Hatch, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, has released two 
CDs of patriotic and inspirational music for which he composed the 
lyrics. 
</P>
<P>
	-- The wife of Chuck Robb, D-Va., Lynda, reported a 25 percent  
interest worth up to $1 million in the Texas ranch named for her 
father, President Johnson. And she reported assets up to $1 million 
in LBJ Holdings, an investment company. 
</P>
<P>
	Among Senate leaders, Daschle listed a portfolio of two-dozen  
mutual funds, but only one reached the $50,001 to $100,000 range. 
The Democratic leader, whose wife is a lobbyist, also owns two 
rental apartments in Washington's Virginia suburbs and one in Sioux 
Falls, S.D. -- each worth between $50,001 and $100,000 and producing 
$5,001-$15,000 in annual income. 
</P>
<P>
	Lott's major assets include a one-half partnership in six rental  
apartments in Mississippi with a combined value of 
$50,001-$100,000, three investment funds worth between $1,001 and 
$15,000 and 161 unimproved acres in his home state worth up to 
$100,000. Most of the family assets are in Lott's wife's name and 
all are valued at $50,000 and under. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the richest senators, Lautenberg is still reaping huge  
financial rewards from Automatic Data Processing, the payroll 
services company he co-founded. His shares in ADP are worth between 
$5 million and $25 million and he has two blind trusts that 
together produced income of more than $5 million. 
</P>
<P>
	But Lautenberg's fortune pales next to Rockefeller's three blind  
trusts -- one worth more than $50 million, another valued between 
$25 million and $50 million and a third between $5 million and $25 
million. The most valuable trust earned between $1,000,001 and $5 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	The West Virginia Democrat listed one liability, between  
$500,000 and $1 million, with a Charleston bank. 
</P>
<P>
	Fitzgerald is the newest member of the top financial tier,  
listing holdings worth between $25.6 million and $51.5 million. The 
vast majority is in Bank of Montreal stock he inherited after his 
father sold his suburban Chicago banking empire. 
</P>
<P>
	Kohl, owner of the Milwaukee Bucks basketball team, reported a  
blind trust worth more than $50 million -- mostly in real estate 
investments in Milwaukee -- that earned more than $5 million. The 
NBA franchise is valued at more than $50 million and earned $27.5 
million in gross receipts. 
</P>
<P>
	Wisconsin can also claim a senator at the other end of the  
financial spectrum: Democrat Russell Feingold reported little but a 
state retirement system account valued at between $15,001 and 
$50,000. 
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Mayors Push for Tough Gun Safety Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- The U.S. Conference of Mayors is urging House  
Speaker Dennis Hastert to press for swift passage of legislation 
requiring higher age restrictions for all firearms buyers and 
background checks for all customers at gun shows. 
</P>
<P>
	The mayors' proposal, contained in a letter to the Illinois  
Republican, is more stringent than pending House legislation. Their 
plan includes raising the legal age of gun buyers from 18 to 21 and 
limiting purchases to one gun a month. 
</P>
<P>
	``The time is ripe for meaningful change,'' New Orleans Mayor  
Marc Morial told a news conference Friday, the opening day of the 
mayors' 67th annual meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are engaged in a multifront movement. In this letter we are  
focusing on the United States House of Representatives. We want a 
meaningful bill with teeth,'' Morial said. 
</P>
<P>
	Leaders of more than 300 communities gathered for the five-day  
meeting to discuss such topics as urban development, health and 
human services, welfare reform and fair housing. 
</P>
<P>
	But no issue was expected to draw more attention than the search  
for ways to defuse the lethal mix of guns and young people. 
</P>
<P>
	Spurred to action by the high school shootings in Littleton,  
Colo., President Clinton and congressional leaders have wrangled 
over the best way to balance safety concerns and gun owners' 
rights. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorney General Janet Reno criticized the pending House  
legislation Friday, saying it would undermine the Senate's 
``common-sense'' effort to stop criminals from buying weapons at 
gun shows. 
</P>
<P>
	The House bill, she told reporters, would narrow the definition  
of ``gun show'' and restrict the time police have to complete 
background checks of prospective gun buyers at such events. In 
addition, she said, the bill would not cover many places where guns 
are often sold, such as flea markets. 
</P>
<P>
	The mayors maintain they are central to the debate, the first  
line of government to bear the social costs when a young person 
fires a gun at school or when an innocent is shot in the streets. 
</P>
<P>
	``We live with these tragedies every day,'' Morial said.  
</P>
<P>
	Clinton told the mayors in a videotaped message shown here that  
House Republicans ``seem intent on ignoring the lessons of 
Littleton.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We want more police on the street and fewer guns in the hands  
of criminals and children. They want more guns on the street and 
fewer cops,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	Scott King, mayor of Gary Ind., said the conference's gun  
violence task force has met twice with firearm industry 
representatives to discuss ways to limit easy access to guns. 
</P>
<P>
	``They went back on what they committed to do,'' said King. ``We  
are going to put faces on the statistics. I have had to bury a 
2-year-old child and a police officer. We say enough is enough.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The spread of gun violence outside urban areas has keyed the  
nation's quest for greater gun safety, said St. Louis Mayor 
Clarence Harmon. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now that we are seeing the violence move from the inner city  
to become a suburban issue and now a rural issue, it is beginning 
to galvanize the public,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Since last year's mayors meeting, 20 cities including New  
Orleans, Chicago, Cleveland, Boston and Newark have sued gun makers 
on grounds that they failed to incorporate available safety 
features on the weapons such as locking devices. 
</P>
<P>
	``The technology needed for safer guns is out there,'' said  
Morial, who filed the first gun industry lawsuit but saw the 
Louisiana state legislature pass a law making it illegal for 
individual cities to sue the gun industry. Morial plans to pursue 
the suit anyway, saying legislation that seeks to nullify a 
previously filed lawsuit ``is destined for a swift constitutional 
death in the courts.''

<HEADLINE> Sports Cars a Big Hit in Japan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- With the nation battling its worst recession since  
World War II, most Japanese are worried about just keeping their 
heads above water. Others are going out and buying sports cars. 
</P>
<P>
	Sports car sales are soaring, the solitary glimmer of hope in an  
otherwise plunging auto market. Domestic automakers are the biggest 
winners in the fad, but European models are selling briskly as 
well. American brands are once again a hard sell. 
</P>
<P>
	Taizo Uno is a typical buyer.  
</P>
<P>
	The college student scrounged and saved while working at a  
McDonald's to buy his dream car, a $28,000 silver Honda S2000 
convertible. ``Driving through the mountains with the top down -- 
it's the ultimate,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The two-seat S2000, which marks Honda Motor Co.'s return to the  
sports car market after 30 years, has drawn more than 5,800 orders 
since rolling into showrooms in mid-April, though Honda plans to 
sell only 500 of the roadsters a month. 
</P>
<P>
	The S2000 will go on sale next fall in the United States, where  
it also is expected to sell well. More sedate models with a sporty 
look, like the Toyota Altezza that will be sold as a Lexus in the 
United States next year, also are proving to be hot sellers here. 
</P>
<P>
	Eager to keep abreast of the sports car blitz, Toyota Motor  
Corp. is likely to bring to Japan soon its soft-top roadster, the 
MR-Spyder. A concept version was unveiled at Chicago's auto show in 
February. The roadster is scheduled to go on sale in the United 
States in early 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	European brands, which are considered more stylish and  
high-status by Japanese drivers, are holding steady with their 
sports car sales. All 50 of the new $113,000 BMW M5 sports car 
available here, for example, were sold out when orders were taken 
in April. 
</P>
<P>
	Mazda Motor Corp., in which Ford Motor Co. has a controlling  
share, has managed to do well with the new RX-7 sports car that 
went on sale in January with greater horsepower and a lower price 
tag of $24,000, down from $27,000. 
</P>
<P>
	RX-7 sales have now hit about 2,000.  
</P>
<P>
	``The sports car genre is so hot now, simply coming out with a  
new model guarantees buyers are going to snatch it up,'' Mazda 
spokesman Hideo Azuma said. 
</P>
<P>
	But American sports cars generally have stirred little  
excitement here -- yet another chapter in the chronic tale of U.S. 
automakers' battle against their clunker image in this notoriously 
finicky market. 
</P>
<P>
	Just 287 of the General Motors Corp. Chevrolet Corvettes were  
sold here over the last year. Even Ford's reskinned Mustang sports 
coupe, which arrived in Japan last month, has attracted only 30 
orders so far. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not interested in American cars,'' said businessman  
Kazuyuki Sakai, who just bought a Honda S2000 and also owns an Alfa 
Romeo. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this month, the Clinton administration said sales of  
U.S.-made cars in Japan fell by 35 percent in 1998 and declined 29 
percent during the first quarter of this year compared with the 
first quarter of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. imports from General Motors, Ford and DaimlerChrysler AG  
still comprise a mere 1 percent of Japan's auto market. 
</P>
<P>
	Washington says the reason behind the U.S. automakers'  
difficulty in making headway in Japan is the closed market. The 
government and U.S. automakers have continued to prod Tokyo to ease 
regulations. 
</P>
<P>
	American car companies tend to see the sports car market here as  
too small a niche to be worth their while and haven't brought many 
over. A couple of years ago, the former Chrysler Corp. said it 
planned to bring to Japan the Dodge Viper sports car -- a powerful 
image booster. It never did. ``It's important in the auto industry 
to have image vehicles in the product lineup,'' said Steve Usher, 
an auto analyst with Jardine Fleming in Tokyo. ``People walk in a 
showroom and see the S2000 and walk out with an Accord.''

<HEADLINE> Canada To Hold Hydrogen Fuel Test </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	VANCOUVER, British Columbia (AP) -- Proponents of pollution-free  
hydrogen fuel-cell cars took a major step towards commercialization 
Friday, announcing a pilot project to develop the essential 
refueling network. 
</P>
<P>
	The five-year agreement involves oil company Petro-Canada,  
fuel-cell developer Ballard Power Systems and Methanex Corp., the 
world's biggest supplier of methanol -- a prime candidate to become 
the fuel source for hydrogen-powered vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
	Safe, convenient refueling will be crucial to the success of  
such vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
	Ballard's partners, Ford Motor Co. and DaimlerChrysler AG, say  
they plan to begin selling hydrogen fuel-cell cars by 2004. They 
would be powered by fuel cells that make electricity by chemically 
combining hydrogen and air without combustion. 
</P>
<P>
	Ballard chairman Firoz Rasul said the automakers hope that by  
2010, as much as 25 percent of their production will be fuel-cell 
cars. 
</P>
<P>
	When pure hydrogen is used, the only byproducts are water and  
heat. For now, vehicles will get hydrogen by on-board conversion 
from other fuels, including natural gas, gasoline or methanol. 
</P>
<P>
	Supporters of methanol, manufactured from natural gas, see it as  
nearly ideal because it can be distributed and pumped much like 
gasoline. 
</P>
<P>
	Indy racing cars burn pure methanol and a methanol-gasoline  
blend is already sold as an alternate fuel for specially adapted 
vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
	Pierre Choquette, chief executive of Methanex, said  
methanol-powered fuel-cell cars will generate some carbon dioxide, 
but will produce no smog-creating pollutants such as carbon 
monoxide and oxides of nitrogen. 
</P>
<P>
	Rasul said the first stage of the program will be to study  
possible locations for methanol pumps. The most likely initial 
spots are gas stations in the Vancouver area, where both Ballard 
and Methanex are based. 
</P>
<P>
	Rasul said it's hoped automakers will decide within 12 months to  
join the project and supply vehicles for the testing phase, similar 
to a fuel-cell demonstration program announced in California. 
</P>
<P>
	Both Ford and DaimlerChrysler have fuel-cell prototype cars that  
run on methanol. Testing so far indicates they can travel up to 300 
miles on a single tank, comparable to gasoline-powered cars.

<HEADLINE> S. Korea Navy Repels N. Korea Ships </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- South Korean patrol boats bumped three  
North Korean vessels today, forcing them out of disputed waters on 
the fourth day of a tense armed standoff. 
</P>
<P>
	But after initially retreating, four North Korean warships  
sailed back into the disputed zone, confronting eight South Korean 
navy ships, South Korea's Defense Ministry said. 
</P>
<P>
	There was no gunfire when the vessels collided earlier, but the  
ships trained their guns on each other and it nearly became an 
armed clash, South Korean lawmaker Han Young-soo said. 
</P>
<P>
	The confrontation came after South Korea began massing  
destroyers and other combat ships early today to end the standoff. 
</P>
<P>
	North Korean warships have been sailing in and out of rich crab  
fishing areas in the disputed waters since Tuesday. Their main 
mission appears to be guarding northern fishing vessels operating 
in the area, ministry officials said on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	Six North Korean patrol boats again took up positions in the  
area before dawn today, escorting about a dozen fishing boats, the 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Four South Korean high-speed patrol boats intentionally bumped  
into the North Korean ships, said a South Korean Navy lieutenant 
commander who gave only his last name, Han. Three northern ships 
suffered ``substantial damage'' and retreated along with the other 
three, he said, adding that one southern ship suffered a hole in 
its hull. 
</P>
<P>
	``The situation came close to an armed clash,'' lawmaker Han  
Young-soo told reporters after a closed-door briefing by navy 
officials. ``After the collision, the North Korean ships trained 
their guns at us, and we responded in kind. It was a close call.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Defense Ministry spokesman Brig. Gen. Cha Young-koo said South  
Korea aims ``to resolve the issue peacefully, but we can't let the 
situation drag on ... We'll use all means to end it at whatever 
cost.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ministry officials said scores of frigates, destroyers and other  
combat ships will be sent to the area. The army and air force will 
provide support in case of emergency, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	The disputed waters lie south of a U.N.-imposed sea border,  
midway between the North Korean mainland and five South Korean 
islands, 60 miles northwest of Seoul. North Korea has contested the 
sea border since the late 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
	The American-led U.N. Command, for the second time this week,  
asked North Korea to hold a border military meeting to discuss the 
situation. North Korea had rejected an earlier request by the 
command. 
</P>
<P>
	The two Koreas, divided into the communist North and the  
capitalist South in 1945, remain technically at war, with no peace 
treaty signed at the end of the 1950-53 Korean War. Their border is 
the world's most heavily armed, with nearly 2 million troops 
deployed on both sides. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.N. Command and North Korea signed the armistice that ended  
the Korean conflict. But they never agreed on a border in the 
Yellow Sea off the western coast. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.N. Command unilaterally demarcated the maritime frontier  
in 1953 and created a buffer zone south of it to avoid armed 
clashes. 
</P>
<P>
	North Korea has been sending fishing boats and naval ships into  
the zone 20 to 30 times a year. But when challenged by South Korean 
patrol boats, they usually withdrew quickly.

</P>
<P>
	BERKELEY, Calif. (AP) -- Ann L. Brown, a professor whose work  
focused on how children learn and how they should be taught, died 
June 4 after a brief illness. She was 56. 
</P>
<P>
	Since 1988, Ms. Brown was an educational theorist at the School  
of Education at the University of California, Berkeley. Many of her 
ideas were tested in classroom environments and adopted by 
educational scholars. 
</P>
<P>
	Born in an air raid shelter in Portsmouth, England, during World  
War II, Ms. Brown was the first in her family to attend college. 
</P>
<P>
	She did not learn to read until she was 13, but graduated with  
honors from the University of London and later earned a Ph.D. in 
psychology. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Brown pioneered the field of metacognition, the study of how  
people observe and take responsibility for their own learning. Her 
teaching methods focused on reciprocal teaching, in which students 
learn from each other.

<P>
	MEMPHIS, Tenn. (AP) -- Wayne Chastain, one of the defense lawyers  
who tried to free convicted murderer James Earl Ray from prison, 
died Monday of cancer. He was 69. 
</P>
<P>
	Over the past several years, Chastain assisted defense lawyer  
William Pepper of London in efforts to win a trial for Ray, who 
pleaded guilty in 1969 to murdering Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. in 
Memphis in 1968. 
</P>
<P>
	Ray died last year in prison.  
</P>
<P>
	Chastain was a reporter for The Memphis Press-Scimitar, a former  
newspaper, when King was felled by a rifle shot at The Lorraine 
Motel. 
</P>
<P>
	He was one of The Press-Scimitar's reporters assigned to cover  
the assassination, and the killing continued to hold his interest 
after he left journalism to become a lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
	Chastain is survived by his stepmother.

	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Bob Cochran, one of the original on-air  
personalities at former Pittsburgh television station WIIC-TV, died 
May 30. He was 68. 
</P>
<P>
	Cochran was one of six staffers when the station went on the air  
in 1957. He was the weather reporter for the station's first year 
and then became a co-anchor of the newscast. The station is now 
known as WPXI. 
</P>
<P>
	He moved to Atlanta after retiring from Pittsburgh radio station  
KQV in 1991, where he had moved in 1975 after 18 years with the 
television station. 
</P>
<P>
	Cochran is survived by his wife, Sandra Keisling; two sons; a  
daughter; and two grandchildren.

<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Christina Foyle, managing director of her family's  
renowned bookstore in London's Charing Cross Road and founder of 
the Foyle's literary luncheon, died Tuesday. She was 88. 
</P>
<P>
	W &AMP; G Foyle Ltd. was founded in 1904 by Miss Foyle's father,  
William, and her uncle, Gilbert. 
</P>
<P>
	Over the seven decades she presided over Foyle's lunches, Miss  
Foyle met many leading literary and political figures. Her 
cherished collection of personal correspondence included a letter 
from Adolf Hitler, responding to her complaint about Nazi 
book-burning. 
</P>
<P>
	Speakers at her lunches included the writer J. B. Priestley,  
philosopher Bertrand Russell and Ethiopian leader Haile Selassie. 
</P>
<P>
	When she took over as managing director of Foyle's after her  
father's death in 1963, Miss Foyle preserved the store's eccentric 
layout -- books were filed by publisher, not author. And she refused 
to install computers. 
</P>
<P>
	But Foyle's continued to generate annual profits of more than  
$24 million.

The New Ulm Daily Journal for 28 years and worked for the 
Associated Press for 12 years, died Tuesday at age 81. 
</P>
<P>
	He was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease in 1991.

</P>
<P>
	Macklin went to the University of Missouri, where he was editor  
of the school newspaper his senior year. After graduation, he 
worked for a Springfield, Mo., newspaper for a short time before 
going to work in the AP's St. Louis bureau until he was drafted 
into the military in 1941. 
</P>
<P>
	After the war, he covered sports for the AP in London before  
returning to the United States to work in the AP's Kansas City 
bureau in 1949. Two years later, he responded to an ad from the New

<HEADLINE> Sweepstakes Co. Violated Agreement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) -- A federal judge has found American Family  
Publishers in contempt for violating a deal in which the company 
agreed to tone down its contest promotions mailed to North Carolina 
households. 
</P>
<P>
	Chief U.S. District Judge Terrence Boyle found the sweepstakes  
company in civil contempt of a 1993 settlement that ended a lawsuit 
against the company's practices. 
</P>
<P>
	The settlement said American Family Publishers would stop using  
``language of congratulations or other prizewinning declarations 
which, when considered in context ... represents that the recipient 
of the envelope has won a prize.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The judge's order became public Monday. A hearing to address  
potential damages will be held June 29. 
</P>
<P>
	Spokeswomen for the Jersey City, N.J., company and its Raleigh  
attorneys did not immediately return phone calls seeking comment 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The envelope Attorney General Mike Easley found objectionable  
stated: ``If you have the winning number, please be advised ... 
IT'S DOWN TO A 2 PERSON RACE FOR $11,000,000 -- YOU AND ONE OTHER 
PERSON IN N. CAROLINA WERE ISSUED THE WINNING NUMBER (number) -- 
WHOEVER RETURNS IT FIRST WINS IT ALL!'' 
</P>
<P>
	The company had argued that the lead-in phrase in uncapitalized  
type qualified the conditions to be a sweepstakes winner and showed 
it was abiding by the settlement. Boyle said he didn't buy it. 
</P>
<P>
	Sweepstakes firms defended their industry at a congressional  
hearing in March, saying most Americans understand that no purchase 
is needed to win. Congress is considering a bill that would levy 
stiff fines against companies that mislead consumers.

<HEADLINE> Sharks Re-Signs Center Damphousse </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- The San Jose Sharks on Friday re-signed  
center Vincent Damphousse, a late-season acquisition who helped the 
team reach the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	Terms of the deal were not announced.  
</P>
<P>
	Damphousse, 31, was acquired from Montreal last season for  
several draft picks. He has 347 goals and 582 assists in his career 
and played in his 1,000th game with the Sharks on April 6. 
</P>
<P>
	Last season, he had 19 goals and 30 assists in 77 games,  
including 12 games with San Jose. 
</P>
<P>
	``We saw what the addition of a a player of Vinnie's caliber  
meant to our team last season,'' general manager Dean Lombardi 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was a major factor in us making the playoffs and makes us  
stronger up the middle, is creative in the offensive zone and 
significantly upgrades our special teams,'' he added. 
</P>
<P>
	The seventh-seeded Sharks lost to Colorado in six games in the  
opening round of the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	Damphousse, a two-time all-star, began his career with Toronto,  
playing there for five seasons, followed by a year in Edmonton and 
seven seasons with Montreal before being traded to San Jose.

<HEADLINE> Preparedness Expo Readies for Y2K </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT WASHINGTON, Pa. (AP) -- Militia man John Trochmann says the  
whole Y2K craze was staged by the federal government. 
</P>
<P>
	So with the millenium less than seven months away, Trochmann  
believes you might as well be prepared for the worst. And his book 
stand at Preparedness Expo '99 in suburban Philadelphia is the 
perfect place to start, he says. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are certain elements of the government that planned (the  
Y2K craze) this way. It doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure 
that out,'' says Trochmann, a Navy veteran and a member of the 
Militia of Montana. 
</P>
<P>
	Trochmann was one of about 200 vendors who set up shop at the  
Fort Washington Expo Center on Friday for the opening of the 
weekend-long exposition, which is designed to offer products that 
help people prepare for emergencies. 
</P>
<P>
	Aisles were lined with showcases on everything from freeze-dried  
foods to power generators to first-aid kits and holistic healing 
remedies. 
</P>
<P>
	Promoter Dan Chittock, who has helped set up the event since its  
first year in Salt Lake City 10 years ago, says the expo has 
attracted extra attention lately. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have been especially busy this year because of the Year  
2000 computer glitch problem,'' Chittock says. ``People are coming 
because if you are prepared, you don't have to be worried about 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chittock promotes the Preparedness Expo, which is making nine  
stops around the country, as an event ``for peace of mind in our 
changing world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It usually attracts outdoors enthusiasts, health-conscious  
people, and those who work in the emergency management field, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Lately, more Y2K worriers have been in attendance. Many believe  
computers will break down and malfunction when the calendar hits 
2000 because they were originally programmed to interpret the 
``00'' as 1900. 
</P>
<P>
	Some think that could lead to electricity being cut off and bank  
accounts wiped out. Others think it could even lead to a breakdown 
in social order. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel that the media is downplaying the whole issue,'' said  
expo attendee Michael Leon, 36, of Hempstead, N.Y. ``We can't rely 
on the government because they won't be able to help.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So Leon strolled the aisles looking for items he said he could  
stockpile in case of disaster. 
</P>
<P>
	One stand sold unusual items such as ``The Miracle Trigger'', a  
$20 device resembling a water pistol that vendor Mary Enna, of 
Divide, Colo. said uses a brief electrical pulse to ``break the 
cycle of pain'' -- which she said could be useful in an emergency 
situation. 
</P>
<P>
	Nearby, representatives of Long Beach, Calif.-based Organic by  
Nature talked about their plant-based dried juice products. Some of 
the main ingredients include grass and barley. 
</P>
<P>
	``It taste like tea or spinach, depending on who you ask,''  
operations manager Amy Veneer said. ``But add it in with apple 
juice and it tastes real good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Critics say shows like Chittock's unjustly feed into Y2K  
paranoia. Organizations like the American Red Cross advise the 
public to prepare for the millenium by stocking disaster supplies 
for several days and keeping some extra cash on hand. 
</P>
<P>
	Richard Landis of Boston University's Center for Millenial  
Studies said the attention being paid today to the Y2K problem is 
part paranoia, part legitimate. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the greatest deadline in the history of mankind,''  
Landis said. ``It looks like it may not be disastrous, but we're 
not out of the woods yet.''

<HEADLINE> Americans Favor 1st Lady Senate Run </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- It's fine for a president's spouse to run for  
office, say three out of four Americans surveyed for an Associated 
Press poll. And when it comes to Hillary Rodham Clinton and New 
York's Senate seat, a majority, though a smaller one, says she 
should run. 
</P>
<P>
	The drop-off to 54 percent who favor a run by Mrs. Clinton is  
largely due to the attitudes of GOP voters. 
</P>
<P>
	The poll, conducted by ICR of Media, Pa., found that 65 percent  
of Republicans said seeking elective office was appropriate for a 
presidential spouse, while 34 percent said this particular 
presidential spouse should run. Among Democrats, 85 percent said 
running for office was appropriate in general, and 77 percent said 
Mrs. Clinton should run. Half of independent voters said she should 
run. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton recently said she would form an exploratory  
committee to help her decide whether to seek the Senate seat held 
by Democrat Daniel Patrick Moynihan, who is retiring. She was 
running neck and neck with New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, a 
Republican, in polls of New York voters taken late this spring. 
</P>
<P>
	Elizabeth Dole, a candidate for the GOP presidential nomination  
and wife of 1996 Republican nominee Bob Dole, said in an interview 
with The Associated Press this week that Mrs. Clinton should be 
able to run ``if that's what she wants to do and if the people of 
New York want her to do it. ... She's certainly a very bright lady. 
That's up to her.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The telephone poll of 1,016 American adults was taken Friday  
through Tuesday. The margin of sampling error was plus or minus 3 
percentage points. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton's approval rating stood at 58 percent in the poll  
while President Clinton got a mixed review, with 48 percent saying 
they had a favorable opinion of him, 44 percent unfavorable. 
</P>
<P>
	``She's qualified, a smart lady. She's gone to law school. She's  
got a lot of ideas and had some nice health ideas,'' said Andrew 
Eckman, a 46-year-old manager of a comedy basketball team in 
Springfield, Mass. ``I pursue my dreams. She should be able to.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But some who thought it was appropriate for a president's spouse  
to run for office didn't want Mrs. Clinton to run for the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	``If a person grew up in a state and then came back and wanted  
to run, that would be OK,'' said Leo Wiser, a 44-year-old carpenter 
in North Charleston, S.C., who was born near Binghamton, N.Y. 
``Every time I've heard Mrs. Clinton asked about what's going on in 
New York, she gravitates towards the city. I wonder if maybe she 
should try for representative of the city.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The sentiment for Mrs. Clinton to run and the number who think  
it is appropriate for a president's spouse to run dropped for 
respondents 55 and older. 
</P>
<P>
	``She should be a writer and lecturer,'' said Elizabeth  
Smothers, a 57-year-old Republican from Boaz, Ala. ``She'd be out 
there for everybody who wanted to pay to see her, but I would never 
have to hear from her again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	About one-third of those polled said they thought Mrs. Clinton  
would be most effective as a senator, with the remainder divided on 
whether she would have more influence as the head of a foundation, 
writer and lecturer or lawyer. Women and people with lower incomes 
were more likely to think senator would be her most effective role. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton's campaign would be ``so unique that I don't think  
it will tell us anything generally about women in politics,'' said 
Jean Bethke Elshtain, a professor of social and political ethics at 
the University of Chicago and specialist on women in politics. 
``She's a known figure, has instant recognizability and can draw on 
enormous resources from her husband's network.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But her out-of-state background could be a vulnerable point in  
New York, said Lee Miringoff, director of the Marist College 
Institute of Public Opinion in Poughkeepsie. 
</P>
<P>
	``Over half in our poll said this concerned them a great deal or  
somewhat. This will be one of the main targets of attack.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So far the race looks like the typical match-up between a  
Republican and a Democrat, he said, noting the natural strength of 
Democrats in New York City and the Republican base upstate. Since 
both are well-known, the campaign strategy will be more crucial for 
both than winning name recognition. 
</P>
<P>
	``Millions of dollars will be spent working on each other's  
negatives in a way that might be off the charts,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Bond Prices Fall Again / Bonds  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Bond prices tumbled Friday, pushing up yields on  
30-year Treasury issues to the highest level in 19 months. 
</P>
<P>
	The price of the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond fell 1 3/16  
points, or $11.88 per $1,000 in face value. Its yield, which moves 
in the opposite direction, shot up to 6.16 percent from 6.06 
percent on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	That was the highest closing yield for the long-term bonds since  
the 6.20 percent of Nov. 7, 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Once again, fears of the Federal Reserve raising interest rates  
led to a selloff in bonds. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders, already nervous about the prospect that the Fed would  
push rates higher at a meeting at month's end, were further 
unsettled as rumors circulated that the Fed would act as quickly as 
Friday afternoon. There was also talk that Tiger Management LLC, a 
hedge fund, was seeking help from the Fed. 
</P>
<P>
	A Fed spokesman declined to comment, but traders said both  
rumors were quickly shot down. 
</P>
<P>
	The bond market has been preoccupied with the Fed amid concern  
that it will move to prevent the economy from overheating by 
pushing up interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
	If rates rise in the open market, the value of bonds already in  
circulation would fall. 
</P>
<P>
	There were fresh signs Friday of strength in an economy that  
already is in the longest peacetime expansion ever. 
</P>
<P>
	The Commerce Department reported that retail sales rose 1  
percent in May, extending a long string of gains. Also, the 
University of Michigan's consumer sentiment index rose to 
better-than-expected levels, showing that Americans remain upbeat 
thanks to the strong U.S. economy. 
</P>
<P>
	In the broader market, prices of short-term Treasury securities  
were off by between 3/16 point and 7/32 point and intermediate 
maturities were off between 9/32 point and 3/4 point, reported Bridge 
Telerate, a financial information service. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields on three-month Treasury bills were 4.72 percent as the  
discount surged 0.07 percentage point from Thursday to 4.60 
percent. Six-month yields were 5.08 percent, as the discount added 
0.06 percentage point to 4.88 percent. One-year yields were 5.12 
percent as the discount rose 0.03 percentage point to 4.87 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields are the interest bonds pay by maturity, while the  
discount is the interest at which they are sold. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between  
banks, fell to 4.75 percent from 4.81 percent late Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively  
traded municipal bonds fell 19/32 to 119 1/16. The average yield to 
maturity rose to 5.54 percent from 5.51 percent late Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Jury Awards Ex-Boxer $10.7M in Suit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- The actual fight lasted just 70 seconds.  
The legal battle took several years. And Randall ``Tex'' Cobb won a 
$10.7 million purse. 
</P>
<P>
	A jury on Friday ordered Time Inc. to pay $10.7 million to  
ex-heavyweight boxer for a 1993 Sports Illustrated article that 
said he fixed a fight and shared cocaine with the loser. 
</P>
<P>
	``Tex has been a prisoner of this article for six years and  
there's no better feeling in the world than to have a jury come in 
and set the record straight,'' attorney George Bochetto said. 
``This jury set this man free.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cobb, 46, said the story headlined ``The Fix Was In'' ended his  
boxing career and nearly sidelined his acting pursuits. The jury 
deliberated about four hours before awarding him $2.2 million in 
punitive damages on top of the $8.5 million in compensatory damages 
it awarded Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The article described the 1992 bout between Cobb and Sonny  
Barch, a journeyman fighter and former Memphis State football 
player. The magazine said Cobb and Barch discussed how to throw the 
fight, with Cobb complaining of an injured shoulder and hoping to 
end the match quickly. 
</P>
<P>
	In the article, Barch said he told Cobb: ``I'm going to have to  
hit you to make it look good. But I won't hit your shoulder.'' 
Barch said that Cobb responded: ``Bubba, I appreciate it. I'll make 
it up to you,'' according to the article. 
</P>
<P>
	Barch allowed Cobb to hit him three times, dropping to a knee  
each time and triggering the three-knockdown rule, Sports 
Illustrated reported. Cobb was declared the winner by technical 
knockout 70 seconds into the fight. 
</P>
<P>
	The magazine also reported that Barch said he, Cobb and a fight  
promoter shared cocaine after the bout. Sports Illustrated reported 
that both Barch and Cobb had flunked post-fight drug tests and the 
fight was declared a no-contest. In a follow-up, Sports Illustrated 
said that Cobb had tested positive for marijuana. 
</P>
<P>
	Juror Steve Reynolds, a Nashville schoolteacher, said the story  
was unfair, slanted and ``based on a shady individual.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Steve Robinson, managing editor of CNN-SI and a former Sports  
Illustrated senior editor who worked on the story, said the verdict 
``shocked us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Our position is the story is accurate. The jury findings are  
not supported by the evidence,'' he said. ``We're very confident we 
will prevail on appeal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cobb, a former Nashville resident who now lives in Philadelphia,  
has had roles in several movies, including ``Liar, Liar,'' 
``Raising Arizona,'' ``Uncommon Valor'' and ``The Golden Child.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The $2.2 million in punitive damages is approximately how much  
Sports Illustrated made in net income per issue last year, 
according to testimony. Sports Illustrated, a subsidiary of Time 
Inc., published 52 issues last year and reported earnings of more 
than $112 million.

<HEADLINE> Report: Lakers Offer Jackson Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Phil Jackson, who coached the Chicago Bulls  
to six NBA championships in the 1990s, has reportedly been offered 
a four-year deal worth more than $20 million to coach the Los 
Angeles Lakers. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson's agent, Todd Musburger, is in ``serious negotiations''  
with the Lakers, Fox Sports News reported Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
	The network said a source familiar with the negotiations said  
the deal could be finalized within the next few days. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can't confirm it, we can't deny it,'' Lakers owner Jerry  
Buss said of the report following the Los Angeles Sparks' WNBA 
opener Thursday night at the Forum. ``I've been out of town. I've 
got to talk to Jerry West. We'll see.'' 
</P>
<P>
	West, the team's executive vice president of basketball  
operations, told the Los Angeles Times the Lakers have explored the 
possibility of offering the coaching job to Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
	However, West said no offer has been made to Jackson, and ``it  
would be wrong to presume a deal was near.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We've talked about a lot of different parameters to a couple  
different people,'' said West, who added the team has had similar 
discussions with Kurt Rambis, who finished the season as interim 
coach. ``There's going to be a lot of speculation out there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	West also said Jackson ``would make a very attractive candidate,  
yes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	West said he has not spoken to Jackson, but did not comment when  
asked if he had been speaking with Musberger, who told the Times he 
would have no comment on the matter for now. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson was on vacation in Alaska and unavailable for comment.  
</P>
<P>
	Jackson left the Bulls after they won their sixth championship  
last June, and didn't coach this season. Several other teams, 
including the New York Knicks and New Jersey Nets, also are 
reportedly interested in hiring Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lakers, swept by San Antonio in the second round of the  
playoffs, hired Rambis as interim coach after Del Harris was fired 
early in the lockout-shortened 1999 season.

<HEADLINE> White House Defends Nominations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton meant no contempt for  
Congress in appointing a gay businessman to a diplomatic post 
without Senate consent, the president's chief of staff told Senate 
Majority Leader Trent Lott in an effort to head off retaliation. 
</P>
<P>
	John Podesta appealed to the Mississippi Republican not to block  
other White House nominations in the escalating dispute over the 
appointment of James Hormel as ambassador to Luxembourg. 
</P>
<P>
	Lott remains upset about the president's tactics, Lott's  
spokesman John Czwartacki said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Czwartacki said, ``we expect this to be resolved'' before  
it threatens key nominations, including Lawrence Summers as 
treasury secretary and Richard Holbrooke as ambassador to the 
United Nations. 
</P>
<P>
	The dispute erupted a week ago during Congress' Memorial Day  
recess, when Clinton, tired of waiting for the Senate to act on his 
1997 nomination of Hormel, installed him directly. Clinton invoked 
a provision in the Constitution permitting such appointments during 
congressional recesses. 
</P>
<P>
	With his ``recess appointment,'' Hormel can serve without Senate  
approval until the end of the next session of Congress -- the end of 
2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Lott denounced the practice, suggesting he was blindsided. And  
Sen. James Inhofe, R-Okla., announced he would try to block every 
presidential civilian appointment to protest the move. 
</P>
<P>
	Podesta took ``significant issue'' with Inhofe's assertion that  
Clinton demonstrated ``contempt for Congress and the Constitution'' 
in circumventing the Senate confirmation process. 
</P>
<P>
	``The debate on Mr. Hormel is not about constitutional  
authority, it is about a very small number of senators who believe 
that sexual orientation can disqualify an exceptional nominee from 
confirmation,'' Podesta wrote in the Thursday letter. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is unfortunate that Senator Inhofe now finds cause for  
objection to this process,'' Podesta wrote. He urged Lott to resist 
joining Inhofe's protest and ``make certain that all of the 
president's nominees receive fair consideration before the full 
Senate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lott has said that he agrees with Inhofe's complaints, even  
though it was not his ``inclination'' to place a hold on all other 
nominations ``indefinitely.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Czwartacki said Lott has not changed his position but wants to  
work out a deal in which the president would promise to refrain 
from bypassing the Senate with high-profile recess appointments. 
</P>
<P>
	``Senator Lott does agree with Senator Inhofe that this practice  
of naming controversial appointments during short recesses without 
much prior consultation is a practice that can't be sustained. It 
has to be stopped,'' Czwartacki said. 
</P>
<P>
	Inhofe said he was only following a precedent set by Sen. Robert  
C. Byrd, D-W.Va., in 1985, when Byrd as minority leader blocked 
President Reagan's appointments until Reagan agreed to refrain from 
further recess appointments. 
</P>
<P>
	Lott wants the same sort of pledge from Clinton, Czwartacki  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	But Podesta, in his letter, said, ``Any fair reading of the  
record of that period demonstrates clearly that Sen. Byrd and 
Senate Democrats simply sought to secure the very consultation and 
courtesies now provided by this administration to Senate 
Republicans.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The White House says it did give Lott advance word of Hormel's  
upcoming recess appointment. Republicans argued the word came 
shortly before the appointment was announced on the final day of 
the week-long Memorial Day recess. 
</P>
<P>
	By custom, any senator can place a ``hold'' on any nomination.  
But usually they are done on individual nominees, and not en masse. 
And the majority leader does not have to honor them. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Democrats have said that if Inhofe makes good on his  
threat, and it is honored by Lott, they will stage their own 
protest. 
</P>
<P>
	``We would have to respond as well,'' perhaps by seeking to  
block committees from meeting and stalling GOP-sought legislation, 
said Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D. 
</P>
<P>
	Daschle said this would lead to ``a messy set of circumstances  
if things aren't resolved.''

<HEADLINE> FCC Looks To Improve Rural Internet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Federal Communications Commission will  
consider ways to ensure high-speed Internet access in rural areas, 
including subsidizing the improvements and easing government 
regulations, the panel's chairman says. 
</P>
<P>
	The Internet ``is as important to rural America as the highway  
system was in the 1940s and 1950s and the railroads were at the 
turn of the century,'' Bill Kennard said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Kennard met for an hour with a group of farm-state Senate  
Democrats, led by Minority Leader Tom Daschle of South Dakota, who 
are pushing the FCC to subsidize high-speed Internet access in 
rural communities. Kennard said the commission would consider the 
idea but left a brief news conference without taking questions on 
the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
	The FCC will ask telecommunications companies whether it needs  
to ease regulations to improve Internet access in rural areas. The 
agency also plans to hold field hearings, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	He did not say what regulatory changes the commission would  
consider. 
</P>
<P>
	Under a 1996 law, rural areas are supposed to have  
telecommunications services that are ``reasonably comparable'' to 
those in cities, but it was left up to the FCC to decide how to do 
that. 
</P>
<P>
	The government already is handing out nearly $1.7 billion in  
subsidies to schools and libraries this year, including those in 
rural areas and inner cities, for a variety of telecommunications 
needs, including Internet access. 
</P>
<P>
	The FCC recently voted to boost that funding to $2.25 billion,  
despite concerns that it would cause higher telephone charges. The 
money is collected from phone companies, which usually pass on the 
fees to customers. 
</P>
<P>
	The senators say farmers, rural businesses and small-town  
health-care facilities need access to high-speed Internet services 
for transmitting graphics and large amounts of data. 
</P>
<P>
	``As the revolution in telecommunications continues to advance,  
we cannot let our country be divided into technological haves and 
have-nots,'' said Sen. Paul Wellstone, D-Minn. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Bob Kerrey, D-Neb., said, ``There are hundreds of thousands  
of jobs at stake. There's a way of life at stake in rural areas.''

<HEADLINE> Retail Sales Up by 1 Percent in May </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Retail sales jumped by 1 percent in May as  
Americans got ready for summer with purchases from shorts to patio 
furniture. 
</P>
<P>
	The sales -- which represent about a third of the nation's  
economic output -- rose last month to a seasonally adjusted $242.2 
billion, the Commerce Department said today. 
</P>
<P>
	The May increase followed an April rise that, at a revised 0.4  
percent, was better than initially estimated, the government said. 
</P>
<P>
	Retail sales have climbed or held steady for 10 months running  
and were 7.8 percent higher than May of last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Unemployment near a 29-year low, steady income growth and stock  
market gains have whetted Americans' appetite for shopping. 
</P>
<P>
	The spending spree helped keep the U.S. economy growing at a  
strong 4.1 percent annual rate during the first three months of 
this year, despite economic turmoil elsewhere around the globe. 
</P>
<P>
	However, a 0.7 percent rise in consumer prices in April, the  
most in nearly nine years, has some analysts wary that if inflation 
continues, consumers might begin to trim their spending in 
response. 
</P>
<P>
	Gas prices have risen most sharply, and sales at gasoline  
service stations did drop in May, by 0.8 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	But most other retail categories showed strong increases in  
sales last month. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales of durable goods -- items expected to last three years or  
more -- jumped 1.8 percent in May, after slipping in March and 
April. 
</P>
<P>
	Automotive sales, up a big 2.5 percent, were a major factor.  
However, even without the often volatile autos category, total 
retail sales climbed 0.5 percent in May. 
</P>
<P>
	Furniture stores saw their sales increase by 1.1 percent in May.  
Building supply, hardware and garden stores' sales fell 0.5 
percent, but had been buoyed by a 1.5 percent April gain and remain 
strong. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales of nondurable goods, such as food and fuel, were up 0.3  
percent in May. 
</P>
<P>
	At apparel and accessory shops, sales have risen every month so  
far this year and in May were up by 0.5 percent. Department and 
general merchandise store sales recovered with a 0.9 percent 
increase, after dropping 0.3 percent in April. 
</P>
<P>
	Food and grocery store sales were up 0.7 percent in May, while  
bar and restaurant patronage held steady. At drug and other 
proprietary stores, sales increased 0.6 percent.

<HEADLINE> Pilot Guilty of Conspiracy in Crash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT STEWART, Ga. (AP) -- An Army pilot was convicted Friday of  
taking his wife and the wife of a co-pilot on an unauthorized 
helicopter ride in the Bahamas that ended in a crash that killed 
both women. 
</P>
<P>
	A military judge spared 38-year-old Chief Warrant Officer David  
Guido from prison time and dismissal from the Army, instead giving 
him a reprimand and a total of $10,000 in fines and forfeited pay. 
</P>
<P>
	Guido testified that he took his wife on the flight to reward  
her for her support and to share his love of flying with her. 
</P>
<P>
	``She knew how much aviation meant to me,'' he said through  
tears. ``She was an active participant in my career. I have never 
known a more supportive woman. Yes, it clouded my judgment and, 
yes, I paid the price.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The judge, Col. Kenneth Pangburn, found Guido guilty of  
conspiracy, misappropriating an aircraft and violating an Army 
regulation in the July 6 accident on Grand Exuma Island. 
</P>
<P>
	Guido's wife, Pam, and Rebecca Riddell, the wife of his  
co-pilot, Chief Warrant Officer Daniel Riddell, were killed when 
the UH-60 Blackhawk went down. 
</P>
<P>
	The men, assigned to Hunter Army Airfield in Savannah, were in  
the Bahamas on a drug-fighting mission. 
</P>
<P>
	Guido, of North Haven, Conn., was accused of conspiring with  
Riddell and a technician to sneak his wife and Mrs. Riddell aboard 
the helicopter. 
</P>
<P>
	Guido, a 19 1/2-year Army veteran, was acquitted of a charge of  
conduct unbecoming an officer. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the judge saw the conduct for what it was and I  
appreciate his fairness,'' Guido said after the sentencing, as 
supporters shook hands and wiped away tears of joy. 
</P>
<P>
	Riddell pleaded guilty to wrongful violation of a military order  
and willful dereliction of duty. He still faces charges of 
conspiracy, making a false statement, wrongful appropriation of a 
military aircraft and conduct unbecoming an officer. He is awaiting 
court-martial June 29. 
</P>
<P>
	Sgt. William Westgate, who also was on the flight, was seriously  
injured in the crash. No date has been set for his court-martial. 
</P>
<P>
	During a hearing in March, one investigator testified the  
accident was caused by a ``pitch-back attack,'' a flying maneuver 
that causes the helicopter to abruptly change directions by 
spinning the tail. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense lawyers have said a mechanical failure was to blame and  
that the pilots did nothing dangerous.

<HEADLINE> Dollar Down As Stocks Fall </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The dollar fell broadly Friday as traders got  
skittish watching weak foreign economies start to mend coupled with 
U.S. stocks and bonds falling as inflation prospects increased. 
</P>
<P>
	``With better performances outside of this country and prospects  
for tightening that were hitting the markets ... you saw the dollar 
falling as well,'' said Guillermo Estebanez, a foreign exchange 
economist at the Bank of America in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
	In late New York trading, the dollar was quoted at 118.08  
Japanese yen, down from 118.84 late Thursday. The euro was quoted 
at $1.0535, up from $1.0489. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors have bet on the dollar for months because of the  
strength of the U.S. economy and the weakness of the world's second 
and third largest economies. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan is suffering from its worst recession in 50 years and the  
11 European nations using the euro as their single currency are 
under stress because of double-digit unemployment and other 
economic ills. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet both Japan, the No. 2 economy, and Germany, the third  
largest economy and the economic engine of the European Union, 
received reports this week showing strong gross domestic product 
numbers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Immediately, that gives a better tone for those currencies,''  
Estebanez said. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the Commerce Department reported Friday that retail  
sales rose a strong 1 percent in May, the 10th month of rising or 
steady sales, that made May 1999's retail sales report 7.8 percent 
higher than that of May 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Even though economists note that other U.S. economic data are  
mild, they are concerned that consumer spending could touch off 
inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal Reserve policy-makers are expected to consider raising  
interest rates at their next meeting, June 29-30, to slow the 
economy and fight inflation. They've already said publicly they 
have a bias toward raising rates because of the economy's 
direction. 
</P>
<P>
	While higher interest rates normally help support a country's  
currency, in this case higher rates would be perceived as a signal 
of an economy in trouble. 
</P>
<P>
	Stock and bond markets took all of those hints Friday. The Dow  
Jones industrial average fell 130.76 points to 10,490.51, sinking 
309.33 points, or 2.9 percent, for the week. U.S. Treasurys sold 
off steeply, sending the 30-year bond's yield to 18-month highs. 
</P>
<P>
	In other late trading, the dollar was quoted at 1.5141 Swiss  
francs, down from 1.5225, and 1.4618 Canadian dollars, down from 
1.4624. The British pound rose to $1.6176 from $1.6054. 
</P>
<P>
	Currencies of the 11 countries participating in the euro are no  
longer traded separately and are tied to the euro by a fixed rate. 
Based on the euro's latest exchange rate, the dollar was worth: 
1.8567 German marks, down from 1.8646; 6.2267 French francs, down 
from 6.2539; and 1,838.24 Italian lire, down from 1,845.02.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Prison Guard Settles Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FRESNO, Calif. (AP) -- A former prison guard who claimed he was  
forced to retire after alerting authorities to brutality at a 
California prison has won a $1.7 million settlement from the state. 
</P>
<P>
	The Department of Corrections reached the settlement with  
Richard Caruso on Wednesday, after negotiations that involved Gov. 
Gray Davis. The department did not admit wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
	Caruso, 35, alleged in his lawsuit that prison officials forced  
him out after he and another officer went to the FBI in 1994 with 
evidence of brutality at Corcoran State Prison. 
</P>
<P>
	Caruso presented records surrounding the fatal shooting of  
inmate Preston Tate during a fight, a revelation that led to an 
investigation into violence at all 33 state prisons. 
</P>
<P>
	Caruso was a gun post officer assigned to Corcoran's notorious  
Security Housing Unit. Among his allegations were claims that 
guards staged fights between prisoners. 
</P>
<P>
	``His coming forward opened a Pandora's box to a prison  
subculture that was running amok,'' said Senate Majority Leader 
Richard Polanco, a Democrat.

<HEADLINE> Lawyer Defends IOC's Kim </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- A lawyer for International Olympic  
Committee member Kim Un-yong says an IOC investigator tried to 
strong-arm a businessman into signing a false statement linking 
$20,000 from Salt Lake Olympic bid officials to Kim's son. 
</P>
<P>
	Howard Graff, a lawyer for Kim's family, said Joe Pagani, a  
private investigator hired by the IOC, tried to coerce Ted Kang 
into signing a statement saying he accepted a $20,000 check from 
Salt Lake officials, then wrote one of his own to a company 
employing Kim Un-yong's son, John Kim. 
</P>
<P>
	John Kim and Kang had met at a Korean church. Kang's lawyer,  
Mark Spund, would not comment. 
</P>
<P>
	USA Today quoted Pagani as saying that in earlier interviews  
Kang had admitted writing the check, but balked at signing the 
statement. Pagani said Kang later sent a letter to the IOC saying 
Pagani tried to pressure him for the signature. 
</P>
<P>
	According to SLOC's ethics report issued in February, the bid  
committee wrote a $20,000 check in 1992 for an IOC consulting 
contract. A voucher request for the check said it was to be made 
out to Komar International Inc., owned by John Kim. 
</P>
<P>
	Graff told The Associated Press on Friday that Komar never had a  
deal with the committee. 
</P>
<P>
	At some point, the check was altered, apparently to read ``Kobee  
Inc.,'' a now-defunct New Jersey medical supply company once owned 
by Kang. 
</P>
<P>
	The check appears to have been signed by Tom Welch, former Salt  
Lake bid president, and Craig Peterson, the bid committee's chief 
administrative officer, who also apparently initialed the change 
from Komar to Kobee. 
</P>
<P>
	According to Friday's USA Today, three days after Kang cashed  
the check, he wrote another check for the same amount to Keystone 
Communications, which had hired Kim in 1992 at Welch's behest. 
</P>
<P>
	Kim had been laid off his job with NBC Sports in 1992, and his  
father asked Welch to find his son a job so he could keep his green 
card, according to SLOC's ethics panel. 
</P>
<P>
	Welch arranged the job with Keystone on the condition the bid  
committee pay Kim's salary, which Keystone CEO David Simmons 
estimated at between $75,000 and $100,000. 
</P>
<P>
	The bid committee later agreed to a contract with Keystone to  
use its ``knowledge and access to certain members of the IOC'' to 
help win their support. Two checks totaling $45,000 were 
subsequently issued to Keystone -- one on Sept. 30, 1992, the same 
day as the check to Kobee, and the other seven months later, about 
the time Kim left Keystone. 
</P>
<P>
	Pagani told USA Today that neither Kim nor Kang did any work for  
the Salt Lake bid committee and that Kang told him that he 
deposited the bid committee check and wrote the check to Keystone 
as a favor for Kim. 
</P>
<P>
	Even if the bid committee's money went to Keystone, Graff said  
he had no knowledge that any of it went to John Kim. 
</P>
<P>
	``At the bottom of all this, John Kim never received a plug  
nickel from the bid committee,'' Graff said. ``Mr. Welch tried to 
give him money but he said `no.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Graff said that under a contract between Komar and Keystone, Kim  
was to make three $10,000 payments to Keystone, but Welch made the 
first payment without Kim's knowledge. Kim returned the money to 
Welch through a certified check, Graff said. 
</P>
<P>
	Welch's lawyer was unavailable for comment Friday.  
</P>
<P>
	Kim Un-yong received a severe warning from the IOC's  
investigation of the Salt Lake bribery scandal, but no further 
action was taken. ``The point of view of the IOC is this case is 
closed,'' IOC spokesman Franklin Servan-Schreiber said. 
</P>
<P>
	Kim family spokesman Bill Schechter called the USA Today report  
-- on the eve of an IOC meeting in Kim's hometown of Seoul, South 
Korea -- a ``cheap shot.''

<HEADLINE> Hechinger Co. files for Protection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LARGO, Md. (AP) -- Hechinger Co., the home improvement retailer  
that has been struggling against rivals such as Home Depot, filed 
today for protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of the federal 
bankruptcy law. 
</P>
<P>
	The company will close 89 stores in 36 markets to reduce  
operating losses and focus on a core of healthier stores. The 
closures will leave about 117 stores operating in 21 states. 
</P>
<P>
	Hechinger said it will focus on larger stores and its Home  
Quarters outlets. The company said it will convert its remaining 16 
Builders Square stores to the Home Quarters format. 
</P>
<P>
	The company failed to make a $4.7 million interest payment on  
its unsecured debt May 15 and recently reported a loss of $228 
million for its quarter ended in April 3. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts have said nervous suppliers are cutting back on credit,  
which has only intensified Hechinger's cash crunch. They say the 
retailer is clearly having trouble stocking store shelves during 
the warm months when homeowners are most eager to spend money for 
house and garden improvement projects. 
</P>
<P>
	In a related development, Kmart Corp. said today it will set  
aside $230 million to cover costs stemming from lease guarantees 
resulting from its 1997 sale of the Builders Square chain of stores 
to Hechinger. 
</P>
<P>
	Builders Square was one of four subsidiaries that Kmart sold or  
spun off a few years ago as part of a refocusing on its discount 
retail stores. Under that deal, Kmart said it would guarantee 
leases now worth $1.2 billion, of which $761 million is for 
Builders Square stores. 
</P>
<P>
	Largo, Md.-based Hechinger combined Builders Square with two  
other chains to create the third-largest home-improvement retailer 
behind Home Depot Inc. and Lowe's Cos. 
</P>
<P>
	Since then, Home Depot and Lowe's have added stores and boosted  
profits, while Hechinger has struggled. The company has been 
remodeling stores and shedding others, ending April with 206 
locations. 
</P>
<P>
	Kmart said today that up to 115 former Builder's Square  
locations may become Kmart's responsibility. Chairman Floyd Hall 
said the company would try to sublease most or all of the 
properties. 
</P>
<P>
	``While the precise outcome of the legal process remains to be  
seen, Kmart believes that, in light of the Hechinger's filing, it 
is appropriate to take charge at this time,'' Hall said. 
</P>
<P>
	Founded in 1911, Hechinger opened its first store in Washington,  
D.C., in 1919. The family-owned business grew into a local 
institution and one of the first large-scale home-improvement 
chains in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
	But the retailer is losing shoppers, just as the residential  
real estate and home-improvement markets are booming. 
</P>
<P>
	By the early 1990s, it was clear that the Hechinger family had  
failed to recognize the emerging threat posed by Home Depot and 
Lowe's, which were beginning to dot the countryside with 
superstores. When both rivals entered Hechinger's markets, the 
company lost valuable market share and never managed to win it 
back. 
</P>
<P>
	Hechinger was sold two years ago for $507 million to Leonard  
Green &AMP; Partners, a Los Angeles investment group.

<HEADLINE>  Pope Addresses Polish Parliament </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WARSAW, Poland (AP) -- Pope John Paul II celebrated his  
homeland's decade of freedom today with an unprecedented speech in 
parliament, receiving a hero's welcome from Solidarity and 
ex-communist deputies alike. 
</P>
<P>
	``Oh, look what's happened to us!'' he exclaimed to ``all my  
dear fellow Poles,'' his hands outstretched in a gesture of wonder 
at the peaceful transformation from communism to democracy that his 
papacy helped inspire. 
</P>
<P>
	The packed chamber, including former communist leader Gen.  
Wojciech Jaruzelski and Solidarity founder Lech Walesa, gave him 
lengthy standing ovations and sang the national anthem, followed by 
the traditional ``Sto lat,'' or ``May he live 100 years,'' for the 
country's most beloved figure. 
</P>
<P>
	Even former communists knelt and crossed themselves as John Paul  
walked slowly into the marble-walled chamber to a throne-like chair 
set up just for him. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the first address by the Roman Catholic pontiff to a  
national parliament, and he offered the most political comments so 
far of his 13-day pilgrimage to Poland. 
</P>
<P>
	He gave the Vatican's full endorsement to Poland's efforts to  
join the European Union, a plan drawing growing public opposition 
due to the painful economic reforms necessary to qualify. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, John Paul said politics and economic  
development must be based on ethical principles and spirituality, a 
theme with particular resonance in a country where many people 
equate national identity with Catholicism. 
</P>
<P>
	``As we rejoice together at the positive changes taking place in  
Poland before our eyes, we cannot fail to recognize as well that in 
a free society, there also must be values which guarantee the 
supreme good of man in his totality,'' the pope said. ``Every 
economic change must help to build a world that is more human and 
more just.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the end, he echoed his prayer from his first pilgrimage home  
20 years earlier, when he asked the Holy Spirit to ``renew the 
face'' of Poland. Those words are credited with helping spark the 
birth of Solidarity a year later, leading to the end of communism 
in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
	Stooped and slowed by age and frail health, John Paul spoke  
strongly today, the seventh day of his longest pilgrimage to a 
single country. His sometimes slurred speech and a shaking left 
hand have prompted speculation he may suffer from Parkinson's 
disease -- never confirmed by the Vatican -- but he has handled the 
rigorous schedule so far without problem. 
</P>
<P>
	After his visit to parliament, the pope met briefly with local  
religious leaders. 
</P>
<P>
	Poland's chief rabbi, Pinchas Menachem Joskowicz, asked the pope  
to remove a 26-foot cross from property bordering the former Nazi 
death camp Auschwitz. 
</P>
<P>
	Jews say the cross infringes on the memory of more than 1  
million Jews killed at Auschwitz and the nearby Birkenau camp. 
</P>
<P>
	Joskowicz thanked Polish officials for recently removing 300  
smaller crosses that had been erected near the large cross by 
radical Catholics. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have a favor to ask of Mr. Pope, to call on his people to  
also take this cross out of the camp,'' Joskowicz said. 
</P>
<P>
	John Paul's brief reply was inaudible.  
</P>
<P>
	The Vatican has repeatedly refused to get involved in the  
controversy. 
</P>
<P>
	Later today, the pope will pay tribute to Jewish victims of the  
Holocaust at Umschlagplatz monument in Warsaw, where thousands 
gathered along his route on streets decorated with huge banners and 
Vatican and Polish flags. 
</P>
<P>
	Religious unity has been a constant refrain of the pontiff's  
visit, and John Paul expanded that to call for social unity today. 
In Poland, miners, farmers and others are rebelling against 
widespread economic reforms intended to complete the transition 
from communism and prepare the country to join the European Union. 
</P>
<P>
	While abundant goods and a new geopolitical role in Western  
Europe -- which Poles have always considered their proper 
neighborhood -- represent improvements over the communist era, 
workers feel threatened by the unemployment and uncertainty 
accompanying the reforms. 
</P>
<P>
	``The exercise of political authority, whether in the community  
or in the institutions of the state, ought to be a generous service 
to man and to society, not a pursuit of gain by individuals or 
groups,'' John Paul said to applause.

	It was the first address by the Roman Catholic pontiff to a  
national parliament, and he offered the most political comments so 
far of his 13-day pilgrimage to Poland. 
</P>
<P>
	He gave the Vatican's full endorsement to Poland's efforts to  
join the European Union, a plan drawing growing public opposition 
due to the painful economic reforms necessary to qualify. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, John Paul said politics and economic  
development must be based on ethical principles and spirituality, a 
theme with particular resonance in a country where many people 
equate national identity with Catholicism. 
</P>
<P>
	``As we rejoice together at the positive changes taking place in  
Poland before our eyes, we cannot fail to recognize as well that in 
a free society, there also must be values which guarantee the 
supreme good of man in his totality,'' the pope said. ``Every 
economic change must help to build a world that is more human and 
more just.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the end, he echoed his prayer from his first pilgrimage home  
20 years earlier, when he asked the Holy Spirit to ``renew the 
face'' of Poland. Those words are credited with helping spark the 
birth of Solidarity a year later, leading to the end of communism 
in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
	Stooped and slowed by age and frail health, John Paul spoke  
strongly today, the seventh day of his longest pilgrimage to a 
single country. His sometimes slurred speech and a shaking left 
hand have prompted speculation he may suffer from Parkinson's 
disease -- never confirmed by the Vatican -- but he has handled the 
rigorous schedule so far without problem. 
</P>
<P>
	After his visit to parliament, the pope met briefly with local  
religious leaders. 
</P>
<P>
	Poland's chief rabbi, Pinchas Menachem Joskowicz, asked the pope  
to remove a 26-foot cross from property bordering the former Nazi 
death camp Auschwitz. 
</P>
<P>
	Jews say the cross infringes on the memory of more than 1  
million Jews killed at Auschwitz and the nearby Birkenau camp. 
</P>
<P>
	Joskowicz thanked Polish officials for recently removing 300  
smaller crosses that had been erected near the large cross by 
radical Catholics. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have a favor to ask of Mr. Pope, to call on his people to  
also take this cross out of the camp,'' Joskowicz said. 
</P>
<P>
	John Paul's brief reply was inaudible.  
</P>
<P>
	The Vatican has repeatedly refused to get involved in the  
controversy. 
</P>
<P>
	Later today, the pope will pay tribute to Jewish victims of the  
Holocaust at Umschlagplatz monument in Warsaw, where thousands 
gathered along his route on streets decorated with huge banners and 
Vatican and Polish flags. 
</P>
<P>
	Religious unity has been a constant refrain of the pontiff's  
visit, and John Paul expanded that to call for social unity today. 
In Poland, miners, farmers and others are rebelling against 
widespread economic reforms intended to complete the transition 
from communism and prepare the country to join the European Union. 
</P>
<P>
	While abundant goods and a new geopolitical role in Western  
Europe -- which Poles have always considered their proper 
neighborhood -- represent improvements over the communist era, 
workers feel threatened by the unemployment and uncertainty 
accompanying the reforms. 
</P>
<P>
	``The exercise of political authority, whether in the community  
or in the institutions of the state, ought to be a generous service 
to man and to society, not a pursuit of gain by individuals or 
groups,'' John Paul said to applause.

<HEADLINE> Hackers Attack Senate Web Site </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Computer hackers successfully attacked the  
U.S. Senate's main Web site Friday, the second such electronic 
assault on the high-profile Internet page in just over two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	The hackers hijacked visitors to the site, www.senate.gov, and  
subtly misdirected them to another computer on the Internet with a 
defaced version of the Senate's Web page, said Tom Meenan of the 
Senate's Sergeant at Arms Office, which operates the Senate site. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are trying to identify exactly what the loophole was'' that  
allowed the hackers to redirect visitors to the other computer, 
Meenan said late Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
	The Associated Press traced the computer hosting the false  
Senate site to a real estate company in Jacksonville, Fla. Meenan 
said the FBI was investigating, but noted it was possible that the 
hackers took control of the Florida company's computers without its 
knowledge. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a site they may have hacked elsewhere on the Internet,''  
Meenan said. ``We don't know the details. We've been in touch with 
the FBI.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A telephone message said the offices of the Florida company were  
closed late Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
	The altered site looked similar to the Senate's normal pages.  
For example, it included a link to a ``today in history'' feature 
but substituted news that ``Senator Robert F. Kennedy, D-N.Y., was 
assassinated.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In an obvious taunt directed at the FBI -- which is conducting a  
national crackdown on computer hackers -- they wrote on part of the 
page: ``You can stop one, but you cannot stop all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	They also left messages supporting infamous hacker Kevin  
Mitnick, who will be sentenced Monday in Los Angeles to 46 months 
in prison for computer fraud, and for Eric Burns, 19, who was 
indicted last month in northern Virginia on three counts of 
computer intrusion. 
</P>
<P>
	Meenan said the Senate's computers were fixed about one hour  
after the attack, but the repaired address information for the 
Senate could take days to propagate through the thousands of 
Internet providers worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
	The FBI already was investigating a May 27 attack on the Web  
site, spokeswoman Debbie Weierman said. ``This current (attack), I 
can't give you a reason why it happened.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The FBI made its own Internet site inaccessible last month after  
hackers overwhelmed its Internet computers using a denial of 
service attack, a relatively common technique to overload a site. 
</P>
<P>
	One computer security expert said the second electronic assault  
on the Senate site doesn't inspire confidence in Internet security. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the FBI and the Senate can be so easily hacked, what does  
that say for the nation, in the public and private sectors?'' asked 
James Adams, chief executive officer of Infrastructure Defense 
Inc., which works to protect companies against hackers. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we have at the moment is a quite remarkable lack of  
knowledge about what's out there and how to defend against it,'' 
Adams said. ``Until it's addressed, you're going to see this again 
and again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The hackers in the latest assault on the Senate site claimed to  
belong to the relatively unknown ``Varna Hacking Group.'' The same 
group claimed responsibility in November 1998 for an attack on a 
commercial Web site that had been altered with a plea to ``Please 
help Bulgarian children.'' Varna is a province in Bulgaria. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this month, Deputy Attorney General Eric Holder promised  
that anyone attacking a government Web site ``will be prosecuted in 
a very serious way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We tend to think of these hackers as kind of little cherubs,  
these little 16- and 15-year-olds who are going around fooling 
around with their computers,'' Holder said. ``And the reality is, 
regardless of their age, what they're doing has a very serious 
impact on the ability of these various agencies to get information 
out to the public.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sherry Little, a spokeswoman for the Senate's technical staff,  
said after the May 27 attack that technical experts planned to meet 
with the FBI to put security measures in place. 
</P>
<P>
	An obscene message left briefly on the Senate's Web site May 27  
said that attack was carried out because of what it said was the 
FBI's harassment of specific hacker groups, including the group 
that boasted of earlier breaking into the White House Web site.

<HEADLINE> Motel Body Identified as New Yorker </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. (AP) -- A man whose body was found underneath  
a motel room bed was identified Friday as a New York City resident 
who'd been stabbed to death, authorities said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The body of Saul Hernandez, 64, was found in Room 112 of the  
Burgundy Motor Inn after two German tourists slept overnight in the 
bed despite a rancid smell that prompted them to complain to the 
front desk. 
</P>
<P>
	The couple told motel officials about the smell Wednesday night  
but stayed in the $36-a-night room anyway. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday they were given a new room. A housekeeper lifted up  
the mattress and box spring to find the rotting body inside a 
wooden frame. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators said the victim stayed for two days beginning  
Sunday. He checked out about 6:30 a.m. Tuesday but returned later 
in the morning and insisted that he had the room until noon, asking 
for the key, investigators said. 
</P>
<P>
	He was given the key and returned to the room, but was not seen  
again.

<HEADLINE> NL Ump Cuzzi Gets a Second Chance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Phil Cuzzi did his best to get on with life beyond baseball.  
</P>
<P>
	His career as an aspiring big league umpire over -- it seemed --  
he became a bartender. And a substitute teacher. And he held a few 
other jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	``And there were times when I didn't do anything,'' he said. ``I  
was just so down and so embarrassed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Then, a lucky break.  
</P>
<P>
	Working at the VIP lounge at a hotel in New Jersey in July 1996,  
a chance meeting with NL president Len Coleman led to a unique 
second chance: Cuzzi, out of the game for three seasons, could 
return to the only job he ever wanted if he started over at the 
bottom. 
</P>
<P>
	After a long road through all levels of the minors, Cuzzi will  
be back in the majors for the first time in six years tonight when 
he handles the Baltimore-Atlanta game at Turner Field. 
</P>
<P>
	``From the time I came back, I never felt that it couldn't work  
out,'' the 43-year-old Cuzzi said Thursday. ``But I would say there 
were fleeting times when I wondered, `Will it work out?''' 
</P>
<P>
	``When they called and said I was working this weekend, the  
first thing I did was call my wife and she started crying,'' he 
said. ``And when I hung up the phone, I started crying like a 
baby.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cuzzi is scheduled to work the plate on Sunday night -- Mike  
Mussina vs. John Smoltz on ESPN -- taking the place of Eric Gregg, 
out for the past month because of health reasons. 
</P>
<P>
	After that, Cuzzi heads back to the International League, where  
he's the lowest-paid umpire in Triple-A. Beyond that, nothing is 
certain for the undaunted ump. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know what the future holds,'' said Cuzzi, who had a  
game Thursday night in Norfolk, Va. ``There were no promises, no 
guarantees and no shortcuts when Mr. Coleman made this possible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Said Coleman: ``I could tell he was committed to umpiring. He  
wanted back in, and I thought he deserved another opportunity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	NL crew chief Bruce Froemming was among many championing Cuzzi's  
cause. 
</P>
<P>
	``I knew Phil when he was here the first time. I applaud his  
courage and persistence,'' Froemming said. ``Phil did not want to 
be eliminated. He's like a fighter who gets knocked out a lot of 
times, but keeps getting up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cuzzi began umpiring in 1985 in the New York-Penn League. By  
1991, he was a fill-in for the NL, and he worked a total of 95 
games in the majors in a three-year span. 
</P>
<P>
	Then on the day before Thanksgiving in 1993 came the dreaded  
call. He had done well, but there were no foreseeable spots for him 
in the majors, and he was being released -- seemingly forever. 
</P>
<P>
	Though about a dozen pro umps get dropped each year, ``I  
couldn't believe it,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Cuzzi was working at the Hilton in Short Hills, N.J., in July  
1996 when he heard Coleman was coming. 
</P>
<P>
	Cuzzi happened to have a letter in his pocket that he was  
preparing to send to Coleman. So after finishing his night shift, 
Cuzzi knocked on Coleman's door. 
</P>
<P>
	Coleman was in the shower. Cuzzi said he had a letter to deliver  
but didn't identify himself, and when he came back a half-hour 
later, Coleman was asleep. 
</P>
<P>
	Cuzzi slipped the letter under the door, then found out Coleman  
had a wakeup call at 7 a.m. Cuzzi returned early the next morning. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was pacing in the hall, back and forth in front of his  
room,'' Cuzzi recalled. ``It felt like I was out there forever, but 
it was probably 30 minutes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Eventually, the door opened and they were face-to-face.  
</P>
<P>
	``Initially, I kind of jumped back. It surprised me,'' Coleman  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know if he thought I was a nut or a stalker,'' Cuzzi  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	They talked for about 20 minutes, and Coleman promised he would  
call. Two weeks later, he presented Cuzzi with this option: Work 
one year in Class A, one year in Double-A and one year in Triple-A, 
and then whatever happens, happens. 
</P>
<P>
	Cuzzi spent the 1997 season in the Florida State League, teamed  
with umpires half his age and making $2,000 a month. 
</P>
<P>
	He spent 1998 in the Eastern League and now is in the  
International League. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're part of his journey here,'' IL president Randy Mobley  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Cuzzi got his chance this weekend because all eight fill-in  
umpires the NL employs are working, the result of a stretched staff 
during interleague play. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know there were a lot of people who thought I was crazy for  
pursuing this. But I had the support of my wife, Gilda, and I just 
knew I was meant to be in this game,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think all of this has made me a better umpire,'' he said.  
``And when I get on the field Friday night, I know I will 
appreciate it even more.''

<HEADLINE> Knicks' Johnson Injures Knee </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Larry Johnson of the New York Knicks sprained  
his right knee Friday night during the second quarter of Game 6 in 
the Eastern Conference finals against Indiana. 
</P>
<P>
	The Knicks said Johnson was taken to a hospital for further  
examination and would not return to the game. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson was helped from the court by two teammates and never put  
any weight on the leg. 
</P>
<P>
	Pacers point guard Travis Best had just made a layup in traffic  
when he fell awkwardly and banged into the side of Johnson's knee. 
The forward went down and stayed on the floor under the basket for 
several minutes before being helped off the court. 
</P>
<P>
	He was injured with 6:03 left in the half and the Knicks ahead  
28-26. New York led 41-35 at halftime. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson, the hero of Game 3 for his game-winning four-point  
play, has been the Knicks' leading scorer in the series with an 
average of 18.2 points. He had two 3-pointers late in the fourth 
quarter of Game 5 Wednesday night to help New York take a 3-2 lead 
in the best-of-7 series. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson is one of the few remaining big men on New York's  
roster, and his injury left the Knicks with Chris Dudley, Kurt 
Thomas, Marcus Camby and 41-year-old Herb Williams as their only 
players taller than 6-foot-8. 
</P>
<P>
	Center Patrick Ewing suffered a partial tear of his Achilles'  
tendon in Game 2 and is out for the rest of the season.

<HEADLINE> How Toxic Waste Cleanup Money's Spent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Nearly $6 of every $10 spent on the Superfund  
toxic waste cleanup program goes for support activities and not 
directly to site cleanup, a congressional report said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Environmental Protection Agency disputed the analysis used  
by the General Accounting Office. It said many of the activities 
the GAO called ``support'' actually contribute significantly to 
cleaning the toxic waste sites. 
</P>
<P>
	The Superfund program, begun in 1980, has been under attack for  
years from critics who contend that too much of the money -- both 
taxpayer dollars and funds collected from the oil and chemical 
industries -- have gone for litigation and non-cleanup activities. 
</P>
<P>
	About $1.4 billion a year has been spent by the government on  
Superfund activities in each of the last three years and another $1 
billion has been spent annually by private entities under threat of 
enforcement to remove toxic chemicals from contaminated sites. 
</P>
<P>
	But the GAO said the percentage of taxpayer funds going to  
contractors for direct cleanup work declined in each of the last 
two years. It said in 1998, just over 42 percent of the money went 
to contractors for cleanup activities and the rest for ``support'' 
activities, compared with just under 48 percent in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, about 18 percent went for support activities related  
to specific Superfund sites and nearly 40 percent went to support 
the Superfund program generally, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	``EPA has told Congress that the Superfund program is getting  
better. ... In fact, it's getting worse,'' Rep. Tom Bliley, R-Va., 
who released the report, said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	In a letter accompanying the congressional report, the EPA  
argued that the GAO did not take into account that much of what the 
report calls ``support'' activities -- including lab analysis, 
engineering and technical analysis -- contributes directly to 
cleaning a site of contamination. 
</P>
<P>
	The definition used in the report ``gives the erroneous  
impression that support (activities) do not contribute 
substantially to the achievement of cleanup,'' Timothy Fields, 
EPA's acting assistant administrator, wrote in a formal response. 
</P>
<P>
	He also complained that the GAO analysis ``does not account for  
the estimated $1 billion annually in cleanup expenditures'' by 
private parties under threat of EPA enforcement action. Overall, 70 
percent of the Superfund budget ``will be used for cleanup 
response,'' wrote Fields. 
</P>
<P>
	EPA spokeswoman Kim Rubey said Friday, ``By any measures,  
cleanup is being conducted 20 percent faster and 20 percent cheaper 
than at any other time since Superfund began.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The House Commerce Committee, which Bliley chairs, is  
considering legislation that would overhaul the Superfund program, 
but its prospects this year are slim. A Commerce subcommittee 
approved it this week, 22-9, but the administration and many House 
Democrats oppose some of its provisions.

<HEADLINE> How To Prepare for Fed Rate Hike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- It isn't just Wall Street that's jittery about  
whether Federal Reserve policy-makers will hike interest rates 
later this month to fight inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	Specifically, home buyers have been rushing to lock in mortgage  
rates, still historically low, before they have time to move 
higher. At the same time, home builders are said to be concerned 
about how a change in rates will affect their business, while also 
feeling the pinch of higher prices for construction materials. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is driving people in the market at a very brisk pace,''  
said Dorcas Helfant, who runs Coldwell Banker-Helfant Realty, a 
large residential brokerage firm in Virginia Beach, Va. 
</P>
<P>
	Helfant, also a former president of the National Association of  
Realtors in Washington, reports a sharp increase in buying activity 
during the month of June, with families snapping up homes and 
locking in mortgage rates earlier than usual for this time of year, 
something she believes makes prudent sense during economic 
uncertainty. 
</P>
<P>
	``They don't know what's going to happen in the next couple of  
weeks,'' she said. ``They're getting concerned.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Fed left an unclear picture about interest rates at the  
Federal Open Market Committee meeting on May 18, deciding against 
raising them for the time being but adopting a ``bias'' in favor of 
higher rates if inflation resurfaces. 
</P>
<P>
	Two FOMC meetings are planned for the summer -- June 29-30 and  
Aug. 24. 
</P>
<P>
	Some economic experts think that if the Fed does anything, it  
will be during the latter of the two dates and include only a 
modest upward adjustment in short-term rates. 
</P>
<P>
	They say there have been no clear signs that inflation is, in  
fact, getting out of hand. However, there has been some reason to 
worry, they noted. 
</P>
<P>
	The government reported last month that consumer prices rose  
sharply last spring, and this past week, the Japanese government 
reported a higher-than-expected increase in economic growth, which 
set off fears that Japanese demand for U.S. goods might swell. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a greater chance than not that they'll keep rates  
steady at the next meeting unless there's a big inflation number,'' 
Michael Carliner, an economist for the National Association of Home 
Builders in Washington, said this past week. 
</P>
<P>
	``But clearly the bond market doesn't agree with our  
forecasts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	To be sure, the bond and stock markets have been rattled lately,  
with the Dow Jones industrial average losing nearly 300 points 
since mid-May and the Treasury's 30-year bond now yielding 6.16 
percent as of Friday, its highest level since Nov. 7, 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	As a result, mortgage rates have been heading higher.  
</P>
<P>
	The most recent weekly national survey of rates by Freddie Mac,  
the mortgage company, found 30-year fixed-rate mortgages climbed to 
7.51 percent for the week ending June 11, the highest level in 
nearly two years. 
</P>
<P>
	Rates have been rising for the past two months. Their low for  
the year was 6.74 percent at the end of January. 
</P>
<P>
	That's still historically low, noted Paul Havemann, vice  
president of HSH Associates, a Butler, N.J.-based mortgage research 
firm. Even so, he said, any increase is likely to hurt prospective 
home buyers who may be only marginally qualified for a mortgage. 
</P>
<P>
	``They may not be able to afford a higher rate,'' he said.  
``Every half a percent increase in rates will increase your 
mortgage payment about $50,'' based on a $100,000 mortgage at 
prevailing rates. 
</P>
<P>
	While low rates have helped spur housing sales to record levels  
in recent years, some economists think a slowdown might not be so 
bad for the overall economy right now. 
</P>
<P>
	``The housing market in some areas is pretty much overheated,''  
said Carliner, noting that home builders, while concerned about how 
higher rates will impact their business, have seen an increase in 
the cost of construction materials in recent months. 
</P>
<P>
	``A little bit of a slowdown probably won't be such a bad thing  
(to curb inflation).'' 
</P>
<P>
	Higher rates will help stem inflation by raising borrowing  
costs, which can ultimately hurt corporate profits. 
</P>
<P>
	All eyes on both Main Street and Wall Street will likely be on  
the next Consumer Price Index for the month of May, which will be 
released on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The most recent CPI index, which measures inflation on the  
consumer level, showed a 0.7 percent rise during the month of 
April, the biggest jump in about nine years. That put the inflation 
rate at 3.3 percent, vs. a 1.6 percent rate for all of 1998.

<HEADLINE> House Bill Sex Provision Criticized </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Already the focus of a fierce debate over gun  
control, legislation designed to deal with youth violence also is 
touching off controversy over a provision to restrict access to 
sexually explicit material. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Mark Foley, R-Fla., a conservative, suggested Thursday that  
as drafted, the legislation could prevent minors from reading or 
seeing Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr's formal report on 
President Clinton's White House liaisons with Monica Lewinsky. 
</P>
<P>
	``On first blush, no one's for violence. No one's for obscenity.  
It's motherhood and apple pie,'' he said. Yet, he added, ``some of 
the very people who advocate the Second Amendment have a bigger 
eraser for the First.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The First Amendment protects freedom of speech. The Second  
Amendment protects the right of the people to keep and bear arms, 
and figures prominently in the fierce debate over gun control. 
</P>
<P>
	Crafted as a response to the Littleton, Colo., high school  
shootings in April, the legislation is designed to demonstrate that 
``we are not impotent in the face of cultural pollution,'' said its 
author, Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill is expected to reach the House floor next week as part  
of a broader debate that also will extend to gun control and 
measures to crack down on juvenile crime. 
</P>
<P>
	Hyde, chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, told reporters  
recently he recognizes his proposal is ``very controversial'' and 
certain to be subjected to constitutional challenge if it becomes 
law. 
</P>
<P>
	In a measure of that controversy, even before he formally  
introduced his bill earlier this week, Hyde dropped one draft 
provision in response to an appeal by a fellow Republican lawmaker. 
It would have required Internet Web site providers to place a 
notice on their sites detailing their policy on collecting personal 
information and selling it to outside vendors. 
</P>
<P>
	The goal was to preclude pornographers from sending unsolicited  
invitations to individuals to visit their sites. 
</P>
<P>
	And GOP sources who spoke on condition of anonymity said it was  
possible Hyde would curtail or jettison a requirement in the bill 
for the music industry to provide retail outlets with a copy of 
song lyrics for review by parents. These sources said the song 
lyrics provision may be supplanted by a requirement for a study of 
the impact of violent songs on youth behavior. 
</P>
<P>
	The centerpiece of the legislation would restrict sexually  
explicit or violent material from being made available to minors, 
much as current law shelters them from obscene material. 
</P>
<P>
	It applies to pictures, photographs, drawings, sculptures, video  
games, films, and written materials, as well as sound recordings. 
</P>
<P>
	The American Civil Liberties Union opposes the proposal. ``We're  
really concerned about extending the obscenity exception to 
violence,'' said Terri Schroder, an analyst with the organization. 
``Museums, libraries, schools, all sorts of institutions could 
really be in jeopardy,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It ignores the Constitution with vague, meandering definitions  
that will be struck down by the first court that considers it,'' 
said Jack Valenti, who represents the film industry as president of 
the Motion Picture Association of America. ``Home, church and 
school is where the child is taught that violence is wrong. The 
fact that only a tiny fragment of teen-agers is involved in serious 
crime is evidence that most kids are getting it right because they 
have been taught right.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The White House and gun control advocates renewed their attack  
during the day on Hyde's proposed gun provisions. 
</P>
<P>
	``My Republican constituency wants commonsense gun control  
legislation,'' said Rep. Christopher Shays, R-Conn. ``My Republican 
constituency wants the marriage between the Republican Party and 
the NRA to end.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The National Rifle Association historically has opposed gun  
control, and has been lobbying to prevent House passage of a 
provision to expand requirements for instant background checks at 
gun shows. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, critics of Hyde's bill continued to claim it  
would significantly weaken legislation that passed the Senate last 
month, and Hyde hinted he was considering changes. He referred to 
his measure as a ``work in progress.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Material prepared by Democrats on the House Judiciary Committee  
said the bill contained numerous provisions that would allow some 
sales at gun shows to escape the requirement for instant background 
checks. 
</P>
<P>
	The legislation also would allow dealers to ship guns directly  
to unlicensed buyers across state lines, a practice now banned, the 
Democrats said.

<HEADLINE> Man Opens Fire in Michigan, 3 Dead </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SOUTHFIELD, Mich. (AP) -- A gunman opened fire on his former  
psychiatrist Friday, killing the doctor and another person before 
fatally shooting himself, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	Four other people were wounded in the shooting at the office of  
Dr. Reuven Bar-Levav, who died at his office on the 12th floor of 
an office building in this Detroit suburb. 
</P>
<P>
	The name of the gunman -- and the third victim slain, a woman  
from the Detroit area -- was being withheld. 
</P>
<P>
	``It appears we've got a doctor-patient relationship,'' Police  
Chief Joseph Thomas said. ``We are still trying to determine why it 
happened.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Southfield police Detective Darrel Palmer said it was believed  
the gunman was a former patient of Bar-Levav and that the shooting 
happened during ``some sort of meeting.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The victim's daughter, Dr. Leora Bar-Levav, a psychiatrist who  
practiced with her father, said the gunman was no longer a patient. 
</P>
<P>
	``He'd been seen very briefly last year,'' Leora Bar-Levav said  
from her home in Franklin. She declined to answer further 
questions. 
</P>
<P>
	Four victims were taken to a hospital. A man was in serious  
condition with a gunshot wound to the chest, and three other 
victims were being treated for less serious wounds they received 
after being shot at close range, Dr. Peter Goodman said. 
</P>
<P>
	The building -- an office complex with at least two dozen floors  
-- was evacuated of its visitors and workers. 
</P>
<P>
	Bar-Levav, a medical doctor and psychiatrist who shifted his  
practice to Southfield from Detroit a few years ago, has written at 
least two self-published books, the last a 1995 effort titled 
``Every Family Needs a CEO.'' Bar-Levav's other book is ``Sinking 
in the Shadow of Feeling.'' 
</P>
<P>
	According to the jacket of his 1995 book, Bar-Levav was born in  
1927 in Berlin, fled Nazi Germany with his family seven years later 
and went to what now is Israel.

<HEADLINE> Garden Nightmare Sends Pacers Home </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The Indiana Pacers are going to have to put  
their championship mission on hold again. They've got to be getting 
tired of that by now. 
</P>
<P>
	Thought to be the team to beat in this post-Michael Jordan,  
lockout-shortened season, the Pacers were thwarted again Friday 
night with a 90-82 loss to the New York Knicks that might surpass 
the crushing devastation that Jordan and the Bulls inflicted on 
them last year. 
</P>
<P>
	In the '90s, the Pacers have all the pride, experience and  
show-stopping qualities needed for thrilling postseason runs. In 
short, they have everything but rings; in fact, not even a trip to 
the NBA Finals. 
</P>
<P>
	Facing elimination at Madison Square Garden, the Pacers were  
whistled into oblivion as Miller had only eight points to go with 
five fouls. Rik Smits fouled out with 20 points, and Mark Jackson 
committed five personals and scored 14 points. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pacers completed their Garden nightmare with 27 turnovers  
resulting in 26 points by the Knicks. As a result, the Pacers are 
0-4 in the Eastern Conference finals during their impressive but 
still undecorated run of success this decade. 
</P>
<P>
	When they lost to the Bulls in seven games in the conference  
finals last summer, the Pacers vowed to carry Jordan's torch and 
win the first championship after his retirement. They practiced 
together during the lockout, reminded themselves all season that 
nothing less than a championship would do. 
</P>
<P>
	They are right back where they started. This time, it was the  
Knicks showing them the way back to Indiana -- for the third time in 
five playoff series between the rivals. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pacers' nerves never frayed, their determination didn't  
falter even when Miller picked up his third and fourth fouls in a 
span of 13 seconds with less than five minutes left in the third. 
With Miller on the bench, Jalen Rose took his customary spot in 
Spike Lee's corner of the Garden, the 31st Street and Seventh 
Avenue corner, to hit several clutch shots that kept them in the 
game. 
</P>
<P>
	Miller picked up those two crucial fouls while trying -- and  
failing -- to guard New York's Allan Houston, who had 32 points. 
Then, when New York took a four-point lead, and then a six-point 
lead down the stretch, Miller missed the kind of backbreaking shots 
he's come to personify in this building. 
</P>
<P>
	The last miss came with the clock ticking inside 30 seconds.  
</P>
<P>
	Now, start the clock on the Pacers' offseason.

<HEADLINE> Man Convicted in Big Pyramid Scheme </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- In what prosecutors called the biggest pyramid  
scheme in U.S. history, a businessman was convicted of cheating 
22,000 investors across the country out of $700 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Patrick Bennett and his wife sobbed after a federal jury found  
him guilty Thursday of 42 counts, including securities fraud and 
laundering more than $1 billion. The jury did not reach a verdict 
on 11 counts, including the most serious charge of conspiracy. 
</P>
<P>
	Bennett, 46, was held on no bail and faces at least 20 years in  
prison at his Sept. 13 sentencing. 
</P>
<P>
	``Clearly this trial has showed that Patrick R. Bennett is a  
total amoral individual who engaged in any criminal conduct that 
benefits him in any way,'' U.S. District Judge John Martin Jr. 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Martin said the evidence showed Bennett ``has absolutely no  
respect for any law of any kind.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors said the Bennett Funding Group enticed people in 46  
states to invest in office equipment leases that did not exist. 
</P>
<P>
	Bennett pocketed more than $13 million for himself, buying a  
racetrack near Syracuse and spending lavishly on gambling ventures, 
including $19 million for a gambling barge. He put the rest of the 
money into a variety of business ventures, some of which went 
bankrupt. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense lawyers maintained Bennett was overwhelmed by a mountain  
of confusing financing and was not running a massive pyramid scheme 
in which early investors are paid with money from newer investors. 
</P>
<P>
	Bennett's case spanned two trials. In the first, a jury  
convicted Bennett of perjury and obstructing a federal 
investigation of his company, but could not reach a verdict on the 
rest of the charges. 
</P>
<P>
	He admitted he lied to the Securities and Exchange Commission  
after the agency began investigating his company in 1993. 
Prosecutors said those lies stalled the SEC until 1996, causing 
investors to lose hundreds of millions of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
	``This scheme was particularly egregious because it victimized  
thousands of investors who believed the investments were among the 
most secure available in our securities markets,'' U.S. Attorney 
Mary Jo White said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bennett's brother, Michael Bennett, and seven other people have  
pleaded guilty to criminal charges in the case.

<HEADLINE> Home Improvement Chain Files Ch. 11 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LARGO, Md. (AP) -- Hechinger Co., the home improvement chain that  
has struggled against rivals Home Depot Inc. and Lowe's Cos., plans 
to close 89 stores under a Chapter 11 reorganization plan filed 
Friday with U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Delaware. 
</P>
<P>
	The Largo-based retailer said it will focus on a core of 117  
healthier stores in 21 states. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the big victims was Kmart Corp., which sold its Builders  
Square chain two years ago to a venture that was combined with 
Hechinger. 
</P>
<P>
	Separately, Kmart said Friday it was reducing its earnings by  
about $230 million after taxes because it had guaranteed the 
Builders Square leases. It said that up to 115 former Builders 
Square locations may become Kmart's responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
	Hechinger said it will concentrate on larger Hechinger stores  
and its HQ-Home Quarters Warehouse outlets; the vast majority of 
the planned store closing are Builders Square stores. The company 
also plans to convert its remaining Builders Square stores to the 
Home Quarters format, under the Chapter 11 filing, which is subject 
to Bankruptcy Court approval. 
</P>
<P>
	``Filing for Chapter 11 and closing these unprofitable locations  
is the crucial first step in our efforts to remake Hechinger,'' 
said chairman Mark Adams. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts have said nervous suppliers are cutting back credit,  
intensifying Hechinger's cash problems. The credit problems come at 
a bad time for Hechinger, which is having trouble stocking store 
shelves just as homeowners are most eager to spend money for home 
and garden improvements, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
	Kenneth M. Gassman Jr., an analyst with Davenport &AMP; Co. in  
Richmond, Va., predicted that the reorganization would give 
Hechinger three years of life. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're getting to the point where they're not going to be  
able to compete successfully,'' Gassman said. ``I think they'll 
implode further.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hechinger listed $1.3 billion in assets with liabilities  
totaling $1.4 billion. Those liabilities included $323 million in 
bond debt. The company said it would also seek up to $700 million 
in financing from BankBoston Retain Finance Inc. to continue normal 
business operations during reorganization. 
</P>
<P>
	The company failed to make a $4.7 million interest payment on  
its unsecured debt May 15 and reported a loss of $228 million for 
the quarter ending April 3. 
</P>
<P>
	Builders Square was one of four subsidiaries that Kmart sold or  
spun off as part of a plan to refocus on its discount retail 
stores. Under that deal, Kmart said it would guarantee leases now 
worth $1.2 billion, of which $761 million is for Builders Square 
stores. 
</P>
<P>
	Scott Campbell, an analyst for Detroit-based Roney &AMP; Co., said  
the deal would not hurt Kmart badly, noting many of the stores are 
in desirable locations with spaces large enough to lure warehouse 
retailers such as Sam's Club or Costco. 
</P>
<P>
	``The (retailers) would love to get these spaces,'' Campbell  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Kmart stock dipped 6 1/4 cents Friday to close at $14.87 1/2 a share  
on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Founded in 1911, Hechinger grew into a Washington, D.C.  
institution and one of the first large-scale home-improvement 
chains in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
	By the early 1990s, however, it was clear that the Hechinger  
family had failed to recognize the threat posed by Home Depot and 
Lowe's, which were beginning to dot the suburbs with superstores. 
</P>
<P>
	Hechinger was sold two years ago for $507 million to Leonard  
Green &AMP; Partners, a Los Angeles investment group. At the same time, 
Hechinger combined Builders Square with two other chains to create 
the third-largest home-improvement retailer behind its two rivals. 
</P>
<P>
	Since then, Home Depot and Lowe's have added stores and boosted  
profits, while Hechinger has struggled. The company has remodeled 
stores while closing others and had 206 locations in May. 
</P>
<P>
	Gassman said Hechinger erred by not building more large stores  
in far-flung, developing suburbs and by concentrating on 
established locations closer to big cities, which suffered from 
suburban sprawl. 
</P>
<P>
	Many Hechinger outlets also suffer from undersized  
lawn-and-garden centers, narrow, poorly lit aisles, disorganized 
stock and employees that aren't knowledgeable about the company's 
products, Gassman added. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think Hechinger did not listen closely enough to their  
customers,'' Gassman said. ``Those are the kinds of things that 
turn people off.''

<P>
	PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- An armored Russian column rolled  
into the Kosovo capital of Pristina to the cheers of crowds early 
Saturday, as NATO massed its own peacekeeping troops along the 
border apparently set to enter at dawn. There was shouting and 
fireworks as thousands of people crowded the main street of the 
city to greet the Russian soldiers, who arrived aboard trucks and 
troop transports. British and French NATO troops waited in

Slobodan Milosevic and the Serbs have given up control of Kosovo.

	NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- The U.S. Conference of Mayors is urging House  
Speaker Dennis Hastert to press for swift passage of legislation 
requiring higher age restrictions for all firearms buyers and 
background checks for all customers at gun shows. The mayors' 
proposal is more stringent than pending House legislation. Their 
plan includes raising the legal age of gun buyers from 18 to 21 and 
limiting purchases to one gun a month.

	Economy Not Helping Smaller Cities  
</P>
<P>
	NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- The government's third annual ``State of  
Cities'' report says smaller American communities are not sharing 
in the economic boom enjoyed by mega-cities like New York and Los 
Angeles. Smaller and medium-sized cities are experiencing slower 
population growth, higher unemployment and growing poverty compared 
to larger communities, said Andrew Cuomo, secretary of the 
Department of Housing and Urban Development. The report was issued 
here in advance of the 67th annual Conference of Mayors.

	Vatican, Lutherans End Dispute  
</P>
<P>
	GENEVA (AP) -- The Roman Catholic and Lutheran churches have  
ended a nearly 5-century-old dispute over how people achieve 
salvation, officials announced today. The accord represents ``a 
decisive step forward in the process of reconciliation,'' said Rev. 
Ismael Noko, general secretary of the Lutheran World Federation. 
The two sides crafted a compromise on ``justification,'' or how 
humankind achieves salvation. For the Lutherans, salvation depends 
on the grace of God, while Catholics maintain that good works are 
also involved. The declaration states that divine forgiveness comes 
``solely by God's grace'' and that good works flow from that.

	Computer Crash Halts eBay Auctions

	SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- eBay, the online auction site, crashed  
this morning, suspending all bidding on the site. The so-called 
``personal trading community'' with more than 3 million users in 50 
countries was in limbo as the company struggled to rebuild a 
corrupted computer server. The halt, which came after eBay tried to 
launch a revamped version of its site, disrupted bidding on 
millions of collectibles and curios, from military medals to 
mandolins. Bidding was stopped last night and is not expected to 
start up again until this afternoon.

<HEADLINE> Fla. Congresswoman Investigated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The House ethics committee on Friday announced  
an investigation into ties between Rep. Corrine Brown, D-Fla., and 
a wealthy West African businessman convicted of trying to bribe a 
customs agent. 
</P>
<P>
	The committee will look into the businessman's gift of a $50,000  
Lexus automobile to Brown's daughter in 1997, the panel said in a 
statement. 
</P>
<P>
	It said it will also investigate ``lodging provided in 1997'' to  
Brown by the businessman, Foutanga Dit Babani Sissoko. An 
investigative subcommittee, to be headed by Rep. Dave Camp, 
R-Mich., was named to conduct a formal inquiry. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, the committee said it was dropping a variety  
of ``other issues'' that it had been investigating. It did not 
elaborate, but they apparently included Brown's acceptance of a 
$10,000 check from an indicted church leader and allegations of 
improper employment practices. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown, of Jacksonville, said in a statement late Friday that she  
was pleased the panel had dropped those ``groundless suggestions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Now, with the organization of the subcommittee to examine the  
only two remaining allegations, I can look forward to the 
resolution at long last of this whole matter,'' she said in the 
statement. ``I am confident that these charges, like so many others 
dismissed today, will also be finally put to rest.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The ethics committee said it wanted to determine ``the  
relationship, if any, between the lodging or car and Rep. Brown's 
status or actions as a member of Congress.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Federal laws prohibit members of Congress from receiving gifts  
in return for an official act. 
</P>
<P>
	Sissoko pleaded guilty in January 1997 to making a $30,000  
payoff to a U.S. Customs Service agent to improperly export two 
helicopters and was sentenced to a four-month prison term and house 
arrest. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown, 52, whose nine-county district runs from Jacksonville to  
Orlando, wrote two letters to Attorney General Janet Reno, lobbied 
colleagues in Congress and met with foreign diplomats on behalf of 
Sissoko. She later visited him in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	She allegedly stayed in a luxurious high rise condominium near  
Miami while trying to keep Sissoko out of prison.

<HEADLINE> Aerospace Firms Seek Air Show Boost </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PARIS (AP) -- Fallout from the conflict in Yugoslavia and a drop  
in demand for commercial airliners have cast a shadow over the 
prospects of aerospace companies participating in the world's 
biggest air show, which opens Saturday near Paris. 
</P>
<P>
	Business for suppliers of fighter jets could suffer because  
Western governments face steep bills for their military involvement 
in the Balkans and may have less cash to upgrade air forces. 
</P>
<P>
	``My worry is that ultimately the whole Kosovo thing could kill  
the `peace dividend,' '' said Sash Tusa, a defense industry analyst 
with Goldman Sachs in London. 
</P>
<P>
	But companies are competing for expected replacement orders for  
bombs and missiles used in the conflict as well as spare parts for 
the fighters that flew thousands of sorties over Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	The battle for commercial aircraft business also is  
intensifying. Sales of civilian aircraft appear to have peaked, 
with the world's main builders of large passenger planes -- Boeing 
Co. and Europe's Airbus Industrie -- struggling to match last year's 
record of 1,200 airliners sold. 
</P>
<P>
	Amid this uncertainty, the Paris Air Show at Le Bourget airport  
north of the French capital will offer aviation companies one of 
their best opportunities to impress potential customers. 
</P>
<P>
	The event has attracted 1,765 exhibitors from 40 countries.  
French President Jacques Chirac is to inaugurate it, underscoring 
the aerospace industry's strategic and political significance. 
</P>
<P>
	The show, held every other year, will be an occasion for some  
companies to announce new contracts. Lockheed Martin Corp. of 
Bethesda, Md., even jumped the gun, announcing Thursday that it has 
awarded contracts worth $200 million to British suppliers of parts 
used in its C-130J Hercules heavy transport. 
</P>
<P>
	However, sales of aircraft and aviation equipment are normally  
completed after lengthy negotiations, and the weeklong show is less 
a place for participants to strike deals than to show off. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the potential crowd-pleasers: ergonomic pilot seats,  
rocket propulsion systems, unmanned surveillance aircraft and a 
device billed as the world's first miniature airborne VCR. 
</P>
<P>
	Seattle-based Boeing will hold flight demonstrations of its new  
100-seat aircraft, the 717-200, and visitors can see the 
Eurofighter, a jet built by a four-nation European consortium. 
</P>
<P>
	At stake are shares in an increasingly competitive industry.  
</P>
<P>
	``The export market is looking pretty dodgy as far as I can  
see,'' said Sanjay Jha, an analyst with the London-based brokerage 
Williams de Broe. 
</P>
<P>
	Demand for civilian aircraft is slackening in Europe and North  
America. The effects of financial crises continue to linger in East 
Asia, where air travel is just beginning to return to levels seen 
three years ago, and low oil prices have sapped the purchasing 
power of buyers in the Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
	``It appears that we may have reached a peak in the order cycle  
in 1998,'' said Dick James, head of Boeing's operations in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	Boeing plans to deliver 620 planes to customers this year but  
only 480 in 2000, a decrease of 23 percent. James said he expects 
the slackening in global demand to persist until 2002, further 
pinching the company's profit margins after the past two ``very 
difficult'' years. 
</P>
<P>
	Boeing had a loss of $178 million in 1997 and earnings were  
depressed in 1998. It has acknowledged that it is wasting billions 
of dollars on unprofitable businesses, which are under review. But 
profit surged in the first quarter of this year. 
</P>
<P>
	The market for military planes and equipment is tough as well,  
but for different reasons. 
</P>
<P>
	Western governments were just starting to place their first  
major aircraft orders since the Cold War when NATO bombers took to 
the air over Yugoslavia, causing a significant drain on spare parts 
and munitions. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every missile that's been fired has to be replaced,'' said  
Zafar Khan an aerospace analyst in London with the French bank 
Societe Generale. 
</P>
<P>
	One business that stands to benefit is Raytheon Co. of  
Lexington, Mass., maker of Tomahawk cruise missiles. Raytheon said 
last week that it expects to sell $1 billion in cruise missiles and 
other munitions as a direct result of the Kosovo conflict. 
</P>
<P>
	Producers of laser-guided bombs and other so-called ``smart''  
weapons also are likely to get a boost, and the 78 straight days of 
sorties flown by NATO jets suggest that alliance members will be 
spending large sums on maintenance work and engine overhauls. 
</P>
<P>
	As a result of these expenses, however, analysts say that  
tightfisted Western governments are unlikely to order lots of new 
planes. 
</P>
<P>
	Countries in Asia, Africa and Latin America look equally  
reluctant to splurge. 
</P>
<P>
	``None of these countries is awash in cash,'' said Jha, the  
analyst at Williams de Broe. ``The issue is, what is the threat? 
There are more pressing issues.''

<HEADLINE> Hillary Clinton boosts Gephardt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Hillary Rodham Clinton hasn't decided whether  
she wants to join Congress next year, but she left no doubt Friday 
about her choice to lead it. 
</P>
<P>
	The first lady spoke at a fund-raiser on behalf of House  
Minority Leader Dick Gephardt, heir to the speaker's chair if 
Democrats gain six more seats in November 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton didn't mention her possible interest in the vacant  
U.S. Senate seat in New York, and Gephardt only hinted at it. 
</P>
<P>
	``Whatever she does, she will make a mark,'' said Gephardt, who  
is in his 12th congressional term representing St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
	The event coincided with a fundraiser in west St. Louis County  
for Texas Gov. George W. Bush, a leading candidate for the 
Republican presidential nod. While both dinners were by invitation 
only, the Bush event also excluded the media. 
</P>
<P>
	Some contributors spent $1,000 each to see Bush earlier in the  
evening at a private estate and then hurried downtown to the 
America's Center to pay the same price for the Gephardt rally. 
</P>
<P>
	If the crowd at the Gephardt event was bipartisan, it didn't  
sound like it. There were cheers every time the term ``Speaker 
Gephardt'' came up and hisses when a video showed former Republican 
Speaker Newt Gingrich. 
</P>
<P>
	Gephardt staff members said the event, which featured a  
30-minute concert by singer Natalie Cole, set a state record by 
raising more than $2 million. 
</P>
<P>
	About half of that money will go to Gephardt's re-election  
campaign, and half will go to other Democratic candidates. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton's speech was brief but full of praise for Gephardt  
and assurances that Missouri would benefit from having a Democratic 
speaker represent the state in Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's what sets him apart from a lot of people in Washington  
who seem to get where they're going but then forget where they've 
come from,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gephardt called for lawmakers to ``stop destroying one  
another.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to have a new politics in your House of  
Representatives, of trust and decency and idealism, which is what 
we need in this country again,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bill Federer, Gephardt's Republican challenger in 1998 and  
likely challenger next year, said the congressman shouldn't forget 
he has to stay in the House in order to become speaker. 
</P>
<P>
	Gephardt received only 55 percent of the vote against Federer  
last time despite far outspending him. 
</P>
<P>
	``This fund-raiser is a sign Gephardt knows he's going to need  
all the money he can get because I'm going to be like a bulldog 
after him,'' Federer said in a phone interview.

<HEADLINE> USOC Displays FloJo Memorabilia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo. (AP) -- Eight-year-old Mary Ruth Joyner,  
her long black hair neatly braided, clutched her stuffed bear 
``Ted'' and watched intently as her mom settled into the starting 
blocks. 
</P>
<P>
	Florence Griffith Joyner was about to dazzle the world again  
with her speed, style and grace. 
</P>
<P>
	The video footage of ``FloJo'' winning three gold medals in the  
1988 Olympic Games is part of a tribute to Florence Griffith Joyner 
that went on display Friday night at the U.S. Olympic Training 
Center. 
</P>
<P>
	Joyner died last Sept. 21 at age 38 when she was stricken with a  
seizure as she slept at her home in Mission Viejo, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's always hard for me to sometimes see Florence run again  
and know that she's still has the family record,'' her husband, Al 
Joyner, said. ``I'm going to try to get it back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Al Joyner played an important part in the tribute, donating the  
art kit that FloJo used to decorate her long, dazzling fingernails. 
Also on display is the hand torch she carried in the '88 Games in 
Seoul, South Korea, and an action figure depicting her as she 
bolted from the starting blocks. 
</P>
<P>
	The company that makes the figures, Starting Lineup, sent the  
model to FloJo because she wanted to paint it herself to ensure the 
skin tone, hair color, white shoes and red uniform were just right. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wish she was here to see it,'' Joyner said as he walked  
among the poster-sized pictures and glass displays. ``She probably 
would have wanted more fingernail shots.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Since her death, several tributes have been paid to Joyner, who  
still holds world records for the 100 and 200 meters, but Al Joyner 
said the U.S. Olympic Training Center has special meaning for the 
family. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is where dreams start,'' he said, ``but this is also  
where they continue to live. You know what it feels like to train, 
but when somebody else thinks you deserve it, that's the highest 
honor they can bestow on you. You can't train for that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The display will be open to the public at the U.S. Olympic  
Visitor Center until Aug. 13. It includes clothing that FloJo 
designed as well as books she wrote and the U.S. team ring she 
received in Seoul. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wanted it to be colorful and lively -- just like she was as a  
person,'' said Erica Hutchinson, who arranged the display. ``Al 
said he enjoyed it. That's what means the most to me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Olympic Committee president Bill Hybl called the tribute  
one of the proudest moments in his two terms. 
</P>
<P>
	``Not only do we admire her, but we really see a person who has  
made a difference in the lives of young women and young men who are 
looking for direction,'' Hybl said. ``Her impact goes on.''

<HEADLINE> Author Pleads Guilty in Bomb Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) -- An author pleaded guilty to sending his  
book about Oklahoma City bombing conspiracy theories to a member of 
a grand jury that investigated the blast and received a suspended 
sentence and community service on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	David Hoffman, 38, pleaded guilty to two misdemeanor counts of  
tampering with the grand jury, but maintained he was trying to show 
the jury the truth. 
</P>
<P>
	``They've sentenced me to community service, but I think I've  
done the greatest community service a person could do,'' Hoffman 
said. ``I was trying to influence the jury to the truth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hoffman avoided jail time, receiving a one-year suspended  
sentence on each count and one year of probation. He must also 
serve 200 hours of community service. 
</P>
<P>
	Hoffman, author of ``The Oklahoma City Bombing and The Politics  
of Terror,'' is accused of sending a copy of his book and a note to 
an alternate member of the grand jury in September. 
</P>
<P>
	The grand jury met for 18 months. In its final report, it  
dismissed theories that alleged a larger conspiracy and a 
government coverup, including theories mentioned in Hoffman's book.

<HEADLINE> Goodyear Delays Brazil Plant </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) -- The American tire manufacturer Goodyear  
said Friday it would suspend construction of a $180 million factory 
in southern Brazil because of a drop in tire sales amid the 
country's recession. 
</P>
<P>
	Construction of the plant began four months ago in the state of  
Rio Grande do Sul, 500 miles southwest of Sao Paulo. It had been 
scheduled to begin producing 1.5 million tires a month in 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	Luiz Carlos Martins, Goodyear's corporate affairs director, said  
the company would review its decision in two years, adding: ``If 
the market has improved, the factory will be built.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, Goodyear sales dropped 27 percent, going from 37,000  
tires a day to 27,000, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Martins said the suspension had nothing to do with Ford's recent  
decision to halt construction of a factory in the same state. In 
late April, Ford scuttled its plans to build a $1 billion plant 
that was to have begun producing 120,000 cars a year in 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	Goodyear has two plants in Sao Paulo state, where it produces  
tires and other rubber products such as conveyor belts and hoses.

<HEADLINE> Knicks Coach Reaps Millions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Jeff Van Gundy made millions when the New York  
Knicks made it to the NBA Finals on Friday night with a 90-82 
victory over the Indiana Pacers. 
</P>
<P>
	An option year in Van Gundy's contract worth $3.5 million became  
guaranteed when he led his team out of the Eastern Conference 
finals. He also will reportedly receive a $500,000 bonus. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't really care what's in there, I just want to win,'' Van  
Gundy said Friday after the Knicks held their shootaround in 
preparation for Game 6 against the Pacers. 
</P>
<P>
	Van Gundy's potential windfall headlined the front page of one  
of the city's tabloids Friday along with a rare photo of Van Gundy 
smiling. 
</P>
<P>
	The dour-faced coach, in his fourth season running the team, is  
currently making $2 million per season -- the same amount Doc Rivers 
will be getting from Orlando next season despite never having 
coached at any level. 
</P>
<P>
	Van Gundy said he wasn't exactly sure what's in his contract  
because he keeps it in a safety deposit box. 
</P>
<P>
	``The one thing about this job is, I'm fine (financially).  
Wanting to win has zero to do with money,'' Van Gundy said. ``You 
can't buy your way into something that's worthwhile, and the only 
thing worthwhile out of here is trying to be the best team for one 
year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Despite his team's postseason success, Van Gundy has not  
received a vote of confidence from Madison Square Garden 
management. 
</P>
<P>
	Garden president Dave Checketts, who demoted general manager  
Ernie Grunfeld in April because of a rift between the GM and coach, 
has steadfastly insisted that all team personnel, including the 
coach, will have their performances reviewed at the end of the 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	Checketts met with former Chicago Bulls coach Phil Jackson in  
April when the Knicks were 21-21 and in jeopardy of missing the 
playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	Checketts subsequently lied to Van Gundy by denying such a  
meeting ever took place, then met with the coach during the 
second-round series against Atlanta and apologized. 
</P>
<P>
	Speculation about whether Van Gundy would even want to return to  
the Knicks has been rampant ever since. For the past two weeks, Van 
Gundy has brushed aside all queries about his job status. 
</P>
<P>
	Van Gundy became a risk-taker in the Eastern Conference finals.  
He tinkered with his starting lineup before Game 4 by inserting 
Latrell Sprewell and removing Kurt Thomas. And in Game 5, he 
curiously kept Marcus Camby on the bench for the first 10 minutes 
of the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	``By starting Latrell, it was neither genius ... nor stupidity  
in Game 4,'' Van Gundy said. ``It was what I felt was in the best 
interest of the team. That's how I make every decision.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Van Gundy took a lot of criticism when the Sprewell move seemed  
to backfire in Game 4. But those same critics were lauding the move 
after Game 5 when Sprewell unleashed an array of offensive moves 
and had his best game of the series with 29 points. 
</P>
<P>
	With Camby, the coach decided to keep him out for the bulk of  
the third quarter because he had three fouls. He wanted Camby 
available for the entire fourth quarter, and he didn't want him 
playing tentatively because of foul trouble. 
</P>
<P>
	The move paid off.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm just really thankful that I'm a part of a team that's  
still playing,'' Van Gundy said. ``And what small part I play in 
it, I take very seriously. I do the job the best I can. '' 
</P>
<P>
	In this case, it meant departing from what got the Knicks here  
and taking a gamble or two to try to help offset the loss of center 
Patrick Ewing. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you become paralyzed by the thought that you may be  
criticized for doing something, you're never going to be the risk 
taker you need to be as a good coach. Risk taking is part of it. If 
it doesn't work out, you've got to accept the responsibility for it 
not working out,'' Van Gundy said.

<HEADLINE> Hechinger Co. files for Protection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LARGO, Md. (AP) -- Hechinger Co., the home improvement chain that  
has struggled against rivals Home Depot Inc. and Lowe's Cos., plans 
to close 89 stores under a Chapter 11 reorganization plan filed 
Friday with U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Delaware. 
</P>
<P>
	The Largo-based retailer said it will focus on a core of 117  
healthier stores in 21 states. 
</P>
<P>
	The company said it will concentrate on larger Hechinger stores  
and its HQ-Home Quarters Warehouse outlets. The company also plans 
to convert its remaining 16 Builders Square stores to the Home 
Quarters format, under the Chapter 11 filing, which is subject to 
Bankruptcy Court approval. 
</P>
<P>
	``Filing for Chapter 11 and closing these unprofitable locations  
is the crucial first step in our efforts to remake Hechinger,'' 
said chairman Mark Adams. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts have said nervous suppliers are cutting back credit,  
intensifying Hechinger's cash problems. The credit problems come at 
a bad time for Hechinger, which is having trouble stocking store 
shelves just as homeowners are most eager to spend money for home 
and garden improvements, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
	Kenneth M. Gassman Jr., an analyst with Davenport &AMP; Co. in  
Richmond, Va., predicted that the reorganization would give 
Hechinger three years of life. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're getting to the point where they're not going to be  
able to compete successfully,'' Gassman said. ``I think they'll 
implode further.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hechinger listed $1.3 billion in assets with liabilities  
totaling $1.4 billion. Those liabilities included $323 million in 
bond debt. The company said it would also seek up to $700 million 
in financing from BankBoston Retain Finance Inc. to continue normal 
business operations during reorganization. 
</P>
<P>
	The company failed to make a $4.7 million interest payment on  
its unsecured debt May 15 and reported a loss of $228 million for 
the quarter ending April 3. 
</P>
<P>
	In a related development, Kmart Corp. said it will set aside  
$230 million to cover costs stemming from lease guarantees in its 
1997 sale of the Builders Square chain of stores to Hechinger. 
</P>
<P>
	Builders Square was one of four subsidiaries that Kmart sold or  
spun off as part of a plan to refocus on its discount retail 
stores. Under that deal, Kmart said it would guarantee leases now 
worth $1.2 billion, of which $761 million is for Builders Square 
stores. 
</P>
<P>
	Scott Campbell, an analyst for Detroit-based Roney &AMP; Co., said  
the deal would not hurt Kmart badly, noting many of the stores are 
in desirable locations with spaces large enough to lure warehouse 
retailers such as Sam's Club or Costco. 
</P>
<P>
	``The (retailers) would love to get these spaces,'' Campbell  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Founded in 1911, Hechinger grew into a Washington, D.C.  
institution and one of the first large-scale home-improvement 
chains in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
	By the early 1990s, however, it was clear that the Hechinger  
family had failed to recognize the threat posed by Home Depot and 
Lowe's, which were beginning to dot the suburbs with superstores. 
</P>
<P>
	Hechinger was sold two years ago for $507 million to Leonard  
Green &AMP; Partners, a Los Angeles investment group. At the same time, 
Hechinger combined Builders Square with two other chains to create 
the third-largest home-improvement retailer behind its two rivals. 
</P>
<P>
	Since then, Home Depot and Lowe's have added stores and boosted  
profits, while Hechinger has struggled. The company has remodeled 
stores while closing others and had 206 locations in May. 
</P>
<P>
	Gassman said Hechinger erred by not building more large stores  
in far-flung, developing suburbs and by concentrating on 
established locations closer to big cities, which suffered from 
suburban sprawl. 
</P>
<P>
	Many Hechinger outlets also suffer from undersized  
lawn-and-garden centers, narrow, poorly lit aisles, disorganized 
stock and employees that aren't knowledgeable about the company's 
products, Gassman added. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think Hechinger did not listen closely enough to their  
customers,'' Gassman said. ``Those are the kinds of things that 
turn people off.''

<HEADLINE> AP Corrects Media Ruling Story </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- In a June 10 story about court action in a case  
involving NBC's ``Dateline'' show, The Associated Press erroneously 
reported that the segment in question was about the Louisiana state 
police. 
</P>
<P>
	The court case centers on whether NBC has to hand over a  
videotape made for a segment that showed a Calcasieu Parish 
sheriff's deputy stopping a car. The network was investigating 
whether law enforcement officials were making decisions based on 
race, nationality or out-of-state plates. 
</P>
<P>
	The 2nd U.S. Court of Appeals had ruled in September that NBC  
had to hand the tape over to lawyers for a Hispanic couple who are 
suing the deputy, alleging civil rights violations. The June 9 
story reported that the court had set aside that ruling, saying it 
may need to rehear that issue.

<HEADLINE> Woman Accused in Cosby Case Released </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DUBLIN, Calif. (AP) -- Autumn Jackson was whisked out of prison  
by relatives without saying a word about her overturned conviction 
or the 14 months she spent in prison for allegedly trying to 
blackmail Bill Cosby. 
</P>
<P>
	``She's on her way home,'' said her New York attorney, Robert  
Baum, after the family drove up from Los Angeles to meet Ms. 
Jackson on Thursday at the minimum-security women's prison in this 
east San Francisco Bay suburb. 
</P>
<P>
	Among those greeting Ms. Jackson was her mother, Shawn Upshaw,  
who had an affair with Cosby in the 1970s and accepted more than 
$100,000 in financial support from him over the years. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Jackson, 24, had served 14 months of a 26-month sentence for  
extortion, conspiracy and crossing state lines to commit a crime. 
She had allegedly tried to blackmail Cosby out of $40 million, 
threatening to tell tabloid newspapers that she was his 
illegitimate daughter. 
</P>
<P>
	But the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled Wednesday that  
the trial judge incorrectly instructed the jury on the law of 
extortion. The court also overturned the convictions of two 
accomplices for the same reason, ordering a retrial. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Jackson made no public comments at the prison. At her  
sentencing in December 1997, she made a tearful apology, saying she 
should have stopped the plot. 
</P>
<P>
	``I knew Mr. Cosby held great expectations for me,'' Ms. Jackson  
said then. ``I let him down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The case tarnished Cosby's wholesome image as America's faithful  
husband and father when he was forced to disclose the affair. 
</P>
<P>
	But he repeatedly denied he is Ms. Jackson's father. Cosby took  
a paternity test after the trial to try to settle the dispute, but 
Ms. Jackson and her mother declined to take blood tests.

<HEADLINE> Ryan White Foundation Close to Broke </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Nearly 10 years after his death, the name  
Ryan White doesn't seem to move people as it used to. Neither does 
the cause he represented. 
</P>
<P>
	The Indiana teen-ager became a national spokesman for children  
with AIDS during his highly publicized court battle to attend 
school more than a decade ago. Michael Jackson, Elton John and 
Barbara Bush attended his funeral in April 1990, and Phil Donahue 
later helped launch an AIDS foundation in his name. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, the cause White championed seems to have lost its  
celebrated status and the foundation is running out of money. 
</P>
<P>
	White's mother, Jeanne White-Ginder, said funding for the Ryan  
White Foundation in Indianapolis has dwindled to almost nothing. 
The organization has nearly deserted its offices and laid off its 
permanent staff; an answering machine message said the foundation 
is closed. 
</P>
<P>
	``People are just not wanting to devote their time and effort to  
this disease anymore,'' White-Ginder said. ``I don't know what else 
to do. I shout, I scream in anger: Open up your eyes, America!'' 
</P>
<P>
	After nearly 20 years of living with the AIDS epidemic, there  
are signs people no longer treat it as a health emergency. 
</P>
<P>
	``Individuals, who after 14, 15 years of funding this issue are  
turning their attention to other issues such as breast cancer. 
They're thinking the AIDS crisis is in a sense over. Many are 
thinking, `How much longer do I have to support this?''' said Jack 
Cole, director of development with AIDServe Indiana. 
</P>
<P>
	More people believe patients can live with AIDS as new drugs  
help them survive longer, Cole said. And celebrities with AIDS such 
as Greg Louganis and Magic Johnson present the image that infected 
people can be healthy and robust. 
</P>
<P>
	In February, a Chicago hospice which cared exclusively for AIDS  
patients closed due to lack of patients. It was one of the last 
such hospices in the country. 
</P>
<P>
	Another sign of so-called ``AIDS burnout'' is the drop in  
support for nationwide AIDS Walks, said Tom Bartenbach, president 
of AIDServe Indiana. Attendance for the Indiana AIDS Walk was down 
almost 20 percent from last year, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	White-Ginder believes people are less willing to talk about the  
disease as well. 
</P>
<P>
	``The numbers of people with AIDS are increasing, but you don't  
hear about them because people are remaining silent,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Lawyer: Morgan Stanley Payment Legal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Morgan Stanley Dean Witter broke no federal or  
state laws when it paid $10,000 to an informant to set up a sting 
against a former employee, a company-sponsored investigation has 
found. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the law firm that examined the circumstances  
surrounding the operation against former junior analyst Christan 
Curry said that Morgan Stanley ``could have been more timely, 
cooperative and forthright'' in communicating with the Manhattan 
district attorney's office about the payment made to C. Joseph 
Luethke. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest chapter in what has become a public relations  
nightmare for the prominent Wall Street firm has resulted in two 
key personnel changes. 
</P>
<P>
	Christine Edwards, an executive vice president, managing  
director and the firm's chief legal officer, has stepped down from 
those positions, but will remain with the firm in a part-time 
advisory role, the financial services firm said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Monroe Sonnenborn, the managing director and general counsel of  
litigation and regulatory affairs -- and the senior-most employee 
directly involved with the payment, according to Morgan Stanley -- 
has resigned. 
</P>
<P>
	In a memo distributed to employees on Thursday, Morgan Stanley  
chairman and CEO Philip Purcell and president and chief operating 
officer John Mack said they were ready to move forward, according 
to a company statement. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no denying that this has been a difficult time for a  
firm, requiring painful decisions by some of our best people,'' 
Purcell and Mack wrote. ``But with the completion of the thorough 
investigation ... we are ready to put this matter behind us and 
move on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Curry, 25, who was fired by Morgan Stanley in April 1998, sued  
the firm in May for $1.35 billion, saying he was fired because of 
his race and because of nude photos of him that had appeared in a 
gay men's magazine. Morgan Stanley said he was fired for expense 
account abuses. 
</P>
<P>
	Four months after they fired Curry, company officials told  
police he was plotting to plant racist and homophobic e-mail in 
their computers. Curry was arrested last August on charges of 
forgery, coercion and computer trespass. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Manhattan district attorney's office dropped charges  
against Curry last month, and is now investigating Morgan Stanley 
and Luethke, in part because the firm had neglected to tell 
investigators immediately about the $10,000 payment to Luethke. 
</P>
<P>
	Subsequently, Morgan Stanley suspended Sonnenborn and Carol  
Bernheim, a principal in the firm's law department. On Thursday, 
the firm said Ms. Bernheim had been reinstated. 
</P>
<P>
	Wesley McDade, a spokesman for Morgan Stanley, said the internal  
investigation was completed and no more personnel moves would 
occur. 
</P>
<P>
	Morgan Stanley said it would continue to cooperate with the  
Manhattan district attorney and also defend itself against 
Christian Curry's lawsuit, which it said had no merit. 
</P>
<P>
	A message left for Curry's attorney, Earl Rawlins, was not  
immediately returned. 
</P>
<P>
	The outside law firm hired by Morgan Stanley-- Paul, Weiss,  
Rifkind, Wharton and Garrison -- said that Luethke presented himself 
to the firm in 1998 with information that he knew of a plot by 
Curry to plant racist and homophobic messages in the firm's e-mail 
system. 
</P>
<P>
	Luethke was a college acquaintance of Curry's who put Curry in  
touch with a computer hacker -- actually an undercover police 
officer -- at the same time he told Morgan Stanley about the plot. 
</P>
<P>
	He told Morgan Stanley he was putting himself at personal risk  
by exposing the plot, and that because the information about the 
fabricated evidence would save the firm some costly litigation and 
embarrassment, he was entitled to some compensation, Paul, Weiss 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rawlins has previously said that Curry paid a hacker $200 to  
plant phony e-mail. 
</P>
<P>
	Sonnenborn, after checking with another law firm, determined  
that as long as Luethke was not a witness to the Curry case, that a 
payment would be legal. Morgan Stanley eventually paid Luethke 
$10,000 ``in recognition of his assistance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	However, Paul, Weiss also determined that the district  
attorney's office was not made aware of the payment until six weeks 
after it had been made, saying it could ``find no satisfactory 
explanation for the failure to keep the district attorney informed 
of developments in the case.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Paul, Weiss said Mrs. Edwards, the chief legal officer, was  
unaware of a number of aspects regarding the payment, though she 
was informed about the payment about 24 hours before it occurred. 
She did not know until last month that the district attorney had 
issued two grand jury subpoenas to the firm in October 1998, the 
law firm said. 
</P>
<P>
	Paul, Weiss also said that neither of Morgan Stanley's top two  
officials, Mack and Purcell, were aware of the payment until April 
1999, eight months after it occurred.

<HEADLINE> Runner Marion Jones Returns to N.C. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) -- In Europe, fans ask for Marion Jones'  
autograph and the media crowds around her. 
</P>
<P>
	But in Raleigh, where she trains for track and field meets,  
physical education students and joggers pass her on the track with 
hardly a glance. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can go home to Raleigh and train in peace ... get on the  
plane and in six or seven hours you step off the plane -- you're a 
superstar,'' Jones, 23, said. 
</P>
<P>
	The world's top-ranked women's sprinter and long jumper competes  
mainly in Europe, which explains her relative anonymity at home. 
This week, she was in Finland and England. 
</P>
<P>
	But on Saturday, Jones and several other prominent U.S. athletes  
will share the spotlight in Raleigh at the Pontiac Grand Prix 
Invitational. The event will be at North Carolina State, where 
Jones trains six days a week. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones will compete only in the long jump. Her rivals include  
1996 Olympian Shana Williams. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones won the women's 200 meters at Helsinki Thursday night in  
21.91 seconds, .1 second off her seasonal best of 21.81. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody wants to see me run the sprints because those are  
the premier events,'' Jones said. ``This year ... we've made it a 
point to spend a lot of time on the long jump. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've improved on my technique, and I'm looking forward to  
jumping. It's great because I train in Raleigh every day. I'm quite 
familiar with that board and that pit, so this should be a good 
result.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jones' best in the long jump is 23 feet, 11 3/4 inches. The U.S.  
record of 24-7 was set twice by now-retired Jackie Joyner-Kersee. 
The world record of 24-8 1/4 was set in 1988 by Galina Chistyakova of 
the then-Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
	Saturday's meet is the fourth in USA Track &AMP; Field's five-meet  
Golden Spike Tour. The tour culminates with the USA Championships 
June 24-27 at Eugene, Ore. The men will compete in the 100, 200 and 
400 sprints and the 110 and 400 hurdles. The women will compete in 
the 400 and 800, the pole vault and the long jump. 
</P>
<P>
	The meet will be held within the framework of the outdoor  
championships for high school athletes. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones, who plans to try for five gold medals at the 2000  
Olympics, hopes her success in the sprints and long jump will 
improve her sports' popularity in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	She muses about the day when ``American athletes can stay at  
home and choose to go over to Europe and not have to go to 
Europe,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would love to be able to stay in the U.S. for most of the  
year,'' she said. ``Right now, we don't have that option.''

<HEADLINE> Sprouting Clover Seeds Recalled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Fearing possible salmonella contamination,  
Pinetree Garden Seeds has voluntarily recalled its Sprouting Clover 
seeds. 
</P>
<P>
	The seeds, packaged in a 3 oz. plastic bag, were sold via mail  
order from the company's 1999-2000 seed catalog to customers in the 
United States and Canada. The individual bags were labeled ``SP9, 
Packed for 1999 Sprouting Clover'' and also were sold as part of 
the Sprouting for Health Gift Set. 
</P>
<P>
	The company, based in Gloucester, Maine, said Thursday that the  
seeds have been implicated by the Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention in a salmonella outbreak in Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
	The company has not received any reports of illness. But it said  
customers should destroy any seeds purchased as well as any sprouts 
produced from the seeds.

<HEADLINE> Computer Crash Halts eBay Auctions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- MarGee Charlier knew her business was in  
trouble when she logged in first thing Friday morning and saw that 
eBay, the venerable online auction site, had crashed. 
</P>
<P>
	``Devastation,'' she said. ``Disaster.''  
</P>
<P>
	Charlier, of Kewaunee, Wis., supports her small business by  
selling between 50 to 100 antiques -- bringing in between $2,000 and 
$4,000 -- each day through the site. But not on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	All bidding was suspended at eBay as the so-called ``personal  
trading community'' with more than 3 million users in 50 countries 
struggled to rebuild a corrupted computer server. 
</P>
<P>
	The halt, which came after eBay tried to launch a revamped  
version of its site, disrupted bidding on millions of collectibles 
and curios, from military medals to mandolins. 
</P>
<P>
	``We do realize how frustrating this is for our community, and  
we are doing our best to ensure that the system is restored as 
quickly and efficiently as humanly possible,'' said eBay spokesman 
Kevin Pursglove on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Bidding was stopped Thursday around 11 p.m. EDT and is not  
expected to start up again until Friday afternoon. As of 5:30 p.m. 
EDT, however, the site remained down. 
</P>
<P>
	EBay users were met at the site with a continuing stream of  
updates and apologies from management. ``Thank you so much for your 
patience as we resolve this unfortunate situation,'' said one 
message Friday morning. 
</P>
<P>
	The apologies weren't worth much to Sharon Doney in Severn, Md.,  
who is trying to raise $250,000 this year through online auctions 
of records and books to cover medical bills for her failing liver. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is frustrating,'' she said. ``Say you were at a real  
auction and the auctioneer just walked away for a while. It just 
doesn't work.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Doney said that problems on eBay -- short crashes, slowdowns and  
postponed auction endings -- during the past few months have already 
prompted her to branch out into other auction sites, including eBay 
competitors Amazon.com and Yahoo! 
</P>
<P>
	John Dodge, editor of PC Week, said the company has had ``daily  
failures every few weeks, but this one is the biggest.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One of eBay's worst previous outages, which lasted about six  
hours, prevented the company from holding auctions of just-released 
merchandise tied to the latest ``Star Wars'' movie. 
</P>
<P>
	The site outage was unrelated to the Worm.Explore.Zip computer  
bug, which began infecting systems across the country this week. 
</P>
<P>
	Andrew Bartels, senior research analyst at Cambridge,  
Mass.-based Giga Information Group, said outages should be expected 
in this type of burgeoning emerging technology. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's actually not that big of a deal,'' he said. ``This is  
still new technology and these high transaction sites will 
periodically go down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bartels said that eBay traders have less to lose than online  
stock brokers, who have also experienced site crashes in recent 
weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	But eBay users said the effect of the crash radiated well beyond  
the people who buy and sell trinkets on eBay. 
</P>
<P>
	Jeff Schlicht of San Mateo, Calif., whose software program  
called AuctionPoster makes it easy to list dozens or hundreds of 
items on eBay, said his customers thought there must be something 
wrong with his own program. 
</P>
<P>
	``EBay is definitely having growing pains, and that's a big  
problem for me,'' he said. ``I can't make excuses for them, but I 
depend on them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``This is going to be a big boost for Amazon,'' he added.  
``Every single time stuff like this happens, customers start asking 
me when I'm going to design a system for another auction site.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Casual users appeared less affected, however.  
</P>
<P>
	Frank DeCaro, a writer in New York City who has bought  
everything from diet books to super hero glasses through eBay, said 
the crash would save him time and money.

<HEADLINE> Judge Considers Damages in SI Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- A federal judge is deciding whether  
Sports Illustrated alone is responsible for paying punitive damages 
for former boxer Randall ``Tex'' Cobb. 
</P>
<P>
	The issue is whether the magazine's parent, Time Inc., also can  
be held liable for the damages. 
</P>
<P>
	A jury has already awarded Cobb $8.5 million in compensatory  
damages as a result of his libel suit against the magazine. The 
jury was to begin determining punitive damages today. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Robert Echols heard arguments today over  
whether the damages should come from just Sports Illustrated or 
from its parent. 
</P>
<P>
	Sports Illustrated's attorneys told the judge the lawsuit was  
solely against Sports Illustrated, which has its own accounting 
division. 
</P>
<P>
	But Cobb's attorney said the magazine can not be separated from  
Time Inc. and that several of the parent company's resources were 
used in researching the story. 
</P>
<P>
	The jury must decide how much more the magazine should pay Cobb  
as punishment for a 1993 article that said the boxer fixed a fight 
and shared cocaine with the loser. 
</P>
<P>
	The jury awarded the compensatory damages Wednesday.  
</P>
<P>
	Cobb, 46, had asked for $50 million in compensatory damages and  
$100 million in punitive damages. Cobb, who declined to comment 
Thursday, has said the article ended his boxing career and nearly 
ended his acting career. 
</P>
<P>
	``Tex has been a prisoner of this article for six years and  
there's no better feeling in the world than to have a jury come in 
and set the record straight,'' Cobb's attorney, George Bochetto, 
said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	An attorney for the magazine, Eddie Wayland, had no comment  
Thursday about the award. 
</P>
<P>
	Cobb sued in 1994 over an article headlined ``The Fix Was In.''  
The story began with an anecdote about the 1992 bout between Cobb 
and Sonny Barch, a journeyman fighter and former Memphis State 
football player. 
</P>
<P>
	The magazine reported that Cobb and Barch discussed how to throw  
the fight. The story said Cobb had an injured shoulder and wanted 
it to end as quickly as possible. 
</P>
<P>
	In the article, Barch said he told Cobb: ``I'm going to have to  
hit you to make it look good. But I won't hit your shoulder.'' 
Barch told Sports Illustrated that Cobb responded: ``Bubba, I 
appreciate it. I'll make it up to you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Barch allowed Cobb to hit him three times, dropping to a knee  
each time and triggering the three-knockdown rule, Sports 
Illustrated reported. Cobb was declared the winner by technical 
knockout. 
</P>
<P>
	The magazine also reported that Barch said he, Cobb and a fight  
promoter shared cocaine after the bout. Sports Illustrated said 
Cobb had tested positive for cocaine use, but said in a follow-up 
item that it was marijuana. 
</P>
<P>
	Wayland told the jury that the article by writers William Nack  
and Sonja Steptoe was accurate and that any damage done to Cobb's 
reputation was the result of his own actions. 
</P>
<P>
	``They believed the story was true. They believed it then and  
they believe it now,'' Wayland said. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Ms. Steptoe testified last month she had little  
evidence that Cobb was a willing participant in a fixed fight with 
Barch. 
</P>
<P>
	Since he quit fighting, Cobb has had roles in several movies,  
including ``Liar, Liar, ``Raising Arizona,'' ``Uncommon Valor'' and 
``The Golden Child.'' He has also been in the TV shows 
``Moonlighting'' and ``MacGyver.''

<HEADLINE> NL Investigating Valentine Conduct </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Bobby Valentine's new disguise is likely to get  
him a fine or a suspension from the National League. 
</P>
<P>
	The New York Mets manager wasn't confusing Wednesday night's  
game against Toronto with Halloween. He merely returned to the 
bench incognito after he was thrown out by umpires. 
</P>
<P>
	``From the information we have, he was ejected and came back to  
the end of the dugout in a disguise,'' NL senior vice president 
Katy Feeney said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Valentine was ejected in the 12th inning by plate umpire Randy  
Marsh for arguing a catcher's interference call on Mike Piazza. The 
manager, according to information reported to the NL, returned to 
the dugout with a fake mustache and glasses. 
</P>
<P>
	Feeney said the league was investigating and hoped to have a  
decision by today. A fine or suspension was considered likely, one 
baseball official said on the condition he not be identified. 
</P>
<P>
	Mets spokesman Jay Horwitz had no comment.  
</P>
<P>
	An eight-game losing streak, the team's longest in three years,  
prompted general manager Steve Phillips to fire three of 
Valentine's coaches last Saturday, a move the manager didn't agree 
with. Two of those fired, pitching coach Bob Apodaca and hitting 
coach Tom Robson, were close to Valentine. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the firings, the Mets have won four straight.  
</P>
<P>
	In other Mets turmoil, outfielder Bobby Bonilla told the team he  
was unavailable to play in Tuesday's and Wednesday's games. 
</P>
<P>
	Bonilla, hitting .167 with four homers and 17 RBIs, didn't take  
batting practice Wednesday and exchanged bitter words with 
Valentine before the game, the Post reported. Last week, Bonilla 
was upset after a report the Mets placed him on waivers and he 
wasn't claimed. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would like it to be resolved sooner rather than later,''  
general manager Steve Phillips said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Valentine wasn't in favor of the offseason trade that brought  
Bonilla back to New York from Los Angeles, but co-owner Nelson 
Doubleday pushed for the move. Phillips sounded as if the Bonilla 
matter was troubling. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we have to look at all avenues,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Also, outfielder Benny Agbayani was cleared to return Friday.  
The rookie, hitting .409 with eight homers in 66 at-bats, bruised 
his right eye in batting practice Wednesday when he hit a ball off 
the cage and it bounced back into his eye. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mets said a CT scan was negative and eye specialist Dr.  
Bruce Zagelbaum said Agbayani could return tonight against Boston.

<HEADLINE> Ford Europe Operations Get New Head </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Ford Motor Co. named the architect of Jaguar Cars  
Ltd.'s revival to head its struggling European automotive 
operations Friday, the latest move aimed at improving the No. 2 
automaker's lackluster performance in what was once one of its 
biggest profit centers. 
</P>
<P>
	Nick Scheele, most recently vice president for marketing, sales  
and service at Ford of Europe, replaces James D. Donaldson as 
president of the unit. Donaldson in turn was named group vice 
president in charge of global business development. The changes are 
effective July 1. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford has been fighting the steady erosion of its market share in  
Europe for the past few years. In the first quarter, its European 
operations only managed to break even. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ford has had a very disappointing performance for quite a  
substantial time now,'' said Charles Young, an industry analyst 
with J.D. Power-LMC International Ltd. in London. 
</P>
<P>
	The automaker this year has been expanding with a series of  
European acquisitions, led by the purchase of Sweden's Volvo Car 
Corp. It also bought Kwik-Fit, a British chain of service shops, a 
controlling stake in Norwegian electric-car manufacturer Pivco AS, 
and a share in the largest group of Ford dealers in the United 
Kingdom. 
</P>
<P>
	Donaldson also recently launched an effort to reorganize Ford of  
Europe and bring the new units into a more integrated structure. 
Ford president Jac Nasser said Scheele was ``committed to 
continuation of the policies started by Donaldson.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Details of the reorganization have yet to be worked out, but  
Donaldson suggested in a recent interview with the trade weekly 
Automotive News that Ford will return to a more autonomous European 
operation. Under the Ford 2000 global reorganization launched four 
years ago, Ford of Europe lost its regional autonomy 
</P>
<P>
	Ford has suffered in part from an aging product lineup as  
competitors, such as Germany's Volkswagen AG, have come out with 
hit new models. One exception is the Focus subcompact, but analysts 
say it hasn't been on the market long enough to determine if it 
will be a long-term success. 
</P>
<P>
	``The early indications are not entirely encouraging,'' Young  
said. ``What is very clear is that in all the other market segments 
they are losing share quite seriously.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nasser acknowledged recently that Ford's European performance  
has been disappointing. 
</P>
<P>
	``Volvo helps, without any question, because it gives us greater  
economies of scale within Europe,'' Nasser said last month. ``It 
gives us a brand between Ford and Jaguar that we did not have 
before.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Scheele, 55, is highly regarded in the industry for the  
turnaround he engineered at Jaguar, the once-failing British 
producer of trouble-prone luxury cars. He was chairman and chief 
executive of Jaguar for seven years before moving to Ford of Europe 
in March. 
</P>
<P>
	Since Ford's purchase of Jaguar in 1989 for $2.5 billion, it has  
managed to maintain the unique styling and feel of Jaguar cars 
while improving their reliability, the result of its $3.5 billion 
overhaul of Jaguar's aged manufacturing system and model line. 
</P>
<P>
	Donaldson, 56, will be in charge of overseeing the direction of  
Ford's future automotive and non-automotive businesses. ``It is 
imperative to have a seasoned, experienced business person with a 
global perspective working on strategic issues affecting the 
company,'' Nasser said.

<HEADLINE> Va. and Md. Plan High-Tech Corridor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Business leaders will endorse an educational  
curriculum designed to encourage students to enter the high-tech 
industry and a new road and rail connection linking the technology 
corridors of northern Virginia and suburban Maryland. 
</P>
<P>
	Business leaders, public officials and educators, led by America  
Online Chief Executive Steve Case, also are expected to approve 
today a $30 million venture-capital fund to invest in local 
bioscience companies. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not just a government town, in fact almost as many  
people are employed by private sector high technology firms as 
there are in the area's federal workforce,'' said Michael Heyman, 
secretary of the Smithsonian Institution. 
</P>
<P>
	He is among 250 executives invited to the Ronald Reagan  
International Trade Center in Washington to hear about the series 
of initiatives aimed at helping to make the region rival northern 
California's Silicon Valley. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got the jobs, and the science, and when Congress wants  
to look at cutting edge technology they can stay right here,'' said 
Mary Anne Reynolds, the spokeswoman for the Washington Board of 
Trade. 
</P>
<P>
	Business leaders attending the conference will be asked to  
pledge at least $5 million initially to move the agenda forward, 
The Washington Post reported. 
</P>
<P>
	The Post quotes conference participants who said the resources  
of technology executives have energized a regional planning effort 
long stymied by the political rivalries dividing the District of 
Columbia, Maryland and Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
	According to a Potomac KnowledgeWay-Washington Board of Trade  
study, the information-communications sector of the regional 
economy now employs one out of seven workers in the greater 
Washington area. 
</P>
<P>
	The 328,000 jobs and 25,000 current openings eclipse the 340,000  
federal jobs the District of Columbia and 15 northern Virginia and 
suburban Maryland counties. 
</P>
<P>
	The more than 3,000 high-tech firms in Maryland, Washington and  
northern Virginia have annual sales of $90 billion, according to 
the Board of Trade. 
</P>
<P>
	Since last January, business leaders, elected officials, and  
educators have worked to identify ways to mobilize the area's 
academic and corporate institutions toward activism. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want employees who are stuck in traffic everyday to put  
more pressure on elected officials to force more cooperation on 
solving these gridlock problems,'' Reynolds said.

<HEADLINE> Ricky Martin Rocks Rockefeller Center </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- About 3,000 people jammed the blocks around  
NBC's ``Today'' studio Friday to catch a live outdoor performance 
by Ricky Martin, the Puerto Rican singing sensation. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was so good. Now I can brag to all my friends,'' said a  
delighted 12-year-old Jennifer Rasmussen of Toms River, N.J., who 
woke up at 4 a.m. and played hooky from school to see Martin. 
</P>
<P>
	As the throng squealed and threw streamers and confetti, Martin  
performed his signature hit, ``Livin' la Vida Loca'' -- which means 
living the crazy life -- and two other songs on an outdoor stage in 
Rockefeller Center. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's just so hot,'' said Rocia Rivera, a 26-year-old tourist  
from Puerto Rico. 
</P>
<P>
	A few dozen fans camped out Thursday night to get a good spot.  
</P>
<P>
	``He's really cute, and I heard that he's sweet,'' said Christy  
Monior, 17, who came with three friends. ``It's a bonding 
experience.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Suzanne Martinez, 49, and her daughter, Alysa Monachelli, 29,  
have followed Martin around the country since he was 12 and singing 
with the '80s pop group Menudo. Ms. Monachelli's 4-year-old 
daughter, Ashtyn, knows every word to ``La Vida Loca.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``She's been dancing to his music since she was 1,'' Ms.  
Monachelli said. 
</P>
<P>
	Martin, 27, is enjoying success with his first English-language  
CD, titled simply ``Ricky Martin.'' It had the best-ever album 
debut by a Hispanic artist on the mainstream Billboard charts.

<HEADLINE> McCain Cites Growing Youth Cynicism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republican presidential hopeful John McCain  
said today that President Clinton and Congress ``seldom seem to be 
occupied with great causes,'' leading to a growing cynicism among 
America's youth. 
</P>
<P>
	``The higher ground for all of us has become the politically  
advantageous ground,'' McCain said in remarks prepared for a speech 
to a conference of U.S. mayors in New Orleans. ``I wonder if we 
know what the concept of country means anymore. It's not supposed 
to be a synonym for party.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Arizona senator said Americans seem to be losing its sense  
of national community and pride. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think we're all that proud anymore or that most  
Americans, especially the young, can see beyond the veil of their 
cynicism and indifference to imagine themselves as part of a cause 
greater than their self interest,'' McCain said. 
</P>
<P>
	The blame for that, McCain said, lies with the nation's elected  
leaders. 
</P>
<P>
	``In Washington, we seldom seem to do anything big enough to  
convince even the most gullible that we are serving a cause greater 
than ourselves,'' McCain said. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain pointed to the flurry of legislation following the school  
shootings in Littleton, Colo., as typical behavior of many leaders 
in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	``How do our children see us respond to that tragedy?'' McCain  
asked. ``They see us engage in our typical partisanship.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McCain also criticized President Clinton's reaction to the  
Littleton shootings, saying he sent the wrong message to America's 
youth when he criticized entertainment's role in the tragedy while 
still depending on Hollywood money for campaign donations. 
</P>
<P>
	``They see the president criticize Hollywood for driving our  
culture toward the bottom after he caters to them for campaign 
contributions,'' McCain said. ``Juvenile violence shouldn't be a 
sound bite.''

<HEADLINE> SI Ordered To Pay Boxer $10.7 Mil. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- A jury on Friday ordered Time Inc. to  
pay $10.7 million to ex-heavyweight boxer Randall ``Tex'' Cobb for 
a 1993 Sports Illustrated article that said he fixed a fight and 
shared cocaine with the loser. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal jury awarded Cobb $2.2 million in punitive damages  
to go with $8.5 million it awarded Wednesday in compensatory 
damages. He had demanded up to $100 million in his libel lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	Judge Robert Echols ruled that the jury could consider the  
financial resources of Time Inc., the magazine's parent, in 
determining the punitive damage figure. 
</P>
<P>
	Echols must still give the figure final approval, and the  
magazine said it would appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	When the award was announced, Cobb, 46, shook hands with his  
lawyer, who patted him on the hand. Cobb had contended the article 
ended his boxing career and nearly ended his acting career. 
</P>
<P>
	``Tex has been a prisoner of this article for six years and  
there's no better feeling in the world than to have a jury come in 
and set the record straight,'' lawyer George Bochetto said. He said 
the verdict tells magazine officials ``that they did wrong and you 
better not do it again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Steve Robinson, managing editor of CNN-SI and a former Sports  
Illustrated senior editor who worked on the story, said the verdict 
``shocked us,'' adding, ``we're very confident we will prevail on 
appeal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cobb sued in 1994 over the article headlined ``The Fix Was In.''  
The story began with an anecdote about the 1992 bout between Cobb 
and Sonny Barch, a journeyman fighter and former Memphis State 
football player. 
</P>
<P>
	The magazine said Cobb and Barch discussed how to throw the  
fight. The story said Cobb had an injured shoulder and wanted it to 
end as quickly as possible. 
</P>
<P>
	In the article, Barch said he told Cobb: ``I'm going to have to  
hit you to make it look good. But I won't hit your shoulder.'' 
Barch said that Cobb responded: ``Bubba, I appreciate it. I'll make 
it up to you,'' according to the article. 
</P>
<P>
	Barch allowed Cobb to hit him three times, dropping to a knee  
each time and triggering the three-knockdown rule, Sports 
Illustrated reported. Cobb was declared the winner by technical 
knockout 70 seconds into the fight. 
</P>
<P>
	The magazine also reported that Barch said he, Cobb and a fight  
promoter shared cocaine after the bout. Sports Illustrated reported 
that both Barch and Cobb had flunked post-fight drug tests and the 
fight was declared a no-contest. In a follow-up, Sports Illustrated 
said that Cobb had tested positive for marijuana. 
</P>
<P>
	Sports Illustrated lawyer Eddie Wayland told the jury that the  
article by writers William Nack and Sonja Steptoe was accurate and 
that any damage to Cobb's reputation was the result of his own 
actions. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Steptoe testified last month she had little evidence  
that Cobb was a willing participant in a fixed fight with Barch. 
And boxing referee Steven Smoger said Cobb showed ``excellent'' 
technique. 
</P>
<P>
	Since he quit fighting, Cobb has had roles in movies including  
``Liar, Liar,'' ``Raising Arizona,'' ``Uncommon Valor'' and ``The 
Golden Child.'' He has also been in the TV shows ``Moonlighting'' 
and ``MacGyver.''

<HEADLINE> Albright Arrives in Macedonia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SKOPJE, Macedonia (AP) -- Secretary of State Madeleine Albright  
praised American troops preparing today to move into Kosovo as 
peacekeepers and assured refugees they would soon be able to return 
home ``to live a decent normal life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Addressing the troops, Albright said, ``The country you will be  
freeing has gone through some dreadful times. I know this is not 
easy on you. We are deeply honored to have you do this. You are 
bringing in a new history.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Albright was surprised when she arrived in Macedonia and heard  
reports that Russian troops were moving toward Kosovo. But she 
received assurances from Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov that 
the troop movement was just a preliminary step and the Russians 
would not deploy into Kosovo until arrangements were worked out, 
her spokesman James P. Rubin said. He also said the Russians 
understand there will be a unified command under NATO for the 
eventual 50,000 peacekeepers. 
</P>
<P>
	Albright was told of the movement by British Lt. Gen. Michael  
Jackson, commander of NATO troops in Macedonia, and then talked by 
telephone with Ivanov. 
</P>
<P>
	Albright ordered Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott to  
return to Moscow immediately. Talbott, who had been in Moscow 
discussing arrangements for the participation of the Russians in 
peacekeeping, was en route to Brussels. 
</P>
<P>
	In Washington, National Security Adviser Sandy Berger was  
optimistic. ``I think they'll work it out,'' Berger said. 
</P>
<P>
	Later, Albright visited camp Stenkovic I, the first refugee camp  
established here and a tent city that's home to about 25,000 
refugees, many of them children. 
</P>
<P>
	Albright counseled against vengeance and said the goal was a  
multi-ethnic democracy in Kosovo. But she also acknowledged the 
task was awesome and said many of the refugees may not be able to 
get home before the onset of winter. 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement to hundreds of refugees crowded behind a rope,  
Albright said ``we want you to rebuild. We want you to go home. But 
be very careful, there are land mines. All the world knows about 
your suffering, they know you want to go home and have a normal 
life. You will go home and be able to live a decent normal life and 
do it your way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After meeting with Gen. Jackson, she was taken by motorcade to  
Camp Able Sentry, a base for U.S. troops preparing to go into 
Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will have to do some winterizing of the tents in the  
camps,'' Albright said before departing for Macedonia to visit 
refugees and consult with government leaders. ``We can't count on 
everyone getting back before the weather.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, Albright said, investigators, possibly  
including the FBI, want to get to Kosovo as quickly as possible 
before evidence of atrocities is destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
	In all, 400,000 uprooted civilians are in Kosovo, another  
500,000 are in Albania, about 200,000 are in Macedonia and others 
are scattered in Hungary and elsewhere, Albright said. Many were 
stripped of their identity papers, complicating their return. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier Thursday, trying to rally international support to  
rebuild Southeastern Europe, Albright said, ``It is time to bust 
the ghost of the Balkans past and build a new reality'' with 
reconstruction and democracy. 
</P>
<P>
	Albright and the foreign ministers of seven other world powers,  
including Russia, ended four days of talks dominated by Kosovo. 
They met with foreign ministers of the Balkan nations to sign a 
stability pact aimed at helping all countries in the region 
economically and ultimately bringing them into the European 
political fold. 
</P>
<P>
	They agreed the Europeans would bear most of the financial  
burden after the United States took the lead in winning the war. 
``Southeast Europe is a part of Europe. It is our priority,'' 
German Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to be expensive,'' Albright said, but she offered  
no estimate of the cost. Whatever it is, rebuilding is ``our gift 
to the next generation,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Although both Albright and Fischer denounced Yugoslav President  
Slobodan Milosevic -- Fischer said Milosevic had pursued a ``fascist 
policy'' -- there were no calls for revenge, and Kosovo Serbs were 
urged to stay. 
</P>
<P>
	``Revenge is not appropriate,'' Albright said. ``We would like  
Kosovo to become a multi-ethnic society.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Albright likened the task to the Marshall Plan, which helped  
rebuild Western Europe after World War II, and efforts to bring 
prosperity to Eastern Europe since the fall of communism. 
</P>
<P>
	``We do not want the conflict now ending in Kosovo to be the  
prelude to others,'' she told representatives of more than 30 
nations as NATO suspended the bombing of Yugoslavia. ``We want to 
build the true basis for a new era of peace.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fischer spoke hopefully of the ``end of the Yugoslav wars''  
after nearly a decade of bloodshed. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want all countries in the region to develop toward an  
integrated Europe,'' said Fischer, who chaired the meetings as 
leader of the host nation.

<HEADLINE> Fireball From Gas Leak Kills Three </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BELLINGHAM, Wash. (AP) -- A gigantic fireball sparked by  
thousands of gallons of leaking gasoline raced down a stream for a 
mile and a half killing three people, including two boys. 
</P>
<P>
	People ran for their lives Thursday when they smelled gas fumes.  
The fuel, leaking from a pipeline, caused several explosions and 
sent a huge cloud of black smoke six miles into the sky. 
</P>
<P>
	``It looked like a napalm drop,'' said Grant Stevens, who lives  
nearby. 
</P>
<P>
	The gasoline ran down Whatcom Creek, a stream that runs from a  
park through residential neighborhoods and the downtown of this 
northwest Washington city of 60,000. 
</P>
<P>
	The cause of the leak was not immediately known, nor was the  
source of the ignition, said officials of Olympic Pipe Line Co., 
the operators of the line. 
</P>
<P>
	Spot fires still burned Friday, preventing investigators from a  
close examination. 
</P>
<P>
	The amount spilled had not been determined, but estimates ranged  
from 84,000 gallons to 277,000 gallons. 
</P>
<P>
	Two 10-year-old playmates, Wade King and Stephen Tsiorvas, died  
Friday at a hospital of burns that covered 90 percent of their 
bodies. Relatives said the boys had been playing by the creek. 
</P>
<P>
	A family friend, Tyrome Francisco, 16, ran from the house after  
hearing the explosion to search for the boys. He spotted them 
ablaze in a field of black smoke near the creek. 
</P>
<P>
	Andrew Tsiorvas, 15, said his younger brother told him that he  
and Wade had jumped into the creek to try to escape the flames. 
</P>
<P>
	Police identified the body of the third victim as Liam Gordon  
Wood, 19, who had graduated from high school just last week. He had 
been fishing in the creek a short distance upstream from where the 
boys had been playing, officers said. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said fewer than 10 other people were treated for minor  
injuries at hospitals and released. 
</P>
<P>
	A city water pumping station and one house were destroyed.

<HEADLINE> Aerospace Firms Seek Air Show Boost </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PARIS (AP) -- Fallout from the conflict in Yugoslavia and a drop  
in demand for commercial airliners have cast a shadow over the 
prospects of aerospace companies participating in the world's 
biggest air show, which opens Saturday near Paris. 
</P>
<P>
	Business for suppliers of fighter jets could suffer because  
Western governments face steep bills for their military involvement 
in the Balkans and may have less cash to upgrade air forces. 
</P>
<P>
	``My worry is that ultimately the whole Kosovo thing could kill  
the `peace dividend,' '' said Sash Tusa, a defense industry analyst 
with Goldman Sachs in London. 
</P>
<P>
	But companies are competing for expected replacement orders for  
bombs and missiles used in the conflict as well as spare parts for 
the fighters that flew thousands of sorties over Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	The battle for commercial aircraft business also is  
intensifying. Sales of civilian aircraft appear to have peaked, 
with the world's main builders of large passenger planes -- Boeing 
Co. and Europe's Airbus Industrie -- struggling to match last year's 
record of 1,200 airliners sold. 
</P>
<P>
	Amid this uncertainty, the Paris Air Show at Le Bourget airport  
north of the French capital will offer aviation companies one of 
their best opportunities to impress potential customers. 
</P>
<P>
	The event has attracted 1,765 exhibitors from 40 countries.  
French President Jacques Chirac is to inaugurate it, underscoring 
the aerospace industry's strategic and political significance. 
</P>
<P>
	The show, held every other year, will be an occasion for some  
companies to announce new contracts. Lockheed Martin Corp. of 
Bethesda, Md., even jumped the gun, announcing Thursday that it has 
awarded contracts worth $200 million to British suppliers of parts 
used in its C-130J Hercules heavy transport. 
</P>
<P>
	However, sales of aircraft and aviation equipment are normally  
completed after lengthy negotiations, and the weeklong show is less 
a place for participants to strike deals than to show off. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the potential crowd-pleasers: ergonomic pilot seats,  
rocket propulsion systems, unmanned surveillance aircraft and a 
device billed as the world's first miniature airborne VCR. 
</P>
<P>
	Seattle-based Boeing will hold flight demonstrations of its new  
100-seat aircraft, the 717-200, and visitors can see the 
Eurofighter, a jet built by a four-nation European consortium. 
</P>
<P>
	At stake are shares in an increasingly competitive industry.  
</P>
<P>
	``The export market is looking pretty dodgy as far as I can  
see,'' said Sanjay Jha, an analyst with the London-based brokerage 
Williams de Broe. 
</P>
<P>
	Demand for civilian aircraft is slackening in Europe and North  
America. The effects of financial crises continue to linger in East 
Asia, where air travel is just beginning to return to levels seen 
three years ago, and low oil prices have sapped the purchasing 
power of buyers in the Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
	``It appears that we may have reached a peak in the order cycle  
in 1998,'' said Dick James, head of Boeing's operations in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	Boeing plans to deliver 620 planes to customers this year but  
only 480 in 2000, a decrease of 23 percent. James said he expects 
the slackening in global demand to persist until 2002, further 
pinching the company's profit margins after the past two ``very 
difficult'' years. 
</P>
<P>
	Boeing had a loss of $178 million in 1997 and earnings were  
depressed in 1998. It has acknowledged that it is wasting billions 
of dollars on unprofitable businesses, which are under review. But 
profit surged in the first quarter of this year. 
</P>
<P>
	The market for military planes and equipment is tough as well,  
but for different reasons. 
</P>
<P>
	Western governments were just starting to place their first  
major aircraft orders since the Cold War when NATO bombers took to 
the air over Yugoslavia, causing a significant drain on spare parts 
and munitions. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every missile that's been fired has to be replaced,'' said  
Zafar Khan an aerospace analyst in London with the French bank 
Societe Generale. 
</P>
<P>
	One business that stands to benefit is Raytheon Co. of  
Lexington, Mass., maker of Tomahawk cruise missiles. Raytheon said 
last week that it expects to sell $1 billion in cruise missiles and 
other munitions as a direct result of the Kosovo conflict. 
</P>
<P>
	Producers of laser-guided bombs and other so-called ``smart''  
weapons also are likely to get a boost, and the 78 straight days of 
sorties flown by NATO jets suggest that alliance members will be 
spending large sums on maintenance work and engine overhauls. 
</P>
<P>
	As a result of these expenses, however, analysts say that  
tightfisted Western governments are unlikely to order lots of new 
planes. 
</P>
<P>
	Countries in Asia, Africa and Latin America look equally  
reluctant to splurge. 
</P>
<P>
	``None of these countries is awash in cash,'' said Jha, the  
analyst at Williams de Broe. ``The issue is, what is the threat? 
There are more pressing issues.''

<HEADLINE> Potato, Dancing Raisins Cut a Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) -- Spencer Sweetpotato and the dancing  
California raisins have declared a truce: Spencer will ditch the 
shades and saxophone and become a pugnacious cancer-fighter. 
</P>
<P>
	``I love Spencer,'' said Sue Johnson-Langdon, executive director  
of the N.C. Sweet Potato Commission. ``I loved the saxophone image. 
But it's not worth $100,000.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That's what court costs would have run had the commission  
decided to take on the California Raisin Marketing Board, she 
estimated Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The North Carolina sweet potato promoters had used Spencer as  
its marketing mascot for two years without a peep of protest. 
</P>
<P>
	But then the raisin board last fall spotted Spencer with his  
saxophone and sunglasses in two trade newspapers. It complained 
that he looked suspiciously like its raisins, which the board spent 
$100 million promoting in the late 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
	``One guise of our ex-grapes is playing the saxophone with  
high-top sneakers,'' said raisin board spokeswoman Kathy Moulthrop. 
``We have that trademarked.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The raisin board, which is considering bringing back the dancing  
raisins, warned the commission in North Carolina, the nation's 
biggest producer of sweet potatoes, to cease and desist. 
</P>
<P>
	``We never did think Spencer looked like the dancing raisin,''  
said Johnson-Langdon, but the Sweet Potato Commission decided 
Spencer's image wasn't worth diverting one-fourth of the 
commission's entire yearly budget for legal fees. 
</P>
<P>
	The raisin lawyers talked to the sweet potato lawyers, and they  
came to an understanding. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead of a saxophone, Spencer will sport boxing gloves and  
become a cancer fighter. 
</P>
<P>
	The legal paperwork should be signed in the next two weeks,  
Johnson-Langdon said. 
</P>
<P>
	Celia Batchelor, whose 1995 fourth-grade class at the former  
Elvie Street Elementary in Wilson helped persuade lawmakers to make 
the sweet potato the state vegetable, admits she thought the 
sax-playing Spencer looked like the raisins. 
</P>
<P>
	``But I thought, hey, if you can get away with it, go for it.''

<HEADLINE>  Prosecutor Investigates Bob Knight </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BLOOMINGTON, Ind. (AP) -- Bob Knight's alleged attack on a  
restaurant patron could lead to assault and battery charges. 
</P>
<P>
	In his latest tirade, Chris Foster, 38, claimed the Indiana  
basketball coach choked him in a restaurant parking lot Monday 
after Foster accused Knight of making a racist remark. 
</P>
<P>
	Monroe County Prosecutor Carl Salzmann said Thursday he's still  
gathering facts in the case and has not decided whether to file 
charges. As of early this morning, Salzmann had yet to interview 
Knight. 
</P>
<P>
	``No charges will be filed before (today) at the earliest and  
probably not until Monday,'' Salzmann told The Indianapolis Star. 
``We have a Spanish interpreter helping us interview the waiter and 
cashier at the restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
	``The other patron (Foster) has told me he wants to file  
charges, but now I want to find out what Mr. Knight would like to 
do,'' Salzmann said. 
</P>
<P>
	The prosecutor said his choices would be to file assault and  
battery charges against the 58-year-old Knight, to file provocation 
charges against Foster, or to drop the case entirely. 
</P>
<P>
	Foster claims he was at a Mexican restaurant in nearby  
Ellettsville with a friend and couldn't help hearing Knight's 
profanity-laced conversation as the coach sat with his wife and her 
two sisters in the mostly-empty room. 
</P>
<P>
	``The vast majority of all dialogue was sports-related stuff,  
baseball, basketball, names and statistics,'' Foster said. ``At one 
point, he made a comment that was basically, `When I have a black 
player who comes into some money, I tell him, `You buy your mother 
a house and you hang onto the rest of it,' because when one of 
those people comes into money, the rest of them come out of the 
woodwork.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Foster, who is white, said he spoke to Knight as they were  
paying their bills and that he told Knight he found some of his 
remarks offensive. 
</P>
<P>
	``By this time we're starting to walk out of the restaurant, so  
I repeat to him what he said, and he says, `That's not racist.' And 
I said, `Well I'm sorry, but you obviously don't understand when 
you make a racist remark.' 
</P>
<P>
	``He starts screaming at me ... I don't even know what he's  
saying, he's screaming so loud at me. I told him, `Look, calm down, 
calm down,' and he just reaches up and grabs me by the throat and 
tries to pick me up,'' Foster said. 
</P>
<P>
	Knight said he did what almost anyone else would have done under  
the circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have no question whatsoever about the fact that even my most  
severe critics, given the circumstances that I found myself in the 
other night, would not have reacted much different than I did,'' 
Knight told Indianapolis television station WTHR. 
</P>
<P>
	After the friend, Joseph Rheinhardt, 20, separated them, Foster  
went back into the restaurant and called the police. 
</P>
<P>
	``I saw him with his hand on Chris' throat. I batted his arm  
away and stepped between them. I was standing right there,'' 
Rheinhardt said. 
</P>
<P>
	After Foster called police, he went back outside and Knight was  
still there. The coach approached him again, saying, ``Do you want 
more of me?'' Foster said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rheinhardt stepped between them again.  
</P>
<P>
	``I was nose-to-nose with him. He wanted to get through me and  
to Chris,'' Rheinhardt said. ``At some point, I put my hand up and 
he said, `Don't you touch me.''' 
</P>
<P>
	The restaurant's co-owner and cashier said they didn't see what  
happened in the parking lot but didn't hear any unusually loud 
exchanges inside. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the other guy shouldn't have been listening to their  
conversation,'' co-owner Jacinto Coronel said. 
</P>
<P>
	Cashier Usiel Reyes said he was standing by the register when  
Foster confronted Knight, but neither one raised his voice. 
</P>
<P>
	A waiter also contradicted Foster's allegation, the prosecutor  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``He said that it was a pleasant, quiet evening,'' Salzmann  
said. ``The only thing he really saw outside the ordinary was a 
little girl from one of the other tables asking Bobby for his 
autograph, which he gave her. Nobody was being loud.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Foster said it is ``kind of strange'' that he might be charged  
with provoking the incident. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you just let it slide, you're tacitly approving (offensive  
remarks),'' he said. ``That's all I was trying to do. He engaged in 
the conversation with me freely. It wasn't until I told him he 
evidently didn't know a racist statement when he made one. If 
that's provoking or whatever, then I guess I did it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In 1979, Knight was tried and convicted in absentia and  
sentenced to six months in jail for hitting a Puerto Rican 
policeman at the Pan American Games. Then-Gov. Otis Bowen refused 
to extradite Knight to Puerto Rico, which dropped its attempts to 
get him back eight years later. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1981, at the NCAA finals in Philadelphia, Knight was involved  
in a hotel shoving match with a Louisiana State fan, who told 
reporters Knight stuffed him in a garbage can. In 1985, he was 
ejected from a game after throwing a chair across the court during 
a game against Purdue. 
</P>
<P>
	At the 1992 NCAA tournament, Knight playfully gave a mock  
whipping to Calbert Cheaney, a black player, during practice. 
Knight denied any racial connotations to the prank and noted the 
bullwhip he used was given to him by the players, including 
Cheaney. The Hall of Fame coach also has been suspended or fined 
several times.

<HEADLINE> Canoeist Convicted of cussing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	STANDISH, Mich. (AP) -- A man accused of unleashing a string of  
curse words after he tumbled out of his canoe last summer was 
convicted Friday of violating an 1897 ban on swearing in front of 
children. 
</P>
<P>
	Jurors in rural Arenac County, 130 miles north of Detroit,  
deliberated less than an hour before convicting Timothy Boomer, 25. 
The factory worker from the Detroit suburbs could be jailed for 90 
days. 
</P>
<P>
	Boomer did not show any reaction when the verdict was read.  
</P>
<P>
	He did not deny he let off steam after his canoe hit a rock on  
the Rifle River last summer, but he said he didn't see any children 
and that his shouts were in jest. 
</P>
<P>
	``Timothy Boomer at worst said an `f-word' or two when he fell  
into the Rifle River,'' defense attorney William Street told the 
jury in his closing statement. ``It was not the sort of event that 
has now been exaggerated and blown all out of proportion. The 
people literally are trying to make a mountain out of a molehill.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Richard Vollbach, the prosecutor, said witnesses testified  
that Boomer ``used the `f-word' at least a few dozen times with 
children present ... anywhere between 25 and, I believe, 70 times. 
They described Mr. Boomer with veins popping out of his neck; he 
was enraged.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Police began patrolling the river last summer after  
representatives of campgrounds and property owners complained that 
drunken, rowdy boaters were getting out of hand. A sheriff's deputy 
who was patrolling the Rifle River ticketed Boomer. 
</P>
<P>
	Street, who was defending Boomer on behalf of the American Civil  
Liberties Union, conceded that Boomer was part of a group that had 
been drinking beer on the river. But that didn't justify the 
cussing charge, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``As much as they would like to have been able to ticket Timothy  
Boomer for being drunk, for being disorderly, they didn't bring the 
charge because they didn't have the facts,'' Street said. ``So they 
scraped 102 years deep into the bottom of the Michigan Criminal 
Code to bring this offense to the top.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Vollbach countered: ``The defense arguments should send a chill  
up the spine of anyone who believes privacy, civility and decency 
have any place in this society.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 1897 law prohibited cursing in front of women and children,  
but the judge in this case, Allen Yenior, ruled that the reference 
to women violated the equal protection clause of the U.S. 
Constitution.

<P>
	``I think the other guy shouldn't have been listening to their  
conversation,'' co-owner Jacinto Coronel said. 
</P>
<P>
	Cashier Usiel Reyes said he was standing by the register when  
Foster confronted Knight, but neither one raised his voice. 
</P>
<P>
	A waiter also contradicted Foster's allegation, the prosecutor  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``He said that it was a pleasant, quiet evening,'' Salzmann  
said. ``The only thing he really saw outside the ordinary was a 
little girl from one of the other tables asking Bobby for his 
autograph, which he gave her. Nobody was being loud.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Foster said it is ``kind of strange'' that he might be charged  
with provoking the incident. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you just let it slide, you're tacitly approving (offensive  
remarks),'' he said. ``That's all I was trying to do. He engaged in 
the conversation with me freely. It wasn't until I told him he 
evidently didn't know a racist statement when he made one. If 
that's provoking or whatever, then I guess I did it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In 1979, Knight was tried and convicted in absentia and  
sentenced to six months in jail for hitting a Puerto Rican 
policeman at the Pan American Games. Then-Gov. Otis Bowen refused 
to extradite Knight to Puerto Rico, which dropped its attempts to 
get him back eight years later. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1981, at the NCAA finals in Philadelphia, Knight was involved  
in a hotel shoving match with a Louisiana State fan, who told 
reporters Knight stuffed him in a garbage can. In 1985, he was 
ejected from a game after throwing a chair across the court during 
a game against Purdue. 
</P>
<P>
	At the 1992 NCAA tournament, Knight playfully gave a mock  
whipping to Calbert Cheaney, a black player, during practice. 
Knight denied any racial connotations to the prank and noted the 
bullwhip he used was given to him by the players, including 
Cheaney. The Hall of Fame coach also has been suspended or fined 
several times.

	Russian Troops Are in Kosovo  
</P>
<P>
	PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- A convoy of up to 300 Russian  
soldiers rolled into the Kosovo capital of Pristina early Saturday 
to the cheering of Serb crowds, the force apparently defying what 
NATO said was an understanding that Russia not enter the province 
alone. Hours before NATO was to send its own peacekeepers into 
Kosovo, Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov said the Russian 
troops had been ordered to leave. But the Russians moved to the 
outskirts of Pristina and stopped for the night. At Stenkovec, 
Macedonia, about 400 British tanks and fighting vehicles were 
revving up and awaiting the order to move into Kosovo.

<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- Negotiators struggled Saturday to hammer out a  
compromise on how Russian troops will work with NATO peacekeepers 
in Kosovo as a column of Russian soldiers entered the province 
ahead of the alliance's forces. The ITAR-Tass news agency, 
reporting from Belgrade, said that the Russian Defense Ministry had 
made the decision to send its troops ahead of NATO peacekeepers. It 
said the move had been coordinated with the Yugoslav army supreme 
command. It was not clear whether the Russian Foreign Ministry knew 
in advance of the military's plans.

	Albright Tours Refugee Camp  
</P>
<P>
	SKOPJE, Macedonia (AP) -- Secretary of State Madeleine Albright  
assured ethnic Albanian refugees that NATO peacekeepers in Kosovo 
would help them return home ``to live a decent, normal life.'' 
Albright declared Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic and the 
Serbs have given up control of Kosovo. ``All the world knows about 
your suffering,'' she assured them. As Albright toured the 
Stenkovic camp, NATO troops made preparations to move into Kosovo 
to protect the returning ethnic Albanians. The deployments could 
begin Saturday.

<HEADLINE> eBay Crashes, Auctions Suspended </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- All bidding was suspended at eBay today  
as the giant Internet auction house struggled to rebuild a 
corrupted computer server that disrupted bidding on millions of 
collectibles and curios of all kinds. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're sorry, but the eBay system is temporarily unavailable,''  
the company said in one of many updates posted on the site since 
the latest problem began Thursday evening. ``We extend our utmost 
apologies for this inconvenience.'' 
</P>
<P>
	EBay engineers worked through the night to restore its primary  
database server, going back to computer tapes and laboriously 
transferring files. 
</P>
<P>
	``Damage to the system is more extensive than expected,'' the  
company said early Friday morning. It stressed that no data had 
been lost, and estimated that it may take until noon Friday before 
customers can bid on items again. 
</P>
<P>
	The auctions will be extended by 24 hours after service is  
restored so that nobody's bidding opportunities will be lost, the 
company said. 
</P>
<P>
	John Dodge, editor of PC Week, said the company has had ``daily  
failures every few weeks, but this one is the biggest.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Such outages are commonplace at Web sites, where the visual  
images and interactive functions computer users see are ultimately 
dependent on typewritten computer codes. A typewritten mistake in a 
key location of code can corrupt what the public sees of computer 
files that are otherwise unaffected. 
</P>
<P>
	But this is eBay, one of the top 10 businesses on the Internet,  
and every major disruption can have huge ramifications. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the worst previous outages, which lasted about six hours,  
prevented eBay from hosting auctions of just-released merchandise 
tied to the latest ``Star Wars'' movie. Customers flocked to rival 
Amazon.com. 
</P>
<P>
	A call to company representatives was not immediately returned,  
but a customer service representative who would only give her name 
as Doris said the site was receiving e-mail inquiries from 
customers. 
</P>
<P>
	The company's Internet auction site runs 24 hours a day, seven  
days a week. It lists more than 2 million items, including 
antiques, books, computers, toys and sports memorabilia that can be 
purchased through a bidding process. 
</P>
<P>
	EBay reported that the number of registered users on its site as  
of March 31 reached 3.8 million, almost double the 2.1 million 
registered users during the three-month period that ended Dec. 31, 
1998. 
</P>
<P>
	The company, which saw more than $541 million in merchandise  
auctioned off through 22.9 million separate transactions during the 
first quarter of this year, earns a percentage on each sale. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first quarter of its 1999 fiscal year, eBay reported the  
increased volume on its Web site boosted its quarterly profit to 
$5.9 million, or 5 cents per share.

<HEADLINE> Hackers Attack Senate Web Site </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Computer hackers attacked the U.S. Senate's  
main Web site Friday, the second such assault on the high-profile 
Internet page in just over two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	The hackers defaced the Web page, www.senate.gov, but left its  
overall look similar to how it normally appears. For example, they 
left untouched a link to a ``today in history'' feature but 
substituted news that ``Senator Robert F. Kennedy, D-N.Y., was 
assassinated.'' 
</P>
<P>
	They also altered the site's security notice to read, ``Security  
and lame notice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The FBI already was investigating a May 27 attack on the Web  
site. 
</P>
<P>
	``The FBI is investigating the first incident. That's under our  
purview,'' spokeswoman Debbie Weierman said. ``This current 
(attack), I can't give you a reason why it happened. Apparently, 
it's very current.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sherry Little, a spokeswoman for the Senate Sergeant at Arms  
office, which operates the Senate site, said after the May 27 
attack that technical experts planned to meet with the FBI to put 
security measures in place. 
</P>
<P>
	An obscene message left briefly on the Senate's Web site May 27  
said that attack was carried out because of what it said was the 
FBI's harassment of specific hacker groups, including the group 
that boasted of breaking into the White House site earlier.

<HEADLINE> 1st Lady Cheers Yankees in D.C. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Potential Senate candidate Hillary Rodham  
Clinton declared herself a fan of the New York Yankees and donned a 
baseball cap to show her allegiance to the pinstriped Bronx 
Bombers. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Yankees' owner said it's New York City Mayor Rudolph  
Giuliani, Mrs. Clinton's possible GOP rival in next year's Senate 
race, who's the real fan. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a great fan. They don't come any better,'' George  
Steinbrenner said after a White House ceremony Thursday to honor 
the Yankees for their World Series title last year. 
</P>
<P>
	The sudden, keen interest in sports came after Mrs. Clinton  
spent a day in upstate New York, where she was greeted with signs 
reading ``Carpetbagger Go Home.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The first lady, who has never lived in the state, in considering  
running for the seat Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan will vacate when 
he retires next year. 
</P>
<P>
	Surrounded by Yankees at the White House event Mrs. Clinton  
beamed as shortstop Derek Jeter presented her with a team pendent. 
The first lady, who grew up rooting for the Chicago Cubs, smoothed 
down her hair and gamely tugged on a Yankees cap. President Clinton 
received a pinstripe jersey. 
</P>
<P>
	But despite the warm reception, Yankees pitcher David Cone had  
to agree with Steinbrenner in the battle of the fans. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think Mayor Giuliani probably has the edge right now, he's a  
lifelong Yankees fan,'' Cone said. 
</P>
<P>
	White House officials insisted it was just a coincidence that  
the event to honor the Yankees -- who won the series almost eight 
months ago -- had come just as Mrs. Clinton prepared to form an 
exploratory committee for the Senate race.

<HEADLINE> Rosie's Son Gets Kidnap Threat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Rosie O'Donnell skipped the Tony Awards and  
stayed home with her two children after someone phoned in a 
kidnapping threat to the Howard Stern show, her spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
	The talk show host was slated to present an award with actress  
Elaine Stritch at Sunday night's show, but pulled out earlier in 
the week after an anonymous caller said he was considering 
kidnapping her 3-year-old son Parker. 
</P>
<P>
	``When somebody makes a threat to your children, your first  
instinct is to run and spend time with them, not to leave them 
alone,'' O'Donnell spokeswoman Jennifer Glaisek said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The story was first reported Wednesday in Variety.

<HEADLINE> Americans Favor 1st Lady Senate Run </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Three of four Americans think it's OK for a  
president's spouse to run for office, and more than half say 
Hillary Rodham Clinton should run for the U.S. Senate in New York, 
according to an Associated Press poll. 
</P>
<P>
	Three-quarters of Democrats were in favor of a Senate campaign  
by Mrs. Clinton, but so were half of independent voters and one in 
three Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
	The proportion of people who said she should run, 54 percent,  
was sharply lower than the 73 percent who said a president's spouse 
could appropriately run for office. But that difference was largely 
due to the attitudes of GOP voters. 
</P>
<P>
	The poll, conducted by ICR of Media, Pa., found that 65 percent  
of Republicans said seeking elective office was appropriate for a 
presidential spouse, while 34 percent said this particular 
president's wife should run. Among Democrats, 85 percent said 
running for office was appropriate in general, and 77 percent said 
Mrs. Clinton should run. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton recently said she would form an exploratory  
committee to help her decide whether to seek the Senate seat held 
by Democrat Daniel Patrick Moynihan, who is retiring. She is 
running neck and neck with New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, a 
Republican, in polls of New York voters. 
</P>
<P>
	Elizabeth Dole, a candidate for the GOP presidential nomination  
and wife of 1996 Republican nominee Bob Dole, said in an interview 
with The Associated Press this week that Mrs. Clinton should be 
able to run ``if that's what she wants to do and if the people of 
New York want her to do it. ... She's certainly a very bright lady. 
That's up to her.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The telephone poll of 1,016 American adults was taken Friday  
through Tuesday. The margin of sampling error was plus or minus 3 
percentage points. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton's approval rating stood at 58 percent in the poll.  
President Clinton got a mixed review, with 48 percent saying they 
had a favorable opinion of him and 44 percent saying their opinion 
was unfavorable. 
</P>
<P>
	``She's qualified, a smart lady. She's gone to law school. She's  
got a lot of ideas and had some nice health ideas,'' said Andrew 
Eckman, a 46-year-old manager of a comedy basketball team in 
Springfield, Mass. ``I pursue my dreams. She should be able to.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But some who thought it was appropriate for a president's spouse  
to run for office didn't want Mrs. Clinton to run for the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	``If a person grew up in a state and then came back and wanted  
to run, that would be OK,'' said Leo Wiser, a 44-year-old carpenter 
in North Charleston, S.C., who was born near Binghamton, N.Y. 
``Every time I've heard Mrs. Clinton asked about what's going on in 
New York, she gravitates towards the city. I wonder if maybe she 
should try for representative of the city.'' 
</P>
<P>
	New York polls have shown that about half the people in the  
state are at least somewhat concerned that she is not a New Yorker, 
said Lee Miringoff, director of the Marist Institute for Public 
Opinion. 
</P>
<P>
	The sentiment for Mrs. Clinton to run and the number who think  
it is appropriate for a president's spouse to run dropped for 
respondents 55 and older. 
</P>
<P>
	``She should be a writer and lecturer,'' said Elizabeth  
Smothers, a 57-year-old Republican from Boaz, Ala. ``She'd be out 
there for everybody who wanted to pay to see her, but I would never 
have to hear from her again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	About one-third of those polled said they thought Mrs. Clinton  
would be most effective as a senator, with the remainder divided on 
whether she would have more influence as the head of a foundation, 
writer and lecturer or lawyer. Women and people with lower incomes 
were more likely to think senator would be her most effective role.	   Mrs. Clinton's campaign would be ``so unique that I don't think 
it will tell us anything generally about women in politics,'' said 
Jean Bethke Elshtain, a professor of social and political ethics at 
the University of Chicago and specialist on women in politics. 
``She's a known figure, has instant recognizability and can draw on 
enormous resources from her husband's network.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some public sentiment for Mrs. Clinton now may not translate  
into political support in the New York Senate race, said Mitchell 
Moss, director of the Taub Urban Research Center at New York 
University. 
</P>
<P>
	``People are relating to her as first lady,'' he said. ``They  
are not relating to her as a candidate. Anyone who thinks you can 
run for office as first lady and maintain this kind of insularity 
is mistaken.''

<HEADLINE> Jury Awards Damages in Cobb Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- A jury today awarded Randall ``Tex''  
Cobb $2.2 million in punitive damages for a Sports Illustrated 
story saying the boxer fixed a fight and shared cocaine with the 
loser. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. District Court jury deliberated Cobb's demand for up to  
$100 million after Judge Robert Echols ruled that the panel could 
consider the financial resources of Time Inc., the magazine's 
parent, in determining the figure. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, the jury awarded Cobb $8.5 million in compensatory  
damages from Sports Illustrated. 
</P>
<P>
	When the award was announced today, Cobb shook hands with his  
attorney, who patted him on the head. 
</P>
<P>
	Cobb contended the 1993 magazine article ended his boxing career  
and nearly ended his acting career. 
</P>
<P>
	``Tex has been a prisoner of this article for six years and  
there's no better feeling in the world than to have a jury come in 
and set the record straight,'' Cobb attorney George Bochetto said.

<HEADLINE> Marlins Owner Still `Owns' Yankees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- John Henry has a lot invested in this weekend's  
series between the New York Yankees and the Florida Marlins. 
</P>
<P>
	Henry bought the Marlins for $150 million in January, and he has  
owned 1 percent of the Yankees as a limited partner since 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	The multimillionaire commodity futures trader plans to sell his  
share of the Yankees, which could be worth up to $7 million. The 
sale has been delayed by the pending merger of the Yankees and the 
NBA's New Jersey Nets, Henry said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``They have enough going on without having to deal with an  
outsider coming in,'' he said. ``There are a few friends of mine 
who would like to buy it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Henry, who received his 1998 World Series ring Thursday, said  
he's in no hurry to sell his share in the Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
	``Don't you think I should hold out until the end of the year  
and get another ring?'' he said with a smile. ``Right now I've got 
two shots to get a ring.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Yankees began the weekend series in first place in the AL  
East, while the Marlins had the worst record in the National 
League. But Henry noted that Florida had won seven of its past 
eight games. 
</P>
<P>
	``At the rate of improvement we're making, we should be in the  
World Series this year,'' he joked. ``We're only 14 games out in 
the wild-card race.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Henry watched Friday's game from his skybox with Yankees owner  
George Steinbrenner. 
</P>
<P>
	``You're lucky you've got John Henry down here as an owner,''  
Steinbrenner said. ``He's probably the smartest guy in baseball. 
I'm tied for sixth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Steinbrenner made a pitch on behalf of Henry for a new ballpark  
with a retractable roof in South Florida. Friday's game started 70 
minutes late because of the Marlins' seventh rain delay of the 
season, and they've had one game rained out. 
</P>
<P>
	``Those legislators -- they've got to give John Henry a new  
stadium,'' said Steinbrenner, who lives in Tampa. ``You can't play 
in Florida without a retractable roof.''

<HEADLINE> Tigers Activate Clark From DL </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Tony Clark was in the Detroit Tigers' lineup  
and homered in his first at-bat Friday night after being activated 
from the 15-day disabled list. 
</P>

	Clark went on the DL for the first time since 1993 on May 26,

<HEADLINE> Oil Prices Fall on Weak Demand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Weaker global demand for oil offset production  
cuts by oil exporters, causing the price of crude to drop last 
month by more than $2 per barrel, the International Energy Agency 
reported Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Oil inventories fell more slowly than expected, even though  
compliance with agreed production cuts by oil-producing countries 
improved to 90 percent from April's level of 82 percent, the agency 
said in a report faxed from its Paris headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
	Global crude production fell last month by 400,000 barrels per  
day to a new total of 73 million barrels per day. 
</P>
<P>
	However, a decline in seasonal demand for heating oil and other  
products together with uninterrupted exports from Iraq helped 
depress prices. OPEC's benchmark price for a barrel of crude 
dropped to $12.66 a barrel in May from $15 in April, the IEA said. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month's price decrease followed a $7 per barrel run-up  
during the previous 2 1/2 months. That earlier price jump resulted 
from an agreement by OPEC members and other producers to slash 
production by 2.1 million barrels per day in an effort to boost 
prices. 
</P>
<P>
	The IEA forecast that global demand for oil would rise this year  
to an average of 75 million barrels per day, an increase of 1.4 
percent above 1998. Much of the reason would be continued economic 
recovery in Asia, particularly in Japan and South Korea, it said. 
</P>
<P>
	Among OPEC's 11 members, only Nigeria, Kuwait and Algeria  
increased production in May, the IEA reported. 
</P>
<P>
	The IEA is part of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and  
Development, a group of the world' most developed nations.

<HEADLINE> Sunburn Kills Woman in Arizona </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- An 86-year-old Alzheimer's patient was left on a  
nursing home patio in the Arizona sun long enough to suffer a 
sunburn that killed her. 
</P>
<P>
	Mary Miles, a patient at the SunRise Thunderbird Care and  
Rehabilitation Center, died Sunday from burns she suffered May 18 
to her feet, legs, arms and neck. Doctors had amputated her legs in 
trying to save her. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators are trying to determine whether workers at the  
nursing home are culpable in the death. 
</P>
<P>
	Workers told state investigators that Ms. Miles was on the patio  
for an hour at most. Doctors said it would take at least several 
hours of sun exposure to get the third-degree burns she suffered, 
police said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Department of Health Services is investigating how long Ms.  
Miles was in the sun and whether she was taking any drugs that 
would have made her more sensitive to light. 
</P>
<P>
	Workers said Ms. Miles was dressed in a T-shirt, pants and  
slippers, said Judy Sgrillo, who oversees nursing home licensing 
for the agency. 
</P>
<P>
	The nursing home's parent company, New Mexico-based Sun  
Healthcare Group, expressed sympathy for Ms. Miles' family and 
pledged to cooperate with the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	``A part of what we have to do is deal with incidents like  
this,'' company spokeswoman Karen Gilliland told The Arizona 
Republic. ``It's important not to jump to conclusions when you hear 
about things. It's always more complicated than it seems.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a separate incident, the state also is looking into beatings  
suffered by two men at the nursing home during the past month. A 
probe into the November death of another patient who had severe 
bedsores could not find enough evidence to reach a conclusion, the 
department said. 
</P>
<P>
	The department investigated at least 16 other complaints of  
abuse or substandard care at the facility in the past 18 months, 
records show. Investigators ruled that one complaint was unfounded, 
referred one case of verbal abuse of patients to prosecutors and 
could not find enough evidence to rule on the other 14 complaints.

<HEADLINE> Marines Deny Vaccine Charges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TWENTYNINE PALMS, Calif. (AP) -- Five Marines who would not take  
anthrax vaccinations have pleaded innocent to charges of refusing 
to obey an order. 
</P>
<P>
	The defendants are among dozens of U.S. military personnel who  
have refused vaccinations intended to protect them in case anthrax 
is used in biological warfare. 
</P>
<P>
	The men, all lance corporals, entered their pleas Thursday  
during an initial military hearing at Twentynine Palms Marine Corps 
Air Ground Combat Center, a Mojave Desert training ground in 
southeastern California. 
</P>
<P>
	The hearing, expected to conclude today, will determine if a  
court martial will be held. 
</P>
<P>
	A Marine Corps legal expert, Maj. Steve Ockerman, said outside  
court that ``we feel the real issue here is one of discipline'' and 
a commander's ability to give orders. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense attorney Mark Zaid has said he wants to put the vaccine  
on trial, raising the issue of whether it is safe. 
</P>
<P>
	A growing number of service personnel have refused the vaccine  
due to questions about side effects, including sterility. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 220,000 service members have been immunized, according  
to the Pentagon. Forty-two reported adverse effects, including 
seven serious enough to be hospitalized or take a sick day. All 
recovered from complaints, including soreness, rashes, headaches 
and fevers, U.S. officials have said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pentagon has acknowledged that about 200 members of the  
military have balked at the immunizations. 
</P>
<P>
	Zaid, a civilian lawyer, entered innocent pleas for Jason  
Austin, 22, of Fritch, Texas; Michael McIntyre, 22, of Mount 
Vernon, Wash.; Jared Johnston, 19, of Henryetta, Okla.; Michael 
Metzig, 20, of San Diego; and Jared Schwartz, 20, Henderson, Ky.

<HEADLINE> St. Peter Seminary Moving to Neb. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENTON, Neb. (AP) -- The only Roman Catholic seminary in the  
nation still emphasizing the celebration of Mass in Latin is moving 
from Pennsylvania to a conservative Nebraska diocese whose bishop 
once ordered people excommunicated for belonging to certain 
organizations. 
</P>
<P>
	The 60-student seminary of the U.S. branch of the Priestly  
Fraternity of St. Peter has outgrown the rented motel it uses in 
Paupack, Pa. The order broke ground in October for a new seminary 
on a hill near Lincoln and plans to start classes next year. 
</P>
<P>
	The site is in the diocese led by Bishop Fabian Bruskewitz, who  
in 1996 stirred controversy by ordering Catholics to quit groups 
such as Planned Parenthood, Catholics for a Free Choice and Masonic 
organizations. He threatened them with excommunication, the 
spiritual equivalent of the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
	Many theologians criticized the decree as too broad; no other  
bishops followed his example. And the bishop himself said people 
must use their conscience to know whether they are affected; no one 
was publicly refused the sacraments. 
</P>
<P>
	The fraternity's leader, the Rev. Arnaud Devillers, said  
Bruskewitz's excommunication order did not affect his decision to 
relocate to Nebraska. But he defended the decree, saying some of 
the groups involved deceived people by claiming they were fully 
approved by the church. 
</P>
<P>
	Devillers' group serves people who dislike changes in the church  
brought about by the Second Vatican Council in the 1960s. Known as 
Vatican II, the council said that Mass should be said in local 
languages instead of Latin and that modern culture should be 
embraced. 
</P>
<P>
	The fraternity still offers Mass in Latin, with priests facing  
away from the congregation in a ceremony that stresses the mystery 
surrounding the belief that bread and wine in the Communion 
ceremony become Jesus Christ's body and blood.

<HEADLINE> American Airlines Hit With Suit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- A man injured in last week's deadly American  
Airlines crash has filed a lawsuit claiming the airline trained its 
pilots in unsafe cockpit practices. 
</P>
<P>
	Ron Pennington, 44, was aboard American Airlines Flight 1420 on  
June 1 when the plane sped off a runway while landing at the Little 
Rock, Ark., airport and crashed into the steel posts of a catwalk. 
</P>
<P>
	Ten people, including Capt. Richard Buschmann, died and more  
than 80 were injured when the plane broke up and caught fire. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit, filed Friday in a Dallas County district court,  
contends Buschmann and a co-pilot did not follow a landing 
checklist, including failing to arm the landing spoilers. 
</P>
<P>
	The suit -- which does not specify damages -- blames American  
Airlines and its parent company, AMR Corp., for adopting ``policies 
and practices which were contrary to safe cockpit resource 
management.'' 
</P>
<P>
	American Airlines spokesman Chris Chiames said he found it  
``curious'' that lawyers have determined the cause of the accident 
before the National Transportation Safety Board. 
</P>
<P>
	Three other lawsuits have been filed regarding the crash,  
including one filed in Little Rock by the family of Debra Sattari 
of Vallejo, Calif., who died in the accident. The lawsuit claims 
the airline was negligent for trying to land the plane in a storm. 
</P>
<P>
	Survivors in Chicago and Little Rock also have sued American.

<HEADLINE> Grains Lower; Soybeans Higher / Board of Trade  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Grain futures prices fell and soybean rose  
slightly in trading Friday on the Chicago Board of Trade. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts say grain traders were reacting to predictions of  
rainfall and milder temperatures across the Midwest. Such weather 
should promote early growth and potentially larger crops. 
</P>
<P>
	Farmers also are winding up the last of spring plantings.  
</P>
<P>
	Wheat also faced pressure by expected drying in winter wheat  
growing regions, which should allow harvesting of that crop to get 
back on track. 
</P>
<P>
	Soybean futures prices, while pressured by the weather, got a  
late boost when soyoil prices rallied. 
</P>
<P>
	In trading Friday, wheat for July delivery fell 1 1/4 cents to  
$2.58 1/2 a bushel; July corn fell 3 cents to 217 1/4 a bushel; July oats 
fell 3/4 cent to $1.24 a bushel; July soybeans rose 1 3/4 cents to 
$4.70 1/4 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Meat and livestock futures were mixed on the Chicago Mercantile  
Exchange.

	August live cattle rose .62 cent to 65.02 cents a pound; August  
feeder cattle rose .63 cent to 77.95 cents a pound; July lean hogs 
rose .58 cent to 53.95 cents a pound; July pork bellies fell .45

<HEADLINE> Stocks End Lower; Dow Down 130.76 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks extended a dismal week on Wall Street  
Friday, falling sharply as investors became increasingly certain 
that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates to slow down the 
robust U.S. economy. 
</P>
<P>
	While fears of a rate increase have shaken stocks for weeks,  
rumors that the Fed would boost rates higher or sooner than 
previously thought sent the market sliding in afternoon trading. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones industrial average fell 130.76 to close at  
10,490.51. The blue-chip index lost 309.33 points, or 2.9 percent, 
for the week. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators also fell. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500  
slipped 9.18 to 1,293.64, and the Nasdaq composite index fell 36.74 
to 2,447.88. 
</P>
<P>
	The fear of higher interest rates has become so pervasive on  
Wall Street that traders Friday looked past one strong indication 
that inflation has not returned to the U.S. economy. 
</P>
<P>
	In an eagerly anticipated report, the government said the  
Producer Price Index rose only 0.2 percent last month. The index, 
which measures inflation before it reaches the consumer, was 
expected to offer an indication of whether the Fed will raise 
interest rates at its next policy-making meeting, scheduled for 
June 29 and 30. 
</P>
<P>
	But Friday afternoon, a pair of rumors swept through the uneasy  
stock and bond markets. Word spread that the Fed had convened a 
special, early meeting to debate a rate increase. Some traders also 
cited a rumor that Tiger Management LLC, a hedge fund, was about to 
fail and was seeking help from the Fed. 
</P>
<P>
	A Fed spokesman declined to comment, but traders said both  
rumors were quickly refuted. Nonetheless, the damage was done. The 
yield on the 30-year Treasury bond soared to 6.16, its highest 
level since November 1997, pulling any willing buyers away from 
stocks. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're at such a tenuous level in the marketplace that rumors  
were all it took,'' said Arthur Hogan, chief market analyst at 
Jefferies &AMP; Co. 
</P>
<P>
	Coupled with the rumors, the fragile state of the morning rally  
led investors to focus on two less favorable barometers of the 
current interest rate climate. 
</P>
<P>
	The Commerce Department reported that retail sales -- which  
represent about a third of the nation's economic output -- rose 1 
percent in May, extending a long string of gains. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, the University of Michigan's consumer sentiment  
index rose to better-than-expected levels, showing that Americans 
remain upbeat thanks to the strong U.S. economy. 
</P>
<P>
	The signs of economic strength helped convince some market  
watchers that the Fed may raise rates more than the 
quarter-percentage point that most anticipate, perhaps over the 
course of several months. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Fed could conceivably take back all three of its rate cuts  
from last year,'' said David M. Jones, chief economist at Aubrey G. 
Lanston &AMP; Co. in New York. ``People began to speculate about 
multiple rate hikes, and that was too much for the stock market to 
take.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Internet shares were mostly lower. CMGI tumbled 11 3/4 to close at  
89 3/4 after the Internet holding company announced 
higher-than-expected third-quarter losses. EBay, the online 
auctioneer, plunged 16 13/16 to 165 7/8 after its system crashed, 
forcing it to halt operations. 
</P>
<P>
	Dow components were lower across the board, with  
Hewlett-Packard, down 4 5/8 to 88 3/8, posting the sharpest decline. 
</P>
<P>
	Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 4-to-3 margin on the  
New York Stock Exchange, where composite volume totaled 838.67 
million shares, compared to 853.38 million in the previous session. 
Lack of volume contributed to the sharpness of the price swings. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index fell 3.35 to 619.50, and the American  
Stock Exchange composite index fell 2.43 to 765.82. The Russell 
2000 index of smaller companies fell 4.26 to 438.01. 
</P>
<P>
	Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average rose 0.56 percent.  
European markets were higher, as Germany's DAX index rose 1.8 
percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 gained 1.3 percent, and France's 
CAC-40 closed 0.1 percent higher.

<HEADLINE> Senate Leaders List Modest Assets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Senate's leaders are far wealthier than  
most Americans but men of modest means compared with some of their 
rank-and-file colleagues, financial records revealed today. 
</P>
<P>
	Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., and Minority Leader Tom  
Daschle, D-S.D., both own rental property, mutual funds and stocks, 
but are hardly in the multimillionaires' club. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither are assistant Democratic leader Harry Reid of Nevada nor  
Lott deputy Sen. Don Nickles of Oklahoma, although Reid has a 
substantial real estate portfolio and Nickles was busy in 1998 
buying and selling investments. 
</P>
<P>
	In an annual ritual that reveals where lawmakers invest their  
assets and earn any non-congressional income, financial disclosure 
forms are publicly released and then scrutinized by reporters. The 
Senate forms are out today, the House disclosures next Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Since congressional rules do not require net worth statements,  
the value of holdings and non-congressional income is only 
expressed in broad ranges. 
</P>
<P>
	Compared with most Americans, a lawmaker's income is large. The  
rank-and-file salary is $136,700, with floor leaders earning 
$151,800 and the speaker of the House $175,400. 
</P>
<P>
	For some their government salary is only a fraction of their  
income. Among the wealthiest senators are John D. Rockefeller IV, 
D-W.Va., Herb Kohl, D-Wis., Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., and Frank 
Lautenberg, D-N.J. 
</P>
<P>
	Many lawmakers have working spouses, most invest in stocks and  
mutual funds, and a substantial number have real estate holdings -- 
some of them earning rental income. 
</P>
<P>
	Daschle listed a portfolio of two-dozen mutual funds, but only  
one reached the $50,001 to $100,000 range in 1998. The others were 
in the $15,001-$50,000 category or the lower, $1,001-$15,000 range. 
</P>
<P>
	The Democratic leader, whose wife is a lobbyist, also owns two  
rental apartments in Washington's Virginia suburbs and one in Sioux 
Falls, S.D. -- each worth between $50,001 and $100,000 and producing 
$5,001-$15,000 in income. 
</P>
<P>
	Lott's major assets include a one-half partnership in six rental  
apartments in Mississippi worth with a combined value of 
$50,001-$100,000, three investment funds worth between $1,001 and 
$15,000 and 161 unimproved acres in his home state worth between 
$50,001 and $100,000. Most of the family assets are in Lott's 
wife's name and all were valued at $50,000 and under. 
</P>
<P>
	Nickles had a busy trading year, with 15 investment purchases  
and 15 sales. The purchases included Citigroup, Coca-Cola, Compaq 
Computer Corp., Johnson &AMP; Johnson, McDonalds and Parker Drilling 
Co. 
</P>
<P>
	Reid listed a $500,001-$1 million partnership interest in a  
company that owns a Las Vegas office building, while other real 
estate holdings could be worth more than $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
	In contrast to the leaders' holdings, Lautenberg is still  
reaping huge financial rewards from Automatic Data Processing, the 
payroll services company he co-founded. His shares in ADP are worth 
between $5 million and $25 million. 
</P>
<P>
	He has a blind trust valued between $5 million and $25 million  
and a second valued between $1 million and $5 million. Together, 
they produced income of more than $5 million in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Like Lautenberg, Sen. Slade Gorton, R-Wash., has a blind trust,  
valued between $250,001 and $500,000. His holdings in Slade Gorton 
&AMP; Co., a wholesale fish packer, are valued between $1 million and 
$5 million. 
</P>
<P>
	But even Lautenberg's fortune pales next to Rockefeller's three  
blind trusts -- one worth more than $50 million, another valued 
between $25 million and $50 million and a third between $5 million 
and $25 million. The most valuable trust earned between $1,000,001 
and $5 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The West Virginia Democrat listed one liability, between a  
half-million and $1 million, with a Charleston bank. 
</P>
<P>
	Kohl, owner of the Milwaukee Bucks basketball team, reported a  
blind trust worth more than $50 million -- mostly in real estate 
investments in Milwaukee. The trust earned more than $5 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Kohl listed nearly $27.5 million in gross receipts from the NBA  
franchise, which is valued at more than $50 million. He has a horse 
breeding ranch in Kelly, Wyo., reporting $68,100 in income from 
horse sales. 
</P>
<P>
	While some senators have major real estate investments, Sen.  
Blanche Lincoln, D-Ark., and her husband have their 40 acres in 
Cleburne County, Ark., valued between $15,001 and $50,000. She also 
has shares in the Sandy Slough Hunting Club in her state, with the 
same valuation; and a piece of her family's Arkansas farm, Green 
Acres, valued between $100,001 and $250,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Among freshmen, Sen. Peter Fitzgerald, R-Ill. listed holdings  
between $25.6 million and $51.5 million. The vast majority is in 
Bank of Montreal stock he inherited after his father sold his 
suburban Chicago banking empire. 
</P>
<P>
	Another first-year senator, former Rep. and Hall of Fame pitcher  
Jim Bunning, R-Ky., earned $34,884 from sports shows and other 
memorabilia activities. Bunning received a waiver to accept his 
trip from Major League Baseball to Cooperstown last July for the 
annual Hall of Fame induction ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., owns one-third of a cottage in  
Ireland valued at $50,001 to $100,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Ernest Hollings, D-S.C., age 77, has one of the longest  
held plots of land among senators: a half-interest in a Charleston 
lot that he bought for $883 in April 1935. No current value is 
listed. 
</P>
<P>
	But that wasn't the only small sum disclosed. Retiring Sen.  
Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y., barely made enough for a few 
expensive Washington dinners with his royalties on four scholarly 
books. ``Pandemonium'' -- about the relations of ethnic groups -- 
brought in $195. The other three earned $151, $123 and $75. 
</P>
<P>
	With stringent Senate rules in place against accepting items of  
value, few senators listed any gifts. An exception was Sen. Robert 
Torricelli, D-N.J., who received a ticket to the U.S. Open tennis

	OMAHA, Neb. (AP) -- In high school, Jason Jennings was a catcher.  
In college, he became Baylor's ace pitcher and the Bears' top 
hitter. And on Thursday, Jennings was named Baseball America's 
player of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	Jennings, selected as the 16th overall pick in last week's  
amateur draft by the Colorado Rockies, also was named player of the 
year by Collegiate Baseball. 
</P>
<P>
	Baylor coach Steve Smith touted Jennings' skills as a cleanup  
hitter and a pitcher. Jennings hit .368 with 17 home runs and 68 
RBIs this spring and was 13-2 with a 2.58 ERA. The Rockies want him 
as a pitcher. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been a two-way player my whole life,'' he said. ``But  
from here on out, I'll be a pitcher. I'm looking forward to it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Smith said he is looking forward to the day when the Rockies let  
Jennings hit. 
</P>
<P>
	``Jason is a great, great pitcher, but he is a hitter. They're  
never going to be able to take that out of him,'' Smith said. ``I'd 
like to see the look on the opposing pitcher's face when he leans 
back and plants his foot ... and opens up that wide stance. I think 
he's going to take some people by surprise.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If pitching -- and hitting -- don't work out in Colorado, Jennings  
said he has another alternative. 
</P>
<P>
	``I loved being a catcher,'' he said. ``If for some reason  
pitching doesn't work out, maybe I can ... make a last-gasp effort 
to be a catcher.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------

<P>
	 *SWEET 64:* The expanded NCAA tournament, from 48 to 64 teams,  
drew raves from the College World Series' eight coaches. 
</P>
<P>
	``The teams here are the hottest teams,'' Stanford coach Mark  
Marquess said. ``That's because of the new format. You can have one 
or two hot weekends and get here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Oklahoma State coach Tom Holliday said the expanded format, in  
which 64 teams vie for the trip to Omaha at regional and then super 
regional sites, made the road to the CWS more difficult. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a tougher road than it has been in the last 19 or 20  
years,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The new setup is fantastic,'' Marquess said. ``It's going to  
create more interest in our great game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cal State-Fullerton coach George Horton had complained after the  
Titans didn't land a super regional site. On Thursday, he said he 
welcomed the new system. 
</P>
<P>
	``For their first time through, they (the NCAA) did a fabulous  
job,'' Horton said. ``The right guys are here at this point in the 
season.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Seven of the top eight teams in the NCAA tournament reached the  
College World Series. The exception was Oklahoma State, whch was 
seeded second in the Wichita, Kan., regional. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *GLASS HOUSES:* The four Cal State-Fullerton players suspended  
from their team's super regionals for throwing rocks watched the 
series at home, on television and in uniform, Horton said. 
</P>
<P>
	Horton said he made the players -- who include pitcher Adam  
Johnson, scheduled to start Saturday against Stanford -- break the 
news of their suspensions to their teammates. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a very emotional meeting,'' he said. ``The players  
promised to continue the season so they (the suspended players) 
could play again with the team. They met the rest of the team at 
the airport and there were tears and hugs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Horton said the incident had received too much publicity,  
however, and the Titans are eager to get back to business. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's behind us now,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Johnson, pitcher Marco Hanlon and infielders David Bacani and  
Chad Olszanski were suspended after throwing stones at cars during 
the team's regionals in South Bend, Ind. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *DEATH BY DOGPILE:* It is a football school, after all.  
</P>
<P>
	Three Florida State players were injured -- including freshman  
pitcher Blair Varnes, who tore a knee ligament -- during a 
celebration after the Seminoles' come-from-behind super regional 
victory over Auburn. 
</P>
<P>
	Pitcher Nick Stocks was kicked in the face, and the resulting  
swelling was deemed to be a glandular problem that required 
medication. A backup catcher's hand was injured and swelled. 
</P>
<P>
	``Other than that, it was a pretty good night,'' coach Mike  
Martin said. 
</P>
<P>
	Martin said Kevin Cash missed the super regionals -- and the  
treacherous victory celebration -- after he was hit in the eye 
during batting practice. He has been cleared to play in the College 
World Series.

<HEADLINE> Thomaston Mills To Cut 700 Jobs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	THOMASTON, Ga. (AP) -- Thomaston Mills Inc. plans to cut 700  
jobs, including 145 in Zebulon, Ga., in a restructuring announced 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Neil H. Hightower, president and chief executive officer, said  
the changes, effective Sept. 1, will enable the company ``to better 
focus on those markets deemed most profitable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Thomaston Mills will concentrate on the home furnishings and  
piece-dyed markets, while getting out of the industrial, sales yarn 
and denim markets. 
</P>
<P>
	Hightower said the decision on markets was ``necessary due to  
the continued influx of imports into our domestic markets and the 
uncertainties relative to the Asian financial crisis and the World 
Trade Organization.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Thomaston, Ga.-based company employes 2,350 people, though  
it is unclear how many of the job cuts will results in layoffs. Job 
cuts will also occur in the company's New York and Los Angeles 
sales offices.

<HEADLINE>  Albright Arrives in Macedonia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SKOPJE, Macedonia (AP) -- Secretary of State Madeleine Albright  
praised American troops preparing today to move into Kosovo as 
peacekeepers and assured refugees they would soon be able to return 
home ``to live a decent normal life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Addressing the troops, Albright said, ``The country you will be  
freeing has gone through some dreadful times. I know this is not 
easy on you. We are deeply honored to have you do this. You are 
bringing in a new history.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Albright was surprised when she arrived in Macedonia and heard  
reports that Russian troops were moving toward Kosovo. But she 
received assurances from Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov that 
the troop movement was just a preliminary step and the Russians 
would not deploy into Kosovo until arrangements were worked out, 
her spokesman James P. Rubin said. He also said the Russians 
understand there will be a unified command under NATO for the 
eventual 50,000 peacekeepers. 
</P>
<P>
	Albright was told of the movement by British Lt. Gen. Michael  
Jackson, commander of NATO troops in Macedonia, and then talked by 
telephone with Ivanov. 
</P>
<P>
	Albright ordered Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott to  
return to Moscow immediately. Talbott, who had been in Moscow 
discussing arrangements for the participation of the Russians in 
peacekeeping, was en route to Brussels. 
</P>
<P>
	In Washington, National Security Adviser Sandy Berger was  
optimistic. ``I think they'll work it out,'' Berger said. 
</P>
<P>
	Later, Albright visited camp Stenkovic I, the first refugee camp  
established here and a tent city that's home to about 25,000 
refugees, many of them children. 
</P>
<P>
	Albright counseled against vengeance and said the goal was a  
multi-ethnic democracy in Kosovo. But she also acknowledged the 
task was awesome and said many of the refugees may not be able to 
get home before the onset of winter. 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement to hundreds of refugees crowded behind a rope,  
Albright said ``we want you to rebuild. We want you to go home. But 
be very careful, there are land mines. All the world knows about 
your suffering, they know you want to go home and have a normal 
life. You will go home and be able to live a decent normal life and 
do it your way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After meeting with Gen. Jackson, she was taken by motorcade to  
Camp Able Sentry, a base for U.S. troops preparing to go into 
Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will have to do some winterizing of the tents in the  
camps,'' Albright said before departing for Macedonia to visit 
refugees and consult with government leaders. ``We can't count on 
everyone getting back before the weather.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, Albright said, investigators, possibly  
including the FBI, want to get to Kosovo as quickly as possible 
before evidence of atrocities is destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
	In all, 400,000 uprooted civilians are in Kosovo, another  
500,000 are in Albania, about 200,000 are in Macedonia and others 
are scattered in Hungary and elsewhere, Albright said. Many were 
stripped of their identity papers, complicating their return. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier Thursday, trying to rally international support to  
rebuild Southeastern Europe, Albright said, ``It is time to bust 
the ghost of the Balkans past and build a new reality'' with 
reconstruction and democracy. 
</P>
<P>
	Albright and the foreign ministers of seven other world powers,  
including Russia, ended four days of talks dominated by Kosovo. 
They met with foreign ministers of the Balkan nations to sign a 
stability pact aimed at helping all countries in the region 
economically and ultimately bringing them into the European 
political fold. 
</P>
<P>
	They agreed the Europeans would bear most of the financial  
burden after the United States took the lead in winning the war. 
``Southeast Europe is a part of Europe. It is our priority,'' 
German Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to be expensive,'' Albright said, but she offered  
no estimate of the cost. Whatever it is, rebuilding is ``our gift 
to the next generation,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Although both Albright and Fischer denounced Yugoslav President  
Slobodan Milosevic -- Fischer said Milosevic had pursued a ``fascist 
policy'' -- there were no calls for revenge, and Kosovo Serbs were 
urged to stay. 
</P>
<P>
	``Revenge is not appropriate,'' Albright said. ``We would like  
Kosovo to become a multi-ethnic society.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Albright likened the task to the Marshall Plan, which helped  
rebuild Western Europe after World War II, and efforts to bring 
prosperity to Eastern Europe since the fall of communism. 
</P>
<P>
	``We do not want the conflict now ending in Kosovo to be the  
prelude to others,'' she told representatives of more than 30 
nations as NATO suspended the bombing of Yugoslavia. ``We want to 
build the true basis for a new era of peace.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fischer spoke hopefully of the ``end of the Yugoslav wars''  
after nearly a decade of bloodshed. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want all countries in the region to develop toward an  
integrated Europe,'' said Fischer, who chaired the meetings as 
leader of the host nation.

<HEADLINE> Wash. Gasoline Fire Kills Three </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BELLINGHAM, Wash. (AP) -- Thousands of gallons of gasoline leaked  
from a pipeline into a creek and somehow exploded in a huge 
fireball, killing three people, including two boys who had been 
playing nearby. 
</P>
<P>
	One dying boy told a friend he ``didn't want his mother to  
know'' he had been hurt. 
</P>
<P>
	The fire spewed thick black smoke up to 30,000 feet in the air  
Thursday over the region 90 miles northwest of Seattle. Its cause 
was not immediately known, because the scene was still too hot to 
day for investigators to examine it. 
</P>
<P>
	``It looked like Mount St. Helens!'' said Michele Higgins of the  
Whatcom County Division of Emergency Management. 
</P>
<P>
	A body was found late Thursday along Whatcom Creek, said Sheriff  
Dale Brandland. No details were immediately available. 
</P>
<P>
	Two 10-year-old boys who had been playing near the creek, Wade  
King and Stephen Tsiorvas, suffered second- and third-degree burns 
over 90 percent of their bodies. They both died this morning at 
Harborview Medical Center in Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
	They apparently jumped into the creek to stop the burning, said  
Stephen's 15-year-old brother, Andrew. They were so badly burned, 
Andrew said, that he didn't know whether he should allow them to 
see each other. 
</P>
<P>
	``Wade didn't want his mother to know,'' he said. ``He said  
she'd be too sad and mad at him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At least two other people were treated for smoke inhalation.  
</P>
<P>
	Police and fire officials had responded to reports of a gasoline  
smell about 4:45 p.m. Thursday when they were rocked by the blast. 
The explosion sparked two house fires, destroying one of the homes. 
Secondary fires continued burning into the night. 
</P>
<P>
	``It sounded a `Whoosh!' and then I looked left and I was  
standing right in front of the fire,'' said Fred Wefer, Lake Samish 
Fire Department chief. ``I've seen lots of fires, but nothing like 
that. It was a pretty scary sight.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Initially, the leak was estimated at nearly 300,000 gallons, but  
Olympic Pipe Line Co. spokeswoman Joann Hamick said today that it 
had been revised downward to around 84,000 gallons. Even so, the 
accident was one of the worst involving a fuel pipeline in state 
history. 
</P>
<P>
	The line had been shut down at 3:25 p.m. while the company  
investigated some computer errors. Employees tried to restart the 
line at 4:32 but found no pressure in the line, indicating a leak. 
</P>
<P>
	A worker doing routine monitoring of the pipeline reported  
smelling gasoline a few minutes later. He then called to report the 
explosion and fire and said he was running from the scene, Hamick 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The 400-mile pipeline carries gasoline, diesel and jet fuel from  
refineries in Whatcom and Skagit counties to Portland, Ore. 
</P>
<P>
	Monica Moriel-Gregory, a shipping coordinator at nearby Grizzly  
Imports Co., where windows were broken out, said employees heard 
about the gasoline spill at 4:40 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
	``They kept talking about how you could smell it in the  
office,'' she said. ``But no one said, 'Grab your stuff and 
leave.''' She happened to be leaving in her car when the blast 
happened. 
</P>
<P>
	Hamick said the pipeline had been retrofitted with containment  
devices to prevent this sort of accident, and officials don't know 
why they didn't work. ``As far as we can tell all of our systems 
were operating as they were supposed to,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Tyson Gets OK To Train in Arizona </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- The welcome mat is out for Mike Tyson.  
</P>
<P>
	The former heavyweight champion was granted permission to train  
in Arizona for a fight in Nevada, possibly in August, officials in 
Arizona and Maryland confirmed Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm sure he's looking forward to getting back into training  
and boxing,'' said Paul Kemp, a lawyer for Tyson. 
</P>
<P>
	Kemp said he does not know when Tyson plans to leave for  
Arizona. He must arrive at least by Monday, when he is to report to 
the Maricopa County Adult Probation Department in Phoenix, said 
John MacDonald, communications officer for the Arizona Supreme 
Court. 
</P>
<P>
	No matter to Ricky Ricardo, who helps run the downtown Phoenix  
gym where Tyson trains. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're already putting up a banner that says ``Welcome Back to  
The Community, Mike Tyson,'' he told The Arizona Republic on 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson, who was released last month and will be on probation  
until February, pleaded no contest to misdemeanor assault charges 
that stemmed from a fender bender in Gaithersburg, Md., last 
August. Tyson will continue with anger management counseling, as 
well as meeting his community service requirements, while in 
Arizona, Maryland corrections officials said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	The boxer last fought in Jan. 16 and was behind on all three  
cards before he knocked out Francois Botha in the fifth round at 
Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson also served three years in Indiana on a rape conviction.  
He registered in Arizona as a sex offender last fall when he 
decided to make Phoenix his home. He also has a home with his wife 
in Maryland. 
</P>
<P>
	Ricardo's father, Richard Rodriquez, who also helps run the  
Phoenix gym, said he has an extra reason for welcoming Tyson. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson put up money to enable the gym to remain in operation,  
Rodriquez said. It serves about 60 amateurs. 
</P>
<P>
	``He kept me alive,'' Rodriquez said.

<HEADLINE> Saying 'I do' To Wedding Insurance / On the Money  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A trip to the altar is one of the most important  
-- and expensive -- journeys in a person's life, often requiring 
loads of planning and financial resources to get there. 
</P>
<P>
	But what happens if the reception hall suddenly shuts down, the  
bridal shop holding the wedding party's gowns goes belly-up, or the 
groom has an attack of acute appendicitis just before the ceremony? 
</P>
<P>
	More than likely, the big event will have to be postponed,  
possibly at great loss to whomever is paying for it -- unless 
special insurance coverage was taken out ahead of time. 
</P>
<P>
	With the average cost of a wedding now at around $20,000, more  
and more people are obtaining insurance to protect themselves from 
unforeseen disasters, industry experts say. Coverage also is being 
taken out more frequently for expensive special events, like bar 
mitzvahs, anniversary parties or family reunions. 
</P>
<P>
	In some cases, the facilities and reception halls themselves are  
requiring party-givers to purchase extra liability coverage. 
</P>
<P>
	``More people in this economic age have the resources to  
celebrate in style, and as a result, they also see the downside if 
they need to cancel or postpone,'' says John Kozero, spokesman for 
Fireman's Fund Insurance Co. in Novato, Calif., currently the only 
carrier to offer private event coverage for individuals. 
</P>
<P>
	The policy is offered exclusively through R.V. Nuccio &AMP;  
Associates Insurance Brokers Inc. in Fawnskin, Calif., though other 
brokers around the country are permitted to sell it. It appears 
under three registered trademarks: Weddingsurance, 
Barmitzvahsurance and Celebrationsurance. 
</P>
<P>
	Is it for everyone? While insurance brokers think many people  
can benefit, Robert Hunter, director of insurance for the Consumer 
Federation of America in Washington, says it's probably an 
unnecessary expense for many. Risks are usually low and they're 
controllable, he says. Besides, there often are other recourses to 
pursue -- you could sue the photographer who failed to show up or 
the dress shop owner who shut down. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Kozero says special occasion insurance, common in Britain  
and around in the United States since 1993, has been gaining in 
popularity since it was revamped more than a year ago to include 
events besides weddings. Volume of such policies has doubled this 
past year alone, he says, though declining to provide specific 
figures. 
</P>
<P>
	Included in Fireman's basic policy -- which carries a one-time  
premium starting at $195 for $3,000 worth of coverage and a $250 
deductible -- is coverage for cancellation and postponement of the 
event itself. Coverage of nonrefundable expenses can begin up to 
two years prior to the special event. 
</P>
<P>
	Some examples of what cancelable circumstances may be covered:  
</P>
<P>
	The bride, groom or someone essential to a special event gets  
sick; the reception hall is closed down; bad weather prevents most 
of the guests from attending the event; the clergy fails to show 
up. 
</P>
<P>
	There's also separate coverage available for a range of  
potential problems: the photographer loses all the negatives and 
the photos have to be retaken; someone runs off with all the gifts; 
the bridal shop owner goes out of business and the gown has to be 
replaced; or a drunken guest damages the hall or hurts someone in a 
fist-fight. 
</P>
<P>
	What happens if the bride runs off with the best man the day  
before the wedding? 
</P>
<P>
	``One of the things that isn't covered is cold feet. We have no  
control over change of heart,'' says Robert Nuncio, owner of R.V. 
Nuccio &AMP; Associates, who has seen numerous claims. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the more amusing claims involved a wedding that had to be  
called off because the bride's gown was severely damaged. It seems 
the young woman's little brother decided her dress was too drab, so 
he finger-painted all over it. 
</P>
<P>
	Then there was the time the bride's cat decided to have kittens  
on the train of her gown. The wedding went on, but the gown had to 
be repaired. 
</P>
<P>
	More tragically, one reception had to be canceled because the  
groom's father died in an accident on his way down to the wedding. 
</P>
<P>
	The purpose of insurance is to protect individuals from  
financial losses due to such unforeseen events, notes Jeanne 
Salvatore, spokeswoman for the Insurance Information Institute in 
New York. 
</P>
<P>
	While wedding or special event insurance isn't for everyone, she  
says, it should be considered by those who have a lot of money 
invested in a particular event and stand to suffer great losses 
should something go wrong. 
</P>
<P>
	Homeowners and renters policies offer only limited coverage, she  
says.

<HEADLINE> Sweepstakes Co. Violated Agreement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) -- A federal judge found American Family  
Publishers in contempt for violating a deal in which the company 
agreed to tone down its contest promotions mailed to North Carolina 
households. 
</P>
<P>
	Chief U.S. District Judge Terrence W. Boyle found the  
sweepstakes company in civil contempt of a 1993 settlement that 
ended a lawsuit against the company's practices. 
</P>
<P>
	The settlement stipulated that American Family Publishers would  
stop using ``language of congratulations or other prizewinning 
declarations which, when considered in context ... represents that 
the recipient of the envelope has won a prize.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The judge's order became public Monday. A hearing to address  
potential damages will be held June 29 in Elizabeth City. 
</P>
<P>
	Spokeswomen for the Jersey City, N.J., company and its Raleigh  
attorneys did not immediately return phone calls seeking comment 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The envelope Attorney General Mike Easley found objectionable  
stated: ``If you have the winning number, please be advised ... 
IT'S DOWN TO A 2 PERSON RACE FOR $11,000,000 -- YOU AND ONE OTHER 
PERSON IN N. CAROLINA WERE ISSUED THE WINNING NUMBER (number) -- 
WHOEVER RETURNS IT FIRST WINS IT ALL!'' 
</P>
<P>
	The company had argued that the lead-in phrase in uncapitalized  
type qualified the conditions to be a sweepstakes winner and showed 
it was abiding by the settlement. Boyle said he didn't buy it. 
</P>
<P>
	Sweepstakes firms defended their industry at a congressional  
hearing in March, saying most Americans understand that no purchase 
is needed to win. Congress is considering a bill that would levy 
stiff fines against companies that mislead consumers.

	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The Los Angeles Dodgers purchased the  
contract of outfielder Brent Cookson from their Triple A farm club 
Friday and designated infielder Chance Sanford for assignment. 
</P>
<P>
	Cookson hit .335 with 18 homers and 48 RBIs in 55 games for  
Albuquerque of the Pacific Coast League this season. He signed a

<HEADLINE> Former QB Thanks NY Legislators </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Two years after revealing that his infant  
son suffers from a debilitating disease, former Buffalo Bills 
quarterback Jim Kelly returned to the state Capitol to thank 
lawmakers for supporting medical research into the illness. 
</P>
<P>
	Hunter Kelly has Krabbe's disease, a degenerative disorder of  
the nervous system. It starts in the brain and impairs motor 
skills. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997, the state Legislature allocated $25,000 for the  
Institute for Basic Research on Staten Island to study the illness 
after Kelly made a personal appeal for the financing. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now, there is no treatment,'' Kelly said Thursday. But  
he said researchers were making progress and a cure would one day 
be found. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no doubt,'' he said. ``And we're going to keep working  
until there is.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kelly has helped raise more than $3 million for Krabbe's  
(pronounced Kra-BAZE) research with his Hunter's Hope Foundation.

<HEADLINE> US To Test European Egg Products </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- No egg products from Belgium, France or the  
Netherlands, or animal feed made anywhere in Europe, can enter the 
United States without special safety testing, the government 
ordered Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Belgian beef, poultry, pork, milk and byproducts were banned by  
most nations, including the United States, last week after it was 
discovered that large quantities had been contaminated by 
cancer-causing dioxin. The contamination apparently was caused by 
dioxin-laced animal feed. 
</P>
<P>
	The Food and Drug Administration, which oversees the safety of  
certain imported foods, had ordered eggs detained at the U.S. 
border in certain circumstances, too. But Friday's action upgrades 
that safeguard, the FDA said. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the tightened policy, importers would have to conduct  
certain special laboratory tests proving their products were not 
contaminated with dioxin or other carcinogens known as PCBs before 
they could be sold. 
</P>
<P>
	Aside from Belgium, the FDA added egg products from France and  
the Netherlands, and animal feed, pet food and animal feed 
ingredients from any European country because of questions about 
where the originally contaminated products were shipped. 
</P>
<P>
	The FDA called the move a precaution, calling it unlikely that  
U.S. consumers were exposed to harmful chemical levels.

<HEADLINE> Winter Wheat Output Falls 14 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Winter wheat production is down 14 percent  
from last year, primarily because of sharp drops in Kansas and 
other Southern Plains states, the Agriculture Department said 
today. 
</P>
<P>
	The nation's orange crop also is off sharply, down 28 percent  
from last year's record of 13.7 million tons. Florida's production 
is down 20 percent, while California's is off by half. 
</P>
<P>
	A steep drop in wheat prices last year spurred many farmers to  
turn to other crops. 
</P>
<P>
	Farmers are expected to harvest 36 million acres of winter wheat  
nationwide this year, 1 percent less than USDA forecast a month 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Production in Kansas is down nearly 100 million bushels this  
year, to 395.6 million. Production in Oklahoma is off 50 million

<HEADLINE> Intersex Mice Found at Calif. Refuge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS BANOS, Calif. (AP) -- Something strange is happening to the  
rodents at a Northern California wildlife area where thousands of 
birds were poisoned by toxic runoff from farms years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Both male and female reproductive organs were found in one-third  
of the 87 field mice, house mice, harvest mice and California voles 
trapped last year on land that once collected toxic runoff at the 
Kesterson National Wildlife Refuge. 
</P>
<P>
	Just 3 percent of rodents trapped there showed such  
characteristics in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	``The number of intersex mammals was a surprising finding to  
everybody,'' said Michael Delamore, chief of the U.S. Bureau of 
Reclamation's drainage program in Fresno. ``We're not sure what it 
means, because it's new, and the phenomenon hasn't been widely 
reported.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Technically, the rodents seem to be pseudo-hermaphroditic,  
according to biologist Gary Santolo, who led the investigation. 
They appear to be males from the outside, and lack a vagina, but 
have a fully developed set of female organs internally. 
</P>
<P>
	Some scientists say something in the environment is causing the  
outbreak. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's fair to say that if it happened in four species and  
happened suddenly, it's indicative of an environmental cause of 
some sort,'' agreed Dr. Richard Auchus, an endocrinologist at the 
University of California at San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
	Animals in the area have been monitored yearly since an  
investigation in 1985 revealed that selenium, a byproduct of 
agricultural runoff, was killing or deforming thousands of birds. 
</P>
<P>
	Massive quantities of selenium, pesticides and other toxic  
chemicals were being deposited in the refuge in ponds that served 
as a sump for farm runoff. The ponds have since been closed and 
filled in at a cost of $50 million. The refuge no longer 
encompasses the ponds. 
</P>
<P>
	Selenium is not believed to be the cause of the hermaphroditic  
rodents. All of them had elevated levels of the element in their 
livers, but studies of selenium's effect on lab mice have not 
induced similar deformities.

	Stocks End Lower; Dow Down 130.76  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks fell sharply today, extending a dismal  
week on Wall Street, as investors became increasingly certain that 
the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates to slow down the 
robust U.S. economy. While fears about a rate increase have shaken 
stocks for weeks, rumors that the Fed would boost rates higher or 
sooner than previously thought sent the market sliding in afternoon 
trading. The Dow Jones industrial average was down 130.76 at 
10,490.51. The blue-chip index fell 309.33 points, or 2.9 percent, 
for the week. Broader stock indicators also fell, with the

	Computer Crash Halts eBay Auctions  
</P>
<P>
	SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- All bidding was suspended at eBay today  
as the so-called ``personal trading community'' with more than 3 
million users in 50 countries struggled to rebuild a corrupted 
computer server. The halt, which came after eBay tried to launch a 
revamped version of its site, disrupted bidding on millions of 
collectibles and curios, from military medals to mandolins. Bidding 
was stopped yesterday around 11 p.m. EDT and was not expected to 
start up again until later today. The company's stock has been 
traded publicly since late September, and its stock rocketed to 
$234 by April, but has since fallen by more than 20 percent. News 
of the outage sent it tumbling today, down 16 13/16 at 165 7/8.

	FBI Probes Computer E-Mail Bug  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The FBI today tried to trace the source of a  
file-destroying software bug that has hit tens of thousands of 
computers, while software companies posted new virus-killing 
programs on their Web sites. The Worm.Explore.Zip bug disguises 
itself as a friendly piece of e-mail, similar to the recent Melissa 
virus, which infected hundreds of thousands of machines. However, 
there were signs today that it may not be spreading as fast as 
Melissa. Computer security experts were still trying to assess the 
outbreak, which even infiltrated computer systems at technology 
leaders such as Compaq Computer and Motorola, as well as major 
companies including AT&AMP;T, Boeing and General Electric.

	Wholesale Inflation Eases in May  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Gasoline prices at the wholesale level fell  
2.7 percent in May, after rising a record 29.1 percent the month 
before. The sharp decline helped slow the overall wholesale price 
rise for May to 0.2 percent, down from 0.5 percent in April. Many 
analysts believe the moderation in wholesale prices will be 
reflected next Wednesday, when the consumer price report comes out. 

</P>
<P>
	Retail Sales Jump in May  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Retail sales jumped by 1 percent in May as  
U.S. consumers got ready for summer with purchases from shorts to 
patio furniture. The sales -- which represent about a third of the 
nation's economic output -- rose last month to a seasonally adjusted 
$242.2 billion, the Commerce Department said today. The May 
increase followed an April rise that, at a revised 0.4 percent, was 
better than initially estimated, the government said.

	U.S. Panel OKs Tariff on Japan Steel  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- U.S. steel producers won a crucial ruling when  
the U.S. International Trade Commission approved punitive tariffs 
to combat low-priced Japanese shipments. Tariffs ranging from 18 
percent to 67 percent will be ordered by the Clinton administration 
within weeks. Those tariffs will effectively make Japanese steel 
more expensive to sell in the United States. The trade commission

	Delta Defers Delivery Boeing 777s  
</P>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Delta Air Lines is deferring its remaining orders  
for new Boeing 777 planes because of a standoff in negotiations 
with its pilots' union. Delta began flying two of the wide-body 
jets May 1, but has already canceled four orders because of a lack 
of agreement with pilots who are seeking up to $319 an hour to fly 
the planes, based on their revenue-generating potential. A total 11 
orders have now been halted, Delta announced today. The carrier 
said it won't be able to schedule 777 flights after Nov. 1 because 
union rules allow the pilots to refuse to fly a new plane after six 
months without an agreement.

	Delta Air Lines Offers Web Discount  
</P>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Delta Air Lines is offering a 10 percent discount  
on flights to five southeastern U.S. states that are booked through 
the company's Web site. The discount, announced today, is subject 
to a three-day advance purchase requirement. It applies on 
economy-class flights to Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Mississippi and 
South Carolina. The online promotion lasts through Wednesday. Delta 
stock was down 1/4 at 57.

	Aerospace Firms Seek Air Show Boost  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Fallout from the conflict in Yugoslavia and a  
drop in demand for commercial airliners have cast a shadow over the 
prospects of aerospace companies participating in the world's 
biggest air show, which opens tomorrow near Paris. Business for 
suppliers of fighter jets could suffer because Western governments 
face steep bills for their military involvement in the Balkans. But 
companies are competing for expected replacement orders for bombs 
and missiles used in the conflict as well as spare parts for the 
fighter planes. The show, held every other year, will be an 
occasion for some companies to announce new contracts. Lockheed 
Martin Corp. of Bethesda, Md., even jumped the gun, announcing it 
has awarded contracts worth $200 million to British suppliers of 
parts used in its C-130J Hercules heavy transport.

	Hechinger Co. Files for Protection  
</P>
<P>
	LARGO, Md. (AP) -- Hechinger Co., the home improvement retailer  
that has been struggling against rivals such as Home Depot, filed 
today for protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of the federal 
bankruptcy law. The company will close 89 stores in 36 markets to 
reduce operating losses and focus on a core of healthier stores. 
The closures will leave about 117 stores operating in 21 states. 
Hechinger said it will focus on larger stores and its Home Quarters 
outlets. The company failed to make a $4.7 million interest payment 
on its unsecured debt May 15 and recently reported a loss of $228 
million for its quarter ended in April 3.

	DETROIT (AP) -- Ford Motor Co. named the architect of Jaguar Cars  
Ltd.'s revival to head its struggling European automotive 
operations, the latest move aimed at improving the No. 2 
automaker's lackluster performance in what was once one of its 
biggest profit centers. Nick Scheele, most recently vice president 
for marketing, sales and service at Ford of Europe, replaces James 
D. Donaldson as president of the unit. Donaldson in turn was named 
group vice president in charge of global business development. The 
changes are effective July 1. Ford has been fighting the steady 
erosion of its market share in Europe for a few years.

<HEADLINE> World Skate Champ Under Doc's Care </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Two-time world champion Alexei Yagudin is under a doctor's care  
in Russia for a drinking problem after being dismissed from a 
skating tour. 
</P>
<P>
	Yagudin, 19, was booted off the John Hancock Champions on Ice  
tour after a performance in Denver on May 27. He returned to his 
native Russia, where doctors have determined he is not an 
alcoholic. But he remains under their care. 
</P>
<P>
	``The doctors wanted to observe Alexei to see if it was a  
problem with alcoholism or just a case of a young man partying too 
much,'' Elizabeth DeSevo, Yagudin's publicist, said Friday. ``They 
determined he does not have a problem with alcoholism, but he needs 
to tone it down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Yagudin had been training in Freehold, N.J., with coach Tatiana  
Tarasova. But Tarasova recently returned to Russia for treatment of 
heart condition. DeSevo said Yagudin will remain in Russia while 
Tarasova is hospitalized. 
</P>
<P>
	Before joining the Champions on Ice tour in the spring, Yagudin  
successfully defended his world title. He said at the time he was 
``looking forward to being on tour with all of these great 
skaters.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But tour promoter Tom Collins dismissed him after Yagudin made  
some off-color remarks to a security guard at a show in New York, 
then offended another media member at the show in Denver. 
</P>
<P>
	Collins told Yagudin's agent, Michael Carlisle, that the skater  
would be welcomed back to the tour if his behavior improves. 
Collins is particularly sensitive about underage drinking on the 
tour. Oksana Baiul, the 1994 Olympic champion who has had several 
bouts with alcohol abuse, is a regular on the tour.

	Russian Troops Enter Kosovo  
</P>
<P>
	PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- An armored Russian column rolled  
into the Kosovo capital of Pristina to the cheers of crowds early 
Saturday, as NATO massed its own peacekeeping troops along the 
border apparently set to enter at dawn. There was shouting and 
fireworks as thousands of people crowded the main street of the 
city to greet the Russian soldiers, who arrived aboard trucks and 
troop transports. The long-term intentions of the Russian column 
weren't clear. The terms of Russian involvement in the peacekeeping 
effort haven't been settled. NATO said a ``substantial'' force of 
its own would be in Kosovo by Saturday afternoon.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- NATO peacekeeping troops should arrive in  
Kosovo soon, President Clinton said today, in order ``not to let 
some big vacuum develop.'' He expressed no concern about surprise 
Russian troop movements in the region. ``They were just 
prepositioning,'' Clinton said. ``The Russians, I think, would like 
to play a major role, but they understand General Jackson is in 
charge.'' Clinton spoke on PBS' ``NewsHour With Jim Lehrer'' in an 
interview from the Oval Office before Russian troops arrived in the 
Kosovo capital of Pristina.

normal life.'' To cheers, Albright declared Yugoslav President 
Slobodan Milosevic and the Serbs have given up control of Kosovo. 
``All the world knows about your suffering,'' she assured them. As 
Albright toured the Stenkovic camp, NATO troops made preparations 
to move into Kosovo to protect the returning ethnic Albanians. The 
deployments could begin Saturday.

	MOSCOW (AP) -- Russia's security chief said Friday he would  
resume contacts with his U.S. counterpart that were suspended when 
NATO launched airstrikes against Yugoslavia, a news agency

<HEADLINE>  Sabres Want To Give Buffalo a Title </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) -- Jim Kelly knows all about the sting of  
defeat in championship games, and he's heard all the jokes about 
Buffalo and the Bills. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, he hopes, the Buffalo Sabres will put that to rest for  
good. 
</P>
<P>
	``People are always ragging on the Bills and the people of  
Buffalo about those Super Bowls,'' the ex-Bills quarterback said. 
``Maybe this will shut some people up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Not since the Bills earned their fourth consecutive Super Bowl  
trip in 1994 have fans in these parts been so pumped, anticipating 
that ever elusive title. 
</P>
<P>
	A Stanley Cup win wouldn't erase the pain of the Super Bowl  
losses, but it could boost the psyche of a city dealt blow after 
blow for its perceived sports failures, harsh winters and economic 
hardships. 
</P>
<P>
	The possibility of a title started as the Memorial Day weekend  
was winding down. The roars of celebration pierced the night air, 
and few had to wonder what the fuss was about. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sabres had just scored on Dixon Ward's shot to the Toronto  
Maple Leafs' empty net. The Sabres were on their way to the Stanley 
Cup finals for the first time in 24 years. 
</P>
<P>
	``You could hear people screaming in the streets because they  
were so excited, and kids were yelling, and it was 10 o'clock at 
night,'' recalled Dave Pietrowski, who, like so many fans in 
western New York, had been riveted to the game on TV. 
</P>
<P>
	A week after Buffalo clinched the Stanley Cup berth, Dallas  
emerged as the Sabres' opponent. Dallas. The city that had broken 
Buffalo's heart not once, but twice, with consecutive Super Bowl 
victories after the 1993 and 1994 seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	Worse yet, the Dallas Stars, who were the NHL's best  
regular-season team, went into the finals heavily favored. The 
Sabres finished the regular season just seventh in their conference 
and have been underdogs throughout the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	Stars center Mike Modano openly wondered if the Stanley Cup  
finals, already awarded to Dallas in the minds of many, might prove 
a letdown. 
</P>
<P>
	Fan Bob Young was among the many who thought the Colorado  
Avalanche, the Stars' Western Conference rival, would have been the 
more desirable opponent. Simply put, if a Buffalo team falls again 
to a Dallas team, Young said, ``I don't want to hear about it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After the Avalanche's Game 7 loss to Dallas, Woody Paige wrote  
in the Denver Post: ``It could be worse. We could live in Buffalo 
for obvious reasons and because (Buffalo) has never won a Super 
Bowl, an NBA championship, a World Series or a Stanley Cup (and 
likely won't again this season). Buffalo falls more than Niagara.'' 
</P>
<P>
	All that bashing takes a toll on a community's self-esteem.  
</P>
<P>
	``A Stanley Cup championship would give Buffalo a positive  
image; then, by inference, people would begin to think that there 
is something special about the city,'' said Arun Jain, a marketing 
professor at the University at Buffalo. ``After they take a longer 
look at Buffalo, they'll learn that the city has a lot to offer 
beyond professional sports.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Plus, it would just make the city's long-suffering fans feel  
better. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am the consummate loser,'' declared Pietrowski, a Sabres and  
Bills season-ticket holder. ``I went to Syracuse University. I've 
been to two Final Fours, a Sugar Bowl, four Super Bowls, and my 
team has never won.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The memories are hardly bad, though, he said, recalling the  
parties and camaraderie. And, win or lose the Stanley Cup, Buffalo 
fans aren't likely to start hurling themselves from the Peace 
Bridge over another missed chance. 
</P>
<P>
	``When the Bills are 8-8 or 16-0, it's virtually the same  
audience,'' Pietrowski said, pointing to the team's regular 
sellouts. ``It's the same thing with the Sabres. It wasn't too long 
ago we were drafting first in the draft and we finished last, but 
there were still 12,000 people at every game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rick Martin, a member of the last Sabres team to compete for the  
Stanley Cup, still lives in the area. He's not convinced a 
championship would do much for the city's image. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a great town but the media likes to beat up on Buffalo.  
Even if they win it somebody will come up with some kind of 
negative spin,'' he said. ``They'll find a way to downplay 
Buffalo.''

<HEADLINE> US: Documents Release Unfortunate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The State Department expressed regret Friday  
that 16 German companies decided to make public their plan to 
compensate hundreds of thousands of Jews who engaged in forced 
labor for the firms during the Nazi era. 
</P>
<P>
	Calling the release unfortunate, spokesman James Foley said,  
``This is not something that we think was a positive development.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said the document was not conclusive but rather a proposal by  
a group of German companies. Victim groups reacted negatively to 
the proposal, which calls for lump-sum payments. 
</P>
<P>
	The release was not an attempt to undermine the process, Foley  
said, adding that the document would have been presented at a June 
17 meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	Negotiations on the issue have been going on for months. They  
involve the governments of Germany, the United States, Israel and 
some East European countries; German companies and Jewish 
representatives.

<HEADLINE> Report: Lakers Offer Jackson Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Phil Jackson, who coached the Chicago Bulls  
to six NBA championships in the 1990s, has reportedly been offered 
a four-year deal worth more than $20 million to coach the Los 
Angeles Lakers. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson's agent, Todd Musburger, is in ``serious negotiations''  
with the Lakers, Fox Sports News reported Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
	The network said a source familiar with the negotiations said  
the deal could be finalized within the next few days. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can't confirm it, we can't deny it,'' Lakers owner Jerry  
Buss said of the report following the Los Angeles Sparks' WNBA 
opener Thursday night at the Forum. ``I've been out of town. I've 
got to talk to Jerry West. We'll see.'' 
</P>
<P>
	West, the team's executive vice president of basketball  
operations, told the Los Angeles Times the Lakers have explored the 
possibility of offering the coaching job to Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
	However, West said no offer has been made to Jackson, and ``it  
would be wrong to presume a deal was near.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We've talked about a lot of different parameters to a couple  
different people,'' said West, who added the team has had similar 
discussions with Kurt Rambis, who finished the season as interim 
coach. ``There's going to be a lot of speculation out there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	West also said Jackson ``would make a very attractive candidate,  
yes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	West said he has not spoken to Jackson, but did not comment when  
asked if he had been speaking with Musberger, who told the Times he 
would have no comment on the matter for now. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson was on vacation in Alaska and unavailable for comment.  
</P>
<P>
	Jackson left the Bulls after they won their sixth championship  
last June, and didn't coach this season. Several other teams, 
including the New York Knicks and New Jersey Nets, also are 
reportedly interested in hiring Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lakers, swept by San Antonio in the second round of the  
playoffs, hired Rambis as interim coach after Del Harris was fired 
early in the lockout-shortened 1999 season.

<HEADLINE> Abu-Jamal Asked To Tape Speech </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OLYMPIA, Wash. (AP) -- A decision by Evergreen State College  
students to invite a Pennsylvania death row convict to send a taped 
speech for today's commencement has angered many -- from the slain 
policeman's widow to a powerful congressman. 
</P>
<P>
	Mumia Abu-Jamal is awaiting execution for the 1981 slaying of a  
Philadelphia police officer. The prison journalist and former Black 
Panther claims he was railroaded and has become a symbol for 
anti-death penalty groups. 
</P>
<P>
	House Majority Whip Tom DeLay, R-Texas, asked for a moment of  
silence on the House floor Thursday to protest the invitation, his 
spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
	``America wonders why there are shootings in schools,'' DeLay  
said at a news conference this morning. ``Well, irresponsible 
institutions making celebrities out of killers are part of our 
problem.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no justifiable reason for an institution of higher  
learning to have a convicted murderer speak to its students,'' 
DeLay said earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	DeLay said his ``heart goes out'' to Maureen Faulkner, widow of  
Officer Daniel Faulkner. Ms. Faulkner has said she plans to attend 
the commencement with a picture of her husband. 
</P>
<P>
	Evergreen President Jane Jervis said students chose Abu-Jamal to  
address the 800 graduates due to his efforts ``to galvanize an 
international conversation about the death penalty, the 
disproportionate number of blacks on death row and the relationship 
between poverty and the criminal justice system.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gov. Gary Locke canceled plans to attend ceremonies at the  
state-supported school in deference to police. A group of local 
off-duty officers planned to protest the event. 
</P>
<P>
	Pennsylvania Attorney General Mike Fisher wrote to Jervis on  
Thursday, asking her to cancel the speech. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is an affront to the memory of Officer Faulkner, his family  
and all victims of violent crime for your institution to glorify 
this cop killer,'' he wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	Evergreen's student body has an activist legacy. Hundreds  
occupied a chamber at the state Capitol at the start of the Gulf 
War. Last year, students supporting Abu-Jamal attempted to shout 
down Vice President Al Gore as he spoke at a city park. 
</P>
<P>
	Abu-Jamal has appealed his case to the U.S. Supreme Court.

<HEADLINE> Washington St. Players Plead Guilty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLFAX, Wash. (AP) -- Kevin Brown, a 1,000-yard rusher last  
season, and two other Washington State football players were 
sentenced to 30 days in jail after pleading guilty to felony 
residential burglary on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown, who ran for 1,046 yards as a sophomore last season; Ramin  
White, a freshman defensive back; and Jason White, a redshirt 
freshman wide receiver pleaded guilty in a plea agreement to 
stealing $1,900 worth of electronic gear from another student's 
apartment on May 16. The Whites are not related. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the plea bargain, prosecutors dropped a lesser count of  
felony theft. 
</P>
<P>
	Washington State coach Mike Price suspended the players after  
their arrest and has said that he'd kick them off the team if they 
pleaded guilty or were found guilty. Price was out of town Friday 
and unavailable for comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Each player was sentenced to 30 days in the Whitman County Jail,  
two years probation and 240 hours of community service. Each must 
pay $450 in restitution. 
</P>
<P>
	``This wasn't really much of a plea bargain,'' Whitman County  
prosecutor Jim Kaufman said. ``We felt this was a serious incident 
and we had a good case.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors had recommended 90 days in jail.

<HEADLINE> DVD Cos. Allowed To License Patents </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Looking to technology that appears destined to  
replace VCRs and compact discs, the Justice Department gave the 
go-ahead Thursday for six manufacturers jointly to license patents 
so other companies can produce digital video discs and players. 
</P>
<P>
	Under an arrangement approved by the Justice Department's  
antitrust division, companies that make DVD-Video and DVD-ROM discs 
and players can use the technology owned by the six manufacturers. 
</P>
<P>
	Pooling the patents held by the six businesses will reduce costs  
for obtaining the technology, while raising little possibility of 
competitive harm, said Joel I. Klein, assistant attorney general in 
charge of the department's antitrust division, in a letter. 
</P>
<P>
	A DVD -- which is the same size as a CD but with seven times the  
capacity -- can hold a two-hour feature film. Nintendo's 
next-generation video game player will have DVD technology, as will 
Sony Corp.'s next-generation Playstation video game system. 
</P>
<P>
	Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. Ltd. -- one of the six  
companies -- will make DVD drives for Nintendo. Matsushita is the 
world's largest maker of consumer electronics with brands such as 
Panasonic and Quasar. 
</P>
<P>
	Toshiba Corp. will offer licenses on behalf of Hitachi Ltd.,  
Matsushita, Time Warner Inc., and Victor Co. of Japan Ltd. 
</P>
<P>
	The six companies plus four others established specifications  
for players to read the discs and convert them into images for 
screen display. 
</P>
<P>
	It is the second request for the Justice Department to approve a  
DVD-Video and DVD-ROM patent pool. 
</P>
<P>
	Last December, the department approved the pool formed by  
Koninklijke Philips Electronics N.V., Sony Corp. of Japan and 
Pioneer Electronic Corp. of Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	Sony is moving to DVDs for its next-generation of video games.  
</P>
<P>
	Under Justice Department procedures, organizations submit  
proposals to the antitrust division headed by Klein and receive a 
statement on whether the government will challenge the action.

<HEADLINE> Manufacturer Recalls Drink Mixes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- About 12,500 cases of diet drink mixes, iced-tea  
mixes and sugar replacements are being recalled in Michigan, eight 
other states and Hungary because the products may contain pieces of 
aluminum metal, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration said. 
</P>
<P>
	Manufacturer Ontario Foods Inc. of Albion, N.Y., notified the  
FDA early last month and began recalling the product from store 
shelves in Michigan, Florida, Illinois, Massachusetts, Maryland, 
Nebraska, New Jersey, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Hungary. 
</P>
<P>
	The recall is posted on the FDA's Web site.  
</P>
<P>
	Last week, the FDA determined the metal could cause at least a  
``temporary health problem'' to consumers. Because of this, it 
asked the manufacturer to conduct a Class 2 recall, which requires 
the product be removed from store shelves without requiring public 
notification. 
</P>
<P>
	``This does not present a serious health risk,'' Mark Leunig,  
vice president of Genesee Corp., owner of Ontario Foods, told the 
Detroit Free Press.

	QUITO, Ecuador (AP) -- Some 250 species of mammals, birds and  
reptiles are in danger of extinction in the mountains and jungles 
of Ecuador, ecologists said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the species facing extinction are condors, jaguars,  
otters, lizards, snakes and parrots, said Deborah Chiriboga, a 
biologist with the Nature Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
	The wildlife is threatened by the incursion of humans into their  
jungle habitat, she said. More than 120 mammal species and 150 bird 
species have become extinct in Ecuador since the 17th century.

	MEXICO CITY (AP) -- More than 1,200 Mexicans have been driven  
from their homes by recent hailstorms and flooding, according to 
reports Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Hail pelted neighborhoods in the Michoacan state capital of  
Morelia on Wednesday, blasting holes in laminated roofing and 
forcing some people to hide under tables for protection, the 
newspaper Reforma reported Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Police in that western city said some 1,000 people were forced  
from their houses. Another 200 people in the north-central state of 
Zacatecas were also forced to evacuate due to flooding late 
Wednesday, the newspaper reported.

	MEXICO CITY (AP) -- After spending 20 months in jail, four  
policemen have been cleared of charges that they participated in 
the death of six young men in 1997, newspapers reported Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Judge Cleofas Lucas Perez on Thursday found the four men  
innocent after their attorneys established that they were not at 
the scene of the crime. 
</P>
<P>
	The six youths were taken into custody after a Sept. 8 shootout  
in a slum in central Mexico City. Their bodies were found days 
later with signs of torture and gunshot wounds.

lone male guard on Friday and escaped from an overcrowded precinct 
jail, police said.

	Precinct chief Estela Cristina Bonjardim said 23 of the jail's  
50 prisoners escaped shortly after midnight from the two-cell 
facility in Sao Bernardo do Campo, an industrial suburb on the 
outskirts of Sao Paulo. The jail was built to hold no more than 16. 
</P>
<P>
	``One prisoner feigned illness and when the guard went to check,  
the women overpowered him, took his gun away and handcuffed him 
inside the cell,'' Bonjardim said. 
</P>

	None of the escapees, mostly drug dealers and petty thieves,  
have been recaptured, Bonjardim said.

	Interior Minister Carlos Corach said Friday the federal

<HEADLINE> Congress KO's Kosovo Fund Cutoff </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton is promising Congress he'll  
soon be seeking funds to pay for U.S. participation in peacekeeping 
operations in Kosovo apart from the regular defense budget. 
</P>
<P>
	The operation will be performed ``without harming military  
readiness,'' Clinton said in a letter to all House members. 
</P>
<P>
	The late afternoon letter on Thursday helped diffuse a tense  
battle in Congress over a GOP effort to bar funds for any 
operations in Yugoslavia -- even peacekeeping in the province of 
Kosovo -- after Sept. 30. 
</P>
<P>
	``Congress would be the laughingstock of the world,'' if such  
legislation passed one day after the dramatic Kosovo peace 
agreement, said Rep. Ike Skelton of Missouri, the senior Democrat 
on the House Armed Services Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	In the end, the House voted 270-155 to remove the cutoff  
provision from a $288.8 billion defense spending bill. Voting in 
favor of keeping the ban were 142 Republicans and 13 Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
	The overall bill was then approved 365-58.  
</P>
<P>
	It contains a 4.8 percent military pay raise and measures to  
tighten security at the nation's nuclear weapons labs. It now must 
be reconciled with a similar bill that earlier passed the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	While both bills are alike, there are important differences.  
</P>
<P>
	The House bill, for instance, would order U.S. troops home from  
Haiti at the end of this year. It also would authorize the military 
to be used in the war against drugs in border areas. Neither 
provision is in the Senate measure. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's letter promised to seek congressional funds ``in a  
timely manner'' for U.S. participation in an international 
peacekeeping force expected to include 7,000 Americans. He signed 
the letter ``Bill.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Defense Secretary William Cohen said the peacekeeping operation  
was likely to cost U.S. taxpayers $1.5 billion to $2 billion a 
year. Independent estimates put the range at about twice that. An 
estimate by the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessment 
estimated the price tag at $2 billion to $3.5 billion a year. 
</P>
<P>
	Republican skeptics said they wanted Clinton to put in writing  
his verbal promise to congressional leaders not to further deplete 
an already thinly stretched military budget with the Kosovo peace 
operation. He did. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans also wanted assurances that no U.S. funds would be  
used to rebuild Serbia as long as Slobodan Milosevic remained in 
power. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton pledged in his Thursday night Oval Office address to the  
nation that Serbs should know the United States would not help them 
rebuild ``as long as your nation is ruled by an indicted war 
criminal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Floyd Spence, R-S.C., chairman of the House Armed Services  
Committee, and an original supporter of the restrictions on Kosovo 
funds, said the Clinton letter had eased his concerns -- and enabled 
him to vote to do away with the restrictive provision. 
</P>
<P>
	The letter ``changed the landscape,'' said John Feehery, a  
spokesman for House Speaker Dennis Hastert. Hastert also voted 
against the fund cutoff. 
</P>
<P>
	But Democratic leaders suggested the Clinton letter only gave  
Republicans political cover, protecting them from what would have 
been a major embarrassment. They said it only put in writing what 
Clinton had been saying and was almost identical to one sent to 
Congress the day before by Budget Director Jacob Lew. 
</P>
<P>
	``Congress has been criticized for its erratic Kosovo policy.  
This is our chance to be consistent,'' House Minority Leader Dick 
Gephardt, D-Mo., said in a House speech. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've won the war. ... We now have an opportunity to win the  
peace,'' Gephardt said. 
</P>
<P>
	In late April, the House refused to endorse, on a 213-213 tie  
vote, the NATO airstrikes then under way.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Bancorp Boots Telemarketers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- U.S. Bancorp broke off its relationships with  
about 15 telemarketing firms, one day after the state filed a 
lawsuit alleging one of those deals broke the law. 
</P>
<P>
	Thursday's decision ends the bank's arrangements with marketers  
that sell nonfinancial services and appeared to be an attempt to 
quickly head off any customer revolt. 
</P>
<P>
	In a suit filed Wednesday, Minnesota Attorney General Mike Hatch  
accused U.S. Bancorp, the largest bank based in Minnesota, of 
illegally selling customer data to a telemarketing firm and 
pocketing $4 million in commissions and fees. 
</P>
<P>
	The bank denied it misused customer information and said the  
bank will vigorously defend itself against Hatch's allegations. 
</P>
<P>
	In full-page ads in today's Star Tribune and Saint Paul Pioneer  
Press, U.S. Bancorp Chief Executive John Grundhofer moved to 
counter the bad publicity with an open letter to the customers and 
communities the bank serves. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is nothing we value more than the trust you put in us.  
When that trust is called into question it's something we take very 
seriously,'' the letter said. 
</P>
<P>
	``As a result we're ending our participation in this and all  
similar types of marketing programs for nonfinancial products. By 
doing this, we retain our focus on providing banking, investment 
and insurance solutions,'' it said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bank spokesman Don Waage said executives decided that it was too  
confusing for customers to have the bank affiliated with sales of 
nonfinancial products. 
</P>
<P>
	Hatch accused the bank of fraud and false advertising and said  
it violated the federal Fair Credit Reporting Act because it shared 
bank information and data from credit bureaus with a third party 
while promising customers in writing that their account information 
would be kept confidential. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal law doesn't prohibit a bank from selling data, but  
prohibits the sharing of information obtained from a third party, 
such as credit bureaus.

<HEADLINE> IRS Allows Smokers Some Deductions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Calling nicotine a ``powerfully addictive  
drug,'' the Internal Revenue Service reversed a 20-year-old 
position and will permit smokers to claim medical expense 
deductions for some costs of trying to quit. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's about time,'' said Dr. Mike Eriksen, director of smoking  
and health at the federal Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta. 
``There is no better preventative program than stopping someone 
from smoking.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors involved in smoking cessation programs said the IRS  
ruling Thursday could have broader ramifications by persuading 
providers of health benefits packages to include such treatment in 
their coverage. 
</P>
<P>
	Citing surgeon general reports since 1988 that nicotine is  
addictive and smoking harms health, the IRS concluded that programs 
and prescription drugs that help someone quit smoking are no 
different from efforts to treat alcoholism or drug addiction -- both 
of which are already tax deductible. 
</P>
<P>
	``What the research of the last decade has documented is that  
this is one of the most powerful addictions that a person can 
succumb to,'' said Dr. Michael Fiore, director of the Center for 
Tobacco Research and Prevention at the University of Wisconsin. 
``It's not just some bad habit. It's a dangerous, chronic 
disease.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In reversing a 1979 decision and allowing the deduction, the IRS  
agreed: ``A strong causal link exists between smoking and several 
diseases,'' the agency said in its announcement. ``Nicotine, a 
substance common to all forms of tobacco, is a powerfully addictive 
drug.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Not every expense can be deducted. The law does not permit a  
taxpayer to claim such nonprescription medications as nicotine 
patches or gum that are commonly sold over the counter and compose 
the most frequent treatments. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, the total in medical expenses -- smoking-related or  
otherwise -- must reach 7.5 percent of a taxpayer's adjusted gross 
income in order to qualify as an itemized deduction. 
</P>
<P>
	But prescriptions, doctor bills or cessation programs offered by  
hospitals or other treatment facilities could be deducted, so long 
as they are not reimbursed by an employer or by insurance. Some 
over-the-counter drugs also can be obtained with a prescription. 
</P>
<P>
	Eriksen said there are an increasing number of intensive  
programs available, including some at drug treatment centers that 
have added nicotine addiction. There are also more and more 
pharmaceutical options, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's the right thing to do in terms of the dollar invested and  
the dollar saved,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Taxpayers who paid for a smoking cessation program in recent  
years could file an amended return to claim those costs, 
particularly if they already had enough medical expenses to 
qualify. Other taxpayers should check past returns to figure if the 
smoking expenses reached the 7.5 percent of adjusted gross income 
threshold. 
</P>
<P>
	Taxpayers can generally file an amended return for three years  
after the due date of the original return using IRS Form 1040X.

	Russian Troops Go Into Kosovo  
</P>
<P>
	PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- A convoy of Russian soldiers rolled  
into the Kosovo capital of Pristina early Saturday to the crackle 
of gunfire, honking horns and cheering Serb crowds, the force 
apparently defying what NATO said was an understanding that Russia 
not enter the province alone. Shortly after their entry -- just 
hours before NATO was to send its own peacekeepers into Kosovo -- 
Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov said the troops had arrived 
``unfortunately.'' On CNN, Ivanov said: ``They have been ordered to 
leave Kosovo immediately and to await further orders.'' The Russian 
news agency ITAR-Tass said the decision for Russian troops to 
advance had been made by the Defense Ministry and the Yugoslav 
military.

	U.S. Surprised by Russian Move  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The United States was surprised by the  
movement of Russian troops into the Kosovo capital of Pristina just 
hours after getting assurances that NATO peacekeeping forces would 
arrive first. ``As (Russian) Foreign Minister (Igor) Ivanov has 
said, it was an unfortunate mistake and the Russian troops will be 
withdrawn immediately,'' White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said. 
``We're pleased that they've agreed to rectify the situation. The 
constructive talks toward determining the Russian's role in the 
peacekeeping forces continue with (U.S. Deputy Secretary of State) 
Strobe Talbott in Moscow.''

	Albright Vistis Refugee Camp  
</P>
<P>
	SKOPJE, Macedonia (AP) -- Secretary of State Madeleine Albright  
assured ethnic Albanian refugees that NATO peacekeepers would help 
them return home ``to live a decent, normal life.'' To cheers, 
Albright declared Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic and the 
Serbs have given up control of Kosovo. ``All the world knows about 
your suffering,'' she assured them. As Albright toured the 
Stenkovic camp, NATO troops made preparations to move into Kosovo 
to protect the returning ethnic Albanians. The deployments could 
begin Saturday.

	SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- The online auction house eBay fixed its  
site tonight after a computer crash forced it to suspend bidding, 
frustrating millions of customers of one of the hottest Internet 
businesses. The halt came after eBay tried to launch a revamped

<HEADLINE> Belle, O's Mgr. in Shouting Match </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- The Baltimore Orioles aren't saying what, if any,  
disciplinary measures will be taken against slugger Albert Belle 
following his shouting match with manager Ray Miller. 
</P>
<P>
	``When things like that happen on the bench or in the clubhouse,  
those are the type things we deal with internally,'' general 
manager Frank Wrenn said Thursday after the Orioles arrived in 
Atlanta for a series with the Braves starting tonight at Turner 
Field. 
</P>
<P>
	``What was said and what was done is an internal matter,'' Wrenn  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	He also said Miller ``isn't going to say any more about it,  
either.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Belle, who signed a five-year, $65 million free agent contract  
with Baltimore in December, has been suspended six times during his 
career. His disdain of the media is well known. 
</P>
<P>
	Belle, who has been struggling at the plate this year, had to be  
restrained by teammates after being removed from Wednesday night's 
4-2 victory over the Marlins. 
</P>
<P>
	Miller could not be reached for comment Thursday. A call to his  
Atlanta hotel room was answered by an unidentified person, who hung 
up when the reporter identified himself. 
</P>
<P>
	The incident occurred in the top of the ninth inning in the  
Orioles' dugout after Belle, who went 0-for-5 in the game, failed 
to run out a ground ball. 
</P>
<P>
	With two runners on and two outs in the ninth and the Orioles  
leading 4-2, Belle grounded to Marlins third baseman Mike Lowell. 
Belle slowed halfway to first, but Lowell's throw pulled first 
baseman Kevin Millar off the bag. 
</P>
<P>
	Miller replaced Belle in the outfield with Rich Amaral, a move  
he said he planned to make before Belle's groundout. 
</P>
<P>
	``Amaral knew he was going in if Albert made the last out when  
the inning started,'' Miller said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Belle was unaware of the move until he was on his way to his  
outfield position, eventually jogging back to the dugout. 
</P>
<P>
	In the dugout, TV cameras caught an exchange of expletives  
between Miller and Belle. Belle yelled angrily at Miller and was 
restrained by teammate Jeff Reboulet. Miller waved Belle off with a 
toss of his hand. 
</P>
<P>
	``My comment is that what happens internally will stay internal  
and will be taken care of internally,'' Miller said. ``What goes on 
between me and anybody stays in the clubhouse.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Belle, approached by reporters after the game, brushed them off  
with a stream of expletives. 
</P>
<P>
	Belle, struggling with a .244 batting average, has hit only one  
home run in his last 21 games. The Orioles, with a $78.5 million 
payroll, are the most disappointing team in baseball with a 22-36 
record, and there has been speculation that Miller's job is in 
jeopardy.

<HEADLINE> Wholesale Inflation Eases in May </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Inflation at the wholesale level slowed  
significantly in May as gasoline prices retreated after a record 
price jump, the government said today. 
</P>
<P>
	The Producer Price Index, which measures inflation pressures  
before they reach the consumer, rose just 0.2 percent last month, 
down sharply from the 0.5 percent advance in April. 
</P>
<P>
	The moderation reflected a big drop in energy prices. Gasoline  
prices at the wholesale level, which had risen by a record 29.1 
percent in April, retreated somewhat in May, declining 2.7 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Big increases in both wholesale and consumer prices last month  
set off inflation jitters in financial markets. 
</P>
<P>
	After consumer prices jumped 0.9 percent in April, a nine-year  
high, the Federal Reserve let it be known that it was now leaning 
toward raising interest rates to keep inflation from getting out of 
control. 
</P>
<P>
	Many analysts believe that the moderation shown today in  
wholesale prices will also be reflected when the government reports 
next Wednesday on consumer prices. But analysts cautioned if 
consumer prices don't ease, the Fed is almost certain to start 
raising interest rates at their next meeting on June 29-30. 
</P>
<P>
	In a separate report, the Commerce Department said today that  
retail sales jumped by a strong 1 percent in May as Americans got 
ready for summer with purchases of everything from shorts to patio 
furniture. 
</P>
<P>
	So far this year, inflation at the wholesale level is rising at  
an annual rate of 2 pervent after having been flat in 1998. The 
acceleration in price pressures this year reflects a rebound in 
energy. American motorists got a big price break last year as the 
Asian currency crisis created a glut of crude oil on world markets, 
driving down prices. 
</P>
<P>
	For May, the 2.7 percent drop in gasoline prices, the biggest  
decline since last December, offset increases in home heating oil 
and natural gas, leaving overall energy costs unchanged for the 
month following a 5.1 percent surge in April. 
</P>
<P>
	Motorists are already starting to see the price declines at the  
wholesale level at the pump. Surveys show that gasoline pump 
prices, after having risen for more than two months, have started 
to edge down slightly. 
</P>
<P>
	Food prices last month rose 0.5 percent after a big 0.9 percent  
drop in April. The May increase included a big jump in pork prices. 
Fruit prices were also up sharply, with big gains for grapefruit, 
lemons and pears. 
</P>
<P>
	However, vegetable prices fell last month as the price of  
cauliflower, squash and lettuce all posted big declines. 
</P>
<P>
	Excluding the volatile food and energy sectors, prices at the  
wholesale level rose a tiny 0.1 percent, matching the small 
increase in April. So far this year, the so-called core rate of 
inflation at the wholesale level has been flat, an even better 
performance than a 1.9 percent rate of increase in the first five 
months of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	For May, auto prices posted a 0.7 percent jump, the biggest gain  
since last September. Women's and men's clothing prices also rose 
in May.

<HEADLINE> Medical Devices Getting Y2K Checks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Food and Drug Administration is preparing  
a list of medical device makers with products that could have Y2K 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
	The FDA also may issue public warnings or suggest voluntary  
recalls if the agency finds medical devices that could malfunction 
on Jan. 1, 2000, the Health and Human Services deputy secretary, 
Kevin Thurm, said. 
</P>
<P>
	In extreme cases, he said, dangerous devices will be seized.  
</P>
<P>
	Thurm spoke Thursday at a hearing of the Senate's special panel  
on the year 2000 computer problem. The Senate, meantime, tried to 
finish work on a bill, eagerly sought by business and high-tech 
groups, that would limit the ability to sue over Y2K-related 
breakdowns. 
</P>
<P>
	The legislation would give companies a 90-day period to fix  
computer problems before lawsuits can be filed, encourage 
mediation, make it harder to file class action lawsuits and cap 
punitive damages that small businesses must pay. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration supports the idea of stopping  
frivolous lawsuits but has threatened a veto, saying the bill would 
hurt consumers and small businesses with legitimate legal claims. 
</P>
<P>
	The FDA action on medical devices came amid concerns that the  
health industry may be one of the most vulnerable to problems from 
computers that read only the last two digits in dates and mistake 
2000 for 1900.

<HEADLINE> Report Cites Resegregation Trend </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Forty-five years after the Supreme Court  
effectively ended legal segregation of public schools, most 
students still attend schools dominated by those of their own race 
and income level, a Harvard University report says. 
</P>
<P>
	A study of school enrollment patterns since 1968, when most  
school districts began court-ordered desegregation remedies, shows 
the trend toward resegregation of the races is growing despite 
rising numbers of minority enrollments. 
</P>
<P>
	Resegregation is proceeding fastest in the South, though the  
races are now most separate in schools in other regions. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are clearly in a period when many policy-makers, courts,  
and opinion makers assume that desegregation is no longer 
necessary,'' says an excerpt from ``Resegregation in American 
Schools,'' a report by the Civil Rights Project, a research and 
advocacy organization run by the Harvard Graduate School of 
Education and Harvard Law School. 
</P>
<P>
	The report also said:  
</P>
<P>
	--Enrollment of Hispanic students has increased 218 percent, and  
nearly 75 percent of them attend predominantly minority schools. 
</P>
<P>
	--Enrollment of black students has risen 22 percent, and 69  
percent of them attend schools where at least half the students are 
from minority groups. 
</P>
<P>
	--Enrollment of white students has declined by 16 percent in the  
same 30 years, and most of those students attend schools that are 
80 percent or more white. 
</P>
<P>
	That remains so even when white students live in generally  
nonwhite areas, said the report, which was based on a study of 
Education Department enrollment data from the late 1960s through 
the mid-1990s. At the same time, black and Hispanic students 
generally remain in black- and Hispanic-majority schools even when 
they live in the suburbs. 
</P>
<P>
	The study attributes much of the trend of minority- or  
white-dominated schools to economics and housing patterns. As for 
the trends in minority and white totals, it notes increases in 
Hispanic immigration and births and a decrease in white births. 
</P>
<P>
	Schools with mostly black and Hispanic students also were 11  
times more likely to be in areas with concentrated poverty than 
their peers in predominantly white schools. Researchers say that, 
too, can be damaging because poverty is linked to lower classroom 
performance and achievement. 
</P>
<P>
	In general, the researchers say, the schools with many poor  
children lack advanced courses and teachers with credentials for 
their subject areas. Such schools are more likely than others to 
have children who drop out, suffer from untreated health problems 
and forgo college. 
</P>
<P>
	Black students are most likely to go to majority black schools  
in the following states, in order: Michigan, Illinois, New York, 
New Jersey and Maryland. The top states for Hispanic student 
concentration are, in order: New York, Texas, New Jersey, 
California and Illinois. 
</P>
<P>
	White children are also less likely to attend schools with  
minorities in these states.

<HEADLINE> Ricky Martin Rocks Rockefeller Center </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- About 3,000 people jammed the blocks around  
NBC's ``Today'' studio Friday to catch a live outdoor performance 
by Ricky Martin, the Puerto Rican singing sensation. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was so good. Now I can brag to all my friends,'' said a  
delighted 12-year-old Jennifer Rasmussen of Toms River, N.J., who 
woke up at 4 a.m. and played hooky from school to see Martin. 
</P>
<P>
	As the throng squealed and threw streamers and confetti, Martin  
performed his signature hit, ``Livin' la Vida Loca'' -- which means 
living the crazy life -- and two other songs on an outdoor stage in 
Rockefeller Center. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's just so hot,'' said Rocia Rivera, a 26-year-old tourist  
from Puerto Rico. 
</P>
<P>
	A few dozen fans camped out Thursday night to get a good spot.  
</P>
<P>
	``He's really cute, and I heard that he's sweet,'' said Christy  
Monior, 17, who came with three friends. ``It's a bonding 
experience.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Suzanne Martinez, 49, and her daughter, Alysa Monachelli, 29,  
have followed Martin around the country since he was 12 and singing 
with the '80s pop group Menudo. Ms. Monachelli's 4-year-old 
daughter, Ashtyn, knows every word to ``La Vida Loca.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``She's been dancing to his music since she was 1,'' Ms.  
Monachelli said. 
</P>
<P>
	Martin, 27, is enjoying success with his first English-language  
CD, titled simply ``Ricky Martin.'' It had the best-ever album 
debut by a Hispanic artist on the mainstream Billboard charts.

<HEADLINE> Delta Bars Delivery of Boeing 777s </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Delta Air Lines has grounded its lofty plans for  
the new Boeing 777 planes because of an ongoing pay dispute with 
pilots. 
</P>
<P>
	The carrier announced Friday that it has halted future  
deliveries of the wide-body jets designed for long hauls and may 
sell or lease the two planes it began flying May 1. The airline 
said it can't include the planes in its upcoming winter schedule 
because of disagreement with pilots, who are seeking up to $319 an 
hour to fly the 777. 
</P>
<P>
	``I regret the action Delta has had to take regarding the 777  
program. The 777 was an integral part of our fleet plan and would 
have contributed substantially to achieving our goals,'' said Leo 
Mullin, Delta's chief executive officer. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokeswoman for the Air Line Pilots Association said the  
pilots are being used as ``a convenient scapegoat.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Since B-777 negotiations began in February, management has  
shown little interest in or commitment to reaching an agreement 
with the pilots,'' said Karen McGuffey, a spokeswoman for Delta 
pilots. 
</P>
<P>
	She said the company has barely moved from its opening offer  
``and has spent the majority of the negotiating period issuing 
ultimatums about the B-777 fleet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The union has suggested that Delta's position may be related to  
a softening of the trans-Atlantic market on which many of the 
planes would have been used. 
</P>
<P>
	A total 11 orders have now been halted, Delta said, adding that  
it won't be able to schedule 777 flights after Nov. 1 because of 
union rules that allow the pilots to refuse to fly a new plane 
after six months without an agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	Delta said its winter flight schedule must be ready by about  
Aug. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	``We still hope to reach an agreement with our pilots, but we  
cannot risk a disruption to our customers and we have to be 
economically feasible,'' Delta spokeswoman Kay Horner said. 
</P>
<P>
	Delta said it has offered pilots ``an industry-leading  
package,'' including up to $239 an hour for captains. 
</P>
<P>
	The two sides plan to meet again next week, but there have been  
no new proposals in their last two sessions. ``The parties remain 
far apart,'' Delta said. 
</P>
<P>
	Delta has been using the Boeing 777-200 planes, which carry 277  
people, on London-Cincinnati service and Atlanta-Orlando flights. 
Those two planes could be sold or leased if no pilots' agreement is 
reached, Ms. Horner said. 
</P>
<P>
	To replace the four 777 orders that were canceled earlier, Delta  
has ordered four Boeing 767-300ER aircraft. The smaller plane seats 
197 passengers.

<HEADLINE> 3 Guilty of Laundering Millions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Two Mexican bankers and a lawyer have been  
convicted of conspiring to launder millions of dollars for a 
Colombian drug cartel in what prosecutors say is the largest such 
probe in U.S. history. 
</P>
<P>
	Three others were acquitted Thursday in the first federal trial  
stemming from Operation Casablanca, a three-year sting in which 
agents and an undercover informer posed as money launderers for the 
Cali cartel. 
</P>
<P>
	Dozens of people were arrested in the case that strained  
U.S.-Mexico relations when Mexican officials learned that U.S. 
agents were working in Mexico without notifying them. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors say they broke a scheme in which bankers charged  
commissions to accept $70 million in cartel drug money while 
issuing bank drafts for the traffickers. 
</P>
<P>
	About 40 Mexican and Venezuelan businessmen were indicted. U.S.  
customs officials seized $100 million from 14 banks and dozens of 
individuals who were accused of laundering money for the Cali drug 
cartel in Colombia, and the Juarez cartel in Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
	Convicted of conspiracy and money laundering were Jose Reyes  
Ortega Gonzales, a former manager of banking operations for 
Bancomer in Tepatitlan, Mexico; Manuel Barraza Leon, a Bancomer 
branch manager in Tijuana; and Alfonso Labrada Gurrola, who worked 
at a Tijuana law firm that represented banks. 
</P>
<P>
	Acquitted were Javier Alcala Navarro; Katy Kissel Belfer, a  
broker at CBI International Securities in Mexico City; and Fernando 
Barragan Reyes, a stock broker. 
</P>
<P>
	The verdicts capped a trial that ran nearly two months and  
featured taped evidence allegedly showing defendants processing the 
illicit funds. 
</P>
<P>
	There are three other cases linked to the operation.  
</P>
<P>
	Last month, seven other defendants were indicted for laundering  
money for the Cali cartel and pleaded guilty to charges of 
conspiracy or drug trafficking. Their sentences are pending. 
</P>
<P>
	The other cases involve defendants accused of working for the  
Juarez cartel, and Venezuelan bankers accused of laundering 
millions of U.S. dollars for undercover agents posing as narcotics 
traffickers. 
</P>
<P>
	Two of Mexico's largest banks -- Grupo Financiero Bancomer S.A.  
and Grupo Financiero Serfin S.A. -- have since agreed to pay 
$500,000 in fines and forfeit $13.6 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Chargers were dropped against a third Mexican financial  
institution, Banca Confia, which agreed to forfeit $12.1 million 
seized from its U.S. holdings.

<HEADLINE> Chain Must Tell About Expired Items </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) -- Rite Aid Corp. must inform California  
customers they may have purchased expired products, including 
condoms and baby formula, a judge ruled. 
</P>
<P>
	Superior Court Judge Harry Needham issued a temporary  
restraining order Thursday after district attorneys from three 
counties and one city filed a consumer protection lawsuit earlier 
this week. 
</P>
<P>
	The prosecutors said they inspected Rite Aid stores across the  
state and found that expired condoms, pregnancy tests, infant 
formula and children's medication were being sold. 
</P>
<P>
	Rite Aid has said it would increase efforts to educate staff of  
proper inventory procedure. The Camp Hill, Pa.-based company said 
it would keep following its policy of taking products off the shelf 
60 days before their expiration dates. 
</P>
<P>
	``The action sought today was really unnecessary because Rite  
Aid has been taking actions to solve this problem,'' the company 
said in a statement. ``Furthermore, there is nothing in the 
district attorney's arguments that even allege public harm.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors said they notified Rite Aid in February that expired  
items were being sold and received written assurance that the 
practice would stop. 
</P>
<P>
	Continued inspections at 50 of Rite Aid's 660 California stores  
revealed that outdated products were still being sold, said Merced 
District Attorney Gordon Spencer.

<HEADLINE> Gay Nominee Battle Escalates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The White House is appealing to Senate  
Majority Leader Trent Lott not to block other nominees in an 
escalating dispute over the ambassadorial appointment of an openly 
gay businessman. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Mississippi Republican wants a pledge from Clinton he  
won't circumvent the Senate by announcing controversial 
appointments during short congressional recesses in the future. 
</P>
<P>
	``It has to be stopped,'' said Lott spokesman John Czwartacki.  
</P>
<P>
	Lott remains upset about the president's tactics in naming James  
Hormel, a San Francisco philanthropist and heir to a meatpacking 
fortune, as ambassador to Luxembourg without waiting for Senate 
approval, Czwartacki said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the spokesman said, ``we expect this to be resolved''  
before the dispute threatens key nominations, including Lawrence 
Summers as treasury secretary and Richard Holbrooke as ambassador 
to the United Nations. 
</P>
<P>
	The dispute erupted a week ago when Clinton, tired of waiting  
for the Senate to act on his 1997 nomination of Hormel, installed 
him directly -- invoking a provision in the Constitution permitting 
such appointments during congressional recesses. 
</P>
<P>
	With his ``recess appointment,'' Hormel can serve without Senate  
approval until the end of the next session of Congress -- the end of 
2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Lott denounced the practice, suggesting he was blindsided. And  
Sen. James Inhofe, R-Okla., announced he would seek to block every 
presidential civilian appointment to protest the move. 
</P>
<P>
	White House chief of staff James Podesta, in a letter to Lott,  
took ``significant issue'' with Inhofe's assertion that Clinton 
demonstrated ``contempt for Congress and the Constitution'' in 
circumventing the Senate confirmation process. 
</P>
<P>
	``The debate on Mr. Hormel is not about constitutional  
authority, it is about a very small number of senators who believe 
that sexual orientation can disqualify an exceptional nominee from 
confirmation,'' Podesta wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is unfortunate that Sen. Inhofe now finds cause for  
objection to this process,'' Podesta added. He urged Lott to resist 
joining Inhofe's protest and ``make certain that all of the 
president's nominees receive fair consideration before the full 
Senate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lott has said he agrees with Inhofe's complaints, even though it  
was not his ``inclination'' to place a hold on all other 
nominations ``indefinitely.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Czwartacki said Lott has not changed his position but wants to  
work out a deal with the White House under which the president 
would promise to refrain from springing on the Senate further 
high-profile recess appointments. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sen. Lott does agree with Sen. Inhofe that this practice of  
naming controversial appointments during short recesses without 
much prior consultation is a practice that can't be sustained. It 
has to be stopped,'' Czwartacki said. 
</P>
<P>
	Inhofe said he was only following a precedent set by Sen. Robert  
C. Byrd, D-W.Va., in 1985, when Byrd as minority leader blocked 
President Reagan's appointments until Reagan agreed to refrain from 
further recess appointments. 
</P>
<P>
	Lott wants the same sort of pledge from Clinton, Czwartacki  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	But Podesta, in his letter, said, ``Any fair reading of the  
record of that period demonstrates clearly that Sen. Byrd and 
Senate Democrats simply sought to secure the very consultation and 
courtesies now provided by this administration to Senate 
Republicans.'' 
</P>
<P>
	White House officials said Lott did get advance word of Hormel's  
recess appointment. Republicans said the word came shortly before 
the appointment was announced on the final day of the week-long 
Memorial Day recess. 
</P>
<P>
	By custom, any senator can place a ``hold'' on any nomination.  
But this usually is done on individual nominees, not en masse, and 
the Senate majority leader does not have to honor a hold. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Democrats said that if Inhofe makes good on his  
threat, and it is honored by Lott, they will stage their own 
protest. 
</P>
<P>
	``We would have to respond as well,'' perhaps by seeking to  
block committees from meeting and stalling Republican-sought 
legislation, said Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D.

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton meant no contempt for

without Senate consent, the president's chief of staff told Senate

<HEADLINE> New E-Mail Computer Virus Reported </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The latest computer virus sweeping across the  
Internet is a destructive bug that tricks people by disguising 
itself as a friendly e-mail reply bearing a gift. 
</P>
<P>
	But anyone who opens that ``gift'' uncages a virus named  
``Worm.Explore.Zip'' that hunts through a computer hard drive and 
wipes out the contents of documents, spreadsheets and other 
important files. 
</P>
<P>
	Government and university anti-virus teams were trying Thursday  
to combat the outbreak, which reportedly was first detected in 
Israel earlier this week and has reached at least 12 countries. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's difficult to know right now where we are in the cycle,  
whether this represents the peak'' in the outbreak, said Shawn 
Hernan, a team leader at the Computer Emergency Response Team at 
Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
	Early warnings helped General Electric contain the damage  
Thursday when its system was infected, while Microsoft shut down 
its corporate e-mail system for two hours as a precaution. 
</P>
<P>
	At least one smaller business didn't fare so well.  
</P>
<P>
	``We have the virus,'' Rachel Albert, a spokeswoman for  
InterActive Public Relations of San Francisco, said Thursday. 
``It's terrible. A lot of people lost everything they were working 
on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Because of the way it works, Worm.Explore.Zip actually does not  
fit the technical definition of a computer virus. Instead, software 
experts said, the bug should be classified as a ``Trojan Horse'' -- 
a name borrowed from an ancient battle in which Greek soldiers hid 
inside a wooden horse to launch a surprise attack on the city of 
Troy. 
</P>
<P>
	Either way, the bug poses a serious threat to businesses,  
government agencies and personal computer users. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our belief right now is that it's spreading fairly quickly  
within a site but not as quickly from site to site,'' Hernan said, 
noting that his team is working with an anti-virus group in the 
Department of Defense to contain the outbreak. 
</P>
<P>
	Worm.Explore.Zip arrives with a friendly message: ``Hi  
(Recipient Name)! I received your email and I shall send you a 
reply ASAP. Till then, take a look at the attached zipped docs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The message is harmless unless a person opens the ``zipped  
docs,'' a term referring to a compressed file sent with the e-mail. 
</P>
<P>
	By opening that file, a person unknowingly activates the virus,  
which then uses the computer's e-mail software to send a copy of 
itself to the address of any e-mail that arrives. 
</P>
<P>
	``This one's coming from someone you know, and in response to an  
e-mail you just sent them, so it looks safe,'' said Susan Orbuck, a 
spokeswoman for Trend Micro, a maker of anti-virus software. 
</P>
<P>
	The virus also worms into a computer's hard drive and deletes  
information in files created by popular software, including the 
word processor Microsoft Word and the spreadsheet program Microsoft 
Excel. 
</P>
<P>
	Worm.Explore.Zip is the third major threat to computer networks  
since late March, when the Melissa virus overwhelmed systems with 
floods of e-mail. A more damaging virus named Chernobyl struck in 
late April, but did most of its harm overseas. 
</P>
<P>
	Mark Zajicek, member of the Computer Emergency Response Team  
technical staff at the Software Engineering Institute at Carnegie 
Mellon University, said computer users should be cautious about any 
e-mail with an attachment. 
</P>
<P>
	``If they get this e-mail message or any e-mail with an  
attachment, do not open it,'' Zajicek said. ``Don't click on it, 
don't run it, don't execute it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It is also a good idea for those who have PCs or Windows  
machines to install an anti-virus scanner program, he said.

<HEADLINE> Jim Bakker Moves Into Log Cabin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) -- It's a kind of homecoming for Jim Bakker.  
</P>
<P>
	After spending a year and a half ministering to the poor in  
inner-city Los Angeles, the preacher and his wife of nine months, 
Lori, moved into a log cabin near here this week and is considering 
another televangelism career. 
</P>
<P>
	``My problem is finding out how to support it,'' he said. ``I  
don't want to ever have to raise $1 million every two days like I 
did,'' the 59-year-old Bakker said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bakker's rise and fall revolved around PTL ministries, which he  
moved from Charlotte to Fort Mill, S.C., in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
	With his then-wife, Tammy Faye, by his side, he developed it  
into a Christian theme park, with a daily TV show, shopping mall 
and hotel. In 1987, Bakker admitted to a sexual encounter with 
church secretary Jessica Hahn and his empire crumbled. 
</P>
<P>
	Two years later, he was convicted of defrauding followers of  
$158 million and served five years in federal prison. He and Tammy 
Faye divorced after 30 years of marriage and two children.

<HEADLINE> Spurs' `Pop' Endured Tough Times </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN ANTONIO (AP) -- Only three months ago, Gregg Popovich heard  
boos. Some fans wanted the coach fired. 
</P>
<P>
	Now the San Antonio Spurs are in the NBA Finals, and his critics  
are nowhere to be found. If Popovich takes private pleasure in the 
turn of events, he won't say so. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not about vindication. It's about getting better. We  
started out poorly and we were a poor team. We continued to work. 
We got better and better,'' Popovich said. 
</P>
<P>
	San Antonio, after starting the season 6-8 in February, won 31  
of its last 36 games and captured the Midwest Division and Western 
Conference titles. The top-seeded Spurs are 11-1 in the postseason, 
having swept their last two playoff opponents to reach the finals. 
</P>
<P>
	The Spurs will face the New York Knicks, who beat Indiana 90-82  
in Game 6 Friday night. The finals begin Wednesday in San Antonio. 
</P>
<P>
	Popovich and his players say they don't think much about the  
team's miserable start. 
</P>
<P>
	``We probably thought about it more when we were 6-8, I would  
imagine. But that was a long time ago and a different team, really, 
as far as organization is concerned and our time together,'' 
Popovich said. 
</P>
<P>
	Perhaps the lowest point came Feb. 28, when the Spurs were blown  
out on their home court by longtime nemesis Utah. Popovich was 
tossed from the game with two technicals in the third quarter, so 
he wasn't around for the end of the game and the boos from the 
Alamodome crowd. 
</P>
<P>
	Speculation intensified that Popovich would be ousted as coach.  
</P>
<P>
	``We weren't playing well. They were talking about Pop getting  
fired,'' guard Mario Elie said. ``We weren't playing up to our 
capability.'' 
</P>
<P>
	David Robinson, who'd spent all 10 years of his professional  
career in San Antonio, even became the subject of trade rumors. 
Robinson said the Spurs players knew something had to change -- and 
fast. 
</P>
<P>
	``At that point, you'd better figure out how to string together  
five or six wins in a row,'' Robinson said. ``There were doubts. 
Everybody had doubts. We had to get through it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Two nights after the Utah debacle, life improved for the Spurs  
with a victory at Houston. It was the start of a nine-game winning 
streak that set the tone for the rest of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	``We decided to come together instead of separate,'' Elie said.  
``You learn from that. When you start off tough, you grow as 
individuals and you grow as a team and you realize, hey, you have 
to do whatever it takes to help the team win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Popovich said his only satisfaction comes in feeling happy for  
what his players accomplished. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm proud of them for staying the course and working through  
the hard times to enjoy the good times,'' he said. ``That's our job 
and the guys did it well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Instead of listening to jeers, Popovich now finds himself  
surrounded by the ``Go Spurs Go'' chants of a town jubilant over 
the team's first trip to the finals in its 26-year history in San 
Antonio. Popovich's detractors, if still out there, are silent. 
</P>
<P>
	Popovich is completing his second full season as coach. He  
became the team's general manager in 1994 and took over the 
coaching job after firing Bob Hill in December 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Because he's also the general manager, Popovich had the benefit  
of assembling the team he coaches. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides drafting top pick Tim Duncan in 1997 -- a ``no brainer,''  
as Popovich put it -- he added veterans Elie, Steve Kerr and Jerome 
Kersey this season to give the Spurs more playoff and championship 
experience. 
</P>
<P>
	Reaching the finals feels good, Popovich admits.  
</P>
<P>
	``But there are a lot of people who could take this group to the  
finals,'' he said. ``It's a hell of a group of guys.''

<HEADLINE> Sabres, Hasek Willing To Play Rough </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- The Dallas Stars threw more than pucks at Buffalo  
goalie Dominik Hasek in Game 2 of the Stanley Cup finals. 
</P>
<P>
	Hasek was pounded against the boards, slashed with sticks and  
skates and run into by Stars and Sabres he said were shoved his way 
by Dallas players. 
</P>
<P>
	``They pushed me, fell on me,'' Hasek said following a 4-2 loss  
Thursday night. ``I was on my knees and they pushed my defensemen 
into me. I don't like it. ... It's very dangerous.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sabres coach Lindy Ruff said he believes the Stars were going  
after his top player. He was especially critical of Brian Skrudland 
jarring Hasek in open ice, a play that drew a penalty for 
interference. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it is obviously intent,'' Ruff said. ``Skrudland's  
only hit of the game just happened to be our goaltender. That's the 
only guy he can track down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The NHL released a copy of the rule explaining Skrudland's  
violation. 
</P>
<P>
	``A goalkeeper is NOT `fair game' just because he is outside the  
goal crease area,'' the statement said. ``A penalty for 
interference or charging should be called in every case where an 
opposing player makes unnecessary contact with a goalkeeper.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ruff also criticized Dallas' Mike Modano for ``slew-footing''  
Hasek. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was definitely a cheap shot,'' Ruff said.  
</P>
<P>
	Forward Guy Carbonneau said the Stars were trying to harass  
Hasek, not hurt him. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not trying to run the goalie,'' he said. ``It's in the  
game plan of every team to screen the goalie and give him 
trouble.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``If he wandered out of his net, that was one of our focuses was  
to do that,'' said Joe Nieuwendyk, who tangled with Hasek several 
times. 
</P>
<P>
	As the first period ended, Nieuwendyk made contact with Hasek  
twice on the same possession. When the horn sounded, both teams 
ended up in an all-out brawl. Six players were penalized for 18 
minutes because of the melee. 
</P>
<P>
	Hasek said he wasn't surprised the Stars were more physical than  
in Game 1, but he wondered how much of it was legal. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have to be ready for everything, even after a whistle,''  
he said. ``I think the referees should see it, too.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hasek admitted he lost his cool after some of the hits. But he  
doesn't think it led to any of Dallas' three goals against him. The 
Stars' game-capping score came with an empty net. 
</P>
<P>
	``Of course I got mad,'' he said. ``But after a couple of  
seconds, I focused on the game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stars goalie Ed Belfour said he's ready for whatever happens in  
Game 3. 
</P>
<P>
	``Each game will probably get more physical in the corners and  
in front of the net,'' Belfour said. ``It should make for a great 
series.''

<HEADLINE> Actor DeForest Kelley Dead at 79 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Actor DeForest Kelley, who as crusty Dr.  
Leonard ``Bones'' McCoy on ``Star Trek'' brought a country flavor 
to outer space, died Friday. He was 79. 
</P>
<P>
	Kelley died after an extended illness, said Carol Pfannkuche,  
spokeswoman for the Motion Picture and Television Country Home and 
Hospital, a retirement facility, in suburban Woodland Hills. 
</P>
<P>
	``DeForest Kelley was a Southern gentleman all of his life -- a  
kind, good, wonderful friend,'' said William Shatner, who played 
the show's lead character Capt. James T. Kirk. ``I will miss him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Flowers were being placed on Kelley's Walk of Fame star, the  
Hollywood Chamber of Commerce said. 
</P>
<P>
	``He represented humanity and it fitted him well,'' said Leonard  
Nimoy, who played Mr. Spock on the science fiction saga. ``He was a 
decent, loving, caring partner and will be deeply missed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The conflict between McCoy's all-too-human character and Spock's  
cold logic provided grist for many of the lighthearted moments in 
the television series and ``Star Trek'' movies. 
</P>
<P>
	His Dr. McCoy was one of a colorful crew of 23rd-century space  
travelers that helped make the original ``Star Trek'' television 
series a lasting cult favorite, although the program aired only 
from 1966-69 on NBC. 
</P>
<P>
	The ``Star Trek'' phenomenon lived on in feature films and in a  
series of TV and movie spin-offs, including ``Star Trek: The Next 
Generation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm just a country doctor!'' McCoy would exclaim when called  
on to cope with the other-worldly illnesses and calamities that 
beset the USS Enterprise, but he would always come through for his 
captain. 
</P>
<P>
	Bones hardly went an episode without arguing with Spock or  
complaining. ``No. I'm a doctor, not a mechanic,'' he said in one 
episode, and ``I'm a doctor not a bricklayer'' in another. 
</P>
<P>
	Born Jackson DeForest Kelley Jan. 20, 1920, in Atlanta, he  
played supporting roles in a number of movies, including ``The Man 
in the Gray Flannel Suit'' (1956); ``Gunfight at the O.K. Corral'' 
and ``Raintree County'' (1957) and ``Apache Uprising'' (1966). 
</P>
<P>
	His part in ``Star Trek,'' which was created by Gene  
Roddenberry, brought Kelley out of relative obscurity and into the 
popular culture limelight. He played in six of the sci-fi films, 
including ``Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country'' in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
	Kelley didn't object to being typecast as McCoy.  
</P>
<P>
	``He loved it. He loved that series so much,'' said A.C. Lyles,  
a friend and longtime Paramount Studios producer who knew Kelley 
for five decades. 
</P>
<P>
	Lyles recalled how Kelley went up for a leading role in ``This  
Gun for Hire'' in 1940, losing out to Alan Ladd but gaining a 
Paramount contract and regular roles in Westerns. 
</P>
<P>
	``I always used him as a heavy, a mean man, and he was marvelous  
at that,'' Lyles said. In real life, Kelley was known for his great 
sense of humor and his skill at growing roses, his friend said. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to ``Star Trek,'' he made appearances on dozens of  
television shows, including ``Gunsmoke'' and ``Bonanza.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kelley is survived by his wife of nearly 55 years, Carolyn

<HEADLINE> Costner Will Attend College Series </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OMAHA, Neb. (AP) -- The Titans made the College World Series, and  
Kevin Costner will come. 
</P>
<P>
	Cal State-Fullerton sports information director Mel Franks said  
the actor was scheduled to fly into Omaha on Saturday for the 
Titans' game against Stanford. 
</P>
<P>
	Costner, a Cal State-Fullerton alum, attended the series in 1995  
when the Titans won the championship. He was expected to arrive 
Saturday by private jet. 
</P>
<P>
	Franks said the star of ``Bull Durham,'' ``Field of Dreams,''  
``Dances With Wolves'' and ``Waterworld'' was hoping for just one 
thing in Omaha -- a game of catch. 
</P>
<P>
	``He wants to be in the dugout but the NCAA said no,'' Franks  
said. ``He's bringing his glove.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Costner's agent, Steven Rivers, confirmed late Friday that  
Costner would attend. Franks said Costner hoped to participate in 
infield or batting practice before Saturday's game between the 
Titans and Stanford. 
</P>
<P>
	``If they'd let him, he'd ride on the bus with them and take  
(batting practice) and everything,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *HIGHLIGHT REEL:* Call it the consequences of making the play.  
</P>
<P>
	Jason Van Arkel, 23, suffered a bruised knee when he fell  
backward over the left field wall while trying to keep a beach ball 
from floating onto the field at Rosenblatt Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a hero,'' said Steve Lefeber, 42, of Omaha, another fan  
in the left field bleachers. 
</P>
<P>
	Van Arkel was helped off the field by grounds crew members but  
returned a short time later to cheers and a brief ovation. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know how I'm a hero,'' he said sheepishly. ``I just  
fell over the wall. 
</P>
<P>
	``I started to fall headfirst, and I just grabbed the wall and  
landed on my knee,'' said Van Arkel, an overnight news producer for 
an Omaha radio station. 
</P>
<P>
	Van Arkel said he has been coming to the College World Series  
for years, but never with such an eventful day. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was afraid they'd kick me out,'' he said. ``But they let me  
back in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One bystander called the episode ``the most exciting part'' of  
the nearly four-hour game. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *BIG RED MACHINE:* There's only one thing that could push aside  
coverage of the College World Series in Omaha: Nebraska Cornhuskers 
football. 
</P>
<P>
	In Friday's sports section of the Omaha World-Herald, the  
College World Series and Stanley Cup finals competed with news 
about the recovery of injured Nebraska quarterback Bobby Newcombe. 
</P>
<P>
	Newcombe missed most of last season with a torn knee ligament  
and had surgery in December. He rejoined his teammates this week 
during informal offseason workouts and continues to do 
rehabilitation work. 
</P>
<P>
	Newcombe wore no pads and didn't even participate in every  
exercise. But it was a start -- and it was section-front news in 
football-crazed Nebraska. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *PLAYING TAG:* Oklahoma State had a painful first day -- in more  
ways than one. 
</P>
<P>
	Josh Holliday was hit twice by pitches in the Cowboys' 11-2 loss  
to Alabama. That tied a College World Series record and made 
Holliday the 18th player in CWS history to be hit twice in a game. 
</P>
<P>
	Pinch-hitter Chris Becerra also was hit by a pitch, bringing  
Oklahoma State's season total to 96. The previous school record was 
84 in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *EVERYTHING'S POLITICAL:* Rep. Lee Terry, R-Neb., used the start  
of the College World Series to increase his political profile, 
holding a fund-raiser at the adjacent Henry Doorly Zoo. 
</P>
<P>
	The event was expected to raise about $100,000 for the National  
Republican Congressional Committee, committee spokeswoman Jill 
Schroeder said. 
</P>
<P>
	Seven Republican congressmen were scheduled to attend a  
reception and Friday's games, including Rep. John Thune of South 
Dakota, Nebraska Reps. Doug Bereuter and Bill Barrett and Rep. 
Frank Lucas of Oklahoma -- whose Oklahoma State Cowboys played 
Alabama in the series opener. 
</P>
<P>
	Schroeder said it is not uncommon for politicians to  
``piggyback'' such fund-raising events onto a sports event like the 
College World Series or the Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's fun,'' she said. ``And it's not the same old rubber  
chicken dinner.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *ROLL TIDE:* Alabama shortstop Andy Phillips extended his  
hitting streak to 34 games Friday, breaking a tie with Louisiana 
State's Todd Walker for the Southeastern Conference record. 
</P>
<P>
	Phillips singled to left in the third inning against Oklahoma  
State. He then stole second base, but was stranded there. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *STAMP OF APPROVAL:* The U.S. Postal Service has added its 33  
cents to the College World Series. 
</P>
<P>
	The post office opened a temporary branch just outside  
Rosenblatt Stadium that will be open during the series. 
</P>
<P>
	The post office is across the street from the community of  
recreational vehicles known as ``Dingerville.'' The Postal Service 
said customers could buy special pictorial stamps, envelopes, 
regular stamps and other items.

<HEADLINE> Agent Says Johnson To Run on Own </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TORONTO (AP) -- The Ben Johnson saga took another bizarre twist  
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Morris Chrobotek, Johnson's agent, wanted the sprinter to  
compete Saturday at a meet in Kitchener, Ontario. But mindful that 
anyone who runs in a race with Johnson is subject to suspension 
until his reinstatement appeal is dealt with by the International 
Amateur Athletic Federation, Chrobotek said Johnson would run 
against the clock, rather than other competitors. 
</P>
<P>
	The idea was to show the 37-year-old Johnson can run under the  
Canadian 100-meter standard of 10.6 seconds, the time needed to 
qualify for the national championships. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Ontario Track and Field Association said if Johnson  
wants to run, he has to do it before or after the meet -- not as 
part of it. 
</P>
<P>
	Association director Cecil Smith said the decision was made  
because had Johnson run, all meet competitors would face 
disqualification under the IAAF's ``contamination rule.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't want to hurt or contaminate anyone,'' Chrobotek said.  
``We just want to show that Ben is capable of running under the 
standard. 
</P>
<P>
	``All I'm looking for is someone to fire the gun and let him  
take off from the blocks. Ben can't contaminate a clock, can he?'' 
</P>
<P>
	The IAAF, track's world governing body, banned Johnson after a  
second positive drug test in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson, who raced against a car and two horses in a charity  
event earlier this year, already has tried to register to compete 
at the Canadian championships. But Athletics Canada denied the 
application for the June 25-27 meet at Winnipeg because Johnson 
remains under suspension until the IAAF rules on his reinstatement 
appeal Aug. 17. 
</P>
<P>
	Arbitrator Graeme Mew ruled April 19 that Johnson be reinstated  
in Canada because Canadian track authorities failed to make all of 
Johnson's appeal options clear in 1993. But the report stated 
Johnson couldn't compete in Canada before the IAAF decided his 
fate. 
</P>
<P>
	Even if Johnson runs under 10.6 and the IAAF deems him eligible  
for the Canadian championships, he couldn't compete because he 
didn't beat the standard at a sanctioned competition. 
</P>
<P>
	That doesn't bother Chrobotek.  
</P>
<P>
	``We'll be there no matter what,'' Chrobotek said. ``If they  
want to recognize it, they will. If they don't, they don't. It 
won't be our problem.''

<HEADLINE> Wis. Van Driver Sentenced to Prison </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JANESVILLE, Wis. (AP) -- The driver in a van crash that killed  
seven young people selling magazines door-to-door was sentenced 
Friday to seven years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	Turning aside Jeremy Holmes' tearful apology, Rock County  
Circuit Judge John Roethe ordered that Holmes, 20, also serve four 
years on probation. 
</P>
<P>
	Fourteen people age 15 to 22 were in the van headed back to  
their hotel March 25 when Holmes lost control on Interstate 90 near 
Janesville. Seven were killed and five others were seriously 
injured after being thrown from the van. 
</P>
<P>
	Holmes pleaded guilty April 15 to multiple counts of vehicular  
homicide and causing great bodily harm. 
</P>
<P>
	The police complaint -- which Holmes' lawyer has said is accurate  
-- said Holmes was going 81 mph, did not have a valid driver's 
license and saw a police car about to pull him over. He panicked 
and tried to switch places with a passenger, causing him to lose 
control. 
</P>
<P>
	Rock County District Attorney David O'Leary was seeking  
unspecified prison time on the vehicular homicide counts -- which 
carried a maximum of 14 years in prison -- and probation for the 
other charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Public defender Brenna Lisowski argued that Holmes should not  
have to serve any prison time, saying he was ``not a criminal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sobbing, Holmes told the judge: ``Your honor, there's a lot that  
I could say about how I feel, and I do take responsibility for the 
accident. What it comes to -- I'm sorry.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the judge said jail time was necessary because of the  
``nature and gravity of this offense.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The magazine sales crew worked for YES, which recruits young  
people and sends them crisscrossing the country selling 
subscriptions that are then processed under a contract with a 
company called Subscriptions Plus. 
</P>
<P>
	The companies are now under investigation both in Wisconsin and  
in Oklahoma, where Subscriptions Plus is based. The U.S. Labor 
Department is also investigating Subscriptions Plus, and civil 
suits from families of the dead and injured are pending.

	 *Pentagon: No Rush on Peacekeepers    	
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- NATO said today a ``substantial'' peacekeeping  
force would be in place in Kosovo by tomorrow afternoon, but 
officials in Europe and at the Pentagon were vague on the details. 
There should be no rush to put troops in danger, the Pentagon said. 
American, British and other troops assigned to secure the province 
as Serb troops depart milled around the Kosovo border, ready to 
move when they get the word. An elite unit of British paratroopers 
and Gurkha riflemen was to go first.

	Clinton Warns of Kosovo Dangers  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton said today Americans must be  
prepared for possible casualties as the difficult work of 
peacekeeping begins in Kosovo. At Whiteman Air Force Base in 
Missouri, Clinton thanked B-2 pilots who flew 30-hour roundtrips to 
the Balkans. ``Thanks to you, the century is ending not with 
helpless indignation over such unspeakable cruelty, but with its 
opposite -- a ringing affirmation by free people of human dignity,'' 
Clinton said.

Midwest fund-raisers. ``See you in Iowa,'' he said after a private 
$1,000-a-plate luncheon at a Chicago hotel. Tomorrow, Bush visits 
Iowa, site of the nation's first caucuses. On Monday, he goes to

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- According to financial disclosure forms  
released today, many senators and their spouses are worth millions, 
a select few many times that. Among the richest in 1998 were John 
D. Rockefeller IV, D-W.Va.; Herb Kohl, D-Wis.; Edward M. Kennedy, 
D-Mass.; Frank Lautenberg, D-N.J., and freshman Peter Fitzgerald, 
R-Ill. The rank-and-file salary is $136,700, with floor leaders

	Wholesale Inflation Eases  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Inflation at the wholesale level tapered off  
in May after rising sharply the month before. The Producer Price 
Index, which measures inflation pressures before they reach the 
consumer, rose just 0.2 percent last month. A separate report by 
the Commerce Department said retail sales rose by a hefty 1 percent 
last month, led by a sharp 2.5 percent increase in auto purchases.

	Vatican, Lutherans End Dispute  
</P>
<P>
	GENEVA (AP) -- The Roman Catholic and Lutheran churches have  
ended a nearly 5-century-old dispute over how people achieve 
salvation, officials announced today. The accord represents ``a 
decisive step forward in the process of reconciliation,'' said Rev. 
Ismael Noko, general secretary of the Lutheran World Federation. 
The two sides crafted a compromise on ``justification,'' or how 
humankind achieves salvation. For the Lutherans, salvation depends 
on the grace of God, while Catholics maintain that good works are 
also involved. The declaration states that divine forgiveness comes 
``solely by God's grace'' and that good works flow from that.

main Web site today, the second such assault on the high-profile 
Internet page in just over two weeks. The hackers defaced the Web 
page, www.senate.gov, but left its overall look similar to how it 
normally appears. The FBI already was investigating a May 27 attack 
on the Web site.

	SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- A computer crash forced the online

Wall Street. The halt came after eBay tried to launch a revamped 
version of its Web site. The computer server went down last night,

Wednesday in compensatory damages.

<HEADLINE> Lawyer Sentenced in Drug Laundering </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- A lawyer was sentenced to five years in prison  
Friday for laundering money on behalf of Colombian drug kingpins 
who were his clients. 
</P>
<P>
	William Moran was convicted last summer along with Michael  
Abbell, a former Justice Department extradition expert. His 
sentencing was delayed. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors said the lawyers went beyond just zealously  
representing their clients, members of the now-defunct Cali drug 
cartel, and actually took part in their crimes by transferring 
money to jailed cartel members and their families. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense attorneys said Moran and Abbell may have acted  
unethically, but they in no way helped the cartel run its drug 
smuggling business. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, the judge overturned a racketeering conspiracy  
conviction against Abbell and Moran, agreeing they did not take 
part in drug smuggling. 
</P>
<P>
	Four other lawyers indicted in the case have pleaded guilty to  
lesser charges.

<HEADLINE> Wholesale Inflation Eases in May </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Inflation at the wholesale level tapered off  
in May after rising sharply the month before. Still-confident 
Americans, meanwhile, kept buying everything from clothes to cars. 
</P>
<P>
	The Producer Price Index, which measures inflation pressures  
before they reach the consumer, rose just 0.2 percent last month, 
reflecting a drop in gasoline prices, which posted a record 
increase the month before, the Labor Department said Friday. 
Wholesale prices in April had gone up 0.5 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	A separate report by the Commerce Department said retail sales  
rose by a hefty 1 percent last month, led by a sharp 2.5 percent 
increase in auto purchases. Retail sales have climbed or held 
steady for 10 months running and were 7.8 percent higher than May 
of last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``The American consumer appears to have an insatiable appetite,'  
said Oscar Gonzalez, an economist with John Hancock. 
</P>
<P>
	The tame wholesale inflation, while good news, didn't offset  
economists' belief that the Fed may be concerned that strong retail 
sales figure is a sign that the nation's economy, powered by 
consumer spending, is growing too quickly and could touch off 
inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	Many economists said they were looking for the Fed to start  
raising interest rates at its next meeting, June 29-30. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's lots of momentum in retail sales,'' said economist Tim  
O'Neill with Harris Bank and the Bank of Montreal. ``If you are 
worried about the inflation speedometer, then you'll need to slow 
down consumer gas, which fuels the economic engine, and that would 
happen by the Fed raising interest rates.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cynthia Latta, an economist with DRI/McGraw Hill, said other  
factors the Fed may use to justify a rate increase were reports 
this week that struggling overseas economies, including Japan's, 
may be gaining strength, which could push up global price 
pressures. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Fed is concerned, I think, that the U.S. economy is so  
strong and that with other economies perhaps starting to turn the 
corner and recover, there will be an increase in global demand,'' 
Latta said. 
</P>
<P>
	The moderation in wholesale prices in May reflected a big drop  
in energy prices. Gasoline prices at the wholesale level, which had 
risen by a record 29.1 percent in April, dropped 2.7 percent last 
month. 
</P>
<P>
	That moderation is expected to show up in retail prices. Many  
analysts are forecasting an increase of around 0.2 percent in the 
May Consumer Price Index, which will be released next Wednesday, 
down from a nine-year high of 0.7 percent in April. 
</P>
<P>
	After the CPI increase was reported last month, the Fed  
announced that it was leaning toward raising interest rates to keep 
inflation from getting out of control. 
</P>
<P>
	Financial markets remained on alert for a Fed rate increase. The  
Dow Jones industrial average closed at 10,490.51, down 130.76 
points, and the yield on Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond remained 
above the 6 percent level, a threshhold indicating nervousness 
about the central bank's intentions. 
</P>
<P>
	For May, the 2.7 percent drop in gasoline prices, the biggest  
decline since last December, offset increases in home heating oil 
and natural gas, leaving overall energy costs unchanged for the 
month following a 5.1 percent surge in April. 
</P>
<P>
	Motorists are already starting to see the price declines at the  
wholesale level at the pump. Surveys show that gasoline pump 
prices, after having risen for more than two months, have started 
to edge down slightly. 
</P>
<P>
	Food prices last month rose 0.5 percent after a big 0.9 percent  
drop in April. The May increase included a big jump in pork prices. 
Fruit prices were also up sharply, with big gains for grapefruit, 
lemons and pears. 
</P>
<P>
	However, vegetable prices fell last month as the price of  
cauliflower, squash and lettuce all posted big declines. 
</P>
<P>
	Excluding the volatile food and energy sectors, prices at the  
wholesale level rose a tiny 0.1 percent, matching the small 
increase in April. So far this year, the so-called core rate of 
inflation at the wholesale level has been flat, an even better 
performance than a 1.9 percent rate of increase in the first five 
months of 1998.

<HEADLINE> NBC, AT&AMP;T To Bring HDTV to Cable </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- AT&AMP;T will soon be providing NBC programs in  
high-definition television through its cable TV lines. 
</P>
<P>
	An eight-year deal announced Thursday between AT&AMP;T Broadband &AMP;  
Internet Services and NBC is one of the first HDTV partnerships 
between a cable company and a broadcaster. 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement also commits AT&AMP;T Broadband &AMP; Internet to carrying  
NBC's cable services MSNBC and CNBC, and the network's Olympics 
programming, according to a statement released by the companies. 
</P>
<P>
	Cable operators previously had said they did not have enough  
capacity to carry HDTV programming because it eats up too much 
space on cable TV systems. 
</P>
<P>
	``This new agreement, which will bring great value and benefit  
to our customers well into the next decade, demonstrates that the 
cable industry and broadcasters can amicably reach agreement on 
important matters,'' Leo J. Hindrey Jr., president and CEO of AT&AMP;T 
Broadband and Internet, said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	The two companies said they will not only work to provide  
digital programming for new high-definition television sets, but 
also for traditional TVs through set-top boxes that will be 
compatible with high-definition signals. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal regulators now require stations in the 10 largest U.S.  
cities to send digital signals. This fall, another 20 cities will 
face that requirement. 
</P>
<P>
	The few television shows that are currently shot in digital  
format, including ``The Tonight Show With Jay Leno,'' are still 
converted to analog for most viewers. 
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T Broadband &AMP; Internet, formerly known as Tele-Communications  
Inc. prior to a merger with New York-based AT&AMP;T, has more than 10 
million customers nationwide.

<HEADLINE> Knicks Coach Has Become Risk-Taker  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Jeff Van Gundy tinkered with his starting lineup  
before Game 4, inserting Latrell Sprewell and removing Kurt Thomas. 
In Game 5, he saved Marcus Camby until after the first 10 minutes 
of the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	What does Van Gundy have up his sleeve for Game 6?  
</P>
<P>
	The coach of the New York Knicks has become a risk-taker in the  
Eastern Conference finals, which resume tonight at Madison Square 
Garden with his team leading the Indiana Pacers 3-2 in the 
best-of-7 series. 
</P>
<P>
	``By starting Latrell, it was neither genius last night nor  
stupidity in Game 4,'' Van Gundy said Thursday. ``It was what I 
felt was in the best interest of the team. That's how I make every 
decision.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Van Gundy took a lot of criticism when the Sprewell move seemed  
to backfire in Game 4. But those same critics were lauding the move 
after Game 5 when Sprewell unleashed an array of offensive moves 
and had his best game of the series with 29 points. 
</P>
<P>
	With Camby, the coach decided to keep him out for the bulk of  
the third quarter because he had three fouls. He wanted Camby 
available for the entire fourth quarter, and he didn't want him 
playing tentatively because of foul trouble. 
</P>
<P>
	The move paid off.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm just really thankful that I'm a part of a team that's  
still playing,'' Van Gundy said. ``And what small part I play in 
it, I take very seriously. I do the job the best I can. '' 
</P>
<P>
	In this case, it means departing from what got the Knicks here  
and taking a gamble or two to try to help offset the loss of 
Patrick Ewing. 
</P>
<P>
	Van Gundy has been no stranger to criticism this season, and the  
internal disagreements over his spotty use of Camby earlier in the 
season led to the demotion of general manager Ernie Grunfeld. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you become paralyzed by the thought that you may be  
criticized for doing something, you're never going to be the risk 
taker you need to be as a good coach. Risk taking is part of it. If 
it doesn't work out, you've got to accept the responsibility for it 
not working out,'' Van Gundy said. 
</P>
<P>
	If the Knicks make the NBA Finals, an option year in Van Gundy's  
contract worth $3.5 million becomes guaranteed. He is due to make 
$2 million next season, the same amount as new Orlando Magic head 
coach Doc Rivers. 
</P>
<P>
	Not since Game 7 of the 1994 Eastern Conference finals, also  
against Indiana, has New York had a chance to make it to the 
championship round and go for the franchise's first title since 
1973. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd like to do it for our fans at home,'' Sprewell said. ``I'd  
like to finish Indiana off there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It's an improbable scenario these Knicks find themselves in the  
second week of June. After a season of underachieving, bickering, 
backstabbing and barely qualifying for the playoffs, they stand 
poised to become the lowest-seeded team ever to make the finals. 
</P>
<P>
	``No one thought we would be where we are now,'' said Camby, who  
has emerged as a force in this series. ``Just the opportunity to go 
to the finals is a dream come true for most of us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	What the Pacers have going for them heading into Game 6, aside  
from their advantages in depth and experience, is the Knicks' 
recent history of failing to seize the moment and make things easy 
on themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	In the first round, they had an opportunity to finish off the  
Miami Heat in Game 4 at the Garden, but lost. 
</P>
<P>
	In this round, they had an opportunity in Game 4 to take a  
commanding 3-1 lead at home, but lost. 
</P>
<P>
	``The biggest thing right now for us is how do we break the  
cycle of win, lose, win, lose,'' Van Gundy said. ``It's very 
difficult to win two in a row in the playoffs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Knicks will need to repeat all the things they forgot about  
in Game 4 and did well in Game 5 -- pushing the ball upcourt, 
attacking the basket, hitting the open man, playing aggressively 
rather than tentatively. 
</P>
<P>
	For the Pacers, everything that was present in Game 4 but  
missing in Game 5 -- contributions from reserves Jalen Rose and 
Antonio Davis, energy and offensive aggression from Mark Jackson 
and Chris Mullin, speed getting back on defense -- needs to reappear 
in Game 6. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the 11 conference finals tied at 2-2 in this decade, 10 have  
gone to the team that won Game 5. The exception was in 1994, when 
Miller scored 25 fourth-quarter points to beat the Knicks in the 
Garden, only to have the Knicks come back to win Game 6 in Indiana 
and Game 7 at home.

<HEADLINE> Mrs. Dole Announces Farm Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- Republican presidential candidate  
Elizabeth Dole unveiled a 10-point farm program Friday aimed at 
increasing exports, giving farmers new tax breaks and bolstering 
the struggling livestock industry. 
</P>
<P>
	In remarks prepared for delivery Saturday to the World Pork  
Expo, Mrs. Dole declared ``farm families are America's heart and 
soul.'' Aides said her proposal will resonate in a key political 
state where the farm economy has suffered. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Dole will call for allowing farmers to deduct 100 percent  
of their health insurance costs, and for elimination of the federal 
inheritance tax on family farms. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, she will call on the Clinton administration to  
release $145 million in emergency assistance approved by Congress 
and propose new legislation forcing meatpackers to disclose the 
prices they pay for animals. 
</P>
<P>
	Her speech will underscore her support for ethanol-blended  
fuels, a key issue popular in Iowa because ethanol is distilled 
from corn and offers a new market for farmers. 
</P>
<P>
	Aides said her package offers a sharp contrast with front-runner  
Texas Gov. George W. Bush, who rivals criticize for being vague on 
the issues. The ethanol issue also presents a problem for an 
oil-state governor unlikely to champion the cause. 
</P>
<P>
	``Pork producers, cattle ranchers and farmers need help,'' Mrs.  
Dole said in her prepared remarks. ``They shouldn't have to wait 
for Washington bureaucrats to get what they deserve.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bush is certain to get huge attention on Saturday when he makes  
his initial foray into Iowa, where precinct caucuses launch the 
nominating season. He's ahead in virtually all early polling, but 
Mrs. Dole served notice she has no intention of yielding the stage 
to Bush. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Dole headed into the state for a weekend swing, and went  
out of her way to offer a contrast with Bush. While Bush is helping 
two congressmen raise money, Mrs. Dole will speak at the Pork Expo 
and then attend a down-home ice cream social. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is just another chance to meet real Iowans and talk about  
real issues,'' said aide Monte Shaw. 
</P>
<P>
	While unemployment is low and the nation's economy solid,  
farmers have suffered with low commodity prices, particularly in 
the pork industry. That's important in Iowa, the nation's largest 
pork producing state accounting for about 25 percent of the 
country's output. 
</P>
<P>
	Requiring meatpackers to disclose the prices they pay is an  
important issue, because many pork producers suspect that packers 
cut sweetheart deals with giant mega-hog operations. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's only fair that all producers know the going rate for  
hogs,'' Mrs. Dole said. ``Free markets depend on the free flow of 
information. On a level playing field, everyone can win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Other pieces of her farm package include:  
</P>
<P>
	--Boosting exports under the Food for Peace program, and fully  
utilizing the Conservation Reserve Program. That's designed to take 
36.4 million of environmentally fragile acres out of production, 
but only 30 million have been set aside. 
</P>
<P>
	--Calling for China's entry into the World Trade Organization, a  
move targeting a giant market but vehemently opposed by 
conservatives. 
</P>
<P>
	--Pushing for enactment of free-trade legislation, including  
giving the president the authority to negotiate ``fast track'' 
trade deals. 
</P>
<P>
	--Calling for a Western Hemisphere free-trading zone and for  
breaking down barriers to trade with the European Union. 
</P>
<P>
	The tax issues are major complaints of farmers.  
</P>
<P>
	As independent business operators, they must provide for their  
own health insurance. While companies can deduct the cost of 
providing health coverage for workers, farmers cannot. 
</P>
<P>
	The estate tax issue is also important, because many farmers  
worry that their operations will have to be sold on their death to 
pay the taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's wrong to make farmers visit Uncle Sam and the undertaker  
on the same day,'' Mrs. Dole declared. 
</P>
<P>
	There was no pricetag set on her farm package, to be offered  
during one of the state's most hectic political weekends. In 
addition to Dole and Bush, Ohio Rep. John Kasich, former Tennessee 
Governor Lamar Alexander and conservative activist Gary Bauer were 
stumping in the state.

<HEADLINE> Suspected Nazi Leaves U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A retiree identified by the United States as a  
Nazi guard at slave labor camps in Poland has left the country and 
renounced his U.S. citizenship, authorities say. 
</P>
<P>
	Dmytro Sawchuk, 74, had been charged in U.S. District Court in  
New York City with failing to tell U.S. officials of his alleged 
Nazi past when he applied for a visa to enter the country in 1951. 
</P>
<P>
	The civil complaint sought to revoke his citizenship.  
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Attorney Mary Jo White said the case became moot when, on  
March 23, Sawchuk renounced his citizenship and surrendered his 
U.S. passport at the U.S. consulate in Frankfurt, Germany. 
</P>
<P>
	Sawchuk allegedly guarded Nazi slave-labor camps from 1943 to  
1945 and participated in the liquidation of a Jewish ghetto in 
Nazi-occupied Poland. He told authorities he spent the war years as 
a farm worker in his native Poland, and also worked at a German 
sawmill. 
</P>
<P>
	Sawchuk, a retired tailor, had lived with his wife and two sons  
in Glen Spey, a small Catskills town about 65 miles northwest of 
New York. A telephone call to Sawchuk's lawyer for comment was not 
returned Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. government has placed Sawchuk's name on its ``watch  
list,'' which bars him from returning to the United States, 
prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
	Eli Rosenbaum, director of the Office of Special Investigations  
in the Justice Department's Criminal Division, said the action 
against Sawchuk was ``one more step in the government's ongoing 
efforts to identify and take legal action against former 
participants in Nazi persecution residing in this country.''
