<HEADLINE> Venezuelan President to Visit Algeria Monday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ALGIERS, August 13 (Xinhua) -- Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez
will arrive here Monday for a two-day official visit to Algeria,
the Algerian news agency reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The visit is part of Chavez's ongoing tour of the member states
of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), which
is aimed at inviting OPEC members to attend the second summit
meeting of the oil cartel, which is slated for September in the
Venezuelan capital of Caracas.
</P>
<P>
It also comes in the context of boosting the friendly relations
between the two countries, said the report.
</P>
<P>
During his stay, Chavez will discuss with his Algerian
counterpart Abdel Aziz Bouteflika the situation in the world oil
markets and means of achieving harmony inside OPEC to secure prices
stability. They will also seek new ways to enhance bilateral
cooperation in all fields.
</P>
<P>
The meeting between the two sides will also focus on
arrangements being made for the OPEC summit meeting.
</P>
<P>
During the talks, the revival of the bilateral relations,
notably in the economic field, will be on top of the agenda.
</P>
<P>
The volume of bilateral trade, estimated at 20 million U.S.
dollars annually, is relatively low compared to their huge
resources, said the report.
</P>
<P>
The two sides are expected to sign a memorandum on political and
economic consultations and issues of mutual interest.

<HEADLINE> UAE Communication Ministry to Take Over National Meteorological Service System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, August 13 (Xinhua) -- The Communications Ministry of
the United Arab Emirates (UAE) will take over the complete
operation of the National Meteorological Service system at the end
of the year, the official news agency WAM reported on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The National Meteorological Service started operation in the
Emirates eight years ago in cooperation with the United Nations
Development Program (UNDP) and the World Meteorological
Organization (WMO).
</P>
<P>
The transition process, which started in February, will be
operated in parallel with the Ministry of Communications until the
end of this year, said Dr. Abdel Sabour Khalil, WMO consultant and
the project's chief technical advisor.
</P>
<P>
The National Meteorological Service, the establishment of which
began in January 1992, was not completed until the national bank
for meteorological data was set up for collecting all
meteorological data in the country for maintenance and repairs, as
well as for the testing and calibration of the meteorological
systems last year.

CAIRO -- Any concessions on Jerusalem by the Palestinians would
prompt violence and terrorist acts that can not be controlled in
the Middle East, Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak warned on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"The issue of Jerusalem is the most dangerous and difficult at
the current stage of the Palestinian-Israeli peace talks," Mubarak
said in an interview with Rose al-Youssef weekly carried in its
Sunday edition.
</P>
<P>
"Any Palestinian concessions on Jerusalem will spark an
explosion of the situation in the region in a way that no one will
be able to control," he said, adding that "terrorists will come
back and find strong justification for their actions." (BC-Mubarak-

<HEADLINE> Syria Begins Sending Water to Amman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, August 13 (Xinhua) -- Syria on Sunday started sending
3.5 million cubic meters of water to its neighbor Jordan.
</P>
<P>
The water was flowing from the Basil al-Assad dam in southern
Syria to the King Abdullah dam in Jordan via the Yarmouk river on
the two countries' border.
</P>
<P>
The water is traveling to Jordan at a rate of 600 liters per
second and all of it will arrive at the Jordanian capital Amman by
October 21.
</P>
<P>
Syrian President Bashar al-Assad approved to supply Jordan with
water during his recent meeting with Jordanian King Abdullah Bin
Hussein in Damascus on July 19.
</P>
<P>
The Jordanian-Syrian water joint committee has reviewed in its
recent meeting the methods of water flowing to secure the arrival
of the water allocated for Jordan.
</P>
<P>
Syria has already supplied Jordan with some 8 million cubic
meters of water to help Jordan deal with the problem of water
shortage suffered by many cities.
</P>
<P>
Jordan is one of the poorest Arab countries in water resources
and is suffering from an aggravating shortage in water due to its
rising population and the expansion in using water for different
purposes.

<HEADLINE> UAE Calls for Just, Comprehensive Peace in Middle East </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, August 13 (Xinhua) -- A just and comprehensive peace
will be achieved in the Middle East only by the implementation of
international resolutions and resumption of peace talks on all
tracks, a senior commander of United Arab Emirates (UAE) said here
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan, deputy supreme commander of the UAE
Armed Forces, made the remarks during a meeting with , U.S.
Assistant Secretary of State for Middle East Affairs Edward Walker
who is visiting the country as part of his Mideast tour.
</P>
<P>
Khalifa, also Abu Dhabi crown prince, noted that the peace
requires the implementation of international resolutions concerning
the territories occupied by Israel in 1967, including Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
"We hope that further efforts would be exerted to achieve a just
and comprehensive settlement for the Palestinian people in line
with the international resolutions," Khalifa said.
</P>
<P>
The peace settlement must "include the right of the Palestinian
people to establish their own independent state with Jerusalem as
its capital, the return of Palestinian refugees and other related
resolutions issued by the United Nations during the past 50 years,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Khalifa also pointed out that the peace can only be realized by
the resumption of peace talks on all tracks, including the Syrian
track on the principle of land for peace, hoping that the failure
of the Camp David summit would not lead to frustration.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Walker briefed Khalifa on the results of the
recent Camp David summit in addition to the result of his Arab-
country tour and the talks with leaders of those countries on the
Middle East peace process.

<HEADLINE> Sevan Slams U.S., Britain for Suspending Iraq's Contracts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, August 13 (Xinhua) -- Benon Sevan, executive director
of the U.N. oil-for-food program, on Sunday criticized the United
States and British delegates at the U.N. Sanctions Committee for
delaying contracts to meet the humanitarian needs of Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Sevan made the remarks during his meeting with Iraqi Vice
President Taha Yassin Ramadan, the official Iraqi News Agency (INA)
reported.
</P>
<P>
Sevan described the repeated suspension of vital contracts Iraq
signed with foreign countries to import humanitarian goods by the
U.S. and Britain as "inhuman" and "illegal", the INA said.
</P>
<P>
Iraq does not only need food and medicine, but also a complete
national reconstruction after 10 years of crippling sanctions,
Sevan said.
</P>
<P>
For his part, the Iraqi vice president condemned the U.S. and
Britain for the continuation of their aggressive policy against
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Sevan arrived here on August 1 for a working visit.
</P>
<P>
Prior to his trip to Iraq, Sevan declared in a statement that
the U.N. oil-for-food program is no substitute for the resumption
of normal trade activities in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, "There is no doubt that the situation for many
in that country is significantly better than it was when the first
(batch of) oil was exported under the program at the end of 1996."
</P>
<P>
The three-year-old humanitarian accord is an exemption to the
crippling U.N. economic sanctions imposed on Iraq for its invasion
of Kuwait in 1990.
</P>
<P>
The program allows Iraq to sell oil under U.N. supervision to
buy food, medicine and other humanitarian goods to help offset the
impacts of the sanctions.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has repeatedly claimed the program fails to alleviate the
plight of the Iraqi people who have been hardest hit by the U.N.
sanctions.

<HEADLINE> Mubarak Sees Possibility to Postpone Declaring Palestinian Statehood </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 13 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
said on Sunday that the Palestinians could postpone declaring
statehood beyond September 13, a target date for a final peace deal
with Israel.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat has said he would declare an
independent state on September 13, with or without an agreement
with Israel.
</P>
<P>
"I hope that a solution will be reached. But I cannot tell
whether this will happen before or after September 13," Mubarak
told reporters after inaugurating a scientific research complex
near the Mediterranean port city of Alexandria.
</P>
<P>
He said the deadline could be postponed with a view to reaching
a permanent solution to avoid "a confrontation between the two
sides (the Palestinians and Israelis)."
</P>
<P>
"I am neither optimistic nor pessimistic when it comes to this
deadline," he said. "If a solution is found before September 13, I
think there will be no problem. If not, we have to be very patient,
we have to be practical."
</P>
<P>
Under pressure from the United States, some Arab states and
other countries have advised Arafat not to be hasty in declaring
statehood. Egypt is one of the very few countries which have said
will recognize the Palestinian state whenever declared.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Legislators Seek Repatriation of Afghan Refugees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, August 13 (Xinhua) -- Some 154 members of Iran's Majlis
(parliament) on Sunday urged President Mohammad Khatami's
government to repatriate Afghan refugees living in Iran to their
homeland.
</P>
<P>
The increasing number of Afghan refugees and their long-time
presence in Iran have given rise to numerous problems for Iranian
citizens, the parliament members said in an open letter to the
president.
</P>
<P>
They complained that Iran has always welcomed Afghan refugees
despite its own problems, including those caused by the 1980-1988
war against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
"The time has come for them to return to their own state," said
the letter, which was quoted by the Islamic Republic News Agency.
</P>
<P>
Last Wednesday over 1,000 Afghan refugees were repatriated from
Iran's southeastern Sistan-Baluchestan Province and the central
Isfahan Province, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Since the start on April 8 of a program organized by the United
Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), over 57,000 Afghan
refugees have returned home.
</P>
<P>
The voluntary repatriation is within the framework of an
agreement between the UNHCR and Iran, which says that 100,000
Afghan refugees will be repatriated over a six-month period.
</P>
<P>
Iranian officials say there are some 1.4 million Afghan refugees
in Iran, half of them are in Iran illegally.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Government Working on Cementing Defense: DM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, August 13 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus Defense Minister Socrates
Hasikos said Sunday the government is working silently and
methodically on strengthening the country's defense.
</P>
<P>
The government is making efforts to further cement the National
Guard in order to protect the republic, and to give the government
an opportunity to negotiate for a just solution to the Cyprus
issue, said the minister at a memorial for those killed during the
battles in northwestern Tylliria with Turkish soldiers.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus, an eastern Mediterranean state, has been divided into
the Greek and Turkish Cypriot communities since 1974 when Turkish
troops invaded and took over the northern 37 percent of the island
in the wake of a failed coup seeking union with Greece.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Cypriots in 1983 unilaterally declared a republic in
northern Cyprus which is only recognized by Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Three rounds of U.N.-sponsored proximity talks between the two
communities have been held to solve the Cyprus issue.
</P>
<P>
Hasikos said that "by securing a strong defense, we are securing
peace and consolidating the feeling of security among our people,
something necessary for the survival of the island."
</P>
<P>
Referring to the European Union (EU) Common Foreign and Security
Policy, Hasikos said that Cyprus's prospect in this context makes
the Greek Cypriots believe that the divisional plans of Ankara,
which are promoted by Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash in the
form of a confederation solution, will not pass, as they conflict
with the EU rules and regulations.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that international efforts for a solution in Cyprus
must focus on shifting Turkey's intransigent stance.
</P>
<P>
"Turkey's European prospect gives a first class opportunity to
Europe and the international community to prove that they really
honour and respect the principles and values on which they are
based," Hasikos added.

<HEADLINE> New ECO Secretary General Takes Office </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, August 13 (Xinhua) -- The new secretary general of the
Economic Cooperation Organization (ECO), Abdolrahim Gavahi, took
office here on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Gavahi, an advisor to Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi,
was chosen to replace Turkish Onder Ozar during the ECO summit in
Tehran on June 10.
</P>
<P>
At a ceremony attended by representatives of the 10 member
organization, Gavahi said there are extensive grounds for
cooperation among the ECO member countries in the fields of
transportation, trade and energy, the Islamic Republic News Agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
Linking energy transportation lines and oil and gas pipelines in
the ECO zone are among the important projects that are expected to
be implemented through cooperation among ECO members, he added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Iran's Deputy Foreign Minister for Economic Affairs
Mohammad Hussein Adeli told reporters after the ceremony that there
are broad bases for cooperation among ECO members in all fields.
</P>
<P>
He said economic development of the member countries depends on
commercial, transportation and energy cooperation among them, and
through all-out promotion of cooperation, they can win the chance
to enter the vast markets in the ECO member states.
</P>
<P>
The official urged the removal of trade barriers between Iran
and other ECO members in order to secure Iran's interests and
presence in the regional markets.
</P>
<P>
Iran lies between two important areas of hydrocarbon reserves of
the world -- the Caspian Sea and the Persian Gulf, said Adeli,
stressing the need to turn Iran into a center for distribution of
the world's oil and gas.
</P>
<P>
The Tehran-based ECO was founded by Iran, Pakistan and Turkey in
1985. The Central Asian and Caucasian republics of Azerbaijan,
Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan as
well as Afghanistan joined the group following the collapse of the
former Soviet Union in 1991.

<HEADLINE> Turkish Official Calls for Forging New Islam Image </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, August 13 (Xinhua) -- A senior Turkish official in
charge of religious affairs said on Sunday that in the changing
world, the Islamic religion must be presented by a new way based on
human rights, peace and love.
</P>
<P>
Mehmet Nuri Yilmaz, head of Turkish Religious Affairs
Directorate, made the appeal at the end of a one-day Seminar for
Provincial Muftis held in Istanbul, Anatolia News Agency reported.
Muftis are professionals who interpret codes of Islam.
</P>
<P>
He called on the Islamic world to realize unity, saying "we
can't achieve anything unless we realize the unity among
ourselves."
</P>
<P>
He also expressed belief that Turkey will succeed in forging a
new Islamic image.
</P>
<P>
Overwhelmingly Muslim Turkey sticks to secular, democratic and
nationalist principles, set up by modern Turkey's founder Mustafa
Kemal Ataturk.
</P>
<P>
A declaration issued at the conclusion of the seminar stressed
that human rights, the freedom of religion and conscience, women
rights, are among the universal values of the Islam.
</P>
<P>
Yilmaz said a course for muftis will start within this month to
train them in philosophy, diction and making speeches before
television cameras.
</P>
<P>
But he said the studies on re-interpreting the holy book of
Koran, which were discussed at the seminar, are not "reform in
religion", but re-interpretation of Islam.
</P>
<P>
"The confusing concepts in Koran can be abused politically, so
they will be reviewed and a Dictionary of Concepts will be
prepared. This is very useful," he added.
</P>
<P>
He said the radical Islamic terrorist group Hezbollah in the
country has committed kidnappings, blackmails and murders in a bid
to allegedly turn Muslim but secular Turkey into a strict Islamic-
ruled country.
</P>
<P>
"The terrorist organization depends on the principle of holy
war. These are wrong understandings coming to Turkey from other
Islamic countries. These have to be corrected," Yilmaz said.
</P>
<P>
In its anxiety to keep state and religion apart, Turkey is very
sensitive to any attempt to damage this principle.
</P>
<P>
Recently, the Turkish government submitted a decree, stipulating
removal of civil servants involved in fundamentalist or separatist
activities.

<HEADLINE> Gaddafi, Chavez Satisfied over Oil Prices </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TUNIS, August 13 (Xinhua) -- Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez
and Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi expressed their satisfaction on
Sunday over the levels of oil prices at the end of their talks in
Tripoli.
</P>
<P>
During a joint press conference, Chavez said "the current prices
are fair enough to raise the living standards of our nations."
</P>
<P>
The Venezuelan president called on the members of the
Organization of Oil Exporting countries (OPEC) to "be united in
facing the pressures aimed at reducing the oil prices which are
currently settled at around 30 U.S.dollars a barrel."
</P>
<P>
"OPEC has the ability to confront these pressures, and
protecting our interests is very important for us all," he said
</P>
<P>
Chavez accused the more oil consuming western countries of "
trying to impose the prices suitable for them. These countries earn
more than 100 U.S. dollars per barrel."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Libyan leader stressed "the great potentials and
capabilities of OPEC members can easily twist the arms of others,"
apparently in a reference to the more oil consuming western
countries.
</P>
<P>
Gaddafi urged countries of Africa, Latin America and Asia to
form a united front in facing the increasing pressures and
challenges, expressing his full support for the "Venezuelan
regime."
</P>
<P>
He affirmed that "Latin America's countries are working for
building a Latin entity while those of Africa are trying to build
their own entity."
</P>
<P>
Chavez arrived in Libya Sunday morning from Indonesia where he
held talks with Gaddafi in Aziziyaa town, which was bombed by the
U.S. fighters in 1986.
</P>
<P>
Chavez is touring OPEC members to invite their leaders to attend
the oil cartel summit meeting due to be held next September in the
Venezuelan capital of Caracas to mark the 40th anniversary of OPEC.
</P>
<P>
OPEC, established in Baghdad in 1960, held its previous summit
in Algiers in 1975.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. strongly criticized Chavez, who will also visit Nigeria
and Algeria, since he is the first president of a foreign country
to visit Iraq after the Gulf war in 1991.

raided several guest houses and hotels in some parts of the city
against possible hiding of any militant from Kashmir, the PTI

its capital Srinagar, which killed 12 people, and two improvised

security force soldiers were killed and over 40 others injured.
</P>
<P>
In the southern part of the country, police and paramilitary

militants might attempt to strike important cities including
Hyderabad and Bangalore, the PTI added.

<HEADLINE> Two Killed in Bomb Blast in S. Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 13 (Xinhua) -- Two people, including a 13-year-
old boy, were killed and seven others injured in a bomb explosion
Sunday morning in a hamburger restaurant in the southern
Philippines province of North Cotabato, a local TV station
reported.
</P>
<P>
The ABS-CBN news channel said earlier in a report one person
died and 10 others were wounded in the bombing of the restaurant
in Carmen, North Cotabato.
</P>
<P>
No individual or group has claimed responsibility for the bomb
blast, but the government blamed it on the secessionist Moro
Islamic Liberation Front (MILF).
</P>
<P>
Military officials said an 81mm homemade bomb was used in the
bombing.
</P>
<P>
Carmen witnessed a massacre of 16 people, mostly children,
including a two-year-old child, by suspected MILF rebels early
this month.
</P>
<P>
On August 4, a group of 100 heavily armed MILF men allegedly
stopped three passing vehicles carrying 26 passengers at a place
in Carmen, and shot them at close range after divesting them of
their money, jewelry, and other personal belongings.
</P>
<P>
The government blamed MILF, which has been fighting for an
independent Islamic state in the south, for a series of terrorist
acts in the country after the military captured its headquarters,
Camp Abubakar, early last month.
</P>
<P>
The government last Wednesday offered rewards totaling 9
million pesos (about 200,000 U.S. dollars) for the capture of
three top leaders of the secessionist group.

<HEADLINE> Reuters To Cut Up To 1,700 Jobs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 13 (Xinhua) -- Reuters, the news and information
provider, is set to cut up to 1,700 jobs as part of a two-year
restructuring of the group, the Independent newspaper reported
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The company, which is valued at 18 billion pounds (12 billion U.
S. dollars) on the stock market, unveiled plans in February to
transform itself into an integrated Internet-enabled business.
</P>
<P>
But the paper said the transformation will lead to the group
axing around 10 percent of its workforce and that the job losses
would be spread across all divisions of the company.
</P>
<P>
It quoted Paul Richards, media analyst at West LB Panmure, as
saying, "They have set themselves a very aggressive target. It is
clear that there will be an element of staff cuts as part of this.
"
</P>
<P>
However, he said that it was unlikely that Reuters would "cut
swaths of staff in one go." Instead Reuters would handle the loss
in a "gentle way," redeploying staff where it could.

world championship lead from Michael Schumacher for the first time
this season after winning the Hungarian Grand Prix Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The two-times world champion Hakkinen emerged as hot contender
when another perfect start propelled him from third place on the
grid past pole position holder Schumacher and McLaren-Mercedes
teammate David Coulthard.
</P>
<P>
The Finn never looked back again to win his third race of the
season, 17th overall and second in a row in Hungary on a hot

<P>
Ferrari driver Schumacher placed second after failing to finish
in the last three races, but had to relinquish the world
championship lead for the first time in the season.
</P>
<P>
Hakkinen has 64 points from 12 of 17 races, Schumacher 62 and
the third-place finisher Coulthard 58 points. The next race is the
Belgian Grand Prix on August 27 at Spa-Francorchamps.

<HEADLINE> Phelps Becomes Youngest Swimmer in Olympics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 13 (Xinhua) -- Michael Phelps celebrated his
15th birthday two months ago, and nowsdays became the youngest
male swimmer to make the U.S. Olympic team in 68 years.
</P>
<P>
Phelps, who concluded his freshman year at Towson High in North
Baltimore,
finished second Saturday evening in the 200m butterfly at the U.S.
Olympic trials to world record holder and 1996 Olympic silver
medalist Tom Malchow.
</P>
<P>
When he qualified for the Olympics in 1:57.48, Phelps looked
stunned as he stared at the scoreboard, saying "At first I couldn'
t really believe it. I thought I saw it, then I had to take my
goggles off to really see it. It's pretty amazing."
</P>
<P>
Phelps began swimming at age 7 by following his two older
sisters to the pool, he attended the 1996 Olympic trials only as a
wide-eyed spectator. He was 10 years old then, cheering on his
sister Whitney who then ranked first in the 200m butterfly
entering those trials, but finished sixth overall.
</P>
<P>
Phelps continued playing a variety of sports until last year
when he decided to begin swimming double sessions for the first
time. He hung an autographed poster of a swimming great in his
room and began dreaming of the Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
At the 1999 U.S. championships, he first broke two minutes in
the 200m butterfly, and clocked 1:59.02 at this year's U.S.
nationals in March, the second-fastest in the United States this
year, only behind Malchow.
</P>
<P>
After the finals, Phelps became the youngest American male
Olympic swimmer since 1932 when Ralph Flanagan made the team as a
13-year-old.

<HEADLINE> Singapore's Natioanl Football Academy Launched </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, August 13 (Xinhua) -- Singapore's National Football
Academy (NFA) was officially launched Sunday by Singapore Deputy
Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, as part of the country's effort to
achieve Goal 2010 with which the Football Association of Singapore
(FAS) has set itself the ambitious goal of qualifying for the
final rounds of the World Cup in 2010.
</P>
<P>
In his speech at the launch, the deputy prime minister said
that given Singapore's small population and limited talent pool,
gathering and nurturing talent will be a key challenge.
</P>
<P>
He also said that there will be a need to tap on foreign talent
to supplement the local talent for football, just as Singapore
needs foreign talent to strengthen its economic competitiveness
and build world-class companies.
</P>
<P>
He affirmed that the first priority should be given to the
development of the local talent.
</P>
<P>
The establishment of the NFA will support FAS' efforts to
promote general interest in football and aims to take football in
Singapore one level higher by providing the framework to identify
and nurture those who show promise and interest in the game.
</P>
<P>
In collaboration with the Ministry of Education, NFA has set up
16 regional feeder training centers, called Centers of Excellence
(COEs). Through these centers, children aged between 12 and 18
with potential will be identified and given more regular training
by full-time coaches throughout the year and the best players will
go for further grooming and more intensive training by FAS expert
staff coaches and sports scientists from Singapore Sports Council.
</P>
<P>
Outstanding players from the academy will be given opportunity
to represent Singapore in regional and international age-group
competitions and such competitions, both local and overseas, will
provide the necessary training and exposure for them to develop
into top-rate professional players in the years ahead.
</P>
<P>
Lee also said that the academy is not only about football
training and does not want its trainees to focus soly on football,
neglecting their studies in school or their future careers after
they leave competitive foogball.
</P>
<P>
It will provide support schemes for its trainees, includihg
tuition, classes, scholarships for further studies and career
guidance, he said.

<HEADLINE> Upper Reaches of Yangtze Maintains Low Water Level </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHONGQING, August 13 (Xinhua) -- The water level in the upper
reaches of the Yangtze River, China's longest, has remained
unusually low during this year's flood season, which started in
July.
</P>
<P>
The water level in the section of the Yangtze in Chongqing, a
municipality in southwest China, has been especially low than in
previous years as of this week. However, experts warned that water
crests may come in autumn.
</P>
<P>
Sources from the Chongqing Navigation Route Bureau said that
the water level in Chongqing dropped by more than 20 meters from
July 20 to August 4, with the lowest water level standing at 166.
13 meters.
</P>
<P>
The sources said that this is the lowest water level in the
section since the 1960s, which comes only second to the 163.94
meter level in 1987. But its duration at that level is making a
record.
</P>
<P>
The continuing low level of water has caused trouble for ships
traveling on the river. On August 3, a 100-ton light barge was
stranded because of shallow water.
</P>
<P>
Experts attribute the continuous low water level to less
rainfall during the flood season, and the fact that low
temperatures on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau reduced the source
amount of water for the Yangtze since less snow melted.
</P>
<P>
The low water level in Chongqing is expected to continue for
some time, predicted experts.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Investigators Urged to Interview Jordanian Pilot Over EgyptAir Crash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 13 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Pilots Association chief
Walid Murad demanded on Sunday that U.S. investigators probing last
October's EgyptAir Flight 990 crash interview pilots who said they
saw a shooting fireball near the crash site.
</P>
<P>
The testimony of the German and Jordanian pilots must be heard
regarding their sighting of missile-like bodies in the same place
the Egyptian plane went down, Murad told reporters.
</P>
<P>
According to documents released on Friday by the U.S. National
Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), a Royal Jordanian co-pilot saw
a fireball in the sky on the same day after leaving the same
airport as the doomed EgyptAir flight.
</P>
<P>
The pilot of Flight RJ262 from New York's John F. Kennedy
airport on October 31 last year reported that his co-pilot made the
sighting shortly after the takeoff while he had his head down.
</P>
<P>
The co-pilot said that he saw a fireball like a shooting star
passing ahead at the Jordanian plane very close from right to left
going down, the pilot wrote, as cited by Egyptian investigators in
the NTSB documents.
</P>
<P>
The captain, who submitted his report to the airlines two weeks
after the EgyptAir crash, said his plane had the same flight path
clearance as the EgyptAir plane.
</P>
<P>
The head of the Egyptian Pilots Association asked for the pilots
to be interviewed again and accused U.S. investigators of
deliberately ignoring problems that hold the key to explaining the
crash.
</P>
<P>
Murad joined Egyptian investigators in demanding the release of
classified data regarding three high-speed radar images passing
near EgyptAir Flight 990 just before it began its dive into the
Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
"The absence of this information removes the credibility of the
American investigators," he said.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian Civil Aviation Authority chief Abdel Fattah Kato has
complained the withholding by the U.S. side the radar information
for reasons of classified military data.
</P>
<P>
It was difficult to understand why data concerning the
characteristics of radar used in connection with the U.S. civil
aviation was classified and why it was unavailable for the
analysis of apparent targets that were in the vicinity of the
plane, he wrote in a letter to the U.S. Federal Aviation
Administration in June. The letter was included in the
investigation documents.
</P>
<P>
All 217 people on board died in the EgyptAir flight crash.

<HEADLINE> UAE Calls on U.S. to Be Fair and Just Broker </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, August 13 (Xinhua) -- Deputy Prime Minister of the
United Arab Emirates (UAE) Sheikh Sultan Bin Zayed al-Nahyan Sunday
called on the U.S. to be fair and just in the course of discharging
its duties as a broker of the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
During a meeting with visiting Edward Walker, the U.S. assistant
secretary of state for Middle East Affairs, Sultan reiterated his
country's stance of supporting the Palestinians in their talks with
Israel, adding UAE strongly backs the just Palestinian demand which
is in line with the U.N. resolutions.
</P>
<P>
Jerusalem was not only sacred to the Palestinians alone but also
to all Muslims and Christians as well, said the minister, adding
the special status of the holy city makes it illogic for any
faction to try to take full control of the city at the expense of
the other.
</P>
<P>
He said there must be an international solution for the issue of
that holy city -- a solution which will take into consideration the
special status of the city and, at the same time, ensure the rights
of the Palestinians to establish their own independent state.
</P>
<P>
Any solution to the issue of Jerusalem outside such a framework
will never be approved by the Arabs and the international
community, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
He also expressed the hope that the peace process will achieve
its objectives, and that all the parties involved will play their
expected roles and will show some flexibility toward some sensitive
issues, including the rights of the Palestinians to establish their
independent state and the return of Palestinian refugees to their
homeland.
</P>
<P>
For his side, Walker, who is on a regional tour to review with
Arab leaders last month's Camp David summit and the U.S. points of
view on the latest developments of the peace process, said
Washington is committed to exerting efforts to ensure that the
peace negotiations achieve its goals so as to bring lasting and
comprehensive peace to the region.
</P>
<P>
He also expressed his country's appreciations for the role that
the UAE can play to contribute to the success of the peace process
due to the respect the UAE command in the region and on the
international arena.

<HEADLINE> Three Gorges Residents Set out for Resettlement in Shanghai </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHONGQING, August 13 (Xinhua) -- More than 600 residents from
the Three Gorges Project construction site in southwest China
started their journey to east China's Shanghai Municipality today.
</P>
<P>
They came from Yunyang County of Chongqing Municipality, and
are the first group of people who are leaving the Three Gorges
Project construction area to resettle in the Chongming Island of
Shanghai and 10 other provinces in the country.
</P>
<P>
According to a related plan, a total of 70,000 rural people
will leave five counties in Chongqing to resettle in Shanghai and
10 provinces including Zhejiang and Guangdong in three years.
</P>
<P>
This year these places will each accept over 600 people from
the Three Gorges Project construction area, and all the people are
expected to reach their new homes before September 1, so that they
can start farming in time and their children can go to school when
the autumn semester starts.
</P>
<P>
The 639 people from Chongqing's Yunyang County will build their
homes on the Chongming Island, Shanghai. Today, Chongqing
Municipality and Yunyang County sent out officials and a medical
team to accompany them.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai has made preparations to welcome the new residents,
according to the Chongqing Resettlement Bureau. Shanghai has built
spacious and well-designed houses for the new comers, and plans to
grant 0.067 hectare of farmland to each of them. Shanghai will
also reduce or exempt the new residents' agriculture taxes and
have their children's tuition reduced or exempted.
</P>
<P>
From 1993 to the end of 1999, 230,000 people have been
relocated to higher elevations in the Three Gorges Project area.
</P>
<P>
China will inject about 40 billion yuan into resettling 1.13
million people affected by the Three Gorges Project which will dam
the Yangtze River in an area bordering Hubei Province, central
China, and Chongqing Municipality.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1999, 17.68 billion yuan had been used for the
resettlement project.

<HEADLINE> Iran Discovers Large Gas Field </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, August 13 (Xinhua) -- Iran announced on Sunday it has
discovered a large gas field with a on-spot gas reserve of up to 6.
7 trillion cubic feet (about 187.6 billion cubic meters).
</P>
<P>
Seyed Mahmoud Mohaddes, director for exploration affairs of the
National Iranian Oil Company (NIOC), said the gas field, named as "
Homa", was discovered in the southern province of Fars.
</P>
<P>
He said the economic value of gas and gaseous liquids in the gas
field was estimated at about 4.7 billion U.S. dollars while the
cost of drilling operation and analyzing geological layers at about
18 billion rials (about 2.25 million dollars at the market rate).
</P>
<P>
Mohaddes told the Islamic Republic News Agency that the gas
field, located 45 kilometers north of the Persian Gulf coast, also
has a reserve of 82 million barrels of on-spot gaseous liquids.
</P>
<P>
Putting the exploitation index of the field at 70 percent, the
official said the field is expected to yield 4.74 trillion cubic
feet (about 132.72 billion cubic meters) of gas and 58 million
barrels of gaseous liquids.
</P>
<P>
The Homa gas field, located at an altitude of 1,350 meters, is
40 kilometers long and 5.5 kilometers wide, he said, adding the
depth of its gaseous layer is about 650 meters.
</P>
<P>
Iranian Oil Minister Bijan Namdar Zanganeh announced in April
that the largest sweet gas field in the world was discovered in
southern Iran with an estimated reserve of more than 445 billion
cubic meters of gas and over 240 million barrels of liquid gas.
</P>
<P>
After Russia, Iran ranks the second in the world with a proven
gas reserve of 21 trillion cubic meters. Iran also has a share in
the world's large gas field in the Gulf which has an estimated
reserve of over 12 trillion cubic meters.

<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, August 13 (Xinhua) -- Cuba won the second leg of
the 2000 World Grand Prix Women's Volleyball Championship with an
unbeaten record here on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Cuba, the two-time Olympics champion, won all the matches,
beating South Korea 3-1, the United States 3-0 and China 3-0.
</P>
<P>
Cuba picked up the first prize of 152,000 ringgit (40,000 U.S.
dollars) followed by China who collected 95,000 ringgit (25,000 U.
S. dollars) for the second spot on count-back.
</P>
<P>
South Korea were in third position while the United States
finished fourth.
</P>
<P>
The World Grand Prix circuit comprising the world's top eight
teams was started in 1993 where Cuba emerged as the inaugural
champions.
</P>
<P>
The circuit is held over four legs and this year's teams are
Cuba, South Korea, China, the United States, Brazil, Russia, Italy

<HEADLINE> Brazil Wins FIVB Beach Volleyball-Ostende Title </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OSTENDE, Belgium, August 13 (Xinhua) -- Jose Geraldo Loiola
served four aces, blocked twice and spiked twice to pace team
Brazil to winning Sunday's FIVB Beach Volleyball World Tour-
Ostende tourney.
</P>
<P>
Yet the winning point came from Loiola's teammate Emanuel Rego
who spiked to score the winner after the Brazilian duo dived twice
to save two smash shots from their American opponents.
</P>
<P>
Loiola served three aces to pace the South Americans to a 6-0
lead in the grand finale of the Ostende tournament that drew 39
teams from 20 countries.
</P>
<P>
John "Sinjin" Smith, or better known as the King of the Beach
for his long career in the sport, and Carl John Henkel plowed back
into play with three points taken in succession via blocking and a
mistake on the other side of the net.
</P>
<P>
Smith, 43 and the oldest player here, gave all he had left
after winning the semifinals earlier in the day beating Norwegians
Jorre Andre Kjemperud and Vegard Hoidalen 15-5.
</P>
<P>
Yet losing the flip of coins for choosing the starting side,
the Americans had to play with the wind on their backs, usually a
bad start for the wind often holds sway over the ball while
serving and spiking.
</P>
<P>
Fatigue and loss of concentration showed on the North American
side when mis-judgement of the serve balls from across the net led
to the four aces that caught the Americans flat-footed.
</P>
<P>
Loiola and Emanuel earlier beat another American duet of Dain
Blanton and Eric Fonoimoana 15-5 in the semi-finals to reach the
gold-medal match.
</P>
<P>
Loiola said after the match that it was great to win the
tournament at Ostende and the win would boost the Brazilians'
chance at the forthcoming Olympic Games. "It was great to win
here and our chance at Sydney will be great," he said.
</P>
<P>
Loiola-Emanuel, who led the 24 men's qualifying teams for the
Olympics with 3,240 points from the previous 12 World Tour
tournaments, added another 170 points to their tally on Sunday
while Smith-Henkel got 153 points by finishing runners-up.
</P>
<P>
The FIVB Beach Volleyball World Tour-Ostende is the 13th stop
of this year's 14-stop tour that ends in November in Brazil. It
is, however, the last world-level competition prior to the Sydney
Olympics so most teams that have qualified for Sydney were here to
test their own as well as their opponents' form and flair.

<HEADLINE> Impeachment Threat Against Israeli President Withdrawn </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 13 (Xinhua) -- An impeachment threat levelled
against Israel's newly-elected President Moshe Katsav has been
dropped after the head of state clarified his controversial remarks
on secular political leaders.
</P>
<P>
Lawmaker Yosef Paritzky of the Shinui Party, who made the
impeachment threat, said Sunday that he accepted the president's
clarification and will not let the impeachment proceedings go
ahead, according to Shinui officials.
</P>
<P>
Katsav, a pious orthodox Jew, was earlier quoted by a orthodox
newspaper as saying that the Jewish state would not have come into
existence if all the Jews were "like (Meretz party leader) Yossi
Sarid and (Shinui party leader) Tommy Lapid."
</P>
<P>
The comment infuriated Israel's secular circles as Sarid and
Lapid are reputed secular figures and Paritzky threatened an
impeachment motion unless the president apologizes.
</P>
<P>
Later, Katsav told Israel Radio that his words were taken out of
context and what he had said was only that the Jewish people would
have not remained unless they had kept the Jewish tradition.
</P>
<P>
Sarid, who is poised to rejoin Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak's coalition as education minister, also reportedly accepted
Katsav's clarification.
</P>
<P>
Katsav defeated Barak's presidential candidate, Regional
Cooperation Minister Shimon Peres, in a dramatic presidential
voting in Israel's Knesset (parliament) on July 31.
</P>
<P>
Most analysts attributed Katsav's success to his pledges that if
elected, he would be president for all Israelis, secular and
religious, and he would not meddle in political issues.
</P>
<P>
However, since his swearing-in on August 1, the president has
made a string of controversial comments and moves. He spent his
first days in office visiting Rabbi Ovadia Yosef and Rabbi Yitzhak
Kadourie, two prominent religious leaders, showing his favoritism
to orthodox Jews.
</P>
<P>
When Rabbi Yosef was caught into a great political disturbance
because of his last weekend's sermon, in which he said 6 million
Jews murdered by Nazis during the World War Two were "reincarnated
sinners," and the Palestinians are "snakes," President Katsav
refrained from blasting him.
</P>
<P>
Last Wednesday, Katsav said that he cannot imagine a situation
in which Jews will not live in Hebron, a West Bank city where 450
Jewish settlers live among 130,000 Palestinians.

<HEADLINE> Rafsanjani Urges to Preserve National Unity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, August 13 (Xinhua) -- Former Iranian President Hashemi
Rafsanjani has urged officials, groups and people from all strata
to preserve national unity and security amid growing factional
struggles between the reformist and the conservative camps.
</P>
<P>
If national unity is harmed, no matter how far the country is
successful in its construction trend, it would still be vulnerable,
the Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA) on Sunday quoted him as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a gathering of Iranian diplomats abroad on Saturday
afternoon, he underlined that groups and individuals should not
weaken each other nor should they undermine honors of one another.
</P>
<P>
Since the landslide victory of the reformist allies of President
Mohammad Khatami in the February parliamentary elections, tensions
have been growing between the reformists and the conservatives who
still control the country's major state organs such as the
judiciary and armed forces.
</P>
<P>
The conservative-dominated judiciary launched a wholesale
crackdown on the reformist camp by closing down some 20 reformist
newspapers and journals and arresting a dozen of reformist writers
and activists.
</P>
<P>
IRNA said that journalist Mohammad Qouchani was detained on
Sunday after being summoned to court while satirist Seyyed Ebrahim
Nabavi was arrested on Saturday on various charges.
</P>
<P>
"Undermining national unity is one of the prime objectives of
the enemies and global arrogance against Iran," warned Rafsanjani,
current chairman of the State Expediency Council, which functions
as an arbitrator between the reformist parliament and conservative
Guardians Council.
</P>
<P>
He said that since the 1979 Islamic revolution, the "enemies"
have not lost any opportunity to deal a blow on the revolution and
they would not abandon their hostile policies against Iran.
</P>
<P>
He called on all officials and forces in the society to closely
cooperate with the government to remove impediments on the way of
development to address their economic demands.
</P>
<P>
Rafsanjani strongly advocated economic reforms to set up market
economy in the country during his two-term presidency (1989-1997),
but shifted to the conservative camp against political reforms
following the February parliamentary elections, in which he
suffered a face-losing defeat.
</P>
<P>
On foreign policies of the country, the Iranian former president
also underlined the need for consolidation of relations between
Iran and all its neighbors as well as major Islamic countries.
</P>
<P>
"We are very serious on the issue of Palestine," he said, "in
acute international issues such as the issue of Palestine, we do
not forget our principles and ideals and we believe the issues
should be treated prudently."
</P>
<P>
About Iran's relations with the United States, he said that the
Americans are not compatible with the present situation in Iran. As
long as the situation remains unchanged in the world and in the
region, they would not accept Israel's foe (Iran) gains a bigger
share in regional and international exchanges, he said.
</P>
<P>
The four-day gathering of Iranian diplomats abroad opened here
Saturday morning with participation of over 110 ambassadors, charge
d'affaires and heads of interest sections.

<HEADLINE> Hyundai Issues Corporate Restructuring Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, August 13 (Xinhua) -- South Korea's largest business
conglomerate Hyundai Group issued its long-delayed restructuring
plan on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Under the plan, Hyundai Group founder Chung Ju-yung will sell
his stake in Hyundai Motor to clear the way for its spinoff after
a protracted standoff with the South Korean government and the
group's creditors.
</P>
<P>
Ailing Chung's 6.1 percent stake in Hyundai Motor accounts for
127 million shares, or 220 billion won (about 200 million U.S.
dollars) based on the current share price.
</P>
<P>
His 6.1 percent stake has been a stumbling block for Hyundai
Motor's spinoff, which was originally scheduled for completion by
the end of June, and caused a drawn-out tug of war with the
government, resulting in the loss of Hyundai's credibility.
</P>
<P>
"Two thirds of the senior Chung's 6.1 percent stake in Hyundai
Motor will be sold through the creditors before year-end, and the
proceeds will be used to ease the credit crunch facing the cash-
strapped Hyundai Engineering &AMP; Construction," said Kim Jae-soo
from Hyundai's corporate restructuring committee at a press
conference Sunday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Hyundai Construction will mobilize 1.5 trillion won
(some 1.3 billion U.S. dollars) in additional liquidity through
asset sales by the end of the year and Hyundai Construction will
issue exchangeable bonds on a 6.9 percent stake in Hyundai Heavy
Industries, and a 23.9 percent stake in Hyundai Merchant Marine to
raise 223 billion won (about 200 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
In addition, Hyundai Group will sell its real estate at home
and abroad for 94 billion won (about 85.5 million U.S. dollars),
and retrieve foreign and domestic credits amounting to 215 billion
won (about 196 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
However, Kim said Hyundai has dropped a plan included in its
previous self-rescue plan, such as the issuance of asset-backed
securities on a large farm in Sosan, South Korea, due to lack of
immediate feasibility.
</P>
<P>
He also said that Hyundai will implement its promise made in
late May to have founder Chung and his two sons--former group
chairman Chung Mong-hun and Hyundai Motor chairman Chung Mong-koo--
retire from management.
</P>
<P>
The resignation of some senior executives, who creditors say
are responsible for Hyundai's current crisis, will be finalized
through pertinent procedures, such as board of directors' meetings
and shareholders' meetings.
</P>
<P>
Presidents of 14 creditor banks for Hyundai Group are expected
to meet Monday to discuss the contents of Hyundai's self-rescue
plan and coordinate their collective stance.
</P>
<P>
Just after the plan was issued, the South Korean government
expressed satisfaction over it.
</P>
<P>
Hyundai considered all realistic aspects that can meet the
demand of the creditor banks and market expectations in coming up
with the measures to improve the business, said a spokesperson for
the Financial Supervisory Commission.
</P>
<P>
The commission expects creditors and Hyundai to fully cooperate
to execute the plan and it will keep check on the progress, added
the spokesman.

<HEADLINE> Gene-Chip Technology on Mass Industrialization </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, August 13 (Xinhua)-- China now is able to
industrialize the production of gene-chip at an annual output of
two million pieces, announced the inventor of Associated Gene
Technology Co. recently.
</P>
<P>
It is reportedly the first mass production drive in the world
to put the technology on practical clinic operation.
</P>
<P>
Gene-chip technology is an approach to design, based on DNA
sequence information, and produce miniature gene-chip probe arrays,
using spatially patterned combinatorial chemical synthesis,
experts said. It is now feasible to make examination on several
diseases or biological specimen at a time.
</P>
<P>
The Associated Gene Technology Co. has made a greater advance
to integrate 175,000 items of gene probe into a set of five tiny
biochips, a high density of nearly 6,000 probes per sq. cm..
</P>
<P>
Now it only takes one test to accurately identify the
expression events of about 40,000 types of genes in human body,
while the examination had to be made at least 40,000 times before.
</P>
<P>
Similar gene-chip costs over 15 U.S. dollars in the
international market while China-made chip is only about two U.S.
dollars each.
</P>
<P>
The gene-chip technology has applied seven patents in China,
and the company has developed ten series of productions so far.

<HEADLINE> Coca-Cola Aims to Double its China Business in 5 Years (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 13 (Xinhua) -- The Coca-Cola Company will
strive to double its business in China in the next five years,
said Jack Stahl, president and chief operating officer of the U.S.
giant soft drink maker on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Stahl began his six-day visit to China on Thursday, the first
since he became president of Coca-Cola. He told the Chinese press
that he thoroughly reviewed the company's business in China with
the local company leaders and its bottling partners.
</P>
<P>
"We would hope and target we can double our business over the
next five years in China," he said. "I have heard for many years
about the huge opportunities here. I think the thing that strikes
me most (in the visit) is how real and exciting that opportunity
is."
</P>
<P>
Coca-Cola re-entered the Chinese market in 1979. Over the past
20 years, it has established, with its Chinese partners, 23
bottling plants and 27 production locations. Total investment adds
up to more than 1.1 billion U.S. dollars, and local employment
reached 15,000.
</P>
<P>
The 20 year development of the company in China "is very
exciting," he said, adding that its business in China "in many
ways is just beginning." He stressed his company will take a new
approach to achieve the goal of development in the new century. (

<TEXT>
<P>
"The idea is to become a local marketing company, taking
advantage of the production capacity already in place, and at the
same time seeking new locations for production to build the
business in the western part of the country," he said.
</P>
<P>
After the Coca-Cola crisis in Europe last year, Stahl, who
assumed his current office last February, said that his company
has changed its strategy to "think local, act local." That means
they have to get closer to local communities and people.
</P>
<P>
Stahl said he now spends about 70 to 80 percent of his time
traveling around the world, helping to develop relationships, to
reinforce the direction of his company, and to "work with our
bottlers and customers and our local people to grow the business
aggressively."
</P>
<P>
The company is now moving its division office from Hong Kong to
Shanghai, as part of its new strategy for the development of its
business in China. It has also developed new soft drinks like ice
tea that some local consumers favor.
</P>
<P>
The president said Coca-Cola pays close attention to China's
entry into the World Trade Organization and the country's strategy
to develop its vast western areas. He said his company will
continue to "invest aggressively" in China.
</P>
<P>
He said China could someday become Coca-Cola's largest market
in the world.
</P>
<P>
"It is difficult to predict (when that day will come), but
everything I see here for a very short period of time tells me
that I want to come back a lot to help that to happen, and help it
happen quickly," he said. "Just given the optimism and excitement
within the country, I think it's a very real possibility."

<HEADLINE> Iran Says It Holds No More Iraqi POWs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, August 13 (Xinhua) -- Head of Iran's commission for
prisoners of war (POWs) Brigadier General Abdollah Najafi said here
Sunday that Iran holds no more Iraqi POWs.
</P>
<P>
The official dismissed as "mere lies" Iraqi claims that Tehran
is still holding 29,000 Iraqi soldiers.
</P>
<P>
His statement came two days after Iran unilaterally released 728
Iraqi POWs. Iran said that it was the last group of Iraqi captives
to be freed since the end of the eight-year war between the two
neighbors in 1988.
</P>
<P>
Iran has in the past years unilaterally released Iraqi POWs to
show its goodwill and now it is Iraq's turn to do the same, Najafi
was quoted by the Islamic Republic News Agency as saying.
</P>
<P>
Since the start of the current Iranian year on March 20, Iran
has released 4,117 Iraqi POWs, bringing the total number of freed
Iraqi soldiers since 1988 to 59,830, the official said.
</P>
<P>
He added that over 9,000 Iraqi POWs are not willing to return to
Iraq and have sought refuge in Iran, including 7,307 who have
expressed their wishes to the International Committee of the Red
Cross (ICRC).
</P>
<P>
The official confirmed that Iraq has freed 39,417 Iranian POWs
since the end of the war, but insisting that at least 3,000 Iranian
soldiers are still being held in Iraqi prisons.
</P>
<P>
He urged the ICRC, which supervises the POW releases of both
countries, and other international organizations, to exert pressure
on Iraq to release remaining Iranian POWs.
</P>
<P>
He accused Iraq of being not in favor of a full resolution of
the POW issue and still impeding the process by launching negative
propaganda against Iran.
</P>
<P>
ICRC representatives are to meet in Geneva with an Iraqi
delegation to decide the fate of the remaining Iranian POWs held in
Iraq, he added.
</P>
<P>
The POWs issue has been a key stumbling block to normalization
of ties between the two countries, whose eight-year war cost nearly
1 million lives on both sides.

<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, August 13 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's demand for petroleum
products in the first half of this year rose by 2.3 percent, while
supply of the products increased by 1.3 percent, according to a
report of the Petroleum Authority of Thailand (PTT) available here
on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Petroleum products' domestic demand in the January-to-June

the same period of last year, said the report.
</P>
<P>
Supply of petroleum products in the same period accounted for 1.
133 million barrels a day, an increase of 1.3 percent from the
same period of 1999, it added.
</P>
<P>
Most of the petroleum supply, or 701, 500 barrels a day, came

of last year, which included refined oil (36,700 barrels a day),
crude oil (653,900 barrels a day), and natural gas from Myanmar (
10,900 barrels a day), it stated.
</P>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 13 (Xinhua) -- One person was killed and 10
others were injured in a bomb explosion Sunday morning in a
hamburger restaurant in the southern Philippines province of North
Cotabato, a TV station reported.
</P>
<P>
Military officials said suspects used an 81mm homemade bomb in
the bombing of the restaurant in Carmen, North Cotabato, the ABS-
CBN news channel said.
</P>
<P>
No individual or group claimed responsibility for the explosion.
</P>
<P>
Carmen witnessed a massacre of 16 people, mostly children, by
suspected Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) rebels early this
month.
</P>
<P>
On August 4, a group of 100 heavily armed MILF men allegedly
stopped three passing vehicles carrying 26 passengers at a place
in Carmen, and shot them at close range after divesting them of
their money, jewelry, and other personal belongings.
</P>
<P>
The government blames MILF, which has been fighting for an
independent Islamic state in the south, for a series of terrorist
acts in the country after the military captured its headquarters,
Camp Abubakar, early last month.
</P>
<P>
The government last Wednesday offered rewards totaling 9
million pesos (about 200,000 U.S. dollars) for the capture of
three top leaders of the secessionist group.

<TEXT>
<P>
"While National Long Distance Operators (NLDO) will have a
right to carry inter-circle long distance traffic, they can carry
intra-circle long distance traffic in a mutual agreement with
fixed line service providers in the circle," Indian Communications
Minister Ram Vilas Paswant was quoted as saying by the Press Trust
of India (PTI).
</P>
<P>
Besides an entry fee, an operator would have to give a bank
guarantee of 4 billion rupees (88.8 million dollars) which would
be refunded in a phased manner on fulfillment of network
obligations including certain remote and uneconomic areas, Paswant
added.
</P>
<P>
In the first phase of roll-out, the operator would have to
cover 15 percent of the prescribed area in two years, failing
which the bank guarantee worth 1 billion rupees would be forfeited,
he noted.
</P>
<P>
For the long distance sector, a revenue share of 15 percent has
been fixed, which includes a portion of 5 percent to meet
Universal Service Obligations, he added.
</P>
<P>
An Indian registered company with a maximum foreign equity of
49 percent would be eligible to get the license for NLDO, the
minister said, adding that the Department of Telecommunication
would be the licensor.
</P>
<P>
Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee announced on July 15
that the country's domestic long distance call sector would be
opened up for competition by August 15 without any ceiling on the
number of players.

<HEADLINE> Brazil, U.S. Enter Beach Volleyball-Ostende Finals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OSTENDE, Belgium, August 13 (Xinhua) -- Reigning world titlists
Emanuel Rego and Jose Geraldo Loiola from Brazil on Sunday joined
Americans Carl John Henkel and John Sinjin Smith in the finals of
the FIVB Beach Volleyball World Tour-Ostende.
</P>
<P>
The Brazilian duo, who led the 24 teams that have qualified on
accumulated points for the forthcoming men's beach vollyeball
tournament of the Sydney Olympics, beat Dain Blanton and Eric
Fonoimoana of the United States 15-5.
</P>
<P>
The South Americans proved just too a bit much for their North
American opponents when they quickly built up a lead of 9-1. The
only point they gave in the opening play was a block-in.
</P>
<P>
At 43 and known as the King of the Beach, John "Sinjin" Smith
teamed up with Carl John Henkel to defeat Jorre Andre Kjemperud
and Vegard Hoidalen from Norway in the day's other semi-finals.
</P>
<P>
The Americans, though starting the match with the wind blowing
on their backs that is usually bad for a start, never looked back
after grabbing six unanswered points.
</P>
<P>
Norway is a country that is famous for its fjords and not for
sand beaches but has still produced a pair that fared so well in
the Ostende tourney as squeezing into the top fours. Yet the
Norwegians had to settle down with going 15-5 down to the American
duo that included the beach king.
</P>
<P>
Smith has been playing beach volleyball for more than two
decades and is so well-known to other beach volleyballers and fans
of the sport that they even have shortened his full given name of
Saint John for a nickname of Sinjin.
</P>
<P>
The losers will meet later in the day to decide the third place
of the 39-team tournament at Ostende while the winners of the semi-
finals play in the grand finale.
</P>
<P>
The FIVB Beach Volleyball World Tour-Ostende is the 13th stop
of this year's 14-stop tour that ends in November in Brazil. It
is, however, the last world-level competition prior to the Sydney
Olympics so most teams that have qualified for the games were here
to test their own as well as their opponents' form and flair.

CAIRO, August 13 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic briefs
from the Middle east countries.
</P>
<P>
ABU DHABI -- National Taxis LLC, the new franchise company, has
hit the roads of the United Arab Emirates from Sunday with 200
taxis to begin with and expects to reach a target of a fleet of 754
between the end of this year and the middle of January, 2001.
</P>
<P>
The launch of the second franchise taxi company was announced by
Suhail bin Maktoum Al Maktoum, chairman of National Taxis LLC.
</P>
<P>
He said the total investment for this project and the cars id
approximately 40 million dirhams (11 million U.S. dollars), adding
that about 200 Galant taxis will be deployed initially, starting
with 50 units the next day.
</P>
<P>
In addition to this, every month, 150 taxis will be released
until the company achieve 754 taxis, he said.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- Two new platforms are under construction at the
Mediterranean harbor of Damietta, north of Egypt, with a length of
550 meters and cost of l06 million Egyptian pounds (about 30
million U.S dollars).
</P>
<P>
The two multi-purpose platforms will have a total annual
handling capacity of 2 million tons, and can dock containers ships
and various cargo and grain ships. They will add to the port's
current capacity of 12 million tons.
</P>
<P>
The construction would be completed in two years to bring the
number of operating platforms at the harbor to 16 connecting Egypt
to Europe and Far East markets.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- Port Said Harbor Authority decided to establish two
desalination plants with a total capacity of 2,000 cubic meters
every day.
</P>
<P>
The two plants, to cost 6 million Egyptian pounds (about 1.7
million U.S dollars) are to be completed together with the harbor-
based giant container platform by next March.
</P>
<P>
Port Said, a leading commercial city and home of an outstanding
free trade zone, lies on the Mediterranean coast, north of Egypt.
</P>
<P>
ALGIERS -- Algerian government adopted a draft bill permitting
foreign and local entrepreneurs to invest in the country's mining
sector.
</P>
<P>
The bill would abolish segregation between local and foreign
investors in the mining sector while it would help lure business
people by securing their right of retrieving prospecting, drilling
and developing expenses, cross country funds transfer, and a
relative risk return.
</P>
<P>
Algerian soil keeps 5 billion tons of iron and more than 2
billion tons of phosphate, but state-run mining companies only
recover 2.5 million tons of iron and 1.8 million tons of phosphate
every year.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Considers Facility for LNG Supply: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, August 13 (Xinhua) -- The Pakistani government has
decided to conduct feasibility studies on the possibility of
supplying liquefied natural gas (LNG) to the Far East and South
East Asia via the country, the Associated Press of Pakistan (APP)
reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
According to official sources quoted by APP, the supply of gas
is possible by providing pipeline facility for gas from countries
in the region to coastal export points in Pakistan from which
onward shipment can be made.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the government has directed the Petroleum Ministry
to accelerate its efforts to provide gas to domestic power
producers and industries.
</P>
<P>
The sources said the cabinet has approved the infrastructure
augmentation plans of Sui Northern Gas Pipeline Co. Ltd. and Sui
Southern Gas Co. for the utilization of additional 928 million
cubic feet of gas per day at an estimated cost of 20.24 billion
rupees (380 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The development of gas infrastructure would facilitate the
substitution of furnace oil with gas in the power generation
sector and industry and thus result in huge saving of foreign
exchange, the sources said.

<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 13 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items
in leading Egyptian newspapers on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Al Ahram:
</P>
<P>
-- President Hosni Mubarak said that Egypt's support to
Palestinian President Yasser Arafat is exclusive to backing his own
decision, taken in the interest of his people.
</P>
<P>
The president made it clear that Egypt does not dictate any
decision to Arafat against his own will or the demands of the
Palestinian people.
</P>
<P>
Al Akhbar:
</P>
<P>
-- Youssef Boutros Ghali, minister of economy and foreign trade,
said the government has paid 8.4 billion Egyptian pounds (2.4
billion U.S. dollars) of arrear debts, which represent the largest
part of arrears.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at an enlarged meeting Saturday at Suez Governorate,
the minister said that this will have a salutary effect on the
market and will activate it.
</P>
<P>
Al Gomhuria:
</P>
<P>
-- Egypt's ambassador to Israel, Mohammed Bassiouni, denied on
Saturday Israeli reports to the effect that Cairo had mediated
secretly between the Palestinians and Israelis in order to push
forward the peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Bassiouni stressed that Egypt was not a mediator in the peace
process, but rather a full partner. He reiterated Egypt's resolute
support for the Palestinian position and its invariable stance vis-
a-vis all the issues discussed.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian Gazette:
</P>
<P>
-- Chief of Egypt's pilots association, Walid Murad, warned U.S.
media Saturday to stop defaming Egyptian pilots in the wake of last
year's EgyptAir crash, and threatened to take legal action
</P>
<P>
The threat followed media smear of the character of relief co-
pilot Gamil al-Batouti after the release on Friday of 1,665 pages
of documents relating to the crash that killed 217 people off the
U.S. coast last October.

<HEADLINE> No Consensus Reached at Camp David: Palestinian Leadership </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GAZA, August 13 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian leadership has stressed
that there was not a single consensus reached on any final-status
issues between Palestinians and Israel during last month's talks at
the U.S.-brokered Camp David summit.
</P>
<P>
This was highlighted in a statement issued after the weekly
meeting of the Palestinian leadership presided over by Palestinian
National Authority (PNA) Chairman Yasser Arafat late Saturday
night.
</P>
<P>
"The Palestinian leadership has been surprised by the false
image painted by the Israeli side that both reached consensus on
all issues except that of Jerusalem at the 15-day marathon talks at
Camp David.
</P>
<P>
The talks ended on July 25, without producing an expected peace
deal between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
"Such an Israeli-propagated image is perfectly untrue and
unrealistic while it is an open attempt by the Israeli side to draw
a picture that it was flexible and ready to make concessions for
the success of the talks," according to the statement.
</P>
<P>
"The reality was that, like the Palestinian side, the Israeli
negotiators expounded their attitudes not only on Jerusalem but on
all issues. However, the two positions remained far apart and all
U.S-led mediation endeavors in this regard were doomed to fail," it
added.
</P>
<P>
"The Israeli side's pretended flexibility is meant to beautify
and solidify the occupation which is absolutely against
international laws and Palestinian legitimate national rights," the
Palestinian leadership said.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian side would continue its political and diplomatic
efforts to rally regional and international support for its stands
on final status issues as well as the declaration on establishing
an independent Palestinian state, scheduled for September 13, they
vowed.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Court Detains Reformist Columnist </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, August 13 (Xinhua) -- Seyed Ebrahim Nabavi, a prominent
pro-reform columnist, was detained Saturday after being
interrogated by the conservative press court, the Islamic Republic
News Agency confirmed on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Nabavi, who was elected "the best satirist" in Iran's Seventh
Press Festival last year, has aroused the anger of the
conservatives for his satires lampooning them, an informed source
told the agency.
</P>
<P>
The satirist once worked for the banned dailies Jameah and
Neshat. He also worked with Nik Ahang Kowsar, a reformist
journalist who was detained last year, to publish a satirical book.
</P>
<P>
According to the unnamed source, another reformist columnist,
Mohammad Qouchani, has also been ordered to appear before Branch
1413 of the Tehran public court on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Qouchani earlier told the Student News Agency that Nabavi's
arrest was part of a conservative crackdown on the pro-reform press
and journalists, which has been stepped up since nascent reformers
overwhelmingly defeated the conservative establishment in
February's parliamentary election.
</P>
<P>
Such arrests are not surprising in the current climate, Qouchani
said.
</P>
<P>
To date, more than 20 pro-reform papers and periodicals have
been suspended and a good number of journalists are in prison for
so-called charges of defamation, violating Islamic values and
advocating pro-American reforms.
</P>
<P>
On August 6, Supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei ordered the
reformist-controlled parliament, which started work on May 27, not
to debate amendments to the restrictive press law.
</P>
<P>
The move, hailed by hardliners, made it almost impossible for
reformers to stop the conservative wave of closing papers and
imprisoning journalists.

<HEADLINE> GCC to Switch to Unleaded-fuel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, August 13 (Xinhua) -- The Gulf Cooperation Council
(GCC) is popularizing unleaded fuel among its six member states to
alleviate harm to environment, according to Sunday's Dubai-based
daily "Gulf News."
</P>
<P>
Among the GCC states, the United Arab Emirates and Oman have
been offering unleaded fuel for some time now, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Saud Arabia has mandated that from the model year
2002, vehicles will be homologated for unleaded fuel only. Under
automobile industry norms, a model year would start from the second
half of the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Bahrain will start offering unleaded fuel from September, while
installation of equipment and public awareness campaigns are
currently under way.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait did so last October, while Qatar started from July, the
paper added.
</P>
<P>
Leaded fuel is harmful to the environment, and studies showed
that respiratory problems are the main reason why children in the
Gulf region miss school.
</P>
<P>
However, the process, by which vehicles are switched over to
unleaded fuel and engineered to meet specific GCC standards, will
start from July, 2001, said local analysts.

<HEADLINE> Mubarak Warns of violence in Case of Concessions on Jerusalem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 13 (Xinhua) -- Any concessions on Jerusalem by the
Palestinians would prompt violence and terrorist acts that can not
be controlled in the Middle East, Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
warned on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"The issue of Jerusalem is the most dangerous and difficult at
the current stage of the Palestinian-Israeli peace talks," Mubarak
said in an interview with Rose al-Youssef weekly carried in its
Sunday edition.
</P>
<P>
"Any Palestinian concessions on Jerusalem will spark an
explosion of the situation in the region in a way that no one will
be able to control," he said, adding that "terrorists will come
back and find strong justification for their actions."
</P>
<P>
Two weeks of negotiations at the Palestinian-Israeli summit at
Camp David in the United States failed to reach a peace deal on
July 25, mainly due to differences over Jerusalem, which both sides
claim as their capitals.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak told the pro-government magazine that he has never and
would never pressure Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat to accept
something that would not secure the interests of the Palestinian
people.
</P>
<P>
Egypt has never imposed any ideas on Arafat and only supports
his decisions to accept what he sees as congruent to the
Palestinian goals and interests, and to reject whatever he sees as
unjust, he reiterated
</P>
<P>
"Arafat's response was succinct and sincere when he told the
Americans and Israelis at the Camp David summit that his own
brother would kill him if he conceded Jerusalem or Al-Aqsa mosque,"
Mubarak said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that nobody in the Arab or Islamic world can agree
to compromise on East Jerusalem or Al-Aqsa mosque, Islam's third
holiest site after Mecca and Medina in Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian president said another Palestinian-Israeli summit
before September 13, the date the Palestinians set to declare
statehood, was "still at the stage of speculation." But he said
Egypt would try to help convene such a summit.
</P>
<P>
Israel occupied Arab East Jerusalem in the 1967 Mideast War and
later declared it its "eternal and indivisible capital," a claim
not recognized by the international community. The Palestinians
want East Jerusalem as the capital of their future independent
state.

<HEADLINE> Major News Items in Leading Israeli Newspapers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 13 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Israeli newspapers on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Vacationing Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak Saturday met
the left-wing Meretz leader Knesset (parliament) member Yossi
Sarid, who later told reporters that they did not discuss coalition
matters.
</P>
<P>
Even so, Barak's invitation was seen as a prelude to the return
of Meretz to the cabinet. Sarid said he and the premier would meet
again soon to discuss the coalition.
</P>
<P>
Three Meretz cabinet ministers resigned on June 21 at the height
of governmental crisis due to the dispute over funding for the
ultra-Orthodox Shas Party's educational network.
</P>
<P>
Ha'aretz:
</P>
<P>
-- Meeting separately with Israeli acting Foreign Minister
Shlomo Ben-Ami and Palestinian National Authority Chairman Yasser
Arafat, European leaders have indicated opposition to a unilateral
declaration of Palestinian statehood.
</P>
<P>
The lack of European enthusiasm for such a declaration has
compelled Arafat to abandon plans to declare a Palestinian state on
September 13, Israeli officials believe.
</P>
<P>
Responding to these developments, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak has revised his peace process timetable, targeting the end of
September as the deadline for completing talks with the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Ma'ariv:
</P>
<P>
-- Eliahu Ben-Elissar, a Holocaust survivor who went on to
become Israel's first ambassador to Egypt and later envoy to
Washington and Paris, died in Paris of heart failure on Saturday at
the age of 68.
</P>
<P>
His death came less than a week after Prime Minister Ehud Barak
informed him that his ambassadorship to Paris would not be
extended.
</P>
<P>
Ben-Elissar, who was close to former Foreign Minister David
Levy, served in Paris from 1998, and before that served for two
years as ambassador to Washington, a post appointed by the then
Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- European leaders have warned Palestinian National Authority
Chairman Yasser Arafat against a unilateral declaration of
independence.
</P>
<P>
German Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer voiced opposition to a
unilateral Palestinian statehood move in a phone conversation with
Israeli acting Foreign Minister Shlomo Ben-Ami. In Russia,
President Vladimir Putin told Arafat he should not issue a
unilateral declaration.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Democrats Criticize Farrakhan for Lieberman Remarks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, August 12 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Democratic Party
Saturday denounced Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan for
suggesting vice presidential candidate Joseph Lieberman, an
Orthodox Jew, may be more loyal to Israel than to the United
States.
</P>
<P>
Farrakhan Friday questioned Lieberman's national loyalty,
asking if his religion made him more faithful to Israel than to
the United States. His comments on Lieberman came just ahead of
the Democratic National Convention in Los Angeles, where delegates
will formally anoint Vice President Al Gore and Lieberman as their
presidential ticket.
</P>
<P>
"I'm sure most Americans would repudiate those remarks," said
Rick Hess, deputy press secretary for the Democratic National
Committee. "There is always that element in America, but it is
distinctly the minority view."
</P>
<P>
Lieberman, a two-term U.S. senator from Connecticut, is the
first Jewish politician to run on a major U.S. political ticket.
</P>
<P>
Gore campaign chairman William Daley said public opinion polls
showed most "American people have no problem in voting for a
Jewish candidate," but it remained to be seen how voters would
respond in November. "We'll find out," Daley said.
</P>
<P>
Political analysts believe that Lieberman's selection by Gore
is testing the extent to which U.S. voters are comfortable with
the idea of a Jew holding the nation's second-highest post -- one
in which he would assume the presidency should the president die
in office or for other reasons be unable to exercise his power.
</P>
<P>
Appearing on CNN's "Larry King Live" earlier this week,
Lieberman rejected suggestions that his religion would influence
his policies regarding Israel.
</P>
<P>
"In my work in the Senate, and if I am honored and fortunate
enough to become the vice president of the United States, my first
and primary loyalty is, of course, to the United States of America,
" Lieberman said.
</P>
<P>
But Lieberman also said he backed moving the U.S. embassy in
Israel to West Jerusalem from Tel Aviv, a move analysts say could
provoke a potentially explosive reaction in the Arab and Muslim
world because Palestinians regard East Jerusalem as the capital of
a future Palestinian state. Israel sees the whole of Jerusalem as
its "united and eternal" capital.
</P>
<P>
The 58-year-old lawmaker came to national prominence in
September 1998 when he was the first Democratic senator to
denounce President Bill Clinton's affair with White House intern
Monica Lewinsky as morally wrong.
</P>
<P>
Analysts say Gore apparently chose the Connecticut lawmaker
more for his centrist politics, his streak of independence and his
unquestioned moral stature than because of his religion.
</P>
<P>
One example is Lieberman's commitment to a strong national
defense policy, which on some military issues has sometimes put
him at odds with his fellow Democrats.
</P>
<P>
Lieberman backed the U.S. invasion of Panama in 1989 and was
one of 10 Democrats in the Senate, including Gore, who voted for a
resolution backing the U.S.-led Gulf War in 1991.

<HEADLINE> Polls Show Gore Still Trails Bush Before Convention </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, August 12 (Xinhua) - Two days before Monday's
Democratic National Convention in Los Angeles, four polls showed
that Vice President Al Gore still trailed far behind Republican
presidential candidate George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
The four new public opinion polls showed Bush, the governor of
Texas, leading Gore by between 9 and 14 percentage points. That
was somewhat less than a week ago indicated Gore had reaped a
modest boost from his choice of Connecticut Senator Joseph
Lieberman to be his running mate.
</P>
<P>
The results of the polls were: CNN -- Bush 53 percent, Gore 39;
CBS -- Bush 48, Gore 38; ABC -- Bush 52, Gore 43; Newsweek -- Bush
48, Gore 38. The CNN poll was conducted among likely voters, the
other three among registered voters.
</P>
<P>
Gore campaign chairman William Daley said the upcoming
Democratic National Convention in Los Angeles would help Gore
erase the deficit. "We ought to wait until after the convention
and see all of the polls," he said.
</P>
<P>
"What we have to do is watch this week, listen to what Joe
Lieberman and Al Gore are talking about, listen to what the
Democratic Party is putting out the specific plans on behalf of
working families, and I think then you'll see a major shift,"
Daley told CNN.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a fund-raising event Saturday in Los Angeles,
President Bill Clinton gave an enthusiastic endorsement to the
Gore-Lieberman ticket, saying they would continue the prosperity
the country is now enjoying.
</P>
<P>
"This is the week that Al Gore and Joe Lieberman get to make
their case to the American people the way their (Republican)
counterparts did in Philadelphia," Clinton said. "I'll bet they'll
be far more specific about what they're for, because we don't have
to hide what we're for."

<HEADLINE> New Insurance Choices Appear in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, August 13 (Xinhua) -- Insurance firms in China have
introduced a series of new dividend-paying insurance options this
year.
</P>
<P>
The new options enable policy-holders to share insurers'
profits by offering dividends.
</P>
<P>
Experts referred to the shift from traditional insurance
methods as part of China's effort to prepare the life insurance
sector for the country's anticipated entry into the World Trade
Organization (WTO).
</P>
<P>
Wu Xiaoping, vice-chairman of the China Insurance Regulatory
Commission, said that China's life insurance sector is expecting
fierce competition from overseas insurance companies once the
country enters the WTO.
</P>
<P>
The most pressing task facing the domestic life insurance
sector now is to sharpen its international competitiveness by
improving management and providing better services, Wu told an
international forum on the management and development of China's
life insurance here.
</P>
<P>
China's insurance sector has maintained an annual average
growth rate of nearly 40 percent since the country resumed
insurance business in the early 1980s.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the sector reported a premium income of 139.3
billion yuan (about 17 billion U.S. dollars), 62.6 percent of
which came from life insurance.
</P>
<P>
However, Wu said, the Chinese insurance market has witnessed a
slowdown in growth since last year.
</P>
<P>
"The insurance sector is at the critical stage of a shift from
traditional insurance coverage, which was similar to savings
deposits," Wu said, stressing that the shift requires a change in
business concept and an overall improvement in management.
</P>
<P>
According to Wu, insurance methods that enable policy-holders
to share insurers' profits by offering dividends are now
dominating the insurance market in developed countries such as the
United States.

<HEADLINE> Holyfield Wins Unanimous Decision </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 12 (Xinhua) -- Evander Holyfield battled
back in the late rounds Saturday to win an unanimous decision over
John Ruiz in Las Vegas and become the first boxer in history to
win portions of the heavyweight title four times.
</P>
<P>
At the age of 37, Holyfield displayed only flashes of the
fighter who beat the likes of Mike Tyson and Riddick Bowe, going
12 rounds before winning the WBA title vacated by Lennox Lewis.
</P>
<P>
Fighting a boxer who had never been in a title fight before,
Holyfield won by only one point on two ringside scorecards and
four points on a third. He fought best in the final round, when he
battered a tiring Ruiz to seemingly pull the fight out.
</P>
<P>
In a fight that was entertaining but hardly a heavyweight
classic, Ruiz exposed Holyfield's deteriorating skills much as
Lewis had in a controversial draw and win over Holyfield that made
him the undisputed champion.
</P>
<P>
But in the end, it was the ring generalship in his 20th title
fight that allowed Holyfield to dominate the final round and pull
out the win.
</P>
<P>
Holyfield (37-4-1) earned five million U.S. dollars for the
fight and Ruiz (36-4) got 1.1 million dollars.

<HEADLINE> Sydney Awash with Illegal Sports Drugs: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, August 13 (Xinhua) -- Sydney was awash with illegal
sports drugs being stockpiled for the Olympic Games, a newspaper
investigation showed Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Sunday Telegraph said a journalist approached dealers at an
inner-city gym with a shopping list and walked away with 1,200
dollars (about 708 U.S. dollars) of banned anabolic steroids.
</P>
<P>
The lucrative trade, the paper said, was bolstered by a complex
operation with bogus Australian firms using licences to export
animal steroids to countries such as Mexico and recycling them
back to the black market.
</P>
<P>
The paper said inner-city gymnasiums were hotbeds for dealers
in the illegal steroid trade and bio-hazard containers (for the
safe disposal of syringes) in the men's and women's toilets were
overflowing.
</P>
<P>
Trainers, it said, regularly injected their clients. Behind the
backs of fitness centre owners, bodybuilders acted as the frontmen,
informing prospective clients of the availability of steroids and
setting the price.
</P>
<P>
Despite a crackdown on legitimate sources, such as doctors, the
drug syndicates that run the trade are confident there will be
plenty of steroids and other performance enhancing drugs on the
market to supply demand through the Olympics.

SINGAPORE, August 13 (Xinhua) -- The Singapore government
reportedly collected a whopping 15.5 billion Singapore dollars (9.
1 billion U.S. dollars) in tax revenue in the first half of this
year, up 24 percent or 3 billion Singapore dollars (1.8 billion U.

high and the taxman's haul is expected to exceed the record 30.6
billion government operating revenue collected in 1997 before the

</P>
<P>
It said the jump was boosted by an economy in top gear which
led to higher personal incomes and, in turn, more personal
spending.
</P>
<P>
It was noted that Singapore's growth rate in tax revenue was
higher than the growth figure of its GDP which expanded by 8.8
percent in the first half of the year compared with a year ago.
</P>
<P>
Economists were quoted as saying the tax revenue rose with the
economy's strong performance and people are simply spending more.
</P>
<P>
This has translated into strong retail sales which have also
been helped by increased visitor arrivals from the region, they
said.

BEIJING, August 13 (Xinhua) -- China's computer exports
enjoyed a record year-on-year 665.63 percent growth to hit 967,900

this year.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, China's computer imports dropped 8.73
percent with a total value of 44.77 million US dollars according
to today's "China Daily,"
</P>
<P>
"The computer trade is going a steady and healthy way, but
there are still problems," said Wang Shuangxian, an official of
the Ministry of Information Industry (MII).
</P>
<P>
Wang said large room exists between the average value of
exported computers and imported units. The average value of an
exported computer was only 397.71 US dollars, much lower than 1,
677.98 US dollars averaged for an imported computer.
</P>
<P>
China turned out 2.88 million computers from January to June

whole year will surpass five million units.
</P>
<P>
China's imports of computers and related external products from
the U.S. reaching 914.58 million US dollars from January to June
this year, with the export volume reaching 2.13 billion US dollars.
This means that the U.S. still maintains the position as China's

<HEADLINE> More China-Made Sewing Machines Exported </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 13 (Xinhua) -- China's exports of sewing
machines and related parts saw a year-on-year 64 percent rise to
192.22 million US dollars during the first half of this year,
today's "China Daily' reported.
</P>
<P>
"The exports are increasing rapidly and the perspective (of
exports) in the second half of the year is also encouraging," said
He Ye, secretary general of the China Sewing Machinery Association.
</P>
<P>
Previously, China-made sewing machines could only be sold in a
handful of countries and regions, but have since been marketed
worldwide from Asia to Europe and America.
</P>
<P>
This is a result of the global economic recovery and a more
mature domestic sewing machinery industry, said He.
</P>
<P>
Domestic makers produced high quality and hi-value-added sewing
machines by upgrading manufacturing equipment, introducing
advanced technologies, and developing new products on their own.
</P>
<P>
In 1999, China's sewing machinery industry had eight billion
yuan in output value, accounting for 0.1 percent of the nation's
GDP.
</P>
<P>
China accounts for 45 percent of the world's output of sewing
machinery, but its transaction value only seized five of the
global total.
</P>
<P>
This indicates that China still has a long way to go in
improving the quality, varieties, prices and services in the
industry, He said.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Calls for Lifting of Sanctions on Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, August 13 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President Abdurrahman
Wahid called for the lifting of international sanctions against
Iraq and said he would visit that country in the coming months.
</P>
<P>
"Indonesia would like to see the blockade on Iraq lifted soon,"
Wahid said after meeting visiting Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez
here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
He added that he would visit Baghdad at the end of this summer.
"
</P>
<P>
Chavez, who arrived here Saturday morning for a brief visit as
part of his tour of countries of the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries (OPEC), shared the view, saying the U.N.
sanctions against Iraq were an injustice causing intense misery to
the country's children.
</P>
<P>
"Who has the right to (cause) an innocent child to die there.
Let God have pity on the souls of those who act that way. I think
the time has come for it to be over," Chavez was quoted by
national newspapers Sunday as saying.
</P>
<P>
The sanctions were imposed after Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990.
</P>
<P>
Chavez earlier paid a brief visit to Baghdad, where said he met
with President Saddam Hussein.
</P>
<P>
Wahid said that during his 90-minute meeting with Chavez, the
two countries had agreed to cooperate in oil and gas exploration.
</P>
<P>
"We have agreed on the idea of forming a joint effort to
explore Indonesia's oil and gas resources and to develop the
economy in general," he added.
</P>
<P>
Chavez, whose country currently holds the revolving presidency
of OPEC, is due to travel from Jakarta to Libya, Nigeria and
Algeria, before returning next week to Caracas where an OPEC
summit has been scheduled to be held from September 27 to 30.
</P>
<P>
He said that he had come to Indonesia to invite Wahid to attend
the summit and that Wahid had accepted.
</P>
<P>
Chavez left Jakarta for Tripoli, Libya, Saturday afternoon.

MANILA, August 13 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Philippine newspapers Sunday.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Malchow Goes to Sydney with Youngest Swimmer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Malchow was on pace to break his own world record of 1:55.18 in
the 200m butterfly before fading badly in the final 50 meters.
However, he still got the Olympic ticket with a winning time of 1
minute 56.87 seconds.
</P>
<P>
Closing fast, Phelps touched home in 1:57.48 to earn the second
Olympic berth, becoming the youngest American swimmer for the
Olympics since 1932, when 13-year-old Ralph Flanagan competed in
the Los Angeles Games.
</P>
<P>
"Phelps is awesome," said Malchow, 23, "I might have retired a
little sooner with someone like that coming up. He didn't get
caught up in the hype, which is a credit to him. He stuck to his
game plan."
</P>
<P>
Phelps, a native of Baltimore who turned 15 on June 30,
actually made the team with ease, cruising away from Jeff
Somensatto (1:58.07).
</P>
<P>
Cristina Teuscher, who won a gold in the Atlanta Games on a
relay, dominated the women's 200m individual medley, finishing in
2:13.36 to beat runner-up Gabrielle Rose (2:14.95) by nearly two
seconds. Rose made her second straight Olympic team with two
different countries. She represented Brazil in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Lindsay Benko of Los Angeles captured the night's other final
of the women's 200m freestyle. She swam 2:00.45 to edge Rada Owen,
who claimed the second spot at 2:00.54 over a fading Samantha
Arsenault.
</P>
<P>
"It wasn't my best time, but I got my hand on the wall first,"
the 23-year-old Benko said. "I've been swimming for 17 years and I
couldn't imagine what my life would be like without it."
</P>
<P>
Arsenault, who had the fastest time Friday in both the
preliminaries and semifinals, had her slowest time (2:00.79) of
those three races. Yet, she will still go to Sydney for the relay.

<HEADLINE> Surin Wins 100m at Canadian Olympic Trials </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
OTTAWA, August 12 (Xinhua) -- Sprinter Bruny Surin cruised to
a 100 meters final victory with a wind-aided time of 10.05 seconds
at the Canadian Olympic athletic trials in Victoria on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Surin easily beat runner-up Brad McCuaig before about 3,000
spectators at Victoria's Centennial Stadium. Surin said he was
pleased with his time with just five weeks left before the
Olympics.
</P>
<P>
"I'm confident right now," said Surin. "I have been running
very good in training. I know my body and I need this kind of time
right now."
</P>
<P>
McCuaig ran a 10.18 and finished under the time needed to
qualify for the Olympics, but won't be going to Sydney because of
a tail wind which was over two minutes per second.
</P>
<P>
Surin's Olympic teammate and Atlanta Olympic gold medal winner
Donovan Bailey did not race because of an injury but will still
have a spot on the Olympic team.
</P>
<P>
Bailey pulled out of the three-day Olympic trials, which end
Sunday, because of a sore hamstring muscle. Bailey watched the
race from the sidelines and said he is looking forward to
competing down under.
</P>
<P>
"The big show is in Sydney. That's where I am going to give it
all I got," he said.
</P>
<P>
Little known Nicolas Macrozonaris finished fourth in the final
but ran a personal best 10.19 to win his heat and put himself in a
position to go to Sydney.
</P>
<P>
The 19-year-old's time is well under the Olympic qualifying
standard of 10.25. But Canadian athletics coach Brent McFarland
said they would have to review the results before adding his name
to the Olympic team.
</P>
<P>
In the men's high jump, Mark Boswell, who finished second at
the world championships in 1999, leaped 2.31m but was unable to
beat his Canadian record of 2.35.
</P>
<P>
Kwaku Boatang also qualified for the Olympics with a jump of 2.
25m to finish second.
</P>
<P>
"This is a stepping stone for me to the big meet in Sydney,"
said Boswell. "We have two great high jumpers who are going to
make the finals in Sydney."

<HEADLINE> Malchow Wins 200m Butterfly in U.S. Olympic Trials </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 12 (Xinhua) -- Tom Malchow, world record-
holder in the men's 200m butterfly, lived up to his reputation by
claiming the title by huge margin in the U.S. Olympic swimming
trials in Indianapolis Saturday evening.
</P>
<P>
As expected, Malchow, 23, led from the very first 50m to time
in 1:56.87, a 1.69 seconds away from his own world record, which
he set up two months ago in Charlotte, slicing Pankratov's five-
year-old mark.
</P>
<P>
The second place was snatched by 15-year-old teenager Michael
Phelps in 1:57.48.
</P>
<P>
Malchow has dominated the event from the preliminaries by
clocking in 1:55.67 in the heats on Friday, namely 0.5 seconds off
his world best performance.
</P>
<P>
The women's 200m individual medley also produced one swimmer
standing out from the rest of the pack as Cristina Teuscher
finished in 2:13.36, beating Gabrielle Rose to a distant second in
2:14.95.
</P>
<P>
However, her winning timing is still a too far cry from the
world mark of 2:09.72 set by the Chinese Wu Yanyan in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The other final of the women's 200m freestyle proved to be a
fight to the
finish as Lindsay Benko, who swam the second-fastest in the
semifinals on Friday, triumphed in 2:00.45, followed by Rada Owen
in 2:00.54.
</P>
<P>
Samantha Arsenault, who qualified first in 2:00.08, settled for
a miserable third place in 2:00.79.

<HEADLINE> China to Develop Rail Transit System in Big Cities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 13 (Xinhua) -- China is expected to invest more
than 130 billion yuan to develop rail transit system in over 10
big cities within the next five years, today's " China Daily"
reported.
</P>
<P>
By 2005, nearly 400 kilometers of rail transit systems will be
added to the current 120 kilometers, according to the China
Communications and Transportation Association.
</P>
<P>
Qian Yongchang, president of the association, said that the
development of the system will contribute significantly to
alleviating traffic pressures in big cities by providing larger-
capacity and quicker transportation with low pollution.
</P>
<P>
Sources from the State Development Planning Commission said
nearly one-third of rail transit investment will be from the State.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing municipal government allows foreign companies to
invest in and manage some of its rail transit system projects.
</P>
<P>
Many overseas investors are eyeing the tremendous potential of
China's rail transit markets.
</P>
<P>
The central government has encouraged local authorities to use
more domestic-made equipment in the rail transit system.
</P>
<P>
All rail transit system projects are required to use no less
than 70 percent of domestic-made locomotives and other electrical
equipment, said commission sources.

Project to Save Damaged Ozone
</P>
<P>
China has begun a nine-year program to phase out the use of
ozone-depleting substances as cleaning agents to protect the
environment.
</P>
<P>
The program targets industrial enterprises, including
electronics, post and telecommunications, aerospace, aviation,
textiles, machinery, medical appliances, automobile and precision
instruments, which traditionally use ozone-depleting substances as
cleaning agents during production.
</P>
<P>
China called the program its latest effort to implement the
Montreal Protocol on Ozone Depleting Substances (MPODS), which is
expected to finish by late 2009.
</P>
<P>
Northeast China Benefits From Desert-Control
</P>
<P>
The decades long fight toward restoring the desert-plagued
Liaoning Province in northeast China to the tree-filled forest
has paid off.
</P>
<P>
Currently, the province has seen a total economic return of
more than 6.1 billion yuan (735 million U.S. dollars) for its
control efforts over the desert, a local official said.
</P>
<P>
The desert area in Liaoning is now 2.42 million ha, or one-
sixth of the province's total area.
</P>
<P>
Local people began to plant trees in desert areas in the early
1950s, and planted 160,000 ha of trees in sand areas. The
province's forest coverage rate has risen from 2.8 percent in
1950s to present 23.1 percent.

Shanxi Province in north China has accelerated its efforts to
turn low-yield hillside farmland into grassland and woodland.
</P>
<P>
So far this year, more than 40,000 hectares of farmland on
mountain slopes on the middle reaches of the Yellow River has been
turned into grassland or forest, a provincial government official
said.
</P>
<P>
The province is concentrating this work on 16 counties along
the river, which suffer from serious soil erosion.
</P>
<P>
The provincial government has set up a special organ to take
charge of the work, and formulated specific plans and methods for
turning the farmland over to growing grass and trees. Farmers will
enjoy state subsidies and grain allowances after they give up
their farmland.

WASHINGTON, Auguat 12 (Xinhua) -- Serena Williams came back to
score a 4-6, 6-2, 6-3 victory over top-ranked Martina Hingis on
Saturday, winning the final spot of the estyle.com Classic in
Manhattan Beach.
</P>
<P>
The 18-year-old Williams, ranked No. 7 and seeded fifth this
week, was to face the winner of Saturday night's semifinal match
between second-seeded Lindsay Davenport and 18-year-old Elena
Dementieva of Russia in Sunday's final at the Manhattan Country
Club.
</P>
<P>
Williams has beaten Davenport four straight times after losing
the first match between the two, and has never played Dementieva.
</P>
<P>
Williams committed 37 unforced errors, but hit the same number
of winners against Hingis, who made 21 of her 23 unforced errors
in the final two sets and hit only 12 winners.
</P>
<P>
Williams won nine of the final 12 games in the match, which
lasted 1 hour, 55 minutes.
</P>
<P>
She had seven aces to only one for Hingis, but six double-
faults to two for her top-seeded opponent.
</P>
<P>
About her high number of unforced errors, Williams said: "I
know I hit a lot today. Playing against Martina, you have to go
for your shots."
</P>
<P>
There were nine service breaks in the first two sets, but just
one in the third set _ when Hingis committed two unforced errors
to end the eighth game. Williams then held service to end the
match.
</P>
<P>
Hingis said she had several opportunities to take over the
match, but she was unable to do so.

<HEADLINE> Winning Starts for Souness, Tigana, Platt, Moelby </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 12 (Xinhua) -- Graeme Souness' Blackburn Rovers
opened the season with a 2-0 victory over Crystal Palace on
Saturday while Jean Tigana's Fulham scored an equally impressive 2-
0 triumph over Crewe, reports said.
</P>
<P>
Blackburn, Premier League champion five years ago but
relegated in 1999, overpowered Palace at Ewood Park with first
half goals by Nathan Blake and Matt Jansen both from passes by
David Dunn.
</P>
<P>
At Craven Cottage, Barry Hayles break the deadlock for The
Cottagers midway through the second half. Then Louis Saha added
the second 15 minutes from the end.
</P>
<P>
Relegated from the top flight after 14 years, Wimbledon
managed only a 0-0 tie at home to modest Tranmere which played for
the final 32 minutes with 10 men after the expulsion of Sean Flynn.
</P>
<P>
But Watford, which finished last in the Premier League last
term, scored a 2-1 win at Huddersfield with strikes by Neil Cox
and Tommy Smith after an early own goal by Steve Palmer had put
the home team ahead.
</P>
<P>
David Platt's Nottingham Forest started with a 1-0 victory at
home to West Bromwich, the only goal coming eight minutes from the
end from Jon-Olav Hjelde.
</P>
<P>
Barnsley's Carl Regan was the first expulsion of the season,
sent off after only 19 minutes for a dangerous two-footed lunge at
Daryl Sutch. But Dave Bassett's shorthanded team still gained all
three points thanks to a goal from Lee Jones in the second half.
</P>
<P>
Playing in division one for the first time, Gillingham went
ahead against Stockport at Priestfield Stadium but went down 3-1.
</P>
<P>
But another promoted team, Preston, scored a 2-1 victory at
Grimsby with strikes by Michael Appleton and Jon Macken and
Burnley,which also came up from division two, gained a point with
a 1-1 tie at Bolton.
</P>
<P>
Gerry Francis' Queens Park Rangers and Trevor Francis'
Birmingham tied 0-0 at Loftus Road while Sheffield United downed
Portsmouth 2-0 thanks to a Paul Devlin penalty and a Linvoy Primus
own goal.
</P>
<P>
Sunday's division one match is Wolves against relegated
Sheffield Wednesday at Molineux although the big game of the day
is Premier League champion Manchester United against FA Cup winner
Chelsea in the Charity Shield at Wembley. The Premier League
campaign kicks off next weekend.
</P>
<P>
Managed by former Liverpool and Denmark midfielder Jan Moelby,
league newcomers Kidderminster Harriers began with a 2-0 victory
over Torquay in division three.
</P>
<P>
Stewart Hadley gave the home fans an early goal at Aggborough
Stadium and 38-year-old Welsh international Barry Horne hit the
second with an audacious 30-meter volley.
</P>
<P>
In Scotland, Hibernian took over at the top of the Premier
League with a 5-1 crushing of surprise leader Dundee.

<HEADLINE> Henman Enter Final by Beating Kuerten in Cincinnati </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
WASHINGTON, August 12 (Xinhua) -- The Briton Tim Henman, who
beat Pete Sampras earlier in the week, advanced to the final of
the Tennis Master Series-Cincinnati with a 6-7 (11),6-4, 7-6 (0)
victory over Brazil's Gustavo Kuerten in Mason, Ohio on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
 The match lasted 2 hours, 36 minutes, two minutes shorter
than Kuerten's quarterfinal match when, as on Saturday, he called
for a trainer to apply a Band-Aid to a blister on his right ring
finger, according to reports.
</P>
<P>
 In Sunday's final, Henman will play the winner of the
semifinal between seventh-seeded Thomas Enqvist of Sweden and
unseeded Arnaud Clement of France. Heading into their match late
Saturday, Clement was the only player who had not lost a set this
week.
</P>
<P>
The 13th-seeded Henman sensed he was playing the best tennis
of his career when he beat defending champion Sampras. He had been
0-6 for his career against Sampras.
</P>
<P>
Henman might have ended the match much sooner if he had not
double-faulted three times in the first-set tiebreaker. One double-
fault cost him a set point when he was up 6-5. The other, at 11-12,
gave the Brazilian the set.
</P>
<P>
Henman won the second set thanks to a single break of serve in
the fifth game. After that game, Kuerten called for medical
attention to his finger.
</P>
<P>
"I had a lot of big points and couldn't convert anything,"
Kuerten, who despite the loss will still be atop the ATP
Championship Race next week, was quoted as saying.

<HEADLINE> S.African, Rwandan Presidents Vow to Push Peace Process in Congo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, August 13 (Xinhua) -- South African President Thabo
Mbeki said here Sunday that he is optimistic something will come
out from Monday's summit aimed to put the peace process in the war-
torn Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) back on track.
</P>
<P>
"We are meeting in order to get the Lusaka peace agreement
fully implemented and all the signatories are very keen to see
that the results are achieved," Mbeki said on arrival in the
Zambian capital to attend the summit under the auspices of the
Southern African Development Community (SADC).
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Rwandan President Paul Kagame called for an end to
the two-year war in the DRC.
</P>
<P>
"All we are here for is to see an end to this mess in Congo,"
Kagame said on arrival at Lusaka International Airport Sunday
evening.
</P>
<P>
He said that the meeting should not be wasted but instead
should see the advancement and moving forward in the
implementation of the ceasefire agreement signed one year ago by
all warring parties to the conflict.
</P>
<P>
If all the parties meet tomorrow and discuss the problems in
the implementation of peace process, there is no reason why there
should be no end to the mess in the DRC, Kagame said.
</P>
<P>
All leaders of the six countries involved in the conflict,
namely the DRC and its allies Zimbabwe, Namibia and Angola, as
well as Rwanda and Uganda who back rival Congolese rebel groups
are expected to attend the summit chaired by Zambian President
Fredrick Chiluba.

<HEADLINE> Venezuelan President Warns Against Lowering Oil Prices </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 14 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Venezuelan President Hugo
Chavez Monday called on oil-producing countries to resist demands
to cut oil prices in the international market, saying the current
prices were fair and any attempt to change them would be passing a
death sentence on their countries.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a joint press conference in the Nigerian capital
Abuja on Monday with his Nigerian counterpart Olusegun Obasanjo,
Chavez said some powerful countries were using blackmail to force
down the price of the crude oil in spite of the fact that buyers
made as much as 100 U.S. dollars from each barrel of the commodity
bought at less than 30 dollars.
</P>
<P>
He complained that buyers from some industrially developed
nations deliberately branded OPEC members as "bad guys, devil and
a club endangering the world economy" in respect of the price and
quantity of crude pushed into the market.
</P>
<P>
He suggested that OPEC member states should learn when to cut
down on production, ensure discipline among them and comply with
the rules and instructions of the organization.
</P>
<P>
Chavez said he had visited nine heads of state of OPEC member
countries to lobby for stability in the price of the crude oil in
the international market.
</P>
<P>
Chavez, arrived in Nigeria on Sunday for a two-day working
visit, is currently visiting the member states of the Organization
of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) in his capacity of
OPEC chairmanship for the scheduled OPEC summit in Venezuela's
capital Caracas next month.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria, Venezuela Sign Cooperation Agreement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 14 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria and Venezuela Monday
signed a bilateral agreement covering cooperation in the areas of
oil, agriculture and solid minerals, the News Agency of Nigeria
reported.
</P>
<P>
The agreement is one of the main outcomes of Venezuelan
President Hugo Chavez's two-day official visit to Nigeria starting
on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Chavez hailed at a press conference in Abuja that the agreement
had created strategic alliance between Nigeria and Venezuela.
</P>
<P>
He said Venezuela was ready to go into joint exploration with
Nigeria in areas of iron ore and bauxite, adding that "the sky was
the limit of the success" of such venture since the two countries
have a lot of historical and geographical similarities.
</P>
<P>
Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo, who held talks with
Chavez earlier, said on the same occasion that the agreement just
signed would open the doors for more co-operation and
collaboration between the two countries in particular, as well as
Africa and Latin America in general.

<HEADLINE> Summit on Congo Conflict Opens in Zambia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, August 14 (Xinhua) -- A summit aimed at putting the
peace process back on track in the Democratic Republic of the
Congo (DRC) opened here Monday morning with the presence of all
the warring parties involved in the two-year war.
</P>
<P>
Zambian President Frederick Chiluba, peace broker of the DRC
conflict, said at the opening meeting that a number of positive
developments have taken place since the first summit of
signatories of the Lusaka ceasefire agreement held here last
February.
</P>
<P>
However, the Zambian president said the period also witnessed
many negative developments which pose a threat to the entire peace
process.
</P>
<P>
The negative developments included ceasefire violations and
continued difficulties in the deployment of the U.N. military
personnel, he said.
</P>
<P>
The ongoing summit will discuss among other things ceasefire
violations, delay in the deployment of the U.N. peacekeeping
forces and observers and delay in the convening of the inter-
Congolese political negotiations.
</P>
<P>
On August 15 and 24 the U.N. Security Council will consider the
extension of the mandate of U.N. observer mission in the DRC
beyond August 31, Chiluba said, calling on the summit to send a
clear message of assurance and encouragement to the U.N. Security
Council that these issues have been satisfactorily addressed and
right conditions have been created for the deployment of the U.N.
mission.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba urged all the warring parties to demonstrate the spirit
of give and take and to have unity of purpose, determination and
the necessary political will to implement the Lusaka agreement.
</P>
<P>
"The DRC peace process is ours. It is an African initiative
intended to provide solutions to an African problem. We initiated
it, negotiated it, and signed the agreement. We must now implement
it fully," Chiluba said.
</P>
<P>
Presidents of the DRC, Zimbabwe, Namibia, Rwanda and Uganda are
attending the meeting, while Angola is represented by its Defense
Minister. Leaders of rebel groups are also present at the meeting.
</P>
<P>
The DRC conflict has sucked in Zimbabwe, Angola and Namibia,
which support DRC President Laurent Kabila, and also Rwanda and
Uganda, which back different rebel groups in the DRC to fight the
Kabila government.

<HEADLINE> OAU Chief Urges Congolese Warring Parties to Implement Peace Accord </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, August 14 (Xinhua) -- Salim Ahamed Salim, Secretary-
General of the Organization of African Unity (OAU), Monday urged
all warring parties involved in the two-year war in the Democratic
Republic of the Congo (DRC) to show their political will to
implement the Lusaka ceasefire agreement they signed one year ago.
</P>
<P>
At the opening meeting of the summit held here Monday in an
effort to put the peace process back on track in the DRC, the OAU
chief called for an immediate end to the now frequent ceasefire
violations.
</P>
<P>
He said that "the failure more than one year after the signing
of the agreement to make any significant progress in implementing
its provisions, has brought about despair within the Congo and
frustration in the international community".
</P>
<P>
Salim called on the signatories to the agreement to show in
words and deeds that they remain committed to the agreement, which
remains the most viable framework for restoring peace and
stability in the DRC.
</P>
<P>
Presidents of DRC, Zimbabwe, Namibia, Rwanda and Uganda are
attending the meeting, while Angola is represented by its Defense
Minister. Leaders of rebel groups are also present at the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Others present at the meeting include presidents from Tanzania,
Mozambique and South Africa as well as representatives from the U.
N., the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa, and the
Southern African Development Community.
</P>
<P>
The conflict in the DRC has sucked in Zimbabwe, Angola and
Namibia, which support DRC President Laurent Kabila, and also
Rwanda and Uganda, which back different rebel groups in the DRC to
fight the DRC government.

<HEADLINE> U.N Sets No Pre-Conditions for Deploying Troops in Congo: Diplomat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, August 14 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations is not setting
pre-conditions on the deployment of its planned over 5,500
peacekeepers and observers in the Democratic Republic of the Congo
(DRC), but rather wants assurance of the safety of its personnel
once deployed in the war-torn country, a senior U.N. official said
here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
U.N. Ambassador Kamel Morjane said at the opening of the second
summit of signatories to the Lusaka ceasefire agreement held here
on Monday, despite continued ceasefire violations in some parts of
the DRC, the U.N. has embarked on a mobilization exercise of peace
observers to be sent to DRC in accordance with U.N. Security
Council Resolution 1291 of February 24, this year.
</P>
<P>
The diplomat observed that there is need for all the parties
involved in the DRC conflict to demonstrate their willingness to
accommodate the U.N. personnel.
</P>
<P>
Continued fighting in the DRC has hampered the deployment of
the U.N.forces and observers.

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 14 (Xinhua) -- South African police Monday
confiscated 30 kilograms of cocaine at Johannesburg International
Airport, the biggest seizure this year and one of the biggest ever
in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
The police told South African Press Association that the drugs
were worth about 9 million rand (about 1.3 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Inspector Peter Mars, one of the officers who arrested a 39-
year-old Brazilian man when he arrived on a South African Airways
flight from Sao Paulo, said the man was believed to be a courier
for a syndicate.
</P>
<P>
Mars said the man looked suspicious, leading police officers to
single him out.
</P>
<P>
"He didn't know where to go. He looked very nervous. As soon as
his suitcase was opened one could see it had a false compartment.
The bag was also very heavy, even though it only contained a few
items of clothing and shoes," Mars said.
</P>
<P>
He added that the most common drugs smuggled into South Africa
were cocaine, Mandrax, ecstasy and heroin.
</P>
<P>
The suspect will appear in a local court on Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Angola to Sign Protocol on Free Trade Within SADC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, August 14 (Xinhua) -- Angola is preparing to sign a
free-trade protocol that rules trade and economic exchanges among
the member countries of the Southern African Development Community
(SADC), said an official from the Angolan Foreign Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Rui Mangueira, director of the Regional Economic Integration of
the Foreign Ministry, was quoted here on Monday by the official
news agency Angop as saying that "it's fundamental for Angola to
integrate itself, effectively, with the economies of other SADC
member countries, through the entrance into the free-trade zone of
the community."
</P>
<P>
Mangueira added that after two years of studies on the impact
of the protocol on the Angolan economy, all the conditions have
been created for the Angolan adhesion to the free-trade protocol.
</P>
<P>
"So Angola should accede to the protocol, for it has created
mechanism for concretizing its intention, especially a mission
that will function in the head office of SADC, in Gaborone,
Botswana," Mangueira said.
</P>
<P>
According to the protocol, member countries adhering to it will
reduce the rate of custom duties of the "non-sensitive products"
to zero by 2008 and then gradually decrease the duties of the "
sensitive products".
</P>
<P>
Ten of the 14 member countries of SADC have signed and approved
the free-trade protocol, which include Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi,
Mauritius, Namibia, Tanzania South Africa, Mozambique, Swaziland
and Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
Angola, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Seychelles
have not signed on the protocol while Zambia has signed but it has
not been approved by the parliament.

<HEADLINE> Southern Africa Expects Cereal Deficit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, August 14 (Xinhua) -- The Southern African Development
Community (SADC) Food Security Sector projects a cereal deficit of
487,000 tons for the 2000/2001 marketing year, the Zimbabwe News
Agency reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The food security sector said in an annual report that the
deficit was caused by a number of natural and economic factors
including the Cyclone Eline which induced floods that hit Botswana,
Mozambique, South Africa and Zimbabwe, all of which are SADC
member states.
</P>
<P>
Cereals, particularly maize, are the staple food grains for the
200 million people in the region and any shortage means sections
of that population will have to rely on imports for sustenance,
said the report.
</P>
<P>
The expected cereal output of 27.05 million tons falls short of
the total requirements estimated at 27.53 million tons, including
2.3 million tons needed for replenishing strategic grain reserve
stocks.
</P>
<P>
The report said it should be noted that cereal deficits in some
countries do not necessarily mean food insecurity as financial
resources are available to import cereals.
</P>
<P>
The sector had embarked on a project to improve the quantity
and quality of food security training, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
"It will strengthen the capacity of the centers and market
support functions to be carried out by a regional training unit
based in Harare," it said.

<HEADLINE> SADC Urged to Produce Local Arms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 14 (Xinhua) -- The Southern African
Development Community (SADC) needs an industry to manufacture arms
in the region and for the region, former Zimbabwean army general
Tshinga Dube said here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the Africa Defense 2000 meeting, Dube said such an
industry will produce arms appropriate to local conditions, keep
money in the region and create jobs.
</P>
<P>
Dube, who is now Chief Executive of Zimbabwean Defense
Industries, said it is wasteful for the region to spend billions
of U.S. dollars purchasing military hardware from European
countries.
</P>
<P>
"A mechanism can be put in place whereby industries are set up
in countries according to the resources available to them. An
industry to manufacture brass cartridges of different caliber may
be set up in Zambia where there are large reserves of copper," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"Likewise Zimbabwe with plenty of iron and still coupled with
its sophisticated foundries can produce cast products like mortars
and artillery shells," he added.
</P>
<P>
Dube called on SADC member states to come together and
consolidate their defense industries.
