<HEADLINE> Two Die in Ohio Train Collision </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NAPOLEON, Ohio (AP) -- Three freight trains crashed into each  
other early Sunday, killing two crew members and derailing cars 
over a quarter-mile of tracks near Bryan. 
</P>
<P>
	One engine burned for hours and the wreckage blocked a main  
railroad route between the East and Chicago. A handful of homes in 
Bryan, about 50 miles west of Toledo, were evacuated for several 
hours. 
</P>
<P>
	Fog limited visibility during the 2 a.m. crash, Jay Kivowitz,  
investigator for the National Transportation Safety Board, said at 
a news conference in the nearby town of Napoleon. He said it was 
too early to determine a cause. 
</P>
<P>
	Dozens of freight cars and pieces of broken train parts were  
scattered across the two tracks that run parallel through the flat 
farmland of northwest Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
	R.H. Bell, 57, of Oregon, Ohio, and R.A. Corell, 52, of Angola,  
Ind., were killed in the accident. Both were thrown from the engine 
and died of head injuries, said Coroner John Moats. 
</P>
<P>
	A train taking mail from Morrisville, Pa., to Chicago hit  
another westbound train carrying trailers and containers from 
Boston to Chicago, said Bim McGeehan, a spokesman for 
Philadelphia-based Conrail. The victims were on the mail train. 
</P>
<P>
	A third train, with 50 empty cars, hit debris from the crash.  
The train was traveling east from Portage, Ind., to River Rouge, 
Mich., near Detroit, McGeehan said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sixteen cars from the three trains derailed in the accident.  
</P>
<P>
	McGeehan said track, computer and electronic signals are  
supposed to keep trains from getting too close to each other. He 
said he did not know how fast the trains were going when they hit 
each other. 
</P>
<P>
	Train traffic was being rerouted through a line in Michigan  
until debris can be cleared and the track repaired, McGeehan said.

<HEADLINE> War on Drugs Turns to Classrooms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	State and federal law enforcement officials say that cutting off  
the supply of illegal drugs may be impossible. So, they are trying 
harder to curb demand. 
</P>
<P>
	Over the past five years, the Office of National Drug Control  
Policy in Washington has increased federal money for prevention by 
33 percent and boosted the money for drug treatment by 38 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's really the heart and soul of what we're doing, combined  
with continuing stiff law enforcement,'' says Barry McCaffrey, 
director of the ONDCP. ``We want to keep the social disapproval of 
drug abuse high.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The office recently began a five-year, $2 billion antidrug ad  
campaign aimed at ages 9-19. 
</P>
<P>
	If you can keep a kid in that age group from using marijuana,  
alcohol or tobacco, McCaffrey says, ``he's home free. ``He'll never 
have a compulsive drug-using problem.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The drug policy board's strategy director, Jim McDonough, says  
that today, half of America's students have used drugs by the time 
they graduate from high school. 
</P>
<P>
	``So we're not talking now about a college sophomore smoking a  
joint, we're talking about middle school children becoming exposed 
to dangerous drug abuse,'' McCaffrey says. ``And, oh by the way, 
more eighth graders are using heroin in today's America than 12th 
graders.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sgt. William Davis of the Louisiana State Police spent several  
years doing drug interdiction along Interstates 10 and 20, two 
major drug pipelines that stretch across Louisiana. He remembers 
the frustration of knowing that so much dope was getting past him 
every day. 
</P>
<P>
	According to federal figures, the U.S. federal government spends  
$17.1 billion a year to fight drugs. But the drug cartels are 
making an estimated $52 billion a year on drug sales in this 
country. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't have the resources to combat what the drug dealers  
put into their operations,'' Davis says. ``So education is the 
biggest key right now. I think that's the best way that we in law 
enforcement can go.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Davis, who now does public affairs work for the state police,  
touts efforts police are making to get into schools and teach. 
</P>
<P>
	The same thing is happening in other states across the country:  
police are more proactive in keeping America's youth off drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	But McCaffrey warns that it's a job the police can't do alone.  
</P>
<P>
	``I tell people, you want to fight a war on drugs?'' he says.  
``Sit down at your own kitchen table and talk to your children.''

<HEADLINE> Not All Online Shoppers Pleased </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Mike Fox placed eight orders through online  
retailer Amazon.com with the expectation they would arrive in time 
for his relatives and friends to open on Christmas morning. 
</P>
<P>
	Much to his irritation, six of them were late.  
</P>
<P>
	The Seattle-based company began e-mailing customers on Dec. 21  
to warn them that inventory shortages might cause delays. 
Amazon.com ultimately compensated Fox for the foulup by paying some 
of his shipping costs, but that didn't soothe his feelings. 
</P>
<P>
	``This whole experience was frustrating and embarrassing,'' said  
Fox, a software engineer in North Carolina. ``Amazon was the name I 
trusted the most ... now I know I can't shop there if I need to 
count on something arriving by a certain time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With the holidays now over, horror stories are emerging about  
packages failing to arrive on time, credit cards charged for items 
never purchased and inadequate customer service to handle such 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
	E-commerce soared during Christmas time, as millions of new  
customers tried buying online for the first time. Internet research 
firm Jupiter Communications estimates holiday sales totaled $3.14 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall, customer satisfaction was quite high. Many people found  
what they wanted, easily bought it online and the item arrived on 
their doorstep in time for Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
	But there were glitches that disturbed many shoppers, and  
analysts warn that such problems could turn some shoppers away for 
good. 
</P>
<P>
	A survey of 2,300 online holiday shoppers to be released today  
by Jupiter found that a surprisingly small 37 percent said they 
would spend more next Christmas, while 58 percent said they would 
spend the same and 5 percent would spend less. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can't blow any part of your online game. You can't let  
your customers be disappointed,'' said Farhad Mohit, president and 
chief executive of Los Angeles-based Bizrate.com, an online market 
research firm. 
</P>
<P>
	``Up until now, online merchants worked to acquire customers,  
but now the key has to be making them repeat shoppers,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 270 shoppers filed complaints with the Better Business  
Bureau over Shopping.com, charging that the online store hasn't 
fulfilled orders or provided proper customer service. Of those 
complaints, 199 have been resolved, three are unresolved and 70 are 
pending. 
</P>
<P>
	Other sites, like barnesandnoble.com, the auction house eBay.com  
and toysrus.com, shut down or slowed to a crawl due to heavy 
demand. Some, including macys.com, kept taking orders for inventory 
that was already out of stock. 
</P>
<P>
	Research firm Bizrate.com, based on a survey of 67,000 shoppers  
in the fourth-quarter, found that 96 percent of those who got their 
merchandise on time said they will buy again online, but only 46 
percent of those who encountered delivery problems said they will 
consider making another purchase. 
</P>
<P>
	Realizing that any gaffes can deter shoppers, some merchants are  
already improving their online systems. 
</P>
<P>
	800.com, for instance, upgraded its network to handle more than  
double the traffic. The Portland, Ore.-based consumer electronics 
retailer faced a shutdown in early December when too many shoppers 
logged into its site to buy three movies or CDs for $1. 
</P>
<P>
	Many companies, including department store Azazz.com, let  
consumers get real-time answers to questions about products, 
availability, purchasing and shipping. Others are joining forces 
with shipping companies to allow consumers to track delivery of 
their purchases right from the Web site to their home. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I place an order, I want to know where it is and who is  
bringing it to my home,'' said Peter Nicholls, president of 
TanData, which is partnering with UPS on the tracking software. 
``There is no reason this isn't part of the online experience.'' 
</P>
<P>
	1-800-FLOWERS recently launched its ``Win Back'' program, where  
it calls shoppers who have complained about their online orders. On 
some occasions, the flower-delivery company will also send 
consumers $5 to $50 gift certificates to compensate for poor 
service. 
</P>
<P>
	But the changes still might not be enough to woo some shoppers  
back online. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not so much of a given anymore that a shopper who buys  
online once will buy again,'' said Nicole Vanderbilt, an Internet 
commerce analyst at Jupiter Communications. ``They are becoming 
less forgiving of all the glitches.''

<HEADLINE> Gucci Says LVMH Has 26.7 Pct. Stake </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MILAN, Italy (AP) -- Gucci Group said Sunday that LVMH Moet  
Hennessy Louis Vuitton SA has disclosed it holds about a 26.7 
percent stake in the Italian fashion house. 
</P>
<P>
	``We intend to continue to manage the company independently, in  
a way that maximizes long-term growth and value for shareholders,'' 
Gucci president and chief executive officer Domenico De Sole said 
in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	LVMH said last week that ``in the present circumstances it has  
no plans of making a tender offer for shares of Gucci Group.'' But 
Italian daily Corriere della Sera reported Sunday that an LVMH 
spokesperson wouldn't rule out an increase in the French company's 
stake. 
</P>
<P>
	On Jan. 12, LVMH acquired the 9.5 percent stake that fashion  
house Prada held in Gucci. 
</P>
<P>
	Gucci has said it wasn't consulted regarding LVMH's purchases of  
Gucci shares from Prada. 
</P>
<P>
	LVMH late Friday reported its full Gucci stake to the Securities  
and Exchange Commission. 
</P>
<P>
	Because LVMH and Gucci are both listed on the New York Stock  
Exchange, LVMH's purchase of shares in Gucci last week requires the 
French luxury goods and spirits group to abide by U.S. disclosure 
rules. Those rules state that investments of more than 5 percent in 
a publicly listed company be accompanied by statements of 
intentions to the SEC. 
</P>
<P>
	Gucci shares also are listed on the Amsterdam Stock Exchange.

<HEADLINE> Ford To Shut Down Brazilian Factory </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) -- Unable to operate its plant with nearly  
3,000 dismissed workers inside, the Brazilian subsidiary of Ford 
Motor Co. will shut down its factory until Feb.1, local media 
reported Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford said in a statement the decision was made because of ``the  
technical impossibility of resuming its operation with the daily 
presence of dismissed workers inside its installations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Another roughly 4,000 workers who were not fired were given paid  
leave, said the statement, distributed by Agencia Folha. 
</P>
<P>
	For nearly two weeks, 2,800 Ford workers have been ignoring  
their pink slips, showing up every day for work in an effort to 
force the company to reconsider their dismissal. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford has said the best it could do is reconsider 300 dismissals  
-- mostly of those workers close to retirement age -- and grant an 
unspecified increase in severance pay. 
</P>
<P>
	The Metalworkers Union in Sao Bernardo do Campo, the Sao Paulo  
industrial suburb where Ford's plant is located, said Ford's 
proposal was unacceptable. 
</P>
<P>
	Production at Ford has been stopped since Dec. 21, when year-end  
vacations began. It was supposed to resume on Jan. 4, but because 
of the job action the company refused to activate the assembly 
line. 
</P>
<P>
	The union is trying to force Ford to consider other alternatives  
to the dismissals such as a shorter work week, wage cuts and lower 
production costs. 
</P>
<P>
	The company announced the dismissals on Dec. 18, saying they  
were necessary because of a ``drop in demand.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brazil's auto industry has seen sales plummet since the first  
effects of financial turmoil in Asia reached the country.

<HEADLINE> Giant Funeral Home Merger Approved </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The government approved the merger of two  
giant funeral service and cemetery companies Friday but said one of 
them must divest some of its properties in 14 markets to resolve 
anticompetitive concerns. 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Trade Commission approval of a consent agreement  
effectively allows Service Corporation International to complete 
its proposed acquistion of Equity Corporation International. SCI is 
the world's largest owner of cemeteries and funeral homes and ECI 
is the fourth largest company in the field in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the agreement, SCI is to sell 19 funeral homes and  
cemetery properties in 14 markets to Carriage Service Inc. in 14 
markets. All three companies are headquatered in Houston. 
</P>
<P>
	SCI has approximately 3,200 funeral homes and 400 cemeteries in  
41 states, Canada, Australia and Great Britain. By acquiring ECI, 
it would add 354 funeral homes and cemeteries in 33 states to its 
company. 
</P>
<P>
	The FTC had contested the merger, claiming it would eliminate  
substantial existing competition between SCI and ECI and lead to 
higher prices or reduced services for consumers. 
</P>
<P>
	SCI is required to complete the divestitures to Carriage -- the  
commission-approved acquirer-- within seven days after the order 
becomes final. SCI also must give prior notice to the FTC and 
appropriate attorneys general if it intends to acquire a funeral 
home or cemetery in any of the 14 markets in the next 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposed consent agreement is now open for a 60-day public  
comment period, after which the commission will decide whether to 
make it final. 
</P>
<P>
	The FTC had said the deal raised concerns about competition for  
funeral home services in six geographic markets: Phenix City, Ala., 
and Columbus, Ga.; Evansville, Ind.; Jacksonville Beach, Fla.; 
Roseville, Calif.; Ruskin and Sun City, Fla., and West Pasco County 
and Tarpon Springs, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	It contended the merger also would have had an anticompetitive  
effect on cemetery services in eight markets: Broward County, Fla.; 
Chattanooga, Tenn., and its north Georgia suburbs; Citrus County, 
Fla.; Corpus Christi, Tex.; Eugene and Springfield, Ore.; North 
Richmond, Va., and the northern, eastern, and western suburbs of 
Richmond; the South Bay area of San Diego; and Summit County 
(Akron), Ohio.

<HEADLINE> Broncos Davis Flourishes As Usual </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- While his Denver Broncos foundered for most of the  
game, Terrell Davis flourished -- as usual. 
</P>
<P>
	He rushed for 75 of Denver's meager 108 yards by halftime. Then,  
after the Broncos fell behind 10-0 three minutes into the third 
quarter, Davis got even better. 
</P>
<P>
	He rushed for 6 yards to help set up John Elway's 11-yard  
scoring pass to fullback Howard Griffith. He added a 5-yard gain 
before Jason Elam kicked a tying 44-yard field goal. Then Davis 
ripped off a 20-yard run to set up Elam's 48-yarder, making it 
13-10. 
</P>
<P>
	Finally, with time running out in the quarter, Davis took a  
pitchout on the left side and danced 31 yards for a clinching 
touchdown in the Broncos' 23-10 victory over the New York Jets on 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was just a pitch play where a lot of times the backside is  
going to be open, and you have to be patient with it,'' said Davis, 
who finished with 167 yards on 32 carries. ``I saw the flow going 
left and cut behind a block and saw a seam there and just tried to 
get to the end zone.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Davis, the league's MVP this season after rushing for 2,008  
yards, said a fierce wind which gusted into the 30 mph range 
wreaked havoc with Denver's passing game in the early going. 
</P>
<P>
	But he also said his team needed to calm down.  
</P>
<P>
	``We were a little overanxious. I know I was,'' he said. ``At  
the half, we knew we needed to calm down and just do our jobs, just 
go back to the basics.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Davis and his teammates were aware that Sunday's game was likely  
to be the last at Mile High Stadium for Elway, who figures to 
retire after this season. And that may have played a role in the 
slow start. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody is excited about playing in a game of this  
magnitude, and I think everybody was trying to do too much. And 
some of it could have been because of John. 
</P>
<P>
	``We came out and played a great second half and wore them down  
a little bit,'' Davis said. ``We made better adjustments in the 
second half.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Davis has rushed for at least 100 yards in six straight  
postseason games. In succession, he has run for 184, 101, 139, 157, 
199 and now 167 yards. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the playoffs, I try to focus a little harder,'' he said.  
``I try to catch better and block better and run a little harder.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Davis said he had problems with the wind on a couple of  
pitchouts and he fumbled one of them. Under such conditions, the 
running game becomes especially important and Denver outgained the 
Jets 178-14 on the ground. 
</P>
<P>
	``It doesn't matter if it's a day like today or not,'' Elway  
said. ``You want Terrell Davis back there. He's the best running 
back in the game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the 10-0 deficit that quieted the crowd in the third  
quarter, tight end Shannon Sharpe wasn't worried. 
</P>
<P>
	``I really wasn't concerned when we got 10 down because they  
really hadn't stopped Terrell all day,'' he said. ``With Terrell, 
we could do pretty much what we wanted.''

<HEADLINE> U.S. Ends Nuclear Talks With NKorea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GENEVA (AP) -- With no immediate breakthrough in sight, the  
United States adjourned talks Sunday on gaining access to what it 
believes is an underground site North Korea is using to develop 
nuclear weapons. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Ambassador Charles Kartman and North Korean Deputy Foreign  
Minister Kim Gye Gwan will meet again next weekend after a round of 
more general peace talks during the week, U.S. and North Korean 
diplomats said. 
</P>
<P>
	The wider talks, which start Tuesday, involve North and South  
Korea, along with the United States and China. The four sides 
launched the talks 13 months ago in an effort to replace the 1953 
Korean War armistice with a permanent peace treaty. Until now, 
participants have made only slow headway on procedural issues. 
</P>
<P>
	Progress on the nuclear issue was expected to set the tone for  
the week's four-party talks. 
</P>
<P>
	Washington has so far rejected North Korean demands for $300  
million in compensation to inspect the Kumchangni underground site, 
which was revealed last summer in satellite photos. Pyongyang says 
it needs the money because it won't be able to use the facility 
after outsiders have seen it, but denies it uses the site for 
nuclear weapons. 
</P>
<P>
	Detection of the site has renewed fears about the nuclear  
ambitions of the North's reclusive Communist government and 
inflamed tensions on the divided Korean peninsula. 
</P>
<P>
	The North Korean and American diplomats, who refused to give  
their names, gave no details about the adjourned round of weekend 
talks. 
</P>
<P>
	North Korea's foreign minister told journalists earlier that the  
two sides were ``stuck'' in the opening sessions Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know whether we will manage to overcome our  
differences,'' Kim said before Sunday's meeting at North Korea's 
lakeside diplomatic mission. 
</P>
<P>
	Kartman left the meeting without comment. ``I will do my best,''  
was all he said beforehand. 
</P>
<P>
	Two previous rounds of U.S.-North Korean talks in Washington and  
New York failed to make any progress. 
</P>
<P>
	Dispute over the underground site has compounded the tensions  
raised when North Korea fired a rocket over Japan at the end of 
August. The United States believes North Korea launched a ballistic 
missile, and it is now working with Japan to develop a new 
missile-defense system. 
</P>
<P>
	Congress has pressured the Clinton administration to cut  
financial aid for a nuclear energy project agreed upon in 1994 if 
North Korea doesn't accept an inspection at Kumchangni. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration has ruled out paying any cash to North Korea  
to inspect the site, but has hinted that it might send more 
humanitarian aid to help ease food shortages and malnutrition among 
the 22 million North Koreans.

<HEADLINE> Rapper ODB Arrested After Shootout </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Rapper ODB was arrested on a charge of attempted  
murder after a shootout with police -- the latest addition to a 
growing nonmusical rap sheet. 
</P>
<P>
	Russell Jones, the real name of the Wu-Tang Clan singer also  
known as Big Baby Jesus, and another man were driving a sport 
utility vehicle with its headlights off when police tried to pull 
them over in Brooklyn. 
</P>
<P>
	An unmarked police car with four plainclothes officers chased  
Jones after he tried to flee, police said. He was later pulled over 
and when two officers approached, two shots were fired from the 
drivers side, police said. Police returned fire as Jones drove off 
again. No one was injured. 
</P>
<P>
	Another police car stopped Jones a few blocks away and he was  
arrested. 
</P>
<P>
	Police found the second man shortly after in a nearby building  
and questioned him. He was released and was not charged in the 
incident, said Officer Olga Mercado, an NYPD spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones, 29, faces charges of attempted murder, attempted  
aggravated assault on a police officer and criminal possession of a 
weapon. He was to be arraigned Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the fourth time the rapper has been arrested since July.  
</P>
<P>
	In November, he allegedly threatened to kill his former  
girlfriend -- the mother of their 1-year-old child -- after climbing 
over a security gate to enter the property where she worked. 
</P>
<P>
	He was charged with threatening to kill security officers last  
September at a blues club in West Hollywood, Calif., and in July he 
allegedly stole a pair of shoes in Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones faced various larceny, assault and fraud charges going  
back to 1987, Mercado said. He's also been accused of being a 
deadbeat dad for failing to pay court-mandated child support to 
three of his children, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	At the Grammy Awards last year, Jones crashed the stage and  
hijacked a microphone from singer Shawn Colvin. Angry at having 
lost in the best rap album category to Sean ``Puff Daddy'' Combs, 
Jones complained that he had spent a lot of money for new clothes 
because he thought he would win.

<HEADLINE> Pentagon Drops Bid To Review Book </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Defense Department is backing off a demand  
that Scott Ritter, a former U.N. weapons inspector in Iraq, submit 
advance manuscripts of a book he is writing that is expected to be 
critical of Clinton administration policy. 
</P>
<P>
	David Rigby, chief of public affairs at the Defense Threat  
Reduction Agency, said Sunday a contracting officer wrote to Ritter 
last month that he was obligated to submit his planned work for a 
pre-publication security review. 
</P>
<P>
	Ritter, a former Marine officer, resigned as a U.N. inspector  
last summer and has complained repeatedly that the administration's 
policy to disarm President Saddam Hussein's Iraqi military is 
ineffectual and wrong-headed. 
</P>
<P>
	Responding to a New York Times story Sunday in which Ritter's  
attorney, Matthew L. Lifflander, objected to the Pentagon agency's 
letter, Rigby said officials determined that because Ritter no 
longer is under contract to the Defense Department, he is not 
legally obligated to submit writings for review. 
</P>
<P>
	``We would work with him to ensure that there is no release of  
classified material,'' Rigby said. ``But that is an offer, not a 
demand.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If Ritter refuses the Pentagon's offer to check his book for  
classified material in advance of its publication, the matter will 
be dropped, the spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ritter had been under contract to the On-Site Inspection Agency,  
an arm of the Defense Department, when he was a member of UNSCOM, 
the U.N. Special Commission supervising the disarming of Iraq's 
chemical and biological weapons. The U.S. inspection agency has 
since merged with other Pentagon organizations to form the Defense 
Threat Reduction Agency. 
</P>
<P>
	Rigby said the Dec. 23 letter was sent in good faith and  
reflected concern that Ritter might inadvertently disclose 
classified information in his book, to be published this spring by 
Simon &AMP; Schuster. But he said it was a mistake to indicate that 
Ritter was legally obliged to submit his writings in advance. 
</P>
<P>
	The Times report quoted Lifflander as saying Ritter was unlikely  
to agree to a prepublication security review and that if the 
Pentagon pressed the matter it could end up in court. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawyer also accused the Pentagon of trying to intimidate  
Ritter into silence, but Rigby rejected any such suggestion. ``We 
are not trying to hassle him,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Air Force Explains Rocket Explosion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- An Air Force Titan rocket carrying a spy  
satellite blew up in August because of wire insulation damage, the 
Air Force said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The explosion erupted in a spectacular fireball, showering more  
than $1 billion in flaming debris over the Atlantic Ocean near the 
launch site at Cape Canaveral, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement released at the Pentagon, the Air Force Space  
Command said an accident investigation board determined that 
``electrical shorts in the vehicle power supply ... wiring harness 
most likely caused the vehicle to catastrophically fail 41 seconds 
into powered flight.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Space Command is based at Peterson Air Force Base, Colo.  
</P>
<P>
	``The board found clear and convincing evidence that wire  
insulation damage existed in the (vehicle power supply) wiring 
harness, resulting in at least one powered conductor with exposed 
wire that went undetected during pre-launch inspections and tests. 
After liftoff, the exposed wire intermittently shorted as vehicle 
vibration increased,'' the statement said. 
</P>
<P>
	The 20-story Titan 4 -- the largest unmanned rocket in America --  
pitched downward and exploded without warning. Two seconds later, 
Air Force launch controllers sent a self-destruct command to break 
the rocket into smaller pieces and reduce the threat to people on 
the ground. 
</P>
<P>
	The rocket was supposed to put a classified satellite for the  
National Reconnaissance Office into orbit. 
</P>
<P>
	The Air Force statement said the accident cost more than $1  
billion, counting the launch vehicle, satellite and launch 
preparation.

<HEADLINE> Plan: Medicare To Pay for Insurance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Medicare would shift to helping elderly  
Americans buy health insurance instead of paying individual medical 
bills, as it does now, under a proposal a reform commission is 
considering. 
</P>
<P>
	The resulting competition among private health plans to attract  
elderly customers and their new Medicare subsidies could help the 
program save money and adapt to rapid technology changes, 
supporters say. 
</P>
<P>
	Both taxpayers and retirees, however, would have to pay more if  
health care prices continue to rise. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, lawmakers still would likely have to decide how to save  
more money when the number of people on Medicare almost doubles 
from today's 39 million as baby boomers begin retiring. 
</P>
<P>
	``Even if we're extraordinarily successful ... at keeping the  
per capita costs limited, there has to be some way to finance care 
for that many people,'' said John Rother, of the nation's largest 
organization of older adults, AARP. 
</P>
<P>
	Consensus is growing among members of the National Bipartisan  
Commission on the Future of Medicare to make the program work more 
like health benefits many companies and the federal government 
offer workers. 
</P>
<P>
	Under such a system, sometimes called ``premium support,'' a  
retiree could choose from a menu of government-approved health 
insurance plans and receive a Medicare subsidy to help cover the 
enrollment fee, or premium. 
</P>
<P>
	``It incorporates the changes ... in the needs and interests of  
the people much faster,'' said Rep. Bill Thomas, R-Calif., who 
co-chairs the commission and is among those working out details of 
such a proposal. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission must recommend by March 1 changes to the health  
care program for the elderly and disabled. Congress and the 
president would make final decisions. 
</P>
<P>
	Some commission members are skeptical that such a system could  
guarantee adequate protection to poor or sick Medicare 
beneficiaries. 
</P>
<P>
	``Premium support is nothing but a voucher system,'' said Rep.  
Jim McDermott, D-Wash. ``Unless there's a guarantee that every plan 
gives the same benefit package to anybody who buys it, and that you 
and I get it at the same price, this is going to be bad for the 
sick elderly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Currently, Medicare pays most people's medical bills directly,  
making cost control difficult. 
</P>
<P>
	Beneficiaries in many parts of the country can choose to enroll  
in a private managed-care health plan already. But with monthly 
payments based on the program's overall costs, some argue that 
money lost to inefficiency is compounded. 
</P>
<P>
	In contrast, if Medicare adopted premium support, insurance  
companies of all kinds -- not just managed care -- could compete for 
government contracts to provide a basic package of benefits. Those 
benefits likely would include at least what the program now covers. 
</P>
<P>
	Medicare would negotiate with the plans to get the best possible  
deals, then set an annual subsidy based on a percentage of the 
average bid. 
</P>
<P>
	For example, if Congress decided Medicare should pay 80 percent  
of people's insurance premiums and the plans' average bid was 
$5,000, the government subsidy would be $4,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
	Most retirees could end up paying significantly more or less  
than that $1,000, however. That's because different plans' total 
premium prices would vary. Plans offering extra perquisites might 
be more expensive, for example. 
</P>
<P>
	The familiar, government-run Medicare system also would remain  
available. But if it doesn't prove as efficient as the private 
plans, premiums would go up. 
</P>
<P>
	``Technically, a premium support is a form of a voucher, but it  
is a voucher that grows with the cost of the average health plan 
over time,'' said Stuart Altman, a Brandeis University professor on 
the Medicare commission. 
</P>
<P>
	In other words, if the price of insurance rises, taxpayers would  
directly share the burden. 
</P>
<P>
	The idea is likely to get support from Republicans in Congress,  
who have suggested vouchers as a solution to limit other government 
costs such as for education.	   Depending on the details, it also could appeal to Clinton 
administration officials who say they're open to options that would 
guarantee essential health benefits at a reasonable price. 
</P>
<P>
	Even if substantial consumer protections are built in, however,  
premium support would not be painless. 
</P>
<P>
	Currently, Medicare beneficiaries pay a standard monthly  
premium. At $45.50 this year, it covers about 10 percent of the 
program's costs and is scheduled to rise slowly over the next 
decade until it covers about 14 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The Medicare commission could recommend adjusting that ratio --  
having taxpayers cover a smaller percentage of each retiree's costs 
as the number of retirees grows, for example. 
</P>
<P>
	Or the panel could simply suggest the premium-support model --  
and let Congress decide how best to spread rising Medicare costs. 
Among the options: a sliding scale of subsidies so that wealthier 
retirees pay more.

<HEADLINE> Tokyo Stocks Rise Sharply / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Tokyo stock prices advanced sharply in early  
trading Monday as fears about a financial meltdown in Brazil 
abated. The dollar was higher against the yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose 225.33 points,  
or 1.64 percent, to 13,964.19 in the first 30 minutes of trading. 
On Thursday, the average gained 335.26 points, or 2.50 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar was traded at 114.18 yen, up 0.72 yen from late in  
Tokyo on Thursday and also above its late level Friday in New York 
of 114.13. 
</P>
<P>
	Japanese financial markets were closed Friday for a national  
holiday. 
</P>
<P>
	Tokyo stocks moved higher as investors were heartened by a  
recovery in U.S. and other world stock exchanges following moves by 
the Brazilian government to stabilize its economy, Latin America's 
largest. 
</P>
<P>
	``As worries over Brazil's financial crisis eased in the  
overseas markets, the Tokyo market continues to rebound,'' said 
Sachio Ishikawa, general manager of the stock division at Chuo 
Securities. 
</P>
<P>
	Brazil caused a panic in world financial markets Wednesday when  
it devalued its currency, the real, by 8 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	But the country's decision not to intervene to support the real  
generated confidence that the government was taking appropriate 
measures to nurse the economy back to health. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, the Dow Jones industrial average rose 219.62 points  
to 9,340.55, making up a large portion of the 522 points it lost 
earlier in the week. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section was up 11.55 points, or 1.08 percent, to 1,081.49. 
The TOPIX closed up 12.86 points, or 1.22 percent, Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency dealings, the dollar rose against the yen as  
optimism about Brazil's financial situation eased concern about the 
potential damage the crisis could cause to the U.S. economy. 
</P>
<P>
	The euro was quoted at 131.61 yen early in Tokyo, down from  
132.30 yen late Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the benchmark No. 182 10-year Japanese government  
bond fell to 1.635 percent from 1.685 percent Thursday, driving 
it's price up to 101.34 yen from 100.93 yen.

<HEADLINE> 12 Hurt in Mich. Freeway Pileup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Up to 50 cars and trucks smashed together Sunday  
in a massive freeway pileup a witness described as a ``pinball 
machine'' of wreckage. The accident was blamed on black ice, fog 
and high speed. 
</P>
<P>
	The chain-reaction crash on Interstate 94 just south of Detroit  
injured at least a dozen people, one critically with injuries to 
her head, pelvis and legs. 
</P>
<P>
	Ed Jankow had been driving westbound on the interstate to his  
job at Detroit Metropolitan Airport in nearby Romulus when he 
spotted the accident ahead. 
</P>
<P>
	Seconds after pulling to the shoulder and stepping from his car,  
other vehicles slammed into his. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was lucky that I was standing on the median,'' the  
52-year-old Clinton Township man said. ``The way they were bouncing 
off each other (was like) a pinball machine. 
</P>
<P>
	Michigan State Police Trooper John Sosa said the fog and drivers  
moving too fast ``coupled with the black ice on the roadway caused 
cars to spin out of control. Those factors spelled nothing but 
trouble.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The woman who suffered the worst injuries was listed in critical  
condition at the University of Michigan Medical Center in Ann 
Arbor, University of Michigan Health System spokesman Pete Barkey 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ten other victims were treated either at hospitals in Dearborn  
and Taylor for slight injuries ranging from cuts to bruises and 
chest pains, officials said. A 12th victim was treated at a 
hospital in suburban Wyandotte and was released. 
</P>
<P>
	The crash forced the freeway's closure in both directions over a  
several-mile stretch for hours. Authorities reopened I-94 to 
eastbound traffic about noon Sunday, two hours before the westbound 
lanes were reopened.

<HEADLINE> Oscar Mayer Recalls Deli Meat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Fears of contamination are prompting Oscar  
Mayer Foods Corp. to recall 28,313 pounds of deli meat from store 
shelves. 
</P>
<P>
	The Madison, Wis. company recalled the meat amid concerns of  
possible contamination with the Listeria monocytogenes bacteria, 
which can cause meningitis and produces such symptoms as high 
fever, severe headache, neck stiffness and nausea. 
</P>
<P>
	The recall, announced Friday, covers two variety pack deli meats  
-- the 10-ounce ``Oscar Mayer All American Variety Pack'' and the 
9-ounce ``Oscar Mayer Club Sandwich Variety Pack.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The packages have the ``Jan 12'' date in the upper left corner  
on the back of the package and bear ``EST 537A'' or ``P-1449'' in 
the U.S. Department of Agriculture inspection mark. 
</P>
<P>
	The products were sliced and packaged on Oct. 29, 1998 and  
distributed throughout the United States as well as in Singapore, 
Bermuda, Aruba, St. Maarten, the Dominican Republic and Puerto 
Rico. 
</P>
<P>
	Inspectors tested packages after a customer became ill in Kansas  
City, Mo. and found positive samples of the bacteria. 
</P>
<P>
	The Agriculture Department said it has no evidence, however,  
linking the product to a nationwide listeriosis outbreak that is 
under investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Listeriosis also can cause miscarriages, stillbirths and fatal  
infections for those with weakened immune systems.

<HEADLINE> Family Ties Bind Impeachment Trials </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Impeachment, a momentous matter of state, is  
also a family affair. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Barbara Boxer, a juror in President Clinton's impeachment  
trial, has a daughter married to the brother of first lady Hillary 
Rodham Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	It's an all-in-the-family ordeal too for the Bennetts, Levins,  
Keatings, Hutchinsons and Frelinghuysens. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Asa Hutchinson, a House prosecutor, can glance across the  
Senate chamber at his brother, Sen. Tim Hutchinson, who sits in 
judgment of the president. The two Republicans from Arkansas, who 
share an apartment here, made a family pact not to broach 
impeachment at the dinner table or anywhere else. 
</P>
<P>
	``We talk about movies or sports or Arkansas or life in general.  
But we just avoid talking about the case,'' the senator said about 
his younger brother, who is too busy with the trial to chat much 
anyway. ``He took the only card table into his bedroom and stays in 
there holed up, doing his work.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asa Hutchinson did break the pact slightly on Thursday, the day  
he debuted as an impeachment prosecutor in the Senate. ``I promised 
him I wouldn't be boring,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	This is actually the second legal go 'round for the Clintons and  
Hutchinsons. 
</P>
<P>
	As a prosecutor in Arkansas in 1984, Rep. Hutchinson worked to  
convict Clinton's brother, Roger Clinton, on federal drug charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Like the Hutchinsons, the Levin brothers, both Democrats from  
Michigan, aren't talking about the impeachment trial either. Sen. 
Carl Levin is a juror in the Senate. His older brother, Rep. Sander 
Levin, voted against impeachment in the House. 
</P>
<P>
	``We haven't discussed it since the trial began, and I don't  
expect that that will change,'' the congressman said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Frelinghuysen family has run into the presidential  
impeachment issue three times in 130 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Rodney Frelinghuysen, R-N.J., voted to impeach Clinton. His  
father, Peter, served in the House when President Nixon headed off 
impeachment by resigning in 1974. And his great-great grandfather, 
Sen. Frederick T. Frelinghuysen, voted to convict President Andrew 
Johnson in 1868. A blue ticket to the 1868 trial, which ended in 
Johnson's acquittal, hangs framed on a wall in the congressman's 
office on Capitol Hill. 
</P>
<P>
	It's a father-son affair for the Kennedys. Rep. Patrick Kennedy,  
D-R.I., voted against impeachment in the House. His father, Sen. 
Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., is in the jury. 
</P>
<P>
	The Keating twins also have gotten embroiled in the impeachment  
controversy over Clinton's affair with former White House intern 
Monica Lewinsky. Timothy Keating was Ms. Lewinsky's immediate 
supervisor at the White House legislative affairs office. His 
identical twin, Tom, is top aide to the sergeant-at-arms in the 
House, which impeached Clinton on charges of lying about the affair 
and covering it up. 
</P>
<P>
	Outside the Capitol, the Bennett brothers sling barbs from  
either side of the aisle. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert Bennett is Clinton's personal lawyer. His kid brother,  
Republican William Bennett, a former education secretary and drug 
policy coordinator, has been sharply critical of the president. 
Bill Bennett just wrote a book called ``Death of Outrage: Bill 
Clinton and the Assault on American Ideals.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Family ties tangled up President Johnson's trial in 1868 as  
well. 
</P>
<P>
	Occupying seat No. 66 in the Senate chamber was Sen. David  
Patterson of Tennessee, married to President Johnson's daughter, 
Martha. 
</P>
<P>
	No surprise, Patterson voted to acquit. After all, they were  
kin. ``It would have made for very difficult family relations if he 
had voted the other way,'' Senate historian Donald Ritchie said. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, it's Boxer, D-Calif., who's in a delicate spot.  
</P>
<P>
	Her daughter, Nicole, married the first lady's younger brother,  
Tony Rodham, at a White House wedding in 1994. Last weekend, 
Clinton the defendant attended a family birthday soiree with Boxer 
the juror.

<HEADLINE> Charlton, Newcastle Tie in Soccer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Charlton, with second-half substitute Martin  
Pringle scoring three minutes into injury time, tied Newcastle 2-2 
Sunday in the only game in the Premier League. 
</P>
<P>
	Charlton ended its run of eight straight losses in the league.  
</P>
<P>
	The late goal -- with Newcastle playing a man short -- came just  
seconds after Mark Bright appeared to have scored the tying goal on 
a shot that appeared to have crossed the line. 
</P>
<P>
	Temuri Ketsbaia gave Newcastle a 1-0 lead in the 13th minute.  
Nolberto Solano of Peru made it 2-0 in the 55th before Bright 
scored for Charlton in the 64th. 
</P>
<P>
	Newcastle played the last 13 minutes with 10 players when  
Nikolaos Dabizas was sent off in the 77th minute with his second 
yellow card. 
</P>
<P>
	The tie left Ruud Gullit's club in 14th place with 25 points,  
far off the pace of league-leading Chelsea (43), Manchester United 
(41), Aston Villa (40) and defending champion Arsenal (39). 
Charlton has only 17 points. 
</P>
<P>
	In Premier League games Saturday, it was: Chelsea 2, Coventry 1;  
Derby 1, Blackburn 0; Leeds 2, Middlesbrough 0; Leicester 2, 
Manchester United 6; Liverpool 7, Southampton 1; Nottingham Forest

<HEADLINE> Judge To Rule of Hoffman Lawsuit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A judge is expected to rule within a week on  
Dustin Hoffman's $5 million lawsuit claiming a magazine used a 
computer-altered image of him in a dress without his permission. 
</P>
<P>
	The actor, who played a man masquerading as a woman in the 1982  
film ``Tootsie,'' sued in 1997 over a Los Angeles Magazine layout 
that included a computerized composite of his face on the body of a 
man wearing a designer gown. 
</P>
<P>
	The photo caption read: ``Dustin Hoffman isn't a drag in a  
butter-colored silk gown by Richard Tyler and Ralph Lauren heels.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hoffman testified during the four-day trial that the picture  
turned him into an unpaid fashion model. 
</P>
<P>
	In his closing argument, Steven Perry, an attorney for the  
magazine, said the photo portrayed Hoffman's character in 
``Tootsie'' rather than the actor himself. The defense also argued 
that it was protected by the First Amendment.

<HEADLINE> John Elway Couldn't Leave a Loser </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- He was not going to leave this place a loser.  
</P>
<P>
	Not for the last time. Not without a fight.  
</P>
<P>
	Not John Elway.  
</P>
<P>
	After wrestling with his emotions and questions about retirement  
all week, then being buffeted by swirling winds and the Jets' 
defense for a half, Elway turned as tough as the weather. He led 
the Broncos on four straight scoring drives in a 12-minute stretch 
of the third quarter Sunday to manufacture a 23-10 win in the AFC 
Championship. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither the comeback nor the stats were vintage Elway -- the  
first came way too early, the second were not worthy of a passer 
who has established himself as perhaps the NFL's best during the 
last 16 seasons. But by the end, retirement was still a question 
and not a demand. 
</P>
<P>
	``My main focus is to finish this year,'' Elway said, ``before l  
figure out the next one.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Judged by deed instead of word, he has most likely played his  
last game in Denver. He took a victory lap at the end of this one, 
rare for a player who treats praise the same way he does defensive 
lineman -- by scrambling. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was kind of unusual for him,'' Broncos coach Mike Shanahan  
said. ``I had to encourage him to do it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For most of the day, it looked like Elway wasn't going anywhere.  
Instead, he now goes on to Miami and the Super Bowl to face an 
Atlanta team coached by Dan Reeves. The same Dan Reeves who used to 
coach in Denver and fired Shanahan as his quarterback coach 
because, Reeves said, Shanahan and Elway were usurping his 
authority behind his back. 
</P>
<P>
	If so, neither one would say anything even mildly critical that  
would find its way back to him -- particularly on this day. 
</P>
<P>
	``At times,'' Shanahan said, ``we were best friends.''  
</P>
<P>
	``He's a great football coach,'' Elway said.  
</P>
<P>
	A moment later, someone asked Elway whether he hoped this would  
be the last time the Reeves-revenge angle is mentioned. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't wish for things that are not going to happen,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	All things considered, though, the questions could have been  
worse.

<HEADLINE> Brazil Crisis Bad for US Automakers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The currency crisis that hit Brazil last week  
means bad news for automakers such as General Motors and Ford, 
whose operations there are already suffering from a deep recession. 
</P>
<P>
	But many financial companies like Citigroup may not fare as  
badly because they have trimmed back their exposure in Brazil 
following earlier upheavals in Asia and Russia. 
</P>
<P>
	For U.S. companies that have Brazilian operations which export --  
such as the appliance maker Whirlpool -- the crisis creates 
conflicting factors that make their outlook uncertain. 
</P>
<P>
	Brazil, the largest economy in Latin America, is in the midst of  
economic stagnation and high unemployment stemming partly from the 
government's policy of keeping interest rates a sky-high 30 percent 
to attract foreign investors. To help keep those investments 
stable, the country has been spending millions in dollar reserves 
to prop up the value of its currency, the real. 
</P>
<P>
	But investors worried about Brazil's future have been lately  
been exiting the nation in droves, causing the real to plummet. On 
Friday, the government temporarily abandoned its unsuccessful 
support of the real, allowing it to fall even further. 
</P>
<P>
	While that gave Brazilian businesses hope that interest rates  
will soon come down and the economy will start growing, the drop in 
the real means U.S. companies will have a harder time exporting 
goods to Brazil. Any currency drop in a country makes foreign goods 
more expensive there. 
</P>
<P>
	Brazil's recession and high interest rates have already  
clobbered sales of big-ticket items, which many Brazilians buy on 
credit. Sales of autos and household appliances, U.S. industries 
that have significant operations in Brazil, both declined around 25 
percent last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ford had hoped to make money in Brazil this year, but now they  
may lose between $100 and $200 million. Likewise for GM,'' said 
Maryann Keller, an auto analyst with ING Baring. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford Motor Co. recently laid off 2,800 workers at one of its  
Brazilian plants, but many of those workers have returned to the 
factory staging protests and demanding their jobs back. Local media 
reported Sunday that Ford plans to shut down its plant until Feb. 1 
because of the disruptions. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the problems, Ford spokeswoman Caroline Burke says the  
company remains optimistic about Brazil over the long term and is 
proceeding with plans for a new vehicle plant, the company's fourth 
in Brazil, which will cost $700 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Whirlpool Corp. has seen its sales of refrigerators, clothes  
washers and air conditioners slump badly in Brazil, but the company 
may actually benefit from the currency devaluation. 
</P>
<P>
	The weak currency makes exporters based there more competitive  
by allowing them to sell their goods more cheaply overseas. That 
could help Whirlpool's Brazil-based maker of refrigerator 
compressors, which is one of the largest in the world. 
</P>
<P>
	It's still not clear what the combined impact of Brazil's  
troubles will be on Whirlpool, chief financial officer Ralph Hake 
says. ``I think we're going to have to let this thing evolve.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Other U.S. business are sure to be hurt because of the spending  
cuts expected to be made by large companies and the government, 
which is trying to cut Brazil's massive budget deficit. That could 
hit makers of office equipment like Xerox Corp. as well as makers 
of computers and other high-tech equipment. 
</P>
<P>
	On the other hand, some U.S. banks appear to be well prepared  
for the trouble. Ever since suffering losses in the financial 
blowups in Asia and Russia last year, these banks have been 
reducing their risk in volatile developing markets such as Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
	For instance, Citigroup has cut its total exposure in Brazil,  
including loans, investments and other assets, to $3.9 billion as 
of September 1998 versus $4.4 billion at the end of 1997. Banks 
have also been taking more steps to reduce their risk from currency 
fluctuations. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is something they haven't just woken up to,'' said Diana  
Yates, a banking analyst at A.G. Edwards &AMP; Sons. ``They were 
properly positioned for this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts expect consumer products makers like Colgate-Palmolive  
Co. and Gillette Co. to pull through. Sales of daily necessities 
like soap and toothpaste often do steady business even in economic 
downturns. 
</P>
<P>
	And, for a few companies, Brazil's problems may even have a  
silver lining. Avon Products Inc., which counts Brazil as its 
second-largest market outside of the United States, says its 
operations there are ``very robust.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Avon added 100,000 new representatives last year in Brazil as  
people tried to supplement their eroding income. It now has a sales 
force of 500,000 there. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you're in 45 different countries you're always going to  
have ups and downs in different markets,'' said company spokesman 
Brian Martin.

<HEADLINE> Baldwin Not Ready To Run for Office </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Alec Baldwin won't be following in the footsteps  
of Clint Eastwood, Ronald Reagan or Sonny Bono any time soon. 
</P>
<P>
	The actor says his political activism and fundraising for the  
Democrats is not leading up to a run for office. 
</P>
<P>
	``I see now the danger of how people launch political careers,''  
Baldwin said in an interview on WNBC-TV that aired Sunday. ``They 
go to enough of these events where people say, 'When are you going 
to run?' And they buy it and they believe them. 
</P>
<P>
	``Having people suggest to you that you might be a good  
candidate and actually becoming a full-bodied, red-blooded 
candidate for office are two completely separate and distinct 
things.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Baldwin reiterated his support for President Clinton and  
criticized New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, but put to rest 
any rumors that he might be willing to take Giuliani on in a race 
for New York's Senate seat in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	``Do I want to get in there and spend my life trying to undo the  
monolithic, sharklike machine of Giuliani? That's a big task.'' 
Baldwin said. ``Giuliani's a powerful guy. Giuliani's been a 
successful guy. Whoever runs against Giuliani's gonna have a tough 
time in the Senate race.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The mayor has not formally declared his candidacy for the Senate  
but is considered a likely contender.

<HEADLINE> Dog Day Care Center Has Digital Cam </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Barbra Waldare's doggie day care center has  
everything a canine could want, including brisk walks and a 
nail-clipping service, along with something no one else has -- 
Internet surveillance. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the first one I've heard of,'' said Michael Walters,  
an American Veterinary Medical Association spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
	Opened just two months ago, the Doggie View Day Care Center in  
Studio City has a digital camera linked to a Web site 
(www.doggieview.com) so clients can check up on their pets anytime 
during the day. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of people are more upset about leaving their dog than  
their dog is,'' Waldare explained. 
</P>
<P>
	Such pet pampering is a booming industry, fueled by affluent  
baby boomers whose grown kids have left home and by younger, 
two-income childless couples. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. pet industry is worth $21 billion, with consumers  
spending 33 percent more in 1996 than they did in 1994 on roughly 
the same number of pets, according to the most recent industry 
estimates. 
</P>
<P>
	Doggie View, which charges $25 per day per dog, has six regular  
clients, including a golden retriever from Seattle, Wash., named 
Tango. Tango's owner, Cathi Linden, is undergoing surgery and 
wanted to be able to view her pet while hospitalized. 
</P>
<P>
	Linden said she could have boarded Tango closer to home but  
``they don't have online viewing and they don't have dog walks.''

<HEADLINE> Collector Buys 'Sybil' Paintings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Thirty stark watercolors painted by the woman  
believed to be ``Sybil'' -- the subject of a best-selling book and 
TV movie about a woman with multiple personalities -- sold for at 
least $30,000 at an art show Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Shirley Ardell Mason, believed by her psychiatrist to have had  
16 personalities, was a trained artist who painted throughout her 
life. She died in February 1998 in Lexington, Ky., at age 75. 
</P>
<P>
	A collector from Leawood, Kan., who did not want to be  
identified, bought the paintings, said Rod Lich, the dealer of the 
paintings 
</P>
<P>
	Lich would not disclose how much each of the paintings sold for,  
but said the buyer had paid the asking amount of between $1,000 and 
$3,500 for each of the 30 paintings, putting the total between 
$30,000 and $105,000. 
</P>
<P>
	``Most of the interest is in the fact that it's 'Sybil,''' said  
Lich, a folk art specialist from Georgetown, Ind. ``It's not New 
York City high-style art.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Prospective buyers had also called from Los Angeles and Arizona,  
though few who came to the show Saturday came away impressed. 
</P>
<P>
	The pseudonym given the psychiatric patient in Flora Rheta  
Schreiber's 1973 book ``Sybil'' was Sybil Isabel Dorsett. Mason has 
long been suspected of being ``Sybil.''

<HEADLINE> Falcons Injury-Prone QB Stands Tall </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- So many times during his injury-plagued  
career, Chris Chandler found himself crumpled on the turf. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Atlanta Falcons quarterback was standing tall and proud  
Sunday. After 11 years and six teams, he's going to the Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had to overcome a lot and I never gave up, despite some poor  
years,'' Chandler said after guiding the Falcons to a 30-27 
overtime victory over the Minnesota Vikings. ``Now, I find myself 
in a good situation and it's very rewarding.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 33-year-old Chandler bounced from Indianapolis to Tampa Bay  
to Phoenix to Los Angeles to Houston -- never staying anywhere for 
more than a couple of years -- before the Falcons acquired him 
before the 1997 season for a couple of low-round draft picks. 
</P>
<P>
	Even coach Dan Reeves has admitted that he didn't know how good  
a quarterback he was getting, and how could he? Chandler rarely 
managed to play a full season because of injuries, earning the 
nickname ``Chris Chandelier.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday, they should have called him John Elway. Chandler  
directed an eight-play, 71-yard drive that tied the game at 27 with 
49 seconds remaining. He completed four of six passes for 56 yards 
and also had a 9-yard run that left him briefly hobbled with a shin 
injury. 
</P>
<P>
	``It wasn't anything major,'' said Chandler, who shook off the  
pain and his past. Three plays later, he threw a 16-yard touchdown 
pass to Terance Mathis for the tying touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
	In overtime, Chandler and the Falcons put together another  
memorable drive after taking over at the Atlanta 9, moving 70 yards 
in 10 plays to set up Morten Andersen's game-winning, 38-yard field 
goal. Chandler completed all three of his passes, accounting for 47 
yards, and had another big run for 6 yards. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was very special the way we won that football game,'' said  
Chandler, who has been named to the Pro Bowl twice since coming to 
Atlanta. ``You look back at the way our season went and this game 
symbolizes our season. We had to overcome a lot of things to win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With Jamal Anderson held to 67 yards on 23 carries, it fell to  
Chandler to bail out the Falcons from a 20-7 deficit. He completed 
27 of 43 passes for 340 yards, including three touchdown passes. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we do running the ball is important,'' Chandler said,  
``but it can't be done without our passing game. We've proven all 
season long that we can throw the ball, we can make some big plays. 
We did that today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reeves, who coached Elway in Denver, said few quarterbacks could  
have duplicated Chandler's performance against the Vikings. 
</P>
<P>
	``I told him after we went down there and tied the score, that  
tanks right up there with any of the big-time quarterbacks,'' the 
coach said. ``He's done it with the pressure on him, made some 
big-time throws, did it after being hurt from the scramble, hung in 
there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Before the season, the Falcons signed Chandler to a four-year,  
$25 million contract extension that would keep him in Atlanta 
through 2002. 
</P>
<P>
	``I told him we were going to stick our neck out to sign him  
because I thought he could win a Super Bowl for us,'' Reeves said. 
``Now, he's one game away from doing that, and I think he's good 
enough to do it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But first, Chandler has other concerns. His wife, Diane, the  
daughter of ex-quarterback John Brodie, is expected to give birth 
to the couple's third child any day now. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, it's off to Miami.

<HEADLINE> Australian Open Kicks Off Tonight </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) -- Lindsay Davenport kicks off the  
Australian Open on Monday, surrounded by the grand dames of the 
grand slams and knowing that, at last, she's one of them. 
</P>
<P>
	No one intimidates her any longer. No one holds a psychological  
edge against her before the match even begins. 
</P>
<P>
	Not two-time defending champion Martina Hingis, whom Davenport  
beat in straight sets Saturday to capture a tuneup tournament in 
Sydney. 
</P>
<P>
	Not Steffi Graf, who has four Australian Open titles sprinkled  
among her 21 grand slam wins, and who also lost to Davenport in 
Sydney. 
</P>
<P>
	Not Monica Seles, who has never been beaten by anyone in four  
visits to Australia. 
</P>
<P>
	Not Conchita Martinez, the former Wimbledon winner who  
dispatched Davenport in the semifinals a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	For half a dozen years since her debut Down Under as a chubby  
teen, Davenport has arrived slimmer, faster and better each time. 
It helped, but not enough. On a high-bouncing, slow rubberized 
court perfectly suited to her baseline style, Davenport would find 
ways to lose and leave in disappointment. 
</P>
<P>
	She handled defeat graciously, just as she always handled her  
victories in lesser tournaments and her one golden triumph at the 
1996 Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	But the world changed for the 22-year-old Californian last  
September when she broke through finally, delivering on all her 
promise, and captured the U.S. Open in New York. That helped 
catapult her to the No. 1 ranking a month later -- the first time an 
American-born woman held that spot since Chris Evert in 1985. At 
year's end, Davenport was still No. 1, and the victory in Sydney 
solidified that spot. 
</P>
<P>
	With those credentials, Davenport doesn't have to fear anyone.  
She knows it, and her opponents know it. Once, Graf would have had 
her beat before the coin toss, or at least the first time Davenport 
ran into trouble during the match. Now, Graf knows that Davenport 
is capable of playing tough tennis under pressure, finding ways to 
win, getting to balls that used to skip past her, and enduring even 
a long three-setter. 
</P>
<P>
	When they played last week in Sydney, it was Graf who was  
breathing hard, and Davenport who kept pummeling winners in a 
straight-sets victory. 
</P>
<P>
	Davenport's first match in the Australian Open, against No. 25  
Gala Leon Garcia of Spain, will give an indication of how ready she 
is to win her second grand slam title. With only a day's rest 
following the Sydney tournament, Davenport wants to avoid long 
early matches in the Australian that can take their toll later on. 
</P>
<P>
	Reigning Wimbledon champion and No. 3 seed Jana Novotna also is  
in action on Day 1, as are No. 5 Venus Williams and unseeded 
Jennifer Capriati. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the top men, No. 2 seed Alex Corretja of Spain opens play  
in the stadium against Japan's Takao Suzuki, and U.S. Open champ 
and No. 3 seed Patrick Rafter of Australia plays Germany's Oliver 
Gross. 
</P>
<P>
	Defending champion Petr Korda gets the day off, though he  
remains the center of a drug controversy. On Sunday, the ATP 
Players Council voted to increase the first-time penalty for 
certain classes of drugs, including anabolic steroids, from one 
year to two years. 
</P>
<P>
	Korda, who tested positive for the steroid nandrolone after  
Wimbledon last year, avoided even a one-year suspension when an 
appeals panel agreed with him that there had been ``exceptional 
circumstances'' in his case. 
</P>
<P>
	Many players have criticized that decision, saying they don't  
know what the circumstances were, and look to another appeal of the 
case by the International Tennis Federation to the Committee for 
Arbitration in Sports in Switzerland to settle the issue.

<HEADLINE> NCAA OKs Aluminum Bat Rules </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- Some restrictions on aluminum bats  
designed to make them more ``wood-like'' will take effect for this 
summer's college baseball championships, the NCAA announced Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	But the NCAA Executive Committee decided more testing was needed  
before it could try to limit the speed at which the ball flies off 
the bat -- the so-called ``exit speed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The restrictions are aimed at protecting pitchers and infielders  
as well as cutting back on the offense. 
</P>
<P>
	New rules specifying bat thickness and the ratio between the  
length and weight of the bat will be in effect in all three NCAA 
divisions for the 1999 championships. 
</P>
<P>
	The restrictions ``retard the performance of the non-wood  
bats,'' said Charles T. Wethington, chairman of the Executive 
Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Those restrictions, along with an exit speed of 93 mph, had been  
scheduled to take effect for the 2000 regular season. Exit speeds 
from some aluminum bats reach 113 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	The NCAA has wrestled with the issue since last summer when  
Southern California defeated Arizona State 21-14 in the College 
World Series championship game -- a game that lasted four hours as 
the teams combined for nine home runs and 39 hits. 
</P>
<P>
	A record 62 home runs were hit in the College World Series,  
compared with the previous record of 48 set two years earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	The NCAA considered the safety of pitchers and infielders in the  
face of fast-flying batted balls as well as restoring a balance 
between offense and defense. 
</P>
<P>
	Some preliminary studies have shown that a pitcher -- caught  
off-balance with his weight moving toward the plate after throwing 
-- does not have time to react to a ball hit directly at him off an 
aluminum bat. 
</P>
<P>
	NCAA president Cedric Dempsey said, however, that there has not  
been a significant increase in the number of injuries over the past 
decade. 
</P>
<P>
	One bat manufacturer has filed suit against the NCAA because of  
the restrictions, alleging illegal restraint of trade. Eastman 
Sports of Van Nuys, Calif., seeks $267 million in damages. 
</P>
<P>
	Easton is prepared to provide bats that comply with the new  
specifications for this season's baseball playoffs, Jim Easton, CEO 
of the company, said in a prepared statement Friday. He said 
coaches want to practice and play with the same bats their teams 
would use if they make the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	``However, Easton continues to believe that changes in bat  
specifications are unnecessary and anti-competitive,'' Easton said. 
</P>
<P>
	Dempsey said the lawsuit has not been resolved, although the two  
sides are in discussions. 
</P>
<P>
	The Executive Committee will create an independent panel to  
study the issues and report by July 1. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need to know that we have the most reliable information  
available for the Executive Committee so that we can determine if 
any modifications to our rule for the 2000 season need to be 
made,'' Dempsey said. ``Frankly, we are learning more all the time 
about exit speeds, reaction times and the differences in so-called 
`sweet spots' between wood and non-wood bats.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dempsey left open the possibility that the restrictions could be  
modified as a result of the findings of the study panel.

<HEADLINE> Spousal Abuse in Military Examined </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The rate of spousal abuse in the U.S. military  
is significantly higher than the national average, and the military 
routinely fails to punish service members convicted of even extreme 
cases of domestic violence, ``60 Minutes'' reported Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The CBS television program reviewed Pentagon records from 1992  
through 1996 and found that 50,000 military spouses were victims of 
domestic violence, five times higher than the civilian population 
rate when compared to Department of Justice records for the same 
five years. Less than five percent of the accused were 
court-martialed, according to Pentagon statistics. 
</P>
<P>
	Secretary of Defense William Cohen declined to speak to ``60  
Minutes'' about the issue. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert Clark, the commanding general of Ft. Campbell, Ky., where  
several particularly violent incidents have occurred, said the 
military does a good job handling domestic violence cases. 
</P>
<P>
	In a written statement to the program, Clark said the U.S. Army  
has ``taken active measures to prevent, identify and intervene at 
the earliest known occurrence of domestic violence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Peter MacDonald, chief district court judge in Kentucky with  
jurisdiction over Ft. Campbell, said the Army routinely ignores his 
court orders designed to protect abused spouses. ``They have no 
conception of what's going on in domestic violence,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	In one case, MacDonald issued an emergency protective order  
requiring Sgt. Bill Coffin to stay away from Ronnie Spence, his 
ex-fiance. Coffin violated the order and fatally shot Spence. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're not taking this seriously,'' MacDonald said. ``And if  
they can't take my order seriously, how can they take the issue of 
domestic violence seriously?'' 
</P>
<P>
	In another case, U.S. Navy Chief Petty Officer Lance LaFrancis,  
stationed in Groton, Conn., violated several orders of protection 
and eventually pleaded guilty to five counts of domestic assault. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Brazil Devaluation Shakes Stability </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) -- Brazil's market-shaking devaluation of  
its currency last week shattered what was once considered an 
untouchable cornerstone of its economic stabilization program: the 
Real Plan. 
</P>
<P>
	Ever since the plan was introduced in July 1994, a strong and  
artificially overvalued currency -- the real -- helped to keep the 
lid on inflation, long the scourge of Brazil's economy. 
</P>
<P>
	With a strong currency, foreign goods flooded the market,  
pushing local prices down. High interest rates also helped bring 
inflation down by keeping demand down. Annual inflation rates of 
close to 3,000 percent fell to about 2 percent in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	But the plan's nasty side effects, including unemployment,  
recession and growing trade deficits, created an unlikely alliance 
of businessmen, trade union leaders, politicians and even clergy 
who called for a complete revamping of the country's economic 
policies. 
</P>
<P>
	And apparently that is what began last week, when Brazil  
temporarily stopped defending the real, and let it trade openly on 
foreign exchange markets. 
</P>
<P>
	``No matter how you look at it, the Plano Real as originally  
conceived is no longer the same,'' said Marcio Pochmann, an 
economist at the University of Campinas. ``It will no longer be 
sustained by the unsustainable, an overvalued currency.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, Brazil announced it would not dip into its cash  
reserves to prop up its beleaguered currency -- if only for one day. 
The real plunged as low as 1.60 to the dollar before strengthening 
slightly to 1.43 at the close of trading. That was down from 1.32 
at the close of trading Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The move came just two days after the Central Bank tried a  
smaller devaluation of 8 percent by extending the band in which the 
currency could trade to between 1.20 reals and 1.32 reals to the 
dollar. 
</P>
<P>
	The Central Bank is expected to say on Monday whether the real  
will continue being traded freely or be placed back into a band 
system. 
</P>
<P>
	Fiscal adjustment was always part of the Real Plan, but its  
approval was delayed for years by a cantankerous Congress and a 
distracted executive branch. 
</P>
<P>
	Finally, in late October, with Brazil engulfed by the global  
financial crisis, the government unveiled a mix of taxes and 
spending cuts in a bid to save nearly $24 billion in 1999 and about 
$80 billion by 2002. The Fiscal Stability Plan was the basis of a 
$41.5 billion international aid package announced by the 
International Monetary Fund on Nov. 13. 
</P>
<P>
	Congress still must vote on the four remaining, and more  
controversial, items of the fiscal adjustment plan, expected to 
take place this week.

<HEADLINE> Teen Tried in Classmate's Death </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEARFIELD, Pa. (AP) -- She was a 15-year-old doing what all  
teens do: trying hard to fit in. 
</P>
<P>
	The afternoon of May 10, Kimberly Jo Dotts found herself in the  
woods with a knot of kids she barely knew who were planning to run 
away to Florida that night. 
</P>
<P>
	But as suddenly as she'd met them, they turned on her. Someone  
complained that Kimberly -- short, overweight and learning-disabled 
-- might ``snitch'' on them, and teen-age cruelty grew deadly. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors say a noose was pulled over Kimberly's head, the  
other end slung over a maple branch; then two teens, Jessica 
Holtmeyer, 16, and Aaron Straw, 19, yanked on the rope with all 
their strength. 
</P>
<P>
	Kimberly's body shook and convulsed, then went limp. On the  
ground, as she gasped for breath, the prosecutors say, Jessica 
smashed her face with a rock the size of a basketball. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was fun to hang someone,'' one of her friends quoted her  
saying after they covered Kimberly's body with branches and leaves. 
``It would be fun to do that again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Seven people were there -- some standing around, some egging  
others on, some helping with the lynching or hiding the body -- but 
Jessica will be the first to be tried for murder. Straw awaits 
trial, and the five others pleaded guilty to lesser charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Jury selection for Jessica begins Monday in Bloomsburg, 105  
miles to the east because of heavy news coverage here. Opening 
arguments are scheduled for Jan. 25. Prosecutors say they will ask 
for the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
	The crime, and the arrest of seven locals aged 14 to 24, has  
shaken Clearfield, a working-class coal and lumber town of 7,500 
that lies about 125 miles northeast of Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
	Testimony and police affidavits reveal some of what apparently  
happened: 
</P>
<P>
	Kimberly's search for friends put her with a group of kids who  
had hung out together just long enough to give themselves a name: 
the Runaway Gang. Her introduction came from a schoolmate, 
14-year-old Dawn Lanager, who'd asked Kimberly to sleep over May 8, 
a Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dottses had encouraged their daughter to reach out socially,  
and they could hear the excitement in her voice when she told them 
of the invitation. 
</P>
<P>
	The next day, Kimberly returned home briefly and, leaving,  
ordered her 7-year-old sister not to follow. ``I'm running away,'' 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
	But on Sunday, the group was still in Clearfield. They'd found a  
driver who would take them south, but he wasn't leaving until later 
that night. To pass the time, they hitchhiked up to Shiloh, 15 
minutes away, to break into hunting campers and look for money. 
</P>
<P>
	They also stole liquor -- and a rope.  
</P>
<P>
	The trouble seemed to begin when Tracy Lynn Lewis, 24, a distant  
cousin of Kimberly's, called the girl a snitch for getting her in 
trouble over a drinking party she'd given for a group of kids. 
Aloud, she worried her cousin might snitch again. 
</P>
<P>
	Talk turned to ``dumping'' Kimberly from their adventure.  
</P>
<P>
	But no one seemed to take the talk as seriously as Jessica, and  
schoolmates said that wasn't surprising. Jessica was known as a 
bully at school, and people told stories of her setting cats on 
fire and strangling a poodle. She'd told her friends earlier that 
day that she didn't like Kimberly, but nobody seemed to know why -- 
they had never met before. 
</P>
<P>
	The group ended up at a clearing in Shiloh known as Gallows  
Harbor for a 19th century hanging. 
</P>
<P>
	Jessica said she wanted to test Kimberly's loyalty to the group.  
A noose was fashioned from the stolen rope. Jessica and Ms. Lewis 
looped it around Kimberly's neck, and Jessica dragged her around 
like a dog until one of the teens stopped her. 
</P>
<P>
	Then Straw grabbed the rope and tossed the noose over a branch.  
An initiation began. 
</P>
<P>
	One by one, three teens briefly put the noose over their heads.  
Then it was Kimberly's turn. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yank it!'' Ms. Lewis screamed.  
</P>
<P>
	Jessica and Straw lifted the 5-foot-1, 165-pound Kimberly off  
the ground long enough for her to go into convulsions, but they 
dropped her, hearing trucks nearby. 
</P>
<P>
	At that point, Ms. Lewis and three of the teens walked away.  
</P>
<P>
	But three others lingered, and again, the noose was tightened.  
Jessica and Straw pulled again, this time until Kimberly became 
colorless and limp. When her body dropped to the dirt, Jessica 
dropped the rock on her head. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's what happens to snitches,'' she was quoted as saying.  
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't mean for Kim to get hurt, just to scare her,'' Straw  
told police. ``But Jessie would not listen to anybody and she had 
to kill her because she didn't like her.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Six in the group headed for Lakeland, Fla., that night. Jessica  
decided to stay home. Searchers looking for the missing Kimberly 
found the body nine days later, and state police questioned Jessica 
just hours afterward. 
</P>
<P>
	She nodded when asked if she was involved. While smoking a  
cigarette outside a few minutes later, she told a trooper, ``When I 
get nervous and excited, I black out and people tell me things I 
did. I'll probably spend the rest of my life in jail.'' 
</P>
<P>
	State police arrested Jessica minutes later.

<HEADLINE> Sydney Olympic Panel Vows Honesty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- Sydney's Olympic organizing committee  
reassured corporate sponsors worried about corruption in the 
Olympic movement that its winning bid for the 2000 Summer Games was 
free of bribery. 
</P>
<P>
	No one ``should have reason to believe that Sydney has cause to  
be embarrassed about the integrity of its bid,'' Sandy Hollway, the 
spokesman for the Sydney Organizing Committee for the Olympic 
Games, said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	His statement follows a weekend of disclosures about corruption  
allegations involving the Salt Lake City and Nagano winter 
Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	``No allegations have been made about Sydney's conduct and I am  
comforted by the public assurances of people central to the bid 
that all actions were proper,'' Hollway said in a public letter to 
Olympic sponsors. 
</P>
<P>
	Hollway said SOCOG supports the International Olympic  
Committee's investigation into the allegations, and also advocates 
reform of the bidding process, which has been proposed by the IOC. 
</P>
<P>
	Caltex, a joint venture of the U.S. oil companies Texaco and  
Chevron, ended talks last week about becoming a sponsor of the 2000 
Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	After 12 months of negotiations, Caltex withdrew from an  
arrangement that would have set up a $6.3 million sponsorship deal, 
saying it had already signed up as a sponsor of the U.S. Olympic 
team and partner for the 2002 Salt Lake City Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	Faced with a $200 million shortfall in anticipated sponsorship,  
New South Wales state Olympics Minister Michael Knight said last 
week he expects swift action to assure prospective sponsors that 
the games will not be further tarnished. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think it's a problem yet (with sponsors), but it could  
become a problem,'' Knight said in an interview with The Associated 
Press. ``If the (Olympic) brand continues to be sullied, then 
obviously that will impact on future sponsorship opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's very important that the IOC move quickly to expel  
members, if any members are proved to have taken bribes, and that 
they move quickly to put some confidence back into the bidding 
process.''

<HEADLINE> Brazil Holds Meeting With U.S., IMF </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Brazilian authorities met Sunday with U.S.  
officials and the International Monetary Fund, seeking ways to keep 
Latin America's largest economy from succumbing to an Asian-style 
currency crisis that could drag down other countries in the region. 
</P>
<P>
	Private economists warned that investor sentiment could sour  
quickly unless Brazil moves much more forcefully to address 
underlying problems, including the government's huge budget 
deficit. 
</P>
<P>
	Brazil was scheduled to provide details of its new currency  
regime early Monday before markets open. Brazilian Finance Minister 
Pedro Malan and central bank president Francisco Lopes held a 
series of meetings Saturday and Sunday with officials at the IMF 
and World Bank as well as the administration's point man for the 
global currency crisis, Deputy Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials described the talks as a wide-ranging review of steps  
Brazil already has taken and what needs to be done to calm investor 
unease. 
</P>
<P>
	Malan told reporters that Brazil may ask for early release of  
the next installment of the $41.5 billion rescue package that the 
IMF put together for Brazil in November. Brazil has received $9 
billion already, and a similar amount was scheduled to be released 
next month. 
</P>
<P>
	A Brazilian newspaper reported that Brazil was considering  
allowing the nation's currency, the real, to float freely against 
the dollar on a long-term basis, following the market's positive 
reaction to Friday's announcement that the government was 
abandoning temporarily its defense of the real. 
</P>
<P>
	Financial markets around the world staged big gains on the news  
as investors demonstrated relief that the government of President 
Fernando Henrique Cardoso would no longer be wasting the country's 
dwindling foreign reserves to prop up the currency. 
</P>
<P>
	But analysts warned that during the 18 months of the current  
economic crisis, which began in Thailand on July 2, 1997, markets 
often have staged brief rallies on news that countries are giving 
up defense of their currencies only to plunge in later days as 
pessimism returns about a country's overall economic prospects. 
</P>
<P>
	``You won't have anything like the possibility of lasting  
stability until you see a lot more in terms of reforms on the part 
of Brazil,'' said C. Fred Bergsten, a Treasury official in the 
Carter administration and now head of the Institute of 
International Economics, a Washington think tank. 
</P>
<P>
	``If Brazil fails to do the things it needs to restore  
confidence, then you could have quite a bout of new contagion,'' 
Bergsten said. ``It could spill over into the rest of Latin 
America, most notably Argentina, and countries outside the region 
as well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bergsten said that Argentina, Hong Kong and China are most at  
risk from further market instability because they are all still 
trying to maintain fixed exchange rates with the dollar, rather 
than the more prevalent practice of allowing a nation's currency to 
be traded freely with the price set by what buyers are willing to 
pay. 
</P>
<P>
	Countries maintaining fixed exchange rates reap benefits in  
billions of dollars pouring in from foreign investors who have no 
fear that their holdings will be wiped out suddenly by a currency 
depreciation. But as experience has shown, such investment can flow 
out just as quickly when investor sentiment turns and worries 
intensify that countries will be forced to give up fixed-rate 
currency regimes. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration persuaded the IMF to put together a  
pre-emptive $41.5 billion credit line for Brazil, hoping that 
amount along with Brazil's own reserves would be enough to convince 
foreign investors that Brazil would not have to devalue. 
</P>
<P>
	Carodoso's government was unable to win approval in Brazil's  
Congress of budget cuts and tax increases needed to shrink the 
government deficit, however, which caused investors to grow nervous 
and begin another rush for the exits. 
</P>
<P>
	Those developments last week shattered what had been a two-month  
period of relative calm in global markets after the U.S. Federal 
Reserve rode to the rescue last fall with a series of three 
interest rate cuts to avert calamity. 
</P>
<P>
	``The only option Brazil had was to devalue and hope it goes in  
an orderly manner and doesn't spin out of control,'' said Sung Won 
Sohn, chief economist at Wells Fargo in Minneapolis. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the initial signs were encouraging, given that Brazil  
goes into the crisis with larger reserves than other nations that 
have gotten into trouble and a better track record under Cardoso of 
managing its economy.

<HEADLINE> More Hockey Players Hurt in Tourneys </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- When the stakes go up, injuries do, too. A  
study finds that young ice hockey players get many more injuries -- 
a large proportion of them concussions -- during tournaments. 
</P>
<P>
	The study compared injury rates in Minnesota tournament play to  
rates in two previous season-long studies of regular play. Injuries 
were four to six times more likely in tournaments, and 15 percent 
of them were concussions, researchers found. 
</P>
<P>
	Hard checking is apparently a big reason why, according to  
researcher William O. Roberts of MinnHealth Sports Care, White Bear 
Lake, Minn. He called for a ban on intentional contact at play 
below the college level. A spokesman for amateur hockey's U.S. 
governing body disagreed. 
</P>
<P>
	``Intentional contact increases the risk of injury,'' Dr.  
Roberts said. ``I'm encouraged that most of the injuries were small 
and minor, but we had nine concussions in that group, and that 
seems high to me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Roberts and his colleagues looked at four boys' and one girls'  
tournaments in the 1993-94 season. The results were published in 
the American College of Sports Medicine journal, Medicine and 
Science in Sports and Exercise. 
</P>
<P>
	Trainers tracking injuries found 60 among the 695 boys and four  
among the 112 girls, all ages 11-19. An injury was recorded if it 
stopped play, or if the player requested evaluation, but play did 
not stop. 
</P>
<P>
	An injury was considered significant if it kept the player off  
the ice for at least the next day; a concussion was significant if 
the player had to take time off the ice before returning to play. 
Twenty-six boys had significant injuries; one concussion was severe 
enough to cause a few seconds of unconsciousness, the study 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
	``In boys' games, 65 percent of `all' injuries and 77 percent of  
`significant' injuries were related to collisions,'' the study 
said. ``The girls' rules of play do not allow body checking, and 
there were no significant injuries in the girls' games.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The injury rates are well above what Roberts had noted in  
previous research in Minnesota regular play. It's possible that 
kids were more intense in tournaments, or more tired from a tighter 
schedule of games and living away from home, the paper said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Kids playing hockey are bigger, faster, stronger and more  
skilled ... and they hit harder,'' Roberts said. ``The equipment's 
good, but it's not that good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	To reduce the injuries, boys' ice hockey should follow the  
no-deliberate-contact rule of the girls, Roberts said. ``I have 
daughters, and I'm kind of glad I don't have to deal with the 
issue,'' he said. ``The game's fine without it, in my opinion. 
There's enough incidental contact to satisfy most people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I think that's a super idea,'' commented Dr. Charles Tator,  
chairman of neurosurgery at the University of Toronto. ``I think 
that would help the game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Youth hockey has become too aggressive, Tator said. ``There is a  
degree of aggressiveness that mimics what is present in the NHL,'' 
he said. ``The NHL, of course, is a terrible role model for young 
people because they allow fighting.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If anything, the concussion rate cited in the Minnesota study  
may be low, said Tator, president of the Canadian branch of Think 
First, a North American group that seeks to prevent head and spinal 
injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	``Fifteen percent doesn't sound like a lot to me,'' Tator said.  
``Head injuries are frequent in hockey and, unfortunately, they get 
more frequent as the players get older. These players are skating 
faster, and they weigh more.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Another physician who tracks skating injuries, Tom Pashby of  
Toronto, offered other explanations. Concussions may occur because 
the helmets are attached too loosely, so they come off at impact, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Teaching safer play, not banning checking, is what's necessary,  
responded a spokesman for USA Hockey, Darryl Seibel. ``Banning 
checking, our research has shown, is not really the answer to 
eliminating injuries,'' he said. ``The conclusion is that body 
checking in and of itself does not necessarily present a danger at 
the youth level.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The organization has its own program to teach safer hockey,  
Seibel said. It wants kids to learn such things as never to check 
from behind and how to absorb the impact of a collision, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	And despite what some people may think, hockey is not that  
dangerous, Seibel said. ``There really is not an inordinate injury 
rate, especially compared with other youth sports,'' he said. 
``There are many studies showing there are fewer injuries in youth 
hockey than in other sports.''

<HEADLINE> Car Explodes Near Embassy in Moscow </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- A car parked next to the U.S. Embassy in Moscow  
exploded Sunday morning, but the blast was accidental and there 
were no reports of injuries or damage to the embassy. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokesman for the Federal Security Service said the explosion  
was an accident, and not a bomb or a terrorist act. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the Interfax news agency, a propane gas canister in  
the car exploded. The ITAR-Tass news agency said a fuel leak caused 
the blast. 
</P>
<P>
	As a precaution, embassy security officials examined other cars  
parked near the building, but no explosives were found. 
</P>
<P>
	There was no apparent damage to the embassy building. The blast  
broke several windows in an adjacent apartment building. 
</P>
<P>
	Interfax said the car belonged to a Russian police officer  
assigned to guard the embassy. 
</P>
<P>
	Embassy spokesman Michael Hurley said workers inside the embassy  
had heard a ``loud bang'' outside. He said no one inside was 
injured. 
</P>
<P>
	Anti-American sentiments have been growing in Russia following  
the bombing raids on Iraq and the imposition of sanctions on 
Russian institutes for allegedly helping Iran to build weapons of 
mass destruction. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1995, the embassy was hit by a rocket-propelled grenade fired  
from across the street. The grenade pierced the wall of the 
building and exploded in an empty office. No one was injured.

<HEADLINE>  Serb Forces Fire on Kosovo Village </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RACAK, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Fighting erupted Sunday near a Kosovo  
village where 45 ethnic Albanians were massacred earlier, forcing 
mourners to halt funeral services for the slain and join 
international monitors in fleeing to safety. 
</P>
<P>
	Serb forces in southern Kosovo sealed off other villages in the  
area later Sunday. Peace verifiers from the Organization for 
Security and Cooperation in Europe reported houses burning in 
villages west of Racak, 15 miles south of the provincial capital, 
Pristina. 
</P>
<P>
	The renewed fighting flared as ambassadors of the 16 NATO  
members went into an emergency session at alliance headquarters in 
Brussels, Belgium, to decide on a strategy in response to the 
massacre of the ethnic Albanians, whose mutilated bodies were 
discovered Saturday in a gully. 
</P>
<P>
	The ambassadors were considering options including sending  
generals to Belgrade with one last warning for Yugoslav President 
Slobodan Milosevic. The threat of NATO airstrikes, hanging over the 
heads of Serb authorities since October, also remained an option. 
</P>
<P>
	Sunday's clashes added new urgency to international efforts to  
contain the crisis and prevent a complete collapse of the Oct. 12 
peace accord Milosevic accepted to end seven months of fighting in 
secessionist Kosovo, a province of Yugoslavia's main republic, 
Serbia. 
</P>
<P>
	In Washington, senior officials from the State Department and  
the Pentagon met for a second day to discuss strategy on Kosovo. 
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright discussed the situation by 
telephone with several allied foreign ministers. 
</P>
<P>
	An OSCE official, Mike Philips, said international monitors  
reported heavy artillery and machine-gun fire around Racak on 
Sunday. It was unclear, however, whether ethnic Albanians were 
resisting the Serbs or whether the gunfire was coming from the 
government side only. 
</P>
<P>
	Philips said Yugoslav tanks and armored personnel carriers were  
also moving into the area of Podujevo, 20 miles north of Pristina. 
There was no report of fighting there, but Philips said government 
forces were ``definitely in a position of intimidation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In another sign of increased tensions, Serbia's ultranationalist  
deputy premier, Vojislav Seselj, accused the United States and 
Britain of ``training'' the Kosovo Liberation Army rebels ``for 
fighting and propaganda.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The United States and Britain categorically denied the  
accusations. 
</P>
<P>
	Seselj's party also denounced the U.S. head of the international  
verification force, William Walker, as ``the patron of Albanian 
terrorist gangs.'' Walker has blamed Serb security forces for the 
massacre, which he called a crime against humanity. 
</P>
<P>
	Serb sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the  
fighting began Sunday when Serb forensic experts tried to enter 
Racak to investigate the massacre but came under fire from ethnic 
Albanian rebels. 
</P>
<P>
	British Gen. John Drewienkiewicz, deputy chief of the  
international peace verifiers, said the forensic experts insisted 
on entering the village under Serb police escort, despite the 
monitors' objections. 
</P>
<P>
	Ethnic Albanian rebels told verifiers they would allow the  
forensic experts into the village, but not the police. As the 
verifiers negotiated with the Serbs, automatic weapons and mortars 
began firing. 
</P>
<P>
	``I consider this to be a very provocative action by Yugoslav  
authorities,'' Drewienkiewicz said. ``I believe it has again broken 
the cease-fire.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Washington, State Department spokesman James P. Rubin  
condemned Sunday's violence in Racak, also calling Serb moves ``a 
provocation.'' He said any massacre investigation should be done by 
an international war crimes tribunal. 
</P>
<P>
	The chief prosecutor of the U.N. war crimes tribunal, Louise  
Arbour, planned to leave for Kosovo on Monday to investigate the 
massacre, whether or not Yugoslav authorities granted permission. 
</P>
<P>
	British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook told BBC radio Sunday that  
the killings were an atrocity and could not have been part of a 
battle. 
</P>
<P>
	Kosovo's moderate ethnic Albanian leader, Ibrahim Rugova,  
declared Sunday a day of mourning throughout the province. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier Sunday, the bodies of 40 victims were brought to the  
village mosque in Racak, where mourners laid them out under plastic 
sheets. Relatives sobbed and wailed ``My brother!'' ``My father!'' 
and ``Oh, God!'' 
</P>
<P>
	The fighting broke out before the bodies could be buried.  
</P>
<P>
	``We don't know when we'll have the funerals,'' said 16-year-old  
Vjollsa Jakupi, who fled with her family as shooting broke out 
anew. ``We want to, but we're too afraid.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Belgrade, Serb President Milan Milutonovic repeated police  
claims that the ethnic Albanians were rebels killed in combat, 
although the dead included three women, a 12-year-old boy and old 
men -- all in civilian clothes. Many had been shot at close range 
and some had been mutilated, with eyes gouged out and at least one 
was decapitated. 
</P>
<P>
	The KLA said the death toll from the massacre was 51, including  
nine of its fighters and a 3-month-old baby. The report could not 
be confirmed. Monitors put the death toll at 45.

<HEADLINE>  Serb Forces Fire on Kosovo Village </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RACAK, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Fighting erupted Sunday near a Kosovo  
village where 45 ethnic Albanians were massacred earlier, forcing 
mourners to halt funeral services for the slain and join 
international monitors in fleeing to safety. 
</P>
<P>
	Serb forces in southern Kosovo sealed off other villages in the  
area later Sunday. Peace verifiers from the Organization for 
Security and Cooperation in Europe reported houses burning in 
villages west of Racak, 15 miles south of the provincial capital, 
Pristina. 
</P>
<P>
	The renewed fighting flared as ambassadors of the 16 NATO  
members went into an emergency session at alliance headquarters in 
Brussels, Belgium, to decide on a strategy in response to the 
massacre of the ethnic Albanians, whose mutilated bodies were 
discovered Saturday in a gully. 
</P>
<P>
	The ambassadors were considering options including sending  
generals to Belgrade with one last warning for Yugoslav President 
Slobodan Milosevic. The threat of NATO airstrikes, hanging over the 
heads of Serb authorities since October, also remained an option. 
</P>
<P>
	Sunday's clashes added new urgency to international efforts to  
contain the crisis and prevent a complete collapse of the Oct. 12 
peace accord Milosevic accepted to end seven months of fighting in 
secessionist Kosovo, a province of Yugoslavia's main republic, 
Serbia. 
</P>
<P>
	In Washington, senior officials from the State Department and  
the Pentagon met for a second day to discuss strategy on Kosovo. 
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright discussed the situation by 
telephone with several allied foreign ministers. 
</P>
<P>
	An OSCE official, Mike Philips, said international monitors  
reported heavy artillery and machine-gun fire around Racak on 
Sunday. It was unclear, however, whether ethnic Albanians were 
resisting the Serbs or whether the gunfire was coming from the 
government side only. 
</P>
<P>
	Philips said Yugoslav tanks and armored personnel carriers were  
also moving into the area of Podujevo, 20 miles north of Pristina. 
There was no report of fighting there, but Philips said government 
forces were ``definitely in a position of intimidation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In another sign of increased tensions, Serbia's ultranationalist  
deputy premier, Vojislav Seselj, accused the United States and 
Britain of ``training'' the Kosovo Liberation Army rebels ``for 
fighting and propaganda.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The United States and Britain categorically denied the  
accusations. 
</P>
<P>
	Seselj's party also denounced the U.S. head of the international  
verification force, William Walker, as ``the patron of Albanian 
terrorist gangs.'' Walker has blamed Serb security forces for the 
massacre, which he called a crime against humanity.

<HEADLINE> Tough Road Awaits Unbeaten Huskies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) -- Connecticut has done little wrong this  
season: 
</P>
<P>
	Seven weeks at No. 1, one of only two unbeaten teams in Division  
I, just two of 15 wins by fewer than 13 points. 
</P>
<P>
	Talk of a perfect season, however, can really start the next  
three weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	``We look at a different side of the league now,'' Huskies coach  
Jim Calhoun said of the upcoming Big East opponents. ``That's not a 
caution note, it's an honesty note. I think we've been terrific and 
I've been happy with what we've done so far, but now we have 12 
more games to attack and we'll be facing teams that have had a 
little more success.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 7-0 start in the conference has been against the teams that  
were at the bottom of the league last season, although Pittsburgh 
did turn things around and was ranked this season. 
</P>
<P>
	Saturday's 81-58 victory over the Panthers (9-7, 1-5) was  
considered a payback for the 70-69 buzzer-beating win the Huskies 
had on Dec. 12. That and a 59-54 victory at Massachusetts in the 
U-Game were the only ones where Connecticut even had to break a 
sweat. 
</P>
<P>
	Next up is Wednesday's game at Miami -- where the Huskies have  
lost two straight seasons -- followed by a home game with Seton 
Hall, then road games with Georgetown and No. 11 St. John's, a home 
game with No. 18 Syracuse and a cross-country trip to No. 4 
Stanford. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would be really foolhardy (to downplay the start). I want  
them to feel good about what they've done,'' Calhoun said. ``But 
we're stepping up against teams closer to us, maybe better than us 
because we haven't played those teams and some are on the road. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to some environments that have been difficult and  
we have to prepare for that. Last time we did that we came out with 
a one-point win so I'll be going back to the Pittsburgh game in a 
different way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Connecticut has five starters back from a team that reached the  
final eight of the NCAA tournament last season. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a confidence building that's almost unnerving for a  
coach,'' Calhoun said. 
</P>
<P>
	After Saturday's win, the locker room at the Hartford Civic  
Center was full of one-liners and good-natured ribbing. 
</P>
<P>
	Jake Voskuhl, the center known for rebounding and defense, had  
14 points and 12 rebounds. He was being called ``Magic'' for a 
couple of outstanding passes. 
</P>
<P>
	Richard Hamilton, the reigning Big East player of the year and a  
preseason All-America, was laughing even after scoring a season-low 
five points on 2-of-8 shooting after averaging almost 33 points 
over his last three games. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a new image for me,'' he said of his team-high five  
assists. ``Really, I didn't get down on myself. I didn't force 
shots that weren't there and I did the other things that were, like 
passing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Huskies got a big lift from their bench. Albert Mouring had  
a career-high 18 points and was 3-for-5 on 3-pointers, while Edmund 
Saunders had 14 points and five rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
	When asked about Mouring's performance, Khalid El-Amin, the  
team's point guard, catalyst and comedian, looked right into a 
television camera and said: ``That's why we pay him the big 
bucks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Calhoun brought in former players Ray Allen and Kevin Ollie to  
scrimmage against the team during the NBA lockout and that helped 
the guards. The big men, however, may be where the Huskies' future 
success lies. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you go down the middle of the lane against Connecticut  
(forward) Kevin (Freeman), now Edmund and particularly Jake Voskuhl 
are there waiting for you,'' Calhoun said. ``He'll get some fouls 
that way but I've never had support defense like that. If you want 
to get to the rim against us you have to go through him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	El-Amin, as usual, didn't seem worried about the big stretch of  
games coming up. 
</P>
<P>
	``The character of this team is balanced and so is the  
scoring,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Strike Called at Tenn. Trane Plant </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLARKSVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Union workers at the Trane Co. plant  
manned the picket lines Sunday after rejecting a contract offer. 
</P>
<P>
	The union, which represents 1,800 workers, voted 1,012-307  
Saturday to strike. The workers' contract expired at midnight on 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Negotiations had been under way for nearly two months at the  
commercial air conditioner plant. Union officials said members 
worried about pensions and in-house hiring and were concerned that 
the contract offered was for four years instead of the usual three 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we were somewhat surprised with how (the union)  
reacted to the proposal,'' said Rickey Wallace, business 
representative for Machinists Union 1296. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's always hard to say with these issues. ... The members are  
aware that Trane is doing very well and I think expectations were 
high,'' Wallace told The Leaf-Chronicle in Clarksville. 
</P>
<P>
	A sticking point for the union was how the company fills  
openings. Trane keeps a pool of employees on stand-by to fill 
vacancies, but union members want a guarantee that employees 
working in the department with an opening get top priority. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're disappointed. We're hopeful that we can turn this thing  
around and get this settled,'' said Mel Van Hooser, human resources 
team leader for the company. 
</P>
<P>
	This is the seventh strike at Trane since the plant opened in  
1958. 
</P>
<P>
	Trane, a division of Piscataway, N.J.-based American Standard,  
has about 2,300 employees and an annual payroll of $50 million. The 
company had $3 billion in sales in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Union leaders met briefly with management after the vote but  
said no new negotiations were planned. They said they would wait 
for management to present a new proposal.

<HEADLINE> Zoo Program Creates Penguin Colony </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- The African penguins at the Baltimore Zoo look  
like proper, upstanding penguins, but looks can be deceiving. What 
they know about sexual trickery could teach soap opera stars a 
thing or two. 
</P>
<P>
	Take, for example, the adult female who has been reduced to  
hanging out with the youngsters in the nursery instead of the other 
adults snuggled up to each other in the nesting room. 
</P>
<P>
	``She's a bit of a home wrecker,'' said Steven J. Sarro, curator  
of birds, pointing out the pretty black and white penguin taking a 
twirl around the kiddie pool. ``We have two out there that are 
nesting and she likes one of them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Baltimore Zoo's African penguins breeding program has  
resulted in the largest and most prolific colony of African 
penguins in North America. Since the zoo began breeding in 1967, 
almost 800 African penguins, also known as black-footed penguins 
and the Jackass Penguin because they bray like donkeys, have been 
produced. The zoo sells many of them to other zoos and aquariums to 
pay for the breeding program. 
</P>
<P>
	The African penguin, distinguished by a black band across the  
upper chest, is one of 17 species, stands 18 inches tall and weighs 
about eight pounds. 
</P>
<P>
	They used to live by the millions on the coastal islands of  
South Africa, but now only about 140,000 exist, in large part 
because of oil spills and overharvesting of fish the penguins rely 
on as a food source, Sarro said. 
</P>
<P>
	Unless conditions change, African penguins could be extinct in  
the wild in 40 years, said Sarro, who traveled to South Africa last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	He told of visiting an island where 9,000 penguins once lived.  
</P>
<P>
	``We saw two,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Three years ago, the American Zoo and Aquarium Association  
selected the Baltimore Zoo to establish a species survival plan for 
the North American population of African penguins. The goal of the 
program is to produce a stable, genetically diverse population that 
can be acquired by zoos and aquariums worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
	The plan's propagation group, which Sarro leads, includes a  
geneticist, nutritionist and behaviorist, as well as members of 
other zoos who meet regularly to share information. 
</P>
<P>
	The black-footed penguin was first mentioned in the journals of  
explorer Alvero Vello in 1497. He wrote, ``These are birds as big 
as ducks, but they cannot fly because they have no feathers on 
their wings. These birds ... bray like asses.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Black-footed penguins became known as African penguins after  
1758. The species, one of several that live in temperate climates, 
is listed as vulnerable, but as late as 1967 penguin eggs were 
served as a delicacy in South African restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
	The zoo's 66 African penguins live in three rooms at the end of  
a long, underground tunnel. One room contains 16 plastic dog crates 
that line the walls and are used as nesting boxes. Couples have 
taken up occupancy in some of the boxes. 
</P>
<P>
	``Normally, they are monogamous their whole lives,'' Sarro said.  
However, there are exceptions. 
</P>
<P>
	`It is like a soup opera down here, I swear,'' said Sharon  
Overholser, the zoo's senior keeper of birds who keeps track of 666 
African penguins in the studbook, a registry of birds at 55 zoos 
and aquariums. ``We used to have a female that went around breaking 
up all the other pairs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nearly 70 percent of the penguins in the studbook at zoos and  
aquariums in the United States and Canada can be traced to the 
Baltimore Zoo's penguins. 
</P>
<P>
	Members of the propagation group select pairs that are  
genetically valuable for breeding and guard against inbreeding. In 
some cases, they will pair penguins that don't have a natural 
attraction for each other because they are a good genetic match. 
</P>
<P>
	Because male and female penguins are virtually identical, it  
frequently takes blood tests to determine their sex. 
</P>
<P>
	African penguins take weeks, even months before they mate while  
the couple gets to know each other. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is just like dating,'' Sarro said.  
</P>
<P>
	The female will lay two eggs about four days apart, the second  
as insurance. It takes 38 days for the eggs to hatch. 
</P>
<P>
	In the wild, both parents would care and feed the young, but  
that isn't prudent at the zoo because it places the young at risk 
of being picked on by other penguins. 
</P>
<P>
	So the chicks are taken from their parents at three weeks and  
placed in age-specific boxes in the nursery next to the kiddie pool 
where they will be forced to learn to swim at about two months, 
after their down has turned to feathers. 
</P>
<P>
	``They get swimming lessons. We toss them in and they learn to  
swim,'' Sarro said. ``They don't like it right away. They come 
around.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Between 12 and 16 weeks, the juveniles are introduced to the  
colony. 
</P>
<P>
	Sarro said each penguin has its own personality. One female  
hates squid until a day or two before she's be ready to lay eggs, 
and then that's all she wants. A male, named Jack, has a habit of 
pecking at shoes and pulling at coat hems. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm crazy about them,'' Sarro said. ``They just mess with  
you.''

<HEADLINE> Rocket Scientist Behind Water Gun </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SMYRNA, Ga. (AP) -- On Lonnie Johnson's office wall, right next  
to his patents for a thermostat, hair-drying rollers and a wet 
diaper detector, is patent No. 4,757,946 -- for the flow actuated 
pulsator. 
</P>
<P>
	The Super Soaker, as it's known to millions, is a little more  
advanced than your typical water gun. This high-powered weapon has 
drenched many backyard warriors and revitalized the toy gun market. 
</P>
<P>
	And unlike his work in the design of three NASA space probes  
that earned him a plaque, this homemade gadget turned the rocket 
scientist into a millionaire. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously, it was a cut above anything that was available but  
I never expected it would set the standard worldwide in water 
guns,'' said Johnson, 49, sitting in his suburban Atlanta research 
and development office. 
</P>
<P>
	A native of Mobile, Ala., Johnson's career had its start in 1968  
when he won a state science fair competition with Linex, a 
remote-controlled robot he built using batteries, compressed air 
and tape reels. 
</P>
<P>
	``Back then robots were unheard of so I was one of only a few  
kids in the country who had his own robot,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Not bad for a black kid who was told while growing up in the  
South that he didn't have what it took to be an engineer. Although 
disheartened, Johnson persevered, earning a bachelor's degree in 
mechanical engineering and a master's in nuclear engineering. He 
holds wide-ranging patents -- 49 in all -- and is working on an 
additional dozen or so. 
</P>
<P>
	As an engineer at the National Aeronautics and Space  
Administration's acclaimed Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, 
Calif., Johnson worked on Voyager, Mars Observer, and Galileo. 
</P>
<P>
	``I came up with the idea of a memory keeper power supply that  
would operate even if there was a short circuit aboard the 
spacecraft,'' he said of his work on Galileo, which was launched in 
1989. 
</P>
<P>
	At the time of his most lucrative stroke of creative genius, in  
1982, Johnson was an engineer at the Strategic Air Command in 
Omaha, Neb., working in his spare time on a new type of heat pump 
that would use water instead of Freon. 
</P>
<P>
	He hooked up a model of the pump to the bathroom sink in his  
home. 
</P>
<P>
	``I turned around and I was shooting this thing across the  
bathroom into the tub and the stream of water was so powerful that 
the curtains were swirling in the breeze it sent out,'' he said. 
``I thought, `This would make a great water gun.''' 
</P>
<P>
	The Pneumatic Water Gun was what he dubbed the first prototype.  
He received the patent -- No. 4,591,071 -- for the squirt gun in 
1986, but he decided not to manufacture the plastic gun himself 
after determining it would cost $200 per gun for the first 1,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Then in 1989, he met some executives with Larami Corp. at a toy  
fair. Two weeks later, he was sitting in the company's conference 
room with a model of the Super Soaker he had created out of a 
plastic Coke bottle, PVC pipe and Plexiglas. 
</P>
<P>
	``I pumped it up and fired it across the conference room,'' he  
recalled. ``Wow,'' was the reaction from the suited executives. 
``From that point it was a done deal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Super Soaker, for which Johnson received a patent in 1988,  
was introduced into the market in 1990 with a pumped-up reservoir 
capable of firing a stream of water up to 50 feet. It blew away 
plain old water pistols. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, more than 250 million of the high-tech water weapons have  
been sold, according to Al Davis, Larami executive vice president. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's four guns to every kid in the United States,'' Davis  
said, noting that the plastic toys also found a surprise market 
among adults. 
</P>
<P>
	The giant water guns range the gamut from a $5 pocket-size  
version to the $50 CPS-3000, a gray, blue and red plastic weapon 
with a 2-gallon backpack guaranteed to soak its target. 
</P>
<P>
	The toy's success extend beyond the hot weather.  
</P>
<P>
	``It contributes to profits year-round,'' said Chris Byrne,  
editor of Playthings MarketWatch, a toy trade publication. ``It's 
mainly a spring and summer toy, but that doesn't mean in places 
like Florida and California kids aren't getting Super Soakers for 
Christmas.'' 
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Massive Freeway Pileup Near Detroit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Up to 50 cars and trucks smashed together in a  
massive freeway pileup Sunday morning that witnesses said was 
caused by black ice and fog. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are numerous injuries and lots of smashed-up cars,''  
said a police dispatcher in suburban Allen Park who would not be 
identified. 
</P>
<P>
	She could not say whether there were any fatalities, or the  
severity of the injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	Interstate 94 south of Detroit was shut down for several miles  
in both directions as tow trucks, and ambulance, police, and fire 
crews responded from several suburbs. 
</P>
<P>
	``It seemed like the road turned to ice,'' an unidentified  
injured man told WWJ-AM. 
</P>
<P>
	A woman told the station she was driving in light to medium fog  
when the traffic hit black ice. ``One car went up in the air and 
landed on the hood,'' said the unidentified woman, who escaped 
injury. ``Then all of a sudden, everybody started hitting each 
other.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A Dec. 31 chain-reaction accident on Interstate 75 about 180  
miles from Detroit killed one man and injured 41 others. That 
crash, with some wrecks piled three vehicles high and involving 114 
vehicles and 200 people, was blamed on whiteout conditions during 
heavy holiday traffic.

<HEADLINE> Senate Jurors Spar Over Witnesses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
                           *BY JIM ABRAMS   	
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Awaiting the White House defense, Senate  
jurors sparred Sunday over whether witnesses should testify at 
President Clinton's impeachment trial. Democrats pledged to call 
their own witnesses, including Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr 
and informant Linda Tripp, if the Republicans press forward. 
</P>
<P>
	``It will be a spectacle. It will go on and on, '' Sen. Paul  
Wellstone, D-Minn., said. 
</P>
<P>
	The trial resumes Tuesday, a few hours before Clinton is to  
deliver the State of the Union address to Congress, with White 
House lawyers defending the president and saying that even if he 
did lie about his relationship with Monica Lewinsky, the offense is 
not grave enough to be removed from office. 
</P>
<P>
	White House lawyers met Sunday to work on the president's  
defense. Clinton, meanwhile, spent the day preparing for his 
speech. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will make the case that the allegations are not supported  
by the facts or by the law, and they do not warrant nullifying the 
results of a national election and removing the president from 
office,'' White House spokesman Jim Kennedy said. 
</P>
<P>
	Following the White House presentation and a period for senators  
to ask questions, the Senate set aside time next week for votes on 
motions, including House managers' demands that they be allowed to 
call witnesses and an expected Democratic push for dismissal. 
</P>
<P>
	Nearly one-fifth of the Senate -- 19 senators in all -- appeared  
on Sunday talk shows. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the witness debate, partisan lines also were  
drawn on the legitimacy of the case against Clinton, with 
Republicans saying House prosecutors last week presented convincing 
evidence that the president committed perjury and obstruction of 
justice. Democrats said they'd heard nothing worthy of conviction 
and again pushed the option of censure. 
</P>
<P>
	The House prosecutors mentioned Ms. Lewinsky, White House  
secretary Betty Currie and Clinton confidant Vernon Jordan as 
likely witnesses. Democrats say the summoning of witnesses could 
snowball and drag out the trial for months. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is not an exaggeration: If you go that route, ... we may be  
talking May or June before we finish this trial,'' Sen. Christopher 
Dodd, D-Conn., said on NBC's ``Meet the Press.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The White House's Kennedy said Starr had questioned at least 100  
witnesses over eight months and ``the notion that even more 
witnesses are needed shows how weak the case is.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats made clear they would contribute to expanding the  
witness list. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd be very interested in maybe having Linda Tripp, maybe  
having a whole host of people, ... and Ken Starr, all of whom might 
shed enormous light as to how it is we got here,'' said Sen. John 
Kerry, D-Mass. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I am any reader of the tea leaves, front and center is  
going to be Kenneth Starr, and we will go through prosecutorial 
abuse,'' Sen. Robert Torricelli, D-N.J., said on CBS' ``Face the 
Nation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans pointed out that a majority vote will be required  
for accepting each witness. ``We are not going to let this spin out 
of control,'' Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said on CBS. 
</P>
<P>
	That Republicans would let the trial go on interminably, when  
the nation wants a quick conclusion ``assumes that we Republicans 
are singularly stupid,'' Sen. Bob Bennett, R-Utah, said on CNN's 
``Late Edition.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Torricelli made clear that the bipartisan spirit the Senate has  
maintained so far in the trial could disintegrate if House 
prosecutors are permitted to call witnesses but those called by the 
White House are rejected. 
</P>
<P>
	Several of the 13 House prosecutors stressed they have made no  
decision on what witnesses they would call. Witnesses are crucial, 
Rep. Asa Hutchinson, R-Ark., said on ABC's ``This Week,'' because 
``I don't think you could obtain a conviction or I could clearly 
ask for a conviction until we have testimony.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, said that in their three days of  
arguments House prosecutors ``presented a powerful case'' and the 
White House will have a heavy burden rebutting it. ``I don't think 
you can just sweep away the House's case. I think a lot of people 
were very impressed,'' he said on NBC. 
</P>
<P>
	But Wellstone, also on NBC, said ``the House has not made its  
case'' for conviction and ``there is nowhere close to 67 senators 
in my judgment who are going to vote to remove the president.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At least 12 Democrats would have to join the 55 Senate  
Republicans to get the two-thirds vote needed to convict. Of 10 
Democrats interviewed Sunday on the news programs, not one signaled 
more sympathy toward conviction after hearing the House arguments. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've sat for three days and haven't heard anything new. I  
don't think we'll hear anything new when the White House makes a 
presentation,'' Sen. Byron Dorgan, D-N.D., said on ``Fox News 
Sunday.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats continued to argue that the best outcome would be to  
approve a resolution censuring Clinton for his conduct with Ms. 
Lewinsky. ``We can't take a bye on the sort of moral judgment or 
value judgments that are involved here,'' Kerry said. 
</P>
<P>
	But Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, said he'd oppose a censure motion,  
even if the Senate fails to come up with the vote to convict. 
``Censure is to cover politicians,'' he said on ABC. ``I don't need 
any cover.''

<HEADLINE> Jets Mistakes Doom Super Bowl Bid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- Bill Parcells warned the New York Jets that if  
they made mistakes, they would never reach the Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	He was right.  
</P>
<P>
	``We helped them along quite a bit,'' the Jets coach said after  
Sunday's 23-10 loss to Denver in the AFC championship game. ``You 
can't make those mistakes and expect to win a championship game. 
Mistakes were the difference in the game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Parcells built his reputation with the New York Giants and New  
England Patriots as a coach whose teams controlled the ball with 
the running game, made the routine plays and almost never turned 
the ball over. 
</P>
<P>
	That's exactly what the Jets didn't do on Sunday.  
</P>
<P>
	They lost four fumbles and two interceptions, botched a Denver  
kickoff, rushed for just 14 yards, blew a coverage that gave the 
Broncos a long gain and missed a 42-yard field goal. 
</P>
<P>
	The misplays prevented the Jets from reaching the Super Bowl for  
the first time in 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
	The first two fumbles, by usually reliable Keith Byars and  
Curtis Martin, kept them from taking more than a 3-0 lead at 
halftime. 
</P>
<P>
	``We turned the ball over down in the scoring zone twice in the  
first half,'' Parcells said. ``Our mistakes when we were across 
midfield, and when you factor in the missed field goal, that was a 
potential 24 points out the window.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After the Jets took a 10-0 lead following a blocked punt inside  
the 5 in the third quarter, Denver scored 20 points before the 
period was over. 
</P>
<P>
	First, a mistake in coverage by safety Victor Green allowed John  
Elway to complete a 47-yard pass to Ed McCaffrey, setting up a 
touchdown that made it 10-7. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was my fault. I bit on the crossing route,'' Green said.  
``If we had made a stop there, we would have been in control of the 
game. They got a touchdown, and then got the ball back on the 
kickoff, and that changed the whole momentum.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Then came the most disastrous blooper. Jets return man Dave  
Meggett failed to field the ensuing short kickoff before James 
Farrior finally fumbled it away, leading to a field goal. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was no one else's responsibility. I have to take it  
wherever it goes,'' Meggett said. ``The previous kick came to the 
4, but the wind held the second one in the air and I didn't get a 
good read on it. The wind was very tricky.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Parcells said the Broncos were basically lucky on the botched  
kickoff. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can't tell me they intended to kick it that short,'' the  
coach said. 
</P>
<P>
	With the Broncos leading 20-10 in the fourth quarter, any hope  
of a Jets comeback ended when Alex Van Dyke fumbled the ball away 
after a reception deep in Denver territory and Vinny Testaverde 
threw two interceptions to Broncos cornerback Darrien Gordon. 
</P>
<P>
	``Even when it was 20-10, I thought we had a chance,'' Parcells  
said, ``but we continued to make mistakes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Perhaps the most shocking Jets shortcoming was the powerless  
running game. Martin had all of the team's 13 carries and finished 
with 14 yards. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was a man matched up on me wherever I went,'' said  
Martin, a Pro Bowl running back. ``I have to give them credit. They 
wrapped me up and made the tackles.''

<HEADLINE> Vodafone Buys AirTouch for $56B </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Britain's Vodafone Group PLC is accomplishing  
far more than the creation of the world's largest cellular phone 
company with its acquisition of AirTouch Communications Inc. for 
$56 billion in cash and stock. 
</P>
<P>
	With the purchase, London-based Vodafone gets access to the $30  
billion U.S. cellular phone market and AirTouch's fast-growing 
international assets, which stretch from Sweden to Egypt. 
</P>
<P>
	The announcement of the deal late Friday ended a two-week  
bidding war and came just hours after Bell Atlantic said it had 
broken off talks with AirTouch, the nation's second-largest 
independent cellular phone company. Bell Atlantic, a formidable 
East Coast phone company, had hoped to build a nationwide cellular 
network with the San Francisco-based AirTouch. 
</P>
<P>
	``AirTouch wins no matter who buys them, so they're happy,''  
said Jeffrey Kagan, an independent telecom analyst in Altanta. 
</P>
<P>
	Sam Ginn, chief executive of AirTouch, will become the new  
chairman of the combined company, which will be called Vodafone 
AirTouch PLC. Chris Gent, Vodafone's chief executive, will retain 
his title. 
</P>
<P>
	The announcement left open the possibility of further  
acquisitions, including deals outside the cellular phone business. 
</P>
<P>
	``Vodafone AirTouch will have the size and financial resources  
to take advantage of future opportunities, making the company a 
leading force not only within wireless but throughout the 
telecommunications industry,'' Ginn said in the joint statement. 
</P>
<P>
	The companies said they hoped to complete the deal in late 1999,  
pending approval by regulators in the United States and Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	The high-stakes bidding for AirTouch underscored the rapid  
transformation in the telephone industry and the big profits to be 
made in cellular phones. As the technology improves, cellular 
phones are quickly becoming an easy substitute for traditional 
telephones. 
</P>
<P>
	The number of worldwide cellular phone subscribers is expected  
to soar from 285 million in 1998 to 615 million within four years, 
according to Strategis Group, a telecom consulting company in 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	Much of that growth will come in countries like Russia, India  
and China, where it would be costly to connect remote villages. 
</P>
<P>
	Kagan said he had hoped that Bell Atlantic, which offered $45  
billion for AirTouch, would have won so that the two companies 
could have made a stronger challenge to AT&AMP;T Corp.'s national, 
flat-rate cellular phone plan. Bell Atlantic's pursuit of AirTouch 
had raised hopes for competition that would lower cellular phone 
charges in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	``Vodafone will now have a foothold in the United States, but I  
don't see that affecting the U.S. wireless marketplace,'' Kagan 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	New York-based Bell Atlantic had too much at risk to stay in the  
hunt-- a $62.55 billion acquisition of GTE Corp., which is still 
awaiting regulatory approval, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the bidding war made Bell Atlantic's stock price volatile,  
or fall, then that could have screwed up their deal with GTE, and 
they couldn't risk that,'' Kagan said. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal is the fifth most expensive merger involving a U.S.  
company. Bigger deals are the pending acquisition of regional phone 
company Ameritech Corp. by SBC Communications Inc. for $81.21 
billion in stock, Exxon Corp.'s pending $73.15 stock purchase of 
Mobil Corp., and British Petroleum PLC's recently completed 
acquisition of Amoco Corp. for $57.6 billion in stock. 
</P>
<P>
	AirTouch's shares rose $4.56 1/4 Friday to close at $83.37 1/2 a share  
on the New York Stock Exchange, while Vodafone's U.S. shares rose 
$1.43 3/4 to $176.

<HEADLINE> Public Not Getting Super Bowl Tix </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- The proof is there on page 6F, tucked between a  
bowling ad and a story on the 1968 Davis Cup match between Spain 
and South Africa. 
</P>
<P>
	``World Championship Football. Super Bowl. Jan. 14,'' the 3x6 ad  
says above an image of two players stretching for a pass. ``Tickets 
on sale for $6 and $8. Reserved seats at Orange Bowl Committee 
ticket office.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Surprising but true: When Miami was the site of its first Super  
Bowl 31 years ago, the NFL relied on newspaper ads to help sell 
tickets. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was totally unlike today,'' said Edwin Pope, longtime  
sports columnist for The Miami Herald, which ran the ad. ``Fans 
went to the games then. Now? Forget it, unless you're very rich.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There hasn't been a public sale of Super Bowl tickets in 25  
years. Prices have increased 50-fold at face value, perhaps five 
times that again on the resale market. Limousines and corporate 
hospitality tents dominate the scene. 
</P>
<P>
	The only way the average painted-chest, giant-foam-fingered  
diehard gets in these days is to hit the lottery or take out an ad. 
</P>
<P>
	``SUPER BOWL TICKETS WANTED (Needed) by fans, as many as 6.  
Please!'' reads one ad. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have a lot of major sporting events -- the World Cup, the  
Masters, the Final Four, but the Super Bowl is the big one that 
everybody wants to see,'' said Mark Halpern, a Fort Lauderdale 
ticket broker. 
</P>
<P>
	The inaugural Super Bowl attracted only 61,946 fans to the Los  
Angeles Coliseum in 1967, the event's only non-sellout. When the 
game moved to the Orange Bowl the following year, it still was a 
hard sell. 
</P>
<P>
	Most fans considered the AFL vastly inferior to the older NFL.  
Green Bay's demolition of Kansas City at Los Angeles did nothing to 
dispel that notion. 
</P>
<P>
	Miami Dolphins season-ticket holders could buy a Super Bowl  
ticket for every season ticket held. It still wasn't enough. 
</P>
<P>
	The NFL leaned on Miami businesses to help, with such entities  
as long-departed National Airlines receiving several tickets to use 
in promotions. 
</P>
<P>
	``We traveled to the site in October,'' said Don Weiss, the  
retired NFL executive director who organized the first 14 Super 
Bowls. ``We'd go around to the talk shows, hyping the game. It was 
a sell atmosphere in those days.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some 20,000 tickets went on public sale just before Thanksgiving  
1967. It took about a month to sell them all, Weiss said. 
</P>
<P>
	It was much the same when the Super Bowl returned to Miami the  
following year. That was when Joe Namath changed perceptions of the 
game. 
</P>
<P>
	Three days before Namath's New York Jets faced the heavily  
favored Baltimore Colts, the brash quarterback guaranteed a win. 
</P>
<P>
	The Jets won 16-7. And when Kansas City beat Minnesota the  
following year, it established the AFL -- soon to be the AFC -- as an 
equal. Within a few years, the Super Bowl changed dramatically. 
</P>
<P>
	The last public sale of Super Bowl tickets was for the 1971 game  
at Miami. The practice of offering season-ticket holders in the 
host city a one-for-one deal ended in 1972. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, the NFL has very specific percentages for ticket  
allocation. The league keeps 25.3 percent -- about 15,000 tickets 
this year -- for its use, with about two-thirds of those going to 
sponsors, advertisers and the TV network showing the game. 
</P>
<P>
	Each of the participating teams gets 17.5 percent of the  
tickets. The host team receives 10 percent and each of the other 27 
teams gets 1.1 percent. When club officials meet their needs for 
staff and business associates, the rest -- usually about half -- go 
into a lottery for season-ticket holders. 
</P>
<P>
	``You wind up making a lot of people unhappy,'' Dolphins  
president Eddie Jones said. ``People don't understand why they 
don't win. But that's what a lottery is.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For the desperate, there are the ticket brokers. But be prepared  
for a huge markup -- the going rate last week was $1,750 for an 
upper end-zone seat, without even knowing the participants. 
</P>
<P>
	It's illegal in Florida to buy or sell tickets for more than $1  
above face value. So Halpern's Front &AMP; Center Entertainment sells 
them as part of a package that includes programs, souvenirs and 
other perks. 
</P>
<P>
	Super Bowl ticket scarcity can be stressful for brokers. For  
last year's game at San Diego, Halpern contracted to sell some 
seats for $1,200, then had to shell out $2,000 to acquire the 
seats. 
</P>
<P>
	``You just bite the bullet and pay more money,'' said Halpern,  
who wouldn't divulge how much he lost. ``You take the hit and take 
care of your customers.''

<HEADLINE> Giuliani Changes Mind on Methadone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Mayor Rudolph Giuliani is backing off his plan  
to move thousands of heroin addicts into abstinence programs at 
city hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
	The mayor, who six months ago announced he wanted to abolish  
methadone treatment, said the original idea was ``maybe somewhat 
unrealistic,'' according to The New York Times. 
</P>
<P>
	City officials said Friday that the shift in policy came after a  
methadone-treatment experiment at five public hospitals resulted in 
few successes. Methadone, a synthetic drug, is prescribed to cut 
the craving for heroin. 
</P>
<P>
	After a five-month tryout, only 21 of the city's 2,100 treated  
addicts had given up the methadone, health officials said. And of 
those, five relapsed into heroin use. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Giuliani said drug treatment experts had persuaded him  
not to eliminate methadone programs, which researchers across the 
country still consider the best hope for most recovering heroin 
addicts.

<P>
	BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) -- NATO ambassadors held an emergency  
session at alliance headquarters today to decide on a strategy for 
dealing with the rapidly unraveling cease-fire in Kosovo. The 
threat of NATO airstrikes, hanging over the heads of Serb 
authorities since October, remained an option as Serb forces 
launched a new attack on the ethnic Albanian village of Racak, 
where 45 people were massacred, and reports emerged of attacks on 
other nearby communities.

	Massive Freeway Pileup Near Detroit  
</P>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Up to 50 cars and trucks smashed together in a  
massive freeway pileup this morning that witnesses said was caused 
by black ice and fog. Interstate 94 south of Detroit was shut down 
for several miles in both directions as tow trucks, and ambulance, 
police, and fire crews responded from several suburbs. There was no 
information on deaths or the number of injuries.

	WILMINGTON, Del. (AP) -- A politically connected lawyer who had  
an affair with the governor's secretary was convicted today of 
murdering her. Prosecutors say Thomas Capano also dumped the body 
of Anne Marie Fahey at sea. Jurors deliberated for three days 
before deciding Capano was guilty of killing Ms. Fahey, who was

<P>
	ARCADIA, Calif. (AP) -- Odds-on favorite Manistique recovered  
after a troubled start and nudged out long shot Gourmet Girl by a 
head to win the $150,000 El Encino Stakes at Santa Anita Park 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Manistique finished the 1 1/16 mile race for 4-year-old fillies  
in 1:43. Ridden by jockey Gary Stevens, she paid $2.80 to win. 
There was no place or show wagering. 
</P>
<P>
	Manistique bobbled at the start when the ground broke out from  
under her. The daughter of Unbridled quickly recovered and Stevens 
pushed her into the lead going into the first turn. But Gourmet 
Girl caught up and the two raced in tandem before Manistique pulled 
ahead in closing strides. 
</P>
<P>
	Magical Allure, the expected second choice, came in third -- 5 1/2  
lengths behind Gourmet Girl. 
</P>
<P>
	The victory was Manistique's fifth in six starts. She earned  
$90,000, bringing her career total to $346,700.

<HEADLINE> Bulls' Kerr Talks to Spurs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Three-point specialist and free agent Steve Kerr,  
a key member of three straight Chicago Bulls championship teams, is 
near a deal with the San Antonio Spurs, his agent says. 
</P>
<P>
	``We haven't agreed to anything,'' Mark Bartlestein said Sunday.  
``Nothing is done as of yet. We're close, but there are some things 
we're trying to finalize. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Spurs are a team we're interested in. We're working hard  
and something could happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Several teams have shown interest in Kerr, a 10-year veteran who  
is one of the most proficient 3-point shooters in NBA history. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wouldn't say the other teams were out of the loop,''  
Bartlestein said. ``We're just seeing if we can finalize a deal 
with the Spurs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kerr's departure is just another sign that the Bulls are  
preparing to break up after Michael Jordan's retirement last week. 
Free agents Scottie Pippen, Luc Longley and Dennis Rodman also are 
expected to leave as the dominant team of the decade dismantles 
following the NBA lockout.

<HEADLINE> Ed McCaffrey's Catch Ignites Broncs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- Ed McCaffrey and Rod Smith left the huddle and  
headed in the wrong direction. It turned out to be one of the best 
mistakes they've ever made. 
</P>
<P>
	With Denver in dire need of a spark, McCaffrey turned potential  
trouble into a game-turning, 47-yard catch that helped propel the 
Broncos to a 23-10 win over the New York Jets in Sunday's AFC 
championship game. 
</P>
<P>
	McCaffrey, named to his first Pro Bowl this season, was supposed  
to line up on the right side of the field and run a deep crossing 
pattern. Smith was supposed to line up on the left and run a post. 
</P>
<P>
	When McCaffrey tried to switch at the line of scrimmage,  
quarterback John Elway gave him a nudge back to the right and then 
connected for a long pass that set up Denver's first points of the 
game. 
</P>
<P>
	``They probably don't realize that was a busted play,'' Smith  
said. ``It wasn't really busted because we ended up running the 
right play, but the personnel and all that was messed up. It was a 
huge momentum swing for us. Everybody just got fired up after 
that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McCaffrey's catch doubled Elway's passing yardage to that point,  
and Howard Griffith's 11-yard TD reception 77 seconds later served 
as a sign of things to come for the frazzled Jets. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm glad I got to make a play because we were having a rough  
time up until then,'' McCaffrey said. ``It helped us get things 
going and then we were really on a roll from there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Trailing by only three and with the Mile High Stadium crowd back  
in the game, the Broncos got the ball back after Jason Elam 
inadvertently sent a wobbly kickoff into the swirling wind. 
</P>
<P>
	Caught off guard by the fluttering kick, the Jets scrambled to  
secure the ball, which eluded New York's James Farrior and ended up 
in the hands of Denver's Keith Burns. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was just one of those plays,'' Burns said. ``The ball got  
caught up in the air, and the wind caught it, and it took one of 
those Bronco bounces. Once I got on it, I knew I had the most 
prized possession on the football field, so I tried to hold onto it 
for dear life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The sudden turn of events took plenty of life out of the Jets,  
who saw their lead evaporate when Elam made a 44-yard field goal. 
</P>
<P>
	In less than two minutes, New York's 10-0 lead had turned into  
an irreversible debacle. 
</P>
<P>
	``They just exploded in the third quarter,'' Jets cornerback  
Aaron Glenn said. ``Once they hit that pass, they just kept 
pressing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Despite their misfortune, the Jets still had a chance to spoil  
what could turn out to be Elway's final game at Mile High Stadium 
and prevent the Broncos from earning their second straight Super 
Bowl trip. 
</P>
<P>
	But the offense bogged down, forcing two punts and committing  
three turnovers that Denver converted into 13 more points to 
improve to 6-1 in AFC championship games. 
</P>
<P>
	The Jets, who haven't been to the Super Bowl since 1969, never  
had another good scoring chance after Terrell Davis' 31-yard 
touchdown run capped a 20-point third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Alex Van Dyke fumbled after a reception inside Denver territory,  
and Vinny Testaverde threw two late interceptions that gave New 
York six turnovers for the game. 
</P>
<P>
	Denver, meanwhile, overcame a blocked punt, a failed  
fourth-and-goal at the New York 1 and a poor performance (4-for-14) 
by Elway in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
	As he has all season, Davis proved to be the X-factor for  
Denver, running for 167 yards and a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
	``We knew three points was not going to beat this football  
team,'' tight end Shannon Sharpe said. ``Ed and Rod started making 
some big catches and Terrell started taking the ball game over. ... 
We stayed on course and now we're going to Miami.''

saved Iron Mike's career. Botha also appeared to be having the best 
of the fifth round when, with about 10 seconds left, he went to 
throw a right to the body. Tyson countered with a perfectly 
balanced right that crashed full into Botha's face and dropped him.

<HEADLINE> DaimlerChrysler, Nissan Talk Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Of all the mergers and acquisitions that have  
been rumored lately in the global auto industry, the possible 
marriage of DaimlerChrysler AG and Nissan Motor Co. is the most 
intriguing. 
</P>
<P>
	But does it make any sense?  
</P>
<P>
	On one side is DaimlerChrysler, born of the megamerger of  
Chrysler Corp. and Germany's Daimler-Benz AG. Only 2 months old, 
it's still deep in the mire of combining its vast operations and 
creating a new corporate culture distinct from that of its German 
and American ancestors. 
</P>
<P>
	Then there's Nissan. Once one of Japan's biggest success  
stories, Nissan today is struggling to survive under an estimated 
$22 billion in debt. Faced with this sea of red ink in a 
consolidating industry, Nissan's leaders are looking for help. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, each side publicly flirted with one other.  
DaimlerChrysler co-chairman Juergen Schrempp hinted that his 
company's considering a stake in Nissan. Nissan President Yoshikazu 
Hanawa was quoted as saying Nissan would seriously consider a 
DaimlerChrysler proposal. 
</P>
<P>
	This week, Schrempp and co-chairman Robert J. Eaton plan to  
visit Tokyo for a long-planned Mercedes-Benz event. A meeting of 
Schrempp and Hanawa reportedly is scheduled. 
</P>
<P>
	Daimler and Nissan officials have been in talks since before the  
DaimlerChrysler merger about a possible deal involving Nissan's 
commercial truck unit, Nissan Diesel Motor Co. Reports that 
DaimlerChrysler was considering a larger investment in Nissan 
itself surfaced last month. 
</P>
<P>
	Before the merger with Daimler-Benz, Chrysler was approached  
more than once with proposals to buy into Nissan and Eaton rejected 
the idea as too risky, said a former Chrysler executive, speaking 
on condition of anonymity. Ford Motor Co. reportedly rejected a 20 
percent stake last year. 
</P>
<P>
	In theory, a DaimlerChrysler-Nissan alliance could position  
DaimlerChrysler to better compete against Ford, General Motors 
Corp., Toyota Motor Corp. and Volkswagen AG, which have more 
extensive investments in China and other Asian developing markets. 
</P>
<P>
	Schrempp and Eaton need a bigger presence in Asia to achieve  
their goal to make DaimlerChrysler the world's leading 
transportation company. Nissan, Japan's second-largest automaker 
with an extensive dealer network in Asia, could deliver that fast. 
</P>
<P>
	``DaimlerChrysler has made no secret that it would like to have  
a third leg of a trans-Atlantic partnership,'' said analyst John 
Lawson of Salomon Smith Barney in London. ``They are very focused 
on making themselves one of the global colossi that people believe 
are going to be striding the automotive globe in a few years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If DaimlerChrysler buys a stake in Nissan, it's likely to be a  
minority position that limits its exposure to Nissan's huge debt. 
Even so, DaimlerChrysler could call the shots -- just as Ford does 
with its Japanese partner, Mazda Motor Corp., and General Motors 
does with Isuzu Motors Ltd. 
</P>
<P>
	``Whoever is the strong partner financially really defines the  
way the business is going to be run,'' said David Cole, an industry 
expert at the University of Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawson said he doubts DaimlerChrysler would buy a large enough  
stake to become involved in direct management of Nissan because 
that would be hard to sell to shareholders. But he thinks a deal 
could benefit both companies in the long run. 
</P>
<P>
	Others are skeptical.  
</P>
<P>
	``Nobody's going to take on Nissan, not even DaimlerChrysler,  
unless they're all extremely naive,'' said analyst Maryann Keller 
with ING Baring Furman Selz in New York. ``There is not an 
automaker on the planet that can take on Nissan's losses and its 
corporate culture.'' 
</P>
<P>
	DaimlerChrysler and Nissan have a great deal of product overlap  
-- Nissan's cars and light trucks compete against Chrysler, Dodge, 
Plymouth and Jeep products. Nissan's Infiniti unit is a direct 
competitor with Mercedes-Benz. That wasn't a problem when Daimler 
and Chrysler merged. 
</P>
<P>
	But that also could provide the opportunity to combine some  
vehicle platforms -- the common chassis and mechanicals used for 
different models -- to spread out costs across more vehicles. Unlike 
its larger competitors, DaimlerChrysler has no high-volume 
platforms in the million-unit range. 
</P>
<P>
	But the biggest obstacle remains Nissan's debt. Cole said Nissan  
can't expect DaimlerChrysler or any other automaker to bail it out. 
</P>
<P>
	``At some point there's going to have to be some level of  
forgiveness from the banks,'' he said. ``They're not going to get 
an outside company to come in and swallow that debt. A little bit, 
maybe, but any more is impossible.''

<HEADLINE> Rapper Arrested After Cop Shootout </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Rapper ODB was arrested on a charge of attempted  
murder after a shootout with police -- the latest addition to a 
growing nonmusical rap sheet. 
</P>
<P>
	Russell Jones, the real name of the Wu-Tang Clan singer also  
known as Big Baby Jesus, and another man were driving a sport 
utility vehicle with its headlights off when police tried to pull 
them over in Brooklyn on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	An unmarked police car with four plainclothes officers chased  
Jones after he tried to flee, police said. He was later pulled over 
and when two officers approached, two shots were fired from the 
drivers side, police said. Police returned fire as Jones drove off 
again. No one was injured. 
</P>
<P>
	Another police car stopped Jones a few blocks away and he was  
arrested. 
</P>
<P>
	Police found the second man shortly after in a nearby building  
and questioned him. He was released and was not charged in the 
incident, said Officer Olga Mercado, an NYPD spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones, 29, pleaded innocent Saturday to charges of attempted  
murder in the second degree, attempted murder of a police officer 
in the first degree, and criminal possession of a weapon. Bail was 
set at $150,000 and Jones was ordered to reappear in court Jan. 21. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones' attorney, Peter Frankel, said the passenger told police  
that his client did not have a gun. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our version is that he was pulled over by an unmarked police  
car. Undercover police officers came at him with guns drawn. ... He 
drove off and they fired shots at him. He feared for his life,'' 
Frankel said. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no evidence ... that Russell Jones fired a weapon,''  
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Frankel also disputed police allegations that they pulled Jones  
over for failing to turn on his headlights, saying television 
footage of the rapper's arrest show the truck's lights were on. 
</P>
<P>
	The arrest is the fourth for the rapper since July.  
</P>
<P>
	In November, he allegedly threatened to kill his former  
girlfriend -- the mother of their 1-year-old child -- after climbing 
over a security gate to enter the property where she worked. 
</P>
<P>
	He was charged with threatening to kill security officers last  
September at a blues club in West Hollywood, Calif., and in July he 
allegedly stole a pair of shoes in Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones faced various larceny, assault and fraud charges going  
back to 1987, Mercado said. He's also been accused of being a 
deadbeat dad for failing to pay court-mandated child support to 
three of his children, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	At the Grammy Awards last year, Jones crashed the stage and  
hijacked a microphone from singer Shawn Colvin. Angry at having 
lost in the best rap album category to Sean ``Puff Daddy'' Combs, 
Jones complained that he had spent a lot of money for new clothes 
because he thought he would win.

<HEADLINE> Senators Unprotected From Influence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- If the Senate trial of President Clinton were  
a regular court case, attempts to influence how the senators vote 
would be considered jury tampering. In this case, it's perfectly 
all right. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's nothing wrong with writing in and saying what's on  
your mind,'' said Charles Geyh, an Indiana University law 
professor. ``And there's nothing wrong with a senator taking his 
constituents' views into account as part of the mix. ... I think 
it's democracy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In his first ruling of the impeachment trial, Chief Justice  
William H. Rehnquist said Friday the Senate ``is not simply a jury; 
it is a court in this case.'' Therefore, lawyers should not refer 
to the senators as jurors, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	That ruling reflects the many differences between the Senate in  
Clinton's case and a jury in a civil or criminal court case. 
</P>
<P>
	Those jurors are screened to make sure they are not connected to  
the case or anyone involved in it. They are entitled to rule on the 
facts only, not the law, and they don't get to decide whether 
witnesses will be called. 
</P>
<P>
	And they are ordered not to view media reports about the case or  
to talk about it with anyone. 
</P>
<P>
	In the impeachment case, the senators are being bombarded with  
other people's views -- public opinion polls, letters and phone 
calls from constituents. Internet web sites invite people to e-mail 
their opinions to senators. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn., said last week senators ought  
not be controlled by the polls. However, he added, ``I think it's 
appropriate to take notice of the polls because of what this is. 
This is a trial established by the framers of the Constitution to 
decide whether an election should be overturned.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A different view was expressed by another senator during  
President Andrew Johnson's 1868 impeachment trial. Sen. Edmund 
Ross, R-Kan., got a telegram signed by one man ``and 1,000 others'' 
that said, ``Kansas has heard the evidence, and demands the 
conviction of the president.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ross was offended and responded, ``I do not recognize your right  
to demand that I shall vote either for or against conviction. I 
have taken an oath to do impartial justice.'' Ross voted to acquit. 
</P>
<P>
	Senators in impeachment trials swear to be impartial, but ``not  
in the same way an ordinary juror swears to be impartial,'' Geyh 
said. By choosing the Senate to hear impeachment cases, the 
Constitution's framers created a ``healthy tension'' between the 
vow of impartiality and the political nature of the case, he added. 
</P>
<P>
	``Impeachable offenses are defined as whether someone abused the  
public trust, and who better than the public, through their 
representatives, to decide?'' Geyh said. 
</P>
<P>
	Drake University law professor Hunter R. Clark noted that  
senators can remove Clinton from office even if they do not believe 
he technically violated any law. 
</P>
<P>
	``You don't necessarily have to break a law to commit what in  
the Constitution warrants removal from office,'' he said. And no 
matter how the impeachment case turns out, Clinton still can be 
indicted later and convicted of any crimes he may have committed. 
</P>
<P>
	Democratic Sen. Tom Harkin, who won Rehnquist's ruling that  
senators should not be called jurors, contended the term implied 
their role was limited to deciding the facts. 
</P>
<P>
	But emphasizing the difference between senators and jurors could  
work against Clinton's argument that senators should use a legal 
standard required for criminal trial juries -- conviction only if 
the case is proved beyond a reasonable doubt.

<HEADLINE> GM Union No Longer Feels Invincible </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LORDSTOWN, Ohio (AP) -- Back when Darwin Cooper landed a car  
assembly job at General Motors' brand new plant in 1966, he had a 
youthful sense of invincibility. 
</P>
<P>
	He was just 19. He had a job with good pay and good benefits  
that would probably last as long as he could imagine. 
</P>
<P>
	He and his buddies wouldn't hesitate to confront management, and  
manager-worker tempers often flared. During the plant's first dozen 
years, there were strikes and near-strikes. Lordstown GM workers 
quickly built not only cars, but a reputation. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a young and radical work force,'' Cooper recalled. ``I  
really believe it had a lot to do with our country at the time. 
There was the Vietnam War. There were protests going on. Things 
were just pretty unsettled.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But there was a national demand for small cars, and employment  
at the Lordstown plant kept growing, swelling to about 10,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Eventually, those young workers started families, bought houses,  
became involved in their communities, sent their kids to college 
and mellowed, Cooper says. 
</P>
<P>
	Now 52, with silver hair and glasses, Cooper, known as ``Coop''  
to GM Lordstown workers, stopped working at the plant just a year 
and a half ago to devote his time to issues facing United Auto 
Workers Local 1112, the local representing the plant's present 
5,300 workers. He is the local's vice president. 
</P>
<P>
	Lordstown GM's story contrasts sharply now with those early  
years. No one feels invincible. The U.S. economy is a cog in the 
world economy. 
</P>
<P>
	The UAW is negotiating with GM to keep Lordstown GM going past  
the year 2002, when production of the Pontiac Sunfire and Chevrolet 
Cavalier is expected to end. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think there is a lot of concern. I wouldn't say worry,  
though,'' Cooper said. 
</P>
<P>
	GM Vice President Mark Hogan said last week a plan -- called  
Project Yellowstone -- to replace some of the automaker's 
unprofitable small-car assembly plants with more efficient ones 
would reduce labor costs and allow the automaker's manufacturing to 
be more flexible. 
</P>
<P>
	The new plants are expected to dramatically reduce GM's costs by  
giving independent suppliers a larger role in designing and 
assembling parts for the cars. 
</P>
<P>
	If Lordstown GM is selected for the next generation of GM small  
cars, the work force is likely to be reduced to about 2,000. 
Workers and others in the region see that as a better option than a 
plant closure. Cooper said it's a chance for longtime workers to 
flow into retirement. 
</P>
<P>
	``The importance of the Lordstown GM plant to this area is  
immeasurable, absolutely immeasurable,'' said Youngstown Mayor 
George McKelvey. Lordstown, a village with a population of about 
4,000, is about 15 miles west of Youngstown. 
</P>
<P>
	``Do I pray every Sunday for it? Yes,'' McKelvey said.  
</P>
<P>
	For about two months, the union local has been involved in talks  
with GM on work rule and employment issues pertaining only to 
Lordstown GM. The union hopes an agreement could set the stage for 
GM committing to remake the plant for future production. 
</P>
<P>
	Those talks ``have been very professional,'' Cooper said. ``Have  
there been disagreements? Of course there have. That's called 
negotiating. There's give and take. 
</P>
<P>
	``Here's how we see it: We're not in competition with any other  
plants. We're in competition with a dollar amount. What General 
Motors is saying to us is, if you can get this car built for X 
number of dollars, we're going to give you the project.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cooper said the talks have been going well, and union officials  
are hoping for some positive news within a few weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	In the meantime, uncertainty lingers.  
</P>
<P>
	``People get scared,'' said Harry Peterson, who runs a  
family-owned hardware store in Lordstown and is very familiar with 
the plant's workers. ``I think they are doing whatever they can to 
make it work out. I think they will bend over backwards to help 
keep the plant. I sense that the employees are really trying to 
make it work.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton Seeks Child Care Credit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton's fiscal 2000 budget will  
propose a $500 child care tax credit for stay-at-home parents, an 
idea pushed last year by congressional Republicans, administrations 
sources said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's proposal would allow a tax credit of up to $500 for  
families with a child aged 1 or younger, according to a White House 
official who spoke on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	The sliding-scale credit, pegged to family income, is expected  
to cost $1.3 billion over five years, allowing for an average tax 
credit of $178, the official said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton is expected to outline the proposal in his State of the  
Union address Tuesday night before a joint session of Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	In yet another proposal expected to be in the speech, Health and  
Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala told The Washington Post in 
an interview appearing in Monday's editions that Clinton will call 
for $1 billion over five years to improve health care for many of 
the nation's 32 million uninsured adults. The money would be used 
to encourage community clinics and hospitals to work together to 
keep track of patients and make sure they get needed treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	Including the latest one, the administration has made health  
proposals that would cost about $10 billion over five years, 
including tax breaks for long-term care, a plan to allow people 
with disabilities to purchase insurance through Medicare and 
Medicaid and another to allow people aged 55 to 64 to buy coverage 
through Medicare. 
</P>
<P>
	The tax credit is expected to benefit 1.7 million families. A  
family earning $30,000 per year with one working parent would be 
able to claim the full $500 in child care expenses, rather than the 
$250 they are allowed under current law. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposal is part of a larger child care package that seeks a  
total of $18 billion over five years to aid working poor and middle 
class families. 
</P>
<P>
	That broader package -- absent the stay-at-home-mom credit -- is  
similar to what Clinton sought last year: $7.5 billion for 
expanding child care subsidies to serve an extra 1.15 million 
children; $5 billion in tax credits for non-parental care of a 
child younger than 13, or a disabled dependent or spouse; $3 
billion for grants for preschool programs; a $500 million tax 
credit for businesses that provide child care services for their 
employees; $600 million for after-school programs and $173 million 
for inspections, training and other efforts to improve child care. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, Clinton put forth a $22 billion proposal, tied to  
revenue from the proposed tobacco settlement, but it went nowhere 
on Capitol Hill, in part because Republicans said it failed to 
address parents who do not work outside the home. 
</P>
<P>
	With the revamped plan, the White House was hoping to take some  
steam out of that argument, giving GOP leaders what amounts to a 
political dare. ``There's no excuse for Congress not acting on 
child care now,'' the official said. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the official declined to reveal how the tax credit  
would be financed, other than to say it would be through ``a host 
of options'' being exercised in Clinton's budget and would not be 
tied to a tobacco tax increase. 
</P>
<P>
	White House officials said Clinton's specific tax credit for  
stay-at-home parents is patterned after one offered last year by 
Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn. The rest of Clinton's package 
incorporates elements of a Senate proposal offered by Sens. Orrin 
Hatch and John Chafee, they said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Chafee-Hatch bill called for $15 billion to $16 billion over  
five years, including a dependent-care tax credit for stay-at-home 
parents of up to $900 per year per family.

<HEADLINE> KO Punch Turned Around Tyson Bout </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- One punch silenced Francois Botha. It did not  
silence Mike Tyson's critics. 
</P>
<P>
	Until he knocked out his taunting opponent with a counter right  
to the head in the fifth round, Tyson was headed for his third 
straight loss, one that would have wrecked his career. 
</P>
<P>
	He lost all of the first four rounds on the cards of two judges  
and won only one round on the third judge's card. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't prove anything,'' Tyson said. ``I'm just trying. I've  
got a long way to go. We're working on it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While Tyson hasn't lost his punching power, many in boxing  
contend his performance Saturday night underscored the opinion that 
he has fallen a long way from his pedestal as ``the baddest man on 
the planet,'' and it is too late to climb back. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll be back in the gym in two weeks,'' said Tyson, whose  
flawed but spectacular victory in the MGM Grand Garden was his 
first fight since he bit Evander Holyfield's ears June 28, 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Plans call for Tyson, who has multiple-bout deals with Showtime  
and with the MGM Grand, to fight again April 24. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if his next opponent would be Axel Schulz of Germany, who  
was at ringside Saturday night, Tyson said. ``I don't know. I 
guess. I'll fight anybody.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Schulz, who lost title-bout decisions to George Foreman and to  
Botha, is one of the names on a list of prospective opponents. 
</P>
<P>
	Jay Larkin, in charge of boxing for Showtime, had said the  
quality of Tyson's performance against Botha would determine the 
quality of his next opponent. 
</P>
<P>
	Schulz, like Botha, is not a big puncher. At the moment, Tyson  
does not need to face a power puncher. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson, who will be 33 on June 30, now must turn his attention to  
out-of-the-ring problems. 
</P>
<P>
	On Feb. 5, he faces sentencing in Maryland on a no-contest plea  
on two misdemeanor assault charges. One man accused Tyson of 
punching him and another accused of kicking him in the groin after 
a traffic accident involving his wife, Monica. Tyson has settled 
with both men out of court. 
</P>
<P>
	After the sentencing, Indiana authorities will consider whether  
Tyson violated his parole and what action, if any, they will take. 
Tyson served three years in an Indiana prison on a rape conviction. 
His probation is to end in March. 
</P>
<P>
	Those closely involved with Tyson's career seem confident he  
will not be sent back to prison. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson wants to fight four times this year, and Larkin would like  
to see that fourth fight be a third match with Holyfield, who 
stopped Tyson in 11th round Nov. 9, 1996, then won the Bite Fight. 
</P>
<P>
	The Tyson who beat Botha wasn't as good as the Tyson who lost  
the two Holyfield fights. 
</P>
<P>
	Tommy Brooks, Tyson's new trainer, had Tyson working on basics  
in preparation for Botha. But Saturday night, Tyson didn't punch to 
the body, hardly ever jabbed and loaded up on his punches in quest 
of a knockout. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if he knew he was behind on points, Tyson said, ``I wasn't  
worried about that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brooks said Sunday, ``He said, `I got him in my sights coach,  
just give me time.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson should have been worried. Many of his power punches were  
wild, and he was getting popped by right hands. 
</P>
<P>
	Age and two long periods of inactivity have robbed Tyson of much  
of the quickness that made him the world's most feared fighter from 
1986 to 1990. That quickness enabled Tyson to overcome the fact 
that he is a small heavyweight. He is listed at 5-foot-11 1-2 but 
is closer to 5-9 1-2. 
</P>
<P>
	One important thing gone from Tyson's arsenal is intimidation.  
Botha showed no fear of Iron Mike. 
</P>
<P>
	At the end of the first round the two men, who were in a clinch  
at the bell, began a hitting-and-shoving match that brought a dozen 
security and corner men scrambling into the ring, 
</P>
<P>
	``Mike grabbed my arm, he was trying to break my arm,'' Botha  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if that was the case, Tyson replied, ``He's correct. He  
got tough with me and I got tough right back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Botha, nicknamed the White Buffalo, certainly gave as good as he  
got when it came to mauling, and he more than held is own in trash 
talking. 
</P>
<P>
	``We kept badmouthing each other,'' said Botha, a 30-year-old  
South African living in Newport Beach, Calif. ``I don't think you 
want to hear what was said. 
</P>
<P>
	``He talked more than I did,'' said Tyson, who was penalized a  
point in the second round for excessive holding. 
</P>
<P>
	The extent of the tear in Tyson's cloak of intimidation became  
clear in the fourth round. Botha stopped and made a mocking gesture 
to Tyson to the amusement of many in the announced crowd of 12,519. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was trying to psyche him,'' Botha said. ``I feel I was in  
control of the fight until I walked into that punch.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The punch caught Botha flush in the face, and he dropped in a  
heap. He tried to get up but fell back to the canvas. He struggled 
up at the count of seven, but fell into the ropes as referee 
Richard Steele signaled the fight over with one second left in the 
fifth round. Botha then slumped to the floor. 
</P>
<P>
	When discussing future bouts at the post-fight news conference,  
Tyson said, ``If the price is right, I'll fight a lion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It took a perfect punch to keep his career from being trampled  
by a White Buffalo.

<HEADLINE> CDC: Death Toll at 9 in Outbreak </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- A bacterial outbreak linked to a Michigan meat  
processing plant has killed nine people and caused three 
stillbirths, according to the Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention. 
</P>
<P>
	The outbreak has sickened more than 60 people in 12 states since  
August, the CDC said Friday. The states are Ohio, New York, 
Tennessee, Massachusetts, West Virginia, Michigan, Connecticut, 
Oregon, Vermont, Georgia, Minnesota and Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
	Sara Lee, parent company of the Bil Mar Foods plant in Zeeland,  
Mich., recalled several brands of hot dogs and cold cuts last month 
after the CDC found listeria contamination in unopened packages of 
hot dogs and deli meat produced at the plant. 
</P>
<P>
	Healthy people can usually fight off the bacteria with no more  
than flu-like symptoms. But listeria can cause meningitis or blood 
infections, particularly in pregnant women, the elderly and people 
with weak immune systems.

<HEADLINE> Tour Bus Flips on Illinois Highway </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PRINCETON, Ill. (AP) -- A tour bus skidded off an ice-coated  
stretch of Interstate 80 west of Chicago and flipped on its side 
Sunday, sending all 46 passengers to the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	The bus was headed from Chicago to riverboat casinos on the  
Mississippi River near Moline, Master Sgt. John Balma of the 
Illinois State Police said. The driver was not injured. 
</P>
<P>
	``We noticed the bus started to swerve to the left and the  
driver was fighting it,'' said passenger Billie Morris. ``Next, we 
were laying on the side.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gerald Boyd, 56, of Chicago, was taken to OSF Saint Francis  
Medical Center in Peoria in critical condition, suffering from 
several broken bones, according to hospital spokeswoman Michele 
Sheppard. Ella Abram, 50, of Chicago, also was taken to Saint 
Francis in serious condition with head injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	The other 44 passengers were treated and released from various  
hospitals for a variety of injuries, including broken bones, cuts 
and bruises. Most of the passengers were related, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials at Neal's Bus Company, the Chicago-based company that  
operates the bus, declined to comment. 
</P>
<P>
	No other vehicles were involved. Balma said police were  
investigating and had not decided whether the driver would be 
ticketed.

<HEADLINE> Court To Hear Volleyball Lawsuit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) -- An NCAA eligibility ruling ended Renee  
Smith's college volleyball career and inspired her legal career. 
</P>
<P>
	``Because I graduated early and wanted to go to grad school, I  
couldn't keep playing. It didn't make sense to me then and it still 
doesn't,'' Smith said of the bylaw that kept her off the volleyball 
court while pursuing her MBA and law degrees. 
</P>
<P>
	She accuses the National Collegiate Athletic Association of sex  
discrimination in a lawsuit that will be argued Wednesday before 
the U.S. Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
	``Renee is the quintessential student-athlete. Here's a woman  
who graduates in 2 1/2 years and the NCAA says 'No, you can't play 
anymore,''' said Carter Phillips, a Washington lawyer who will 
argue her case. 
</P>
<P>
	Her lawsuit accuses the NCAA of granting more eligibility  
waivers to men than women in violation of Title IX, the federal law 
banning sexual discrimination by any program getting federal aid. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith graduated from St. Bonaventure University in upstate New  
York in 1993 and went on to Hofstra University on Long Island for a 
master's degree in business administration. She hoped to play 
intercollegiate volleyball there, and as a law student at the 
University of Pittsburgh a year and a half later. 
</P>
<P>
	Both times, the NCAA refused to waive a rule that limits  
graduate students' athletic eligibility to the school where they 
receive their undergraduate degree. Smith never played another 
college volleyball game. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith was a first-year law student when she first sued in U.S.  
District Court in Pittsburgh in August 1995, primarily accusing the 
NCAA of violating antitrust laws. 
</P>
<P>
	The case was dismissed, and Smith appealed. The 3rd U.S. Circuit  
Court of Appeals in Philadelphia ruled out the antitrust claim but 
reinstated her right to argue a Title IX violation, a side issue in 
the original suit. The NCAA appealed that ruling, saying it is not 
bound by Title IX because it receives no federal funds. 
</P>
<P>
	``The important legal argument here for us is not whether the  
NCAA should or should not comply with Title IX. We obviously 
believe that the NCAA should on a voluntary basis comply with Title 
IX,'' NCAA spokesman Wally Renfro said. ``But we do not want to 
acknowledge that legal argument that we are the recipient of 
federal funds.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Smith contends that the NCAA does receive federal money through  
dues paid by member institutions, which get federal support. 
Phillips says Congress did not intend to give the NCAA a ``free 
pass'' when it passed Title IX in 1972. 
</P>
<P>
	Renfro acknowledged that more male athletes receive NCAA waivers  
than women, but only because more men apply for them. He said a 
higher percentage of female applicants are granted waivers. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith won't be finished with the NCAA once her case has been  
resolved. As a lawyer, she plans to represent other students who 
want to challenge the board that governs college athletics. 
</P>
<P>
	``Going against a major organization who doesn't really answer  
to anyone -- it's a very frustrating experience,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith grew up in Wintersville, near the Ohio-West Virginia state  
line, where she is studying for the Ohio bar exam she will take in 
February. She works for her father's mining and industrial supply 
company and last fall was an assistant volleyball coach at Weir 
High School in nearby Weirton, W.Va. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith, who spent last summer in Los Angeles and has passed the  
California bar, said the legal wrangling has been a tremendous 
learning experience. 
</P>
<P>
	Her college volleyball days are over. Even if she pursued a  
fourth academic degree, the NCAA allows only four years of 
eligibility during five consecutive years of school. Smith's 
five-year window closed in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't think that it could actually be happening. I thought  
I had every reason for them to grant an exception,'' she said. ``It 
seemed unfair and it seemed ridiculous that this organization could 
prohibit me for doing exactly what their goals are.''

<HEADLINE> DaimlerChrysler, Nissan Talk Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Of all the mergers and acquisitions that have  
been rumored lately in the global auto industry, the possible 
marriage of DaimlerChrysler AG and Nissan Motor Co. is the most 
intriguing. 
</P>
<P>
	But does it make any sense?  
</P>
<P>
	On one side is DaimlerChrysler, born of the megamerger of  
Chrysler Corp. and Germany's Daimler-Benz AG. Only 2 months old, 
it's still deep in the mire of combining its vast operations and 
creating a new corporate culture distinct from that of its German 
and American ancestors. 
</P>
<P>
	Then there's Nissan. Once one of Japan's biggest success  
stories, Nissan today is struggling to survive under an estimated 
$22 billion in debt. Faced with this sea of red ink in a 
consolidating industry, Nissan's leaders are looking for help. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, each side publicly flirted with one other.  
DaimlerChrysler co-chairman Juergen Schrempp hinted that his 
company's considering a stake in Nissan. Nissan President Yoshikazu 
Hanawa was quoted as saying Nissan would seriously consider a 
DaimlerChrysler proposal. 
</P>
<P>
	This week, Schrempp and co-chairman Robert J. Eaton plan to  
visit Tokyo for a long-planned Mercedes-Benz event. A meeting of 
Schrempp and Hanawa reportedly is scheduled. 
</P>
<P>
	Daimler and Nissan officials have been in talks since before the  
DaimlerChrysler merger about a possible deal involving Nissan's 
commercial truck unit, Nissan Diesel Motor Co. Reports that 
DaimlerChrysler was considering a larger investment in Nissan 
itself surfaced last month. 
</P>
<P>
	Before the merger with Daimler-Benz, Chrysler was approached  
more than once with proposals to buy into Nissan and Eaton rejected 
the idea as too risky, said a former Chrysler executive, speaking 
on condition of anonymity. Ford Motor Co. reportedly rejected a 20 
percent stake last year. 
</P>
<P>
	In theory, a DaimlerChrysler-Nissan alliance could position  
DaimlerChrysler to better compete against Ford, General Motors 
Corp., Toyota Motor Corp. and Volkswagen AG, which have more 
extensive investments in China and other Asian developing markets. 
</P>
<P>
	Schrempp and Eaton need a bigger presence in Asia to achieve  
their goal to make DaimlerChrysler the world's leading 
transportation company. Nissan, Japan's second-largest automaker 
with an extensive dealer network in Asia, could deliver that fast. 
</P>
<P>
	``DaimlerChrysler has made no secret that it would like to have  
a third leg of a trans-Atlantic partnership,'' said analyst John 
Lawson of Salomon Smith Barney in London. ``They are very focused 
on making themselves one of the global colossi that people believe 
are going to be striding the automotive globe in a few years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If DaimlerChrysler buys a stake in Nissan, it's likely to be a  
minority position that limits its exposure to Nissan's huge debt. 
Even so, DaimlerChrysler could call the shots -- just as Ford does 
with its Japanese partner, Mazda Motor Corp., and General Motors 
does with Isuzu Motors Ltd. 
</P>
<P>
	``Whoever is the strong partner financially really defines the  
way the business is going to be run,'' said David Cole, an industry 
expert at the University of Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawson said he doubts DaimlerChrysler would buy a large enough  
stake to become involved in direct management of Nissan because 
that would be hard to sell to shareholders. But he thinks a deal 
could benefit both companies in the long run. 
</P>
<P>
	Others are skeptical.  
</P>
<P>
	``Nobody's going to take on Nissan, not even DaimlerChrysler,  
unless they're all extremely naive,'' said analyst Maryann Keller 
with ING Baring Furman Selz in New York. ``There is not an 
automaker on the planet that can take on Nissan's losses and its 
corporate culture.'' 
</P>
<P>
	DaimlerChrysler and Nissan have a great deal of product overlap  
-- Nissan's cars and light trucks compete against Chrysler, Dodge, 
Plymouth and Jeep products. Nissan's Infiniti unit is a direct 
competitor with Mercedes-Benz. That wasn't a problem when Daimler 
and Chrysler merged. 
</P>
<P>
	But that also could provide the opportunity to combine some  
vehicle platforms -- the common chassis and mechanicals used for 
different models -- to spread out costs across more vehicles. Unlike 
its larger competitors, DaimlerChrysler has no high-volume 
platforms in the million-unit range. 
</P>
<P>
	But the biggest obstacle remains Nissan's debt. Cole said Nissan  
can't expect DaimlerChrysler or any other automaker to bail it out. 
</P>
<P>
	``At some point there's going to have to be some level of  
forgiveness from the banks,'' he said. ``They're not going to get 
an outside company to come in and swallow that debt. A little bit, 
maybe, but any more is impossible.''

<HEADLINE> Repeat Winners at Houston Marathon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- Tatiana Pozdnyakova of Ukraine, who won the 1996  
Houston Marathon but was disqualified for using a banned substance, 
overcame slippery streets and humidity to win the women's event for 
the third time Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Stephen Ndungu defended the men's title with a time of 2 hours,  
14 minutes, 56 seconds, leading a 1-2-3 Kenyan finish -- an 
identical finish to the 1998 race. Pozdnyakova was timed at 
2:33:23. Each first-place finisher received $25,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Pozdnyakova won at Houston in 1995 and in 1996 but she was  
disqualified in 1996 when tests showed she had taken 
pseudoephedrine and ephredrine. Both substances are found in 
over-the-counter cold medications but are banned by the 
International Olympic Committee and the International Amateur 
Athletic Federation. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's like a coughing (medicine),'' Pozdnyakova said through a  
translator. ``It's not my mistake. I don't take it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	More than 5,000 runners battled 93 percent humidity and  
temperatures in the 70s at the end of the race. Streets were 
slippery from early morning dew. 
</P>
<P>
	Olympic gymnastics gold medalist Kerri Strug ran her first  
marathon in 4:15:00 and felt the bite of the warm conditions. 
</P>
<P>
	``As soon as I hit 20 miles, it hit me,'' Strug said. ``I had to  
walk for a little while and then I told myself, `Just finish.' The 
only thing that hurt was my chest. I couldn't breathe.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pozdnyakova, 43, ran a slow first half before overtaking Zinaida  
Semenova of Russia at the 22-mile mark. Semenova finished second at 
2:36:23. 
</P>
<P>
	Elfenseh Alemu of Ethiopia led much of the race before fading to  
third at 2:37:05. 
</P>
<P>
	Poznyakova charged at the right time.  
</P>
<P>
	``We were all running together,'' she said. ``Some wanted to  
pull away but I wanted to keep a steady pace. I wasn't worried. I 
felt I could run faster, that I could set a faster pace.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ndungu beat countrymen Sammy Maritim and Gideon Mutisya. Ndungu,  
who fell behind during the 16th mile, regained the lead during the 
19th mile. Maritim was second at 2:15:05 and Mutisya third at 
2:15:14. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had to be cautious because the road was slippery, you could  
lose your grip,'' Ndungu said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ndungu's winning time a year ago was 2:11:23.

<HEADLINE> Orioles Owner Attends Cuban Game </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HAVANA (AP) -- Surrounded by Cuban families enjoying a day at the  
ballpark, Orioles owner Peter Angelos attended a game Sunday as 
part of his plan to arrange exhibitions in Baltimore and Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
	``The negotiations are going as expected,'' Angelos said as he  
arrived at the Latinamericano Stadium near Havana's Plaza of the 
Revolution. 
</P>
<P>
	During the game between the hometown Industriales and Villa  
Clara of Central Cuba, Angelos often chatted with Sandy Alderson, 
executive vice president of operations for major league baseball. 
</P>
<P>
	The delegation, seated behind home plate, could see a towering  
sign on the other side of the stadium that read ``Cuban Socialist 
Sports.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some delegation members passed out Orioles caps to their Cuban  
hosts. The Cubans reciprocated with posters of their national 
baseball series. 
</P>
<P>
	All around them, Cubans enjoyed the traditional Sunday afternoon  
outing, shouting for the Industriales, the former team of Orlando 
``El Duque'' Hernandez, who defected from the Caribbean nation to 
join the New York Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
	Fans munched on peanuts sold in paper cones or gulped thick,  
sweet thimble-sized doses of Cuban coffee sold in cups of folded 
butcher paper. Most of the little boys in the bleachers wore 
baseball caps or even miniature red and white striped uniforms 
emblazoned with ``Cuba'' and the number of their favorite player. 
</P>
<P>
	Passionate about the sport they call ``pelota,'' many Cubans  
said they would welcome a game between their Cuban stars and 
American players. 
</P>
<P>
	``This place would be full,'' said a baseball fan who gave his  
name only as Reynaldo, motioning around the 50,000-seat stadium 
attended by less than 10,000 fans on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Cubans will play with heart and soul. It would be the most  
important game here in I don't know how many years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Orioles' delegation met Saturday with Cuban sports  
officials. Delegation members and Cuban authorities reportedly have 
agreed to not publicly discuss negotiations until an announcement 
is made, perhaps Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Angelos hopes to arrange one game in Cuba and one at Camden  
Yards in Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton said he would let the Orioles play a Cuban  
team as part of a plan to increase relations between the American 
and Cuban people while maintaining the three-decade U.S. economic 
embargo against the communist nation. 
</P>
<P>
	The plan would let more Americans send money to Cubans, offer  
direct mail service between the two countries and expand direct 
charter flights. 
</P>
<P>
	The exhibition games, first proposed in 1996, were earlier  
rejected by the State Department because of the trade embargo. No 
major league team has played on the island since the Brooklyn 
Dodgers held spring training in Havana in 1947. 
</P>
<P>
	Now that the games have Clinton's backing, the State Department  
will require that any proceeds do not benefit the Cuban government. 
</P>
<P>
	The American preference is that any money go to Catholic Relief  
Services' Cuban counterpart, Caritas. Tom Garofalo, director of 
charity efforts in Cuba by the Baltimore-based Catholic Relief 
Services, is among those in the delegation. 
</P>
<P>
	Cuban authorities have said they would like to see proceeds  
benefit victims of Hurricane Mitch, which devastated a wide swath 
of Central America late last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Ricardo Alarcon, the speaker of Cuba's parliament, hinted a week  
ago that the Cuban government would allow a game, saying 
negotiations should address what kinds of bats -- wood or aluminum -- 
would be used. 
</P>
<P>
	Most Cubans, including President Fidel Castro, are avid baseball  
fans and an exhibition game on the island would receive wide public 
backing. 
</P>
<P>
	Cuban officials, however, may be leery of sending the country's  
best baseball players to the United States for a game because of 
the possibility of defections. 
</P>
<P>
	The last two times the Cuban national team played in the United  
States, a player defected and signed with a major league club.

<HEADLINE> Quotes on Senate Impeachment Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Comments from senators who appeared on the Sunday talk shows  
concerning the Senate impeachment trial of President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
                            	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	John Kyl, R-Ariz.: ``I also want to clear one other thing up --  
this isn't going to be a four or five-month trial if there are 
witnesses. I can't imagine more than a couple or three witnesses at 
most and perhaps a week in time.'' 

</P>
<P>
	Larry Craig, R-Idaho: ``You heard what some call good old street  
attorneys (the House managers) make one very strong case over the 
last several days. Now you're going to have the best attorneys 
money can buy (the president's attorneys) make another probably a 
very strong case. 

</P>
<P>
	Byron Dorgan, D-N.D.: ``I don't think there needs to be  
witnesses. Frankly, this is the most thoroughly investigated, 
widely reported scandal in history. We've sat for three days and 
haven't heard anything new.'' 

</P>
<P>
	Charles Schumer, D-N.Y.: ``Right now you can see a disagreement  
on witnesses beginning to pop up. But I think if we all act in a 
restrained and careful manner, we can avoid the acrimony.'' 

</P>
<P>
	Mitch McConnell, R-Ky.: ``There's been a lot of talk about after  
the impeachment trial is over the possibility of censure. No one's 
talking about that anymore, and we shouldn't be, because that has 
no place in the impeachment trial.'' 

</P>
<P>
	Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif.: ``I've learned one thing in my time  
in the United States Senate, what goes around comes around. And 
it's time to break that cycle.'' 

</P>
<P>
	Robert Torricelli, D-N.J.: ``I want to remind you that the House  
managers argued persuasively that the president's testimony in the 
Paula Jones deposition was in variance with the truth. I think they 
did an admirable job. Their problem is that the Paula Jones 
deposition is not before the Senate.'' 

</P>
<P>
	Pete Domenici, R-N.M.: ``If the prosecutors tell us they want  
these certain witnesses and why, we'll listen attentively and we'll 
vote. If because of that the president says I want these witnesses, 
and among them are Kenneth Starr, we'd like to know why. We still 
have to vote, and it has to be 51. 

</P>
<P>
	Christopher Dodd, D-Conn.: ``It is not an exaggeration if you go  
that route (calling witnesses), and you can make a case for it, we 
could be talking May or June before you finish this trial. And I 
think the Senate ought to think seriously before it goes that 
length of time.'' 

</P>
<P>
	Orrin Hatch, R-Utah: ``I think most people there, including some  
of my colleagues here on the other side, have indicated that the 
White House has a heavy burden of coming forward and rebutting some 
of the things that the House has done and presented.'' 

</P>
<P>
	Kay Bailey Hutchinson, R-Tex.: ``I do think what the status of  
sexual harassment laws in this country will be is going to be 
affected by this case and when I look at the equality of women; the 
ability for a woman in the workplace to have equal status, sexual 
harassment laws are an equalizer. 

</P>
<P>
	James Inhofe, R-Okla.: ``We had a very persuasive case before  
us, and ... I think it's important to note, that these House 
managers are first and foremost congressmen. They're attorneys but 
they haven't been in a courtroom, many of them, for a long, long 
time. I recognize that we're going to see, starting on Tuesday, the 
most experienced, prestigious, highly-compensated, expert lawyers 
anywhere in America.'' 

</P>
<P>
	John Kerry, D-Mass.: ``Whitewater to Travelgate to Filegate to  
this. Finally to the very thing that Henry Hyde said this is not 
about, he said this is not about private sexual matters. He said, 
that's none of our business. And yet, the very thing that the 
independent counsel bases this on, has everything to do with 
private matters.'' 

</P>
<P>
	Paul Wellstone, D-Minn.: ``If we go to witnesses, it'll be a  
spectacle, it'll go on and on, and the House members have nothing 
to lose. But the Senate has a lot to lose.'' 

</P>
<P>
	Tom Harkin, D-Iowa: ``We have to take into account not only  
facts and law, but the public good, history, what this will mean 
for the future, how it affects the country, how it affects our 
standing in the world. We have to weigh all of these things. Juries 
don't do that.'' 

</P>
<P>
	Patrick Leahy, D-Vt.:''Have you ever seen 100 senators sit  
quietly, attentively? I mean, nobody's in there signing their mail 
or anything else. They're actually paying attention.'' 

</P>
<P>
	Phil Gramm, R-Texas: ``We have had 15 impeachments by the House,  
we've had 15 trials, we rendered 15 verdicts. We've never compelled 
the accused to testify. So the president's not going to be 
compelled to testify.'' 

</P>
<P>
	Robert Bennett, R-Utah:'' (The trial) won't interfere with the  
business of the Senate at all.'' 

</P>
<P>
	Barbara Boxer, D-Calif.: ``To say that we can do business as  
usual, I just think it's wishful thinking.''

<HEADLINE> John Elway Couldn't Leave a Loser </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- He was not going to leave this place a loser.  
</P>
<P>
	Not for the last time. Not without a fight.  
</P>
<P>
	Not John Elway.  
</P>
<P>
	After wrestling with his emotions and questions about retirement  
all week, then being buffeted by swirling winds and the Jets' 
defense for a half, Elway turned as tough as the weather. He led 
the Broncos on four straight scoring drives in a 12-minute stretch 
of the third quarter Sunday to manufacture a 23-10 win in the AFC 
Championship. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither the comeback nor the stats were vintage Elway -- the  
first came way too early, the second were not worthy of a passer 
who has established himself as perhaps the NFL's best during the 
last 16 seasons. But by the end, retirement was still a question 
and not a demand. 
</P>
<P>
	``My main focus is to finish this year,'' Elway said, ``before l  
figure out the next one.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Judged by deed instead of word, he has most likely played his  
last game in Denver. He took a victory lap at the end of this one, 
rare for a player who treats praise the same way he does defensive 
lineman -- by scrambling. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was kind of unusual for him,'' Broncos coach Mike Shanahan  
said. ``I had to encourage him to do it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For most of the day, it looked like Elway wasn't going anywhere.  
Instead, he now goes on to Miami and the Super Bowl to face an 
Atlanta team coached by Dan Reeves. The same Dan Reeves who used to 
coach in Denver and fired Shanahan as his quarterback coach 
because, Reeves said, Shanahan and Elway were usurping his 
authority behind his back. 
</P>
<P>
	If so, neither one would say anything even mildly critical that  
would find its way back to him -- particularly on this day. 
</P>
<P>
	``At times,'' Shanahan said, ``we were best friends.''  
</P>
<P>
	``He's a great football coach,'' Elway said.  
</P>
<P>
	A moment later, someone asked Elway whether he hoped this would  
be the last time the Reeves-revenge angle is mentioned. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't wish for things that are not going to happen,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	All things considered, though, the questions could have been  
worse. 
</P>
<P>
		   Much worse.  
</P>
<P>
	As in last year's Super Bowl, Elway had sentiment going for him  
at the start and not much else. He was 0-for-his-first five throws. 
His receivers were dropping balls and the Jets defenders were 
knocking them down at the line of scrimmage. Even more dangerous, 
Elway's ineptitude spread through the rest of the offense like an 
infection. 
</P>
<P>
	The Broncos fumbled twice in the opening half. And they failed  
to punch it over the goal line on two runs late in the first 
quarter, first from the 6-yard line and then from the 1, just 
before Elway's pass on fourth down was knocked down by New York's 
Mo Lewis. 
</P>
<P>
	Things hardly improved in the second quarter. Elway was 4-for-14  
at the half for 25 net yards. The Jets' defensive schemes and winds 
that gusted to 32 mph and played havoc with his tosses weren't the 
only reasons for his funk. 
</P>
<P>
	``There were a lot of things going on the whole week and maybe  
that's part of the reason why we came out slow,'' he said. ``There 
was a lot of talk about everything but the football game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Elway's relationship with this town is no longer one of  
love-hate. After last season's Super Bowl win, he owns it, but 
Elway has certainly come in for his share of scrutiny. When he 
first arrived in Denver, newspapers breathlessly reported most of 
his comings and goings -- things like what and where he ate, how 
much, and how big a tip he left. They even reported what kind of 
candy the Elways handed out at Halloween. 
</P>
<P>
	It got so bad into his third season that while Elway's wife,  
Janet, was sitting in the stands not long after giving birth to 
their first child, a fan screamed, ``You can get your ... wife 
pregnant, but you can't ... do anything else, you bum.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She slapped him, and the family has managed to hold its own ever  
since. 
</P>
<P>
		   Elway, though, couldn't get a grip on this game until after the  
Jets went ahead 10-0 and the Broncos took over after the ensuing 
kickoff at their own 36. 
</P>
<P>
	They came out of the huddle in a run formation, hoping the Jets  
safeties would bite on a play-action fake so Elway could throw a 
long post pattern to Rod Smith. The only people who seemed 
confused, though, were Smith and tandem receiver Ed McCaffrey. Both 
lined up on the wrong side. 
</P>
<P>
	``Somehow,'' Elway said, ``they got word to each other and  
switched assignments.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He blushed, then added:  
</P>
<P>
	``They're bright guys, even though they came out of the huddle  
the wrong way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	No matter. Elway completed a 47-yard bomb to McCaffrey, and  
after Terrell Davis softened the Jets up by slashing for 6 yards, 
Elway drilled a pass to Howard Griffith slanting across the New 
York secondary for 11 yards and a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
	All of a sudden, Denver had its groove back. That drive consumed  
three plays and 1:38. None of the next three Denver scores, a 
touchdown and two Jason Elam line-drive field goals that bored 
through the wind, required more than eight plays or 3:14 to 
complete. 
</P>
<P>
	There wasn't much talk on the sideline up to that point about  
winning this one for Elway. Which is not to say that the Broncos 
didn't breathe easier. 
</P>
<P>
	``Awwww, we knew it wasn't going to be his last game,'' teammate  
Derek Loville said. ``His last game just had to be in Miami. 
</P>
<P>
	``And after that one,'' he added, ``we're going to try and talk  
him out of it.''

<HEADLINE> Public Not Getting Super Bowl Tix </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- The proof is there on page 6F, tucked between a  
bowling ad and a story on the 1968 Davis Cup match between Spain 
and South Africa. 
</P>
<P>
	``World Championship Football. Super Bowl. Jan. 14,'' the 3x6 ad  
says above an image of two players stretching for a pass. ``Tickets 
on sale for $6 and $8. Reserved seats at Orange Bowl Committee 
ticket office.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Surprising but true: When Miami was the site of its first Super  
Bowl 31 years ago, the NFL relied on newspaper ads to help sell 
tickets. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was totally unlike today,'' said Edwin Pope, longtime  
sports columnist for The Miami Herald, which ran the ad. ``Fans 
went to the games then. Now? Forget it, unless you're very rich.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There hasn't been a public sale of Super Bowl tickets in 25  
years. Prices have increased 50-fold at face value, perhaps five 
times that again on the resale market. Limousines and corporate 
hospitality tents dominate the scene. 
</P>
<P>
	The only way the average painted-chest, giant-foam-fingered  
diehard gets in these days is to hit the lottery or take out an ad. 
</P>
<P>
	``SUPER BOWL TICKETS WANTED (Needed) by fans, as many as 6.  
Please!'' reads one ad. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have a lot of major sporting events -- the World Cup, the  
Masters, the Final Four, but the Super Bowl is the big one that 
everybody wants to see,'' said Mark Halpern, a Fort Lauderdale 
ticket broker. 
</P>
<P>
	The inaugural Super Bowl attracted only 61,946 fans to the Los  
Angeles Coliseum in 1967, the event's only non-sellout. When the 
game moved to the Orange Bowl the following year, it still was a 
hard sell. 
</P>
<P>
	Most fans considered the AFL vastly inferior to the older NFL.  
Green Bay's demolition of Kansas City at Los Angeles did nothing to 
dispel that notion. 
</P>
<P>
	Miami Dolphins season-ticket holders could buy a Super Bowl  
ticket for every season ticket held. It still wasn't enough. 
</P>
<P>
	The NFL leaned on Miami businesses to help, with such entities  
as long-departed National Airlines receiving several tickets to use 
in promotions. 
</P>
<P>
	``We traveled to the site in October,'' said Don Weiss, the  
retired NFL executive director who organized the first 14 Super 
Bowls. ``We'd go around to the talk shows, hyping the game. It was 
a sell atmosphere in those days.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some 20,000 tickets went on public sale just before Thanksgiving  
1967. It took about a month to sell them all, Weiss said. 
</P>
<P>
	It was much the same when the Super Bowl returned to Miami the  
following year. That was when Joe Namath changed perceptions of the 
game. 
</P>
<P>
	Three days before Namath's New York Jets faced the heavily  
favored Baltimore Colts, the brash quarterback guaranteed a win. 
</P>
<P>
	The Jets won 16-7. And when Kansas City beat Minnesota the  
following year, it established the AFL -- soon to be the AFC -- as an 
equal. Within a few years, the Super Bowl changed dramatically. 
</P>
<P>
	The last public sale of Super Bowl tickets was for the 1971 game  
at Miami. The practice of offering season-ticket holders in the 
host city a one-for-one deal ended in 1972. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, the NFL has very specific percentages for ticket  
allocation. The league keeps 25.3 percent -- about 15,000 tickets 
this year -- for its use, with about two-thirds of those going to 
sponsors, advertisers and the TV network showing the game. 
</P>
<P>
	Each of the participating teams gets 17.5 percent of the  
tickets. The host team receives 10 percent and each of the other 27 
teams gets 1.1 percent. When club officials meet their needs for 
staff and business associates, the rest -- usually about half -- go 
into a lottery for season-ticket holders. 
</P>
<P>
	``You wind up making a lot of people unhappy,'' Dolphins  
president Eddie Jones said. ``People don't understand why they 
don't win. But that's what a lottery is.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For the desperate, there are the ticket brokers. But be prepared  
for a huge markup -- the going rate last week was $1,750 for an 
upper end-zone seat, without even knowing the participants. 
</P>
<P>
	It's illegal in Florida to buy or sell tickets for more than $1  
above face value. So Halpern's Front &AMP; Center Entertainment sells 
them as part of a package that includes programs, souvenirs and 
other perks. 
</P>
<P>
	Super Bowl ticket scarcity can be stressful for brokers. For  
last year's game at San Diego, Halpern contracted to sell some 
seats for $1,200, then had to shell out $2,000 to acquire the 
seats. 
</P>
<P>
	``You just bite the bullet and pay more money,'' said Halpern,  
who wouldn't divulge how much he lost. ``You take the hit and take 
care of your customers.''

<HEADLINE> McGwire Ball Brings Record Price </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The ball looks rather ordinary, really. There's a smudge here,  
probably where it was struck by Mark McGwire's bat, and a nick 
there, possibly from its collision with the metal bleachers at 
Busch Stadium before it landed at Philip Ozersky's feet. 
</P>
<P>
	What makes this particular ball extraordinary is the $2.7  
million an anonymous bidder paid for it at Guernsey's baseball 
auction. Add the $305,000 buyer's commission and the total price is 
over $3 million. 
</P>
<P>
	And that's without McGwire's autograph.  
</P>
<P>
	Ozersky, a bright, 26-year-old research scientist working on a  
human gene project at Washington University in St. Louis, 
recognized the absurdity of it all. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's pretty inconceivable,'' he said, shrugging his shoulders.  
``I went to a Cardinals game to have some fun with my friends and 
this happened.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Did the price exceed his expectations?  
</P>
<P>
	``Oh, yeah,'' Ozersky exclaimed. ``The sky's the limit, and I  
found out what the sky was.'' 
</P>
<P>
	What is it Don King always says? Only in America.  
</P>
<P>
	Later in the auction last Tuesday, Guernsey's offered the 755th  
home run ball hit by Hank Aaron, significant because it was the 
last one struck by baseball's home run king. It was a struggle to 
get the bidding to $800,000 and when auctioneer JoAnne Carter 
couldn't attract any more than that, the item was withdrawn because 
it had not reached its unannounced minimum price. 
</P>
<P>
	Now understand, McGwire almost certainly will hit more home runs  
and Aaron will not. Yet Carter had no trouble pushing the price of 
No. 70 into the stratosphere, the cost jumping in $100,000 
increments, while No. 755 drew a ho-hum from the high rollers who 
came with their checkbooks. 
</P>
<P>
	More puzzling is that two months ago the first home run ball  
Babe Ruth hit in Yankee Stadium sold for a mere $126,500, chump 
change by comparison. 
</P>
<P>
	And Ruth even signed it.  
</P>
<P>
	``What happened with the McGwire ball was incredible,'' said  
Joshua Evans, who runs Leland's Auction House and sold the Ruth 
ball. ``It makes sense because this is an amazing piece. It's 
probably the most significant home run ever hit and never has it 
been so timely for it to be sold.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Right now, McGwire is baseball's marquee name and Ruth is out of  
the game's distant past. It is the same, Evans said, as the 
difference between the price of Michael Jordan memorabilia and Wilt 
Chamberlain's. 
</P>
<P>
	``This ball is the only piece that people will pay to see,''  
Evans said. ``Look at the response it got. The ball went for what 
it should have gone for.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The whole Guernsey's affair had a surrealistic feel about it.  
The Madison Square Garden gallery cheered loudly, like a ballpark 
crowd rooting for a rally, as the price soared for the McGwire 
ball. 
</P>
<P>
	After the price hit $1.6 million, just two bidders remained: the  
faceless voice on the telephone and Irwin Sternberg, a New York 
businessman. There was a gasp from the crowd when the $2 million 
plateau was reached. 
</P>
<P>
	Sternberg blinked at $2.6 million and later said he was sorry  
that he had not stayed in the chase. He came away with a 
consolation prize, a ball signed by Ruth and Roger Maris, previous 
holders of the home run record, that he purchased for $60,000. 
</P>
<P>
	There was some booing when Arlan Ettinger, president of the  
auction house, withdrew one of the other prize lots -- Mickey 
Mantle's 500th home run -- because of a question of authenticity. It 
was as if the crowd wasn't concerned with that little detail. They 
were ready to bid anyway. 
</P>
<P>
	Other McGwire balls went for less glitzy prices. No. 63, No. 67  
and No. 68 sold for $50,000 each. And No. 16 -- a ball that sailed 
545 feet for his longest homer of the season -- went for a mere 
$20,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Go figure.  
</P>
<P>
	Then there was the matter of Sammy Sosa, McGwire's partner in  
the season-long home run chase. No. 66, his last of the season, 
fetched $150,000, but some of his other homers were received less 
enthusiastically. No. 64 went for $24,000 and No. 61 went for a 
bargain basement $15,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Hey, at that price, Ernie Banks might have said let's buy two.

<HEADLINE> Super Bowl Is One of Many Matchups </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Dan Reeves hired Mike Shanahan. Dan Reeves  
fired Mike Shanahan (or at least they came to a parting of the 
ways). 
</P>
<P>
	And many people think Reeves was fired by Denver after the 1992  
season because of a rift with John Elway. 
</P>
<P>
	In two weeks, Reeves takes his upstart Atlanta Falcons to the  
Super Bowl to meet up with Shanahan, Elway and the defending 
champion Broncos, who beat the New York Jets 23-10 Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Like the Minnesota Vikings, whom the Falcons upset 30-27 in  
overtime Sunday, Denver is heavy favorite -- the line opened at 8 1/2 
points. 
</P>
<P>
	But forget for a minute who might win.  
</P>
<P>
	The real drama here is Reeves, who underwent quadruple heart  
bypass surgery just a month ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I can stand today, my heart's got to be in great shape,''  
Reeves said after the win over the Vikings. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's incredible when you think about it,'' added Reeves, who  
took over a team that was 3-13 in 1996 and began 1-7 last season. 
``Coming from 1-7 halfway through your first year, to be in the 
Super Bowl your third year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reeves is no stranger to Super Bowls -- this will be his ninth  
appearance in the 33 games. He made it as a player with the Cowboys 
and an assistant coach with the Cowboys before losing three times 
as head coach of the Broncos. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, he faces Shanahan, fired by Reeves as offensive coordinator  
in 1992 because Reeves thought Shanahan had taken some power and 
was too influential with Elway. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll be honest,'' Shanahan said after he coached the Broncos  
to their second straight Super Bowl. ``We were best friends.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Elway later said playing for Reeves was ``hell'' when the coach  
was fired after the '92 season. 
</P>
<P>
	As for other matchups Jan. 31 in Miami:  
</P>
<P>
	-- Elway will attract almost all of the attention when it comes  
to quarterbacks. He's expected to retire after the game, ending a 
Hall of Fame career. 
</P>
<P>
	Atlanta's Chris Chandler is with his sixth team in 11 NFL  
seasons and had never been in a playoff game until a week ago. But 
he was downright Elwayesque on Sunday, directing an eight-play, 
71-yard drive to tie the Vikings with 49 seconds left in the fourth 
quarter and directing a 70-yarder that set up Morten Andersen's 
winning field goal. 
</P>
<P>
	-- The Broncos bring NFL MVP Terrell Davis, only the fourth  
2,000-yard rusher in league history and MVP of last year's Super 
Bowl. But Jamal Anderson of the Falcons rushed for 1,846 yards, 
just 152 fewer than Davis. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Atlanta's scrappy defense stopped a Vikings team that set an  
NFL record with 556 points during the regular season, and did it at 
the Metrodome. If the Falcons can repeat that performance on a 
neutral field, they will have a chance against Denver. 
</P>
<P>
	But the matchup everyone will be talking about in the two-week  
buildup will be Reeves vs. Shanahan and Elway. 
</P>
<P>
	Reeves will have a lot of motivation against a team that fired  
him after he led them to three Super Bowls. 
</P>
<P>
	He'll say all the right things about Elway and Shanahan. And  
Elway and Shanahan will say all the right things about Reeves. 
</P>
<P>
	But deep down?  
</P>
<P>
	We all know, don't we?

<HEADLINE> Famed Vermont Family Wins in Court </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MONTPELIER, Vt. (AP) -- A $3 million dispute among the family  
immortalized in ``The Sound of Music'' was settled in the Vermont 
Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
	The court ruled Friday that the Trapp Family Lodge Inc., founded  
by Maria von Trapp in 1962 to bring the family's financial holdings 
together, must pay dissenting shareholders $3 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision capped a battle that started after the 1987 death  
of Maria von Trapp, played by Julie Andrews in the 1965 movie. The 
dispute grew in the mid-1990s when her youngest child, Johannes, 
who headed the corporation running the lodge, re-organized it. 
</P>
<P>
	Minority shareholders, including his sister and the children of  
two brothers, objected and cashed in their shares. 
</P>
<P>
	The price paid for those shares was at the center of the court  
battle. The difference in the price paid and the amount sought was 
about $2.2 million, plus interest, totaling about $3 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're very pleased with the ruling and very happy that perhaps  
this whole issue has now come to a conclusion,'' said George von 
Trapp, one of about 17 shareholders seeking additional payment. 
</P>
<P>
	Johannes von Trapp said the ruling was ``just another in a long  
line of essentially business-unfriendly decisions in Vermont.'' He 
said he is considering appealing to federal court or asking for 
re-argument before the state Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
	The family's holdings include the Trapp Family Lodge hotel,  
2,200 acres of land in Stowe, and some of the royalties to ``The 
Sound of Music.''

<HEADLINE>  Canucks Trade Bure to Florida </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SUNRISE, Fla. (AP) -- High-scoring, high-priced holdout Pavel  
Bure, who told the Vancouver Canucks he would never play for them 
again, got his wish Sunday when he was sent to the Florida Panthers 
in a seven-player deal. 
</P>
<P>
	The three-time 50-goal scorer, who has spent the entire season  
at his home in Moscow, will join the Panthers in New York for games 
Wednesday against the Islanders and Thursday against the Rangers. 
</P>
<P>
	``He can lift people out of their seats with his speed and  
flash,'' Panthers general manager Bryan Murray said. ``We're also 
confident he'll lift the play of some of our younger players.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Canucks also sent defensemen Bret Hedican and Brad Ference  
to Florida for defenseman Ed Jovanovski, centers Dave Gagner and 
Mike Brown and holdout goaltender Kevin Weekes. 
</P>
<P>
	The Panthers also will send a first-round draft choice to  
Vancouver in either 1999 or 2000. At that time, the Panthers will 
get a third-round pick from Vancouver. 
</P>
<P>
	Bure, 27, is a four-time all-star who immediately gives Florida  
its most electrifying scorer since it joined the NHL six years ago. 
No Panther has scored more than 32 goals in a season, by Scott 
Mellanby in 1995-96 and Ray Whitney last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's nothing like shooting the puck on goal,'' Panthers  
coach Terry Murray said. ``He has the opportunity to be a threat 
every time he's on the ice. I hope he'll also have an effect on 
some of our other players.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Whitney has been the Panthers' top scorer this season with 14  
goals. Only eight teams have scored fewer than Florida's 103 goals. 
</P>
<P>
	Terry Murray said he would start Bure on the right wing with  
center Viktor Kozlov, a fellow Russian. The possibility of an 
all-Russian line with Bure, Kozlov and rookie Oleg Kvasha also 
intrigues him. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's something I'm interested in seeing myself,'' the coach  
said. ``If Kozlov and Kvasha can step up to the next level, I think 
it'll be a dynamite line.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bure won the 1992 Calder Trophy as the NHL's rookie of the year,  
scoring 34 goals in 60 games. He followed that with consecutive 
60-goal seasons, leading the Canucks to the 1994 Stanley Cup finals 
with 16 postseason goals in 24 games. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russian star scored 51 goals last season, one off the league  
lead. But he demanded a trade during the offseason, citing personal 
reasons. 
</P>
<P>
	``He said management and the organization had not backed him up  
in the past,'' Canucks president Brian Burke said. ``He also did 
not like the fish-bowl effect here in Vancouver. Those were the 
reasons he gave me. As I said to our fans, I don't think anyone 
listening to those reasons at this point will conclude that they 
add up to a refusal to play in Vancouver.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bure has also been frustrated by contract squabbles he's had  
since signing his last deal with the Canucks in 1994. He is in the 
last season of a five-year deal that would reportedly pay him about 
$8 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Bryan Murray said he's already had preliminary talks with Bure's  
agent, Mike Gillis, about a contract extension. He expects 
something to be done before the end of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wouldn't trade for a player I anticipate having any problems  
with. I can tell you that,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Amid swirling speculation of an impending trade last week, Burke  
had said he would trade Bure by Monday or hold off until the March 
23 trading deadline. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've beaten this thing to death,'' Burke said. ``This has  
involved shopping trips to try and jack the value up. Trading a 
player like this is not easy. ... If I thought I could've received 
a better deal, I would've waited.'' 
</P>

<HEADLINE>  Canucks Trade Bure to Florida </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SUNRISE, Fla. (AP) -- High-scoring, high-priced holdout Pavel  
Bure, who told the Vancouver Canucks he would never play for them 
again, got his wish Sunday when he was sent to the Florida Panthers 
in a seven-player deal. 
</P>
<P>
	The three-time 50-goal scorer, who has spent the entire season  
at his home in Moscow, will join the Panthers in New York for games 
Wednesday against the Islanders and Thursday against the Rangers. 
</P>
<P>
	``He can lift people out of their seats with his speed and  
flash,'' Panthers general manager Bryan Murray said. ``We're also 
confident he'll lift the play of some of our younger players.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Canucks also sent defensemen Bret Hedican and Brad Ference  
to Florida for defenseman Ed Jovanovski, centers Dave Gagner and 
Mike Brown and holdout goaltender Kevin Weekes. 
</P>
<P>
	The Panthers also will send a first-round draft choice to  
Vancouver in either 1999 or 2000. At that time, the Panthers will 
get a third-round pick from Vancouver. 
</P>
<P>
	Bure, 27, is a four-time all-star who immediately gives Florida  
its most electrifying scorer since it joined the NHL six years ago. 
No Panther has scored more than 32 goals in a season, by Scott 
Mellanby in 1995-96 and Ray Whitney last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's nothing like shooting the puck on goal,'' Panthers  
coach Terry Murray said. ``He has the opportunity to be a threat 
every time he's on the ice. I hope he'll also have an effect on 
some of our other players.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Whitney has been the Panthers' top scorer this season with 14  
goals. Only eight teams have scored fewer than Florida's 103 goals. 
</P>
<P>
	Terry Murray said he would start Bure on the right wing with  
center Viktor Kozlov, a fellow Russian. The possibility of an 
all-Russian line with Bure, Kozlov and rookie Oleg Kvasha also 
intrigues him. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's something I'm interested in seeing myself,'' the coach  
said. ``If Kozlov and Kvasha can step up to the next level, I think 
it'll be a dynamite line.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bure won the 1992 Calder Trophy as the NHL's rookie of the year,  
scoring 34 goals in 60 games. He followed that with consecutive 
60-goal seasons, leading the Canucks to the 1994 Stanley Cup finals 
with 16 postseason goals in 24 games. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russian star scored 51 goals last season, one off the league  
lead. But he demanded a trade during the offseason, citing personal 
reasons. 
</P>
<P>
	``He said management and the organization had not backed him up  
in the past,'' Canucks president Brian Burke said. ``He also did 
not like the fish-bowl effect here in Vancouver. Those were the 
reasons he gave me. As I said to our fans, I don't think anyone 
listening to those reasons at this point will conclude that they 
add up to a refusal to play in Vancouver.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bure has also been frustrated by contract squabbles he's had  
since signing his last deal with the Canucks in 1994. He is in the 
last season of a five-year deal that would reportedly pay him about 
$8 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Bryan Murray said he's already had preliminary talks with Bure's  
agent, Mike Gillis, about a contract extension. He expects 
something to be done before the end of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wouldn't trade for a player I anticipate having any problems  
with. I can tell you that,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Amid swirling speculation of an impending trade last week, Burke  
had said he would trade Bure by Monday or hold off until the March 
23 trading deadline. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've beaten this thing to death,'' Burke said. ``This has  
involved shopping trips to try and jack the value up. Trading a 
player like this is not easy. ... If I thought I could've received 
a better deal, I would've waited.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jovanovski, 22, has been a defensive mainstay since Florida took  
him with the No. 1 pick of the 1994 draft. He had three goals and 
13 assists this season, recently playing some of the best hockey of 
his career. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm excited,'' Jovanovski said. ``I'm looking forward to the  
opportunity to play with one of the best players in the game, with

<HEADLINE> 3 Cities Offer To Hold 2002 Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) -- Three European cities -- Innsbruck,  
Austria; Ostersund, Sweden; and Lillehammer, Norway -- have offered 
to hold the 2002 Olympics if Salt Lake City is unable to because of 
the widening bribery scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	IOC director-general Francois Carrard said in the SonntagsBlick  
newspaper Sunday the three cities have made official proposals. 
However, he stressed the IOC is intent on keeping the Winter Games 
in Salt Lake. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no way the IOC wants to do that,'' he said when asked  
if the IOC would switch venues. 
</P>
<P>
	He added that the three European proposals show the ``enthusiasm  
for hosting the games is as big as ever despite the current 
problems.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Winter Games were in Innsbruck in 1964 and 1976 and in  
Lillehammer in 1994. Ostersund was among the losing bidders for the 
2002 Games. 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview with another Swiss newspaper Saturday, IOC  
president Juan Antonio Samaranch hinted his organization might help 
Salt Lake organizers cope with any financial shortfall resulting 
from the corruption scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	``It depends on what help Salt Lake City wants. We will find a  
solution,'' he told the newspaper Le Temps. 
</P>
<P>
	``We continue to support the Games of Salt Lake City. For me  
there is no alternative.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC executive board meets next weekend to consider the  
results of an inquiry into cash payments, scholarships, free 
medical care and other favors accepted during the course of Salt 
Lake City's successful bid for the 2002 Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch has said nine IOC members risk expulsion and four face  
lesser sanctions.

<HEADLINE> Pryor Still Cracking Jokes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- He's confined to a wheelchair by multiple  
sclerosis and is virtually unable to utter anything longer than a 
sentence. But Richard Pryor can still crack jokes. 
</P>
<P>
	Pryor, who was profiled in Sunday's New York Times Magazine,  
celebrated his 58th birthday at a party in December with friends 
like Damon Wayans, Morgan Freeman and Samuel L. Jackson. He had 
these droll observations: 
</P>
<P>
	-- On being honored for his contributions to the genre of comedy  
with a prize named for Mark Twain: ``I didn't know him 
personally.'' 
</P>
<P>
	-- What he considers the most surprising thing in America today:  
``That I'm not in the graveyard.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The presentation of the Twain Prize to Pryor, which took place  
earlier this month at the Kennedy Center in Washington, will be 
broadcast Wednesday on Comedy Central. 
</P>
<P>
	Proceeds from the show will go to a scholarship fund for young  
comedians.

<HEADLINE> Economy Hasn't Let Bulls Down / Ticker Talk  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- While stock and bond investors have plenty of  
other things to worry about, you won't hear many complaints on Wall 
Street about the recent progress of the U.S. economy. 
</P>
<P>
	The news on two key gauges of the nation's economic health --  
employment and inflation -- has lately been about as good as anyone 
could have hoped. 
</P>
<P>
	Even as the rumblings of international money woes continue with  
last week's currency devaluation in Brazil, the great expansion of 
the 1990s in this country appears to have lost none of its 
vitality. 
</P>
<P>
	``In an incredible display of resilience, the U.S. economy has  
blithely shrugged off the dangers that arose from last summer's 
market turmoil,'' says David Resler, chief economist at Nomura 
Securities International. ``At 93 months and counting, the 
expansion is the longest peacetime stretch of economic growth. 
</P>
<P>
	``Employment is growing faster than nearly everyone expected.  
The U.S. economy appears to have somehow locked into a virtuous 
cycle in which strong employment begets strong spending which 
brings further job gains. 
</P>
<P>
	``Strong jobs growth has been accompanied by strong gains in  
productivity,'' Resler adds. ``There's little sign that strong 
demand for labor and for goods has increased inflation pressures.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Indeed, the latest statistics on inflation, like the most recent  
employment numbers, are the best the country has seen since the 
1960s. 
</P>
<P>
	In those days, most economists agree, business conditions drew  
some artificial and fleeting benefits from the Vietnam War. Today, 
they say, the expansion seems not to rely on any such extraordinary 
stimulus. 
</P>
<P>
	``The current economic expansion is just four quarters short of  
the long-held record of the 1960s,'' says Gail Fosler, chief 
economist at the Conference Board, a business research group in New 
York. ``At a time when interest rates and unemployment are at their 
lowest in 30 years, it is likely that this expansion will set new 
records.'' 
</P>
<P>
	All this helps explain, analysts say, why stock prices have been  
able to rebound so powerfully and so quickly from last year's 
90-day-wonder bear market. 
</P>
<P>
	``What's up now in the market? Pretty much everything,'' says  
Stephen Quickel in his newsletter U.S. Investment Report. ``The 
rebound from last summer's collapse in prices still seems amazing, 
though not entirely surprising.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Stocks are being driven by strong underlying fundamentals,''  
Quickel says. But he also observes, ``Lots of problems still lurk 
out there. The most immediate threats are excessive valuations in 
certain sectors, ranging from the Internet crazies to big 
industrial stocks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With stock prices as high as they are, many observers caution,  
the market remains vulnerable to disappointments. 
</P>
<P>
	It may not be enough, the doubters say, for the news on the  
economy to stay good. It may well have to continue producing 
favorable surprises to keep the markets as happy as they have been 
lately. 
</P>
<P>
	For instance, says Bob Prince at the investment firm of  
Bridgewater Associates, investors now appear to be expecting U.S. 
inflation to run at less than 1 percent a year over the next 10 
years. That kind of expectation doesn't leave a great deal of 
margin for error. 
</P>
<P>
	Even when not much seems to be happening on the inflation front,  
many analysts say it remains a prime concern for the stock market. 
</P>
<P>
	Says Quickel: ``Some of us with a little gray around the temples  
recall how inflation deflated stocks from the middle '60s into the 
early '80s, when the Dow struggled for 17 years to break through 
1,000.'' Today, he says, ``prolonged moderate inflation is in many 
ways the stock market's best friend.''

<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Are you a Yankee Doodle Dandy, as the old  
George M. Cohan song goes, ``born on the Fourth of July''? 
</P>
<P>
	Philadelphia's city officials are looking for 100 people born on  
that date for a birthday gathering to honor the nation. And to 
bring the city a little publicity. 
</P>
<P>
	Organizers of Millennium Philadelphia want one person for each  
year from 1900 through 1999, and at least one from each state. Each 
will get a trip for two to Philadelphia, where they'll line up 
outside Independence Hall on July 4, 2000, for what organizers are 
calling ``The Photo of the Century.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Can you imagine what an honor that would be,'' said Frank J.  
Castelli, born July 4, 1925, of Ebensburg. ``To honor our 
country?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Each Dandy also gets a two-night hotel stay, parties, presents,  
sightseeing, and a place in Philadelphia's July 4 parade. 
</P>
<P>
	As of Friday, 223 people from 26 states have signed up.  
</P>
<P>
	About 760,000 of the more than 270 million Americans were born  
on July 4, based on an unofficial estimate drawn up for Millennium 
Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
	William J. Schlosky, born in 1906, is the oldest applicant so  
far. He will be 93 come July. ``My mother said I came out with a 
bang,'' Schlosky said.

<HEADLINE> NCAA Handed Another Legal Setback </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KANSAS CITY, Kan. (AP) -- The $67 million judgment a federal jury  
ordered the NCAA to pay to a group of entry-level coaches last May 
has jumped to nearly $74.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Counting interest and lawyer fees, the total price tag for the  
NCAA's ill-fated attempt to force certain coaches to accept 
$16,000-a-year salaries is now approaching $90 million. 
</P>
<P>
	It's the largest financial penalty ever levied against the NCAA  
and threatens to become an explosive political issue among big-time 
schools over where to pin blame and how to share financial pain. 
</P>
<P>
	In the latest turn in the five-year-old legal wrangle, U.S.  
District Court Judge Kathryn Vratil informed both sides late Friday 
that she had ruled against the NCAA's motion for a new trial and 
granted the coaches' motion to add an inflation adjustment to the 
$67 million figure. 
</P>
<P>
	``We asked the court to adjust the judgment to 1998 dollars,  
which brings it to more than $74 million,'' Dennis Cross, one of 
the plaintiffs' lead attorneys, told The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	The next step, unless a settlement is reached, will be the  
NCAA's appealing the award. But pursuing an appeal might cause 
serious damage to the credibility of the organization that is quick 
to punish athletes for violating its rules. 
</P>
<P>
	During the trial last May, a main argument by the NCAA's own  
lawyers was that the restricted earnings coaches were not due a 
large award because many Division I schools had actually ``gotten 
around'' the rule by funneling inflated and under-the-table 
payments to them. 
</P>
<P>
	While admitting that schools and some booster clubs had arranged  
to improperly augment the salaries, NCAA lawyers listed several 
big-time institutions by name, including Arkansas, Georgetown and 
Syracuse, whose president, Kenneth Shaw, was head of the 
policy-making NCAA board of directors at the time. Under 
questioning, the NCAA admitted its enforcement department had not 
pursued any of those cases. 
</P>
<P>
	In the meantime, interest of more than $300,000 a month is  
accruing on the judgment and the NCAA is liable for legal fees for 
both sides, which have been estimated at around $14 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're at least glad the motions have been ruled on and now the  
appeal process can get under way,'' Wally Renfro, the NCAA's 
director of public relations, said on Saturday. ``Beyond that, 
there's not much I can say.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A negotiated settlement remains possible, although the two sides  
have never been close. 
</P>
<P>
	``Way back when the case began, they could have settled  
cheaply,'' Cross said. ``But everything that's happened since has 
caused the settlement to go up, not to mention the accumulating of 
interest.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The brainchild of a group of university presidents, the  
restricted earnings rule was adopted as a cost-cutting move by 
near-unanimous vote of Division I schools in 1991 and capped 
salaries for assistants in various sports at $12,000 for the 
academic year and $4,000 for the summer. 
</P>
<P>
	The rule was finally lifted in 1995 after the courts found the  
NCAA in violation of antitrust law. 
</P>
<P>
	Last fall, the NCAA was offering $44 million and the coaches  
were demanding $60 million as a settlement. 
</P>
<P>
	``The $60 million offer is no longer on the table,'' Cross said.  
``We have not talked with them about a settlement since November.''

<HEADLINE> Inspector Hopes To Nab Smugglers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) -- Nick Porzio knew something wasn't right  
when he saw the avocados. None had a label stating its origin, a 
violation of Florida law. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Agriculture Department inspector returned to the  
supermarket days later and found another load of Hass avocados. 
These 67 pieces of fruit were infected with parasite and each bore 
labels showing they'd been shipped from Mexico, a violation of 
federal law. 
</P>
<P>
	Porzio jumped on the avocado trail to try to choke off the path  
used to bring the illegal fruit to market. His suspicions resulted 
in searches at four produce distributorships and the launch of a 
multi-state smuggling investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want the big fish, not the little guys,'' said Porzio, a  
17-year USDA veteran. 
</P>
<P>
	At risk is Florida's $6.1 billion agricultural industry, which  
in the last two years has been threatened by Mediterranean fruit 
flies and citrus canker, both likely carried in by illicit fruits 
or vegetables. 
</P>
<P>
	Citrus canker forms lesions on fruits, causing them to drop from  
trees. Medflies burrow into fruit to deposit their larvae, and the 
fruit eventually rots. 
</P>
<P>
	Florida, with its subtropical climate and proximity to the  
Caribbean, is perhaps the most vulnerable state in the nation to 
exotic pests that arrive by smugglers. 
</P>
<P>
	For most of this century, Mexican avocados have been banned in  
the United States because of concerns they carried the avocado seed 
weevil. 
</P>
<P>
	After repeated requests from the Mexican government, the USDA  
decided two years ago to allow the sale of Mexican avocados, but 
only in 19 northern states and only during winter months on the 
theory that the cold would prevent any infestation. 
</P>
<P>
	In December, the USDA issued an alert that the imported avocados  
were moving out of the approved states. 
</P>
<P>
	Porzio found them at a market owned by a grocery chain with  
almost 100 stores in 21 states and revenues of $1.38 billion last 
year. Because the investigation opened only last week, Porzio asked 
that the store's name not be used. 
</P>
<P>
	The supermarket manager produced invoices showing he got his  
produce from four distributors -- two in Orlando, one in Winter 
Haven and the fourth in North Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
	Porzio headed to Harvill's Produce Co., one of the Orlando  
distributors. He had to act quickly since produce sells quickly and 
the supermarket's manager would have notified his distributors to 
expect the inspectors. 
</P>
<P>
	As a result of the recent infestations, USDA inspectors have  
teamed up with state inspectors to carry out their sweeps. Leslie 
Wilber, an inspector with the Florida Department of Agriculture, 
accompanied Porzio. 
</P>
<P>
	Mark Harvill, the owner's son, told the inspectors his fruit  
came from California, and the two found nothing amiss. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't sell Mexican avocados,'' Harvill told Porzio. ``Good  
luck on the chase, buddy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Strike one.  
</P>
<P>
	Next stop -- Red's Market Wholesale Produce, the second Orlando  
distributor. Porzio and Ms. Wilber again searched crates and again 
found no Mexican avocados. 
</P>
<P>
	Strike two.  
</P>
<P>
	Porzio then called another USDA inspector who reported nothing  
wrong at the Winter Haven distributor. 
</P>
<P>
	Strike three.  
</P>
<P>
	``It takes time for it to pay off,'' Porzio said. And it finally  
did. 
</P>
<P>
	USDA agents uncovered boxes of contraband avocados at the  
grocery chain's distributor in North Carolina. An investigation is 
continuing and authorities would not name the distributor. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every now and then you get a hot one,'' Porzio said. ``This is  
a hot one.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton Seeks Child Care Credit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton's fiscal 2000 budget will  
propose a $500 child care tax credit for stay-at-home parents, an 
idea pushed last year by congressional Republicans, administrations 
sources said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's proposal would allow a tax credit of up to $500 for  
families with a child aged 1 or younger, according to a White House 
official who spoke on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	The sliding-scale credit, pegged to family income, is expected  
to cost $1.3 billion over five years, allowing for an average tax 
credit of $178, the official said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton is expected to outline the proposal in his State of the  
Union address Tuesday night before a joint session of Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	The tax credit is expected to benefit 1.7 million families. A  
family earning $30,000 per year with one working parent would be 
able to claim the full $500 in child care expenses, rather than the 
$250 they are allowed under current law. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposal is part of a larger child care package that seeks a  
total of $18 billion over five years to aid working poor and middle 
class families. 
</P>
<P>
	That broader package -- absent the stay-at-home-mom credit -- is  
similar to what Clinton sought last year: $7.5 billion for 
expanding child care subsidies to serve an extra 1.15 million 
children; $5 billion in tax credits for non-parental care of a 
child younger than 13, or a disabled dependent or spouse; $3 
billion for grants for preschool programs; a $500 million tax 
credit for businesses that provide child care services for their 
employees; $600 million for after-school programs and $173 million 
for inspections, training and other efforts to improve child care. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, Clinton put forth a $22 billion proposal, tied to  
revenue from the proposed tobacco settlement, but it went nowhere 
on Capitol Hill, in part because Republicans said it failed to 
address parents who do not work outside the home. 
</P>
<P>
	With the revamped plan, the White House was hoping to take some  
steam out of that argument, giving GOP leaders what amounts to a 
political dare. ``There's no excuse for Congress not acting on 
child care now,'' the official said. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the official declined to reveal how the tax credit  
would be financed, other than to say it would be through ``a host 
of options'' being exercised in Clinton's budget and would not be 
tied to a tobacco tax increase. 
</P>
<P>
	White House officials said Clinton's specific tax credit for  
stay-at-home parents is patterned after one offered last year by 
Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn. The rest of Clinton's package 
incorporates elements of a Senate proposal offered by Sens. Orrin 
Hatch and John Chafee, they said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Chafee-Hatch bill called for $15 billion to $16 billion over  
five years, including a dependent-care tax credit for stay-at-home 
parents of up to $900 per year per family.

<HEADLINE> Austrian Raich Wins Slalom </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WENGEN, Switzerland (AP) -- Austria's newest golden boy, Benjamin  
Raich, won a men's slalom Sunday for his third triumph of his 
rookie season on the World Cup circuit. 
</P>
<P>
	Raich began his surprising run 10 days ago, winning a night  
slalom, then defeated teammate and double Olympic champion Hermann 
Maier on home snow. 
</P>
<P>
	Before then, Raich had only an eighth place from the opening  
giant slalom in October to show for his early season efforts. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have to believe in the start hut you can win,'' said  
Raich, the newest member of an already deep Austrian team. ``It's a 
question of attitude. Pressure is only as big as you let it be.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The victory virtually guaranteed Raich a berth on the Austrian  
team in one of the technical events at the World Championships at 
Vail, Colo., beginning Jan. 30. 
</P>
<P>
	Raich displayed the steely nerves of a veteran, recording the  
fastest two-run aggregate time of 1 minute, 41.40 seconds, .10 
seconds quicker than his closest rival, Michael Von Gruenigen of 
Switzerland. 
</P>
<P>
	Raich defeated World Cup champion Maier in a giant slalom a week  
ago at Flachau -- where Maier learned to ski -- after winning the 
night slalom at Schladming only three days earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	The five-time world junior champion appeared poised for a third  
straight victory last Tuesday at Adelboden, Switzerland, leading 
after the opening run before dropping to third. 
</P>
<P>
	Von Gruenigen, a favorite of the home fans, was a bittersweet  
second in 1:41.50. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I saw I was only .10 behind the winner my heart sank, but  
I'm still very happy because it's home for me,'' said Von 
Gruenigen, the giant slalom world champion who never has won a 
slalom. 
</P>
<P>
	The winner of Saturday's downhill, 1996 overall World Cup  
champion Lasse Kjus, placed third in the slalom, at 1:41.94. The 
result gave the Norwegian the win in the weekend's combined event. 
</P>
<P>
	Bode Miller of Franconia, N.H., recorded his career best result,  
finishing fourth at 1:42.38. 
</P>
<P>
	Fifty-fourth out of the start hut, Miller finished the opening  
run in 13th place, then posted the second-fastest time in the 
second run. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a tough course, which changed constantly throughout,''  
said the 21-year-old Miller, whose previous best results were 
eighth in the giant slaloms at Soelden and Adelboden. ``It suited 
me well, as most people make mistakes on a course like that. When I 
make mistakes, I recover well. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was just a matter of time for me,'' added Miller, who has  
raced three years on the national team. ``When I saw I was 13th and 
would ski the second run on a clean course, not all chopped up by 
countless skiers before me, I got fired up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In an effort to protect his lead in the overall World Cup  
standings, Maier ignored an ailing back to compete in the slalom, 
an event he usually skips. 
</P>
<P>
	While Maier did not get any points in the slalom, his time in  
the technical event added to his downhill Saturday, when he 
finished fourth, earned him 60 points in the combined event. 
</P>
<P>
	That gave him 1,021 points in the overall rankings, 169 ahead of  
Kjus.

<HEADLINE> Not All Online Shoppers Pleased </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Even with the huge boom in Internet sales this  
Christmas, not everyone is touting the joys of shopping online. 
</P>
<P>
	With the holidays now over, horror stories are emerging about  
packages failing to arrive on time, credit cards charged for items 
never purchased and inadequate customer service to handle such 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
	Some people are so frustrated they are even questioning whether  
they will shop again in cyberspace. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought shopping online was so easy, but it was a huge  
nightmare,'' said Stacie Baker, who struggled for nearly two months 
over an unfilled order with spree.com, a general merchandise store. 
``I'm not rushing to do it again soon.'' 
</P>
<P>
	E-commerce soared during Christmas time, as millions of new  
customers tried buying online for the first time. Internet research 
firm Jupiter Communications estimates holiday sales totaled $3.14 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall, customer satisfaction was quite high. Many people found  
what they wanted, easily bought it online and the item arrived on 
their doorstep in time for Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
	But there were glitches that disturbed many shoppers, and  
analysts warn that such problems could turn some shoppers away for 
good. 
</P>
<P>
	A survey of 2,300 online holiday shoppers to be released Monday  
by Jupiter found that a surprisingly small 37 percent said they 
would spend more next Christmas, while 58 percent said they would 
spend the same and 5 percent would spend less. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can't blow any part of your online game. You can't let  
your customers be disappointed,'' said Farhad Mohit, president and 
chief executive of Los Angeles-based Bizrate.com, an online market 
research firm. 
</P>
<P>
	``Up until now, online merchants worked to acquire customers,  
but now the key has to be making them repeat shoppers,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mike Fox was one of many Amazon.com customers who didn't get  
their purchases by Christmas. The Seattle-based company began 
e-mailing customers on Dec. 21 to warn them items would be 
delivered late due to inventory shortages. 
</P>
<P>
	Six of Fox's eight orders were delayed, and that forced him to  
call relatives and friends to tell them their gifts would not come 
by the holiday. Amazon.com did compensate Fox for the foulup by 
paying some of his shipping costs. 
</P>
<P>
	``This whole experience was frustrating and embarrassing,'' said  
Fox, a software engineer in North Carolina. ``Amazon was the name I 
trusted the most ... now I know I can't shop there if I need to 
count on something arriving by a certain time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	More than 270 shoppers filed complaints with the Better Business  
Bureau over Shopping.com, charging that the online store hasn't 
fulfilled orders or provided proper customer service. Of those 
complaints, 199 have been resolved, three are unresolved and 70 are 
pending. 
</P>
<P>
	Other sites, like barnesandnoble.com, the auction house eBay.com  
and toysrus.com, shut down or slowed to a crawl due to heavy 
demand. Some, including macys.com, kept taking orders for inventory 
that was already out of stock. 
</P>
<P>
	Research firm Bizrate.com, based on a survey of 67,000 shoppers  
in the fourth-quarter, found that 96 percent of those who got their 
merchandise on time said they will buy again online, but only 46 
percent of those who encountered delivery problems said they will 
consider making another purchase. 
</P>
<P>
	Realizing that any gaffes can deter shoppers, some merchants are  
already improving their online systems. 
</P>
<P>
	800.com, for instance, upgraded its network to handle more than  
double the traffic. The Portland, Ore.-based consumer electronics 
retailer faced a shutdown in early December when too many shoppers 
logged into its site to buy three movies or CDs for $1. 
</P>
<P>
	Many companies, including department store Azazz.com, let  
consumers get real-time answers to questions about products, 
availability, purchasing and shipping. Others are joining forces 
with shipping companies to allow consumers to track delivery of 
their purchases right from the Web site to their home.	   ``If I place an order, I want to know where it is and who is 
bringing it to my home,'' said Peter Nicholls, president of 
TanData, which is partnering with UPS on the tracking software. 
``There is no reason this isn't part of the online experience.'' 
</P>
<P>
	1-800-FLOWERS recently launched its ``Win Back'' program, where  
it calls shoppers who have complained about their online orders. On 
some occasions, the flower-delivery company will also send 
consumers $5 to $50 gift certificates to compensate for poor 
service. 
</P>
<P>
	But the changes still might not be enough to woo some shoppers  
back online. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not so much of a given anymore that a shopper who buys  
online once will buy again,'' said Nicole Vanderbilt, an Internet 
commerce analyst at Jupiter Communications. ``They are becoming 
less forgiving of all the glitches.''

<HEADLINE> Adler Wants More Books on Big Screen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Warren Adler has high hopes. His 17-year-old  
book, ``Random Hearts,'' is being made into a movie. Now he's 
hoping Hollywood will look at more than two dozen other novels he's 
written. 
</P>
<P>
	``I expect this to be a real resurrection for me,'' said Adler,  
a best-selling novelist and former reporter. 
</P>
<P>
	An earlier book, ``War of the Roses,'' became a film starring  
Michael Douglas, Danny DeVito and Kathleen Turner. 
</P>
<P>
	``What I did for hate in 'War of the Roses,' I did for love in  
'Random Hearts,''' Adler told The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	``Random Hearts'' is based on the 1982 crash of a plane into the  
14th Street Bridge in Washington. It's scheduled for release this 
summer and stars Harrison Ford and Kristin Scott Thomas.

<HEADLINE> One Octuplet Back on Ventilator </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- One of the seven surviving Houston octuplets was  
placed back on a ventilator Sunday while she fights an infection. 
</P>
<P>
	Gorom Louis, the last of the octuplets born last month to Nkem  
Chukwu and husband Iyke Louis, began antibiotic treatments Saturday 
after an infection surfaced, said Dr. Carol Lynn Berseth, the 
attending neonatologist. 
</P>
<P>
	Another of the octuplets, baby boy Ikem, remained on antibiotics  
Sunday after developing a blood infection Friday. Breast milk 
feedings were stopped for both children, who weighed almost 1 1/2 
pounds Friday, up about five ounces from their birth weights. 
</P>
<P>
	All seven of the babies -- two boys and five girls -- remain in  
critical but stable condition at Texas Children's Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Chukwu, a native of Nigeria, delivered her first baby,  
Ebuka, on Dec. 8. On Dec. 20, she delivered seven more children. 
Odera, a girl who weighed 10.3 ounces at birth, died a week after 
birth.

<HEADLINE> Activists Want IOC Trustees To Quit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Utah's governor and Olympic officials  
insist they will not yield to community activists who demand 
resignations of local committee members standing to make money from 
the 2002 Games. 
</P>
<P>
	Impact 2002 &AMP; Beyond, a coalition representing low-income,  
disabled and minority groups, wrote again to Gov. Mike Leavitt last 
week. The coalition wants Earl Holding and Alan Layton, trustees 
doing business with the Salt Lake Organizing Committee, to quit. 
</P>
<P>
	``It doesn't pass the smell test,'' said Glenn Bailey, a  
coalition leader. ``It's drilled into everyone in nonprofit 
management: You don't do anything that smacks of self-dealing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The International Olympic Committee is investigating reports of  
extravagant gifts and cash payments to some of its members in 
exchange for votes leading to the selection of Olympic cities. The 
U.S. Justice Department, U.S. Olympic Committee and a Salt Lake 
ethics panel are also investigating. 
</P>
<P>
	Holding owns Snowbasin Ski Area, which will get $13.8 million  
from SLOC as the downhill and super-G venue, and Little America 
Grand, a massive hotel being built downtown. It is expected to be 
the IOC's base during the games. 
</P>
<P>
	Layton' construction company last fall won a $29 million  
contract to enclose the Olympic speedskating oval. 
</P>
<P>
	Leavitt said Saturday he had not seen the letter, but he  
rejected the notion that SLOC trustees, appointed by him and the 
mayor, should resign. 
</P>
<P>
	``There will always be conflicts of interest,'' the governor  
said. ``There just needs to be a way to disclose them and handle 
them in the appropriate way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Layton said he will not resign.  
</P>
<P>
	``What we've done is scrupulously correct,'' he said, adding the  
activists are naive. ``Their whole contention that it's a gray area 
is offensive because it's not.'' 
</P>
<P>
	SLOC has an ethics code requiring trustees to disclose possible  
conflicts and not vote when their businesses are involved. Any 
deals between SLOC and its board members must be approved by the 
independent ethics panel that includes a former Utah Supreme Court 
justice and a former U.S. attorney. 
</P>
<P>
	SLOC also has a policy requiring contracts of any size be put  
out to bid. 
</P>
<P>
	Layton recused himself before the board in October approved  
Layton Construction Company's contract for the Oquirrh speedskating 
oval in Kearns. 
</P>
<P>
	``Things are very well advertised,'' Layton said. ``There's no  
inside information. My competitors are not missing out on any of 
this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Layton contends that managing an Olympics requires the ``best  
business minds in this community.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He adds that it would be extremely difficult to line up good  
leaders who have nothing to gain from the Olympics. For instance, 
two trustees are top executives at the state's largest electric and 
natural gas utilities. Another is the chief executive of the 
largest bank. 
</P>
<P>
	Holding will not comment about his role on the board while four  
investigations into accusations that Salt Lake's bid executives 
bribed IOC votes are under way, said Clint Ensign, a vice president 
at Holding's company, Sinclair Oil Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	``He did not seek to sit on the board. He was requested to serve  
and accepted that,'' Ensign said. 
</P>
<P>
	The ethics panel already has rejected a complaint by Impact 2002  
&AMP; Beyond. In a 1998 letter, the panel said Holding has complied 
with the ethics code because he disclosed his conflicts and 
disqualified himself from voting on the Snowbasin Ski Area 
contract. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Bailey says transactions achieved through disclosure  
and disqualification are not enough. 
</P>
<P>
	``It may be acceptable in the corporate world, but not in the  
nonprofit world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He says Olympic organizers want the advantages of a nonprofit  
organization, such as the ability to accept tax-free donations, 
while operating as a business. 
</P>
<P>
	``They are trading on the good name of the people of Utah,''  
Bailey said. ``They can't have it both ways.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Steven Ott, a University of Utah professor who teaches nonprofit  
management, notes there are no state laws barring trustees from 
doing business with the boards on which they serve. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can argue it's not immoral,'' he said. ``We do not have  
laws that make it illegal because it is kind of assumed nonprofits 
don't do that sort of stuff.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ott adds that the cultural tendency in Utah to trust those in  
authority combined with the closed traditions of the IOC may have 
allowed the scandal to mushroom. 
</P>
<P>
	``You put the two of them together and it's ripe for danger,''  
he said.

<HEADLINE> Brazil Crisis Renews Economy Threat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A two-month calm in world financial markets  
vanished suddenly as Brazil became last week the latest victim of a 
revived global economic crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	The fire wall that the Clinton administration and the  
International Monetary Fund had erected around Latin America's 
largest economy proved just as ineffectual as past efforts to 
contain the spreading contagion. 
</P>
<P>
	Brazil relinquished, at least for now, a defense of its  
currency, the real, and let it trade openly on foreign exchange 
markets. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision encouraged foreign investors, who saw it as a  
hopeful sign Brazilian authorities would not waste scarce reserves 
on a losing battle against currency speculators. 
</P>
<P>
	But even with Friday's 219-point rally, the Dow Jones industrial  
average dropped 303 points for the week. And the message from 
analysts to investors is: Brace for more bad weeks ahead. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Brazilian crisis is ongoing and open-ended,'' said Allen  
Sinai, chief global economist for Primark Decision Economics in New 
York. ``The aftershocks are likely to be substantial.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Economists worry that Brazil's economy will plunge even deeper  
into recession as the weaker currency sets off severe inflation. 
Trouble in Brazil, which accounts for half of Latin America's 
economic output, could quickly drag down its neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
	``Most of Latin America will now fall into recession, and there  
could be spillover effects in other emerging markets,'' said 
Merrill Lynch chief economist Bruce Steinberg. 
</P>
<P>
	Weakness in Latin America, which buys 20 percent of American  
exports, would mean more bad news for American manufacturers and 
farmers. Already they are suffering from a steep drop in exports to 
Asia, where the global financial crisis first struck in mid-1997. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to threatening to increase America's trade deficit,  
the troubles in Latin America pose a risk to hundreds of U.S. 
corporations with operations in the region. Overseas operations 
accounted for almost a third of U.S. corporations' earnings. 
</P>
<P>
	Economists also worry that growing economic ills in Latin  
America's developing nations will cause more instability in 
financial markets around the world. Such turbulence could jolt 
consumer confidence in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the rising trade deficit, the U.S. economy has fended  
off the global turmoil because U.S. consumers have continued to 
spend with abandon. 
</P>
<P>
	``Last year, the consumer came to the rescue, and all the sales  
American exporters lost in Asia were made up for with increased 
buying by American consumers. But if we get a market correction, 
then consumers could suddenly stop buying,'' said David Wyss, chief 
economist at Standard &AMP; Poor's DRI. 
</P>
<P>
	That was the fear among economists last August after the Asian  
crisis jumped to Russia. Moscow defaulted on billions of dollars in 
debt, shocking the U.S. and other global markets. 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Reserve moved quickly to ease the crisis. In  
September, the central bank made the first of three interest rate 
cuts that restored investor confidence and allowed markets to 
return to record territory by year's end. 
</P>
<P>
	Also helping to stabilize markets was a $41.5 billion package of  
financial support for Brazil that the Clinton administration 
convinced the IMF to assemble in November. The idea was to provide 
Brazil with a sizable line of reserves to ward off attacks from 
currency speculators. 
</P>
<P>
	The plan started to unravel when Brazilian President Fernando  
Henrique Cardoso could not make good on the government 
belt-tightening promises he made to justify the IMF support. 
</P>
<P>
	Brazilian financial authorities were in Washington this weekend  
to meet with IMF and U.S. Treasury officials in hopes of revamping 
Brazil's economic program to restore investor confidence. 
</P>
<P>
	Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin said Friday the key to resolving  
the crisis lies in Brazil's showing the resolve to honor its 
commitments. 
</P>
<P>
	``Whatever judgment one makes on exchange rate regimes and the  
rest, it always comes back to the same thing -- having sound 
policies at home,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration has much riding on its handling of  
the Brazilian crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, the administration used a strong lobbying campaign to  
overcome Republican objections in Congress to providing an 
additional $18 billion in U.S. support to the IMF. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration contended the money would help keep the Asian  
crisis from striking closer to home in Latin America. Brazil was 
seen as a crucial test for that strategy.

<HEADLINE> Parcells Plans To Stay Jets Coach </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- Bill Parcells has no plans to hop on the coaching  
carousel that has seen eight coaches fired or resign since the end 
of the regular season. 
</P>
<P>
	``Forget that,'' Parcells said when asked if he would step down  
after the New York Jets lost 23-10 to Denver in the AFC 
championship game Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	There had been speculation that Parcells might leave, especially  
if the Jets won the Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	Parcells cut short his postgame press conference, pleading  
exhaustion. 
</P>
<P>
	But he made it clear he was planning to return next season,  
saying the Jets need to ``start where we started last year, and not 
try to just pick up where we left off. We have to start over.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier in the week, reflecting on the heavy workload during the  
season, Parcells said, ``Success is never final. Never. There is 
always more to do. 
</P>
<P>
	``It can be arduous. It is hard work to get to where you are  
now. You've got to reteach your team every week, because it's a new 
environment every week.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jimmy Johnson nearly became the ninth coach to leave since the  
season ended. He made plans to resign last week, then decided to 
remain with the Miami Dolphins. 
</P>
<P>
	Five coaches were fired the day after the regular season ended --

<HEADLINE> Plan: Medicare To Pay for Insurance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Medicare would shift to helping elderly  
Americans buy health insurance instead of paying individual medical 
bills, as it does now, under a proposal a reform commission is 
considering. 
</P>
<P>
	The resulting competition among private health plans to attract  
elderly customers and their new Medicare subsidies could help the 
program save money and adapt to rapid technology changes, 
supporters say. 
</P>
<P>
	Both taxpayers and retirees, however, would have to pay more if  
health care prices continue to rise. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, lawmakers still would likely have to decide how to save  
more money when the number of people on Medicare almost doubles 
from today's 39 million as baby boomers begin retiring. 
</P>
<P>
	``Even if we're extraordinarily successful ... at keeping the  
per capita costs limited, there has to be some way to finance care 
for that many people,'' said John Rother, of the nation's largest 
organization of older adults, AARP. 
</P>
<P>
	Consensus is growing among members of the National Bipartisan  
Commission on the Future of Medicare to make the program work more 
like health benefits many companies and the federal government 
offer workers. 
</P>
<P>
	Under such a system, sometimes called ``premium support,'' a  
retiree could choose from a menu of government-approved health 
insurance plans and receive a Medicare subsidy to help cover the 
enrollment fee, or premium. 
</P>
<P>
	``It incorporates the changes ... in the needs and interests of  
the people much faster,'' said Rep. Bill Thomas, R-Calif., who 
co-chairs the commission and is among those working out details of 
such a proposal. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission must recommend by March 1 changes to the health  
care program for the elderly and disabled. Congress and the 
president would make final decisions. 
</P>
<P>
	Some commission members are skeptical that such a system could  
guarantee adequate protection to poor or sick Medicare 
beneficiaries. 
</P>
<P>
	``Premium support is nothing but a voucher system,'' said Rep.  
Jim McDermott, D-Wash. ``Unless there's a guarantee that every plan 
gives the same benefit package to anybody who buys it, and that you 
and I get it at the same price, this is going to be bad for the 
sick elderly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Currently, Medicare pays most people's medical bills directly,  
making cost control difficult. 
</P>
<P>
	Beneficiaries in many parts of the country can choose to enroll  
in a private managed-care health plan already. But with monthly 
payments based on the program's overall costs, some argue that 
money lost to inefficiency is compounded. 
</P>
<P>
	In contrast, if Medicare adopted premium support, insurance  
companies of all kinds -- not just managed care -- could compete for 
government contracts to provide a basic package of benefits. Those 
benefits likely would include at least what the program now covers. 
</P>
<P>
	Medicare would negotiate with the plans to get the best possible  
deals, then set an annual subsidy based on a percentage of the 
average bid. 
</P>
<P>
	For example, if Congress decided Medicare should pay 80 percent  
of people's insurance premiums and the plans' average bid was 
$5,000, the government subsidy would be $4,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
	Most retirees could end up paying significantly more or less  
than that $1,000, however. That's because different plans' total 
premium prices would vary. Plans offering extra perquisites might 
be more expensive, for example. 
</P>
<P>
	The familiar, government-run Medicare system also would remain  
available. But if it doesn't prove as efficient as the private 
plans, premiums would go up. 
</P>
<P>
	``Technically, a premium support is a form of a voucher, but it  
is a voucher that grows with the cost of the average health plan 
over time,'' said Stuart Altman, a Brandeis University professor on 
the Medicare commission. 
</P>
<P>
	In other words, if the price of insurance rises, taxpayers would  
directly share the burden. 
</P>
<P>
	The idea is likely to get support from Republicans in Congress,  
who have suggested vouchers as a solution to limit other government 
costs such as for education.	   Depending on the details, it also could appeal to Clinton 
administration officials who say they're open to options that would 
guarantee essential health benefits at a reasonable price. 
</P>
<P>
	Even if substantial consumer protections are built in, however,  
premium support would not be painless. 
</P>
<P>
	Currently, Medicare beneficiaries pay a standard monthly  
premium. At $45.50 this year, it covers about 10 percent of the 
program's costs and is scheduled to rise slowly over the next 
decade until it covers about 14 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The Medicare commission could recommend adjusting that ratio --  
having taxpayers cover a smaller percentage of each retiree's costs 
as the number of retirees grows, for example. 
</P>
<P>
	Or the panel could simply suggest the premium-support model --  
and let Congress decide how best to spread rising Medicare costs. 
Among the options: a sliding scale of subsidies so that wealthier 
retirees pay more.

<HEADLINE>  Brazil Holds Meeting With U.S., IMF </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Brazilian authorities met Sunday with U.S.  
officials and the International Monetary Fund, seeking ways to keep 
Latin America's largest economy from succumbing to an Asian-style 
currency crisis that could drag down other countries in the region. 
</P>
<P>
	Private economists warned that investor sentiment could sour  
quickly unless Brazil moves much more forcefully to address 
underlying problems, including the government's huge budget 
deficit. 
</P>
<P>
	Brazil was scheduled to provide details of its new currency  
regime early Monday before markets open. Brazilian Finance Minister 
Pedro Malan and central bank president Francisco Lopes held a 
series of meetings Saturday and Sunday with officials at the IMF 
and World Bank as well as the administration's point man for the 
global currency crisis, Deputy Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to Summers, the U.S. side was represented during  
several hours of afternoon talks by Timothy Geithner, the 
Treasury's top international official. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials described both the IMF and Treasury discussions as a  
wide-ranging review of steps Brazil already has taken and what 
further needs to be done to calm investor unease. 
</P>
<P>
	Malan told reporters that Brazil may ask for early release of  
the next installment of the $41.5 billion rescue package that the 
IMF put together for Brazil in November. Brazil has received $9 
billion already, and a similar amount was scheduled to be released 
next month. 
</P>
<P>
	A Brazilian newspaper reported that Brazil was considering  
allowing the nation's currency, the real, to float freely against 
the dollar on a long-term basis, following the market's positive 
reaction to Friday's announcement that the government was 
abandoning temporarily its defense of the real. 
</P>
<P>
	Financial markets around the world staged big gains on the news  
as investors demonstrated relief that the government of President 
Fernando Henrique Cardoso would no longer be wasting the country's 
dwindling foreign reserves to prop up the currency. 
</P>
<P>
	But analysts warned that during the 18 months of the current  
economic crisis, which began in Thailand on July 2, 1997, markets 
often have staged brief rallies on news that countries are giving 
up defense of their currencies only to plunge in later days as 
pessimism returns about a country's overall economic prospects. 
</P>
<P>
	``You won't have anything like the possibility of lasting  
stability until you see a lot more in terms of reforms on the part 
of Brazil,'' said C. Fred Bergsten, a Treasury official in the 
Carter administration and now head of the Institute of 
International Economics, a Washington think tank. 
</P>
<P>
	``If Brazil fails to do the things it needs to restore  
confidence, then you could have quite a bout of new contagion,'' 
Bergsten said. ``It could spill over into the rest of Latin 
America, most notably Argentina, and countries outside the region 
as well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bergsten said that Argentina, Hong Kong and China are most at  
risk from further market instability because they are all still 
trying to maintain fixed exchange rates with the dollar, rather 
than the more prevalent practice of allowing a nation's currency to 
be traded freely with the price set by what buyers are willing to 
pay. 
</P>
<P>
	Countries maintaining fixed exchange rates reap benefits in  
billions of dollars pouring in from foreign investors who have no 
fear that their holdings will be wiped out suddenly by a currency 
depreciation. But as experience has shown, such investment can flow 
out just as quickly when investor sentiment turns and worries 
intensify that countries will be forced to give up fixed-rate 
currency regimes. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration persuaded the IMF to put together a  
pre-emptive $41.5 billion credit line for Brazil, hoping that 
amount along with Brazil's own reserves would be enough to convince 
foreign investors that Brazil would not have to devalue. 
</P>
<P>
	Carodoso's government was unable to win approval in Brazil's  
Congress of budget cuts and tax increases needed to shrink the 
government deficit, however, which caused investors to grow nervous 
and begin another rush for the exits. 
</P>
<P>
	Those developments last week shattered what had been a two-month  
period of relative calm in global markets after the U.S. Federal 
Reserve rode to the rescue last fall with a series of three 
interest rate cuts to avert calamity. 
</P>
<P>
	``The only option Brazil had was to devalue and hope it goes in  
an orderly manner and doesn't spin out of control,'' said Sung Won 
Sohn, chief economist at Wells Fargo in Minneapolis. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the initial signs were encouraging, given that Brazil  
goes into the crisis with larger reserves than other nations that 
have gotten into trouble and a better track record under Cardoso of 
managing its economy.

<HEADLINE> Alaska Endures Hottest Year in '98 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) -- The nation's northernmost community  
endured its hottest year on record in 1998. Still, the typical day 
in Barrow was about as balmy as a typical day in your freezer. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year's ``heat wave'' drove up the average daily temperature  
in Barrow to 17 degrees -- remarkably mild for Alaska's arctic 
fringe, but nowhere near warm enough to melt, or even soften, a 
pint of Rocky Road ice cream. 
</P>
<P>
	What made the mildness remarkable was not that it surpassed a  
mark for annual warmth which had stood since 1940, but rather by 
how much -- the old record fell by 3 degrees, and the 30-year 
temperature average was shattered by 7 1/2 degrees. 
</P>
<P>
	``To break a yearly record by that amount is really  
phenomenal,'' Rick Thoman, a National Weather Service meteorologist 
in Fairbanks, said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Average temperature is calculated by averaging each day's high  
and low reading across the entire year. In Barrow that means 
balancing the few days of summer warmth -- in 1998 it got as high as 
67 degrees -- against the many subzero readings during the long 
winter -- three months of it spent in near-total darkness. 
</P>
<P>
	The weather in Barrow didn't set off a run on air conditioners  
or a cabana-building boom along the Arctic Ocean beachfront, but it 
was noticed by its 4,000 residents, most of them Inupiat Eskimos. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the summertime I usually shiver,'' said Maggie Ahmaogak,  
who's lived in Barrow for 48 years. ``Last summer I swear I didn't 
even shiver.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Not shivering has its upside, but Barrow residents also see  
downsides if 1998 is a sign of warmer times to come. 
</P>
<P>
	They're afraid a lack of a thick armor of ice along the shore  
may expose coastal dwellings to floods if a big storm rolls in. 
</P>
<P>
	They're afraid the bowhead whales that provide the core of their  
diet may swim further offshore, making them harder to kill. 
</P>
<P>
	And they're afraid the whale meat they store outdoors in holes  
may be ruined if their natural linings of ice and permafrost thaw 
out. Last summer some melting occurred and water seeped in, said 
Ahmaogak. 
</P>
<P>
	An obvious suspect in explaining the mercury's leap in Barrow  
might be human-induced global warming. Climatologists have long 
said such warming, instigated by burning fossil fuels, would be 
felt early in the Earth's polar regions. And Barrow has had several 
of its warmest years on record in the past decade. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of Alaska was slightly warmer than normal in 1998,  
according to the Alaska Climate Research Center in Fairbanks. But 
in Barrow, 11 of the year's 12 months exceeded the long-term 
average, measured from 1961 to 1990. 
</P>
<P>
	Weather scientists say they're still doing research, but from  
what they've learned so far, they think the answer is more 
complicated than global warming. 
</P>
<P>
	``Barrow was definitely one of those mysteries that cause people  
in science to get excited and start digging to find out why,'' said 
Gary Hufford, regional scientist for the National Weather Service 
in Anchorage. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year's temperature spike in Barrow also might be traced to  
warmer seas, but why were the seas warmer? Hufford thinks El Nino 
contributed, but he said there's also evidence suggesting Alaska as 
a whole goes through 20-year cycles of rising and falling 
temperatures. 
</P>
<P>
	``The climate at high latitudes is highly variable, but this is  
not proof humans are warming the climate,'' Thomas said. ``All we 
have is proof that Barrow has had some warm years lately.''

<HEADLINE> Lawmakers Turn Lobbyist in Congress </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Over the last four years, Gerald Solomon  
ranked among the most influential people on Capitol Hill, running 
the committee that decided which bills would reach the House floor. 
</P>
<P>
	Now retired, he'll continue to track legislation this year. And  
he'll still talk with friends, like new House Speaker Dennis 
Hastert, R-Ill. But now Solomon will be doing it as a lobbyist. 
</P>
<P>
	The New York Republican is one of a half dozen just-retired  
lawmakers moving right into the influence business as lobbyists or 
corporate advisers. Others include former Sens. Alfonse D'Amato and 
Dan Coats and former Reps. Vic Fazio, Scott Klug and Bill Paxon. 
</P>
<P>
	``The main selling point is over the years, you've developed  
very close relationships with members of Congress on both sides of 
the aisle,'' said Solomon, who spent two decades in Congress 
including the last four as House Rules Committee chairman. 
</P>
<P>
	These just-retired lawmakers are legally prohibited from  
formally lobbying Congress for a year, but their value to clients 
still is very high. They can lobby the White House and federal 
agencies immediately. They can walk onto the House floor or enter 
the cloakroom, off-limits to the public, to gather the latest 
intelligence for their clients. 
</P>
<P>
	And they can guide their clients through the congressional maze  
that all legislation must pass. They know whom to talk to and what 
information would be most effective in making the case. They can 
tell their clients what is going on in Congress, and about issues 
on the horizon they need to be concerned about. 
</P>
<P>
	``Strategic advice is what our clients are most interested in,''  
Paxon said. ``They want to look not only at this legislative 
session but down the road: What trends are developing; how they 
will play out. ... It's not simply knowing someone to insert a 
paragraph into the bill.'' 
</P>
<P>
	These lawmakers are following the well-worn path of predecessors  
who entered the lobbying business to trade on legislative contacts 
and knowledge of the government. 
</P>
<P>
	Nameplates on the doors of the Capitol's top firms are filled  
with ex-lawmakers. Former Senate Majority Leader Howard Baker heads 
a firm whose clients include American Airlines, Federal Express and 
Pillsbury. Two other former Senate majority leaders, Bob Dole and 
George Mitchell, joined Verner, Liipfert, Bernhard, McPherson and 
Hand, which represents General Motors, NBC, RJR Nabisco and others. 
Coats, an Indiana Republican, is joining that firm. 
</P>
<P>
	Former Reps. Thomas Downey of New York and Rod Chandler of  
Washington have built their own lobbying firm into a multimillion 
dollar business with clients like Boeing, DuPont and Time Warner. 
</P>
<P>
	And Solomon, who set up his own company, is sharing clients,  
employees and space with former Sen. Paul Laxalt, R-Nev., whose 
successful lobbying firm's clients include Lockheed Martin and the 
Nevada Resort Association. 
</P>
<P>
	``The members of Congress who move into these positions have  
dealt with individuals lobbying them who now potentially could 
become clients,'' said James Thurber, director of American 
University's Center for Congressional and Presidential Studies. 
``They're rainmakers. Having distinguished members of the House or 
Senate in your firm certainly gives you leverage when you're 
competing with other firms to get clients.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Several Clinton administration officials also have passed  
through the revolving door in recent years, including former White 
House counsel Jack Quinn; Linda Hall Daschle, former Federal 
Aviation Administration Deputy Administrator and wife of Senate 
Democratic leader Tom Daschle; and former Treasury Secretary Lloyd 
Bentsen. 
</P>
<P>
	Paxon has joined the powerhouse law firm of Akin, Gump, Strauss,  
Hauer &AMP; Feld, which represents such blue-chip clients as Johnson &AMP; 
Johnson, the National Basketball Association and Philip Morris. He 
was recruited by Robert Strauss, an elder statesman of the 
Democratic Party. 
</P>
<P>
	Fazio joined Clark &AMP; Weinstock to become one of two partners  
running the Washington office. The other is ex-Rep. Vin Weber of 
Minnesota, who began the Washington operation after he retired in 
1994. Their clients include AT&AMP;T, MetLife and Microsoft. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a continuation of what I've been doing to a large  
degree,'' Fazio said. ``Instead of doing it for constituents, I'm 
now doing it for people who want to retain my services.''

<HEADLINE> Kan. Farmers Plant White Wheat Crop / Farm Scene  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WICHITA, Kan. (AP) -- By the year 2000, Kansas farmers expect to  
bring to market their first bushels of hard white winter wheat, 
which they hope will help maintain the state's reputation as the 
world's breadbasket well into the next century. 
</P>
<P>
	For now, just 1,000 acres of the new crop -- in two varieties and  
all destined for use as certified seed -- have been planted in eight 
locations around Kansas. About half of that acreage is irrigated, 
according to the Kansas Association of Wheat Growers. 
</P>
<P>
	By comparison, Kansas farmers have planted 10 million acres of  
hard red winter wheat, the crop that won Kansas its top ranking as 
a wheat state. 
</P>
<P>
	Kansas has been preparing for years to make the shift to hard  
white wheat -- which is increasingly preferred in the global 
marketplace, particularly in Asia. 
</P>
<P>
	``White wheat will become the majority wheat in Kansas between  
five and 10 years,'' said Ron Madl, director of the Wheat Research 
Center at Kansas State University. 
</P>
<P>
	This coming harvest is critical because it marks the first time  
the two white varieties, dubbed Betty and Heyne, left the research 
fields after their public release last fall. Farmers will be 
watching carefully how well the foundation seed does under real 
field conditions, and how well grain elevators are able to keep the 
white separate from the red wheat. 
</P>
<P>
	Madl said the state hopes to harvest between 50,000 and 70,000  
bushels of registered seed come spring. That seed would be planted 
next fall, producing enough crops for both certified seed as well 
as for market consumption. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are talking year 2000 harvest for when we will have initial  
market introduction,'' Madl said. ``The 2001 harvest will be the 
first harvest in which a significant portion of Kansas wheat could 
be white wheat.'' 
</P>
<P>
	By 2001, between 10 percent and 20 percent of Kansas's wheat  
crop will be white wheat, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Kansas State University's new varieties reportedly can survive  
better in the Plains states because of their winter hardiness, 
drought and heat tolerance and resistance to disease and insects.

<P>
	A smaller quantity of the foundation seed was made available to  
Kansas farmers because of storm damage to some of the growing 
fields in the spring of 1998, the growers association said. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the white wheat this year was planted by seed growers in  
western Kansas, west of Great Bend, although at least one planting 
was put in near Wellington in central Kansas, said Brett Myers, the 
association's executive vice president. That is because the new 
varieties seem especially well-suited for growing conditions in 
western Kansas. 
</P>
<P>
	Industry leaders have been holding informational meetings  
statewide on white wheat, attended so far by more than 800 
producers. 
</P>
<P>
	Of prime concern at the gatherings has been how to keep red and  
white wheats separate when farmers start taking their crops to the 
grain elevator. The best way to do that, Madl said, would be to 
designate certain elevators or silos for this harvest for white 
wheat only. 
</P>
<P>
	``White wheat is critical to Kansas maintaining its position as  
a wheat state because red wheat simply will continue to find less 
and less market in the world,'' Madl said. ``That has been clearly 
demonstrated by the export markets over the past 20 years.''

<HEADLINE> Van Gogh Fans at L.A. Exhibit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Vincent van Gogh looked a little surprised  
from behind his gilded frame. 
</P>
<P>
	The painter stared out with a bemused expression from his  
``Self-Portrait as an Artist'' while nearly 4,000 starry-eyed 
admirers clutched $24 tickets for the opening of ``Van Gogh's Van 
Goghs'' at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Though the troubled, lonely artist sold few paintings during his  
life, this exhibit has brought him rock star-like status despite 
the absence of popular works such as ``The Starry Night'' and van 
Gogh's famous still-life flowers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wanted to see those famous ones, but this show is  
beautiful,'' said Mary Ann Downs, 40, of Thousand Oaks. ``My 
daughter asked, 'Why are you crying, Mom?''' 
</P>
<P>
	Museum officials expect nearly 900,000 people to attend the show  
during its four-month stint in Los Angeles. An estimated 450,000 
attended the display in Washington, D.C., this fall. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is once in a lifetime, never again will so many works be  
traveling abroad,'' said Willem van Gogh, chairman of the Vincent 
van Gogh Foundation. He is the great-grandson of the painter's late 
brother, Theo van Gogh. 
</P>
<P>
	The paintings left for the United States only after workers  
began renovations on the artist's museum in Amsterdam, Willem van 
Gogh said. This is the second and last American stop before the 
paintings return to Amsterdam on May 16. 
</P>
<P>
	Opening-day visitors joked and jostled each other like fans at a  
football game while waiting in hour-long lines to see 70 of the 
Dutch impressionist's masterpieces. 
</P>
<P>
	``Go van Gogh!'' Denise Willson, 40, cheered as she waited in  
line with her husband and two friends. ``If you have an ear for 
art, go van Gogh!'' 
</P>
<P>
	Eager shoppers at the museum gift-store snatched up cards,  
posters and everything from van Gogh pop-up books to refrigerator 
magnets. 
</P>
<P>
	``How cool is it to be a kid and have a van Gogh lunch box?''  
said Chicago tourist Laura Grisolano, 34, while hoisting an armload 
of three lunch boxes, two T-shirts, a pencil case and a framed 
print for her husband, who could not get a ticket. 
</P>
<P>
	John Rowe shelled out $110 for a framed print of ``Wheatfield  
with Crows.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I think this one is even larger than the real one,'' he said,  
leaning against the frame. ``The other paintings at my house will 
get a lot more cramped on the wall.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The mood was far more somber inside the five-room exhibit, where  
the first section featured many of van Gogh's earlier, darker works 
such as ``Skull of a Skeleton with Burning Cigarette'' and ``The 
Potato Eaters,'' a depiction of five gaunt peasants dining under a 
dim oil lamp. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm scared,'' one young girl said to her mother after leaving  
the room. 
</P>
<P>
	Many clustered around well-known works such as ``The Bedroom,''  
a wide-angled perspective of van Gogh's brightly colored bed and 
nightstand. 
</P>
<P>
	``His brush strokes were so thick,'' said Oskar Ulloa, 25.  
``Seeing it in person... it's almost like looking at a sculpture.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Also attracting large groups was ``Wheatfield with a Reaper,'' a  
death metaphor in which van Gogh had explained was a ``vague figure 
fighting like the devil in the midst of the heat to get to the end 
of his task.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Carolyn Willis Vena, 60, a Los Angeles artist, said she enjoyed  
the paintings from van Gogh's years in Paris, where he adopted the 
bright colors and brisk strokes of the impressionist movement. 
</P>
<P>
	``He had a way of looking at a field of wheat and seeing so much  
more than other people. That translates in his art,'' she said. ``I 
think he was sort of crazy, and he was alone and saw things 
differently, while most of us would just see what the rest of 
society saw.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton Rehearses Annual Address </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton rehearsed his State of the  
Union speech Sunday in an effort to strike a tone pleasing both to 
members of Congress who hold the fate of his career and policies in 
their hands -- as well as to average citizens who still give him 
high marks for job performance. 
</P>
<P>
	After church and a few hours of relaxing, the president walked  
to the White House theater for a second day of rehearsals in front 
of roughly 20 people. He practiced in his sport jacket and tie, 
standing at a podium with his teleprompters in place. Nearby stood 
two computer terminals for making changes. 
</P>
<P>
	Much of the work was focused on trimming a draft that aides  
admitted is way too long. ``Everything is there, but it's got to be 
tightened,'' said a senior official, speaking Sunday on condition 
of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're beyond drafts now,'' said White House spokesman Joe  
Lockhart. ``There were three of four real drafts, and there were 
considerable changes from draft to draft. They're in the stage now 
that they're just throwing out pages and writing in the margins.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, administration officials let it be known late Sunday  
that one thing Clinton will propose in his speech is a child-care 
tax credit for stay-at-home moms similar to a program pushed in 
Congress last year by Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the latest in a long list of White House initiatives  
publicized in recent weeks as the administration budget proposals 
evolved. 
</P>
<P>
	On the Sunday talk shows, some lawmakers renewed a plea for  
Clinton to skip the speech, noting they won't find it easy to segue 
from trying the president's impeachment case a few hours earlier. 
Still, they said they planned to be on hand to hear it. 
</P>
<P>
	``Quite frankly, I'd rather go to the dentist. But I intend to  
go,'' Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, said on ABC's ``This Week.'' ``I'm 
going to applaud. I'm going to be respectful. Despite all the 
political rhetoric, I don't hate Bill Clinton.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The president rehearsed Saturday for about four hours and was  
spending at least that long Sunday, Lockhart said. The aides with 
him listened carefully to his delivery, noting how he handles 
themes that are likely to resonate with lawmakers -- and beyond 
that, the 70 million to 80 million Americans expected to watch at 
home Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously, this is the last State of the Union before the  
millennium, and he will recognize that,'' Lockhart said. He 
declined to offer specifics. 
</P>
<P>
	Plenty of policy items in Clinton's speech already have been  
revealed, such as plans to reduce violence against children, 
improve military readiness and food safety, and to meet Americans' 
long-term health care needs. But little has been said about how 
Clinton plans to ensure that Social Security will remain solvent as 
the oversized baby boom generation retires. 
</P>
<P>
	In a letter dated Sunday, Republican leaders told Clinton that  
they will be listening closely to what he says about tax cuts, 
defense spending, expanding local control over education dollars 
and overhauling Social Security ``without tax increases or benefit 
cuts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., and House Speaker  
Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., invited Clinton to submit a Social Security 
proposal before March 1, the date they said they have scheduled a 
joint House-Senate committee meeting to receive it. 
</P>
<P>
	``Although your presentation of the traditional State of the  
Union address will occur this year under extraordinary 
circumstances, we should not permit those circumstances to distract 
us from the nation's legislative agenda,'' Lott and Hastert wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	In his television appearance, Gramm suggested that in light of  
the impeachment trial Clinton should submit his speech in writing 
as presidents did until early this century. Otherwise, he said, 
``It's like adjourning a trial to have the accused give a pep rally 
before the grand jury.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans appearing on the same ABC program said boos -- like  
those Clinton got in his 1995 speech -- or other displays of 
disrespect are unlikely Tuesday night, regardless of where 
lawmakers stand on impeachment. 
</P>
<P>
	``I intend to applaud respectfully out of respect to the office,  
not out of respect to the individual,'' said Rep. James 
Sensenbrenner, R-Wis.

<HEADLINE> Tokyo Stock Prices Finish Higher / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Tokyo stock prices finished higher Monday as  
investors showed some relief concerning the Brazilian financial 
crisis following Friday's rally on Wall Street. The dollar edged 
higher against the yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose 66.20 points,  
or 0.48 percent, closing at 13,805.06. On Thursday, the average 
gained 335.26 points, or 2.50 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 113.94 yen in mid-afternoon trading, up 0.48  
yen from late in Tokyo on Thursday but lower than its late level 
Friday in New York of 114.13 yen. 
</P>
<P>
	Japanese financial markets were closed Friday for a national  
holiday. 
</P>
<P>
	Tokyo stocks advanced moderately as investors were heartened by  
a recovery in U.S. and other world stock exchanges Friday following 
moves by the Brazilian government to stabilize its economy, Latin 
America's largest. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Tokyo market welcomed a temporary relief from worries over  
the Brazilian economy,'' said Masatoshi Sato, manager of the 
investor information group at Kankaku Securities. 
</P>
<P>
	Brazil caused a panic in world financial markets Wednesday when  
it devalued its currency, the real, by 8 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	But the country's decision Friday to stop spending heavily to  
support the real generated confidence that the government was 
taking appropriate measures to nurse the economy back to health. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, the Dow Jones industrial average rose 219.62 points  
to 9,340.55, making up a large portion of the 522 points it lost 
earlier in the week. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section was up 5.85 points, or 0.55 percent, to 1,075.79. The 
TOPIX closed up 12.86 points, or 1.22 percent, Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency dealings, the dollar moved as high as 114.55 yen at  
one point earlier in the session following Friday's gains in New 
York stock prices, but the trend soon reversed course, as Japanese 
exporters and overseas hedge funds took profits by selling dollars 
for yen. 
</P>
<P>
	Japanese exporters and overseas investors sold dollars amid  
wariness about the effects of the Brazilian crisis on the U.S. 
economy, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Brazilian situation is still very murky and no one can  
predict its effects on the U.S. economy,'' said Takayuki Togawa, 
manager of the foreign exchange division at Tokai Bank. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the euro was quoted at 132.06 yen, down from 132.30  
yen late Thursday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the benchmark No. 182 10-year Japanese government  
bond rose to 1.725 percent from Thursday's finish of 1.665 percent, 
driving its price down to 100.60 yen from 101.09 yen.

<HEADLINE> Folk Paintings Sets Auction Record </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Two paintings by American folk artist Edward  
Hicks fetched a total of more than $6.1 million at Christie's 
auction house, a record for American folk art. 
</P>
<P>
	The paintings, titled ``The Residence of David Twining'' and  
``Peaceable Kingdom,'' sold Friday for $1,432,500, and $4,732,500, 
respectively. 
</P>
<P>
	The first painting set a record sale at the auction house for  
works by the artist and for American folk art, only to have the 
record broken by sale of the second. 
</P>
<P>
	The works were believed to have been painted in 1837.  
</P>
<P>
	The buyers, whose names were not released, were described as  
private American collectors. 
</P>
<P>
	Hicks, a 19th century Quaker leader who supported himself with  
his art, painted more than 60 ``Peaceable Kingdoms'' illustrating 
the vision of the biblical prophet Isaiah.

<HEADLINE> Brazil To Unveil Policy on Currency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRASILIA, Brazil (AP) -- Brazil's decision last week to stop  
propping up its overvalued currency was a step toward overcoming a 
financial crisis that has overpowered the economy since August. 
</P>
<P>
	The next step comes today, when the Brazilian government is  
expected to say whether it will continue to allow its currency -- 
the real -- to trade openly on foreign exchange markets. 
</P>
<P>
	The Folha de Sao Paulo newspaper reported that the government  
will allow the real to float in relation to the dollar on a 
long-term basis, following the market's positive reaction to 
Friday's announcement that the government was abandoning 
temporarily its defense of the real. 
</P>
<P>
	The report could not be confirmed.  
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, Brazil announced it would not dip into its cash  
reserves to prop up its beleaguered currency. The real plunged as 
low as 1.60 to the dollar before strengthening slightly to 1.43 at 
the close of trading. That was down from 1.32 at the close of 
trading Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The move came just two days after the Central Bank tried a  
smaller devaluation of 8 percent by extending the band in which the 
currency could trade to between 1.20 reals and 1.32 reals to the 
dollar. 
</P>
<P>
	In all, the currency has fallen more than 15 percent since  
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Finance Minister Pedro Malan and new Central Bank chief  
Francisco Lopes met in Washington on Sunday with U.S. officials and 
the International Monetary Fund, which in November put together a 
$41.5 billion aid package for Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
	The global financial crisis hit Brazil full force in August,  
when investors pulled money out, fearing the government couldn't 
cover a $65 billion budget deficit and might default on loans. 
</P>
<P>
	Since then, more than $40 billion has left the country, dropping  
reserves to around $35 billion.

<HEADLINE> Oddsmakers Like Broncs by 7 in Bowl </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- Finally, the AFC has a champion favored to win  
the Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	Denver's comeback win Sunday over the New York Jets impressed  
Las Vegas oddsmakers enough to open the Broncos as an 8 1/2-point 
favorite to win their second straight Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	Bettors weren't quite as impressed, though, quickly betting the  
number down to seven points with some wagers on the Atlanta Falcons 
even as the final seconds were ticking off of the AFC championship 
game. 
</P>
<P>
	``As soon as we hung it out there we had a $20,000 bet on both  
sides,'' said Joe Lupo, sports book manager at the Stardust 
hotel-casino. ``We respected the view of one of the individuals a 
little more and lowered the number to seven.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was the first time since the Buffalo Bills were a touchdown  
favorite over the New York Giants in 1991 that an AFC team has been 
favored to win the Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	Of course, the Falcons weren't even supposed to be in the Super  
Bowl to begin with. When the season opened, bettors could get 60-1 
odds on Atlanta winning the Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's a pretty fair number,'' said Las Vegas Sports  
Consultant's Joel Brewster, who sets the odds for most major Las 
Vegas casinos. ``The Broncos are certainly a better team than 
Atlanta, although the Falcons showed today that they can win a big 
game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brewster put out the initial 8 1/2-point line to sports books with  
about five minutes still remaining on the game clock in the 
Denver-New York game. Some put it up immediately, while others 
waited to see where the number would settle before posting it. 
</P>
<P>
	A quick flurry of betting dropped the Broncos to a 7-point  
favorite, and most book operators said they thought the line would 
settle in at that point. 
</P>
<P>
	``Seven is a pretty solid number,'' Lupo said. ``From what I can  
see, it's a solid seven around town.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Denver, which was an 11 1/2-point underdog last year to Green Bay,  
would have been an underdog again this year had the Minnesota 
Vikings beaten the Falcons for the NFC title. Brewster said he 
would have probably made the Vikings a 3-point pick over the 
Broncos. 
</P>
<P>
	At the MGM Grand hotel-casino, book director Will Hall waited to  
see where the point spread would settle before he put up a number. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was thinking Denver would be a 9-point favorite, but I  
wanted to wait to see what other people put up,'' Hall said. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, bettors wagered a record $77.2 million in Nevada's  
legal sports book on the game, with untold millions bet elsewhere 
illegally. 
</P>
<P>
	Betting traditionally falls off to almost nothing the day after  
the championship games and the line remains the same until bettors 
began putting their money up in the days just before the Super 
Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	Hall said betting on this year's Super Bowl should be good  
because of a point spread just around a touchdown and the fact that 
fans see Atlanta as a team of destiny. Had the Vikings won, though, 
he said betting would have been bigger. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought it had the potential to be the first pick 'em Super  
Bowl,'' Hall said. ``That would have really been something.''

<HEADLINE> Blood Trials Done Without Consent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- A company conducted an ill-fated blood substitute  
trial without the informed consent of patients in the study -- some 
of whom died, federal officials say. 
</P>
<P>
	Baxter International Inc. was able to test the substitute known  
as HemAssist without consent because of a 1996 change in federal 
Food and Drug Administration regulations. 
</P>
<P>
	The changes broke a 50-year standard to get consent for nearly  
all experiments on humans. They were designed to help research in 
emergency medicine that could not happen if doctors took the time 
to get consent. 
</P>
<P>
	But the problems with the HemAssist trial are prompting some  
medical ethicists to question the rule change. 
</P>
<P>
	``People get involved in something to their detriment without  
any knowledge of it,'' George Annas, a professor of health law at 
the Boston University School of Public Health, told the Chicago 
Tribune. ``We use people. What's the justification for that?'' 
</P>
<P>
	No other company has conducted a no-consent experiment under the  
rule, FDA officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Baxter officials halted their clinical trial of HemAssist last  
spring after reviewing data on the first 100 trauma patients 
enrolled in the nationwide study. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the 52 critically ill patients given the substitute, 24 died,  
representing a 46.2 percent mortality rate. The Deerfield, 
Ill.-based company had projected 42.6 percent mortality for 
critically ill patients seeking emergency treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	There has been an intense push to find a blood substitute  
because artificial blood could ease the effects of whole-blood 
shortages. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers say it lasts longer than conventional blood,  
eliminates the time-consuming need to match blood types and wipes 
out the risk of contamination with such viruses as HIV and 
hepatitis. 
</P>
<P>
	The principle of informed consent was first articulated  
following the revelation that Nazi doctors performed hideous 
experiments during World War II. It became even more important 
because of U.S. -backed syphilis experiments on blacks in the South 
that went on for decades after a cure for the disease were 
revealed. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1996 regulations require a level of community notification  
that is not used in most scientific studies, including community 
meetings, news releases and post-study follow-up. 
</P>
<P>
	Some say such notification cannot replace direct consent from  
patients or their relatives. 
</P>
<P>
	``Public notification means nothing,'' said Dr. Arthur Caplan,  
director of the Center for Bioethics at the University of 
Pennsylvania. ``I know people are enamored of it, but it means 
nothing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	No lawsuits have arisen from the blood substitute trial, Baxter  
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The regulations worked in this instance,'' company spokeswoman  
Mary Thomas said Sunday. ``We voluntarily stopped the trial early 
on at the first sign of unexpected results to insure patient 
safety.''

<HEADLINE> Nagano Spent $22,000 on IOC Members </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- The committee that successfully bid for the 1998  
Nagano Winter Olympics spent nearly $22,000 on each of 62 visiting 
IOC members. 
</P>
<P>
	The report by the nationwide Mainichi newspaper is the first  
that begins to detail long-rumored payments by Japanese officials 
to land the games. 
</P>
<P>
	It comes in the wake of admissions last week by a senior  
official of the Nagano bid committee that accounting records had 
been destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
	The newspaper reported the Nagano bid committee spent an  
estimated average of $21,905 per visiting IOC member as part of its 
``negotiation fees,'' citing committee documents and unnamed former 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
	Eight officials suspected of involvement with the Salt Lake City  
bribery scandal were among the dozens of IOC members treated to 
such freebies as first-class airfare to Japan, all expense paid 
stays at hot spring resorts and helicopter tours, the paper said 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	But Sumikazu Yamaguchi, vice secretary general of the Nagano bid  
committee, denied the reported level of spending on IOC 
delegations. 
</P>
<P>
	No more than $4,381 was spent on each IOC member -- not including  
international airfares -- as part of a total bid promotion budget of 
$9.6 million, he said late Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	In another development, the Swiss newspaper Le Matin reported  
that one-third of the $70 million cost of Lausanne's Olympic museum 
was picked up by Japanese donors. 
</P>
<P>
	The paper, citing figures provided by the museum's management,  
said Japanese contributors including Toyota, Hitachi and Japan 
Airlines contributed $23 million to the cost. Spanish and American 
contributors each added $6 million and South Korea $4.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Nagano was awarded the games in 1991 when construction of the  
museum was under way. Spain held the 1992 Summer Olympics in 
Barcelona and the United State was awarded the 1996 Summer Games in 
Atlanta and the 2002 Winter Games in Salt Lake City. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not a case of corruption in this business. Just big  
money. Very big money,'' the newspaper said. 
</P>
<P>
	The paper also noted Norway and Australia -- who have won recent  
Olympic bids -- had not donated to the museum costs. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, IOC executive Marc Hodler set off a bribery scandal  
with accusations of vote-buying by Salt Lake bidders for the 2002 
Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch said last week that nine  
IOC members have been accused of ``serious'' offenses in connection 
with the Salt Lake City bid and could be expelled. Four others are 
being cited for minor violations. 
</P>
<P>
	In Japan, lavish gifts and expensive wining and dining have long  
been an established way of doing business. Accusations of bribery 
during Nagano's 1989-1991 bidding effort are nothing new. 
</P>
<P>
	None of the speculation has been proved, however. And it may  
prove impossible to document. 
</P>
<P>
	The Asahi, another major Japanese newspaper, reported Friday  
that Yamaguchi ordered the 90-volume accounting books be burned in 
1992. He confirmed on Friday the records were destroyed shortly 
after the bidding. 
</P>
<P>
	When a group of Nagano residents filed a lawsuit that year  
demanding to know how their taxes were spent in winning the games, 
Nagano bidders had said the records could not be found. 
</P>
<P>
	The question of who lost or destroyed the records was never  
answered.

<HEADLINE> Self-Portraits Painter Gets NY Show </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Dutch artist Philip Akkerman likes to paint  
his own picture -- he has done it 1,262 times in the last 17 years 
and says he will never do anything else. He is 41. 
</P>
<P>
	The Smithsonian Institution's Hirshhorn Museum has bought three  
of his works and considers them a good buy. 
</P>
<P>
	``Akkerman is a contemporary everyman, reminding us that the  
human condition, perhaps now more than ever, is worth taking time 
to reflect about,'' said Neal Benezra, the museum's assistant 
director for public programs. 
</P>
<P>
	Akkerman's paintings have been in one-man shows in Washington  
and European cities. About 60 of them, all staring straight at the 
viewer, will get their first New York show in March. 
</P>
<P>
	``My ego is not any bigger or smaller than that of any other  
person,'' he wrote in a fax from his studio in The Hague. ``I am 
painting nothing but self-portraits, that is a fact, but I am not 
painting myself. 
</P>
<P>
	``What I am painting is the mystery of existence.''  
</P>
<P>
	He explained that he had not always been so single-minded.  
</P>
<P>
	``Before concentrating on self-portraits I changed styles and  
technique every two or three months,'' he said. ``I did abstract 
paintings, photography, performance (art), sculpture. You name it 
and I did it. I was young and followed my heart.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So far as numbers of self-portraits go, Rembrandt -- about 50 --  
and van Gogh -- 44 -- are not in the running. They had Akkerman's 
Dutch tenacity and industry, too, but different forms of 
single-mindedness. 
</P>
<P>
	The big van Gogh show that previously was in Washington and  
opens in Los Angeles on Sunday has a roomful of self-portraits, 
done partly because the artist was too poor to hire a model. 
</P>
<P>
	Money is not Akkerman's problem. Manfred Baumgartner, who shows  
Akkerman's work in his Washington gallery, asks $3,500 for a 
painting only 17 inches by 19 inches. That is as big as Akkerman 
makes them. 
</P>
<P>
	Baumgartner said he has been thinking of raising the price when  
he moves his gallery to New York's trendy Chelsea art district. He 
added in an interview that he was moving in part to help Akkerman, 
whose work he collects himself. 
</P>
<P>
	The artist will arrive well-supplied.  
</P>
<P>
	``When I come to New York in March, I hope to have added 20  
paintings and 20 drawings, more or less,'' he wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	So far he numbers his drawings, also exclusively self-portraits,  
at 1,732.

<HEADLINE> Two Die in Ohio Train Collision </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRYAN, Ohio (AP) -- Three freight trains crashed into each other  
early Sunday, killing two crew members and derailing cars over a 
quarter-mile of tracks. 
</P>
<P>
	One engine burned for hours and the wreckage blocked a main  
railroad route between the East and Chicago. A handful of homes in 
Bryan, about 50 miles west of Toledo, were evacuated for several 
hours. 
</P>
<P>
	Coroner John Moats said the victims were from Angola, Ind., and  
Oregon, Ohio. Their names were not released. Both were thrown from 
the engine and died of head injuries, Moats said. 
</P>
<P>
	The cause remained under investigation. It was not clear whether  
fog in the area contributed to the 2 a.m. accident. 
</P>
<P>
	A train taking mail from Morrisville, Pa., to Chicago hit  
another westbound train carrying trailers and containers from 
Boston to Chicago, said Bim McGeehan, a spokesman for 
Philadelphia-based Contrail. The victims were on the mail train. 
</P>
<P>
	A third train, with 50 empty cars, hit debris from the crash.  
The train was traveling east from Portage, Ind., to River Rouge, 
Mich., near Detroit, McGeehan said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sixteen cars from the three trains derailed in the accident.  
</P>
<P>
	McGeehan said track, computer and electronic signals are  
supposed to keep trains from getting too close to each other. He 
said he did not know how fast the trains were going when they hit 
each other. 
</P>
<P>
	Train traffic was being rerouted through a line in Michigan  
until debris can be cleared and the track repaired, McGeehan said.

	BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) -- NATO ordered its two top generals to  
Belgrade to impress upon Yugoslav authorities the gravity of the 
situation after a massacre of ethnic Albanians in Kosovo. In a 
statement, NATO condemned the killing of 45 people reported 
yesterday and called it a ``flagrant violation of international 
humanitarian law.'' The threat of NATO airstrikes, hanging over the 
heads of Serb authorities since October, remained an option today 
as Serb forces launched a new attack on the ethnic Albanian village 
of Racak, where the massacre took place.

including Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr and informant Linda 
Tripp, if the Republicans press forward with their plan to summon 
witnesses. Clinton will deliver his State of the Union speech

<HEADLINE> Clinton, Gores Share Spotlight </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- In this budget season, preceding the 2000  
campaign season, President Clinton is sharing the political wealth 
not only with Vice President Al Gore, but with Tipper too. 
</P>
<P>
	Both of the Gores, who hope to win the White House in 2000, are  
being given their own slices of the spotlight this year as the 
Clinton administration unveiled its spending plans for the coming 
budget cycle. 
</P>
<P>
	And both of the Gores will be at Clinton's side when he and  
first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton stage high-profile pep rallies in 
Buffalo, N.Y., and suburban Philadelphia the morning after the 
State of the Union address. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Gore traveled last week to New Hampshire, that  
all-important political bellwether, to unveil the president's 
budget plans -- a proposed $358 million, or 24 percent spending hike 
-- for state grants on mental health, her signature issue. Clinton 
would seek another $13 million to start a national pilot project 
giving free school breakfasts to low-income students, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Gore also announced $869,000 in federal weatherization  
assistance for low-income families, giving local leaders the good 
news that 640 New Hampshire families would get help making their 
homes energy efficient. 
</P>
<P>
	The privilege of unveiling a proposed $700 million in tax  
credits to finance suburban parks and green areas went to the vice 
president last week. 
</P>
<P>
	Such announcements, whether or not Congress ever follows up with  
the funds, are used to cement ties with friendly interest groups 
who might someday return the favor with campaign donations. 
</P>
<P>
	But White House press secretary Joe Lockhart insisted the Gores  
are pitching in only to ease the president's load when there are so 
many budget items to highlight. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have a lot of things going in and only so many days the  
president can do events,'' Lockhart said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton himself is more explicit about the strategy to anoint  
Gore. 
</P>
<P>
	At a Democratic party dinner Friday, Clinton called his  
handpicked successor ``far and away, not even close, the most 
influential person ..., achieving more for the American people than 
anyone who has ever held his position in the entire history of the 
republic.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Such superlatives will be trumpeted ``increasingly in the months  
ahead,'' Clinton promised. After all, 2000 is just 11 months away. 
</P>
<P>
	By the way, Clinton added, don't hold any of that campaign  
finance or Monica Lewinsky stuff against Gore. ``Any mistakes we 
made,'' he told his partisans, ``were my fault.''

<HEADLINE> Blood Trials Done Without Consent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Twenty-four critically ill patients died after  
being given a blood substitute without their informed consent, 
according to federal officials. 
</P>
<P>
	Baxter International Inc. was able to test the substitute known  
as HemAssist without consent because of a 1996 change in U.S. Food 
and Drug Administration regulations. 
</P>
<P>
	The change, which broke with a 50-year standard that required  
informed consent for nearly all experiments on humans, was designed 
to facilitate research in emergency medicine that could not happen 
if doctors were forced to take the time to get patient consent. 
</P>
<P>
	Baxter officials halted their clinical trial of HemAssist last  
spring after reviewing data on the first 100 trauma patients 
enrolled in the nationwide study. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the 52 critically ill patients given the substitute, 24 died,  
representing a 46.2 percent mortality rate. The suburban Deerfield, 
Ill.-based company had projected 42.6 percent mortality for 
critically ill patients seeking emergency treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	The push to find a blood substitute has been intense because  
artificial blood could ease the effects of whole-blood shortages. 
Researchers say it lasts longer than conventional blood, eliminates 
the time-consuming need to match blood types and wipes out the risk 
of contamination with such viruses as HIV and hepatitis. 
</P>
<P>
	No company other than Baxter has conducted a no-consent  
experiment under the rule, according to FDA officials. 
</P>
<P>
	The new 1996 regulations require a level of community  
notification that is higher than most scientific studies, including 
community meetings, press releases and post-study follow-up. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet it's unlikely that any of the patients who wound up being  
transfused with the blood substitute in emergency rooms had been 
reached by the public notification, the Chicago Tribune reported 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Some say such notification cannot replace direct consent from  
patients or their relatives. 
</P>
<P>
	``Public notification means nothing,'' said Dr. Arthur Caplan,  
director of the Center for Bioethics at the University of 
Pennsylvania. ``I know people are enamored of it, but it means 
nothing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The problems with the HemAssist trial are prompting some medical  
ethicists to question the rule change. 
</P>
<P>
	``People get involved in something to their detriment without  
any knowledge of it,'' George Annas, a professor of health law at 
the Boston University School of Public Health, told the Tribune. 
``We use people. What's the justification for that?'' 
</P>
<P>
	A Baxter spokeswoman told the Tribune that no lawsuits have  
arisen from the blood substitute trial. 
</P>
<P>
	``The regulations worked in this instance,'' Mary Thomas said  
Sunday. ``We voluntarily stopped the trial early on at the first 
sign of unexpected results to insure patient safety.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas says Baxter is in favor of obtaining patient consent  
whenever possible. Yet company officials also believe it is 
important to advance lifesaving medical therapy for patients -- 
something impossible to do without the revised FDA regulations, 
Thomas said.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Prepares Annual Address </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Conceding that families with only one  
breadwinner need tax relief too, President Clinton is proposing a 
credit to offset costs borne by parents who choose to stay home and 
care for their children. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's budget proposal for fiscal 2000 will include a tax  
credit of up to $500 per child age 1 or younger, according to a 
White House official who spoke Sunday on condition of anonymity. It 
is expected to cost $1.3 billion over five years, allowing for an 
average tax credit of $178, the official said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton was expected to outline the proposal in his State of the  
Union address Tuesday night before a joint session of Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposal is part of a larger child care package that seeks a  
total of $18 billion over five years to aid working poor and middle 
class families. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, the president put forth a $22 billion child care  
package that was tied to revenue from the proposed tobacco 
settlement. But the proposal went nowhere because Republicans said 
it failed to address parents who do not work outside the home. 
</P>
<P>
	With this plan, the White House hoped to deflate that argument  
and give GOP leaders what amounts to a political dare. ``There's no 
excuse for Congress not acting on child care now,'' the official 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The child care package is the latest policy item to be previewed  
from Clinton's speech. Others have included plans to reduce 
violence against children, improve military readiness and food 
safety and meet Americans' long-term health care needs. But the 
White House has revealed little about how the president would 
ensure that Social Security remains solvent as the huge baby boom 
generation retires. 
</P>
<P>
	In yet another proposal expected to be in the speech, Health and  
Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala told The Washington Post in 
an interview appearing in Monday's editions that Clinton will call 
for $1 billion over five years to improve health care for many of 
the nation's 32 million uninsured adults. The money would be used 
to encourage community clinics and hospitals to work together to 
keep track of patients and make sure they get needed treatment. The 
administration has now made health proposals that would cost about 
$10 billion over five years 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton spent much of Sunday practicing his delivery of the  
State of the Union address. He rehearsed into the night, testing 
and retesting themes that are likely to resonate with members of 
Congress and the 70 million to 80 million Americans expected to 
watch on television. 
</P>
<P>
	The president donned a suit jacket and tie and rehearsed before  
about 20 aides, who tried to listen with the ears of lawmakers who 
voted to impeach him so the White House can try to anticipate 
reactions that can either help or hurt the president. ``The dynamic 
in the room matters,'' one senior official said privately. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton stood at a podium, his remarks queued on prompting  
devices; nearby were two computer terminals for making revisions. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're beyond drafts now,'' said White House spokesman Joe  
Lockhart. ``There were three or four real drafts, and there were 
considerable changes from draft to draft. They're in the stage now 
that they're just throwing out pages and writing in the margins.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On the Sunday television talk shows, some lawmakers renewed a  
plea for Clinton to skip the speech, noting they won't find it easy 
to segue from trying his impeachment case in the Senate chamber a 
few hours earlier. Still, they said they planned to be on hand to 
hear it. 
</P>
<P>
	``Quite frankly, I'd rather go to the dentist. But I intend to  
go,'' Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, said on ABC's ``This Week.'' ``I'm 
going to applaud. I'm going to be respectful. Despite all the 
political rhetoric, I don't hate Bill Clinton.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a letter Sunday, Republican leaders told the president they  
will be listening closely to what he says about tax cuts, defense 
spending, expanding local control over education dollars and 
overhauling Social Security ``without tax increases or benefit 
cuts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., and House Speaker  
Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., invited Clinton to submit a Social Security 
proposal before March 1, the date they said they have scheduled a 
joint House-Senate committee meeting to receive it. 
</P>
<P>
	``Although your presentation of the traditional State of the  
Union address will occur this year under extraordinary 
circumstances, we should not permit those circumstances to distract 
us from the nation's legislative agenda,'' Lott and Hastert wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposed child care credit would benefit an estimated 1.7  
million families. That would mean a family earning $30,000 per year 
with one working parent would be able to claim $500 in child care 
expenses, rather than the $250 they are allowed under current law. 
The amount of the credit declines as family income increases. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration official declined to reveal how the tax  
credit would be funded, other than to say it would be financed 
through ``a host of options'' being exercised in Clinton's budget 
and would not be tied to a tobacco tax increase. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's tax credit for stay-at-home parents is patterned after  
one offered last year by Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., the 
official said. The rest of the $18 billion package incorporates 
elements of a proposal by Sens. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, and John 
Chafee, R-R.I. 
</P>
<P>
	The Chafee-Hatch bill called for $15 billion to $16 billion over  
five years, and would have expanded the dependent-care tax credit 
for stay-at-home parents up to $900 per year per family.

<HEADLINE> Lawyer Convicted of Murdering Woman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WILMINGTON, Del. (AP) -- A jury on Sunday convicted a politically  
connected attorney of murdering his mistress and dumping her body 
at sea, rejecting his story that she was accidentally killed by 
another mistress in a jealous rage. 
</P>
<P>
	Jurors deliberated for three days before finding Thomas Capano  
guilty of killing Anne Marie Fahey, who was Gov. Thomas Carper's 
scheduling secretary. 
</P>
<P>
	Without a body, a weapon or any concrete evidence to prove how  
Ms. Fahey died, prosecutors used circumstantial evidence to show 
Capano had planned her death. Jurors had to believe the crime was 
premeditated to convict on the sole charge of first-degree murder. 
</P>
<P>
	Capano, 49, could be sentenced to death.  
</P>
<P>
	The jury reached a verdict shortly before 8 p.m. Saturday after  
three days of deliberation in the 12-week-long trial that exposed 
lurid details of Delaware's elite. Superior Court Judge William 
Swain Lee had said he would receive the verdict Sunday morning. 
</P>
<P>
	Capano stared stone-faced as the verdict -- ``guilty as charged''  
-- was read Sunday morning to a silent courtroom. Outside the room, 
people who couldn't get inside clapped and cheered. 
</P>
<P>
	Capano's mother, Marguerite, and Ms. Fahey's sister, Kathleen  
Fahey-Hosey, both burst into tears. 
</P>
<P>
	Testimony in the trial's sentencing phase will begin on  
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Capano admitted he stuffed Ms. Fahey's body in a cooler and  
threw it overboard from his brother's boat. But he insisted that 
another mistress had accidentally shot Ms. Fahey at his home in a 
jealous rage and that he got rid of the body to protect the woman. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors ridiculed that story and said Capano, a married man,  
killed Ms. Fahey because she wanted to end their secret three-year 
affair. 
</P>
<P>
	The trial had Delawareans transfixed, exposing sensational  
details about some of the most influential people in this usually 
staid financial center, with its tightly interlocking circles of 
law, politics and business. 
</P>
<P>
	Capano is a former prosecutor and legal counsel to Carper's  
predecessor, and his family operates a construction business that 
has built houses all over the Wilmington area. During the trial, 
Delaware's chief deputy attorney general took a leave of absence 
after acknowledging on the stand that he and Capano's other 
mistress had a sexual encounter that Capano arranged. 
</P>
<P>
	The trial also split Capano's close family. His brothers Gerard  
and Louis, who helped him dispose of evidence, testified against 
him, while his brother Joseph testified on his behalf. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors introduced passages from Ms. Fahey's diary,  
including the final entry, made a few months before she 
disappeared, in which she called Capano ``a controlling, 
manipulative, insecure, jealous maniac.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gerard Capano said his brother had complained of being extorted  
and asked whether he could use Gerard's boat if he killed someone. 
Gerard Capano testified that he took his brother in his boat 60 
miles off the New Jersey coast to get rid of the body and that they 
shot the cooler to try to make it sink. 
</P>
<P>
	A week later, fishermen found a pinkish-stained cooler with a  
slug hole in it. There was no sign of the body or the gun. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Fahey, 30, disappeared after she and Capano dined at an  
elegant Philadelphia restaurant on June 27, 1996. Capano long 
maintained he didn't know what happened to her. 
</P>
<P>
	But bloodstains were found in Capano's house and on the back  
seat of his Jeep. And investigators learned that Capano had 
replaced a rug and received help from one of his brothers in 
getting rid of a bloodstained sofa not long after Ms. Fahey 
vanished. 
</P>
<P>
	In a stunning turnaround, Capano said at his trial that Ms.  
Fahey was killed at his house and that he disposed of her body the 
next day. But he said that another mistress, Deborah MacIntyre, 
shot Ms. Fahey, and he panicked and ``basically made the wrong 
decision.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said he lied to protect Ms. MacIntyre, a former administrator  
at Wilmington's prestigious Tatnall School. She carried on an 
18-year affair with Capano, who had worked with her husband. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. MacIntyre denied she shot Ms. Fahey and said she wasn't even  
at Capano's house that night. Instead, she testified that Capano 
had her buy a gun for him a month before Ms. Fahey died. 
</P>
<P>
	In closing arguments, prosecutor Colm Connolly called Capano's  
story of one mistress killing another ``ludicrous.'' If Ms. Fahey 
died accidentally, Capano could simply have called authorities, 
Connolly said. 
</P>
<P>
	``If anybody was going to be given the benefit of the doubt, it  
was the defendant, with his political connections,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	While in prison awaiting trial, Capano was indicted on charges  
he tried to have Ms. MacIntyre and Gerard Capano killed. 
</P>
<P>
	As testimony about the death of her sister ended, Ms.  
Fahey-Hosey remarked: 
</P>
<P>
	``We have been surrounded by some very evil people.''

<HEADLINE> Ex-Wal-Mart Employees Awarded $20M </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALBANY, Ky. (AP) -- A jury has awarded $20 million to four former  
employees of a Wal-Mart store after deciding the company unfairly 
fired them for eating damaged nuts and candy. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton Circuit Court jury deliberated for about 90 minutes  
Friday before awarding each of the four workers $1 million for 
slander, $1 million for embarrassment and mental anguish and $3 
million in punitive damages. 
</P>
<P>
	The judgment was against both Wal-Mart and Monticello store  
manager Anthony Whitaker. 
</P>
<P>
	Virginia Stringer -- who also received $20,000 for loss of wages  
-- Reual Ed Angel, Donnie Brummett and Tina Sparks all were 
approaching their seven-year anniversaries at the store when they 
were fired in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	All were confronted by management with videotaped evidence they  
had eaten cashews and breath mints from packages that had been 
damaged in shipping, said their attorney, Larry Rogers of 
Monticello. 
</P>
<P>
	The items in question involved ``claims'' merchandise; goods  
that are damaged in shipment. With snacks, the torn or damaged 
packages cannot be sold at retail and the manufacturer doesn't want 
them back, Rogers said. 
</P>
<P>
	Wal-Mart claimed in court briefs and during the three-day trial  
that the four violated a company pilferage policy. 
</P>
<P>
	The tapes showed the four did eat a small of amount of nuts and  
mints. But the employees maintained they were following an 
unwritten policy in which such food was left in lounges for 
employees -- and managers -- to consume. 
</P>
<P>
	Louisville lawyer Donna Perry, who represented Wal-Mart,  
declined to comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Wal-Mart spokesman Mike Maher said the company was disappointed  
and was considering several options, including an appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	``We feel the monetary awards are just way too high,'' Maher  
said. ``... In no way, shape or form do we feel the verdict can be 
supported by the facts of the case. We still maintain we did 
nothing wrong.''.

<HEADLINE> Bell Atlantic Wants Pact Overturned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- After losing a bid to buy AirTouch  
Communications Inc., Bell Atlantic Corp. has asked a court to scrap 
a noncompetition agreement the two telecommunications companies 
established for an existing joint venture. 
</P>
<P>
	The suit was filed in federal court in San Francisco on Friday,  
the same day AirTouch reached agreement to be acquired by Britain's 
Vodafone Group PLC. The $56 billion cash-and-stock deal would 
create the world's biggest cellular phone company, to be called 
Vodafone AirTouch PLC. 
</P>
<P>
	Bell Atlantic, which initiated the bidding at the end of last  
year, already has a joint venture with AirTouch. In 1994, it formed 
PrimeCo Personal Communications with AirTouch and regional phone 
companies U S West Inc. and Nynex. Nynex later merged with Bell 
Atlantic. 
</P>
<P>
	Primeco is a digital wireless telephone service with more than  
700,000 customers in 30 U.S. cities, including Chicago, Miami and 
New Orleans. 
</P>
<P>
	After breaking off talks with AirTouch on Friday, Bell Atlantic  
went to court over a clause in the PrimeCo venture which prohibits 
the two companies from competing with one another, Bell Atlantic 
spokesman Jim Gerace said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Since we weren't able to make an acquisition work, this was a  
last resort, to exit out of that non-compete clause,'' Gerace said. 
</P>
<P>
	AirTouch spokesman Jonathan Marshall said the San  
Francisco-based company had not seen the suit and could not comment 
directly on it. 
</P>
<P>
	Bell Atlantic is currently working out details in its proposed  
$62.5 million combination with GTE Corp., a merger expected to be 
completed in the second half of 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	Marshall said that if the merger goes through, GTE wireless  
properties will overlap with PrimeCo properties in Houston; 
Tampa-St. Petersburg, Fla.; Norfolk-Virginia Beach, Va.; and 
Austin, Texas. GTE will overlap with AirTouch or other ventures in 
San Francisco, San Diego, Seattle, Cleveland and Cincinnati. 
</P>
<P>
	``They need to deal with those issues,'' said Marshall. ``One  
solution was a merger. Now they need to reconsider those options. 
We hope, as they do, that cooperation is more in their interest.'' 
</P>
<P>
	AirTouch serves customers throughout the western United States,  
while the New York-based Bell Atlantic dominates the Northeast. 
Analysts said a merger between the two would have allowed them to 
establish a nationwide cellular network, making them better able to 
take on telecom giant AT&AMP;T Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	It's a goal that's still feasible, Marshall said. ``It's  
possible to achieve the same result for customers through 
agreements and cooperation as opposed to a merger.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gerace declined to comment on reports that the new Vodafone  
AirTouch was interested in forming a partnership with Bell 
Atlantic, nor would he comment about the future of PrimeCo. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were partners Friday, we'll be partners Monday,'' said  
Gerace.

<HEADLINE> MarketWatch.com Stocks Soars in IPO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stock in MarketWatch.com Inc., which runs a  
popular online financial news site aligned with CBS, soared in its 
debut Friday as Internet-hungry investors jumped at the first new 
stock offering of 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares in the operator of the CBS.MarketWatch.com site closed at  
$97.50 -- nearly six times higher than their initial offering price 
of $17 -- on the Nasdaq Stock Market. The shares had ballooned to a 
high of $130 during the day. 
</P>
<P>
	The lust for stocks with any connection to the Internet bestowed  
the money-losing Web site operator with a $1.1 billion market value 
after just one day of trading. 
</P>
<P>
	But analysts believe MarketWatch has a stronger chance for  
success than most instant-hit Internet stocks, because it carries 
the trusted CBS brand name. The built-in promotion of its site on 
television provides a competitive advantage over most rivals. 
</P>
<P>
	``In an environment where so many online entities must build  
their brands from scratch, if you bring a brand like this to the 
table it gets immediate credibility,'' said Mark Hardie, an analyst 
at Forrester Research. 
</P>
<P>
	MarketWatch.com was founded in October 1997 as a joint venture  
of CBS Corp. and Data Broadcasting Corp. It competes with a huge 
array of financial news and data sites at a time when the demand 
for financial news and advice from all types of media -- 
particularly the Internet -- is exploding. 
</P>
<P>
	Media Metrix, a private Internet research firm, said  
CBS.MarketWatch.com had 1.4 million individual visitors in 
November, up from 1.2 million in October and 1 million in 
September. 
</P>
<P>
	In its regulatory filing, MarketWatch.com said the site had 2.2  
million visitors in October, compared to 785,000 in March. The 
company's figures are larger because they reflect repeat visitors, 
as well as international users, which are not part of the Media 
Metrix totals. 
</P>
<P>
	Like so many Internet stocks that gain immediate favor on Wall  
Street, MarketWatch.com is losing money. The company lost $8.2 
million on revenue of $4.5 million through the first nine months of 
1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Peony Kao, an analyst at Renaissance IPO Fund in Greenwich,  
Conn., said MarketWatch.com is unlikely to turn a profit before 
2002. Still, she said, among the rash of inflated Internet stocks 
MarketWatch.com does stand out because of its CBS affiliation. 
</P>
<P>
	CBS stock climbed 81 1/4 cents to $34.81 1/4 on the New York Stock  
Exchange. But Data Broadcasting shares, which had soared in advance 
of the MarketWatch.com offering, dropped $9.43 3/4, or 30 percent, to 
$21.75 on Nasdaq. 
</P>
<P>
	CBS and Data Broadcasting each own a 38 percent stake in  
MarketWatch.com after the offering of 2.75 million shares. 
MarketWatch plans to use proceeds from the stock sale to increase 
marketing of its site, pay off debt and pursue acquisitions or 
other alliances.

<HEADLINE> Norwegian Wins Women's Slalom </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. ANTON, Austria (AP) -- Trine Bakke of Norway earned her first  
World Cup victory Sunday, in a women's slalom over the difficult 
Kandahar course. 
</P>
<P>
	Bakke, whose previous best was second in last year's slalom at  
Salbach, negotiated the 46 gates down the steep and icy course in a 
two-run combined time of 1 minute, 22.84 seconds. Anja Paerson of 
Sweden was second, .04 seconds back. 
</P>
<P>
	Croatia's 17-year-old sensation, Janica Kostelic, was third at  
1:23.77. 
</P>
<P>
	Bakke was second after the first run, trailing Norway's Andrine  
Flemmen by .23 seconds. But Flemmen fell in the second run and 
Bakke had a brilliant run. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a very hard and steep course,'' Bakke said. ``It is  
great to know how it feels to win a race.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Six of the first 15 first-group starters failed to finish the  
first run, including Kristina Koznick of Burnsville, Minn., Martina 
Ertl of Germany and Urska Hrovat of Slovenia. 
</P>
<P>
	Only 32 of the 77 racers finished the first run. Six of 30 who  
started the second heat also fell. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was nervous this morning when I saw this steep and icy  
course,'' said Paerson, who won this season's second World Cup 
slalom at Mammoth Mountain, Calif. ``I usually go all out in every 
race, but this time I had to slow down in order to reach the bottom 
of the course.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kostelic, a World Cup rookie who also was third in the slalom  
opener at Park City, Utah, said, ``It was good for me to know I can 
do it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Overall World Cup leader Alexandra Meissnitzer of Austria  
finished 19th. Meissnitzer rarely starts in slaloms, but this time 
she collected valuable combined points. She leads the standings 
with 1,157 points, 280 more than runner-up Hilde Gerg of Germany. 
</P>
<P>
	Kostelic won the combined with a total time of 2:54.81.  
</P>
<P>
	Home-crowd favorite Anita Wachter dropped out in the first run.  
So did Sweden's Pernilla Wiberg, who had led the overall slalom 
standings but is now second with 365 points -- 31 behind Sabine 
Egger of Austria.

<HEADLINE> Researcher Says Wolves Helped Humans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Early humans became better hunters after they  
domesticated wolves about 135,000 years ago, an advantage that 
possibly helped them outlive Neanderthals and other rivals, 
according to a California Institute of Technology researcher. 
</P>
<P>
	The wolf's strength, stamina and acute hearing and sense of  
smell likely helped humans to hunt prey and overcome predators, 
especially at night, said John Allman, who specializes in 
evolutionary biology. 
</P>
<P>
	Domesticating wolves ``would have been a huge selective  
advantage for whatever human population did that because it would 
have allowed modern humans to move into areas that were previously 
inhospitable,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	By teaming up with domesticated wolves, the ancestors of modern  
Homo sapiens became better hunters and eventually were able to 
supplant Homo erectus and Neanderthal populations, Allman theorizes 
in his recently published book ``Evolving Brains.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Allman used a biological timeline, results from DNA studies and  
observations of human, wolf and dog behavior to support his 
conclusion. 
</P>
<P>
	``Early domesticated dogs probably looked just like wolves. You  
would expect that there wouldn't be too many differences,'' Allman 
said. ``Early dogs would have been performing very wolflike 
functions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In his book, Allman noted that scientific evidence indicates  
Homo sapiens lived in Africa, Neanderthals lived in Europe and 
Western Asia and a Homo erectus population likely lived in 
southeast Asia about 150,000 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The highly successful species of wolf, Canis lupus, also lived  
around the same time, but not in Africa. 
</P>
<P>
	Comparative DNA studies from modern humans indicate that Homo  
sapiens began migrating out of Africa about 140,000 years ago, 
probably encountering wolves in Asia, Allman said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Wolves were found throughout Eurasia and most of North  
America, one of the widest distribution of mammalian species, which 
suggests survivability,'' Allman said. 
</P>
<P>
	A recent study by University of California, Los Angeles  
biologist Robert Wayne, who compared the DNA of wolves, dogs and 
other canines around the world, showed that dogs evolved from 
wolves and that domestication of wolves began as early as 135,000 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``It wasn't such a huge amount to achieve this cooperativity  
between these two different species'' because wolves and humans 
shared similar social structures, Allman argued. 
</P>
<P>
	Allman, who has owned several generations of the same family of  
sheepdogs, first began noting the similarities as a graduate 
student studying anthropology 30 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	He noted that wolves have an extended family and a ``cooperative  
rearing strategy'' for their pups. A female wolf stays in the den 
and feeds the pups while other wolves go out to gather food and 
bring it back. 
</P>
<P>
	``That just struck me as perhaps having a bit in common with  
what early humans must have been like,'' Allman said. ``Engaging in 
cooperative rearing is pretty rare in mammals. Typically, in most 
mammals, the mother takes care of her offspring with little help 
from anybody else.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Also, wolf packs have dominant members. After a pack takes down  
prey, the dominant hunter controls who gets a share of the carcass. 
Some of the more submissive wolves sometimes must beg for a piece. 
</P>
<P>
	Allman suggests that humans learned to make wolves defer to them  
by taking the role of the dominant wolf. Likewise, domesticated 
wolves saw humans as pack members who brought food to their pups, 
he argued.

<HEADLINE> Falcons Defense Shuts Down Vikes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- For nearly 42 minutes Sunday, the Atlanta  
Falcons did the unexpected: They shut down the Minnesota Vikings. 
</P>
<P>
	Randy Moss, Randall Cunningham, Cris Carter, Robert Smith &AMP; Co.  
managed only seven points after halftime -- remarkable for an 
offense that scored an NFL-record 556 points during the regular 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	``At halftime, we knew we could play with them,'' linebacker  
Jessie Tuggle said after the Falcons advanced to the Super Bowl for 
the first time with a 30-27 overtime victory over the Vikings. 
``After the first half, we said, `OK guys, they threw their best 
shot at us and we're only down by six (20-14).''' 
</P>
<P>
	``Nobody believed in us,'' end Lester Archambeau added.  
``Everybody was saying we're second-rate. I don't know what they 
were thinking.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Vikings scored on their first four possession against the  
Falcons, who fell behind 20-7 when Gary Anderson kicked a 35-yard 
field goal late in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
	Minnesota, showing no respect for a defense that ranked fourth  
in the NFL in points allowed, got the ball back at its 17 with just 
over a minute remaining and went for more points. That was the 
turning point. 
</P>
<P>
	Cunningham dropped back to pass, but defensive end Chuck Smith  
batted the ball out of his hand and Travis Hall recovered. On the 
next play, Chris Chandler threw a 14-yard touchdown pass to Terance 
Mathis. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of guys stepped up and made some plays,'' Tuggle said.  
``That's how it's been all year long. Not just me or any other 
individual. It's been a different guy each and every week making 
big plays. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've been headhunters. We've been running to the football,  
creating havoc all year long. We didn't fall apart. We stayed 
together and went out there and executed and won the game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the second half, Atlanta cornerbacks Ray Buchanan and Michael  
Booker got more physical against Moss, who set an NFL rookie record 
with 17 touchdown receptions. They jammed the 6-foot-4 receiver at 
the line, preventing him from getting loose for those long catches 
that were the trademark of his spectacular season. 
</P>
<P>
	Moss had five receptions for 71 yards in the first two quarters.  
He managed only one catch for 4 yards the rest of the way. 
</P>
<P>
	``We played more aggressively,'' said Booker, a second-year  
player who was starting because of an injury to Ronnie Bradford. 
``It was very important for me to get my hands on Moss. I thought I 
did a fine job getting my hands on him so he was not able to catch 
that deep ball like he had been doing. I felt if I could do that, 
we could win the game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cunningham praised the Falcons secondary for mixing its  
coverages after halftime, taking Moss totally out of the game and 
forcing Minnesota to look to lesser-known receivers such as Andrew 
Glover, Matthew Hatchette and Greg DeLong. 
</P>
<P>
	``They did an excellent job,'' said Cunningham, who was 29-of-48  
for 266 yards. ``Their scheme was sound and good. We were able to 
move the ball and put 27 points on the board, but in the end they 
were the ones who won the game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Added Moss, ``The thing I'm disappointed about right now is the  
lead we had and with the explosive offense we have, we couldn't 
make it happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Atlanta defense came up with one huge play after another,  
allowing only a 5-yard touchdown pass from Cunningham to Hatchette 
early in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Even when the Vikings won the coin toss to begin overtime, the  
Falcons didn't waver. They stopped Minnesota on two drives, the 
most heart-stopping moment coming when Cunningham went deep for 
Moss but safety Eugene Robinson got the best of a jump ball and 
knocked the pass away. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it was just a little bit more desire, more than  
anything,'' linebacker Cornelius Bennett said. ``This is a special 
football team, special guys doing special things when it counts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Falcons offense, which put the defense in bad position with  
two first-half fumbles, appreciated the effort on the other side of 
the line. 
</P>
<P>
	``They have a lot of pride other there,'' center Robbie Tobeck  
said. ``I knew they were going to step up and make plays when they 
needed to make plays. 
</P>
<P>
	``We made just enough plays to get it done.''

	NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Tornadoes with damaging winds, hail and  
rain moved through parts of western and central Tennessee Sunday 
night, killing four people and injuring 60. 
</P>
<P>
	Three people were killed in Madison County in the western part  
of the state, Tennessee Emergency Management Agency spokesman Kurt 
Pickering said. At least 56 people were taken to a hospital, and 11 
were in critical condition, hospital spokeswoman Jan Boud said. 
</P>
<P>
	Power outages were reported in many areas as high winds damaged  
homes and snapped tree limbs and power lines. 
</P>
<P>
	The storm moved across the state at about 50 mph, National  
Weather Service meteorologist Jim Moser said. It reached Nashville 
at about 8:30 p.m. and dissipated as it headed east. 
</P>
<P>
	About 30 homes were damaged or destroyed in Henderson County,  
said Michael Stanford, the county's assistant fire chief. A woman's 
body was found in the ruins of her home. Her husband was seriously 
hurt. 
</P>
<P>
	Three others in west Tennessee also were hurt.

 *Hockey Officials Have Been Preparing Lawsuit    	
</P>
<P>
	CALGARY, Alberta (AP) -- Internal Canadian Hockey Association  
documents show the governing body for hockey in Canada has been 
working for months to prepare for a lawsuit filed by an ex-Swift 
Current Broncos player sexually abused by former coach Graham 
James. 
</P>
<P>
	The victim, who cannot be identified, is one of two people James  
pleaded guilty to abusing between 1982 and 1994. The other was 
former NHL player Sheldon Kennedy. 
</P>
<P>
	The suit, filed Friday in Regina against James and 23 other  
parties, claims hockey officials knowingly ignored James' actions 
for years. 
</P>
<P>
	In the statement of claim, the plaintiff names 23 individuals  
and organizations who could have prevented James from coaching in 
the Western Hockey League because they allegedly knew that ``James 
sexually assaulted, molested, harassed and abused his players.''

 *Ottawa, Provinces Turn Up Heat on Health Care    	
</P>
<P>
	OTTAWA (AP) -- With a month to go before the federal budget,  
Ottawa and the provinces are stoking the fires in a long-simmering 
feud over how to cure the country's ailing health system. 
</P>
<P>
	Everybody agrees on the basic prescription: more cash.  
</P>
<P>
	But they disagree on how much cash, precisely what to spend it  
on and which level of government will get to impose its priorities. 
</P>
<P>
	The seemingly endless dispute has frayed the nerves of political  
insiders and left the general public baffled. 
</P>
<P>
	Prime Minister Jean Chretien did nothing to advance it last  
week. 
</P>
<P>
	After months of portraying investment in health care as a top  
priority, he was suddenly equivocal on whether he would boost 
transfer payments to the provinces.

 *Bureaucratic Double-Bind Delays First Whale Sanctuary    	
</P>
<P>
	IQALUIT, Northwest Territories (AP) -- Canada is poised to create  
its first sanctuary for bowhead whales -- 16 years after the idea 
was first proposed by a remote Inuit community halfway up the 
northeast coast of Baffin Island. 
</P>
<P>
	But Igalirtuuq, a marine preserve that would protect the largest  
spawning and feeding grounds for bowheads in the eastern Arctic, 
has been delayed yet again by a bureaucratic double-bind over 
funding. 
</P>
<P>
	The idea of Igalirtuuq began in the early 1980s when the  
community of Clyde River passed a vote calling for protection of 
the rich whale grounds off its shore and some old whaling camps 
along the coastline. 
</P>
<P>
	A land claim stipulates that any new parks must have an  
agreement on benefits for the local people. A benefits deal -- and 
the cost of implementing it -- is what's holding up Igalirtuuq. 
</P>
<P>
	Talks broke off when Inuit negotiators said the Canadian  
Wildlife Service's offer wasn't rich enough. The service said it 
doesn't have any more money.

 *Residents Cheer Snow Removal

	TORONTO (AP) -- Residents heaved a collective sigh of relief  
Sunday as Operation Cleanup began clearing away this month's record 
snowfall. 
</P>
<P>
	All month, residents have griped about the slow pace of snow  
removal. 
</P>
<P>
	As Sunday dawned clear and sunny, more than 300 people divided  
into 31 crews were hauling snow from clogged streets. 
</P>
<P>
	Police, soldiers and city workers knocked on residents' doors  
and gave them four hours to move their cars from the street. Those 
that weren't got a ``friendly tow'' -- one without a ticket. 
</P>
<P>
	The plan worked since fewer than 10 cars were towed, said Doug  
Reid, manager of media relations for the city.

 *Weak Opposition Could Be Tobin's Best Weapon    	
</P>
<P>
	ST. JOHN'S, Newfoundland (AP) -- Newfoundland Premier Brian Tobin  
is expected to roll the dice as early as today and gamble on a trip 
to the polls two full years before he has to. 
</P>
<P>
	But aside from the odd smattering of public criticism and cries  
of political opportunism, it's hard to find anyone prepared to bet 
against the governing Liberals. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are no signs the opposition has gotten its act  
together,'' said Steve Tomblin, a political scientist at Memorial 
University in St. John's. 
</P>
<P>
	``If there was a strong opposition raising the right questions,  
he might wait to go early. As it is, there could be another massive 
majority.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Liberals hold 36 of 48 seats in the province and public  
opinion polls released last month indicate they have overwhelming 
support.

<HEADLINE> Pentagon Drops Bid To Review Book </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Pentagon dropped a demand that a former  
U.N. weapons inspector critical of U.S. policy in Iraq submit 
advance manuscripts of a book he is writing on his experiences as a 
member of the inspection team working to disarm Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
	David Rigby, chief of public affairs at the Defense Threat  
Reduction Agency, said Sunday a contracting officer wrote to Scott 
Ritter last month that he was obligated to submit his planned work 
for a pre-publication security review. 
</P>
<P>
	Ritter resigned as a U.N. inspector last summer and has  
complained in Congress and elsewhere that the Clinton 
administration's policy to disarm President Saddam Hussein's Iraqi 
military is ineffectual and wrong-headed. 
</P>
<P>
	In response to a New York Times report Sunday in which Ritter's  
attorney, Matthew L. Lifflander, objected to the Pentagon agency's 
letter, Rigby said officials determined that since Ritter no longer 
is under contract to the Pentagon, he has no legal obligation to 
submit writings for review. 
</P>
<P>
	``We would work with him to ensure that there is no release of  
classified material,'' Rigby said. ``But that is an offer, not a 
demand.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ritter had been under contract to the On-Site Inspection Agency,  
an arm of the Defense Department, when he was a member of UNSCOM, 
the U.N. Special Commission carrying out the Iraqi program. The 
U.S. inspection agency has since merged with other Pentagon 
agencies into the Defense Threat Reduction Agency. 
</P>
<P>
	Ritter is a retired Marine Corps intelligence officer.  
</P>
<P>
	Rigby said the Dec. 23 letter was sent in good faith, because of  
fear that Ritter might inadvertently disclose classified 
information in his book, to be published this spring by Simon &AMP; 
Schuster. It was a mistake to indicate that Ritter was legally 
obliged to submit his writings in advance, Rigby said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Times report quoted Lifflander as saying Ritter was unlikely  
to agree to a prepublication security review and if the Pentagon 
pressed the matter it could end up in court. Lifflander also was 
quoted as accusing the Pentagon of trying to intimidate Ritter into 
silence. 
</P>
<P>
	Rigby rejected any suggestion of attempting to intimidate  
Ritter. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are not trying to hassle him,'' Rigby said.  
</P>
<P>
	If Ritter refuses the Pentagon's offer to check his book for  
classified material in advance of its publication, the matter will 
be dropped, the spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Times quoted Lifflander as saying Ritter's book would focus  
mainly on his views about Saddam and how the United States and the 
United Nations should deal with him. In frequent public statements, 
Ritter has been critical of American policy toward Iraq, in some 
cases saying U.S. policy has undermined the work of the U.N. 
Special Commission inspectors.

<HEADLINE> Sydney Olympic Panel Vows Honesty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- Sydney's Olympic organizing committee  
promised corporate sponsors of the 2000 Summer Games that its 
winning bid was free of bribery or corruption. 
</P>
<P>
	No one ``should have reason to believe that Sydney has cause to  
be embarrassed about the integrity of its bid,'' Sandy Hollway, the 
spokesman for the Sydney Organizing Committee for the Olympic 
Games, said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	His statement follows a weekend of disclosures about corruption  
allegations involving the Salt Lake City and Nagano winter 
Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	``No allegations have been made about Sydney's conduct and I am  
comforted by the public assurances of people central to the bid 
that all actions were proper,'' Hollway said in a public letter to 
Olympic sponsors. 
</P>
<P>
	Hollway said SOCOG supports the International Olympic  
Committee's investigation into the allegations, and also advocates 
reform of the bidding process, which has been proposed by the IOC. 
</P>
<P>
	Caltex, a joint venture of the U.S. oil companies Texaco and  
Chevron, ended talks last week about becoming a sponsor of the 2000 
Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	After 12 months of negotiations, Caltex withdrew from an  
arrangement that would have set up a $6.3 million sponsorship deal, 
saying it had already signed up as a sponsor of the U.S. Olympic 
team and partner for the 2002 Salt Lake City Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	Faced with a $200 million shortfall in anticipated sponsorship,  
New South Wales state Olympics Minister Michael Knight said last 
week he expects swift action to assure prospective sponsors that 
the games will not be further tarnished. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think it's a problem yet (with sponsors), but it could  
become a problem,'' Knight said in an interview with The Associated 
Press. ``If the (Olympic) brand continues to be sullied, then 
obviously that will impact on future sponsorship opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's very important that the IOC move quickly to expel  
members, if any members are proved to have taken bribes, and that 
they move quickly to put some confidence back into the bidding 
process.''

<HEADLINE> Group Says It Set Oregon Fire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- An underground group of environmental  
activists claimed responsibility for a December fire at the U.S. 
Forest Industries headquarters in Medford. 
</P>
<P>
	In a fax sent to The Associated Press late Saturday, The Earth  
Liberation Front said the Dec. 26 fire was ``in retribution for all 
the wild forests and animals lost to feed the wallets of greedy'' 
corporations. 
</P>
<P>
	``They have a clear political and social purpose, that's to end  
the exploitative and abusive industry practices at hand,'' said 
Craig Rosebraugh of the Portland-based Liberation Collective, who 
serves as a spokesman for the underground group. 
</P>
<P>
	Police declined to comment until they could investigate.  
</P>
<P>
	Company President Jerry Bramwell said Sunday he had never been  
contacted by the group claiming responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is a difference between claiming it and it actually  
being a fact,'' he said. ``The Republic of Ireland has gone through 
that on numerous occasions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The fax read, in part: ``On the foggy night after Christmas when  
everyone was digesting their turkey and pie, Santa's ELFs dropped 
two five-gallon buckets of diesel/unleaded mix and a one gallon jug 
with cigarette delays; which proved to be more than enough to get 
this party started.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The office that burned was headquarters for four mills -- a White  
City veneer mill, a Grants Pass plywood mill, a stud mill in 
Colorado and a sawmill in Florida. Damage was estimated at 
$500,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Last fall, ELF claimed responsibility for an Oct. 12 fire at  
Vail, Colo., that destroyed four ski lifts, a restaurant, a picnic 
facility and a utility building. 
</P>
<P>
	ELF members also claimed responsibility for arson fires two  
years ago at two ranger stations in the Willamette National Forest 
in Oregon.

<HEADLINE> Japan's Account Surplus Off 5.3 Pct. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japan's broadest measure of trade fell in November,  
declining 5.3 percent from a year ago, the government said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The current account surplus, unadjusted for seasonal factors,  
was at $10.6 billion in November, the Finance Ministry announced. 
</P>
<P>
	The decline ended six straight months of monthly year-on-year  
increases in the surplus. 
</P>
<P>
	The current account measures the difference between income from  
foreign sources and foreign obligations payable, excluding net 
capital investment. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan has come under increasing pressure to revive its sluggish  
economy to import more goods and cap the surplus.

	Senate Jurors Spar Over Witnesses

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Awaiting the White House defense, Senate  
jurors sparred Sunday over whether witnesses should testify at 
President Clinton's impeachment trial. Democrats pledged to call 
their own witnesses, including Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr 
and informant Linda Tripp, if the Republicans press forward. The 
trial resumes Tuesday, a few hours before Clinton is to deliver the 
State of the Union address to Congress, with White House lawyers 
defending the president and saying that even if he did lie about 
his relationship with Monica Lewinsky, the offense is not grave 
enough to be removed from office.

generals to Belgrade Sunday to impress upon Yugoslav authorities 
the gravity of the situation. NATO called the killings a ``flagrant 
violation of international humanitarian law.'' The threat of NATO 
airstrikes, hanging over the heads of Serb authorities since 
October, remained an option Sunday as Serb forces launched a new 
attack on the ethnic Albanian village of Racak, where the massacre 
took place. Reports were emerging of attacks on other nearby 
communities. NATO ambassadors held an emergency session at alliance 
headquarters Sunday to decide on a strategy for dealing with the

<HEADLINE>  For Vikings, Offense Vanished </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- For half a game, they were the same old  
Minnesota Vikings, the high-flying offense that broke the NFL 
scoring record. Then it all vanished, along with their Super Bowl 
aspirations. 
</P>
<P>
	Unstoppable all season, the Vikings fizzled offensively after  
building a 20-7 lead late in the second quarter of Sunday's NFC 
championship game. That shocking failure, and Gary Anderson's first 
missed field goal in more than a year, led to their shocking 30-27 
overtime loss to the Atlanta Falcons. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our offense was supposed to have been so explosive, but we  
just couldn't make it happen in the clutch,'' said receiver Randy 
Moss, the exciting rookie who had fueled Minnesota's scoring binge 
this season. 
</P>
<P>
	The disappearance of Moss in the second half was perhaps the  
biggest key for the Vikings, who were playing in the NFC title game 
for the first time in 11 years and trying to get back to the Super 
Bowl for the first time since the 1976 season. 
</P>
<P>
	Moss, who led the NFL with a rookie-record 17 TD catches this  
season, had five catches for 71 yards as the Vikings built their 
20-7 lead on Anderson's field goal with 2:45 left in the second 
quarter. He had just one catch for 4 yards the rest of the way. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were taking me out of the game,'' Moss said. ``When you  
take a guy out of the game, other people have to step up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For the first time this season, no one did.  
</P>
<P>
	Minnesota's only points after halftime came on Matthew  
Hatchette's 5-yard touchdown catch with 13:41 remaining in the 
fourth quarter. The Vikings, who were favored by 11 points, led 
27-17 at that point. 
</P>
<P>
	They had the ball five more times after that, but were able to  
sustain only one more drive. 
</P>
<P>
	That came after their unsung defense, badly depleted in the  
second half by injuries to linebackers Ed McDaniel and Dixon 
Edwards and with All-Pro defensive lineman John Randle limited 
because of a bad knee, stopped the Falcons on downs at the 
Minnesota 24 with 6:07 left in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	The Vikings led 27-20 at that point and embarked on what looked  
like the clinching drive. Robert Smith, stuffed all day by Atlanta, 
carried five times for 45 yards -- he had 15 carries for 27 yards 
before that drive -- to help the Vikings to a second-and-6 at the 
Atlanta 20. 
</P>
<P>
	The drive stalled, but the Vikings still had Anderson, their  
``Perfect Man,'' lining up for a clinching 38-yard field goal 
attempt. 
</P>
<P>
	Anderson had made all 94 of his kicks during the regular season,  
including 35 field goals, and he was 7-for-7 (with two field goals) 
in last weekend's win over Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
	But this attempt sailed barely left. That gave Atlanta life, and  
they drove to the tying touchdown with 49 seconds left in 
regulation. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the Vikings won the coin toss in overtime -- but they  
fizzled again. 
</P>
<P>
	``Offensively, I think we did all we could do,'' quarterback  
Randall Cunningham said. ``We didn't have anything left in us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Vikings managed just one first down on each of their  
overtime possessions before Morton Andersen finished them with his 
38-yard field goal with 3:08 left in the first overtime, silencing 
the raucous crowd of 64,060, the largest ever to see a playoff game 
in Minnesota. 
</P>
<P>
	``The thing I'm disappointed about right now is with the lead we  
have and with the explosive offense we have, we didn't make it 
happen,'' said Moss, who was bothered -- but he said not slowed -- by 
a stomach injury. 
</P>
<P>
		   The loss made the Vikings the first team to go 15-1 in the  
regular season without winning the Super Bowl. San Francisco won it 
in 1984 and Chicago in 1985, and the Vikings seemed almost a lock 
to at least get their after scoring 556 points in the regular 
season and routing the Cardinals 41-21 last weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	Playing in a conference championship game for the first time in  
his 13-year career, Cunningham seemed to be most affected by 
Atlanta's determination to prevent the quick strike by taking away 
Moss. 
</P>
<P>
	The NFL's top-rated passer during the regular season, Cunningham  
was 15-for-21 for 144 yards and a touchdown, a 31-yarder to Moss, 
to help the Vikings to a 20-14 halftime lead. 
</P>
<P>
	But he finished 29-for-48 for 266 yards. He didn't throw an  
interception, but he lost two fumbles -- neither really his fault. 
The first helped the Falcons back into the game late in the second 
quarter. The second, at the Vikings 30 with 7:30 left in regulation 
and Minnesota up 27-20, didn't hurt the Vikings as the defense 
stopped Atlanta on downs. 
</P>

<HEADLINE>  For Vikings, Offense Vanished </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- For half a game, they were the same old  
Minnesota Vikings, the high-flying offense that broke the NFL 
scoring record. Then it all vanished, along with their Super Bowl 
aspirations. 
</P>
<P>
	Unstoppable all season, the Vikings fizzled offensively after  
building a 20-7 lead late in the second quarter of Sunday's NFC 
championship game. That shocking failure, and Gary Anderson's first 
missed field goal in more than a year, led to their shocking 30-27 
overtime loss to the Atlanta Falcons. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our offense was supposed to have been so explosive, but we  
just couldn't make it happen in the clutch,'' said receiver Randy 
Moss, the exciting rookie who had fueled Minnesota's scoring binge 
this season. 
</P>
<P>
	The disappearance of Moss in the second half was perhaps the  
biggest key for the Vikings, who were playing in the NFC title game 
for the first time in 11 years and trying to get back to the Super 
Bowl for the first time since the 1976 season. 
</P>
<P>
	Moss, who led the NFL with a rookie-record 17 TD catches this  
season, had five catches for 71 yards as the Vikings built their 
20-7 lead on Anderson's field goal with 2:45 left in the second 
quarter. He had just one catch for 4 yards the rest of the way. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were taking me out of the game,'' Moss said. ``When you  
take a guy out of the game, other people have to step up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For the first time this season, no one did.  
</P>
<P>
	Minnesota's only points after halftime came on Matthew  
Hatchette's 5-yard touchdown catch with 13:41 remaining in the 
fourth quarter. The Vikings, who were favored by 11 points, led 
27-17 at that point. 
</P>
<P>
	They had the ball five more times after that, but were able to  
sustain only one more drive. 
</P>
<P>
	That came after their unsung defense, badly depleted in the  
second half by injuries to linebackers Ed McDaniel and Dixon 
Edwards and with All-Pro defensive lineman John Randle limited 
because of a bad knee, stopped the Falcons on downs at the 
Minnesota 24 with 6:07 left in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	The Vikings led 27-20 at that point and embarked on what looked  
like the clinching drive. Robert Smith, stuffed all day by Atlanta, 
carried five times for 45 yards -- he had 15 carries for 27 yards 
before that drive -- to help the Vikings to a second-and-6 at the 
Atlanta 20. 
</P>
<P>
	The drive stalled, but the Vikings still had Anderson, their  
``Perfect Man,'' lining up for a clinching 38-yard field goal 
attempt. 
</P>
<P>
	Anderson had made all 94 of his kicks during the regular season,  
including 35 field goals, and he was 7-for-7 (with two field goals) 
in last weekend's win over Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
	But this attempt sailed barely left. That gave Atlanta life, and  
they drove to the tying touchdown with 49 seconds left in 
regulation. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the Vikings won the coin toss in overtime -- but they  
fizzled again. 
</P>
<P>
	``Offensively, I think we did all we could do,'' quarterback  
Randall Cunningham said. ``We didn't have anything left in us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Vikings managed just one first down on each of their  
overtime possessions before Morton Andersen finished them with his 
38-yard field goal with 3:08 left in the first overtime, silencing 
the raucous crowd of 64,060, the largest ever to see a playoff game 
in Minnesota. 
</P>
<P>
	``The thing I'm disappointed about right now is with the lead we  
have and with the explosive offense we have, we didn't make it 
happen,'' said Moss, who was bothered -- but he said not slowed -- by 
a stomach injury. 
</P>
<P>
		   The loss made the Vikings the first team to go 15-1 in the  
regular season without winning the Super Bowl. San Francisco won it 
in 1984 and Chicago in 1985, and the Vikings seemed almost a lock 
to at least get their after scoring 556 points in the regular 
season and routing the Cardinals 41-21 last weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	Playing in a conference championship game for the first time in  
his 13-year career, Cunningham seemed to be most affected by 
Atlanta's determination to prevent the quick strike by taking away 
Moss. 
</P>
<P>
	The NFL's top-rated passer during the regular season, Cunningham  
was 15-for-21 for 144 yards and a touchdown, a 31-yarder to Moss, 
to help the Vikings to a 20-14 halftime lead. 
</P>
<P>
	But he finished 29-for-48 for 266 yards. He didn't throw an  
interception, but he lost two fumbles -- neither really his fault. 
The first helped the Falcons back into the game late in the second 
quarter. The second, at the Vikings 30 with 7:30 left in regulation 
and Minnesota up 27-20, didn't hurt the Vikings as the defense 
stopped Atlanta on downs. 
</P>
<P>
	That's when the Vikings responded with their drive to set up  
Anderson's stunning miss. And that turned out to be all the spark 
that was left in the most potent offense the NFL has ever seen. 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe in some respects that makes it even more  
disappointing,'' said Anderson, struggling to contain his emotions 
in the Vikings tomblike locker room. ``We had such tremendous 
expectations, that makes it 10 times more disappointing.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton, Gores Share Spotlight </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- In this budget season, preceding the 2000  
campaign season, President Clinton is sharing the political wealth 
not only with Vice President Al Gore, but with Tipper too. 
</P>
<P>
	Both of the Gores, who hope to win the White House in 2000, are  
being given their own slices of the spotlight this year as the 
Clinton administration unveiled its spending plans for the coming 
budget cycle. 
</P>
<P>
	And both of the Gores will be at Clinton's side when he and  
first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton stage high-profile pep rallies in 
Buffalo, N.Y., and suburban Philadelphia the morning after the 
State of the Union address. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Gore traveled last week to New Hampshire, that  
all-important political bellwether, to unveil the president's 
budget plans -- a proposed $358 million, or 24 percent spending hike 
-- for state grants on mental health, her signature issue. Clinton 
would seek another $13 million to start a national pilot project 
giving free school breakfasts to low-income students, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Gore also announced $869,000 in federal weatherization  
assistance for low-income families, giving local leaders the good 
news that 640 New Hampshire families would get help making their 
homes energy efficient. 
</P>
<P>
	The privilege of unveiling a proposed $700 million in tax  
credits to finance suburban parks and green areas went to the vice 
president last week. 
</P>
<P>
	Such announcements, whether or not Congress ever follows up with  
the funds, are used to cement ties with friendly interest groups 
who might someday return the favor with campaign donations. 
</P>
<P>
	But White House press secretary Joe Lockhart insisted the Gores  
are pitching in only to ease the president's load when there are so 
many budget items to highlight. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have a lot of things going in and only so many days the  
president can do events,'' Lockhart said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton himself is more explicit about the strategy to anoint  
Gore. 
</P>
<P>
	At a Democratic party dinner Friday, Clinton called his  
handpicked successor ``far and away, not even close, the most 
influential person ..., achieving more for the American people than 
anyone who has ever held his position in the entire history of the 
republic.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Such superlatives will be trumpeted ``increasingly in the months  
ahead,'' Clinton promised. After all, 2000 is just 11 months away. 
</P>
<P>
	By the way, Clinton added, don't hold any of that campaign  
finance or Monica Lewinsky stuff against Gore. ``Any mistakes we 
made,'' he told his partisans, ``were my fault.''

<HEADLINE> Dems Warn They'll Call Witnesses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Awaiting the White House defense, Senate  
jurors sparred Sunday over whether witnesses should testify at 
President Clinton's impeachment trial. Democrats pledged to call 
their own witnesses, including independent counsel Kenneth Starr 
and informant Linda Tripp, if the Republicans press forward. 
</P>
<P>
	``It will be a spectacle. It will go on and on, '' Sen. Paul  
Wellstone, D-Minn., said. 
</P>
<P>
	The trial resumes Tuesday, a few hours before Clinton is to  
deliver the State of the Union address to Congress, with White 
House lawyers defending the president and saying that even if he 
did lie about his relationship with Monica Lewinsky, the offense is 
not grave enough to be removed from office. 
</P>
<P>
	White House lawyers met Sunday to work on the president's  
defense. Clinton, meanwhile, spent the day preparing for his 
Tuesday night State of the Union address. 
</P>
<P>
	Following the White House presentation and a period for senators  
to ask questions, the Senate set aside time next week for votes on 
motions, including House managers' demands that they be allowed to 
call witnesses and an expected Democratic push for dismissal. 
</P>
<P>
	Nearly one-fifth of the Senate -- 19 senators in all -- made the  
round of the Sunday talk shows. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the witness debate, partisan lines also were  
drawn on the legitimacy of the case against Clinton, with 
Republicans saying House prosecutors last week presented convincing 
evidence that the president committed perjury and obstruction of 
justice. Democrats said they'd heard nothing worthy of conviction 
and again pushed the option of censure. 
</P>
<P>
	The House prosecutors mentioned Ms. Lewinsky, White House  
secretary Betty Currie and Clinton confidant Vernon Jordan as 
likely witnesses. Democrats say the summoning of witnesses could 
snowball and drag out the trial for months. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is not an exaggeration: If you go that route, ... we may be  
talking May or June before we finish this trial,'' Sen. Christopher 
Dodd, D-Conn., said on NBC's ``Meet the Press.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats made clear they would contribute to expanding the  
witness list. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd be very interested in maybe having Linda Tripp, maybe  
having a whole host of people, ... and Ken Starr, all of whom might 
shed enormous light as to how it is we got here,'' said Sen. John 
Kerry, D-Mass. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I am any reader of the tea leaves, front and center is  
going to be Kenneth Starr, and we will go through prosecutorial 
abuse,'' Sen. Robert Torricelli, D-N.J., said on CBS' ``Face the 
Nation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans pointed out that a majority vote will be required  
for accepting each witness. ``We are not going to let this spin out 
of control,'' Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said on CBS. 
</P>
<P>
	That Republicans would let the trial go on interminably, when  
the nation wants a quick conclusion ``assumes that we Republicans 
are singularly stupid,'' Sen. Bob Bennett, R-Utah, said on CNN's 
``Late Edition.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Torricelli made clear that the bipartisan spirit the Senate has  
maintained so far in the trial could disintegrate if House 
prosecutors are permitted to call witnesses but those called by the 
White House are rejected. 
</P>
<P>
	Several of the 13 House prosecutors stressed they have made no  
decision on what witnesses they would call. Witnesses are crucial, 
Rep. Asa Hutchinson, R-Ark., said on ABC's ``This Week,'' because 
``I don't think you could obtain a conviction or I could clearly 
ask for a conviction until we have testimony.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, said that in their three days of  
arguments House prosecutors ``presented a powerful case'' and the 
White House will have a heavy burden rebutting it. ``I don't think 
you can just sweep away the House's case. I think a lot of people 
were very impressed,'' he said on NBC. 
</P>
<P>
	But Wellstone, also on NBC, said ``the House has not made its  
case'' for conviction and ``there is nowhere close to 67 senators 
in my judgment who are going to vote to remove the president.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At least 12 Democrats would have to join the 55 Senate  
Republicans to get the two-thirds vote needed to convict. Of 10 
Democrats interviewed Sunday on the news programs, not one signaled 
more sympathy toward conviction after hearing the House arguments. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've sat for three days and haven't heard anything new. I  
don't think we'll hear anything new when the White House makes a 
presentation,'' Sen. Byron Dorgan, D-N.D., said on ``Fox News 
Sunday.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats continued to argue that the best outcome would be to  
approve a resolution censuring Clinton for his conduct with Ms. 
Lewinsky. ``We can't take a bye on the sort of moral judgment or 
value judgments that are involved here,'' Kerry said. 
</P>
<P>
	But Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, said he'd oppose a censure motion,  
even if the Senate fails to come up with the vote to convict. 
``Censure is to cover politicians,'' he said on ABC. ``I don't need 
any cover.''

<P>
	JERUSALEM (AP) -- Shlomo Baum, a founder of a feared Israeli  
commando unit and a noted right-wing activist, died Sunday. He was 
70. 
</P>
<P>
	The cause of death was not disclosed.  
</P>
<P>
	Baum was one of the founders of the 101 unit, which carried out  
bloody reprisal raids in Jordanian-held territory in the 1950s. The 
unit was led by Ariel Sharon, now Israel's foreign minister. 
</P>
<P>
	Baum lived in the mixed Jewish-Arab neighborhood of Abu Tor, and  
was noted for his shaved head, his muscular physique and a talent 
for a controversial turn of phrase. 
</P>
<P>
	Baum boasted that he always kept his pistol loaded. ``I don't

	DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- David W. Belin, a prominent Des Moines  
attorney who served as a top investigator to the Warren Commission, 
died Sunday from head injuries suffered in a fall in a Minnesota 
hotel room. He was 70. 
</P>
<P>
	Belin, born in the nation's capital, moved to Des Moines in 1954  
and began practicing law. In 1978, he and other lawyers founded the 
firm that would eventually become Belin Lamson McCormick Zumbach 
Flynn, where he served as a senior partner until his death. 
</P>
<P>
	Belin's public service included an appointment to serve as  
counsel to the Warren Commission, which investigated President John 
F. Kennedy's assassination. He wrote two books on the subject, 
including ``Final Disclosure'' in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1991, Belin defended the Warren Commission's work against  
attacks made in the Oliver Stone movie ``JFK.'' Belin called the 
film ``a big lie that would make Adolf Hitler proud.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Belin also served as executive director to the Rockefeller

``Soylent Green,'' ``Scarecrow,'' and the cult horror trilogy 
``Phantasm.''

	NATO Orders Generals To Yugoslavia  
</P>
<P>
	BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) -- NATO ordered its two top generals to  
Belgrade to impress upon Yugoslav authorities the gravity of the 
situation after a massacre of ethnic Albanians in Kosovo. In a 
statement, NATO condemned the killing of 45 people reported 
yesterday and called it a ``flagrant violation of international 
humanitarian law.'' The threat of NATO airstrikes, hanging over the 
heads of Serb authorities since October, remained an option today 
as Serb forces launched a new attack on the ethnic Albanian village 
of Racak, where the massacre took place. Reports were emerging of 
attacks on other nearby communities.

Tribesmen, who control large parts of Yemen, frequently kidnap 
foreigners to gain economic concessions from their government. The

<HEADLINE> Latin Kings Leader Pleads Guilty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A gang leader who sought to recast the notorious  
Latin Kings as community activists pleaded guilty Friday to selling 
cocaine and heroin. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of a deal with federal prosecutors in Brooklyn, Antonio  
Fernandez -- known as King Tone -- will serve at least 12 1/2 years in 
prison. He had faced up to 40 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Gang members who had packed the courtroom flashed the gang hand  
signal -- thumb, forefinger and pinkie pointed upward -- and shouted 
``El rey'' -- ``The king'' -- as Fernandez was led away. 
</P>
<P>
	Before the plea, Fernandez, 32, had officially stepped down as  
leader of the New York chapter of the Almighty Latin King and Queen 
Nation, said his attorney, Ron Kuby. Fernandez had been sincere in 
his campaign to reform the 2,400-member chapter, Kuby added. 
</P>
<P>
	``He tried very hard to get the Latin Kings off the street,''  
Kuby said. ``Unfortunately, he succumbed to those streets.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A high school dropout, convicted drug dealer and father of two  
daughters, Fernandez became the leader of the New York Latin Kings 
in 1996 after his predecessor, Luis ``King Blood'' Felipe, received 
a life sentence in a racketeering case. 
</P>
<P>
	The media-savvy Fernandez soon set about remaking the image of a  
gang known mainly for using deadly force to enforce internal codes 
and protect turf. 
</P>
<P>
	The new Latin Kings organized rallies against police brutality,  
attended community board meetings and campaigned for better public 
housing. Fernandez appeared on ABC's ``Nightline'' and radio talk 
shows. He spoke of banishing drug dealers from the gang, and of 
``knocking down the wall of City Hall by learning the right trigger 
to pull -- the voting trigger.''

	STEAMBOAT SPRINGS, Colo. (AP) -- Belarussian Dmitri Dashinski  
overcame tricky winds Sunday to win the first World Cup aerials 
contest of his career. 
</P>
<P>
	Jacqui Cooper of Australia, the current world champion, won her  
second in a row for the women. 
</P>
<P>
	High winds delayed the start of the final day of the Sprint  
Shootout more than two hours. The final jumpers competed as dusk 
approached at Steamboat Ski Resort. 
</P>
<P>
	Dashinski, whose best previous finish in three years on the  
World Cup tour was third two years ago at Breckenridge, Colo., 
received 237.08 points from the judges for his two jumps. 
</P>
<P>
	Canadian Nicolas Fontaine, the two-time World Cup champion who  
won last week, was runner-up (234.16). 
</P>
<P>
	``I normally don't start so fast but I'm on a bit of a roll for  
these first two contests,'' Fontaine said. ``I want to keep it 
going next week at Lake Tahoe because my goal this season is to win 
the overall Grand Prix and now two podiums give me a good start.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Olympic champion Eric Bergoust of Missoula, Mont., finished  
third with 230.55. 
</P>
<P>
	``I got a little too high on my second jump,'' Bergoust said.  
``We got used to a head wind in practice and then it stopped (for 
the competition) and that messes with your confidence a lot. 
</P>
<P>
	In the women's contest, Cooper won received 186.36 points and  
Canadian Veronica Brenner was second with 177.06. Norway's Hilde 
Lid completed the podium, receiving 170.54. 
</P>
<P>
	Olympic and World Cup champion Nikki Stone of Westborough,  
Mass., was fourth after spending a mostly sleepless night with 
stomach problems. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't know whether I'd be able to jump, but I felt OK this  
morning,'' Stone said. ``I was just weak, so I'm pleased just to be 
able to compete and finish as high as fourth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Liselotte Johansson of Sweden suffered knee injuries when she  
crashed in pre-competition training. She was taken to a local 
clinic and doctors said she probably would not need surgery.
