<HEADLINE> Kuwait not Support Military Attack on Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, November 16 (Xinhua) -- Kuwaiti Foreign Minister Sheikh
Sabah Al-Ahmad Al-Jaber Al-Sabah said here today that Kuwait does
not support military actions against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
"We do not support any military measures against Iraq," said
Sabah following a meeting with the Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak this morning.
</P>
<P>
But he urged Baghdad to fully comply with the United Nations
Security Council resolutions to avoid military strike.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, he denied that the four-way military maneuvers
simultaneously held in Kuwait is directed against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
"I am sorry that their timing came in such circumstances. But
the exercises have no relation whatsoever with the Iraqi crisis,"
</P>
<P>
He said that the joint war games between Kuwait, the United
States, Britain and Italy had been scheduled two months ago to
follow the maneuvers in Egypt in October.
</P>
<P>
Iraq last Thursday expelled six Americans working for the
United Nations Special Commission for eliminating Iraq's weapons
of mass destruction. And the U.S. and Britain is sending the
aircraft carriers of "George Washington" and "Invincible" to the
Gulf to join the USS Nimitz already there.
</P>
<P>
Sabah also denied that the U.S. has asked to use Kuwaiti
facilities in the event of military strikes against Iraq which
invaded Kuwait in 1990.
</P>
<P>
Iraq had urged Arab countries, particularly Gulf countries, not
to let the U.S. use their military bases to launch strikes against
Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
Sabah, also Kuwaiti First Deputy Prime Minister, arrived Egypt
Saturday for a two-day visit. He will later travel to Syria and
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
During his stay here, he delivered a message from Kuwaiti Emir
Sheikh Jaber al-Ahmed Al-Sabah covering bilateral ties and the
latest developments of the regional situations.

<HEADLINE> World Tennis Rankings System To Be Changed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, November 16 (Xinhua) -- The rankings system in men's
tennis will be changed from the year 2,000 to an annual points
race with every player starting at zero in January, a top ATP Tour
official said on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Mark Miles, chief executive officer of the ATP Tour ruling the
men's circuit, said in Hanover that the new system, signalling the
end of the complicated current method under which the players
carry their points from one year to the next, was one of several
changes.
</P>
<P>
In a news conference during the ATP Tour world championship in
Hanover, Miles said a new super league of seven events would be
launched and the year-end championships would be reshaped.
</P>
<P>
All the changes would be introduced from the year 2,000, he
addded.
</P>
<P>
Discussions are under way with the International Tennis
Federation (ITF) and the Women's Tennis Association (WTA) over the
changes and the possibility of including the women in the super
league tournaments and the season-ending event, Miles continuted.
</P>
<P>
The seven events in the super league will be Indian Wells, Key
Biscayne, the Stuttgart and Paris indoor tournaments, two European
clay events and one North American hardcourt event to be
designated, he said.
</P>
<P>
The rankings will take into account the four grand slams, the
super seven and seven other tournaments of lesser importance,
Miles added.
</P>
<P>
The fact that the players will start every year with zero
points instead of having to defend the points they won the
previous year should make the sport more interesting to follow, he
said.
</P>
<P>
The world championship will stay in Hanover and stick to its
current format until 1999.

<HEADLINE> SKorean Automakers to Visit U.S. on Trade Dispute </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, November 16 (Xinhua) -- South Korea Automobile
Manufacturers Association (KAMA) has decided to send a delegation
to work on resolving a trade dispute with the United States.
</P>
<P>
The group, to be led by Chung Mong-gyu, chairman of the KAMA
and Hyundai Motor Co., will be on its way to Washington on Monday,
an official with the industrial association said today.
</P>
<P>
Once there, the South Koreans plan to meet representatives of
the U.S. car industry and officials from the U.S. Department of
Commerce and U.S. Trade Representatives (USTR).
</P>
<P>
They will explain the situation of the South Korean automobile
market while backing their government's measures for a gradual
opening of the market, the KAMA official said.
</P>
<P>
The KAMA is planning a liaison office in the U.S. capital city
to better cooperate with the U.S. auto industry and communicate
with U.S. politicians and industrialists.
</P>
<P>
Early last month, Washington threatened to impose the so-called
Super 301 section of the U.S. trade law against alleged South
Korean restrictions on foreign cars.
</P>
<P>
The USTR said South Korea had not relaxed restrictions on
foreign entry into its auto market.
</P>
<P>
The South Korean government reacted by declaring that it would
bring the case to the World Trade Organization (WTO) for review.
</P>
<P>
The South Korean auto industry was concerned that the dispute
could lead to a significant drop in its car exports to the United
States, which stood at about 200,000 last year.

<HEADLINE> Yemeni PM Leaves for Paris </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANAA, November 16 (Xinhua) -- Yemeni Prime Minister Farag
Saeed Bin Ghanim left here today for Paris to participate in a
Paris Club meeting scheduled for November 18 in a bid to deal with
Yemeni debts owed to Russia.
</P>
<P>
Before leaving Sanaa, the Yemeni prime minister told Saba News
Agency of Yemen that his visit to France is intended to get a
large part of these debts written off and the rest of them
rescheduled, in accordance with the resolutions passed at the
Paris Club meeting held in the Italian city of Naples.
</P>
<P>
Ghanem said that the Yemeni government is optimistic a
breakthrough in this issue could be achieved because of the
remarkable success in Yemen's economic reform programs, the
growing confidence of the international community in the Yemeni
economy and financial support given by donor states and
international organizations to Yemen.
</P>
<P>
He added that his visit to Paris will be a good opportunity for
him to hold talks with a number of French officials and economists
on ways of promoting bilateral cooperation between the two
countries, especially in the economic domain.
</P>
<P>
Yemen hoped to be exempted from 90 percent of the its
6.7-billion-U.S. dollar debts owed to Russia, and that the rest of
these debts would be rescheduled, expecting Yemen's remaining
debts to range between 350 million and 370 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Most of the debts owed by Yemen to Russia date back to the
1980s when the southern part of Yemen got large quantities of arms
from Russia during the civil war.

<HEADLINE> Chirac, Jospin Express Condolences on Marchais' Death </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, November 16 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac
and Prime Minister Lionel Jospin have expressed condolences over
the death of Georges Marchais, the former French Communist Party
(PCF) leader who died of heart disease this morning in Paris.
</P>
<P>
"I learned with sadness the disappearance of Georges Marchais.
I knew him well, and I could have measured the strength and
sincerity of his convictions," said Chirac in a written message of
condolences, in which the president called Marchais "a real figure
who is gone."
</P>
<P>
Chirac said Marchais had "marked profoundly and for long years
the history of the French Communist Party as well as the whole of
our political scenery."
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Jospin said that Marchais was "a man of the
people who become one of the strongest, highest in color and most

"Georges Marchais will remain as a vigorous figure of the
communist movement in the heart of the left of these last
decades," said Jospin in a communique.
</P>
<P>
The French Communist Party is flying the national flag of
France and the red flag at half mast today at its headquarters in

<HEADLINE> Agency: U.S. Gas Emissions Will Be Worse Than Thought </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 16 (Xinhua) -- The emissions of carbon
dioxide and other heat-trapping gases from energy use will grow
faster than expected in the United States in the next few years,
the U.S. Energy Department said.
</P>
<P>
This would make it more difficult for the United States to live
up to President Clinton's proposal to cap emissions of these gases
at 1990 levels over the next 10 to 15 years, the Washington Post
pointed out in a report of the annual energy outlook by the Energy
Information Administration today.
</P>
<P>
The nation's economic growth would be slightly higher than
previously estimated, electricity would be cheaper and fuel prices
would not change, the agency said.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, more oil will be used because of an increase of more
cars with more horsepowers, and more people travelling by plane.
</P>
<P>
These factors are likely to increase emissions of greenhouse
gases, produced largely through the use of fossil fuels like oil
and coal.
</P>
<P>
Carbon emissions in 1990 were 1,336 million metric tons, the
agency said. If no action was taken, the number would climb to
1,722 million by 2010.
</P>
<P>
Jay E. Hakes, head of the Energy Information Administration was
quoted by the Post as saying that there were technologies to
reduce carbon output, but no new inventions or improvements
of existing devices appeared likely to be in wide enough use by
2010 to drop the forecast much.

<P>
BEIJING, November 16 (Xinhua) -- League leader Dalian Wanda,
with 11 wins and three draws, came from behind to keep its
unbeaten record intact as China resumed its first division soccer
after the internationals returned to club duties from their
unsuccessful World Cup try.
</P>
<P>
Hao Haidong, top striker in the Chinese team, scored twice to
help the home team Wamda see off the visiting Tianjin Samsung 3-1,
who surprisingly took a 1-0 lead in the 60th minute.
</P>
<P>
The victory in Dalian, host site for the Chinese World Cup
campaign, just brought a little consolation to the home crowd, who
suffered a heartbreaking blow as they witnessed their national
team fail to qualify for the World Cup for the fifth time at as
many attempts in history.
</P>
<P>
Last year's runners-up Shanghai Shenhua kept moving up on the
table to the fourth place after a rain-soaked 2-0 win over the
bottom club Guangdong Hongyuan.
</P>
<P>
Guangzhou Apollo striked a season-high three goals in one game,
beating August First at home. It only managed four goals in the
previous 13 matches.
</P>
<P>
Yanbian Aodong remianed its unbeaten streak this season to 10
matches when the home team took full advantage of the below-zero
cold conditions to win 1-0 over the Southwest China club Sichuang
Quanxing.
</P>
<P>
In day's other matches, Jinan Taishan was forced to a home
goaless draw with Beijing Guo'an on a snow-white ground; Qingdao
Hainiu came from one goal behind to tie Vanguards Huandao 1-1
away.

<HEADLINE> UK PM Admits Mishandling Formula One Row </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 16 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony
Blair said today he accepts that the government mishandled the row
over the Formula One (F1) tobacco sponsorship.
</P>
<P>
He said in a BBC Television interview, "I take full
responsibility and apologize for that." He also conceded that the
matter "hasn't been handled well."
</P>
<P>
The Labor government announced on November 5 that it would
exempt Formula One motor racing from a ban on tobacco sponsorship.
</P>
<P>
The government's trouble began following the revelation that
the Labor Party had received a donation of 1 million pounds (1.7
million US dollars) from F1 boss Bernie Ecclestone before the
general election on May 1 and that it had offered the party more
money after the election.
</P>
<P>
Blair said today that the government should have admitted that
it had received the donation more than a week ago rather than
allow information to drip out by damaging leaks.
</P>
<P>
"It should not have come out in drips and drabs and we should
have focused on this earlier," the prime minister said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he pledged that the harsh lessons of the episode had
been learnt and stressed his government's commitment to higher
ethical standards.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that the F1 row had been the government's worst
since the general election and it could herald the end of the
Labor government's six-month political honeymoon with the
country's voters.

BELGRADE, November 16 (Xinhua) -- President of the Federal
Republic of Yugoslavia Slobodan Milosevic today hailed his China
tour as a great success that marks the start of comprehensive
cooperation between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Milosevic said this on arriving here from his three-day state
visit to China, where he held talks with Chinese leaders and
toured Shanghai, China's largest industrial center.
</P>
<P>
The president, who arrived in Beijing on November 13, said he
is confident that the cooperation, highly important for both
sides, would be further promoted.
</P>
<P>
"China is not only the most populous country in the world, but
also the most successful one judging from many parameters, because
it has achieved an unprecedented economic growth rate in the world
over the past dozen years," he said.
</P>
<P>
It has also made rapid progress in many sectors including high
technologies and telecommunications, he added.
</P>
<P>
The joint statement on cooperation and other important
documents signed by the two sides during his stay in China reflect
their common policies on cooperation and will serve as a basis for
further strengthening the cooperative ties, he noted.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Vice FM on Li Peng's Visit to Japan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 16 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-Foreign Minister
Tang Jiaxuan today said Premier Li Peng's visit to Japan is very
successful and gained important results.
</P>
<P>
Tang, who was with the Chinese premier during the six-day
official good-will visit, made the remark on Li's flight home.
</P>
<P>
The trip, he said, took place on the occasion of the 25th
anniversary of the normalization of the Sino-Japanese diplomatic
ties, and therefore was given high attention by the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The world community was also attentive to the event, he said.
</P>
<P>
During Li's visit, China and Japan reaffirmed their goal of
striving to build good-neighborly cooperative relations oriented
toward the 21th century, the senior Chinese diplomat said.
</P>
<P>
On his part, the Chinese premier put forth five principles as a
guidepost for further expanding the China-Japan ties, and they
were well received by Japanese from all walks of life, Tang said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, he noted, the two sides reached the consensus that
frequent visits, contacts and dialogues between the two countries'
leaders will be conducive to better mutual understanding and trust.
</P>
<P>
On Japan's part, the government invited Chinese President Jiang
Zemin to visit the country next year on the 20th anniversary of
the signing of the China-Japan Treaty of Peace and Friendship.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese side has accepted the invitation in principle, the
vice-foreign minister said.
</P>
<P>
Also during Li's visit, China and Japan signed a new fishery
agreement, and reached a cooperation agreement on environmental
protection into the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
And in bilateral talks for China's entry into the World Trade
Organization (WTO), the two countries announced major progresses
in the fields of service and trade, and agreed to work for the
early conclusion of bilateral agreements on those issues, he said.
</P>
<P>
Both sides agreed to further deepen and strengthen economic,
scientific and technological cooperation between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Premier Li toured a number of well-known high-tech Japanese
companies, which expressed their strong willingness to cooperate
with China in high-tech areas, Tang said.
</P>
<P>
During his stay in Japan, the Chinese premier stressed the
importance and the need to enhance the traditional friendly ties
between the two countries, educate young people with correct
historic views and nurture successors for the cause of China-Japan
friendship.
</P>
<P>
These initiatives, Tang said, triggered positive responses from
the Japanese government, its opposition and the general public.
</P>
<P>
As China and Japan are close neighbors and are countries
influential over Asia and the world, he noted, the development of
their good-neighborly friendship and mutually beneficial
cooperation not only benefit the two peoples, but serve the peace
and development across the region and the world.
</P>
<P>
Tang expressed his belief that Li Peng's visit to Japan will
play an important role in promoting the healthy development of
China-Japan ties and in maintaining peace and stability in the
Asia-Pacific region.

<HEADLINE> French Communist Party to Hold Marchais' Funeral Thursday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, November 16 (Xinhua) -- The French Communist Party (PCF)
will hold the funeral of its former leader Georges Marchais
Thursday in Val-de-Marne south of Paris, where he was parliament
deputy from 1973 to 1997, said the PCF press bureau today.
</P>
<P>
Marchais, general secretary of the PCF from 1972 until 1994,
died of heart disease today in hospital in Paris at the age of 77.
</P>
<P>
The PCF National Bureau said the death of Marchais caused pain
and was an immense loss for the party.
</P>
<P>
"It is not time... to evaluate the contribution Georges
(Marchais) had brought to our party and to France. This evaluation
will be done," said the National Bureau in a declaration
transmitted by Agence France-Presse.
</P>
<P>
It said that Marchais "became a communist for doing the good
and for serving the cause of the humble, from whom he came. He had
never departed from this choice," said the declaration.
</P>
<P>
Helene Luc, president of the PCF group in the French Senate,
said that Marchais "marked the history of France for more than a
quarter of the century by assuming major responsibilities in a
period of great upheavals."
</P>
<P>
In Villejuif, a city south of Paris which is administered by
the PCF, many government officials and employees remained in a
state of shock after hearing the unexpected death of Marchais.
</P>
<P>
The French national flag and the red flag were flying at half
mast today at the office building of the local section of the PCF
there, while people gave their signatures at books of condolences
at the City Hall, where Marchais was once the mayor.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Encourages Employee Ownership Scheme </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, November 16 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwe government and
the private sector should come up with employee ownership schemes
in line with world trends of securing equitable distribution of
wealth among the workers, a minister of state has said.
</P>
<P>
Officially closing a two-day employee ownership schemes and
sub-contracting seminar today in Bulawayo, the country's second
largest city, minister of state for parastatals and
indigenisation Cephas Msipa said such schemes would economically
empower the majority of black people, helping the indigenisation
process.
</P>
<P>
"Let's therefore work together with private sector and the
government to ensure that we put in place schemes which are
meaningful both to the workers as direct beneficiaries and to the
general cause of indigenisation," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said previous experiences from developed countries had
shown that employee share ownership impacted positively on labour
relations and productivity, especially where the benefits were
significant because the worker was also an employer.
</P>
<P>
He commended some big private sector companies that were
already implementing or considering employee ownership schemes
while urging those that had not done so to follow suit.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Msipa said the government was finalising mechanisms
to sub-contract some non-core functions and encouraged indigenous
business people to play an active role.
</P>
<P>
He also criticised indigenous business people of sometimes
failing to perform up to standard and implored them to do a
perfect job to avoid a situation where the government would be
forced to protect poor-performers.

<HEADLINE> Demand for Cellular Phone Likely to Drop in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, November 16 (Xinhua) -- The demand for cellular
phones in Tanzania is likely to drop in 1998, when an ambitious
communications rehabilitation program is completed, Observer
reported today.
</P>
<P>
The National Telecommunications Reconstruction Program, due
for completion by December next year, will increase the
distribution of telephones and improve the network performance at
a cheaper price, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
The 400,000 US dollars program, almost 75 percent complete,
involves the installation of ultra modern digital swithches and
superhighways at various points in the country, the construction
of buildings to house telephone equipment and ugrading of
satellites linking Tanzania with outside world.
</P>
<P>
The program is being implemented by Tanzania
Telecommunications Company Limited (TTCL) and seven donors,
including the World Bank, the European Union and the African
Development Bank.
</P>
<P>
It has already availed switching capacities of 62,450 Median
Distribution Framework (MDF) pairs and 61,580 lines so far,
reducing tremendously the number of customers on the waiting
lists in seven towns of the country, according to TTCL Public
Relations Manager, Issa Semtawa.
</P>
<P>
At the end of the entire project, an additional number of
137,758 exchange lines and 192,240 MDF pairs respectively will be
available enabling clients get services as they supply.
</P>
<P>
Telephone density would stand at 1.2 above the target of 1.0
set for the year 2000, he said.

<HEADLINE> Blair Remains Tough on Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 16 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony
Blair today remained tough on Iraq and refused to rule out the use
of force to resolve the crisis over Iraq.
</P>
<P>
"We must reserve the option of force if diplomatic means fail,"
he said today on BBC television.
</P>
<P>
Earlier on Saturday night, Blair had talked with President Bill
Clinton for 15 minutes on the telephone and discussed the United
Nations weapons inspector crisis with Iraq and both agreed to
stand tough together in the crisis.
</P>
<P>
Blair said the Middle East would face a worse situation than
the 1991 Gulf War if Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein developed weapons
of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
He added, "Saddam Hussein should get the message and get it
clear and straight -- these UN resolutions are there to protect
the world. We are not allowing you to develop weapons of mass
destruction."
</P>
<P>
Britain has kept its pressure on Iraq these days by putting
some of its planes on 48-hour alert and sending its aircraft
carrier Invincible to Gibraltar from the Caribbean.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Hopes Iraqi Crisis Contained </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, November 16 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr
Moussa today voiced hope that the current crisis between Iraq and
the United States will be contained through political action.
</P>
<P>
He said at a press conference that Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister
Tariq Aziz is due here Monday to hold talks with Arab League
Secretary General Ahmed Esmat Abdel-Meguid on the regional
tensions.
</P>
<P>
"This will be a chance to discuss with the Iraqi official the
latest developments in the area," said the minister, who will
also meet Aziz.
</P>
<P>
Aziz's visit to Egypt is part of a North African tour, which
also includes Libya, Tunisia, Algeria and Morocco, to explain
Iraq's view on the tensions.
</P>
<P>
It is evident that the Iraqis are frustrated and desperate over
the slow progress in lifting the crippling sanctions imposed on it
by the United Nations Security Council since its invasion of
Kuwait in August 1990, Moussa said.
</P>
<P>
The frustration and hardships of the Iraqi people should be put
into consideration while regarding prospects of cooperation
between the Iraqi government and the U.N. Special Commission
(UNSCOM) for eliminating its weapons of mass destruction, he said.
</P>
<P>
He revealed that Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak has sent two
messages to Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, and held contacts with
U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan to discuss the situations.
</P>
<P>
Iraq, accusing the Americans of controlling the U.N. weapons
inspection teams and prolonging the lifting of the sanctions,
kicked them out last Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The UNSCOM must verify that Iraq has destroyed its weapons of
mass destruction before the U.N. Security Council will decide to
lift the sanctions.
</P>
<P>
In the wake of Iraq's action, the United States and Britain are
sending their aircraft carriers of "George Washington" and
"Invincible" to the Gulf to join the USS Nimitz already there.

<HEADLINE> UNITA Urged to Fulfill Peace Agreement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, November 16 (Xinhua ) -- The Angolan Social Democratic
Party (PSDA) urged the former rebel party here today to cooperate
with government in re-establishing local governments in areas
under its control.
</P>
<P>
Nzuzi Nsumbo, deputy chairman of PSDA, one of the major
parties in the country, made the statement at a ceremony marking
the eighth anniversary of the founding of the party.
</P>
<P>
He demanded UNITA, the National Union for the Total
Independence of Angola, to offer the actual number of army it now
has to the UN supervision team, so to facilitate the disarmament
of UNITA according to the 1994 Lusaka Peace Protocol.
</P>
<P>
Nsumbo said that the scheduled meeting between Angolan
President Eduardo Dos Santos and UNITA Chairman Jonas Savimbi by
the end of the month is crucial to the future of the country.
</P>
<P>
The two sides should narrow down their differences and gain
new impetus to the peace process so as to speed up the peace
process in the country and concentrate Angola's attention on
rebuilding, Nsumbo said.
</P>
<P>
He said that his party believes that the national unity and
reconciliation government, parliament members and UN
representatives in Angola have made great effort to the peace
process in the country, adding that UNITA's refusal to allow
local governments to be re-established in its areas, has
undermined the interests of other parties.
</P>
<P>
PSDA fully supports UN's sanctions over UNITA, which would
press it to fulfill the Lusaka peace agreement, Nsumbo said.
</P>
<P>
He appealed to the government to continue collecting the arms
scattered among the citizens for the security of the country.

<HEADLINE> U.S. State Secretary Arrives in Kuwait </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, November 16 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright arrived in Kuwait within a four-country
Gulf tour aimed at rallying support of Gulf Arab allies for
U.S. military Build-up in the region.
</P>
<P>
Albright arrived here from Manama, Bahrain, after first
attending the inauguration session of the Economic Conference of
the Middle East and North Africa this morning in Doha, Qatar and
she will also go to Saudi Arabia tonight.
</P>
<P>
Upon her arrival here, Albright immediately held talks with
Kuwaiti Amir Sheikh Jaber Al-Ahmad Al-Sabah and Crown Prince
and Prime Minister Sheikh Saad Al-Abdellah Al-Salem Al-Sabah.
</P>
<P>
She is in the region with two preoccupations mainly to
rally support to confront Iraq in a possible military showdown
over the latest crisis resulting from Iraq's expulsion of
American arms inspectors, besides ensuring success of the Doha
economic conference.
</P>
<P>
Washington and Baghdad are locked in a confrontation over
Iraq's expulsion this week of Americans working as part of
the U.N. Special Commission in charge of verifying weapons of
mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
Albright's spokesman James Rubin said in Berne before the
American state secretary setting out for the region that "at a
time like this it is very important for us to consult with our
friends in the Gulf" because those are the "countries that are
the front-line states."
</P>
<P>
Albright said that she started this shuttle tour of this
region because "we have a mutual interests in the stability
of the region."
</P>
<P>
Albright made it clear in Doha that Washington was
determined that Iraq not be allowed to block the U.N. mission
although her country was making every effort to end the
crisis through diplomatic channels.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton Friday ordered the aircraft George
Washington to rush to the Gulf region to join another carrier
battle group consisted of Nimitz aircraft carrier and several
other warships that are already on station.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Central Command chief Anthony Zinni visited Kuwait
Friday to hold discussions of contingency plans which Albright
might now ask for permission to activate, diplomats here said.
</P>
<P>
However, observers here believe that it would be much more
difficult for the United States to build a coalition both inside
and outside the region to support a military action against Iraq
comparing with the Gulf War in 1991 when an allied force led by
the U.S. liberated Kuwait from Iraqi seven-month occupation.
</P>
<P>
They said if Clinton orders a punitive military strike, he
risks splitting the already shaky international coalition that
has kept Saddam Hussein more or less in check since the
Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
Russia, France and many Arab countries including regional
heavyweight Egypt are against military action against Iraq.

<HEADLINE> Israeli, US Defense Ministers on Hot Line Over Iraqi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 16 (Xinhua) -- As standoff between Iraq
and the United States continues growing, Israeli Defense Minister
Yitzhak Mordechai has a discussion with his U.S. counterpart
William Cohen over hot line on the crisis.
</P>
<P>
Mordechai discussed with Cohen a variety of issues, prominently
the current Iraqi crisis, Israeli state television Channel I
reported today. This was the first time that Mordechai used the
hot line since it was installed 10 months ago.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Army has been closely monitoring the ongoing showdown
between Iraq and the U.S. over the weapon inspection, but it
believed that the possibility of an Iraqi missile strike against
Israel is little in case an Iraqi-U.S. military confrontation
breaks out.
</P>
<P>
Last week, Mordechai called on the public not to be panic
about the current crisis in the Gulf, citing the situation was
different from 7 years ago.
</P>
<P>
Israeli military officials noted that while Iraq has only left
a small number of missile launchers as the result of the weapon
inspection conducted by the United Nations, Israel has also
acquired more advanced anti-missile systems.
</P>
<P>
Military analysts were quoted by Israel Radio as saying that
even a military conflict breaks out in the Gulf, the American
strike is expected to be limited and so would be the Iraqi
response, which means Israel is unlikely to be attacked.
</P>
<P>
However, Israeli Army and citizens do not risk taking any
chance as their memory is still alive about the missile attacks
launched against Tel Aviv by Iraq in the 1991 Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Army's Home Command, which is in charge of civil
defense, has issued notifications to citizens to remind them of
updating their masks and getting new ones for new babies.
</P>
<P>
Mask distribution centers across the country have been busy in
dealing with an increased number of anxious citizens who either
come to replace the old masks or to get new ones for babies.
</P>
<P>
In Jerusalem's Mask Distribution Center, a long queue was formed
this afternoon. Those waiting to get masks said they were convinced
to come by the hectic media report about the crisis although they
have been notified by the Army.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Intransigence Obstructs Regional Economic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DOHA, November 16 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian Deputy Prime Minister
for Development Jawad Anani said here today that Israeli
government's intransigence is obstructing the economic development
process in the Middle East and North Africa.
</P>
<P>
The Jordanian official made the remarks when addressing today's
inaugural session of the fourth Middle East and North Africa
Economic Conference here.
</P>
<P>
The setback of negotiations along the Palestinian track, the
delay in redeployment of Israeli troops, the continuing
construction of settlements in Arab land, the denial of legitimate
rights of the Arab inhabitants in Jerusalem and other acts have
turned the economic dream into a mirage of skepticism and doubts,
said Anani.
</P>
<P>
Anani, who is leading Jordan's delegation to the Doha economic
conference, added that the Middle East and North African countries
have not succeeded so far in creating an economic zone due to
continuing tensions in the region.
</P>
<P>
He indicated that the various aspects of tension and long years
of warfare have driven away investments, technology and long-term
projects.
</P>
<P>
Anani denounced Israel's hegemony and tight control over
Palestinian economy, asserting that liberating and freeing
Palestinian economy, and unleashing its potential, has become
preconditions of opening up channels of cooperation based on
equality and mutual benefits.
</P>
<P>
The Middle East and North Africa, as a region, standing at the
threshold of the 21st century, finds itself incapable of exerting
the required energy to catch up with international economy and
other economic groupings, he said.
</P>
<P>
He called upon the countries of the region to exert much
greater efforts than ever before, to narrow the gap with world
development rates.
</P>
<P>
Anani emphasized that without cooperation, the countries of the
region will not solve their basic problems, namely, the problem of
water, food production, creation of job opportunities, raising
people's standards of education and health, build-up of
competitive production capabilities, and providing the appropriate
atmosphere for creativity in administering civilian and military
resources.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he reiterated his country's appreciation of the Arab
League initiative for the establishment of an Arab free trade zone.
</P>
<P>
Before the inauguration session of the conference, Jordan
signed here today a U.S.-backed agreement with Israel for the
establishment of a distinct industrial zone on the territory of
Jordan.

current Middle East and North Africa Economic Conference will not
harm inter-GCC relations.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to newsmen after the inaugural session of the Doha
conference here today, Hajilan said the conference would not
affect the friendly and close relations between Qatar and other
GCC member states.
</P>
<P>
He attributed the absence of some GCC states from the

concluded agreements".

He regretted that Israeli officials did not wish to return to
the true peace track.
</P>

He pointed out that many of those who truly wished from the
very outset to use such conferences as a means to activate the
peace process had been disappointed, adding that "this had
prompted some GCC states to absent themselves from the
conference."

<P>
About a dozen of Arab countries, including Egypt, Syria,
Lebanon, Libya, Algeria, Morocco, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab
Emirates and Bahrain boycotted the Doha economic conference in

</P>
<P>
He was expected to discuss with Saudi leaders ways of boosting

<HEADLINE> ECOMOG Jet Fighter Reappears over Freetown </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOGOS, November 16 (Xinhua) -- A Jet fighter of the West
African Peacekeeping Force (ecomog) returned to Sierra Leone
today, leading to sporadic firing in the capital Freetown.
</P>
<P>
An ECOMOG Alpha fighter plane flew over Freetown at around
1:00 this afternoon and at about the same time anti-aircraft
firing was heard from the ground.
</P>
<P>
The jet fighter then disappeared without returning fire, the
British Broadcasting Corporation reported.
</P>
<P>
Before 2:30 pm, the national radio announced that just a few
seconds ago, the ECOMOG aircraft fired several times at the house
of a former minister in one suburban town of Freetown, but no
casualty was reported.
</P>
<P>
Some people reportedly said the ECOMOG plane did open fire at
their houses, while some others said they were not too sure where
the gunfire came from, suggesting it may be from the forces of
the military junta from the ground.
</P>
<P>
At another town where ECOMOG jet fighter flew over, people
were angry, saying that it violated the peace accord signed last
month in Conakry, Guinea.
</P>
<P>
The peace accord between west African foreign ministers and
the junta calls for ceasefire between the junta forces and ECOMOG
which has been deployed in Sierra Leone to enforce a sub-regional
and United Nations sanction since coupists overthrew the
legitimate government in may this year.
</P>
<P>
This is the first that ECOMOG fighter plane was reported to
return to Freetown and open fire since the fruitless talks
between the peacekeepers and the junta ended last Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The two-day talks was designed to work out modalities to
implement the Conakry Peace Agreement.
</P>
<P>
The two parties differed over a number of major issues
including whether the Sierra Leonean army should be disarmed.

unemployment rate rose to 2.3 percent in Hong Kong in the
August-October period, according to an official report here today.
</P>
<P>
The figure rose from the July-September period when the
unemployment rate stood at 2.2 percent, the lowest in six years,
the Census and Statistics Department of the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (SAR) said.
</P>
<P>
It said that the increase occurred mainly in the construction,
manufacturing and transport sectors, while the situation in other
major sectors was stable.
</P>
<P>
The statistics were obtained from a continuous General
Household Survey. In the survey, the definitions used in measuring
unemployment follow closely those recommended by the International
Labor Organization.
</P>
<P>
Being "seasonally adjusted" refers to the fact that
unemployment rate has been adjusted for seasonal variations in the
proportion of first-time job-seekers in the labor force.
</P>
<P>
Also today, a SAR government spokesman said that growth in
total employment in the third quarter continued to outpace that in
labor supply.
</P>
<P>
In the three months ending September 1997, total employment
showed a notable increase of 4.3 percent over a year earlier,
while total labor supply grew by 3.8 percent, he noted.

<HEADLINE> Japan's Big Commercial Bank Declares Bankruptcy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, November 17 (Xinhua) -- Japan's Takushoku Bank in
Hokkaido declared bankruptcy today because of massive
non-performing loans.
</P>
<P>
This is the first national commercial bank to go bankrupt in
the country.
</P>
<P>
One of Japan's top 10 commercial banks, it will have to
transfer its business in Hokkaido to the North Pacific Bank,
reports here said. But they did not say if it has found banks to
take over its business in other areas.
</P>
<P>
Finance Minister Hiroshi Mitsuzuka and Bank of Japan Governor
Yasuo Matsushita said all deposits at Hokkaido Takushoku will
be protected.
</P>
<P>
The central bank will extend special loans without collateral
to Hokkaido Takusyoku until it shuts down its operations, they
said.
</P>
<P>
Sadamasa Kawatani, president of the Hokkaido Takushoku, told a
press conference in Sapporo that his bank has faced difficulties
in procuring funds due to its bad loans, loss of creditability and
the fall in share prices.
</P>
<P>
The amount of disclosed bad loans held by Hokkaido Takushoku
Bank was 930 billion yen (7.4 billion U.S. dollars) as of March 31
this year, the end of fiscal 1996.
</P>
<P>
In April, Hokkaido Takushoku announced plans to merge with the
regional Hokkaido Bank for survival. But the latter suspected that
the former's nonperforming loans were far larger than it had
admitted.
</P>
<P>
In October, the two banks announced they postponed the merger
plans.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here viewed this bankruptcy as symbolizing the
collapse of the Finance Ministry's so-called convoy system, which
protects weaker financial institutions with a web of
administrative regulations and guidance.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 17 (Xinhua) -- Vice-Premier Jiang Chunyun,
who also serves as director of the State Flood Control and Drought
Relief Headquarters, has called on governments at all levels to
reinforce flood control and drought relief capabilities in order
to guarantee a bumper harvest in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Severe summer droughts hit provinces north of the Yangtze River,
with southern regions in China suffering from flooding resulting
from a string of typhoons. Nonetheless, the country recorded a
good grain harvest due to the disaster preparedness campaign which
effectively helped to control droughts and flooding, according to
Jiang.
</P>
<P>
Despite notable progress in overall drought and flood control,
the nation's disaster preparedness system has suffered from
prominent bottlenecks caused by obsolete water conservancy
facilities, inadequate irrigation systems and low-level technology
for flood control.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said the central government will improve the
technological level of disaster preparedness facilities, devise a
drought relief and flood control program for the next century, and
increase inputs to water conservation and irrigation projects.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the drought in north China led to a decline in
the autumn grain harvest, and a 30 percent decline in water
reserves in the nation's reservoirs.
</P>
<P>
He called on local governments to remain on alert and increase
the labor force involved in the anti-drought campaign.

SEOUL, November 17 (Xinhua) -- The battered South Korean won
dropped to an all-time low of 1,008.60 against the U.S. dollar on
Monday after the central bank withdrew from the market.
</P>
<P>
After opening at 986.00, the won slid 2.25 percent down from
the previous day's close to 1,008.60, its daily allowable low,
</P>
<P>
Surprised dealers said that the Bank of Korea (BOK) abruptly
stepped out of the market, giving up support to the local currency
and led the dropping past the 1,000 level for the first time.
</P>
<P>
BOK officials said that today's retreat does not mean the
central bank has completely abandoned its intervention policy.
"The bank will step in at any time judged necessary in the
future," they said.
</P>
<P>
Up to this morning, the central bank said it was certain the
won would gradually become firmer against the dollar, reaching 970
by the end of this week.
</P>
<P>
A market analyst here interpreted the central bank's move as
being influenced by growing concerns over the nation's declining
foreign-exchange reserve level.
</P>
<P>
The crash was caused by the soaring U.S. dollar and the dim
prospects for the passage of the government's monetary reform
bills through the current National Assembly session, stock traders
said.

economic ties with markets in the Far East, especially with
China.
</P>
<P>
Kwasniewski made the remarks during a meeting with a group of
over 100 Chinese and Polish entrepreneurs attending today's
economic and trade forum.
</P>
<P>
"My visit to China and this forum prove the point," said

</P>
<P>
Kwasniewski briefed participants on his country's reform and
economic development in recent years, and pointed to the broad

He touched on bilateral trade contacts and noted that Poland's
imports from China have increased for several years running, while
the volume of exports to China has remained relatively low. He
said the two sides should explore new trade channels in order to

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, November 17 (Xinhua) -- A senior solicitor stressed
here today that the Patents Ordinance and Registered Designs
Ordinance, which came into force on the eve of Hong Kong's return
to China, marked an important step in its efforts to protect
intellectual property rights (IPR).
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a seminar attended by over 130 lawyers and
practitioners of designs and patents, Senior Solicitor of the
Intellectual Property Department Fanny Pang said the two laws
provide the establishment of IPR regimes in the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (SAR) for the protection of industrial
designs and inventions in line with international standards.
</P>
<P>
The seminar was organized by the Intellectual Property
Department of the SAR government to brief the experts on the two
ordinances and associated registration procedures.
</P>
<P>
"The Patents Ordinance provides for the grant of independent,
standard patents valid for 20 years in Hong Kong," she said.
</P>
<P>
The ordinance also provides for the grant of short-term patents
for a period of eight years. "This form of patent suits inventions
with a short commercial life," Pang pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Touching upon the registered design, she said: "Under the
Registered Designs Ordinance, design which appeals to the eye and
is applied to an article by means of an industrial process will be
eligible for registration subject to formality examination."
</P>
<P>
The period of protection of a registered design will initially
be five years, she said. "It may be extended for four periods of
five years each upon payment of the prescribed renewal fee. The
maximum duration of protection will be a total of 25 years."
</P>
<P>
At the one-day seminar, officials from the Intellectual
Property Department also explained in detail the procedures for
the new patents system and registered design registration system.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Heads List of Corruption in Africa, Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, November 17 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's High Court Judge
Justice Smith today underscored the need to deal with corruption,
saying Zimbabwe is rapidly climbing the ladder of leading corrupt
African countries.
</P>
<P>
"Zimbabwe is heading the list of corruption in Africa and
something has to be done to stop the rot," said Justice Smith at
a three-day Transparency International workshop on national
integrity against corruption in Harare.
</P>
<P>
Smith, who officially opened the workshop, implored
participants to come up with a "concrete" action plan on how to
tackle corruption.
</P>
<P>
By coming up with an action plan, the workshop would have made
a giant step towards developing a national integrity or code of
ethics aimed at curbing corruption, Smith said.
</P>
<P>
Financed by the European Union, the workshop plans to prepare

<HEADLINE> Asian Currency Turmoil to Slow Down Global Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, November 17 (Xinhua) -- The Asian currency turmoil
will slow down the rest of the world's economy in 1998, an
economist predicted here today.
</P>
<P>
Bruce Steinberg, chief economist of Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co, said:
"All of the events in this part of the world are sending out a
very powerful contractual impulse into the world's economy."
</P>
<P>
In a special presentation on the financial turmoil in Asia,
Steinberg predicted slower growth, slower corporate earnings,
lower interest rate and less inflation in all economic regions in
the world.
</P>
<P>
Economic growth will slow down sharply in Asia, the center of
the financial storm, said the American economist.
</P>
<P>
"Latin America has already caught the Asian flu," he said. As a
direct result of the impact of the Asian crisis, Brazil, which he
had predicted would grow by four percent a month ago, now will not
grow at all in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Growth will also be slower in the United States and Europe.
Steinberg estimated that the currency turbulence in Asia will
reduce the U.S. economic growth by half percent next year. "The
downside risk is so significant, and if anything happens, the U.S.
growth will slow even more than the predicted 2.5 percent," he
added.
</P>
<P>
Corporate earnings will be lower but still positive in the
U.S., he predicted. "The U.S. economy is going to end up in pretty
good shape despite what happened here."

<HEADLINE> Russia Coach Blamed For World Cup Failure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, November 17 (Xinhua) -- Russia coach Boris Ignatyev
laid himself open to the criticism from Russia's top football
officials and media on Monday for his country's failure to qualify
for the World Cup finals in France.
</P>
<P>
Russia Football Union chief Vyacheslav Koloskov scolded
Ignatyev for his indecision in working out the best line-up,
lamenting that Russia should have avoided the play-off with Italy
and qualify automatically from its original group, one of the
weakest in the European zone.
</P>
<P>
Russia media were equally scathing, saying that the Russia
coach had committed tactical failings.
</P>
<P>
It is the first time in 20 years that Russia or the Soviet
Union have failed to qualify for the World Cup finals after Russia
lost 2-1 overall to Italy in their play-off.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, November 17 (Xinhua) -- Chief Executive of the Hong
Kong Special Administrative Region Tung Chee Hwa has appointed
Marvin Cheung Kin-tung as chairman of the newly-established Estate
Agents Authority (EAA) and Moses Cheng Mo-chi as his deputy, a
senior official said today.
</P>
<P>
Tung also named 18 ordinary members of the EAA, which was set
up in late October amid the ups and downs in the local stock
market. Its main functions were "to regulate the conduct of estate
agents and to devise a licensing system for estate agents."
</P>
<P>
While making efforts to stabilize the share market, the
government of the Special Administrative Region (SAR) has paid
more attention to the housing prices and estate problems.
</P>
<P>
The appointments were announced earlier today by Secretary for
Housing Dominic Wong, who said that the newly-appointed officials
would serve for a period of two years with effect from November 1.
</P>
<P>
The EAA has a wide participation of people from different
spheres of life, including estate agents, property developers,
legal professionals, a surveyor, consumer affairs personnel, an
accountant, a public affairs consultant, businessmen, provisional
legislators and government officials "responsible for overseeing
estate agency development and regulation," Wong said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed, "The EAA will therefore have a good balance of
different interests."
</P>
<P>
According to him, the newly-formed body will hold its first
meeting very soon and "it will take about a year for the EAA to
devise the necessary regulations, rules and guidelines under the
Estate Agents Ordinance."

<P>
STOCKHOLM, November 17 (Xinhua) -- Some big Swedish businesses
are prepared to use the euro in their transactions with the
clients in the countries of the European economic and monetary
union (EMU) although Stockholm has decided not to join the single
currency in 1999.
</P>
<P>
Nearly half of the 21 big businesses surveyed by the newspaper
Today's Business have decided to partially or totally use the euro
for price quotations and account settlements when the new currency
is to be launched on January 1, 1999.
</P>
<P>
They include such big names as the Swiss-Swedish engineering
group ABB, telecommunications giant Ericsson, ball bearings
manufacturer SKF, automobile group Volvo and forestry group Stora.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for SKF said his company will settle accounts in
the euro as required by its clients in EMU countries.
</P>
<P>
A monetary policy official with Stora said his company "regards
the use of the euro as a chance to create a common financial
language".
</P>
<P>
Ericsson will reportedly use a dual monetary system to settle
its year-end accounts in 1999: the euro for the general statement
and the Swedish krona for the detailed reports.

<P>
In his opening address, Nepal's Central Bank Governor Satyendra

<HEADLINE> China Places Priority on Automobile Safety </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 17 (Xinhua) -- A senior government official
in charge of China's automotive industry says that China places
high priority on the introduction and development of automotive
safety.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the government is extending great efforts to
reduce traffic accidents.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Xiaoyu, director of the Automotive Department under the
Ministry of Machinery(MOM), made the remarks at today's Automotive
Safety Technology Seminar jointly sponsored by Sweden-based Volvo
and the China Machinery Consultants International.
</P>
<P>
The safety issue has prevailed since the introduction of
China's automotive industry some 110 years ago, according to Zhang.
</P>
<P>
Domestic automobile manufacturers have lagged behind in
introducing safety technology, said Zhang, adding that China
nonetheless introduced 25 compulsory rules governing operations of
the industry.
</P>
<P>
China has also established three test centers to ensure the
safety of domestically-produced vehicles, according to Zhang.
</P>
<P>
The director called for expanded international cooperation in
the sector in order to help China's automotive industry adopt
international practices at the earliest possible date.
</P>
<P>
Statistics for 1992 show that China had 22.8 million motor
vehicles, with the highway death toll standing at 58,700
people. The number of related injuries stood at 114,000 people,
with economic losses for the year ending at 640 million
yuan. Respective figures for 1996 jumped to 28.8 million, 73,700,
174,000, and 1.72 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Experts attending the seminar joined in in-depth discussions on
the development of automobile safety. Bjorn Lundell, a senior
design Engineer for Volvo, briefed participants on the Swedish
company's experience in the field.
</P>
<P>
Lars-Ake Skager, deputy mayor of Gothenburg, Germany, the Volvo
headquarters, briefed participants on cooperation between the city
government and the company.
</P>
<P>
Volvo, one of the world's major automobile manufacturers,
entered the Chinese market in 1976, with the company's Beijing
Office established in 1993.
</P>
<P>
Leif Engstrom, the company's chief representative in Beijing,
noted that over 6,000 Volvos are currently in operation in
China. He noted that Volvo has opened 18 maintenance centers and
sales outlets across the country.
</P>
<P>
Engstrom pointed to the fact that China's automotive industry
is still relatively underdeveloped, and noted that the country
offers great opportunities for international motor vehicle
manufacturers.

three-nation business summit, which is scheduled to be held in
Dhaka on November 23, will prove to be a milestone in the
development of economic relations among India, Pakistan and
Bangladesh in particular and in the region in general.
</P>
<P>
This statement was made by Bangladeshi Foreign Minister Abdus
Samad Azad at a press conference here this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Speaking about the background of the summit, the foreign
minister said that the idea of a three-nation business summit was
put forward by Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina during the
Male Summit of the SAARC (South Asian Association for Regional
Cooperation) heads of state and government in May.
</P>
<P>
The Bangladeshi prime minister extended an invitation to the
prime ministers of India and Pakistan to join her in launching
this initiative to encourage business, trade and investment in the
region, the foreign minister said, adding that the Indian and
Pakistani prime ministers responded enthusiastically to the
proposal.
</P>

The summit will BA a one-day affair, he said, "The three prime
ministers and the ministers for foreign affairs, finance and
commerce of the three countries will participate, and business
delegations composed of representatives of leading business houses
of the three countries will also join the summit."
</P>
<P>
Speaking of the summit's objectives, the foreign minister said,
"There are several objectives."
</P>
<P>
Close interaction between the private sector and the government
in the three countries would enable mutual understanding of the
view points and challenges faced by each as the region tries to
integrate along a multitude of dimensions, he said.
</P>
<P>
The summit will provide an opportunity to review economic
policies of the three countries and to discuss ways and means to
increase trade, promote joint ventures and investment and the
setting-up of institutional and other linkages among the three
countries to increase economic cooperation, he added.
</P>
<P>
The interaction between the business and government communities
will send a clear and unconditional signal to the international
community of the strength and the resolve of the governments of
three countries to match investment opportunities and incentives
offered to foreign investors by other developing countries, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Indian Prime Minister I.K. Gujral and Pakistani Prime Minister
Nawaz Sharif will arrive in Dhaka on November 22 and 23

<HEADLINE> World Bank Report Blames Unemployment Among </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, November 17 (Xinhua) -- A draft World Bank study
on the South African labor market has found that the high level
of wages paid to workers contributed to high unemployment among
black workers, the Business Day newspaper reported today.
</P>
<P>
The draft report, which is being circulated in government and
economic think tanks, was written by World Bank economist Peter
Fallon and Nobel economics prize winner Robert Lucas.
</P>
<P>
Their examination of the effect of wages on employment found
that a 10 percent increase in black wages could lead to a 7.1
percent decline in employment.
</P>
<P>
If real black wages had remained constant between 1970 and
1994, black formal employment would have grown at an annual rate
of 1.48 percent instead of the 0.9 percent achieved.
</P>
<P>
In this scenario, employment would have been 13.3 percent
higher than its current level, they said.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that 46.9 percent of black women and 28.9
percent of black men are unemployed at present.
</P>
<P>
Wage differentials could be resolved, they argued, by removing
discrimination and barriers to mobility rather than increasing
black wages.
</P>
<P>
The report also found that the basic conditions of Employment
Bill, which passed the National Assembly on November 6, would
raise labor costs in sectors already experiencing very high
unemployment.
</P>
<P>
The bill provided for a maximum 45-hour working week and other
privileges for workers. It also included a detailed schedule to
reduce the working hours to 40.
</P>
<P>
According to a survey of South Africa's Central Statistics
Service, unemployment in South Africa was getting worse with
employment shrinking 1.5 percent since June last year.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Cabinet Dissolved </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, November 17 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's Head of State,
General Sani Abacha today announced the dissolution of his
cabinet with immediate effect in an early morning national
broadcast marking the fourth anniversary of his government.
</P>
<P>
As the military government's transition to civil rule has come
to the final state, Abacha explained that it is time to dissolve
the cabinet to enable some ministers who have demonstrated keen
interest in the coming fourth republic politics to do so.
</P>
<P>
"Under these circumstances, I feel obligated at this time to
dissolve the Federal Executive Council with immediate effect to
pave way for the constitution of a new cabinet," he said.
</P>
<P>
According to rules of the transition program, all the
government officials must resign if they want to contest in any
of the elections.
</P>
<P>
Abacha also announced the release of the political detainees
"whose release would constitute no further impediment to the
peace and security of our country."
</P>
<P>
He did not announce the names of those to be released, saying
that this will be left to the appropriate agency.
</P>
<P>
Among those detainees whose releases have been much canvassed
are Chief M.K.O. Abiola, believed to be the winner of the
annulled June 1993 presidential election, General Olusegun
Obasanjo, former head of state jailed for his role in the aborted
1995 coup.

<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, November 17 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania will re-open
its embassy in Kigali early next year, after a three-year
closure, following an improvement in the security situation in
Rwanda, "The East African" newspaper reported today.
</P>
<P>
Permanent Secretary in the Tanzanian Ministry of Foreign
Affairs, Elly Mtwango, said last week that with the return of
stability to the central African nation, Tanzania will revive its
mission.
</P>
<P>
The Tanzanian government had evacuated the embassy in 1994 in
the wake of the genocide which saw more than 500,000 members of
the minority Tutsis and some moderate Hutus massacred by their
hardline Hutu countrymen in an orgy of violence that left the
world shocked.
</P>
<P>
Tanzania's and other foreign missions based in the Rwandan
capital were not spared the violence, with rampaging mobs raiding
the embassies, looting and destroying property.
</P>
<P>
Tanzania's return to Kigali marks a major vote of confidence
in the national reconciliation and reconstruction measures
undertaken by the Rwandan government of President Pasteur
Bizimungu, the newspaper said.

<HEADLINE> Kenyan Bank's Profits Drop Sharply </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, November 17 (Xinhua) -- The Industrial Development
Bank (IDB), a leading bank in Kenya, made a net profit of 46.3
million Shillings last year, down sharply from 91.4 million
Shillings earned in the previous year, local reports said today.
</P>
<P>
The drop was attributed to a decline in the total income and
an increase in expenses, according to the bank's 1996 annual
report.
</P>
<P>
The bank recorded a deterioration in the collection of
outstanding dues from projects -- from 572.7 million Shillings in
1994/95 to 424 million Shillings in 1995/96 financial year.
Currently around 63 Shillings is equal to one U.S. Dollar.
</P>
<P>
The bank approved a total of 16 loan investment projects worth
494.4 million Shillings in 1996, compared to 224.5 million
Shillings approved during the previous year. Total disbursement
in 1996 amounted to 302.7 million Shillings.
</P>
<P>
The bank's total expenses increaseed marginally by 2.8 percent
from 555.3 million Shillings in 1994/95 to 571.1 million.
</P>
<P>
The IDB was established in 1973 to assist in the promotion,
establishment, expansion and modernization of medium and
large-scale industrial enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The bank has a medium and long-term lending program, and it
is mandated to facilitate industrial and economic development by
giving out loans.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa's Controversial Labor Bill Set to Pass </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, November 17 (Xinhua) -- After months of
wrangling, a controversial labor bill looks set to pass South
Africa's parliament, following today's approval by the Labor
Committee of the National Council of Provinces (NCOP).
</P>
<P>
According to the South African Press Association today, the
Basic Conditions of Employment Bill, which cleared the National
Assembly on November 6, will be debated by the NCOP on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The bill was supported by black-based parties like the African
National Congress, the Pan Africanist Congress and the Inkatha
Freedom Party, but was rejected by traditionally white-dominated
parties, such as the National Party, the Democratic Party and
Freedom Front.
</P>
<P>
The bill, providing for a maximum 45-hour working week and
other privileges for workers like restrictions on extra-time work
and paid maternity leave, was also opposed by certain business
organizations.
</P>
<P>
Experts fear that the bill would increase labor costs and
therefore worsen the already gloomy employment picture in the
country.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that about 47 percent of black women and 29
percent of black men are jobless.
</P>
<P>
A draft World Bank study blamed the high unemployment rate in
South Africa on high wages paid to black workers, according to a
Business Day newspaper report today.
</P>
<P>
The study, written by World Bank economist Peter Fallon and
Nobel economics laurel Robert Lucas, found that a 10 percent
increase in wages of black workers could lead to a 7.1 percent
decline in employment.
</P>
<P>
Before the bill becomes law early next year, political parties
are expected to push for new amendments.

<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, November 17 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's Head of State,
General Sani Abacha today praised his government's economic
achievement in an early morning broadcast marking the fourth
anniversary of his leadership.
</P>
<P>
He said the Nigerian economy as a whole has been recording a
steady growth of approximately four percent per annum while
foreign investment in Nigeria last year was the highest in
Africa.
</P>
<P>
In the past four years, the inflation rate has fallen from
over 100 percent to 10 percent, and the exchange rate has been
maintained at around 80 Naira to one U.S. Dollar, all indicating
the government's success in stablizing the economy, he added.
</P>
<P>
Abacha also praised his government's tight fiscal discipline.
"The massive deficits of the past have been completely turned
into a surplus," he said.
</P>
<P>
On the external sector, he said Nigeria's foreign reserves are
at an all-time high while its foreign debt was reduced from three
billion to less than 28 billion Dollars last year.
</P>
<P>
He also listed the major projects carried out by his
government. Among them is the 550 million Dollars Escravos Gas
Plant which marks the first solid step Nigeria has taken to
develop its abundant natural gas resources.
</P>
<P>
Abacha disclosed that in 1998 more emphasis will be placed on
electric power generation to ensure adequate and uninterrupted
supply nationwide.
</P>
<P>
The government will also take steps to revitalize the steel
industry and establish more export process zones, he said.

<HEADLINE> China's State Assets Gain Value </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, November 17 (Xinhua) -- The value of China's
state-owned assets has been growing at an average annual rate of
17.9 percent since 1990, according to a senior industry official.
</P>
<P>
China's state assets, which have gained in value by an average
12.4 percent since 1949 and 14.5 percent since the early 1980s,
were valued at 6.6 trillion yuan by the end of last year, said Zhu
Zhigang, deputy director-general of the State Administration of
State Property.
</P>
<P>
Zhu revealed that the total amount includes nearly 5 trillion
yuan in productive assets, with the remaining being non-productive
assets run by administrative departments and institutions. The
productive assets also include more than 120 billion yuan in
overseas assets.
</P>
<P>
The state-owned economy is in control of the national economic
lifelines, as it is dominant in such sectors as power, coal,
petroleum, metallurgy, chemicals, construction, transportation,
and posts and telecommunications, Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
He also said that solely state-owned enterprises account for 85
percent of China's total state assets while joint-venture,
cooperative and shareholding companies account for the remaining
15 percent.
</P>
<P>
In another analysis, profit-making enterprises run 74 percent
of the state-owned assets in all enterprises.

<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, November 17 (Xinhua) -- Tokyo stocks rebounded sharply today
with the key Nikkei stock price index recovering the 16,000 line for
the first time since November 6 on brisk buying.
</P>
<P>
The Nikkei average of 225 selected issues on the First Section of
the Tokyo Stock Exchange jumped 1,200.80 points, or 7.96 percent, from
last Friday's close to a session high of 16,283.32.
</P>
<P>
The broader-based Tokyo Stock Price Index (TOPIX), covering all
issues on the First Section, gained 80.33 points, or 6.82 percent, to
1,257.85.
</P>
<P>
Volume on the First Section came to an estimated 570 million
shares, down from Friday's 623.91 million shares.

Traders now see a reversed sentiment in Tokyo, with the Nikkei
average registering the eighth largest point gain in its history.
</P>
<P>
News that Hokkaido Takushoku Bank failed and will transfer its
operations in the Hokkaido area to North Pacific Bank spurred the
buying sentiment because market participants took the announcement as

bad loans.

On the Tokyo Foreign Exchange, the U.S. dollar lost its earlier
gains and drifted in the lower 125 yen level.

<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, November 17 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Prime Minister
Nawaz Sharif today appeared before the Supreme Court this morning
and denied the allegations that he committed contempt of court.
</P>
<P>
"I have neither committed contempt of court, nor do I intend to
do that," Sharif said in his written reply to the show cause
notice issued by the Supreme Court in a contempt case.
</P>
<P>
Along with 12 others including parliamentarians and government
officials, Sharif appeared before the Supreme Court in a contempt
of court case.
</P>
<P>
It was the first time in the history of Pakistan that an
elected prime minister appeared before the apex court.
</P>
<P>
Sharif's statement was read out by the counsel for the prime
minister S.M. Zafar before the five-member Bench of the Supreme
Court.
</P>
<P>
"I hold judiciary, particularly the Supreme Court of Pakistan,
in great esteem and I can never even imagine contempt of court,"
Sharif said in the statement.
</P>
<P>
"The country is passing through a very important and critical
phase, and we should devote all our energies to national causes,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
"I would do my utmost to deal with national issues with mutual
confidence and cooperation, so that work could go on more

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong Shares Rebound Sharply </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, November 17 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong share prices
rebounded sharply today to close at 10,419.75 points as primary
interest rates eased.
</P>
<P>
The key Hang Seng Index, which traced the performance of 33
blue chips, broke the 10,000-point benchmark by surging 462.42
points, the ninth biggest single-day gain in history.
</P>
<P>
Herbert Lau, an analyst of Vickers Ballas Hong Kong Limited,
said: "The interest rates are stable at around ten percent today,
creating a good market sentiment for property and finance
sectors."
</P>
<P>
The primary three-month interbank lending rates hit 15 percent
early last week and went down to about 10 percent at the weekend.
Property led the rebound by rocketing 773.65 points today, and
finance shares gained 574.62 points.
</P>
<P>
Turnover shrank to 11.1 billion HK dollars (1.4 billion U.S.
dollars), showing that investors still stand sideline to watch the
market direction.
</P>
<P>
"The outlook is not clear and the market is still volatile for
the fear that further speculative attacks might push up the
interest rates again," said Lau.
</P>
<P>
Interest rates were jacked up to record high as the Hong Kong
Monetary Authority tried to fend off currency speculators in
October.

<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, November 17 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items
in leading French newspapers today:
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- Georges Marchais, the man who incarnated the French Communist
Party (PCF) for nearly a quarter of a century, its setbacks and its
contradictions, died on Sunday of heart disease at the age of 77. At
the top of the PCF from 1972 until 1994, the former metallurgist and
man of status quo had never cut the umbilical cord with Moscow. His
rule accompanied the decline of the party.
</P>
<P>
-- Iraq installed on Sunday dozens of families as human shield
against a possible American attack which the former coalition of the
Gulf War is pressuring Washington not to launch. The regime of
Saddam Hussein continues to prepare for the strikes and the country
has opened its palaces, factories, electric centers and refineries
to ``civilian volunteers.''
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- While Washington is looking for support to its arms-wrestling
with Irak, international opposition to a military action against
Iraq prevailed on Sunday. The United States has asked Russia and
France to use their influence to help solve the crisis with Iraq.
French President Jacques Chirac has expressed his ``solidarity''
with the United States but said that sanctions against Iraq should
be lifted as soon as the country has applied the United Nations
Security Council resolutions.
</P>
<P>
-- Georges Marchais, the man who incarnated a French Communist
Party (PCF) very loyal to Moscow, died on Sunday in hospital of
heart problems. Very much connected with the Communist Party of
former USSR, Marchais signed the common program of the French left
with Francois Mitterrand in 1974 before breaking with the leftist
union in 1977.

MOSCOW, November 17 (Xinhua) -- Russia will not allow the
United States to strengthen its position in the oil zone in the
Caspian Sea, First Deputy Prime Minister Boris Nemtsov said today.
</P>
<P>
In a televised interview, Nemtsov indicated that Russia should
act as a leading member in the sea.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the oil exploitation in the Caspian, he said
Russia has missed an opportunity and allowed the United States to
take the lead in joint oil exploration with Azerbaijan.
</P>
<P>
Russia can only make up for the losses by developing Iran's
oilfields, Nemtsov said, adding Russian oil firms should
participate in the development of the oilfields in the Caspian.
</P>
<P>
The Caspian Sea, the largest landlocked sea in the world, has
proven oil reserves of 28 billion barrels and a large amount of
natural gas resources.
</P>
<P>
As one of the five littoral states, Russia holds that the
Caspian natural resources should only be jointly explored by the
littoral countries. The other four are Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan,
Azerbaijan and Iran.

<HEADLINE> Former S. African President May Face Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, November 17 (Xinhua) -- Former South African
president P W Botha may be brought to a legal process since he said he
would not appear before the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC),
local media reported today.
</P>
<P>
Botha said in an interview with a Sunday Afrikaans newspaper,
Rapport, that he would rather be taken to court and charged because he
was not prepared to appear before the TRC, a special court to heal the
wounds of the apartheid.
</P>
<P>
TRC chairman, Archbishop Desmond Tutu, Sunday responded with
disappointment with the report and said if that was the case the law
would take its course.
</P>
<P>
Although Tutu didn't elaborate, it is understood that the next step
will be for the commission to decide whether to lay a charge against
Botha in terms of the Promotion of National Unity and Reconciliation
Act.
</P>
<P>
Under the act, anyone who has been subpoenaed does not appear
before the TRC without sufficient cause, he or she faces a fine, up to
two years' jail, or both.
</P>
<P>
Botha was subpoenaed at the end of September to testify in the
mid-October state security council hearing, but refused to appear,
citing health problems.
</P>
<P>
The TRC is expected to hold a second round of hearing in George,
Western Cape, a place close to his retirement home.
</P>
<P>
"I am very sad at the way in which Mr P W Botha has appeared almost
to have thrown down a gauntlet to the TRC in a newspaper interview
published today (Sunday)," Tutu said.
</P>
<P>
The TRC waited since the beginning of the year for answers to
questions which it submitted to Botha in accordance with an agreement
made with him last year, he said.
</P>
<P>
Tutu said the TRC made special representations to the
government to enable Botha to have necessary legal assistance in order
to provide the necessary answers.
</P>
<P>
The TRC also proposed a special hearing to accommodate Botha after
his representatives indicated that he was not well enough to travel to
Johannesburg last month to attend the hearing on the role of the
former State Security Council.
</P>
<P>
Botha said he would not apologize for the role of his government in
the apartheid era and would not appear before the TRC.
</P>
<P>
"I will not apologize for the struggle against Marxist
revolutionary attacks which led to the mutilation and death of
innocent civilians," Botha said.
</P>
<P>
He said he would not be threatened and that the TRC could take him
to court if it wanted to.
</P>
<P>
He also attacked the TRC, saying the commission has gradually been
turned into a revenge camp against the Afrikaner.
</P>
<P>
"The truth is simply that the commission does not bring
reconciliation, but is trying to tear the Afrikaner and the South
African nation apart."

reported today.
</P>
<P>
As another giant South African company, Metro Cash and Carry,
starts a wholesale outlet in Nairobi, local exporters are crying
foul over Pretoria's protectionist policies which bar products
from other countries.
</P>
<P>
Although the growth of Kenya's exports to South Africa, mainly
agricultural produce including fruit, tea and coffee, has been
impressive, more products have been shut out by license
restrictions, high tariffs and unfair trade practices, they said.
</P>
<P>
Kenya's Export Promotion Council (EPC) said that import duties
levied on Kenyan goods by South Africa have been high and import
quotas imposed on South African distributors of Kenyan goods have
discouraged companies intending to export to that country.
</P>
<P>
The EPC said Kenya should either join the Southern African
Development Community in order to enjoy preferential treatment
and avoid restrictions imposed on its products by South Africa,
or impose retaliatory taxes on South African goods.
</P>
<P>
Kenyan textiles attract import duties of as high as 84
percent, making them uncompetitive in South Africa, said the
report.
</P>
<P>
South Africa also dictates that the country's importers of
Kenyan tea and some other products must buy an equivalent
quantity of domestic products.
</P>
<P>
Among the cases cited by Kenya to illustrate South Africa's
"unfair" trade practices is Pretoria's refusal, until early this
year, to license imports of cut pineapple from Del Monte (Kenya)
Ltd..
</P>
<P>
In contrast, entry into Kenya by South African products such
as wines, chemicals, motor vehicles, beer and textiles has been
easy as they are heavily subsidized, said the report.
</P>
<P>
Director of External Trade at the Kenyan Ministry of Commerce
and Industry L.M. Nderi said last week that the situation had not
improved much despite the launch of talks two years ago between
the two governments to remove barriers to trade.
</P>
<P>
"There is no level playing field in trade between the two
countries as their exports to us are subsidized wile tariff
barriers against us are high," he said.
</P>
<P>
The complaints from Kenya came despite a huge increase in
exports of Kenyan products to South Africa.
</P>
<P>
The EPC valued the country's exports to South Africa in 1996
at 2.38 billion Shillings (37.2 million U.S. Dollars), a growth
of 300 percent since 1994.
</P>
<P>
But Kenyan exporters attribute this growth to an expected
natural expansion following the end of apartheid in South Africa,
which opened up the South African market to the world.
</P>
<P>
During the same period, South African exports to Kenya rose by
45 percent, making Kenya its fourth largest export market in
Africa after its traditional trading partners in southern Africa.

<HEADLINE> Australia to Test Million-Round-a-Minute Gun </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, November 17 (Xinhua) -- An Australian-designed and
built "21st century weapon", a rapid-fire super gun capable of
firing more than one million rounds a minute, is to undergo
evaluation tests by the National Defense Science and Technology
Organization (DSTO), local media reported today.
</P>
<P>
The gun, named Metal Storm, is electronically operated and the
first gun in the world to fire without the conventional mechanical
operations, the Australian Associated Press (AAP) reported.
</P>
<P>
It has already undergone successful testing by U.S. defense
officials and is said to have exceeded the criteria set by them,
AAP said.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Richard Brabin-Smith, head of DSTO, who signed the
evaluation agreement in Canberra today with inventor Mike O'Dwyer
from Brisbane, said Metal Storm's enormous rate of fire power
would be extremely beneficial in a number of combat situations.
</P>
<P>
It could be a highly successful anti-missile ship defense
system, literally blasting approaching missiles out of the sky
with an impenetrable wall of bullets.
</P>
<P>
O'Dwyer, managing director of Metal Storm Pty Ltd, said the
technology used in Metal Storm could also be used as a
landmine-clearing system. The company is 30 percent owned by
listed company Charter Pacific Corporation Limited in Queensland
state, east Australia.
</P>
<P>
He said because Metal Storm was an electronic firing system it
was possible to have it programmed for use by a single user or
group of users.
</P>
<P>
The technology had attracted worldwide interest, especially
from the Department of Defense of the United States, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Agreements are being negotiated with two U.S. defense
companies. Today's DSTO agreement positions Australia at the
forefront of the use of high technology by the defense industry
and raises the possibility of joint Australian-American
development," O'Dwyer said.
</P>
<P>
O'Dwyer said he was not an engineer, but had a background in
retailing and it had been a long hard job to convince U.S. defense
officials that he had invented a gun everyone had said could not
be successfully designed.

<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, November 17 (Xinhua) -- Seventeen people died
instantly while eight others were seriously injured after a
mini-bus overturned at noon of Sunday in north Tanzania's Mara
Region, the police said.
</P>
<P>
The Mara Regional Police Commander, Josiah Mwesiga, told the
press over the telephone that the mini-bus had hit an embankment
at a road junction some five kilometers from the town of Tarime.
</P>
<P>
Eleven of the deceased, including the driver, have been
identified, Mwesiga said, adding that the police has appealed to
residents to visit the district hospital in Tarime to help
identify the other six dead persons.
</P>
<P>
The eight injured people suffered from fractures of their
limbs, he said. However, some people's health were reported to
have been improving steadily.
</P>
<P>
The police is still investigating the circumstances of the
accident, but speedy driving is probably to have led to the
tragedy.
</P>
<P>
The accident was the worst in the region in two years after 18
people died and 50 others were injured when their bus collided
head-on with a Landrover at Kibakari village.

TEHRAN, November (Xinhua) -- Iran had denied the reports that
one of its diplomats was arrested in Moscow for attempting to
secure missile know-how, the official news agency IRNA reported
today.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference Sunday, Iranian Foreign Ministry
spokesman Mahmoud Mohammadi confirmed the arrest of an Iranian
citizen in Russia, but said that the detainee was not a staff
member of the Iranian Embassy in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
He described the claim that the person was trying to secure
missile technology for Iran as "baseless," saying that
Iranian-Russian cooperation in all fields was aboveboard.
</P>
<P>
He accused Israel of spreading the rumor as part of its
propaganda campaign to divert international attention from its
expansionist policy in the occupied Arab land.
</P>
<P>
But so far no details were available about the arrest of the
Iranian national in Russia.

<HEADLINE> Zambia Expected to Net 48 Million Dollars of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, November 17 (Xinhua) -- Zambia is expected to make a
budget surplus of 62 Kwacha (about 48 million U.S. Dollars) this
year, 12.3 million Dollars more than last year.
</P>
<P>
Zambia Daily Mail today quoted a director with the Bank of
Zambia, Feliix Kani, as saying that the first quarter of this
year registered a budget deficit of 19 billion Kwacha (about 14.6
million Dollars) but it was offset by June which accumulated a
surplus of 27 billion Kwacha (about 20.8 million Dollars).
</P>
<P>
In September, another surplus of 46 billion Kwacha (about 35.4
million Dollars) was registered.
</P>
<P>
"For this year we envisaged a budget surplus of 62 billion
Kwacha. There is just one month remaining to the close of the
year and we are very close to achieving that," Kani said.
</P>
<P>
The growth target for 1997 is 5.5 percent but so far real
growth is expected to be between three and five percent. The 62
billion Kwacha surplus translates into one percent growth of GDP
already, according to Kani.
</P>
<P>
Although agriculture slackened due to late deliveries of
inputs, there has been a strong performance in non-traditional
exports especially in the tourism sector, construction and
manufacturing, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said under the International Monetary Fund (IMF) program
Zambia implemented, the country is operating a cash budget
and this surplus is a cash-based surplus.

<HEADLINE> Kenyan Nurses, Laboratory Technicians Seek Pay </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, November 17 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan nurses and laboratory
technicians are demanding an up to 500 present salary increment
within 14 days or they launch a strike, local reports said today.
</P>
<P>
The Association of Kenya Medical Laboratory Scientific
Officers (AKMLSO) southern Nyanza branch said they will not
accept anything short of a 10,000-Shilling (158.7 U.S. Dollars)
risk allowance per month instead of the present 400 Shillings
(6.35 U.S. Dollars).
</P>
<P>
"As the backbone of health-care in the country, we are exposed
to infectious diseases such as AIDS/HIV, TB, Cholera and others
and unless we are given a better risk allowance, our next move is
to down our tools," they said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Nurses representatives from Kuria, Suba, Migori, Rachuonyo and
Homa Bay districts in Nyanza Province, where cholera were rampant
a month ago, said they had resolved to jointly participate in the
strike set for November 28.
</P>
<P>
The move was reportedly supported by the AKMLSO headquarters,
which also threatened to take "alternative action" if the
government did not assure them of "adequate remuneration within
21 days."
</P>
<P>
In a letter to the Ministry of Health, the association
petitioned the government to implement pay rise recommendations
it gave to a government-appointed committee in charge of
reviewing civil servants salaries.

New Nigerian

<P>
-- Mixed feelings have greeted attempts to persuade Nigeria's
head of state General Sani Abacha to contest the 1998
presidential election with allegations that such attempts have
been responsible for the stifling of political ambitions in the
country.
</P>
<P>
-- The wave of conflicts in Africa is a manifestation of a
renewed scramble for the continent by imperialist forces which
Africa must resist, OAU Secretary-general Salim Ahmed Salim said
in a letter presented to the Nigerian government on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
This Day

with immediate effect to pave way for the constitution of a new
cabinet.

<HEADLINE> Israel Seeks to Expand Trade Links with Arabs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DOHA, November 17 (Xinhua) -- Israelis are active in
approaching Arab businessmen at an on-going regional economic
conference here which is facing a widespread Arab boycott
against Israel's role in bogging down the Mideast peace process.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli delegation, led by Minister of Industry and Trade
Natan Sharansky, has seen the possibility of expanding the
Israeli-Arab business dealings.
</P>
<P>
The delegation has been talking to "enough Arab businessmen"
attending the three-day fourth Middle East and North Africa
economic conference which was opened Sunday, a delegation member
told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
Half of the 68-member delegation are businessmen coming from
various sectors ranging from high-tech to equities, he said.
</P>
<P>
Sharansky told reporters here today that some Arab countries
have expressed their interest in an Israeli-Jordanian joint
venture deal signed here Sunday to establish an industrial zone
in Irbid in northern Jordan.
</P>
<P>
The Irbid Qualifying Industrial Zone will cover an area of 200
hectares. Products made in the zone can enter the U.S. market with
a duty-free entry. But this benefit is available to Egypt, Israel
and Jordan only.
</P>
<P>
Sharansky did not rule out the possibility for other Arab
countries to follow suit.
</P>
<P>
Jordan is one of the few Arab countries doing business with
Israel in a public way, while many Arab countries have been
imposing a collective economic block against Israel for decades
in protest against Israeli occupation of Arab land.
</P>
<P>
But still, many Israeli products bearing non-Israeli labels
can be seen in Arab markets like Syria and Iran. "The boycott
(of the conference) is only in political words, but not in
business dealings," an Israeli analyst made the comment to
Xinhua, asking her name not to be mentioned.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, Sharansky said that Jordan and Israel will start
to discuss the establishment of a bilateral free trade zone next
month.
</P>
<P>
Another major project under discussion during the conference
is Israel's purchase of gas, with any one of Egypt, Qatar or
Russia, the minister said. This project used to be considered
canceled due to the boycott.
</P>
<P>
Arab leading countries like Egypt, Saudi Arabia and the United
Arab Emirates are joining the political boycott camp, but the
business representation is much wider.
</P>
<P>
Many Arab countries said holding Arab-Israeli economic
conference like the Doha will undermine the Arab economic block
against Israel and thus deprive Arabs of bargaining chips in
peace negotiations and reward Israel's hardline policy.
</P>
<P>
Israelis' campaign to seek expansion of business links with
Arabs is of more significance in political rather than economic
terms, the Israeli analyst said, adding "for Israel, the Doha
conference is ideal for doing a public relation job."

<TEXT>
<P>
DOHA, November 17 (Xinhua) -- Israel said today that it will
not oppose the holding of next year's Middle East and North
Africa (MENA) economic conference in the Palestinian self-rule
area.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Minister of Industry and Trade Natan Sharansky was
commenting on a proposal put forward at the on-going three-day
Doha MENA conference, which opened here Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Palestine is one of the options for the next MENA gathering,
but "the question is open," Sharansky told reporters here. But he
did not give further details.
</P>
<P>
Behind the proposal favoring Palestine as the next host are
apparently some considerations concerning the stalled Mideast
peace process due to Israel's hardline policy, observers said.
</P>
<P>
The majority of the Arab countries are boycotting the Doha
conference because of Israel's participation. Therefore, the Doha
gathering, the fourth in a series, has been downgraded from a
summit to a ministerial one.

CANBERRA, November 17 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar
received a burst of life today, strengthening against its U.S.
counterpart, as regional equity markets lifted their game.
</P>
<P>
The local unit settled at 70.15 U.S. cents, the first time it
had closed above the 70.00 U.S. cent level in more than a week.
</P>
<P>
It was substantially higher than the 69.90 U.S. cent close late
Friday but off its high for today's session of 70.50 U.S. cents.
</P>
<P>
Societe Generale chief economist Glenn Maguire said the
economic data last week revealed the extent to which the
Australian currency has become decoupled from the domestic
economic fundamentals.
</P>
<P>
"This circumstance is somewhat frustrating for Australian
dollar bulls, however, it does raise the possibility that when
market attention returns to the Australian fundamentals, there
could be quite a strong bounce in the Australian dollar," Maguire
said.

The Australian dollar was at 87.85 yen from 87.84 previously,
and at 1.2174 marks, from 1.2048 marks.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar Should Not Be Left out of ASEM: Mahathir </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, November 17 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar, as it is now a
member of ASEAN, should not be excluded from the Asia-Europe
Meeting (ASEM) in London next year, Malaysian Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad said today.
</P>
<P>
Keeping Myanmar out would not help bring about the changes that
were expected of Yangon, Mahathir said at a joint news conference
with French President Jacques Chirac after their talks in
Langkawi, a resort island in Northern Malaysia, where Chirac
arrived yesterday for an overnight working visit.
</P>
<P>
"ASEAN views that there should be direct contact with the
people of Myanmar because in that way, it can help influence them
in accepting the kind of norms the world seems to be insisting
on," he was quoted by the Malaysian national news agency Bernama
as saying.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir gave his view while replying to a French journalist
who wanted to know his stand on Myanmar's exclusion from the
meeting.
</P>
<P>
To lay conditions on Myanmar is not conducive to boosting
dialogue between regional partners, Mahathir said, adding "We
should determine who represents ASEAN or Southeast Asian
countries (for ASEM). It is for us to decide."
</P>
<P>
Myanmar, together with Laos was admitted into ASEAN
(Association of Southeast Asian Nations) last July.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN also groups Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines,
Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.

<HEADLINE> Philippines to Conduct Cloud-Seeding to Induce Rains </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, November 17 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel
Ramos has ordered the military to conduct cloud-seeding to induce
artificial rains to ease the effect of El Nino, a senior military
official said here today.
</P>
<P>
Chief of Staff of the Armed Forces Arnulfo Acedera said the
order came today after Ramos approved the release of 131 million
pesos (4 million U.S. dollars) to finance the cloud-seeding
operations.
</P>
<P>
Acedera said that prior to the operations, the armed forces
would first manufacture the must-needed nucleating agents and
acquire burner gas to gasify the agents.
</P>
<P>
"Cloud-seeding operations will continue as long as there is a
need for artificial simulation of rains," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Philippines, being hit by drought, is facing a water
crisis. President Ramos has called the public to conserve and
recycle water and speed up the construction of irrigation projects
in the country.

<HEADLINE> Singapore Manufacturing Output Up in September </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, November 17 (Xinhua) -- Singapore's output of
manufactured products increased by 13.4 percent in September,
marking the fourth consecutive rise this year, the Economic
Development Board (EDB) said here today.
</P>
<P>
"The increase was broad-based, with high growth in the
electronics, chemicals, machinery and transport equipment
industries," the EDB observed.
</P>
<P>
The electronics industry grew by 16.3 percent year-on-year in
September, it said, adding that the increase was the industry's
highest and fourth consecutive growth this year.
</P>
<P>
All major segments expanded except for consumer electronics, as
there was higher demand for higher value-added chips and printed
circuit boards assembled. Output growth of disk drive and
telecommunication equipment was still healthy albeit at a slower
rate of growth, the EDB said.
</P>
<P>
The chemicals industries expanded by 15.6 percent in September,
while cumulative output for the first nine months of 1997 was 17.1
percent. The petrochemical industry maintained its high growth in
September, with output of petrochemical products increasing by
125.1 percent, contributed mainly by the additional capacities in
the industry.
</P>
<P>
The output of the petroleum industry increased by 12 percent,
while the cumulative output for the first nine months of the year
grew by only 0.3 percent compared to the same period in 1996 as
output was relatively low in the first six months.
</P>
<P>
The output of machinery increased by 26.4 percent in September
because of higher output of lifting machinery, machine tools and
conversion work done on an oil rig.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the output of pharmaceuticals declined by 39.7
percent in September. But the cumulative output for the first nine
months increased by 4.1 percent compared to the same period of
last year.

<HEADLINE> Chinese, Polish Presidents Hold Talks in Beijing   (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 17 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin
expressed the hope here today that his country and Poland would
make joint efforts to establish bilateral ties with a perspective
towards the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
During his talks with visiting Polish President Aleksander
Kwasniewski, Jiang said that the visit of his Polish counterpart
will help to further the traditional friendship between people of
the two countries, and enhance bilateral ties to a higher level.
</P>
<P>
Kwasniewski agreed with Jiang, saying the visit will make a
positive contribution to friendship and cooperation between the
two countries.
</P>
<P>
During the 90-minute talk, the two leaders exchanged views on
furthering the friendly ties and international issues with common
concern.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that, although great changes had taken place in the
world as well as in the two countries over recent years, the
Sino-Polish bilateral ties continued their stable development and
will stand the test of time. The two countries have maintained
high-level frequent contacts, expanded exchanges and cooperation
in fields of economics, science and technology, culture and
education, as well as understand and support each other on many
international issues, Jiang added.
</P>
<P>
President Jiang attributed the following factors as reasons why
bilateral ties could develop so smoothly:
</P>
<P>
-- Advancing bilateral friendly cooperation is the common wish
of the people of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
-- There are extensive common interests rather than conflict of
fundamental interests between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
-- Both countries can handle bilateral ties by disregarding
the differences in their social systems, ideology and values.
</P>
<P>
-- China and Poland can strictly follow the principles of mutual
respect, equality and mutual non-interference into each other's
internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
Touching upon two-way trade, Jiang said China regards economic
cooperation with Poland as an important component part of
bilateral ties, and Poland is China's major trade partner in
eastern Europe.

<P>
Recent years have shown constant growth in two-way trade and
the steady increase of trade volume, Jiang said, adding that the
two sides also tried to maintain a balanced trade by strengthening
the exchanges of companies and business communities of the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
China welcomes Polish businesses to enter the Chinese market,
participating in large projects such as the Three Gorges project,
he said, adding that the two countries should encourage and
support their businesses and regions with strength and good
reputations to increase contacts and understanding, and explore
various kinds of economic and technological cooperation on
different levels and in various ways.
</P>
<P>
China will also spur its businesses to compete in the Polish
market, Jiang noted.
</P>
<P>
Kwasniewski said Poland pays great attention to its economic
cooperation with China, and that there is potential in this
regard. The Polish entrepreneurs accompanying him on the tour said
they hoped for in-depth discussions with their Chinese
counterparts, Kwasniewski said.
</P>
<P>
Poland also hopes to expand its exchanges and cooperation with
China in the fields of culture, sports, science and technology, he
added.
</P>
<P>
Jiang gave a briefing on his recent visit to the United States,
Russian President Boris Yeltsin's China trip, and China's foreign
policy.
</P>
<P>
He expressed his appreciations to the Polish president and the
Polish government's adherence to the "one China" policy. He also
said that China understands Poland's policy of giving priority to
pursuing ties with European countries.
</P>
<P>
Kwasniewski invited Jiang to visit Poland at his convenience,
and Jiang accepted the invitation.
</P>
<P>
After the talk, the two heads of state signed a joint
communique, and officials from the two sides also signed an
agreement of cooperation on the quarantine of animals and animal
hygiene, as well as an implementation plan for bilateral cultural
and scientific cooperation from 1998 to 2000.
</P>
<P>
Prior to the talk, President Jiang presided at a ceremony in
honor of President Kwasniewski.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, the two countries also reached four agreements on
bilateral economic cooperation.

<HEADLINE> Indian Airport Operators to Strike for Higher wages </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, November 17 (Xinhua) -- Operators of air traffic
controllers (ATC) in India on Sunday said they will disrupt flight
movement at all airports from next week by stopping work for one
hour each time for four times a day to press for higher wages.
</P>
<P>
Today's local press reports quoted Brijendra Shekhar, general
secretary of the ATC Guild, said that complete stoppage of work
was also possible.
</P>
<P>
He said that the work stoppage will begin on November 21.
</P>
<P>
The ATC Guild, which demands a wage hike and other benefits for
ATC operators, has in the past two weeks been on a slow agitation
disrupting and delaying flights at major Indian airports such as
Delhi, Bangalore, Bombay, Calcutta and Chennai (Madras).
</P>
<P>
But the disruption has not been continuous and shifted from one
airport to another without causing chaos in all airports.
</P>
<P>
"We have decided to intensify the agitation," said R. K. Singh,
president of the ATC Guild, indicating that the path of "direct
action" was the only option for mounting pressure on the airport
authority of India.
</P>
<P>
An agitation move by ATC operators half a year ago led to the
suspension of all domestic and international flights over India,
the ripples of which was felt all over the Asia-Pacific region.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Peasants Love Local Opera (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HOHHOT, November 17 (Xinhua) -- The curtain rose with two
thousand eyes fixed on the simply built plank stage. With a rapid
beating of gongs and drums, a young boy in traditional costume
performed a series of somersaults from the left to the right of
the stage followed by thunderous applause in this remote village.
</P>
<P>
A theatrical troupe was performing a type of Chinese local
opera known as Manhan opera in Xingshuxi, a village in northern
China's Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
The story told about a warrior fighting to the death on a
battlefield. When the warrior bid farewell to his wife before
going to the front, a woman under the stage with her baby sleeping
in her arms got misty-eyed.
</P>
<P>
The three-hour performance attracted all the villagers, who
rallied around the stage long before the performance. They were
dressed in their best clothes usually worn during festivals.
</P>
<P>
Liu Jinyu, a rural teacher, walked 15 kilometers from a nearby
village to enjoy the play.
</P>
<P>
Jiao Bingquan, 63, said they can only watch such a play once or
twice a year.
</P>
<P>
A young man, Bian Liang, pointing at a girl beside him, said
they met last time when they went to the play one year ago and
fell in love with each other.
</P>
<P>
"It's a good chance to meet friends while watching opera," Bian
said.
</P>
<P>
Chinese peasants have a long history of watching local
operas. Many of the opera's subjects are historic stories. Old men
often told the ancient stories to their children and
grandchildren. Many stories have been performed hundreds of years.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Peasants Love Local Operas (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In recent years, modern media such as television have entered
China's rural areas, affecting the development of traditional
local operas, some of which have disappeared.
</P>
<P>
However, some new types of dramas close to the farmer's life
have been developed. More than 300 types of local operas have been
developed in China, with 80 new types such as the Manhan Opera.
</P>
<P>
Manhan Opera, popular in the western region of Inner Mongolia,
is performed mainly by two persons. The unique style of opera has
assimilated the traditional Mongolian songs and dances.
</P>
<P>
Compared with well-known Chinese operas such as the Peking
Opera, Manhan Opera and many other local operas are not fully
developed as an artistic form. The costumes, properties and the
melody of the operas are much simpler.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Chinese farmers showed great interest in local
operas, which usually tell stories about the marriage, family
problems and the work of Chinese farmers. The performers, many of
whom are farmers, can be either professionals or amateurs.
</P>
<P>
Guan Yiquan, head of the Manhan troupe founded in 1986, said
his group has performed in China's countryside more than 100 times
last year, with the audience surpassing 100,000.
</P>
<P>
Guan added that his troupe has been awarded more than 50
national prizes, including the Plum Blossom Prize, China's most
prestigious prize in theatrical circles.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh Takes Measures to Help Retarded: PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, November 17 (Xinhua) -- Bangladeshi Prime Minister
Sheikh Hasina has said her government is considering with due
importance the setting up of a national institute for the mentally
retarded.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister made this statement while inaugurating the
week-long 13th Asian Conference on Mental Retardation in Dhaka
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"Rights of persons with mental retardation: role of government
and UN agencies in Asia," is the theme of the conference, being
held for the first time in the country with the representation of
400 mentally disabled persons, including 150 from different Asian
countries.
</P>
<P>
The government is pledge-bound to ensure proper upbringing of
the disabled through care, education and training, the independent
United News of Bangladesh (UNB) quoted the prime minister as
saying.
</P>
<P>
"The government will do its utmost for the welfare of the
mentally retarded persons of the country," she stated.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister called upon all including the UN agencies
working in the country to assist in resolving the acute problem.
</P>
<P>
According to the organizers of the conference, Bangladesh has
1.2 million mentally retarded persons, of which only 3,500 are
getting institutional support.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister said, "the mentally retarded persons are not
a burden of the society. They can also contribute a lot in the
development activities if they are provided with necessary
treatment, nursing, education and training."
</P>
<P>
The government is planning to set up a national institute for
the mentally retarded, the prime minister said, adding that ten
percent job quota in government service has been reserved for the

<HEADLINE> Herbal Medicine Seeds Return from Space Flight </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARBIN, November 17 (Xinhua) -- Chinese scientists today
obtained the second-generation seeds of a popular Chinese herbal
medicine after exposure to radiation in outer space.
</P>
<P>
Experts here said it is the first time in the world that
Chinese herbal-medicine seeds were treated in a retrievable
satellite resulting in better quality seeds.
</P>
<P>
The space breeding of herbal-medicine seeds is of epoch-making
importance, experts said, and the next step involves production
of medical herbs in other countries.
</P>
<P>
Liu Zhongshen, director of the Biological Medicine Center of
Heilongjiang University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, said the
space-treated seeds of Huangqin or bailkal skullcap root, are
apparently different from ordinary ones.
</P>
<P>
He said the germination period of the space-treated seeds is
much shorter than that of the ordinary ones and that the space
seeds have longer and stronger roots and the stems are taller.
</P>
<P>
The Huangqin root seeds were carried by China's JB retrievable
satellite for a 15-day space journey. Scientists said the
chromosome distortion of the space seeds make their quality much
better.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese herbal medicines have been applied for treating a
variety of diseases for more than 2,500 years and the Huangqin is
one of the most commonly used herbal medicines among 400 kinds of
commonly used herbal medicines.
</P>
<P>
Doctors practicing traditional Chinese medicine said Huangqin
effectively clears away heat and toxins. It is being used in more
than 40 percent of traditional Chinese medical prescriptions.
</P>
<P>
Its herbal medicine could be used for treatment of pneumonia,
infection of the respiratory tract, high blood pressure, nephritis
and hepatitis.
</P>
<P>
The herbal medicine could be harvested after three or four
years; the wild ones have been sharply reduced due to
overpicking.
</P>
<P>
In usual cases the main stem of the Huangqin would become
withered. The man-plant Huangqin breed is in its third year of
growth.
</P>
<P>
To alter its structure, Chinese scientists began to breed space
seeds to improve the herbal medicine's quality.
</P>
<P>
The Huangqin space seed project is expected to take four years
to complete.
</P>
<P>
So far, China has successfully launched space-seed breeding of
51 varieties of crops.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Eyes U.N. Procurement Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, November 17 (Xinhua) -- The Thai government is urging
local firms to pay more attention to the United Nations market,
saying the market is worth some 4 billion U.S. dollars each year.
</P>
<P>
Thailand will see more opportunities as the U.N. has assigned
its procurement agencies to increase its purchasing ratio from
developing countries, said Sanit Vorapanya, director-general of
the Export Promotion Department of the Thai Commerce Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Medicine and medical supplies, food, communication equipment,
vehicles, construction equipment, garments, textiles and kitchen
equipment are the goods which the U.N. is interested in, today's
local press reports quoted Sanit as saying.
</P>
<P>
Most Thai businessmen have a little knowledge on how to sell
goods to the U.N. and they should take the opportunity to learn
the procedures and increase their sales to the U.N. when its teams
visit Thailand, Sanit said.
</P>
<P>
Asda Jayanama, a Thai representative to the U.N. said that
companies wanting to do business with the U.N. should register
with one of the U.N. agencies and tender their procurement
methods.
</P>
<P>
Currently, only seven Thai companies have registered with U.N.
agencies, Asda said.
</P>
<P>
Toshiyki Niwa, U.N. assistant secretary-general, said during a
recent visit to Thailand that U.N. purchases depend on quality,
delivery, after-sales services and pricing.
</P>
<P>
He said in his opinion Thai goods generally meet these
standards, but he expressed the hope that Thai businessmen would
offer low prices.
</P>
<P>
Peter Adler, a U.N. procurement officer, said last year 45
percent of the U.N. total purchase was from developing countries
and the U.N. bought more from Thailand than from Indonesia,
Malaysia and Singapore together.
</P>
<P>
Adler said that most goods the U.N. purchased were food and
consumer products and that the U.N. is planning to increase
purchases of manufactured goods like electronic products in the
future.
</P>
<P>
He foresaw that U.N. purchases from Thailand will rise in the
future due to more attractive price offers from Thailand.

<TEXT>
<P>
ZHENGZHOU, November 17 (Xinhua) -- Central China's Henan
Province has reaped a record-high 39 billion kilograms of
grain this year.
</P>
<P>
The output is 1.4 percent higher than that of last year, which
also set a record.
</P>
<P>
The harvest has been attributed to an especially good summer
grain output, which was 3.48 billion kilograms higher than the
previous year.
</P>
<P>
Owing to drought, however, autumn's grain harvest was 2.93
billion kilograms lower than the previous year.

<HEADLINE> French President Supports Malaysia to Regulate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, November 17 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques
Chirac today gave full support to Malaysia's proposal for
regulations to be introduced for currency trading.
</P>
<P>
Chirac agreed there should be regulations in currency trading
so that there would not be an anarchy, Malaysian Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad said today after holding talks with Chirac in
Langkawi, a resort island in Northern Malaysia, where Chirac
arrived yesterday for an overnight working visit.
</P>
<P>
"Chirac is not saying that we should restrict but there should
not be an anarchy, this is being able to raise 20 times your
capital through leverage. That's something that needs to be
investigated by the IMF (International Monetary Fund)," Mahathir
was quoted by reports reaching here as telling local reporters
there.
</P>
<P>
According to the reports, Chirac informed Mahathir that he
(Chirac) had spoken to IMF Managing Director Michel Camdessus over
the telephone last night.
</P>
<P>
The French president also agreed that the Group of 15 (G-15)
developing countries should be represented when the Group of Seven
(G-7) industrialized countries discuss the currency issue.
</P>
<P>
Chirac believed that the G-15 and G-7 must have a closer
relation because whatever the G-7 decided had an implication on
the G15, Mahathir said.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said that Chirac was in favor of having a G-15
representative in the G-7 and had asked Malaysia to initiate
efforts towards that.
</P>
<P>
On the United States probe into a gas deal in Iran involving
Malaysian and French petroleum companies, Mahathir said France's
stand was similar to Malaysia's, that is, no country should decide
for another.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said: "Even France is against sanctions like us. These
are not the World Trade Organization's rules but merely one
country's decision."
</P>
<P>
The Malaysian leader said Chirac, in fact, wanted further
cooperation with Malaysia's oil company Petronas in other areas
and not just confined to Iran.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Deputy Secretary of State for Energy, Sanctions and
Commodities William Ramsay is due to arrive here tomorrow to probe
the 2 billion joint venture between Petronas, France's Total SA
and Russia's Gazprom in Iran.
</P>
<P>
Chirac is in Malaysia after attending a gathering of
French-speaking countries in Hanoi, Vietnam. His visit is the
first by a French head of state to Malaysia. He leaves later
today.

<HEADLINE> Peace Agreement Hopeful Between Government, Rebels: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, November 17 (Xinhua) -- President Fidel Ramos said here
today that he remained hopeful that a comprehensive peace
agreement between the Philippine government and the National
Democratic Front (NDF) rebels will be signed soon.
</P>
<P>
Ramos said reports that the two sides had suspended their peace
talks were not correct, adding it was only the formal talks that
were severed.
</P>
<P>
The government recently halted its formal peace talks with the
NDF after members of the rebel group killed several policemen and
took two police officers hostages in two attacks.
</P>
<P>
Ramos said the peace negotiations between the government and
the NDF were composed of two tracks and that the informal talks
will continue. He described the suspension of the formal talks as
just a "temporary setback".
</P>
<P>
The NDF is one of the three major rebel groups in the country
at present time. The Moro Islamic Liberation Front, the largest
group amid the three, had signed a comprehensive ceasefire
agreement with the government.

<HEADLINE> Guangxi to Build Five Economic Zones </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANNING, November 17 (Xinhua) -- Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous
Region, a multi-ethnic area in south China, is preparing to build
five economic zones, each with its own unique features.
</P>
<P>
An economic zone catering to port transport, marine and
high-tech development will be built on the coastal area in
southern Guangxi, Cao Bochun, secretary of the Autonomous Regional
Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC), announced at a
regional meeting held here recently.
</P>
<P>
The central part of Guangxi will build an economic zone
centering around industrial production.
</P>
<P>
The zone in the region's northern part will emphasize tourism,
agriculture and industry.
</P>
<P>
In the eastern part, rural industry and export-oriented economy
will be featured.
</P>
<P>
Western Guangxi will pay special attention to cultivation and
mining.
</P>
<P>
Formation of a diversified economy is an inevitable trend in
accelerating the regional economy, Cao said.
</P>
<P>
Guangxi is endowed with many superior qualities compared with
other parts of China. It is a communications link between southern
and southwestern China and is rich in sub-tropical and undergrand
resources.
</P>
<P>
So far, governments in the autonomous region have worked out
measures to develop key industries and enhance regional
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Beihai, a city on the northern coast, is speeding up the third
phase of its port construction and the building of an
expressway. Fangcheng port plans to raise its annual handling
capacity above 12 million tons. The city of Nanning, the
autonomous region's capital, is boosting border trade with Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
Liuzhou Prefecture in central Guangxi will readjust assets of
state-owned enterprises and build a multi-lateral investment
system.
</P>
<P>
Baise Prefecture in the west will accelerate economic growth
along the Nanning-Kunming Railway and shift its emphasis to the
processing industry.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Yulin and Wuzhou, cities in the eastern part, will
introduce funds, technology and expertise, as well as qualified
personnel to promote development at foreign-funded and
township-run firms.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh to Survey Shallow Water of Coastal Zone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, November 17 (Xinhua) -- The Geological Survey of
Bangladesh (GSB) in collaboration with the German Geological
Survey (GGS) has undertaken geological survey of the shallow water
area of the country for long term development of the coastal zone,
the GSB sources said here today.
</P>
<P>
To be run over twenty days with financial support from the
German Ministry of Science, Technology and Education, the survey
will determine the flux of sand and mud from the delta into the
sea, especially into the shallow submarine areas of the shelf,
study cyclones, investigate the record of cyclones in the deposits
of the shelf and determine the subsidence of the shelf and coastal
area since 20,000 years ago, according to GSB's Deputy Director
General Abdullah Monwar.
</P>
<P>
A German research vessel, "Sonne", arrived in the harbor of
Chittagong Saturday for taking part in the geological survey, the
sources said.
</P>
<P>
The sand and mud, which have been deposited in the shallow
submarine areas, especially in water depths from 20 to 80 meters,
have bypassed the coastal zone and are therefore not supporting
the growth of coastal islands, the sources noted, adding that the
sand and mud bypassing the shelf into the deep by of Bengal (Bay)
are completely lost for any land accretion.
</P>
<P>
The survey project is focused on mapping the submarine
depositional areas and on measuring how much material is dumped in
these areas, according to the sources.
</P>
<P>
It will also compile a long term record for the cyclones
affecting the coast of Bangladesh providing data to analyze trends
in the frequency of cyclones and how they are related to long term
climatic chances of El Nino events, the sources added.
</P>
<P>
Five scientists from various institutions and Bangladesh Navy
are participating in the survey cruise and later in the evaluation
of the data.
</P>
<P>
The results of the survey and of the previous similar pilot
project in 1994, the sources said, will be discussed during a
seminar in 1998 involving all institutions which study the coastal
zone of Bangladesh.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia, China Sign New MOU on Civil Aviation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, November 17 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia and the People's
Republic of China signed here today a Memorandum of Understanding
(MOU) providing for an enhanced air services arrangement between
the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The new MOU provides among others a multiple airline
designation clause allowing either country to designate any number
of airlines to operate services between Malaysia and China
beginning in 1998 until 2005.
</P>
<P>
Both sides agreed in the MOU to increase passenger frequencies
on a phased basis during the period and to increase cargo services
for the designated airlines of both countries.
</P>
<P>
According to the MOU, signed by Malaysian Transport Minister
Ling Liong Sik and Chinese Minister of General Administration of
Civil Aviation Chen Guangyi on behalf of their respective
governments, landing sites in Malaysia for airlines of China will
increase from the present two -- Kuala Lumpur and Pulau Pinang --
to three with the third one to be chosen while landing sites in
China for airlines of Malaysia will increase from the present
three -- Beijing, Guangzhou and Shanghai -- to six with the other
three -- Xiamen, Kunming and Shenzhen -- chosen already.
</P>
<P>
Both Ling and Chen told reporters after the signing that the
MOU underscores the common will and desire of the two countries to
further strengthen bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
They said the MOU heralds a new chapter in the aviation
relationship and will create new opportunities for the further
development of air links and airline cooperation between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
They believed that with the new MOU, exchanges between the
peoples, trade and tourism would be further promoted to bring
about greater economic benefits to both sides.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia and China established aviation relationship in 1988
when the two countries signed their air services agreement.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese minister arrived here last night for a three-day
visit to Malaysia.

<P>
NEW DELHI, November 17 (Xinhua) -- Indian Finance Minister P.
Chidambaram has for the first time admitted that the instability
of the present United Front government may be the cause of the
steady slowdown in the country's industrial growth.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the state television Doordarshan to be
telecast later today, Chidambaram blamed the Indian industry for
failure to capitalize on the government's incentives for reviving
growth.
</P>
<P>
A finance minister can only do four things -- bringing down the
interest rates, providing more funds to banks by cutting the
reserve ratios, providing enough foreign exchange for any imports,
and bringing the inflation down, he said.
</P>
<P>
Normally all this should spur growth, he said, suggesting that
the measures taken by the government have so far failed to
accelerate growth.
</P>
<P>
The 13-party United Front formed a minority coalition
government in June last year with outside support from the

<HEADLINE> Nepali PM Thapa Elected Chairman of RPP </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, November 17 (Xinhua) -- Prime Minister Surya Bahadur
Thapa of Nepal was again elected Chairman of the National
Democratic Party (RPP) on Sunday in the absence of his arch rival
former Prime Minister Lokendra Bahadur Chand, Radio Nepal reported
today.
</P>
<P>
At the end of the second general convention of the RPP in
Birgunj, about 120 km southwest of Kathmandu, Thapa garnered a
majority of 818 votes, while his rival Rajeshwor Devkota, the
party's former co-chairman, received only 391 votes.
</P>
<P>
The convention also amended the party's statute by establishing
a 41-member executive committee headed by the party chairman,
putting an end to the tradition of collective leadership.
</P>
<P>
Lokendra Bahadur Chand, the RPP's former parliamentary party
leader, boycotted the convention, alleging that Thapa had
dissolved the party's elected organizations in at least 10
districts and packed them with his own supporters.
</P>
<P>
Chand was voted out of power in early October by the Nepali
Congress (NC) with a no-confidence motion after Thapa sided with
the NC.
</P>
<P>
The RPP (Thapa) and the RPP (Chand) merged in early 1992, but
they have never stopped in-fighting.
</P>
<P>
The NC and the Communist Party of Nepal (United
Marxist-Leninist, CPN-UML), the two main parties in parliament,
have taken advantage of the RPP's division for a new political
equation in the past years, making the RPP, the third largest
party in parliament, a weight in the political balance of Nepal.
</P>
<P>
It is widely believed that the NC will join the RPP-led
coalition government after the RPP convention.

<HEADLINE> Indian Gems Are Not Radioactive: Scientist </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, November 17 (Xinhua) -- An Indian scientist, who has
done pioneering work on irradiation of gemstones, refuted the
charge by western countries that gems exported from India were
radioactive, the local press said today.
</P>
<P>
Nataraja Sarma, formerly with India's Bhabha Atomic Research
Center (BARC), said there was "no truth in such wild allegations
and nothing is done in this country that resulted in gemstones
becoming radioactive."
</P>
<P>
He said that before his retirement from BARC, he had worked to
produce "rare and expensive black diamond" through "neutron
irradiation" process on an experimental basis but the project was
subsequently shot down by the BARC top brass.
</P>
<P>
Under the "neutron irradiation" process, ordinary diamond is
put in a nuclear reactor to achieve black diamond, a rare and
precious commodity.
</P>
<P>
Diamond is a form of carbon, there is no way it could turn
radioactive after irradiation, he said.
</P>
<P>
But it has been found in similar research in western countries
that when impure diamond is used for irradiation, the metallic
impurities in diamond get irradiated and hence care needs to be
taken that there is no impurity in the diamond that is being
irradiated, he said.
</P>
<P>
There are two other methods through which other precious and
semi-precious gemstones are irradiated for getting higher value
gemstones, Sarma said, but adding that both of them do not result
in irradiated gemstones becoming radioactive.
</P>
<P>
Gemstones are a major item of India's export basket.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Paddy Production to Drop </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, November 17 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's paddy production
this year is expected to drop by 3.85 percent to 49.13 million
tons from 51.10 million tons last year, the Central Bureau of
Statistics (BPS) predicts.
</P>
<P>
According to a BPS estimate released Sunday, the expected
decline of paddy production is mainly due to the shrinking areas
of paddy farmland, which is estimated at 11.04 million hectares
this year, down by 4.65 percent from last year.
</P>
<P>
Sumatra Island is likely to record a 7.17 percent fall in paddy
output, followed by Sulawesi and Kalimantan with decreases of 7.14
percent and 5.81 percent respectively, it said.

The BPS also said the country's total output of corn is
expected to decline by 1.34 percent to 9.18 million tons this
year.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Minister of Agriculture Sjarifudin Baharsjah said
Indonesia's production of unhusked rice would drop by 4 percent in
1997 compared with 1996 because of a prolonged dry season.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia, formerly the biggest rice importer in the world,
became self-sufficient in rice supply in 1984. However, it began
to import rice again in 1991 due to the shrinking paddy areas and
bad weather conditions.

<HEADLINE> Singapore Revises Upwards 1997 GDP Forecast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, November 17 (Xinhua) -- The Singapore government has
revised its 1997 gross domestic product (GDP) forecast a bit
higher from the original 6-7 percent to around 7 percent, the
Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) said today.
</P>
<P>
In an economic survey for the third quarter of 1997, the
ministry said the country's economy grew by a healthy 7.5 percent
in the first three quarters of this year, as it continued to pick
up in the third quarter after bottoming out in the second half of
last year.
</P>
<P>
"The outlook for the rest of the year remains healthy, with
some moderation in growth in 1998," it said.
</P>
<P>
The ministry noted that the prospects for the external
environment are mixed and the regional economies are expected to
slow down as a result of the recent financial crisis. However,
healthy growth in industrial economies, except for Japan, and the
sustained global electronics recovery would underpin external
demand over the rest of 1997 and 1998, it said.
</P>
<P>
Domestically, the ministry said, overall economic growth in
1997 "is expected to be healthy given the strong momentum in the
first nine months."
</P>
<P>
"Taking all these factors into consideration, the MTI is
revising its 1997 GDP forecast from 6-7 percent to around 7
percent. Going into 1998, some moderation of growth can be
expected as regional growth slows down further. The MTI's
preliminary 1998 GDP forecast is 5-7 percent," it said.

<HEADLINE> South Korean Construction Companies Thrive Overseas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, November 17 (Xinhua) -- South Korean construction
companies are thriving overseas, enjoying the greatest boom since
the late 1970s when demand was record high in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
Statistics of the Korean International Contractors Association
(KICA) show that by November 16 domestic builders received orders
amounting to 10.73 billion U.S. dollars from abroad, just 50
million dollars less than the 10.78 billion dollars of the entire
1996.
</P>
<P>
With that in mind, KICA officials said, this year's total
volume of orders is predicted to approach 16 billion dollars,
surely exceeding the initially-set target of 12 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Given that some projected overseas contracts are virtually in
the bag, the possibility is running high that a new record in
volume of overseas construction orders might be established this
year, they said.
</P>
<P>
The previous record was 13.7 billion dollars set in 1981,
mainly boosted by high demand in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
The officials attributed this year's good performance to South
Korean companies' continued efforts to change business patterns
and expand markets through advancing to markets that had
traditionally been paid less attention to.
</P>
<P>
South Korean companies, instead of resorting to past practices
of basic participation in bids through invitation by foreign
governments or firms placing orders, have increasingly put more
energy into BOT (build, operate, transfer) projects in developing
countries facing lack of capital, and other similar type of
projects.
</P>
<P>
Topping the list of companies, Hyundai Engineering &AMP;
Construction received the largest amount of orders worth 3.49
billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Next came Daewoo Corp. with 2.61 billion dollars, followed by
Samsung Corp. with 820 million dollars and Ssangyong Engineering &AMP;
Construction Co. with 720 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Overseas construction orders, which had been decreasing since
the early 1980s to 2.8 billion dollars in 1992, have been on the
rapid rise in recent years since 1993.
</P>
<P>
According to KICA, the total was 5.1 billion dollars in 1993,
7.4 billion dollars in 1994, 8.5 billion dollars in 1995 and 10.78
billion dollars in 1996.

<HEADLINE> Singapore Economy Grows 10.1 Pct in Third Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, November 17 (Xinhua) -- Singapore's economy
continued to pick up in the third quarter of this year, expanding
by a robust 10.1 percent, further up from 8.2 percent in the
second quarter, the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) said
today.
</P>
<P>
"The favorable performance was characterized by faster growth
in all sectors," the ministry said in an economic survey.
</P>
<P>
"The strong growth indicates that the real economy was not
significantly affected by the regional financial turmoil, though
there was some impact on the volume of re-exports and visitor
arrivals from selected regional economies," it said.
</P>
<P>
The Singapore economy has been cushioned by two main factors,
the ministry explained. First, a large part of Singapore's
regional trade consists of intra-firm movement of parts,
components and final products by Multi-National Corporations
(MNCs). As final demand from the United States and the European
Union remained strong, Singapore's trade was not seriously
affected by the regional currency crisis.
</P>
<P>
Secondly, it said, a healthy recovery in global electronics
demand supported manufacturing growth, with its favorable spin-off
effects on trade and hub services.
</P>
<P>
However, the ministry noted that there was also a low base
effect, as the economy expanded by only 3.3 percent in the
corresponding period of last year.
</P>
<P>
According to the survey, manufacturing output continued to
recover in the third quarter of this year, growing by a robust 9.5
percent, substantially stronger than the 3.5 percent a quarter
earlier.
</P>
<P>
The construction sector expanded by 13 percent, due to higher
public and private-sector residential activity and public civil
engineering works, helped by dry weather during the three-month
period.
</P>
<P>
The commerce sector increased by 8.6 percent in the third
quarter, up from the eight percent level a quarter earlier. Growth
was largely supported by higher retail activity on account of the
Great Singapore Sale and Singapore Food Festival.
</P>
<P>
In financial services, the ministry said, the regional currency
crisis and uncertainty over the merging of the local and foreign
tranches of some listed companies boosted stock market turnover,
while foreign exchange activity moderated somewhat in the third
quarter as traders remained cautious.
</P>
<P>
Overall, the financial and business services sector rose by 12
percent in the third quarter, largely unchanged from the 11
percent growth a quarter earlier.

<HEADLINE> APEC to be urged to push business cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, November 17 (Xinhua) -- The private sector in Asia
Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) economies will urge APEC
leaders to focus on business cooperation in the region,
particularly cross-border trade and investment, a leading Thai
business representative said.
</P>
<P>
The APEC Business Advisory Council (ABAC) will raise issues
concerned at a meeting between its representatives and APEC
ministers in Vancouver, Canada on November 23, one day before an
APEC leadership's informal conference begins in the same city,
said Vachara Phanchet, executive director of the Thai Chamber of
Commerce.
</P>
<P>
The ABAC, which comprises private sector representatives from
APEC members, will urge APEC leaders to relax visa regulations
concerning business trips throughout the region, including the
extension of visa for businessmen, today's local press reports
quoted Vachara as saying.
</P>
<P>
The ABAC will also urge the 18 APEC members to establish a
customs harmonization system regionwide and a common standard for
doing business, said Vachara, who will attend the ABAC meeting
together with other Thai private sector representatives.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the ABAC will seek APEC ministers' support to speed
up the process of liberalization in investment to allow more
involvement of the private sector in the area, particularly in
infrastructure investment, he said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the ABAC will push for an APEC information and
education initiative to allow small- and medium-sized enterprises
to get up-to-date information on the world market, Vachara said.
</P>
<P>
He said that some 80 percent of Thailand's manufacturing
enterprises are small or medium-sized and the plan will help
Thailand to strengthen its manufacturing sector.

<HEADLINE> People's Daily hails Chinese Premier's Japan Visit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 17 (Xinhua) -- China's "People's Daily" in an
editorial today hailed the just-ended visit to Japan by Chinese
Premier Li Peng as a complete success, calling for promotion of
Sino-Japanese friendship and cooperation from generation to
generation.
</P>
<P>
At the invitation of the Japanese government, Premier Li Peng
paid an official good-will visit to Japan from November 11 to 16,
and was accorded warm welcome and hospitality by the Japanese
government, the opposition and personages of various circles, the
editorial said.
</P>
<P>
This is the first visit by a head of the Chinese government to
Japan in eight years.
</P>
<P>
During the visit, Premier Li Peng and Japanese Prime Minister
Ryutaro Hashimoto held cordial and frank talks on bilateral
relations and international and regional issues of common concern,
and reached common understanding in a broad way.
</P>
<P>
Through frequent contacts Li Peng made many friends with
Japanese statesmen, businessmen and people from Japan-China
friendship organizations.
</P>
<P>
"The visit has attained the goal of deepening understanding,
enhancing friendship and strengthening cooperation, which will
produce a far-reaching influence on the consolidation and further
development of China-Japan relations," the editorial said.
</P>
<P>
This year marks the 25th anniversary of the normalization of
diplomatic relations between China and Japan. The Sino-Japanese
ties are standing at a crucial point which links the past with the
future, it said.
</P>
<P>
Both the Chinese and Japanese leaders stressed the need to
usher the sound and stable China-Japan relations into the 21st
century and to make great efforts to achieve the goal of
generation-to-generation friendship.
</P>
<P>
Li Peng announced at a press conference five basic principles
for the development of China-Japan relations. They are mutual
respect and non-interference in each other's internal affairs;
seeking common ground while reserving differences and properly
handling the differences; increasing dialogues and mutual
understanding; promoting economic cooperation on the basis of
mutual benefit; and looking to the future and fostering
generation-to-generation friendship.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese government put forward the five principles from a
long-term strategic perspective, in accordance with the
Sino-Japanese Joint Statement and the China-Japan Treaty of Peace
and Friendship, and after reviewing the positive and negative
experiences in the development of bilateral ties since the
normalization of diplomatic relations between the two countries 25
years ago," the editorial said.
</P>
<P>
They are important guiding principles in the development of the
China-Japan ties at the current stage and in the long-time future.
</P>
<P>
Expanding and promoting economic, trade, scientific and
technological cooperation between the two countries is one of the
major aims of this tour of Japan by Premier Li Peng, it said.
</P>
<P>
China and Japan signed agreements on fishery and cooperation in
environmental protection, and confirmed the major advancement in
the bilateral negotiations on service trade, which is one aspect
of China's entry into the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
Li also visited a number of well-known enterprises in Japan,
particularly those high-tech industries, getting to know about the
state-of-the-art achievements made by Japan in the field of
science and technology. The Chinese premier also held in-depth
discussions with Japanese businessmen on the new fields, new ways
and new starting points for the promotion of economic cooperation
between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
China, the biggest developing country in the world, and Japan,
one of the most-developed economies in the world, have broad
prospects and great potential in their economic cooperation. China
is a key trading partner for Japan and vice versa. And the two
economies are highly complementary to each other. Li Peng's visit
has given a great impetus to the further economic and
technological cooperation between the two countries, the editorial
added.
</P>
<P>
The development of the bilateral relations in the past 25 years
has proved that strictly abiding by the Sino-Japanese Joint
Declaration and the China-Japan Treaty of Peace and Friendship is
the guarantee of sound and stable development of the relations
between the two countries, it said.
</P>
<P>
The existing problems and those likely to arise in the future
between the two nations should be properly handled through
dialogue and consultations and by seeking common ground while
reserving differences so that they will not become obstacles in
the way of developing bilateral relations, it noted.
</P>
<P>
Both China and Japan are influencial countries in Asia and the
world at large. With the profound changes in the internatioal
situation, and the growing trend of multi-polarization, continuous
consolidation and development of good-neighborly, friendly and
cooperative relations between China and Japan not only conform
with the fundamental interests of the two peoples, but also
benefit peace and prosperity in the Asia-Pacific region and the
world as a whole.
</P>
<P>
As Japan chose a way of peaceful development after World War II
and gained successes in economy, "We hope Japan will learn from
the history and continue to follow the way of peaceful
development. We believe that only properly handling the
orientation of developing the Sino-Japanese relations can the
bilateral ties develop in a sound and stable way," the editorial
concluded.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lankan Army Launches New Phase of Operation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, November 17 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lankan government troops
Sunday morning launched the third phase of their major northern
operation Jaya Sikuru (Certain of Victory) to clear Tamil rebels
from the main highway between the north and the south through
rebel-held areas.
</P>
<P>
According to press reports reaching here today, the troops
recaptured the center of Puliyankulam, one of the major towns on
the highway which was occupied by the rebels.
</P>
<P>
Operation Jaya Sikuru was started on May 13 this year and the
troops had earlier completed two of its phases. The third phase
aims to recapture the remaining stretch of the land route which
runs from the town of Vavuniya to the northern Jaffna peninsula.
</P>
<P>
The troops recaptured the Jaffna peninsula in May last year and
subsequently cleared the route between the south of the peninsula
and the town of Kilinochchi north of Vavuniya.
</P>
<P>
The troops backed by artillery and air cover were moving
towards Kilinochchi, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
The Sri Lankan government is keen to clear the highway of
rebels to ensure a supply route to the north both for military
supplies and essentials for the civilians.
</P>
<P>
For a long time supplies have been transported by air and sea
which has been very costly for the government.
</P>
<P>
The Tamil rebels have been fighting a 14-year war against the
government for a separate state in the north and east of the
country.

<HEADLINE> Heavy Drinking, Binge Drinking Surveyed in U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, November 16 (Xinhua) -- Recent studies indicate a
substantial decline in alcoholism among white men in the United
States while binge drinking among college students is still a
serious problem.
</P>
<P>
A University of California at Berkeley study released earlier
this week has found that the portion of white men aging between 18
and 29 who report drinking heavily has dropped by half, from 32
percent down to 16 percent.
</P>
<P>
That was the result of a nationwide survey covering more than
6,000 American men and women who were white, black and Latino. It
is said to be the first large-scale study that compares drinking
rates among different ethnic groups.
</P>
<P>
The decline did not include young black and Latino men. The
study found that 18 percent of young black and 17 percent of
Latino men were frequent heavy drinkers.
</P>
<P>
"Heavy drinking" is defined as taking five or more drinks in
one sitting at least once a week.
</P>
<P>
Heavy drinking among white men used to peak in their 20s, 30s
and then decline. The study suggests that young, white American
men have broken a pattern of heavy drinking that had persisted in
a significant portion of that population for a generation.
</P>
<P>
Although rates of heavy drinking have declined among young
white men, the study found that the level of "alcohol-related
problems" remains the same. The problems include belligerence,
accidents and problems with police, spouse or the workplace.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a recent study by the Harvard School of Public
Health found that binge drinking on college campuses has been on
the rise.
</P>
<P>
With data collected from a national sample of nearly 17,600
students at 140 four-year colleges and universities, the Harvard
survey on college drinking is said to provide a complete portrait
of student drinking behavior.
</P>
<P>
"Binge drinking" for men is defined as having five or more
drinks in a row, and for women as having four or more drinks in a
row.
</P>
<P>
The study shows 44 percent of U.S. college students engage in
binge drinking, and at almost one-third of the colleges more than
half of the students were binge drinkers.
</P>
<P>
The overall rate among men is 50 percent and among women, 39
percent. About half the binge drinkers, or about one in five
students overall, were frequent binge drinkers.
</P>
<P>
"The current level of binge drinking by U.S. college students
is a serious problem," the study concluded. The problem not only
interferes with the mission of higher education, but also carries
with it serious risks of disease, injury and death, it said.
</P>
<P>
The study group urged school administration to consider such
measures as establishing a policy of "zero tolerance" for
alcohol-related violence, regulating the conditions of alcohol use
on campus, and eliminating sponsorship of events by the alcohol
industry and other on-campus marketing.

<HEADLINE> Thai Shrimp Exports Drop on Higher EU Tariffs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, November 17 (Xinhua) -- Shrimp exports, one of
Thailand's top foreign exchange earners, have declined since the
European Union (EU) imposed higher tariffs under its new general
system of preference (GSP) on January 1, according to an industry
survey available today.
</P>
<P>
Thailand's shrimp exports in the first seven months of this
year dropped by 8 percent to 76,413 tons compared with 83,122 tons
in the same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
Shrimp exports to the EU registered the biggest drop of 19
percent from 8,786 tons to 7,144 tons, a result of higher import
duty on Thai shrimp products.
</P>
<P>
Before January 1, Thai products were levied by a 4.5 percent
import duty, the same rate applied to shrimp products from
Malaysia, Indonesia, India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka and China.
</P>
<P>
Under the new rate of 9.7 percent, Thai shrimp products have
become less competitive than those from the above countries which
are levied at 5.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
Thai exporters are arguing against an evaluation by the
European Commission which considers Thailand to be better off than
Malaysia. Thailand's per capita income is 2,680 U.S. dollars
against Malaysia's 3,930 dollars.
</P>
<P>
The Thai Frozen Foods Association recently asked the Thai
Commerce Ministry to negotiate with the EU for restoration of the
4.5 percent rate on a fixed quota of Thai shrimp imports.
</P>
<P>
Thai shrimp exports worldwide totaled 161,486 tons last year.

<HEADLINE> Singapore Trade Robust in Third Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, November 17 (Xinhua) -- Singapore's total trade rose
by 13 percent in the third quarter of this year, the Ministry of
Trade and Industry said today.
</P>
<P>
In value terms, the country's total trade increased by 12
percent to reach a record high of 99.3 billion Singapore dollars
(63.25 billion U.S. dollars), the ministry said in an economic
survey.
</P>
<P>
The key contributor to the robust trade performance was the
sustained electronics recovery, supported by strong demand from
major markets like the United States and the European Union, the
ministry said.
</P>
<P>
This provided a buffer to the lower demand from Japan which was
suffering from poor domestic economic conditions, the ministry
noted.
</P>
<P>
During the three-month period, total exports increased by 8.8
percent to reach 47.8 billion Singapore dollars (30.45 billion US
dollars). Domestic exports grew by 7.6 percent while re-exports
rose by 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
In addition, with the recovery in global electronics demand, in
particular from the major markets such as the United States and
the European Union, non-oil domestic exports expanded by 9.4
percent to 23.6 billion Singapore dollars (15 billion U.S.
dollars) in the third quarter, up from the moderate increase of
4.4 percent in the previous quarter.
</P>
<P>
While its trade grew strongly, Singapore's current account
surplus fell to 5.3 billion Singapore dollars (3.38 billion US
dollars) in the third quarter of this year, compared with 6.2
billion Singapore dollars (4.19 billion US dollars) in the
previous quarter, the ministry said.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Singapore recorded a larger balance of payments
surplus of 2.9 billion Singapore dollars (1.85 billion US dollars)
during the third quarter, compared with 1.7 billion Singapore
dollars (1.15 billion US dollars) in the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
The ministry said that the higher balance of payments surplus
was largely due to stronger capital inflows. Net capital inflows
rose to 4.2 billion Singapore dollars (2.68 billion US dollars) in
the third quarter, up from 1.4 billion Singapore dollars (945.95
million US dollars) in the second quarter.

<HEADLINE> Peres Optimistic About Middle East Situation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, November 16 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Labor Party's leader
Shimon Peres said today that he is optimistic about the Middle
East situation.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in Pistoia, northwest of Rome, Peres said though
severe crisis occurred in the Middle East, no one is talking about
war except extremists in Israel and Arab countries.
</P>
<P>
"We can only assess the situation from people's feelings in
different countries," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Arab countries are entering a stage of economic development,
including those in north Africa. Under such circumstances, no one
is willing to indulge in war," he said.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the tough policy of the Israeli government, he
said the policy would do no good to Israel, because this would
arouse intense reaction from Arab countries. "But I regret that
Israel will not change its policy within a short period," he said.

<P>
SHANTOU, November 17 (Xinhua) -- The private economy in
Shantou, a special economic zone in south China's Guangdong
province, has witnessed an annual growth rate of over 25 percent
in recent years, with the sector emerging as an economic pillar in
the city.
</P>
<P>
The city's over 60,000 private enterprises employ over 400,000
people. Five private Shantou enterprises have total fixed assests
of over 100 million yuan (12.5 million US dollars) each.
</P>
<P>
Shantou's private enterprises had a total 1996 industrial
output value of 40 billion yuan and export volume of 1.1 billion
US dollars, with profits and taxes surpassing one billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Profitable private enterprises in the city have not only
established branches in the United States, Thailand, Singapore and
Hong Kong, but have also expanded their presence in the domestic
market.
</P>
<P>
The city's private enterprises invested some 500 million yuan
in technological renovation projects during 1996, with well over
70 percent of the investments used for the development of new
technology and products.
</P>
<P>
In 1996 alone, private enterprises contributed more than 120
million yuan to public welfare programs and 60 million yuan to
help farmers escape poverty.

<HEADLINE> Highway Traffic Accidents Kill 30 Italians </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, November 16 (Xinhua) -- Dozens of highway traffic
accidents over the weekend killed a total of 30 Italians and
injured some one hundred, Italy's state television station said in
today's evening news reports.
</P>
<P>
The past weekend saw the country's most serious traffic tragedy
in recent months, the TV station said.
</P>
<P>
It added that among those injured to death, most were young
people aging between 18- to 35-year-old, including the 1996
Olympic silver medal winner Andrea Masucci, 23.
</P>
<P>
The TV station quoted the police as saying that most of the
accidents were results of high-speed driving, especially when
turning corners.
</P>
<P>
It urged the departments concerned to map out more strict
measures so as to make sure that the drivers will drive within the
speed limit.
</P>
<P>
In late 1980s, the Italian traffic authorities set 130
kilometers per hour as the highway speed limit, but few drivers,
especially young people, in 1990s would observe the limit. They
prefer a dangerous driving speed over 180 kilometers per hour.

<HEADLINE> Surgery Restores Eyesight of Gorilla </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHENGZHOU, November 17 (Xinhua) -- Veterinarians and eye
surgeons have successfully transplanted an artifical cornea to
restore the vision of a male gorilla.
</P>
<P>
This was the first such operation on a gorilla in China. In
addition to the gorilla in Zhengzhou Zoo named Nikou, the only
other such primates in captivity are his parents in the Beijing
zoo.
</P>
<P>
Nikou, a 15-year-old gorilla weighing about 100 kilograms
(220.5 pounds), began losing his eyesight several months ago
because of cataracts.
</P>
<P>
"It couldn't walk and climb as freely as before, and even
became fairly depressed due to the illness," said zoo keeper Han
Huaien.
</P>
<P>
The zoo invited doctors with the Henan Provincial Hospital and
two veterinarians from the Beijing Zoo to examine the primate,
beloved by locals as much as the giant pandas.
</P>
<P>
"It's very difficult to anesthetize Nikou because you can't
expect it to cooperate with us like humans," said anesthetist Zhu
Pingzeng, referring to Friday's operation for the primate.
</P>
<P>
Twelve zoo keepers performed 24-hour care for the gorilla after
the operation to prevent it from pulling at the bandages.
</P>
<P>
"We'll wait to see how the right eye recovers, and then decide
when to conduct the operation on the left eye," Dr. Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
Nikou is the only gorilla born in China since its mother became
sterile after his birth in the Beijing Zoo in 1982.
</P>
<P>
Nikou's parents were presented to China by the King of Spain in
the 1970s.

<HEADLINE> Italian Coach Looking to World Cup Finals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAPLES, Italy, November 16 (Xinhua) -- After beating Russia
last night 1-0 before a passionate crowd of around 80,000 fans
crammed into the San Paolo Stadium here, Italy has heaved a huge
sigh of relief and is now looking forward to the 1998 World Cup
finals as other teams seek to qualify on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
As one paper wrote, Gigi Casiraghi's goal eight minutes into
the second half spelled "the end of a nightmare".
</P>
<P>
It will be the 14th time that Italy goes to the World Cup
finals (winning the championship in 1934, 1938 and 1982).
</P>
<P>
Sportswriters reminded their readers that a final score of 0-0
would have been enough to send the Italian national soccer team to
France for the World Cup but that last night's game was
touch-and-go virtually up until the start of the second half.
</P>
<P>
Italy's honor has been saved but many felt that despite valid
players, the team too often finds itself improvising on the
field. Likewise, the Italians cannot go to the World Cup with the
only aim being that of not letting the other guys score, Pistilli
cautioned.
</P>
<P>
Now that Maldini the pragmatist had made sure his team has
qualified, the 65-year-old coach has promised to experiment more,
modifying tactics and using new players as Italy takes on the
world.
</P>
<P>
Cesare Maldini, team coach and father of its captain, Paolo
Maldini, said today he would like to see several friendlies
organized to give the team added experience playing together.
</P>
<P>
In fact, a first friendly will be played in January between
11-25 and a second in either March or April. He is hoping for a
third closer to the World Cup, possibly around June 1st.
</P>
<P>
The Italians will probably be playing teams from those nations
which did not qualify for the World Cup finals, thus the circle
narrows down to Sweden, Portugal, the Czech Republic, Switzerland,
Ireland and Greece.
</P>
<P>
But if Maldini would like to test his players against
opponents from other continents, he could consider nations which
have already qualified, for example, one of the emerging teams
from Africa. This could entail traveling to Morocco for a game,
for example.
</P>
<P>
In response to criticisms that the games are not spectacular
enough, Maldini said the players were often too keyed up but he
snorted at those who suggested a psychologist be hired to help the
team handle the tension.
</P>
<P>
The idea of hiring an assistant coach has been categorically
ruled out too. The only concession Maldini is willing to make in
terms of bolstering his staff is to perhaps add an athletic
trainer.

KINGSTON, Jamaica, November 16 (Xinhua) -- Jamaica booked a
place in the World Cup finals Sunday as a 0-0 tie with Mexico was
enough for their qualification for the '98 France.
</P>
<P>
Alongside with the United States and Mexico, Jamaica is the
only Caribbean team who claimed a spot in the tournament in the
past 24 years.
</P>
<P>
With Mexico already qualifying and El Salvador needing a win
over the United States and Jamaica's lose, the goalless match was
more like a friendly, as both sides made little efforts for
scoring.
</P>
<P>
Mexican keeper Osvaldo Sanchez stopped a free kick at the 15th
minute and dispersed Linval Dixon's drive one minute later, while
Mexico's best chance came as Luis Garcia's shot barely deflected
in the 55 minutes.
</P>
<P>
In Sunday's other World Cup qualifying matches, Japan beat
Iran 3-2 with a golden goal in the extra time and Chile upset
Bolivia 3-0 to earn a spot in finals.

Two-game home-and-away playoffs between Iran and Australian
will complete the 32-team list for the world soccer premier
showcase next year.

<HEADLINE> Animal Husbandry Industry in Northeast China Provinces Booming </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGCHUN, November 17 (Xinhua) -- Three northeast China
provinces, known as China's grain warehouse, have emerged as new
production centers for animal husbandry.
</P>
<P>
The three provinces -- Liaoning, Jilin and Heilongjiang -- lead
the country in the output of meat, eggs and milk. In the first
half of this year, the three provinces' combined meat output was
three million tons, a record high.
</P>
<P>
Two million hogs from this region were sent to markets in other
provinces during the first six months.
</P>
<P>
Northeastern areas have been important for commercial grain
production and heavy industry in China. Liaoning, Jilin and
Heilongjiang reported 16.6 million tons, 23.2 million tons and
30.4 million tons in 1996 in grain output, respectively. They
accounted for a major part of China's total marketable grain.
</P>
<P>
However, the economy in this region still lags behind provinces
on the eastern coast of China.
</P>
<P>
The three provinces in recent years have committed to
developing their animal husbandry industry, while relying on their
successful grain production.
</P>
<P>
Liaoning province had 2.25 million tons in meat output last
year. Annual per-capita meat consumption topped 62 kilograms,
higher than the national average.
</P>
<P>
In addition, animal husbandry has become a key industry in
Jilin Province, accounting for one-third of the province's
agricultural output. Heilongjiang province is developing its
animal husbandry by adopting high-tech breeding techniques.
</P>
<P>
Officials said the growing animal husbandry industry in
northeast China has already attracted overseas investors, mainly
from the United States, New Zealand, Thailand and Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Products generated by joint ventures here have exported to
markets in Southeast Asia, Africa and the European
Community.

<HEADLINE> College Teachers Urged to Earn Higher Academic Degrees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 17 (Xinhua) -- The State Education Commission
(SEC) is drafting a regulation to require college and university
teachers to earn higher academic degrees, in a bid to further
improve teaching efficiency.
</P>
<P>
The regulation stipulates that by the year 2000, approximately
60 percent of teachers in leading universities should have a
master's degree, while about 15 percent will reach doctorate
levels, according to today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
"The rest are required to have at least a bachelor's degree,"
Yang Chunmao, an official of the Teacher Affairs Department of the
SEC, was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
For non-leading universities and colleges, the teachers with
doctorate and master's degrees will make up half of the teaching
staff, while the rest ought to have bachelor's degrees, according
to the regulation.
</P>
<P>
"The academic degrees of teachers in colleges and universities
in China are lower compared to developed countries," Yang said.
</P>
<P>
Statistics showed that among the 400,000 college and university
teachers, only 12,000 have doctorate degrees, 26 percent have
master's degree, and the rest have bachelor's degree.
</P>
<P>
Key universities have already set higher standards for teachers
involving teaching and research programs. Taking Beijing
University for example, nearly 60 percent of teachers have
master's and doctorate degrees. In Qinghua University, about 72
percent of teachers have doctorate or master's degrees.
</P>
<P>
The SEC implemented a set of regulations for teachers'
qualifications in 1995, aiming to upgrade teachers' qualifications
in all grades of schools ranging from kindergarten to college and
university.

to address the problem of implementing U.N. resolutions through
dialogue while stressing that Iraq would not accept any other
solutions to the current crisis, according to Iraqi News Agency.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi leader expressed his satisfaction to the stance of
the international community and the Arab world in particular
towards the standoff between the U.S. and Iraq. He urged all
parties concerned to take the same stand on the issue and seek a
political solution to the crisis.
</P>
<P>
He said that Iraq is confident that the international community
would sympathize with Iraq in dealing with the U.N. special
commission on dismantling of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq
when more facts of the issue are clarified.
</P>
<P>
The cabinet meeting also discussed matters of international
reactions on the current crisis and preparations made by different
departments for a possible U.S. strike on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The showdown between the U.S. and Iraq was triggered by the
expulsion of six U.S. arms inspectors on the U.N. teams of
disarmament in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
A U.N. resolution last Wednesday condemned the Iraqi move and
called for unconditional implementation of all related
U.N. resolutions by Iraq and demanded Iraq back down its decision of
expelling U.S. members of the U.N. mission in Iraq. The United
States and Britain have threatened to use force against Iraq and
their two aircraft carriers are on the way to the Gulf for the
purpose.

<HEADLINE> Britain's Brown to Oppose Plans for New Euro Club </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 16 (Xinhua) -- British Chancellor of the
Exchequer Gordon Brown is to oppose a Franco-German proposal to
set up an inner circle of countries to plan the single European
currency at Monday's European Union (EU) finance ministers meeting
in Brussels.
</P>
<P>
Local media reports today said that Paris and Bonn want only
the countries which sign up for the European economic and monetary
union (EMU) at the start of 1999 to be part of the "Euro club."
</P>
<P>
The inner circle of EU ministers will meet for talks ahead of
the regular EU finance ministers' meeting.
</P>
<P>
However, Brown is expected to reject such a proposal because
the single currency is of "direct concern to all."
</P>
<P>
Britain, which has effectively ruled out participation in the
planned single currency for the next five years, insists that the
only decision-making body should continue to be the meeting of EU
finance ministers, or the Ecofin, said a Treasury official.
</P>
<P>
"Ecofin is the main forum for discussion of economic policies,
and the UK sees that as the continued way forward," the official
added.
