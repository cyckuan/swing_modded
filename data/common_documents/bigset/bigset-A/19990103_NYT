<P>
   IRVING _ As the final minutes of Saturday's NFC ild-card game
were winding down, an irate Deion Sanders challenged his Dallas
teammates: ``How are you going to feel in the morning?''
</P>
<P>
   This hangover should rival even the worst one from New Year's
Day.
</P>
<P>
   Despite having three Super Bowl rings and having beaten the
Arizona Cardinals 16 of 17 times entering the game, the Cowboys
were vastly overmatched, losing 20-7 and getting eliminated from
the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, by the Cardinals. The team that hadn't won a playoff game
since 1947.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we are supposed to be big-time players and play in big-time
games, then we have to perform in big-time games,'' said Sanders,
who returned to play after missing five starts because of a
sprained toe. ``I think a lot of people were thinking about the
next game. To lose like this was crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys weren't supposed to lose to Arizona. After all, they
already had beaten the Cardinals twice this season, scoring 73
points in the two games. And the Cardinals hadn't been in the
playoffs in a non-strike year since 1975.
</P>
<P>
   They were supposed to be awed by Texas Stadium and the Cowboys'
aura.
</P>
<P>
   They weren't.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't care about the past, only the future,'' Cardinals
coach Vince Tobin said. ``It doesn't matter who was the president
the last time the Cardinals won in the playoffs.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals blanketed the Dallas receivers, resulting in a
22-of-49 passing day for Troy Aikman, who threw three interceptions
and was sacked four times. They limited the Cowboys to 96 yards
rushing and generally frustrated coach Chan Gailey's offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``Offensively, we stunk up the stadium,'' said Cowboys running
back Emmitt Smith, who carried 16 times for 74 yards.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys had six possessions begin at their 37-yard line or
better, but they didn't score until there were only 3 minutes, 33
seconds left in the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got the weapons,'' Smith said. ``I guess we just don't
have the bullets.''
</P>
<P>
   What they were shooting were blanks. Cowboys kicker Richie
Cunningham kicked a 36-yard field-goal attempt wide in the first
quarter. The Cowboys were stuffed on fourth-and-one at the Arizona
seven in the second. They had a third-quarter possession that
included two fumbles and two sacks on three consecutive plays. They
allowed Jamir Miller to come up the middle to pound Aikman for a
loss of 10 yards on fourth-and-one in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   And those were only a few plays that will stand out when they
watch the film in the offseason. There were dropped balls that
became too numerous to count as early as the first half. There were
penalties that eliminated short-yardage situations. And there were
miscommunications that resulted in missed blocks.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you throw the football down the field and it hits
receivers in the chest, I can see how it would get frustrating,''
Smith said. ``We were all getting frustrated.''
</P>
<P>
   It didn't get better. They went into the locker room at halftime
trailing by 10 but could get nothing going in the third quarter.
The Cowboys ran a total of 17 plays on the first five possessions
of the second half, punting three times, throwing one interception
and turning the ball over on downs once. In those five drives, they
moved the ball a net 29 yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told them that we would play well after the first half,''
Gailey said of his halftime locker-room talk. ``I truly believed
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Arizona Pro Bowler Aeneas Williams effectively took Cowboys
receiver Michael Irvin out of the game. Irvin finished with four
catches for 32 yards, the longest an 11-yarder. Williams also
intercepted two passes.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't the Jake Plummer show that some might have expected.
Plummer, who threw for 314 yards in the second half the last time
the teams met, threw for 213 yards and two touchdowns. But it
wasn't the passing yardage or any big plays that stood out.
Instead, the second-year player simply showed poise and
consistency. He completed 19 of 36 passes with two interceptions.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals also mixed in a ground game, adding 133 yards, 95
by Adrian Murrell. Murrell had the longest run ever against Dallas
in the postseason, going straight up the middle for a 74-yarder at
the start of the third quarter. On the next play, Plummer threw a
three-yard pass to fullback Larry Centers in the end zone.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have never run the ball well against Dallas,'' Tobin said.
``That first big run in the second half really helped our game.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys put their only points on the board after Sanders
returned a punt to the Arizona 25. Three passes later, Aikman
connected with Billy Davis for a six-yard touchdown. The Cowboys
were trailing 20-0 at the time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody knew what the hell was going on today,'' Cowboys
offensive lineman Nate Newton said. ``Every football player knows
there are three seasons. We failed in the third one.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   Coach Pat Burns didn't have to put the fear of God into his team
about the dangerous combination of Paul Kariya, Teemu Selanne, and
Steve Rucchin.
</P>
<P>
   All the Bruins had to do was take a look at the summary in
Saturday's paper showing the trio's five goals and seven assists
against the best goalie in hockey _ Buffalo's Dominik Hasek _ in
Friday afternoon's 7-2 Anaheim victory.
</P>
<P>
   After a momentary gulp, the Bruins came up with a plan _ send
speeding wingers P.J. Axelsson and Peter Ferraro out on a makeshift
checking line with big center Joe Thornton. The result was a 2-1
win at the FleetCenter Saturday night, with Anaheim's only goal
coming on a power play late in the second period.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a tough trip where we were giving up a lot of goals,''
said goaltender Byron Dafoe, who had 29 saves after serving as a
backup the last two games. ``Tonight we focused on defense. It was
definitely a test, and we came through.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to playing strong defense, Thornton scored the first
Boston goal on a power play at 8:15 of the second period to give
Boston a 1-0 lead. As tough a time as the Bruins have had scoring
goals recently, it was the defensive side that contributed to their
recent 1-3 road trip. Saturday night the Bruins played with more
discipline against an electrifying combination.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't take your eyes off them because once you do, they're
right behind you and they have a couple steps on you, and once they
have a couple of steps on you, there's no turning back, they're
gone,'' said Ferraro of the Ducks' top line. ``I'm definitely tired
from chasing those guys around.''
</P>
<P>
   For Thornton, who has bounced around from line to line, it was a
fresh challenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``Joe did a good job especially down low,'' said Burns. ``You
don't try to win the faceoffs in your own end, you just try to tie
them up. He did that basically every time.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm usually against the third or fourth lines,'' said
Thornton. ``Tonight was a kind of different role I played. It was
exciting. It's big, him showing confidence in me. When he does
that, and I'm out in the last minute, my confidence definitely
(builds).''
</P>
<P>
   Thornton's goal, scored on a rebound of Ray Bourque's shot,
ended three dubious streaks for Boston. It broke the Bruins'
scoreless skein against the Ducks at 149 minutes 2 seconds. It also
was the first man-advantage goal the Bruins scored against Anaheim
in 31 tries. Their last was Jan. 11, 1996 in Boston. It also ended
a shutout streak for Guy Hebert, who held the Bruins scoreless for
159 minutes 51 seconds before Thornton's score.
</P>
<P>
   The Ducks thought they had tied the game at 11:42 when a
backhander from the slot by Selanne hit the post, hit Dafoe and
then went behind the goalie. Selanne raised his arms in celebration
but video replay officials ruled the puck hadn't completely crossed
the goal line before it was snagged by Dafoe.
</P>
<P>
   That reprieve proved to be short-lived however as the Ducks did
tie it on the power play with 44.2 seconds left in the period.
Kariya dished a pass from the right point to defenseman Fredrik
Olausson. Olausson relayed it to Selanne in the left circle.
Selanne one-timed a blistering shot that Dafoe never had a chance
on.
</P>
<P>
   That set the stage for Heinze's goal at 10:28 of the third.
Heinze, shortly after coming off the bench, scored his 10th of the
year just 29 seconds after the Bruins killed off a penalty to
Bourque. Center Jason Allison dished a pass to Heinze, who skated
through the left circle and down into the crease, beating Hebert.
The Ducks protested, thinking Heinze jumped on the ice too early
but the goal stood.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need Heinzey,'' said Burns. ``We can't hide the fact that
if we don't get any goals from him and if the top line isn't going,
who's going to score? He's a guy who's going to be a a 25-goal
scorer every year and he has to give it to us.''
</P>
<P>
   Less than a minute after the Heinze goal, the Bruins thought
they had bought themselves some breathing room. Sergei Samsonov
fired a forehand shot on Hebert that the goalie stopped. The puck
went off defenseman Kevin Haller's stick and then back to Samsonov,
who fired in a forehander from the crease. It was ruled no goal
because Samsonov was in the crease before the puck. It turned out
the Bruins didn't need it. They managed to fend off Kariya and
company the rest of the way.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're the bread and butter of their lineup,'' said Burns of
Kariya and Selanne. ``If you can shut them down, you have a chance
to win. If you don't, it's difficult. We knew coming off what
happened in Dallas (a 6-1 loss) that we couldn't go out and give
out those same opportunities. This was more of a match for us than
Dallas was.''

 By JOSEPH DUARTE  
 c. 1998, Houston Chronicle  
Despite rumors to the contrary, Nolan Ryan did not invent the
strikeout. He only perfected it.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Appropriately, Ryan on Sept. 11, 1966, struck out the first
major-leaguer he ever faced _ Atlanta Braves pitcher Pat Jarvis _
in his debut with the New York Mets. By the time his two-inning
appearance was complete, Ryan had retired two future Hall of
Famers, getting Eddie Mathews on a strikeout and Henry Aaron on a
foulout to first.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coming from Class A ball into the big leagues and playing
against the Braves it was pretty overwhelming,'' said Ryan, a lanky
19-year-old from Alvin at the time of his debut. ``A lot of guys on
that team were people that it wasn't that many years before I had
baseball cards of.''
</P>
<P>
   From that point, a 27-year path to the Hall of Fame was filled
with more names than the phone directories for some Texas towns.
Cesar Geronimo was Ryan's 3,000th strikeout victim, Danny Heep his
4,000th and Rickey Henderson his 5,000th. In all, Ryan racked up
5,714 K's, a record seemingly safe for eternity.
</P>
<P>
   ``They say you're nobody until you've struck out against Nolan
Ryan,'' said third baseman Travis Fryman, a 21-year-old Detroit
rookie at the time, before a game toward the end of Ryan's career.
</P>
<P>
   Fryman batted twice against Ryan in the game, bouncing out to
third and flying to left.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't strike out,'' Fryman said afterward. ``I guess I'm
still nobody.''
</P>
<P>
   By the time the ``Ryan Express'' retired in 1993 _ at age 46 _
he had amassed 324 victories and a record seven no-hitters while
pitching for the Mets, Angels, Astros and Rangers. Come Tuesday,
Ryan figures to be among the newest electees to baseball's Hall of
Fame.
</P>
<P>
   With Ryan considered a lock, Kansas City third baseman George
Brett is also a favorite to be inducted in his first year of
eligibility. Robin Yount, Carlton Fisk and Dale Murphy are other
first-ballot hopefuls, with Tony Perez, Jim Rice, Tommy John, Gary
Carter and Bruce Sutter among the top holdovers yet to be elected.
To gain Hall enshrinement, candidates must be named on 75 percent
of the ballots turned in by 10-year members of the Baseball
Writers' Association of America.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think for any professional athlete, if they are fortunate
enough to (go into the Hall of Fame), it pretty much wraps up their
career, sums up their career,'' said Ryan, who pitched for the
Astros from 1980-88 and continues to live in Alvin, where he is
involved in ranching.
</P>
<P>
   Did Ryan ever imagine having such a career? Hardly. Early on, he
developed a reputation as a hard thrower who terrorized opposing
hitters with his lack of control. His talent was so raw, he was
passed over until the eighth round of the 1965 free-agent draft,
when the Mets picked him at the behest of scout Red Murff.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I signed (with the Mets), I had no idea whether I had the
talent or the ability to make the big leagues,'' Ryan said. ``Then,
I made it my goal to qualify for the pension. I felt that (playing
four years) was hopefully a realistic goal.''
</P>
<P>
   He almost qualified six times over, lasting an extra 23 seasons.
</P>
<P>
   But Ryan's first victory did not come until April 14, 1968, in
the Astrodome. Paired against the Astros' Larry Dierker, he allowed
three hits, walked two and struck out eight in 6 innings of a 4-2
Mets victory before leaving the game with a blister on his middle
finger.
</P>
<P>
   The next season, Ryan went 6-3 to help the Miracle Mets to the
World Series championship. At the time, he earned $18,000. In 1980,
the Astros would make him the first pro athlete to play for $1
million in a season.
</P>
<P>
   Most of Ryan's best seasons came while with California. In 1972,
he went 19-16 with a 2.28 ERA, leading the American League in
strikeouts (329) and shutouts (nine). The following year, he
finished 21-16 with a 2.87 ERA, breaking Sandy Koufax's
single-season record with 383 strikeouts and tossing two no-hitters
in a two-month span. In 1974, he won a career-high 22 games.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Ryan's four no-hitters in eight seasons with the Angels,
California general manager Buzzie Bavasi labeled him a ``.500
pitcher'' and decided to let him become a free agent at the end of
the 1979 season.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan got his wish of playing closer to home when he signed with
the Astros in 1980. While in Houston, he pitched his fifth
no-hitter and twice led the National League in ERA while helping
the Astros to division titles in 1980 and '86.
</P>
<P>
   During the end of his playing days with the Astros, team doctors
suggested Ryan undergo surgery for a tear in his right elbow.
Realizing time might be running out, he took a chance and continued
to play seven more years.
</P>
<P>
   ``At that point in time, I felt it was too late in my career,
and rehabilitation time was over a year. I didn't feel that was
realistic,'' Ryan said. ``It just finally healed on its own where I
could continue to pitch.''
</P>
<P>
   The relationship between Ryan and the Astros soured at the end
of the 1988 season when the club asked him to take a cut in base
salary (he was making about $1.4 million at the time). On Dec. 7,
1988, Ryan signed a free-agent contract with the Rangers for $1.8
million and proceeded to baffle opposing batters for five more
seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan, who threw no-hitters in three decades, won 69 games and
pitched two of those no-hitters after turning 40 years old.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember walking out of that room thinking, `My God, we've
just signed Nolan Ryan,''' former Rangers general manager Tom
Grieve recalls.
</P>
<P>
   It was as a Ranger that Ryan achieved some of his most memorable
moments, among them his 5,000th strikeout, sixth and seventh
no-hitters, and 300th win.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan's career ended when a torn ligament in his right elbow
forced him to leave a game two weeks before the end of the 1993
season. With him, he took 53 records _ owned or shared _ and no
regrets.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way I look at my career is I was very fortunate, and I was
happy with it,'' said Ryan, the first professional athlete to have
his number retired by three teams (Rangers, Astros and Angels). ``I
don't think you have regrets. I would have liked to gotten into
more postseason play, but a lot of times you don't have control of
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Of all his achievements, Ryan is proudest of his durability.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't really reflect (on my career), but I think I pretty
much get the most satisfaction out of being able to pitch as long
as I did,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   While many believe he will wear a Rangers cap on his Cooperstown
plaque, Ryan said Saturday he will wait to make a final decision.
Five Hall of Famers spent time with the Astros. None, however,
wears an Astros cap.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I came to Houston as a free agent, I really thought and
anticipated that they would be the last team I'd play for,'' said
Ryan, who initially signed a three-year deal with the Astros with
an option for a fourth. ``I never anticipated that I was going to
stay in Houston for nine years.''
</P>
<P>
   And even then, he seemed only to be getting started.

ALTERNATIVE FUEL VEHICLES FACE MANY ROADBLOCKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MARY JO PITZL  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Frank Devine wanted to buy a clean car. One that ran on
something other than gasoline. One that would not foul the air.
</P>
<P>
   But east side, west side, north and south, he could not locate a
dealer in the Valley that carried what he wanted: a Chevy Cavalier
with a lively engine that would run on both compressed natural gas
and gasoline.
</P>
<P>
   So he bought a gas-powered car and planned to convert it, only
to discover there isn't a conversion kit able to handle the job.
</P>
<P>
   His dilemma reflects the roadblocks Arizona faces as it tries to
clean up its air by weaning motorists from gasoline-powered cars
and trucks.
</P>
<P>
   The state has built a national reputation on its incentives to
encourage businesses and individuals to use vehicles that run on
compressed natural gas, electricity, propane, hydrogen or solar
energy. This week, &UR; the most lucrative incentives took effect:
tiered tax credits that offer the biggest benefit to the cleanest
cars. They could erase the extra cost of buying an alternative-fuel
vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the enticements have been virtually fruitless.
</P>
<P>
   Of 3.3 million registered cars and trucks on Arizona's roads,
only about 6,600 use alternative fuels. With numbers like that, the
environmental effect of such vehicles is obscured like the profile
of South Mountain on a bad-air day.
</P>
<P>
   Proponents say those numbers don't give the full picture of
alternative fuels and their potential for cleaning up the Valley's
air.
</P>
<P>
   As last week's high-pollution advisories and daytime haze
reminded, vehicle exhaust is a key source of air pollution. Factor
in the 60 million miles a day that motorists pile up on Valley
roads, and the air pollution benefit of cars driving on low- or
zero-emitting fuels is enormous.
</P>
<P>
   And there's the added plus of reducing reliance on foreign oil.
</P>
<P>
   ``You wouldn't need the Seventh Fleet sitting in the (Persian)
Gulf. You don't have to worry about who's going to become buddies
with Saddam next week,'' said House Speaker Jeff Groscost, the
lawmaker who has spearheaded Arizona's alternative-fuel policies.
</P>
<P>
   Amanda Ormond, director of the state Energy Office, said it will
take 20 to 30 years to make the technology shift to new fuels. &QL; 
BUMPS IN THE ROAD
</P>
<P>
   The first five years have been slow going. The reasons for the
sputtering start are many:
</P>
<P>
   Often, Valley car dealers simply aren't prepared to sell cars
that run on anything other than gasoline. Calls to Chevrolet,
Chrysler and Toyota dealerships yielded no information about
whether they sell such cars, even though those manufacturers make
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never heard that question come up, and I've been here
five months,'' said a salesperson at Lou Grubb Chevrolet.
</P>
<P>
   Fuel can be hard to find. There are only seven fueling stations
for compressed natural gas, five for propane and 34 charging
stations for electric vehicles in the Valley.
</P>
<P>
   The technology seems foreign to most people, who don't realize,
for example, that a car powered by compressed natural gas drives
just as well as one fueled by gasoline.
</P>
<P>
   The upfront cost can be daunting, and the incentives designed to
bring down the price can be baffling. Although cars fueled by
compressed natural gas tend to cost less in the long run than those
that run on gasoline, cost comparisons are not readily available to
most customers.
</P>
<P>
   And the state, busy creating legal sticks and financial carrots,
hasn't publicized them _ or enforced them. Groscost said the state
needs to fire up a public relations campaign on how motorists can
drive out of air pollution.
</P>
<P>
   One thing is certain: The fuels pollute less than gasoline and
diesel.
</P>
<P>
   A 1998 Ford Crown Victoria that runs on compressed natural gas,
for example, produced 66 percent fewer hydrocarbons than a
comparable gas-fueled Crown Victoria, according to a test done by
at a local emissions station.
</P>
<P>
   The natural-gas car produced 40 percent less carbon monoxide and
registered zero for oxides of nitrogen, a chief component of ozone
pollution.
</P>
<P>
   Electric and hydrogen-powered cars don't even have to take the
emissions test because they don't burn fossil fuel.
</P>
<P>
   For motorists willing to drive such cars and trucks, Arizona
offers everything from thousands of dollars in tax credits to
nearly free auto registration and unrestricted use of the coveted
HOV freeway lanes. &QL; 
STATE SNAFUS
</P>
<P>
   Five years ago, the Legislature ordered all government fleets in
the Valley to convert to alternative fuels. They were to be the
trailblazers, stimulating the market and leading to the
installation of fueling stations throughout the Valley.
</P>
<P>
   But even that strategy hasn't run according to plan.
</P>
<P>
   None of the government fleets met a state mandate requiring 90
percent of their vehicles to run on alternative fuels by December
1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could have told you that five years ago,'' Ormond said.
``The standards we set were so incredibly high.''
</P>
<P>
   There are no penalties for missing the deadline, and 14
government agencies have dropped out of the program altogether.
They say high costs prevent them from making the switch to
cleaner-burning vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   Ormond said it makes little sense to punish the agencies. Many
of the obstacles are beyond the control of local governments, she
observed.
</P>
<P>
   For example, a hail storm in Manhattan, Kan., last year caused
several months' delay in Phoenix getting 52 Ford pickups that run
on either gasoline or natural gas. The trucks were shipped to
Kansas for modifications to their fuel systems when they were
pockmarked with hail. Phoenix bought the repaired trucks at a
discount.
</P>
<P>
   In another case, state fleet officials were so frustrated about
Ford's delay in delivering 134 alt-fuel vehicles that they fired
off a letter to Ford's chairman and CEO, Alex Trotman. He never
responded.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the obstacles, some government agencies have embraced
the shift to the new fuels.
</P>
<P>
   The state's Capitol Police is the first force in the United
States to patrol in an exclusively alternative-fuel fleet. The
small department uses 11 Crown Victorias that run on compressed
natural gas.
</P>
<P>
   The city of Phoenix has the largest fleet of alternative
vehicles in the state, numbering more than 900. More are on the
way. The city's new buses, which hit the streets last summer, are
powered by liquefied natural gas instead of diesel, a move that is
reducing the smelly black plumes of exhaust.
</P>
<P>
   As these fleets expand, the state policy aims to spread the
message to private fleets, hoping to lure them with big tax breaks.
</P>
<P>
   But the private fleets haven't taken the bait.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tough to compete against ARCO at 95 cents a gallon,''
said Ed Hempelman, a senior account salesman with Southwest Gas
Corp.
</P>
<P>
   There are faint signs of progress. Castle Boutique, a chain of
adult bookstores, converted its truck to also run on compressed
natural gas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I live here, too,'' said Taylor Coleman, president and CEO of
the Castle Superstore Corp. ``I know having a vehicle that puts out
less emissions is very important.''
</P>
<P>
   SuperShuttle long has run on compressed natural gas, due to a
city mandate that it use clean-burning vans to and from Sky Harbor
International Airport.
</P>
<P>
   The state's incentive system favors cars built to run
exclusively on alternative fuels.
</P>
<P>
   This cools the fervor of business owners to take the less costly
step of converting their vehicles, said Nathan Learner, president
of AZ Star Alternative Fuels, a conversion company.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has nothing to do with the environment,'' Learner said.
``It has everything to do with economics.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite his frustrations with slow movement in the conversion
market, Learner knows that a lot of his success hinges on the gas
pump.
</P>
<P>
   ``When gasoline goes to 2 dollars a gallon, I'll be a popular
guy,'' he said. ``But I can't tell you when that will happen.'' &QL; 
NOT EASY FOR INDIVIDUALS
</P>
<P>
   Individual motorists are the last component in a switch to
alternative fuels. Their impact could be significant.
</P>
<P>
   But local dealers aren't rushing to get Valley motorists into
such cars. At Mel Clayton Ford, a salesperson said he could provide
an alternative-fuel vehicle. But he wasn't encouraging.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's some tax advantages, if you're a `green' person,'' he
said. But the price is high, and finding someone to maintain the
car could be a problem, he added.
</P>
<P>
   General Motors' EV-1, the first mass-marketed electric car since
the early days of autos, isn't aggressively pushed, despite the
fact the Valley is one of only three spots in the United States
where it's offered for lease.
</P>
<P>
   Radio and print ads don't give the address of dealers, only a
Web address and a toll-free number that frequently requires long
waits for service.
</P>
<P>
   In two years, about 100 of the cars have been leased between
Tucson and Phoenix, and 400 in Southern California.
</P>
<P>
   The people who do manage to get a car powered by electricity or
compressed natural gas on the road face other annoyances.
</P>
<P>
   Ted Hidinger can't count the number of Department of Public
Safety officers who have pulled him over while he's driving solo in
the freeway carpool lanes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's amazing to me how ignorant people are of our own laws,''
said Hidinger, a senior consultant at Arizona Public Service Co.
``And the general public flips me off when I drive by.''
</P>
<P>
   Most people who buy alternative-fuel cars aren't acting on a
whim. They're deliberate and motivated to do what it takes to find
the right car.
</P>
<P>
   Devine is one.
</P>
<P>
   An early skeptic, he became a believer in the clean-air benefits
of such cars after working with them as maintenance administrator
for the Washington Elementary School District.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it wouldn't work if you didn't put gasoline in it,''
Devine recalled with a laugh.
</P>
<P>
   But the cars did well, despite lingering suspicions that blamed
the new fuel for all sorts of unrelated automotive maladies. A lack
of places to refuel continues to be an obstacle. But the number of
stations is growing.
</P>
<P>
   The state will open a public fueling station late this winter
near the Capitol. Electric charging stations are popping up at
shopping malls, at Texaco gas stations and at Monti's La Casa Vieja
in Tempe _ making the restaurant a popular spot for EV-1 drivers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like a hummingbird feeder out there,'' said owner Michael
Monti, who drives his own EV-1. ``I go out there one day, and
there's a red EV. The next day, there's a green one.''
</P>
<P>
   Cost also has been a barrier, which is why state policymakers
have created the incentives over the past five years.
</P>
<P>
   But unraveling the stack of tax credits and deductions is far
from simple. Auto dealers can't or won't compute the potential
savings of buying an alt-fuel car. At Honda of Mesa, salesmen said
they're waiting for the state to give them a checklist that
summarizes the savings.
</P>
<P>
   In California, the approach is straightforward: The state buys
down the cost of the vehicles. &UR; That's why the EV-1 leases for $399
a month in California, while in Arizona, it's $499.
</P>
<P>
   But those tax incentives have frayed the nerves of GM reps, who
say they can't get Arizona officials to tell them how a potentially
lucrative $10,000 tax break would apply to their EV-1s.
</P>
<P>
   Ormond said the Legislature will have to unravel the problem.
That means that although the break took effect Jan. 1, it wouldn't
be available until late spring, at best. &QL; 
EYE ON FUTURE
</P>
<P>
   Some experts believe the fuel technology that will have the
biggest effect is not yet on the streets. The electric car, for
example, is likely a bridge to more popular and efficient forms of
transportation, said Dick Thompson, director of communications for
GM's advanced-technology vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's transitional, leading to who knows what's next?'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Others see hydrogen as the long-term answer because it doesn't
burn fossil fuels and produces no emissions.
</P>
<P>
   Although electric vehicles also have zero tailpipe emissions,
many get their juice from coal-fired electric plants.
</P>
<P>
   And battery disposal is still a vexing problem &UR; because the
batteries contain lead.
</P>
<P>
   The only hydrogen vehicles on the road in the Valley are created
and owned by hobbyists. But members of the Phoenix Rotary Club 100
are trying to convince the international organization to adopt
hydrogen as the group's next worldwide initiative, since it
wouldn't involve burning a fossil fuel.
</P>
<P>
   And that makes sense to Devine.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they get the technology to store it in smaller spaces and
have it in vehicles,'' he said, ``it'll happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Until then, Devine will continue his quest to join the first
wave of lower-polluting vehicles by finding a conversion kit for
his car. &QL;

FOR CLEAN AIR ADVOCATES, PRACTICALITY OFTEN OUTWEIGHS PRINCIPLE 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   Finding folks who drive alternatively fueled cars is tough, even
among the clean-air crowd.
</P>
<P>
   The Sierra Club, the American Lung Association of Arizona, even
the director of the state's Energy Office, don't have an alt-fuel
car among them.
</P>
<P>
   Take the Lung Association. It's in the forefront of the Valley's
push to clean up air pollution and often has sued to force change.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the group has nary an alternatively fueled vehicle in its
small fleet.
</P>
<P>
   Not that the idea hasn't crossed their minds, said Dave
Feuerherd, program manager for the Lung Association. Negotiations
faltered over plans to add an electric vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they get a CNG (compressed natural gas) van, and if we
can afford it, we'll go for it,'' Feuerherd said.
</P>
<P>
   Nor will you find members of the Sierra Club tooling around in
such cars.
</P>
<P>
   Rob Smith, the club's Southwest staff director, couldn't think
of anyone who drives an alt-fuel car.
</P>
<P>
   Amanda Ormond, who as director of the state's Energy Office
oversees the state's alternative-fuel policies, is thinking about
converting a vehicle to run on both gasoline and CNG.
</P>
<P>
   It will make even more sense when a fueling station opens near
her Tempe home, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Jane Hull does not use alternative fuels, although she has
signed legislation promoting their use.
</P>
<P>
   Her predecessor, Fife Symington, tried to drum up support for
the movement by having his state-owned car converted to run on both
gasoline and CNG. But that lasted for only the one-year duration of
his car's lease.
</P>
<P>
   There's one policymaker who walks, or drives, the talk.
</P>
<P>
   House Speaker Jeff Groscost, the sponsor of most of Arizona's
alternative-fuel legislation, drives a 1994 Dodge Intrepid that
runs on gas and CNG.
</P>
<P>
   He reels off the benefits like the best of pitchmen _ everything
from reduced auto emissions to less reliance on foreign oil. But
there's one perk he's especially fond of: unrestricted use of the
carpool lane, even if he's driving alone.
</P>
<P>
   The Mesa Republican estimates he saves up to 1{ hours on his
commute between the East Valley and the Capitol.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why the formerly late Jeff Groscost is now the on-time
Jeff Groscost,'' he boasts.
</P>
<P>
   There were 6,589 alternative-fuel vehicles in Arizona in 1998,
according to state statistics.
</P>
<P>
   Half of those were in government fleets, which by state mandate
must convert to alternative fuels.
</P>
<P>
   By far, the most prevalent fuel type was compressed natural gas,
used by half of the alt-fuel fleet. Liquefied natural gas is the
next most popular, and electric vehicles were a distant third. &QL;

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DALE ROBERTSON  
 c. 1998, Houston Chronicle  
IRVING _ All along, you sort of suspected these Dallas Cowboys
weren't much good. The 10-6 record was surely a ruse, given that
fully 80 percent of their W's were inherently tainted, having come
at the expense of their four NFC Least rivals.
<TEXT>
<P>
   But, OK, Dallas had looked pretty stout in whupping modestly
resurgent Washington last weekend and, praise the Lord, Deion
Sanders, he of the most famous toe since Lou Groza's, was back.
Besides, Arizona's abject lack of playoff pedigree seemed too much
for our feathered friends from the Arizona desert to overcome.
</P>
<P>
   The Bidwill family's bumbling, bird-brained franchise had not
tasted triumph in a playoff game since 1947, the year Al Capone
died, Chuck Yeager broke the sound barrier and Jackie Robinson
integrated baseball.
</P>
<P>
   Did I mention Harry Truman's becoming the first president to
address the American public via TV? Indeed, that happened in '47,
too.
</P>
<P>
   By any measure, that was a long, long time ago. Owner Bill
Bidwill, now portly and gray, was a 16-year-old water boy for the
NFL champion Cardinals, who called Chicago's Comiskey Park home.
</P>
<P>
   On the weight of tradition and recent results alone, the Cowboys
wore the look of prohibitive favorites Saturday. When Sanders, in a
well-orchestrated, typically Deionesque move, jogged out late to a
worshipful roar from the Texas Stadium faithful, you half-expected
a raft of white flags to pop up on the Arizona bench.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm glad Deion played,'' observed Larry Centers, one of
Arizona's longest-suffering Cardinals. ``That way, they didn't have
any excuses.''
</P>
<P>
   Once the game began, it was the Cowboys who took on the look of
postseason rubes, a bumbling bunch of turnips tumbling
helter-skelter off the proverbial truck. Ultimately, the only
surprising development would be the Cowboys' actually scoring a
late-fourth-quarter touchdown, thus averting the additional umbrage
of being shut out by a team that hadn't prevailed in a
second-season knockout game in more than half a century.
</P>
<P>
   ``This,'' Bidwill conceded, ``was our biggest win in 51 years.
Oh, boy. I'm numb.''
</P>
<P>
   Funny. So was Jerry Jones. Except I think he was having a
stroke.
</P>
<P>
   Hadn't Dallas beaten Arizona 16 out of 17 times? And nine in a
row in Texas? Hadn't Emmitt Smith run for almost 250 yards in the
two regular-season meetings? Hadn't Troy Aikman thrown for some 464
yards, completing just under 65 percent of his passes? Hadn't the
Cowboys scored 73 points at the expense of the Cardinals'
crimson-faced defenders?
</P>
<P>
   All true. But all utterly, completely and totally meaningless
data. Ditto Dallas' five Super Bowl championships and NFL records
for playoff seasons and playoff victories.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't matter who the president was the last time the
Cardinals won in the playoffs,'' Arizona coach Vince Tobin
protested afterward.
</P>
<P>
   No, what mattered was the Cardinals had the Plummer, and Dallas
had the leaks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're living in the present,'' Jake Plummer said. ``The past
is the past. We can't do anything about it. The past is over.''
</P>
<P>
   They call young Jake ``the Snake,'' and they should, considering
how slithery and coldblooded he is for his age. He almost
quarterbacked Arizona State to a national championship a couple
years ago, and now here he is in his second NFL season beating the
Cowboys in January and behaving, as Centers said, ``like a six- or
seven-year veteran.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Sanders, who tends to be a tad self-absorbed, paid homage.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a Jake Plummer fan,'' Deion acknowledged. ``A lot of times
we forced him to make plays, and he did. He played a wonderful
game. He's going to be a premier player in the league.''
</P>
<P>
   Going to be? He already is. Granted, he suffered a couple dumb
picks, but he also passed for a pair of touchdowns _ the first on
the most beautifully executed shovel pass you will ever see _ and
overshadowed the great 'Boy Troy at almost every turn.
</P>
<P>
   Aikman was dreadful, no two ways about it. He made bad reads and
worse throws. Perhaps Arizona's inspired defensive effort was the
reason, or maybe a few early dropped balls broke his spirit, but he
never found any rhythm. He couldn't sustain a drive.
</P>
<P>
   He couldn't keep the football out of Aeneas Williams' hands,
either. And when Williams wasn't intercepting Ache-man's passes _
he stole two of them _ Dallas was either punting, blowing a gimmie
36-yard field goal or failing to convert a fourth-and-one at the
Arizona seven.
</P>
<P>
   There, when it was still a 7-0 game and Arizona's upset bid was
barely pipe-dream stuff, the Cowboys couldn't get a yard even with
the ball in Emmitt Smith's esteemed hands. Mark Maddox met Emmitt
head-on and drove him backward. It was the last moment the Cowboys
sniffed the end zone with the outcome in the least bit of doubt.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously,'' Dallas coach Chan Gailey said later, ``this is
not how I thought I would be standing before you today. It's a sore
loss for our team, not how we wanted to end the season.''
</P>
<P>
   It was, nonetheless, a more realistic end than a trip to the
Super Bowl would have been. The Cowboys weren't a super team by any
stretch. They were only the best of a bodaciously bad lot, and the
fraud they were perpetrating was certain to be exposed once
everyone began playing for keeps.
</P>
<P>
   Bidwill, for one, gleaned no special pleasure from the fact his
impossibly quixotic quest reached fruition at the expense of such a
revered franchise as Dallas, this decade's lone three-time
champion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would have been very happy today,'' he mused, ``to beat
anybody.''

UCONN SHOWS HOYAS WHO'S NO. 1 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM GREENIDGE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  STORRS, Conn. _ One of the University of Connecticut players
had to stress to coach Jim Calhoun after Saturday night's game that
the Huskies were still undefeated after they wiped out Georgetown,
87-64.
</P>
<P>
   It's just that UConn, ranked first in the country throughout the
first five weeks of the season, led by 22 at halftime and got a bit
bored in the second half. The Huskies allowed Georgetown to get as
close as 13 points (57-44) on a 3-pointer by the Hoyas' Anthony
Perry with just 13 minutes remaining, and that didn't please
Calhoun.
</P>
<P>
   Playing in front of 10,027 at Gampel Pavilion, UConn got its
lead back to 20 points again, 67-47, with nine minutes left when
sophomore forward Edmund Saunders canned a layup. But Georgetown,
with two freshman in the backcourt, was only outscored by 1 in the
second half, 44-43.
</P>
<P>
   UConn (11-0, 3-0) had four players in double figures. Khalid
El-Amin pumped in 22 points, while Kevin Freeman and Richard
Hamilton had 16 and 15, respectively. Georgetown (7-5, 0-3) had
three players in double figures, and was led by Anthony Perry's 24,
a career high.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looked like we were playing the scoreboard, as opposed to
playing the game,'' said Calhoun, who is now third in the Big East
in wins with 140, one better than former St. John's coach Lou
Carnesecca. Thompson leads with 231, while Syracuse's Jim Boeheim
has 227. ``Give Georgetown credit in the second half, though,''
said Calhoun. ``It got the ball low, and it went after the glass.''
</P>
<P>
   Calhoun didn't like that his team shot 53.3 percent (16 of 30)
in the first half and was a mere 34.4 percent (11 of 32) in the
second. The reverse was true of Georgetown, which shot 22.2 percent
(8 of 36) in the first half, 45.9 percent (17 of 37) in the second.
</P>
<P>
   ``No excuses, though, as one kid said to me in the locker room,
we didn't lose, and we won by 23 points,'' Calhoun said. ``We were
inconsistent. Maybe it was the fact that we've been practicing
eight straight days. So we have (Sunday) off. We just didn't
maintain our pressure against a young team. We're pleased, though,
that we're in a decent position.''
</P>
<P>
   Georgetown, which had 10 turnovers the first half (18 for the
game), trailed 7-0 after the first 2 1/2 minutes. Ricky Moore cut
to the basket for a layup and hit a free throw for a 3-point play.
Then Moore made a foul shot, Freeman put back a rebound, and
El-Amin hit a jumper. It was 14-2 with 15:47 left when UConn's
Souleymane Wane made a layup. The Huskies kept it up, scoring 10 of
the next 12 points in building a 22-4 lead on a 3-pointer by
El-Amin.
</P>
<P>
   ``Early in the game we were very tense, sometimes (that happens)
when some of the younger kids come out on the road for the first
time,'' Thompson said. ``Then you relax, you get acclimated to some
of the things you need to get acclimated to, but you can't play a
team as good as Connecticut and get it all back. This has been a
tough year for us, but we'll be fine.''
</P>
<P>
   At one point Thompson, trademark white towel flung over his
shoulder, kidded with El-Amin. ``I kept telling him that he was a
passer, so go back to passing the ball around rather than shooting
it,'' he kidded. ``But he didn't force things. He took shots that
were open.
</P>
<P>
   ``And then when we got it to 13 points, we started to make young
mistakes again.''
</P>
<P>
   Calhoun wants his team to play just as it does in practice _
never letting up.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the way I want to play in games,'' he said. ``We didn't
play to our advantage during those last 20 minutes. We have to make
sure that we stay focused, stay sharp. We did what we needed to do
during the first half, that's when we made the extra pass. But
we've got to stay focused.''

<P>
   MIAMI _ Although generally outplayed by the Miami Dolphins, the
Buffalo Bills almost pulled out a come-from-behind victory Saturday
afternoon _ a Doug Flutie special.
</P>
<P>
   The Bills believed it was taken away from them _ by Miami's
overzealous defenders, who stripped them of the football four
times, and by an overzealous official who denied them a touchdown
when he was bumped by receiver Andre Reed.
</P>
<P>
   In a season in which referees have come under every scrutiny
short of a congressional investigation, Saturday's AFC wild-card
playoff game brought the din of protest to a new level.
</P>
<P>
   The Dolphins won 24-17 at Pro Player Stadium, but the Bills
might have forced an overtime if field judge Steve Zimmer hadn't
penalized Reed for unsportsmanlike conduct and ejected him for the
bump.
</P>
<P>
   The Bills were on the Miami 10 yard-line, trailing 24-14 with
two minutes left, when Reed caught a pass close to the goal line.
The Bills thought he had crossed it, but the officials ruled not
quite.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still say Andre was in the end zone,'' Flutie said. ``I
think Andre was just getting up and he happened to bump an
official. It wasn't anything intentional. At playoff time, you
don't take a touchdown away from a team for something like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Reed said, ``I didn't even know he (Zimmer) was there. I heard
somebody running up behind me, but I thought it was a player.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bills were pushed back to the Dolphins' 15-yard line, and
after two incompletions they had to settle for a field goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``With Andre out, we had to move people around and put them in
positions they hadn't been playing,'' Flutie said. ``Kevin Williams
had to move into Andre's position, and we had to put a tight end,
Jay Riemersma, at wide receiver.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Bills fought valiantly. They recovered an onside kick
and drove to the Miami five-yard line, where they had a first down
with 17 seconds remaining.
</P>
<P>
   Flutie tried to tie the score with a slant to Williams, but he
was covered. Before the 5-10 quarterback could throw the ball away,
defensive end Trace Armstrong hit Flutie and knocked it loose.
Miami's other end, Shane Burton, recovered the fumble, and the game
was over.
</P>
<P>
   It was the second time in the game that Flutie was blindsided
into a costly fumble. ``In both situations,'' he said, ``I didn't
see him.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dolphins said Buffalo's fumbles were not entirely
accidental.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stripping the ball is the first thing we practice every day,''
coach Jimmy Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   The tone was set on the first play from scrimmage. Buffalo's
Eric Moulds (nine receptions for 240 yards) beat Terrell Buckley
for a 65-yard reception. But he lost the ball when Buckley grabbed
him from behind, and Brock Marion recovered.
</P>
<P>
   ``They ran a post, and he caught the ball out in front,''
Buckley said, ``so I pushed him and held onto him. Our attitude is
they're going to make some catches on us, but we're taught to
finish the play, get a good lick on them and try to strip the
ball.''
</P>
<P>
   Buckley said the Buffalo receivers ``were not getting the ball
into their body quickly, and that's why we had some of the
takeaways.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dolphins capitalized on the first takeaway, with quarterback
Dan Marino leading them 57 yards to a 31-yard field goal by Olindo
Mare.
</P>
<P>
   The Bills were trailing 17-14 in the fourth quarter when nickel
back Jerry Wilson stripped the ball from Reed's hands, and Buckley
recovered. Marino then took his team 50 yards, mixing in four runs
with five passes, the last one an 11-yard touchdown to Lamar
Thomas.
</P>
<P>
   Down 24-14 with 3:42 remaining, Flutie was far from through.
With a five-receiver formation, he picked apart the skilled Miami
secondary.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we went exclusively to the spread package, they couldn't
defend it,'' Flutie said. For the day, he was 21-of-36 for 360
yards with one interception. Marino was 23-of-34 for 235 yards with
an interception.
</P>
<P>
   But on this day, the Dolphins had the better running game. They
outrushed Buffalo 117-77, and Miami dominated in time of
possession, 37:32 to 22:28.
</P>
<P>
   Marino is the all-time touchdown king, but the Dolphins are 1-7
in postseason games in which he has thrown more than 35 passes.
They are 6-1 when he has thrown fewer than 35 times.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have the same intentions that Denver had last year, a wild
card winning the Super Bowl,'' Miami cornerback Sam Madison said.
</P>
<P>
   If the Jacksonville Jaguars beat New England in their playoff
game today, the Dolphins next Saturday will play the Broncos, whom
they beat 31-21 last month.
</P>
<P>
   As for the Bills, they can do nothing but lament the footballs
that were taken away and the bump-and-get-run play that proved so
fateful.

BAD START, WILDER FINISH FOR USC
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It took USC six weeks to build an 8-1
nonconference record, but only 16 minutes of its Pacific-10 opener
to nearly squander the respect it earned from the successful start.
</P>
<P>
   Not even one half into its first league game Saturday night, the
Trojans trailed Arizona State by 18 points, and seemed easy targets
for those claiming they benefited from a soft schedule.
</P>
<P>
   The critics will have to wait a while longer before that
argument sticks, however, because the Trojans mounted a spirited
comeback and defeated the Sun Devils 72-70 before 3,072 at the
Sports Arena.
</P>
<P>
   USC (9-1, 1-0) averted a disaster at the start of Pac-10 play by
outscoring Arizona State 52-32 in the final 24 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   It also took one dramatic defensive stop to assure the victory.
With 8.1 seconds left, the Sun Devils (8-5, 0-1) were in position
to tie or possibly win the game, trailing by two points. But USC
guard Quincy Wilder poked the ball away from Sun Devils guard Eddie
House, and guard Alton Mason traveled during a frantic attempt to
pick up the loose ball and shoot with less than a second remaining.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw an opportunity when House crossed the ball over to poke
it loose. And I figured with my longer wingspan I could,'' Wilder
said.
</P>
<P>
   USC's comeback was spurred primarily by Wilder, who scored a
career-high 13 points in his best game of the season, and shooting
guard Elias Ayuso, who scored 18 points, including four 3-pointers.
</P>
<P>
   Wilder and Ayuso were the only Trojans in double figures besides
the reliable Brian Scalabrine, who made 10 of 12 shots and had a
game-high 25 points.
</P>
<P>
   ``It didn't look good for a while there,'' USC coach Henry Bibby
said. ``At the beginning, they didn't miss any shots. They made
tough shots, they were knocking shots down. But our defense picked
up when Quincy Wilder and Larry (Elias) Ayuso went into the game
and our intensity picked up.''
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans finally tied the contest 60-60 with 6:18 remaining
when Ayuso hit a 3-pointer. Arizona State pulled ahead 65-62, but
Wilder hit a 3-pointer with 2:30 left, his first of the season, as
the 35-second clock was about to expire.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coach Bibby takes me out of practice if I don't shoot the
ball,'' Wilder said. ``The clock was running down and I really felt
in the flow of the game.''
</P>
<P>
   That was Wilder's biggest play, before his defensive stop at the
end.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been waiting for our veteran players to pick it up,''
Bibby said. ``We've been waiting for our shooters to pick it up.''
</P>
<P>
   Bibby was referring to Ayuso. The senior guard has slumped this
season, shooting only 32 percent on 3-point attempts. On Saturday,
Bibby benched him for the first time this season. And it worked.
</P>
<P>
   ``The past few games haven't been going well for me. I've been
struggling,'' Ayuso said. ``It did push me a lot, but I kind of
expected (being benched) because I haven't been doing the job. We
need a shooter.''
</P>
<P>
   Notes: USC is off to its best start since 1975-76, when the
Trojans started 11-1.... The Trojans shot a season-high 59.6
percent. Monday's game against Arizona has become a businessman's
special and will tip off at 1 p.m. at the Sports Arena.

RESENDING FOR ALL NEEDING 
COACH, QUARTERBACK ARE NOT ONLY RESIDENTS IN DOGHOUSE
</HEADLINE>

c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ Through the Texas twilight, cold and bleak, a
voice shaking with frustration and rage echoed in the upper reaches
of fast-emptying Texas Stadium late yesterday. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Dog! Dog! Dog!'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This time it wasn't Troy Aikman, screaming at his offensive
line. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The fan, clearly in abject agony, ran out of breath before
counting all 47 of them, but there was no misinterpreting his
meaning. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   With all due apologies to man's best friend, we came yesterday
expecting a first-round NFL playoff game and caught the American
Kennel Club Follies instead. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Nor was there a blue ribbon for the Cowboys as Best of Show.
They did, however, capture consolation prize as Biggest Dog of the
day and for showing they can still roll over and play dead. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Cardinals 20, Cowboys 7 not only means an early exit from the
playoffs for Dallas, it also opens up the team, its coaches and its
players to a hard, intensive review. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Insert gleeful hand-rubbing and chop-licking here. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It's all well and good to feel warm and fuzzy about rebounding
from 6-10 a year ago to 10-6 and an NFC East championship, even if
the division did reek with ineptitude. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   To be embarrassed as they were yesterday, however, was a
disgrace. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We won 10 games this season and I doubt there were many in
this room who thought we could do that,'' Aikman said defensively
in the interview room afterward. ``For anyone other than those in
our locker room to imply that we've had a bad year would be wrong.
``We're'' disappointed. No one else in this room should be.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   What nonsense. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   We shouldn't be disappointed because the Cowboys couldn't beat a
mediocre team that hadn't won a postseason game in more than half a
century? We shouldn't be disappointed that the Cowboys looked more
canine than primetime in their biggest game of the year? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Aikman was almost as far off the mark with that line of bilge
water as he was with most of his passes. On a day when the Cowboys
needed the guy with three Super Bowl rings to step up and take
charge of his team, he wasn't even the best quarterback on the
field. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It took Deion Sanders, of all people, to face facts and put the
proper spin on what happened yesterday. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``If we're supposed to be big-time players, we're supposed to
perform in big-time games,'' said Sanders, who took an injection in
his injured left big toe before the game that allowed him to play
for the first time in six weeks. ``We're all accountable; all of
us. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``People on this team have been holding their tongues but I'm
very angry. We all need to look at ourselves, me included, and how
we played today.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   What they see won't be pretty, especially offensively. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We did not show up to play,'' Aikman said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   He didn't intend it that way, but that's an indictment of
Gailey, who was grim with disappointment at how his first season as
a head coach concluded. It is his responsibility to gauge his
team's emotional level and provide the motivational spark it
needs. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the Cowboys continued to remain unfocused and make the
same mistakes that plagued them through most of December. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``A ball gets tipped, we drop a pass, we fumble a snap, we get a
penalty. ... we just can't win playing that way,'' Gailey said.
``The mistakes kept us from developing any rhythm or consistency
offensively.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It is the head coach who must be held accountable for that lack
of focus. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And what of the quarterback? Aikman will go down in NFL history
as one of its most efficient passers ever. He's on his way to the
Hall of Fame. But where's the passion when this team needs it?
Where's the leadership and the fire, the willpower and
determination, that not only made Staubach and Montana Hall of
Famers, but legends as well? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``They \Rthe Cardinals\S have a quarterback who can run when you
pressure him and still make plays,'' Sanders pointed out, and if he
didn't mean to draw a direct comparison of young and mobile Jake
Plummer to Aikman, he made it easy for the rest of us to do it for
him. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Needing a big game, Aikman instead was sacked four times and
threw three interceptions. He wasn't alone in his misery. His
receivers, especially Michael Irvin and Billy Davis, continually
dropped passes and were rarely open. Aikman had no deep threat, no
one who could stretch the Cardinals' defense. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Erik Williams continued to draw flags for false starts and
holding. Guard Nate Newton and center Mike Kiselak missed key
blocks. Trailing 7-0, the Cowboys failed to make a critical
fourth-and-one at the Cardinals' 7 midway through the second
quarter when no one picked up an inside blitz. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Coaches around here have been flayed alive for making calls like
that. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Those were the physical flaws. Worse, though, was that the
Cowboys had the look of a team that really didn't care. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``You got to want a game like this,'' Sanders said. ``How can
you look at yourself in the mirror if you didn't go out there and
give it your all?'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   We should have handed him the pens and notepads, since he was
asking the questions that most needed answers. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``The nucleus of this team isn't getting any younger,'' Sanders
said. ``If I was Mr. Jones, spending the money he's spending, I
wouldn't put up with it.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Those of us standing way too close to the fire hydrant couldn't
agree more. &QL;

counting all 47 of them, but there was no misinterpreting his
meaning.
</P>
<P>
   With all due apologies to man's best friend, we came yesterday
expecting a first-round NFL playoff game and caught the American
Kennel Club Follies instead.
</P>
<P>
   Nor was there a blue ribbon for the Cowboys as Best of Show.
They did, however, capture consolation prize as Biggest Dog of the
day and for showing they can still roll over and play dead.
</P>
<P>
   Cardinals 20, Cowboys 7 not only means an early exit from the
playoffs for Dallas, it also opens up the team, its coaches and its
players to a hard, intensive review.
</P>
<P>
   Insert gleeful hand-rubbing and chop-licking here.
</P>
<P>
   It's all well and good to feel warm and fuzzy about rebounding
from 6-10 a year ago to 10-6 and an NFC East championship, even if
the division did reek with ineptitude.
</P>
<P>
   To be embarrassed as they were yesterday, however, was a
disgrace.
</P>
<P>
   ``We won 10 games this season and I doubt there were many in
this room who thought we could do that,'' Aikman said defensively
in the interview room afterward. ``For anyone other than those in
our locker room to imply that we've had a bad year would be wrong.
``We're'' disappointed. No one else in this room should be.''
</P>
<P>
   What nonsense.
</P>
<P>
   We shouldn't be disappointed because the Cowboys couldn't beat a
mediocre team that hadn't won a postseason game in more than half a
century? We shouldn't be disappointed that the Cowboys looked more
canine than primetime in their biggest game of the year?
</P>
<P>
   Aikman was almost as far off the mark with that line of bilge
water as he was with most of his passes. On a day when the Cowboys
needed the guy with three Super Bowl rings to step up and take
charge of his team, he wasn't even the best quarterback on the
field.
</P>
<P>
   It took Deion Sanders, of all people, to face facts and put the
proper spin on what happened yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we're supposed to be big-time players, we're supposed to
perform in big-time games,'' said Sanders, who took an injection in
his injured left big toe before the game that allowed him to play
for the first time in six weeks. ``We're all accountable; all of
us.
</P>
<P>
   ``People on this team have been holding their tongues but I'm
very angry. We all need to look at ourselves, me included, and how
we played today.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   What they see won't be pretty, especially offensively.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did not show up to play,'' Aikman said.
</P>
<P>
   He didn't intend it that way, but that's an indictment of
Gailey, who was grim with disappointment at how his first season as
a head coach concluded. It is his responsibility to gauge his
team's emotional level and provide the motivational spark it needs.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the Cowboys continued to remain unfocused and make the
same mistakes that plagued them through most of December.
</P>
<P>
   ``A ball gets tipped, we drop a pass, we fumble a snap, we get a
penalty. ... we just can't win playing that way,'' Gailey said.
``The mistakes kept us from developing any rhythm or consistency
offensively.''
</P>
<P>
   It is the head coach who must be held accountable for that lack
of focus.
</P>
<P>
   And what of the quarterback? Aikman will go down in NFL history
as one of its most efficient passers ever. He's on his way to the
Hall of Fame. But where's the passion when this team needs it?
Where's the leadership and the fire, the willpower and
determination, that not only made Staubach and Montana Hall of
Famers, but legends as well?
</P>
<P>
   ``They \Rthe Cardinals\S have a quarterback who can run when you
pressure him and still make plays,'' Sanders pointed out, and if he
didn't mean to draw a direct comparison of young and mobile Jake
Plummer to Aikman, he made it easy for the rest of us to do it for
him.
</P>
<P>
   Needing a big game, Aikman instead was sacked four times and
threw three interceptions. He wasn't alone in his misery. His
receivers, especially Michael Irvin and Billy Davis, continually
dropped passes and were rarely open. Aikman had no deep threat, no
one who could stretch the Cardinals' defense.
</P>
<P>
   Erik Williams continued to draw flags for false starts and
holding. Guard Nate Newton and center Mike Kiselak missed key
blocks. Trailing 7-0, the Cowboys failed to make a critical
fourth-and-one at the Cardinals' 7 midway through the second
quarter when no one picked up an inside blitz.
</P>
<P>
   Coaches around here have been flayed alive for making calls like
that.
</P>
<P>
   Those were the physical flaws. Worse, though, was that the
Cowboys had the look of a team that really didn't care.
</P>
<P>
   ``You got to want a game like this,'' Sanders said. ``How can
you look at yourself in the mirror if you didn't go out there and
give it your all?''
</P>
<P>
   We should have handed him the pens and notepads, since he was
asking the questions that most needed answers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The nucleus of this team isn't getting any younger,'' Sanders
said. ``If I was Mr. Jones, spending the money he's spending, I
wouldn't put up with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Those of us standing way too close to the fire hydrant couldn't
agree more.

   IRVING, Texas _ Through the Texas twilight, cold and bleak, a
voice shaking with frustration and rage echoed in the upper reaches
of fast-emptying Texas Stadium late yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dog! Dog! Dog!''
</P>
<P>
   This time it wasn't Troy Aikman, screaming at his offensive
line.
</P>
<P>
   The fan, clearly in abject agony, ran out of breath before
counting all 47 of them, but there was no misinterpreting his

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ TCU coach Billy Tubbs figured he had an easy
game coming his way.
</P>
<P>
   Considering that TCU's previous two games had been decided by 20
seconds and four points, he had been hoping for a cakewalk last
night.
</P>
<P>
   He got better. He got North Carolina-Asheville, and No. 24 TCU
simply sleepwalked through for a 101-67 victory at Daniel-Meyer
Coliseum.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the one thing that we failed to do is give these teams
the credit they deserve,'' Tubbs said. ``We didn't exactly demolish
\RUNC-Asheville\S.''
</P>
<P>
   The Frogs did, however, defeat the Bulldogs without the
last-second, buzzer-beating theatrics that had been necessary in
their two previous games.
</P>
<P>
   Frogs forward Marquise Gainous had to deliver game-winning shots
in TCU's previous two games, against Southwest Missouri State and
Gonzaga. He had a less dramatic, although no less effective, 21
points to lead TCU past UNC-Asheville.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wouldn't have been a problem if I had had to,'' Gainous
said of another game-winning shot. ``It was nice not to be in that
situation though.''
</P>
<P>
   Gainous highlighted a Frogs stat page that featured five players
in double figures, including 16 points from both Lee Nailon and
Ryan Carroll. Prince Fowler added another 15 while Vladimir Jaksic
chipped in 11.
</P>
<P>
   Nailon's numbers look good, yet, Tubbs said Nailon struggled.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look, Lee Nailon shot 7-for-21 and usually 12-for-21 is a bad
night for him,'' Tubbs said. ``We got a lot of guys stepping up,
though. Marquise played well. Prince had a good night. This was
more of a team effort.''
</P>
<P>
   TCU (12-2) has gone unbeaten since losing to Oklahoma State on
Nov. 28 and remains unbeaten at Daniel-Meyer Coliseum.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, UNC-Asheville (1-11) extended its losing streak to
nine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people say we're the best 1-11 team around, but that's
not any compliment,'' Bulldogs coach Eddie Biedenbach said. ``We
weren't able to do it against the people we played.''
</P>
<P>
   Seven of UNC-Asheville's losses have come against teams in the
Top 25, including road losses to No. 11 Purdue, No. 12 St. John's,
No. 13 Michigan State and No. 14 Clemson.
</P>
<P>
   No. 24 TCU actually looked to provide a semi-breather for
UNC-Asheville, looked being a key word.
</P>
<P>
   TCU refused to UNC-Asheville catch its breath.
</P>
<P>
   Gainous and Co. had jumped to a 15-point halftime lead, and
that's with a defense that Tubbs said had played poorly. ``We
weren't able to get out there and dominate defensively,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   When TCU finally got its full-court press clicking, about midway
through second-half play, UNC-Asheville finally got overwhelmed.
TCU finished with a plus-14 margin in turnovers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd been concentrating on defense all week,'' Gainous said,
``and we'd been practicing good.''
</P>
<P>
   TCU now has a layoff before starting Western Athletic Conference
play against SMU on Jan. 11. That begins a stretch of six WAC games
in 14 days for TCU, with first three being away games.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's stupid,'' Tubbs said. ``I just want to give all of the
credit in the world to the WAC office for their infinite wisdom on
the schedule.'' Extra points TCU announced that freshman guard
Michael Causey has decided to withdraw from TCU. He had been
bothered by homesickness, and he hadn't been getting a lot of
playing time. He played in seven of TCU's 14 games this season,
averaging 2.7 points .9 assists and .6 rebounds a game.

TEXANS-LED OKLAHOMA DOMINATE AT LONE STAR DUALS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   GRAND PRAIRIE, Texas _ University of Oklahoma coach Jack Spates
has been kind to the Lone Star State. Texas, in return, has been
kind to him.
</P>
<P>
   Spates helped put together last year's first-ever Lone Star
Duals, bringing one of the nation's premier NCAA wrestling teams to
Arlington to help promote the sport in the state. Yesterday, Spates
brought the Sooners back to an even bigger Lone Star Duals at South
Grand Prairie High School, and his team ended the day with three
dual victories in its cap.
</P>
<P>
   Oklahoma, ranked No. 5 in the nation, defeated Brown, California
State-Bakersfield and Wisconsin to raise its record to 4-1 on the
season. The Sooners also won all three of their duals at last
year's meet.
</P>
<P>
   ``We talked as a team about dominating. We wanted to focus on
ourselves, and wrestle from the start of the match to the end,''
Spates said. ``I really feel that's what we did. I saw a ton of
improvement out here today.''
</P>
<P>
   Oklahoma defeated Brown, 37-6; CSUB, 35-6; and Wisconsin, 37-3.
The Sooners were one of three ranked teams competing in the event,
which expanded from last year's four-team dual. CSUB, ranked 15th,
went 2-1 yesterday. Oregon State, ranked 14th, went 3-0. Virginia,
Wyoming and Northern Iowa also competed.
</P>
<P>
   Oklahoma has been helped in its success recently by Texas
athletes. The Sooners have five Texas natives on the roster,
including regular 184-pound starter Tommy Grossman. Grossman didn't
compete yesterday because of a knee injury, but in his place
against Brown was 1997 Grapevine High School graduate Nick Curcio.
</P>
<P>
   Curcio, a former Texas state high school runner-up, fell 9-3 to
top-20-ranked senior Nate Burroughs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frankly, I was very pleased with the way Nick wrestled,''
Spates said. ``He was competing against a ranked guy, and he didn't
back down. He kept going at him.''
</P>
<P>
   Curcio wasn't the only Texas athlete to compete yesterday.
Marcus graduate and state champion Robbie Rogers was in the lineup
for Brown, losing by technical fall to Oklahoma's Jared Frayer and
beating Wyoming's Justin Gonzalez, 10-5.
</P>
<P>
   The big surprise of the day came in the matchup of Wisconsin
senior Dusty Coufal and No. 1-ranked Oscar Wood of Oregon State at
149 pounds. Coufal, 10-4 on the season, used a first-period
takedown and later an escape and penalty calls to beat Wood 6-3.
</P>
<P>
   ``He likes to go with the upper body, so I tried to stay away
from him and use good fakes,'' Coufal said. ``He walked into my low
single.''
</P>
<P>
   CSUB heavyweight Stephen Neal, also ranked No. 1, went
unchallenged. The defending NCAA champion recorded three pins, the
longest taking 59 seconds, to win the meet's Outstanding Wrestler
Award.

NOLAN RYAN AWAITS HALL OF FAME VOTE
</HEADLINE>

c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Nolan Ryan fanned Rickey Henderson for his 5,000th career
strikeout, catcher Chad Kreuter jogged to the mound and handed him
the baseball.
</P>
<P>
   Ten years later, Ryan isn't really sure where that baseball is.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I had to lay my hands on it I guess I could,'' Ryan said.
``But it would take a little research.''
</P>
<P>
   Memorabilia collectors would love to get their hands on that
ball, but Ryan really isn't interested. The past holds little
appeal to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always been more concerned about the present and the
future,'' Ryan said. ``I tell people I didn't retire, I just
changed jobs. The new ones just don't pay as well as the old one.''
</P>
<P>
   Ryan retired five years ago from his old job of major-league
pitcher. He finds out Tuesday if he'll receive the ultimate reward
for those 27 distinguished years of service: enshrinement in the
Baseball Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   ``If that happens, it will be the final thing that wraps up my
career,'' Ryan said. ``Obviously it will be one of the greatest
things that ever happened to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Ryan's credentials are familiar to those who watched his odyssey
with the New York Mets, California Angels, Houston Astos and the
Rangers. He is baseball's all-time record holder with 5,714 career
strikeouts and seven no-hitters. His 324 career victories is tied
for 12th all-time with Don Sutton, already a member of the Hall of
Fame.
</P>
<P>
   This is Ryan's first year on the ballot, along with Royals third
baseman George Brett, Brewers shortstop//outfielder Robin Yount,
Red Sox//White Sox catcher Carlton Fisk and Braves outfielder Dale
Murphy. It is one of the most prestigious first-year ballots ever
presented to the baseball writers.
</P>
<P>
   Candidates must receive 75 percent of the total votes cast to
receive induction. Last year, 473 writers voted. Ryan and Brett are
considered the favorites for election this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess it comes down to each individual who votes and what
their criteria is,'' Ryan said. ``You look at some of the people in
the Hall and at their accomplishments and careers, I'd say yes.
Then you look at other people who are held in high esteem and you
feel you're not on a level at what they accomplished.''
</P>
<P>
   The Hall of Fame does not judge in that regard. There are no
gold, silver or platinum levels. Baseball's highest honor is a
simple matter _ you're either in or you're not.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan has been to Cooperstown twice, once while pitching with the
California Angels and again a few years later with the Astros.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can remember walking through there and thinking what an
honor it would be to be recognized with those fellows there,'' Ryan
said.
</P>
<P>
   But it was a rare thought. Ryan spends his time now running his
bank and ranches, serving with the Texas Parks and Wildlife
Department and buying a minor-league baseball team. He also does
endorsements and remains devoted to his family.
</P>
<P>
   He doesn't spend much time on the front-porch rocker, eagerly
anticipating Induction Day in Cooperstown.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's probably one of those things, if it happens, as time goes
on, it will become more special to you,'' Ryan said. ``It's kind of
like some of the things that happened in my career. The more time
elapses, the more you appreciate how special those things are.''
</P>
<P>
   Ryan always said that while he was playing. But five years
later, he is no more willing to reminisce than he was when he was
wearing the uniform.
</P>
<P>
   ``A guy walked into my office at the bank and said he was really
surprised there wasn't any baseball stuff in there,'' Ryan said.
``I said I guess you're right.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you asked me to give you probably three special moments,
obviously the 5,000th strikeout because there was a lot of
electricity in the air and the fan involvement and the buildup,
people getting so much involved. The seventh no-hitter I feel was
there because it was a special night and everything came together.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then there was the night Pete Rose tied the all-time National
League hit record and the next three times I struck him out. It was
an extremely difficult thing to do because he doesn't strike out
much. After the last at-bat, he slammed his bat on the ground and
broke it. Then as he got to the dugout, he turned around and
saluted me. There were some moments like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Ryan, much like Mark McGwire in his pursuit of baseball's
single-season home-run record, gets much more satisfaction talking
to fans who watched him play and hearing what his accomplishments
meant to them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get a lot of people telling me: I appreciated your effort,
and I got a lot of enjoyment out of watching you,'' Ryan said.
``Those things are what make you feel good, that people appreciated
your dedication and the way you conducted yourself, or something
you did was memorable in their lives. I get a lot of satisfaction
out of that.''
</P>
<P>
   Much more than sitting around and looking at a baseball Rickey
Henderson couldn't hit.

TEAMS UNLEASHING OFFENSIVE HOUNDS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE HEIKA 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   While NHL governors and general managers can alter the course of
the game over time with rule changes and mandates to referees,
there is no fraternity that can affect the on-ice product as
dramatically as the NHL coaches.
</P>
<P>
   And it appears the restless feelings fans and players have
experienced from suffocating defensive systems have finally
manifested itself in coaches. More and more, bench bosses are
tinkering with the idea that their teams can be more offensively
creative, that goal-scoring can lead to victories and that taking
some risks can produce big paydays.
</P>
<P>
   Although league scoring hasn't risen above last season's average
of 5.2 combined goals per game, a trend is afoot that signals more
offense. In places such as Toronto, New Jersey, Buffalo _ and yes,
even Dallas _ coaches who have all but perfected defensive systems
are now turning their talents to offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think you have to at some point,'' Maple Leafs general
manager Ken Dryden said. ``The league has gone through trends
throughout its existence, and there is always someone out there
trying to figure out a better way to do things.''
</P>
<P>
   In Toronto, that better way was to get a top-notch goalie in
free-agent Curtis Joseph and then let him help change the way the
team played. Joseph's numbers aren't spectacular _ 2.54 goals
against and .909 save percentage _ but his ability to stop prime
scoring chances on breakaways has allowed his teammates to be a
little more risky. The result? The Leafs are among the league
leaders in offense and also among the top five in victories.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our thought is, if you have a good goalie, why do all this
work to only let him face 20 shots a game,'' Dryden said. ``If you
have a good goalie, you have to trust him.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a dangerous philosophy, but it's working so far. Joseph is
7-0 in games in which he has faced 30 or more shots.
</P>
<P>
   The Buffalo Sabres have lived on that philosophy for the past
three seasons, taking offensive chances and allowing goalie Dominik
Hasek to clean up the mess. The result is the Sabres have been able
to develop five or six young forwards into dependable goal-scorers
</P>
<P>
   In New Jersey, rookie coach Robbie Ftorek has done much the same
thing. He hasn't completely released the Devils from their
defensive responsibilities, but he's allowing them to skate even if
it means goalie Martin Brodeur will see more prime scoring chances.
Brodeur's numbers have suffered, but the rest of the team is
excited about the chance to move the puck.
</P>
<P>
   And that might be the bottom line in the coaches' changing their
philosophy. Players generally will do whatever it takes to produce
a win, but they're much happier when they're allowed to skate, when
they're allowed to take chances, when they're allowed to be
creative. By loosening the reins, coaches can better motivate
entire teams, not just the scorers.
</P>
<P>
   And that makes it easier to get the players to ``buy into the
system.''
</P>
<P>
   Stars coach Ken Hitchcock is activating his team's defensemen,
allowing them to get more involved in the offensive play. And while
Craig Ludwig, Shawn Chambers and Richard Matvichuk might tell you
it's no big deal to score a goal, you can see their excitement when
they do.
</P>
<P>
   The NHL has been a copy-cat league in the past. When Bobby Orr
revolutionized the position of defenseman, every team tried to
copy. When small, skinny Wayne Gretzky stunned the league with
high-risk passing, every team tried to follow suit. When the
Panthers and Devils found instant success with team defense, many
teams jumped on board.
</P>
<P>
   Now, there's a trend toward getting offense back into the game,
and the coaches are endorsing it. That could be the real change the
league has been seeking for the past three seasons.
</P>
<P>
   SLAP SHOTS BIG BROTHER
</P>
<P>
   Anybody else worried about Colin Campbell's recent decision to
rescind a game-misconduct penalty against the Flyers' Eric Lindros?
The issue isn't whether Lindros deserved the penalty, it's that
Campbell was setting a bad precedent by second-guessing a referee.
</P>
<P>
   Lindros received a five-minute major for a slash on Chris
Chelios and a game misconduct. It was Lindros' second stick-related
game-misconduct, so an automatic one-game suspension was set to
follow. But Campbell reviewed the tape and rescinded the
game-misconduct.
</P>
<P>
   I'm all for review and proper discipline, but the referees have
to be allowed to run the game. If the league can reverse a judgment
call in that situation, why not just review every hook, hold or
offside call that could change a game.
POT O' TROUBLE
</P>
<P>
   No matter how strong-willed Canucks general manager Brian Burke
is, he has to see his refusal to trade holdout winger Pavel Bure is
hurting the Canucks. Last week, frustrated coach Mike Keenan waved
a white flag so prominently, it had to send shivers through his
team. With Bure in Belarus and Alexander Mogilny (knee) and Todd
Bertuzzi (leg) injured, Keenan admitted his team was going nowhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``They get tired of listening to you,'' Keenan said. ``They need
a kick start or a new coach. That's how you ignite a team.''
</P>
<P>
   Many insiders said Keenan and Burke couldn't work together, and
this might be the sign the relationship is close to cracking.
MENTAL BLOCK
</P>
<P>
   Need any more hints that Owen Nolan's confidence is completely
shot? The San Jose Sharks winger, who once was was so cocky he
called a hat-trick goal against Dominik Hasek in the 1997 All-Star
Game, couldn't even get a shot off on a recent penalty-shot
attempt.
</P>
<P>
   Nolan was awarded the shot in a 2-0 victory against the
Vancouver Canucks and skated at the net as if he didn't want the
puck. He eventually fumbled it away and then skated to the bench,
where he looked shaken.
</P>
<P>
   ``Owen is playing with no confidence,'' assistant coach Bernie
Nicholls told the ``San Francisco Examiner''.
GREATEST EVER?
</P>
<P>
   For five consecutive games during the Red Wings' recent losing
streak, legendary coach Scotty Bowman sent his assistants out to
speak to the media.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Bowman was sending a mesage to his team. Maybe he's still
suffering after-effects from heart surgery. Maybe he wants his
assistants to learn from the experience.
</P>
<P>
   But the view from here says it's a pretty classless move to
appear to duck the media at the first sign of trouble.
SEEING RED
</P>
<P>
   Stars coach Ken Hitchcock is vehemently opposed to removing the
center red line in order to allow more long passes and eventually
more breakaways. His reasoning is defenses would simply sit back,
and the game would slow down even more.
</P>
<P>
   NHL general managers watching the experiment at the World Junior
Championships in Winnipeg have seen the rule change fail.
THE BUZZ
EASTERN CONFERENCE
</P>
<P>
   Cheers to Flyers center Eric Lindros. Knowing the whole city of
Philadelphia revolves around his play, Lindros showed enough common
sense last week to sit out a couple of games after receiving a
concussion. Lindros apparently learned a few things from his
brother Brett, who had his career cut short by post-concussion
syndrome. ... The surprising Panthers are hoping for a boost this
week as injured forwards Dino Ciccarelli (back) and Chris Wells
(hernia) could be back in the lineup. ...They've tallied the
financial total of general manager Bobby Clarke's blunders in
Philadelphia. He has spent $18.1 million in bonuses on players no
longer there _ Chris Gratton, Paul Coffey and Pat Falloon. ...
Islanders goalie Tommy Salo (broken finger) has returned to
practice and could come back this week. ... Dominik Hasek is
playing the best goal in the history of the NHL and it's an even
greater accomplishment when you consider his wife has been battling
chronic back pain. It got so bad earlier in the season he had to
travel with her to the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota. ... Irony of the
Year: Paul Coffey being traded to the Carolina Hurricanes. Coffey
played briefly for the Hurricanes organization when it was the
Hartford Whalers three years ago, but demanded a trade to ``a more
competitive team.'' Isn't that like marrying the girl who stood you
up at the prom? WESTERN CONFERENCE:
</P>
<P>
   And you thought the Southeast was the NHL's worst division.
Think again. Not only does the Northwest not have a team with a
winning record, it doesn't have a team with a winning record on
home ice. The Stars start a run through the Northwest Division this
week and could be welcomed guests. The home rundown: Avalanche at
6-9-1, Oilers at 7-9, Canucks at 8-7-2 and Flames at 5-12-2. ...
Mighty Ducks winger Paul Kariya has quietly become a tougher
player. Bouncing back from a concussion that kept him out most of
last season, Kariya had 43 points through 34 games. ``He's not
taking anything from anybody. He's playing with passion,'' coach
Craig Hartsburg said. ``That's Paul, he wants to be the best
all-around player in the world.''... The Blues continue to search
for offense in the wake of injuries to Pierre Turgeon (broken hand)
and Geoff Courtnall (post concussion syndrome). At some point in
time, does this team have to look to a trade to spark the offense?
... When Todd Gill joined the Red Wings last week, he became the
fifth former Maple Leafs defenseman to play for the Red Wings in
the past two seasons. When they asked Gill what number he wanted,
he responded ``19'' _ the number of Red Wings captain Steve
Yzerman. When asked why he didn't just ask for Gordie Howe's No. 9,
Gill responded: ``There's joking and then there's
stupidity.''...Yanic Perreault was second on the Kings in
goal-scoring last season with 28 and has been a healthy scratch for
the past four games. The Canucks or Blues should look to pick up
this versatile center. ... The Blackhawks have seen improvement
from Doug Gilmour since coach Dirk Graham moved him to a line with
Alexei Zhamnov and Tony Amonte.

GINGRICH WARNS REPUB LICANS TO HEED ELECTION RESULTS

<P>
   Departing House Speaker Newt Gingrich warned Saturday night that
Republicans could wake up after Election Day 2000 to find Al Gore
their president and Democrats the majority party if they don't heed
the wake-up call sent by voters in November.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are a very, very, dismal distance from where we should
be,'' Gingrich told the crowd of more than 200 conservatives
gathered at the posh Arizona Biltmore for the third annual
Repubican gathering, ``The Weekend.''
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich said the GOP party had lost its message, focus and
teamwork in 1998. But he added that it was not too late to turn the
party around, even as he steps aside from the speakership.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech that began and ended with standing ovations, and was
punctuated with chants of ``Newt!'' whistles and sporadic applause,
Gingrich told Republicans to stop focusing so much on Washington
and to focus instead on what the American people want.
</P>
<P>
   And what the public wants, he said, is more money in their
pockets in the form of lower taxes.
</P>
<P>
   `If we're not the anti-tax party . . . we have no right to be on
the ballot,'' he said, to a rousing ovation. ``No American should
pay more than 25 percent of their paycheck in taxes.''
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich recommended the party put a 25-percent cap on federal,
state and local taxes combined, though he conceded that it may take
decades to reach that goal.
</P>
<P>
   He also urged party leaders to create personal social security
funds for Americans, promote private school vouchers and charter
school options for disadvantaged children, and introduce new
``common sense'' litigation reform.
</P>
<P>
   Despite lackluster returns for the Republicans in the 1998
elections, Gingrich said he was optimistic. He told Republicans it
was not too late _ nor too unrealistic _ to prepare for
``astonishing'' successes in the presidential and congressional
elections of 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich declined to comment on rumors he may run for president.
But he may have hinted at his own political ambitions when he said
the question was not whether the Republicans would win again, ``but
how rapidly we will succeed.''
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich added, ``The struggle for freedom is endless. You can
never say `Well, now we have won.' ''

THOUSANDS GREET CARDINALS AT AIRPORT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JENNIFER BARRETT  
 and RICHARD RUELAS  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Cardinals! Cardinals! Cardinals!''
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 14,000 ecstatic fans staged a raucous party at Sky
Harbor International Airport on Saturday night to greet the
conquering heroes hours after the team's 20-7 trouncing of the
Dallas Cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want Jake! We want Jake! We want Jake!'' they shrieked as
the Arizona Cardinals, fresh from their first playoff victory in 51
years, descended from the plane about 9:45 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   The red birds now go on to face the Minnesota Vikings in
Minneapolis on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   And when quarterback Jake Plummer stepped up to the lectern on
the tarmac, he thrilled the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is awesome,'' Plummer said. ``The energy we feel here now
we felt in Dallas. Without you guys believing in us we couldn't
have gotten it done.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, making a reference to a line from the movie ``The
Waterboy,'' he said, ``It's been a saying for us for the last few
weeks: We can do it!''
</P>
<P>
   That brought more cheers and clapping from the faithful, who
came from as far away as Chandler and New River, babies on their
daddies' shoulders, college students and retirees. They were pumped
up from the amazing upset that naysayers said would never happen.
</P>
<P>
   It was like a block party, with spontaneous cheering, pickup
football games, and a band playing rock and roll songs. Deejay Rich
Creeger of KSLX-FM (100.7) revved up the crowd and Cardinals
cheerleaders danced around.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll have to find out where the hell is Minnesota,'' said
Linda Zacchia, 52, of Phoenix, a pediatric nurse, referring to the
Cardinals' match next Sunday against the mighty Vikings.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been five years of tough seasons but I've been with them,
whatever. I love them,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Rory Rainstorn of Phoenix was dancing with his 4-year-old son,
Michael.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't feel they had it in the bag until about 15 seconds
left in the game,'' he said. ``I kept waiting for the other shoe to
drop, for Dallas to treat us like they always do, but that never
happened.''
</P>
<P>
   There was whistling, hooting, clapping and waving flags. Air
horns cut the din.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Handmade signs proclaimed, ``You've got to believe,'' and ``We
knew.'' A band played Cardinals parody songs, like, ``Jake Don't be
a Hero,'' and ``Nowhere'' ``Team,'' referring to the Cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   All eyes peered skyward as the vigil continued, and when the
plane flew into view, an illuminated cardinal on its tail, people
went wild.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just hope that when the team falls on hard times again, all
these fans will come out,'' said Jeff Grachus, 27, of Phoenix,
wearing a Plummer jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the Valley, fans cheered from their living rooms,
automobiles, parties and bars as the Cardinals surprised the
nation.
</P>
<P>
   At Player's All-American Sports Bar, it sounded like New Year's
Eve all over again. The rowdy crowd gathered around a big-screen
television on the patio and counted down the final seconds in
unison, ``10 _ 9 _ 8 _ 7 . . .''
</P>
<P>
   But fans erupted early into applause, knocking empty beer
pitchers to the ground and high-fiving and hugging total strangers
_ well, as long as they were wearing red.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, those in the silver and blue tried to slip out
quietly from the eatery in Phoenix's Arizona Center. Not all were
so lucky.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today I'm a loser,'' admitted Dallas fan Aaron Carillo, 38,
who lost a six-pack to some Cardinals fans, but kept his faith in
the Cowboys. ``I've always been a fan, although I'm playing it a
little low-key today.''
</P>
<P>
   Carillo, who had driven to Phoenix from his home in Santa Fe,
N.M., to welcome in the new year and watch the game with his
Phoenix friends, counts among his Cowboys gear: a logo leather
jacket and travel bag, six pairs of shorts, and at least 20
T-shirts _ the most inconspicuous of which he wore Saturday. The
grey T-shirt showed a football ripping apart the words ``Dallas
Cowboys.''
</P>
<P>
   That's what the Cardinals did to the team on the field as well.
</P>
<P>
   Don Cruz, a security guard at AMC Arizona Center movie theater,
watched the television screen from the atrium of the Arizona
Center. When the Cowboys scored, he whipped out a hand-held radio
and dutifully reported the score to other staff members at the
theater.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're slow over there,'' he said. ``Everyone's watching the
ball game.''
</P>
<P>
   Ticket taker Albert Orta, 16, said the theater's staff kept the
breakroom radio tuned to the game as well, sneaking in for periodic
updates.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we managed to do our jobs as well,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Next weekend, he has taken off so he can watch the game
uninterrupted. The Cardinals will face the Vikings on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Amy Cruz, 25, was reporting the score to friends as well via
cellular phone, but she wasn't smiling.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was about ready to kill those guys behind us,'' she said,
tugging at her Cowboys game shirt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been a Cowboys fan for as long as I can remember,'' added
Cruz, a native Texan and Phoenix resident. ``The Cardinals have
been here for 10 years and no one cared and now suddenly, they have
two sold out games, and they're like, `The Cowboys suck.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Friend and fellow Cowboys fan, Jennifer Thomasson, 24, said she
was willing to wager that at least half the red-shirted fans had
Dallas Cowboys shirts in their closets.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could still see the creases in some of their (Cardinals)
shirts. I bet it's the first time they've worn them.''

proudly. ``The Cowboys haven't been doing well lately, but I'm

   Jennifer Ems, 21, said she is going to wear her shirt proudly as
well _ her Cardinals shirt, that is. She admits it's been awhile
since she wore it out in public.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been embarrassing,'' she said. ``Every time the Cowboys
came here, they beat us, but to see them (Cardinals) totally
slaughter the Cowboys _ well, we don't have to be embarrassed
anymore to be Cardinals fans.''

UCLA DEFEATS   ARIZONA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ With their archrival on the court and their former
teammates hovering in a near corner, the new-era UCLA Bruins
unofficially severed all ties to their recent past.
</P>
<P>
   Kris Johnson, Toby Bailey and Jelani McCoy watched from a corner
of Pauley Pavilion as Baron Davis and friends delivered the most
spirited and significant win of the season _ an 82-75 victory over
No. 6 Arizona in the Pac-10 opener for both teams.
</P>
<P>
   The new era officially began in November, of course, but until
Saturday night these Bruins had nothing of consequence to call
their own.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the game that starts our climb to the Pac-10 title,''
UCLA junior forward Sean Farnham said. ``It's the most important
game on the schedule.''
</P>
<P>
   UCLA never trailed and never relented, charging to a 20-point
second-half lead and repelling a late Wildcats rally.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins played with hyper-aggression, challenging every pass
and every rebound. Some of it was wasted motion, to be sure. But
where previous Arizona teams were savvy and talented enough to
counteract UCLA's energy, these Wildcats had no answers.
</P>
<P>
   Freshman forward Michael Wright often was one man against five.
Arizona's freshman guards seemed paralyzed by the intensity of
their first conference road game, and the Wildcats' seniors, A.J.
Bramlett and Jason Terry, were ineffective until the final minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Trailing 61-40, the Wildcats pulled to single digits with three
minutes remaining. They were within 81-75 with 20 seconds left when
a botched possession ended their comeback.
</P>
<P>
   The No. 10 Bruins beat Arizona to every loose ball and seemed to
be in two places at once, so much quicker were they. For both teams
the ballhandling was sloppy and the pace frenzied. That combination
created the type of playground atmosphere UCLA has thrived in for
years.
</P>
<P>
   Whether it's Bailey or Davis, the Bruins always have _ and
always will _ prefer warp speed.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the top-10 rankings, the matchup lacked the national
significance of the UCLA-Arizona collisions throughout the '90s.
Neither team is expected to challenge for a high NCAA Tournament
seed or the Pac-10 title; that is Stanford's domain until proven
otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, though, the pressure was on UCLA. Because road wins
will be scarce, the Bruins must protect their homecourt like a
small child. For confidence and momentum purposes, as well, they
viewed Saturday as critical to their long-term success.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is definitely a message-type game,'' Bruins guard Rico
Hines said. ``It's a chance to set the tone for the season.''
</P>
<P>
   The Wildcats and Bruins entered the game as equals in youth and
(questionable) credentials. UCLA faced its toughest foes in
November and hadn't been challenged since Oklahoma State four weeks
ago. However, Arizona's schedule featured a slew of lightweights,
and that inexperienced showed in the early going as the Bruins
jumped to a 13-4 lead.
</P>
<P>
   The margin was a slight surprise considering UCLA's starting
lineup. Reserves Farnham, Rico Hines and Travis Reed started
because they were fit for practice Thursday, whereas Jerome Moiso
and Dan Gadzuric apparently were not. Frustrated, coach Steve Lavin
hauled the Bruins into the locker room and declared: ``The five
guys who practiced are starting.''
</P>
<P>
   Earl Watson and Davis controlled the pace from the outset. Davis
opened the game with a 3-pointer from the left wing, Watson found
Farnham for a layup, then buried a 3-pointer himself for an 8-2.
</P>
<P>
   The momentum shifted several times early in the first half _
UCLA pulling to eight- and 10-points leads, then Arizona edging
close.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins made their first big push with eight minutes left,
when Reed converted back-to-back layins. On the next possession,
one of UCLA's best, Ryan Bailey sliced through the defense and
passed to a hard-charging Matt Barnes for a layup. A few seconds
later, Bailey drained a 3-pointer from the right wing, then Moiso
canned a difficult turnaround to give the Bruins a 32-19 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Moiso struck again with 2:15 left, hitting a 3-pointer from the
top of the key as the shot clock expired. Watson scored on a leaner
from the right side for a 16-point lead.

NORTHRIDGE RUNS OUT OF STEAM
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   FLAGSTAFF, Ariz. _ Some of the reasoning may have centered
around the exertion of energy needed to come back from a 20-point
deficit in the second half.
</P>
<P>
   Another factor may have been the 7,000-foot altitude of Walkup
Skydome, which winds a person just walking up the stairs. Imagine
the effect it has on a basketball player not used to the
conditions.
</P>
<P>
   However, Cal State Northridge coach Bobby Braswell would have
none of that after the Matadors were blitzed in overtime Saturday
and fell to defending Big Sky champ Northern Arizona 96-79 in the
league opener.
</P>
<P>
   Ross Land scored five of his game-high 23 points in overtime,
when the Matadors were outscored 21-4.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boy, we laid a big egg in overtime,'' Braswell said. ``We came
out and they took it to us.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here's my take on (fatigue). When you have a chance to win a
basketball game, and you've got five minutes to go in overtime,
fatigue makes cowards of us all. You either give in to fatigue, or
you say, `I've got plenty of time to rest tonight. I've got five
minutes to win a basketball game.' That's hopefully what they
learned.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lumberjacks, winners of 20 straight at home, scored 18 of
the final 21 points while the defensive intensity that allowed CSUN
(8-5, 0-1 Big Sky) to force the extra session disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think (past success) has something to do with this,''
Lumberjacks coach Ben Howland said. ``Our guys expect to win. They
know they're going to win. That's a sign of a good team.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a game Braswell put a lot of stock into, and it should be
interesting to see how CSUN rebounds for its conference home opener
Monday against Idaho State.
</P>
<P>
   The Matadors came to Arizona on Thursday so not be distracted by
the New Year's holiday, and to get accustomed to the surroundings.
</P>
<P>
   The significance was to use Northern Arizona as a barometer for
where the Matadors stand in the conference. The Lumberjacks (9-3)
won back-to-back league titles and went to the NCAAs last season.
And with most of that team back, the Lumberjacks are overwhelming
picks to win the conference again.
</P>
<P>
   But CSUN's improbable second-half comeback was overshadowed by
the ending.
</P>
<P>
   ``We get outscored 21-4 in overtime, that's not acceptable,''
said CSUN power forward Rico Harris, who scored 16 of his 21 points
after halftime. ``No excuses. They outworked us. We had a chance to
actually win and we let up. We had an opportunity, played hard,
came back and overtime it seemed like we let up.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the Matadors were brutal in overtime, but it was an
extra five minutes that shouldn't have existed.
</P>
<P>
   If the Matadors played as strong and tenacious on defense during
the first 25 minutes, they never would have trailed 54-34 early in
the second half.
</P>
<P>
   And if Northern Arizona didn't melt in its prosperity, Derrick
Higgins' 3-pointer from the corner with 26.3 seconds left in
regulation wouldn't have meant a darn thing. Instead, it tied the
score at 75-75, and overtime was forced when Land's 3-point attempt
at the buzzer fell short.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had momentum,'' a disgusted Higgins said. ``We're in shape.
It had nothing to do with the altitude.''
</P>
<P>
   By the time CSUN regained its bearings from the frantic finish
of regulation, Northern Arizona had scored a pair of easy baskets
and made four foul shots to take an 86-77 lead with 2:28 left.
After a follow of a missed shot by CSUN's Jeff Parris, the
Lumberjacks scored the last 11 points.
</P>
<P>
   ``You saw our guys jumping up and celebrating going into
overtime and I think we thought that was it,'' Braswell said. ``We
got to overtime and (Northern Arizona) was going to fold. There's a
reason they're champions, a reason they won the championship two
years in a row. They know how to get through adversity, and,
obviously, we haven't learned to deal with that yet.''

JOHNSON'S PLAY A WELCOME SIGHT FOR KINGS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROGER PHILLIPS  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ Kings enforcer Matt Johnson will never
develop into a 40-goal scorer in the NHL. But in Wednesday night's
victory over San Jose, Johnson scored his second goal of the season
with the type of play opposing teams would be hard-pressed to stop.
</P>
<P>
   The 6-foot-5 Johnson gained body position on Sharks defenseman
Bob Rouse _ a large player himself at 6-2 _ in front of the San
Jose net and had only to get his stick on a centering pass from Ian
Laperriere to deflect the puck past goalie Mike Vernon.
</P>
<P>
   Kings coach Larry Robinson said if Johnson wants to make an
impact in the NHL beyond the reputation he's gained as a fighter,
plays such as the one he made against San Jose will have to appear
more frequently in his repertoire.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to kind of compare Matty to a Bob Probert (of
Chicago) or a Donald Brashear (of Vancouver),'' Robinson said. ``In
order to play now, you have to do more than just fight. If he wants
to model himself after anyone, those are two guys who worked to get
better.''
</P>
<P>
   Of Johnson's goal against San Jose, Robinson said, ``That's
size, and getting the right position. If you know what to do with
the puck, that's a pretty big mountain to move.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson had six goals and 599 penalty minutes in 151 NHL games
before Saturday's game against Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   !arrow!Aching Avs: &UR; !off! &LR;  Colorado center Joe Sakic returned to
the lineup after missing seven games with a sprained shoulder, but
the Avalanche remains without defenseman Alexei Gusarov (broken
finger), goalie Patrick Roy (sprained knee) and wingers Shjon
Podein (fractured leg), Warren Rychel (broken hand) and Jon Klemm
(torn patella tendon).
</P>
<P>
   Roy is doubtful for Colorado's game Monday night against his
former team, the Montreal Canadiens. After a slow start, Roy had
regained his form before being injured eight days ago against
Dallas. He owns a 10-12-3 record with a 2.28 goals-against average,
two shutouts and a 91.2 save percentage.
</P>
<P>
   The Avalanche has lost 167 games to injury this season, two more
than the Kings.
</P>
<P>
   Loose pucks: Winger Steve McKenna, sidelined with an abdominal
strain, will undergo abdominal surgery Monday and is expected to be
sidelined at least two more months.... Defenseman Doug Bodger
missed his second game with the cervical strain and bruised
shoulder he suffered Monday when checked from behind by Phoenix's
Dallas Drake, who received a four-game suspension from the NHL for
the hit. Bodger is receiving electrical stimulation on the injured
area. He had said Friday morning that he generally wakes up feeling
sore and gets better as the day progresses. That wasn't the case
Friday. ``It was a bad day,'' Bodger said. ``He's going to miss
four games and I may miss five.''... Former Mighty Ducks coach
Pierre Page scouted the game for the Nashville Predators.

UCLA'S ROOKIES GIVE VETERAN EFFORT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  
 &HT;     By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ If Steve Lavin had been coaching the UCLA football
team during Friday's Rose Bowl, we're pretty sure he would have
started Vae Tata and Cheyane Caldwell on defense. It might not have
changed the game's outcome any, but at least there would have been
no questioning anybody's effort.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it is dawning on the players that Lavin demands it, but
whatever the reason the Bruins' effort at both ends of the floor in
their Pacific-10 opener against Arizona Saturday night was very
crisp. Indeed, No.10 UCLA ironed out enough of the wrinkles that
had surfaced in the second half of a loss to Maryland, for example,
and in both halves of a win over American University to upset the
previously unbeaten Wildcats, 82-75.
</P>
<P>
   It was a huge win for the Bruins (9-2) _ who lost both games to
Arizona last season and one of two the season before _ and one
small victory for Lavin. If there's one thing the Bruins'
third-year head basketball coach hates worse than an unpressed
dress shirt it's a practice without a lot of starch in it. On New
Year's Eve, Lavin didn't like the unfastidious play of some of his
would-be starters.
</P>
<P>
   So guess what? When the Bruins tipped off against the
sixth-ranked Wildcats, freshman Jerome Moiso was on the bench, just
like classmate JaRon Rush, who was in street clothes after missing
two practices and one game earlier in the week while in the throes
of homesickness.
</P>
<P>
   You could be cynical and say that by benching Rush _ the squad's
third-leading scorer _ for all of the Arizona game, Lavin was
providing the Bruins with a handy alibi in the event the game went
badly.
</P>
<P>
   But then you see that walk-on Sean Farnham has been inserted
into the starting lineup against a perennial Pac-10 power in a game
the Bruins absolutely, positively needed to take control of from
the opening tipoff and you have to say this for Lavin: he's as
dogged as Paul Revere in delivering his message of accountability.
</P>
<P>
   Moiso, whose spot in the opening lineup Farnham took, seemed to
get the word. He spelled the junior a little more than three
minutes into the game _ the Bruins already were ahead 13-4 with one
of the baskets coming from Farnham _ and accounted for 12 of the
Bruins' final 27 points in the half.
</P>
<P>
   He would finish with a team-high 21 points and eight rebounds
and then acknowledge, ``I took the lesson (Lavin) sent. I was ready
to play.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor was there any hint of a limp or lethargy from Dan Gadzuric.
If the tendinitis in both his knees was bothering him, the
6-foot-10 freshman center sure didn't show any signs of it. He was
a pain in the paint for the Wildcats at both ends of the court and
the way he ran down loose balls you would have thought his name was
Gazelle.
</P>
<P>
   The Wildcats (8-1) have a wonderful freshman class of their own
and coach Lute Olson, like Lavin, went to them early. Before the
game was eight minutes old there were six freshmen sharing the
court. The only place you're likely to see that many freshmen on
one floor is on the Tuesday primetime drama, ``Felicity.''
</P>
<P>
   Arizona first-year player Michael Wright didn't do a whole lot
wrong. He finished with 14 points and his classmate Ruben Douglas,
who attended Bell-Jeff High, added 11.
</P>
<P>
   But Round One of a dogfight that should get even scrappier in
the months and years to come clearly belonged to Moiso, Gadzuric,
Ray Young and Matt Barnes, even if they did combine to outscore the
Wildcats' freshmen by only one (36-35).
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins' freshmen brought a lot more energy to the task,
which is to be expected given that they had a rowdy home crowd to
feed off of. And yet, even in the final seconds when it got as
quiet as it did all night because the Wildcats were finishing with
a flurry, Moiso showed no dropoff in his energy level.
</P>
<P>
   He outbattled Wildcats freshman Richard Jefferson for the game's
last rebound to stifle Arizona's surge. No sooner had his sneakers
touched back down on the court than the Pauley Pavilion crowd of
11,453 started serenading Arizona with an exuberant ``Overrated.''
</P>
<P>
   Funny, but that's pretty much the same thing Arizona coach Lute
Olson had been screaming to anyone who would listen in the days
leading up to the game.
</P>
<P>
   He called the Wildcats' national ranking ``a joke'' because they
hadn't played any quality opponents. UCLA wanted to make darn sure
the Wildcats wouldn't be able to say that today. &QL;

`WE'RE HERE': CARDS' WIN WONDROUS

<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ How long did you hold your breath? &QL; 
Did you turn Cardinals red, then metallic blue?
</P>
<P>
   When did you finally quit watching the clock and wringing your
hands and realize that oh, my goodness, bless their hearts, they're
really going to do it?
</P>
<P>
   Go on, e-x-h-a-l-e.
</P>
<P>
   Now, breathe in. Deeply. Fill your lungs with the fresh clean
air of a new era.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're new. We're here,'' Jake Plummer said, coining the motto
and battle cry of a young and resourceful team that Saturday
finally and convincingly beat the Dallas Cowboys and gave the Wild
Cards their first NFL playoff victory in 51 seasons.
</P>
<P>
   To save you figuring the math, the year was 19-and-47.
</P>
<P>
   Harry Truman was president.
</P>
<P>
   Jackie Robinson broke into the major leagues.
</P>
<P>
   Al Capone died.
</P>
<P>
   Informed of this historical footnote, Lomas Brown, who dressed
after the game in a chalk-striped suit like one Scarface might have
been buried in, looked around the locker room. A room which for so
many years was the Cardinals concrete tomb.
</P>
<P>
   Lomas took in the happy faces. He repeated the score, 20-7,
tasting it, turning it over on his tongue like a candy mint. He
felt the love. He breathed in, savoring the aroma of Jamir Miller's
ridiculous foot-long cigar.
</P>
<P>
   ``I bet Al turned over today,'' Brown said.
</P>
<P>
   Nineteen forty-seven.
</P>
<P>
   Cardinals owner Bill Bidwill was 16 years old when the family
franchise won the title. Bidwill worked the game as a water boy.
</P>
<P>
   Know what movie won the Oscar for best screenplay in '47? ``The
Miracle on'' ``34th Street.'' If pounding the Cowboys in the
playoffs at Texas Stadium _ next week it's on to Minnesota _
doesn't qualify as a miracle, it's at least a wondrous achievement.
The Cards hadn't won here since 1989. They had lost to the Cowboys
16 of 17 times _ twice this season.
</P>
<P>
   But here's a stat for you. Since trailing Dallas 28-0 in that
Nov. 15 game in Tempe, the Cardinals outscored the NFC East
champions, 48-14.
</P>
<P>
   Las Vegas mathematicians said this wasn't supposed to happen.
Most prognosticators figured the Cardinals would come in and behave
like wide-eyed novices who were just happy to be here.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys had playoff experience; the Cards didn't. The
Cowboys had Troy Aikman and Emmitt Smith and Michael Irvin and yes,
Deion Sanders, whose injured big toe apparently and miraculously
healed overnight, for there he was starting at cornerback after a
six-week absence. For Dallas fans, his return was reassuring.
</P>
<P>
   Then the game started.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Bidwill carried the water in '47. This time the Cardinals
defense did. Aeneas Williams intercepted two Aikman passes. Tommy
Bennett got got the third. Rookie Corey Chavous, making only his
fifth start, played the game of his life. The secondary's pass
coverage was tighter than Deion's blue do-rag.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals shut out the Cowboys for 56{ minutes, and one play
in particular characterized the defense's tenacity and resolve. In
the second quarter with the Cards leading 7-0, Dallas gambled on
fourth-and-one from the Arizona seven. Linebacker Mark Maddox
dropped Smith for a one-yard loss. The crowd groaned like an old
mattress. Later, restless fans began to boo. Eventually, most
headed for the aisles, and drifted off silently into the cold
night.
</P>
<P>
   Nineteen forty-seven.
</P>
<P>
   The date means nothing to players named Plummer and Sanders and
Murrell. They live in the present and play for the moment, and all
three contributed in a big way.
</P>
<P>
   There was Plummer throwing downfield to Sanders, who reached up
with his right hand like an outfielder and brought the ball down,
never breaking stride _ a 59-yard play. There was Plummer
delivering a shovel pass to Adrian Murrell, which worked like a
charm for the Cards' first touchdown. Perfect call.
</P>
<P>
   Murrell wasn't finished. In the third period, he popped through
the line like a champagne cork. His 74-yard run was the Cardinals'
longest play of the season, and it led to a touchdown and a 17-0
lead.
</P>
<P>
   How good did this feel? The game over, Larry Centers reached out
and grabbed a TV crew's boom mike. Drawing its fuzzy caterpillar
cover to his face, he closed his eyes and playfully rubbed it
against his cheek.
</P>
<P>
   Center Mike Devlin smiled at a family photo taped to his
cubicle. Devlin's dad died last year. For every Cardinals game,
home and away, Devlin has purchased one ticket. There was one empty
seat at Texas Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``My father,'' Devlin said, ``had the best seat in the house.''
</P>
<P>
   John Omohundro wasn't with the Cardinals in 1947. But he's been
with the team since 1966. As trainer, he knows better than anyone
the pain of losing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a long, long time,'' Omohundro said, eyes shining
with joy.
</P>
<P>
   Yes. Is this worth it?
</P>
<P>
   Omohundro nodded.
</P>
<P>
   ``The longer the wait,'' he said, ``the sweeter the wine.'' &QL;

MURRAY HURT IN KINGS' VICTORY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROGER PHILLIPS  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD _ It had been a virtual morgue as recently as one week
earlier, but as Saturday night began, the Forum was as lively as it
had been all season, with the Kings leading _ and dominating _ the
Colorado Avalanche.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings were in control, and now, right wing Glen Murray, the
team's second-leading scorer and best all-around forward, was using
a burst of speed to beat Avalanche defenseman Aaron Miller to a
loose puck deep in Colorado's zone.
</P>
<P>
   When they reached the puck, Miller hit Murray with a clean, hard
check, riding him into the end boards. But the landing was a bad
one. Murray came down awkwardly, his right leg bent behind him,
with Miller on top.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, 12:48 into a game that had begun so well for the
Kings, the liveliness of the Forum crowd of 13,553 was replaced by
silence, by the sight of Murray screaming in pain and banging the
boards with his hands, and by the realization that on a night when
the Kings were on their way to a 4-2 victory, they had suffered yet
another serious injury to a key player.
</P>
<P>
   It's been the story of their season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes you sick to your stomach when you see a guy hurt like
that,'' center Ray Ferraro said later, after scoring the Kings'
first and third goals.
</P>
<P>
   Murray _ who has 15 goals, 13 assists and 28 points, second on
the team in all categories to Luc Robitaille _ suffered a severe
sprain of the medial collateral ligament in his right knee.
</P>
<P>
   After being examined on the ice by team physician Dr. Ronald
Kvitne, Murray was removed by stretcher and taken to Centinela
Hospital Medical Center. Initial X-rays were negative, and Murray
was scheduled to undergo a magnetic resonance imaging examination
late Saturday night. It was not clear how long Murray would be
sidelined.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no doubt about it, it's devastating,'' coach Larry
Robinson said. ``But losing two starting goaltenders and Rob Blake
was devastating, as well. We've still got games to play. All we can
hope is that it's not that serious and he's back soon.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Blake, who missed 15 games earlier this season with a
broken foot: ``We've got a major hurdle with Muzz going out. That's
our best player right now. We can't afford to lose a guy like that.
You can't replace what he does for us.''
</P>
<P>
   The injury to Murray comes at a time when the Kings, who won for
the fifth time in their last six games and have won three games in
a row for the first time this season, appeared to have put behind
them the injury hex of the season's first three months.
</P>
<P>
   After struggling to score goals in the early part of the year,
the Kings' offense _ which had consisted of Murray, Robitaille and
not much else _ has become more balanced recently. And Saturday's
victory over the Avalanche (16-18-3) marked the sixth consecutive
game in which the Kings (13-21-3) have allowed two or fewer goals.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings went ahead for good 2:40 into the game when defenseman
Mark Visheau fired the puck from the right point, and Ferraro
deflected it past Colorado goalie Craig Billington.
</P>
<P>
   Five minutes later, Robitaille scored on a power play, the 497th
goal of his career and his team-high 19th goal this season, three
more than he scored in 1997-98.
</P>
<P>
   Ferraro scored the lone goal of the second period, off a
goalmouth scramble at 8:29. Jozef Stumpel made it 4-0 early in the
third period, and Chris Drury and Adam Foote scored late for the
Avalanche, wrecking Jamie Storr's shutout bid.
</P>
<P>
   But Murray's injury took much of the luster off the Kings'
latest strong effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was no dirty hit,'' Robinson said. ``It was just the way he
went in. Murray kind of lost his balance and went down funny.
(After the play) both sides took some time to recover.''
</P>
<P>
   It remains to be seen how long it will take the Kings to recover
from their latest setback.

UCLA BEATS ARIZONA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   With their archrivals on the court and their former teammates
hovering nearby, the new-era UCLA Bruins severed the final ties to
their past in crowded, energized Pauley Pavilion on Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   Kris Johnson, Toby Bailey and Jelani McCoy watched from a corner
of the arena as Baron Davis and friends delivered their most
significant win of the season _ an 82-75 victory over No. 6 Arizona
that was far more convincing than the score indicated.
</P>
<P>
   The new era officially began in November, of course, but until
Saturday night these Bruins had nothing of consequence to call
their own _ nothing to stand atop their fledgling resume in big,
bold print.
</P>
<P>
   ``This game pushes us over the top,'' Davis said. ``It's a win
over a top-10 team, which we didn't have until this point. To get
that under our belt will really give us confidence for the rest of
the season.''
</P>
<P>
   No. 10 UCLA never trailed _ charging to a 20-point lead in the
second half, then repelling a late Arizona rally. The Bruins (9-2,
1-0) played with hyper-aggression not seen this season. Some of it
was wasted motion, to be sure. But where previous Arizona teams
were savvy and talented enough to counteract UCLA's energy, these
Wildcats had no answers.
</P>
<P>
   Freshman forward Michael Wright (14 points, 10 rebounds) often
was one man against five as Arizona's freshman guards were
paralyzed by the intensity of their first conference road game.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the first half, they played like they were scared to
death,'' Wildcats coach Lute Olson said.
</P>
<P>
   His seniors, A.J. Bramlett and Jason Terry, were ineffective
until the late going. Terry, perhaps the best guard in the Pac-10,
finished with 19 points, but nine came in the last, desperate five
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Trailing 61-40, the Wildcats pulled within single digits with
three minutes remaining. They were within 81-75 with 20 seconds
left when a botched possession ended their comeback.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to get the ball out of Terry's hands and make the
other guys beat us,'' UCLA coach Steve Lavin said.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins beat Arizona to every loose ball and seemed to be in
two places at once, so much quicker were they. For both teams the
ballhandling was sloppy and the pace frenzied. That combination
created the type of playground atmosphere UCLA has thrived in for
years.
</P>
<P>
   But these Bruins not only played like previous editions, they
played for them.
</P>
<P>
   ``It meant a lot to us to see Kris, Jelani and Toby over there
and to beat Arizona for them,'' guard Rico Hines said. ``We know
how much they hate Arizona. We gave those guys something they
didn't get last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a statement game.''
</P>
<P>
   No one represents the changing dynamics of UCLA _ and this
rivalry _ better than the Bruins' freshman forward, Jerome Moiso. A
native of Guadeloupe who was educated in France, Moiso knows little
of the passion play that defined the Arizona-UCLA series throughout
the decade.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not really into those feelings,'' Moiso said.
</P>
<P>
   But the Bruins made him aware of the importance of Saturday's
game, and he responded with a game-high 21 points, making 7 of 11
shots and grabbing eight rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I played confident today,'' he said. ``Coming from the bench,
I knew I had to bring more energy.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins played without suspended forward JaRon Rush, who is
expected back for Monday's game against Arizona State. In addition,
Moiso and center Dan Gadzuric began the game on the bench after
they missed Thursday's practice. Sean Farnham made his first-ever
start, joining Hines, Travis Reed, Earl Watson and Davis to form
UCLA's oldest _ and most unusual _ lineup of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to send a message to the players,'' Lavin said.
``We're 14 deep, and you've got to play hard every day. Farnham and
Hines have such a great work ethic on a daily basis, I thought it
was important to reward them.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was also our oldest (lineup), with four sophomores and a
junior. For a conference game, they understood the level of
intensity, and it gave the other guys a chance to watch.''
</P>
<P>
   The Wildcats and Bruins entered the game as equals in youth and
questionable credentials. UCLA faced its toughest foes in November
and hadn't been challenged since Oklahoma State four weeks ago.
However, Arizona's schedule featured a slew of lightweights, and
that inexperience showed in the early going as the Bruins jumped to
a 13-4 lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't play like an Arizona team in the first half,'' Olson
said.
</P>
<P>
   The momentum shifted several times in the opening minutes _ UCLA
pulling to eight- and 10-points leads, then Arizona edging close.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins made their first big push with eight minutes left,
when Reed converted back-to-back layins. On the next possession,
one of UCLA's best, Ryan Bailey sliced through the defense and
passed to a hard-charging Matt Barnes for a layup. A few seconds
later, Bailey drained a 3-pointer from the right wing, then Moiso
canned a difficult turnaround to give the Bruins a 32-19 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Moiso struck again with 2:15 left, hitting a 3-pointer from the
top of the key as the shot clock expired. Watson scored on a leaner
from the right side for a 16-point lead.

ASU WOMEN FALL TO TROJANS  
 REBOUNDING IS KEY FOR USC 
</HEADLINE>
 STATE-AZR   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF METCALFE  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Theresa Jantzen and Leah Combs had not yet turned 2 when Arizona
State last won a women's basketball game over Southern California
at home.
</P>
<P>
   If either of the 18-year-old freshmen posts were healthy enough
to play Saturday, that losing streak might have ended. Instead, USC
used a 23-14 advantage on the offensive boards, and Coach Chris
Gobrecht's familiar defensive intensity to win, 67-54, in the
Pac-10 opener for both teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``We gave up the weak-side board all game,'' ASU Coach Charli
Turner Thorne said. ``It pains me to no end to watch the display of
rebounding we gave. If you take away the second shots, we win by 10
to 15 points.''
</P>
<P>
   With the 6-foot-2 Combs, the Pac-10's fourth-leading rebounder
(9.5 per game), on crutches because of stress fractures in both
legs and the 6-3 Jantzen limited to warm-ups as she recovers from a
fractured left foot, ASU opened in a zone to stay with the athletic
Trojans.
</P>
<P>
   USC shot 39.5 percent in the first half and even lower (34.4) in
the second, when the Sun Devils went to a man-to-man defense. ASU
made the change after trailing, 36-24, at halftime, the result of
USC's 15-6 edge in offensive rebounds and 16 ASU turnovers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ability to force the turnover was important for us,''
Gobrecht said. ``And the boards were the difference in the first
half.''
</P>
<P>
   USC (5-5) scored nine of the final 11 points before
intermission, four by freshman guard Tiffany Elmore, to put ASU
(6-4) in a hole that only increased its offensive impatience.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told them we needed to take a big, fat chill pill on
offense,'' Turner Thorne said. ``I guess that pill dissolved before
tip-off.''
</P>
<P>
   Kristine Sand, starting at power forward in place of Combs, had
16 of her 20 points in the first half, but the other ASU starters
were a combined 0 for 8 from the field.
</P>
<P>
   Center Rachel Holt, limited by three fouls to just nine
first-half minutes, scored seven of her nine points in the second
half, and forward Kisha White had eight in her season debut, but
the perimeter never caught fire.
</P>
<P>
   Point guard Natalie Tucker's nine assists were more than offset
by 10 turnovers. Her USC counterpart, Kristen Clark, had eight
assists and four turnovers. The Trojans recorded an 18-8 edge in
steals.
</P>
<P>
   USC 6-4 senior center Adrain Williams had another big game
against ASU with a game-high 22 points and eight rebounds.
Sophomore forward Tashara Carter had 10 points and 10 boards.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those are the kind of things she (Carter) needs to do for
us,'' Gobrecht said. ``She has an excellent basketball body. She
was the difference.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sun Devils' best chance to rally came with the score 42-31,
when USC commited its seventh team foul, with 13:59 remaining. But
Kitch Kitchen missed the first of a one-and-one, and a steal by
Carter triggered a three-point play by Williams and 10-2 run that
closed the door.
</P>
<P>
   Now ASU must rebound against ninth-ranked UCLA (9-4, 1-0), which
held off Arizona on Saturday. That game is at 7 p.m. Tuesday,
pushed back a day because of the Fiesta Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're both the kind of teams that are going to give this
conference some fits,'' Gobrecht said. ``I wouldn't be surprised if
ASU gets the Bruins.'' &QL;

PLAYER SAYS FIGHTS GO WITH HOCKEY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB MCMANAMAN  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Louie DeBrusk has been up, down and all around this season in
the Coyotes' organization. In the past month, in fact, the
6-foot-2, 235-pound enforcer has changed teams seven times and
changed leagues three times.
</P>
<P>
   From Las Vegas to Springfield. From Springfield to Las Vegas.
From Las Vegas to Phoenix. Back to Las Vegas. Back up to Phoenix.
And ditto twice more. Until Friday, that is, when he was sent back
to the minors after the 2-1 overtime loss to Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   Before his most recent short stint in the NHL, however, DeBrusk
had some interesting observations that bear repeating. The
conversation shifted to fighting, and DeBrusk, who has collected
153 penalty minutes in 24 games for Las Vegas, was asked how he
feels when fans say the NHL should abolish fisticuffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be totally honest with you, I'd like to meet these people
because I'd love to watch them when a fight happens on the ice and
see what they're doing,'' DeBrusk said. ``Do they really close
their eyes and put their hands up over their face? . . . I'll bet
you their mouths are wide open and they're watching the fight in
awe just like everybody else.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never ever to this day met someone that's come up to me
and told me that fighting should be taken out of the game. This is
my eighth year of pro hockey, and I've never had a fan say that. I
know they're out there, but whoever these people are who are saying
this, they just want to create controversy and say what they're
going to say.
</P>
<P>
   ``The game's changed, I'll grant them that. You can't just be an
enforcer anymore. You've got to be able to play the trap. You've
got to be able to skate. You've got to be able to play good
defensively. And you've got to be a good team guy. If you don't
have those four or five qualities, you're not going to play in the
NHL.''
</P>
<P>
   The game, though, will always allow for rough play, DeBrusk
said. Hard hits are a part of the game. So is intimidation and the
threat of intimidation. So, too, is the occasional fight. Without
it, the star, skilled players would be potential victims every
night.
</P>
<P>
   Wayne Gretzky has long been in support of banning fighting, but
don't forget, the Great One always had a thug skating on his wing
for protection, whether it was Marty McSorley or Dave Semenko.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll say 99.9 percent of the fans like to see a fight, whether
they believe it or not,'' said DeBrusk, who has dropped the gloves
14 times this season for Las Vegas. ``I'm not condoning it or
saying young kids should go out there and play aggressive hockey
and drop your gloves and fight the next kid that gives you a dirty
look.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just saying, `Look, it's a physical game and it's going to
happen.' When there's a bench-clearing brawl in baseball, nobody
seems to rant and rave about it. But a couple guys . . . slug it
out, I mean, it's one of the most exciting things in sports. It's
great entertainment. I don't care what anyone says.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are afraid to say it, but myself, I sit down and watch
hockey fights on video all the time. I just love them. I think
they're great. And I respect every guy who drops his gloves. My
hat's off to anybody that's willing to do that.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
Trades-R-Us &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The slumping Chicago Blackhawks continue to shake up things in
an effort to get out of their funk. General Manager Bob Murray made
two more trades last week, including a deal that sent veteran Paul
Coffey to Carolina for Nelson Emerson. That move, Murray said, was
a direct result of inconsistent play by youngsters Eric Daze, Chad
Kilger and Ethan Moreau.
</P>
<P>
   ``The situation has been well-documented,'' Murray said, ``so I
have to get players who can play with the (Alexei) Zhamnovs and
(Doug) Gilmours now. I hear we're putting too much pressure on the
kids and they don't have the confidence. That's horse (expletive).
It's having a passion for the game. You've been playing hockey
since you were 4 or 5 years old and either you want to win or you
don't. . . . It doesn't seem that losing bothers some of these
guys.' '
</P>
<P>
   Expect to see Kilger, Daze or Moreau dealt before the March
trading deadline. Ditto, perhaps, captain Chris Chelios, who's
become a Windy City landmark. About the only safe Blackhawk at the
moment is Tony Amonte. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Only human &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   After his team got shut out by the Buffalo Sabres last week,
Tampa Bay Lightning Coach Jacques Demers boldly pronounced,
``Dominik Hasek is God.''
</P>
<P>
   Three nights later, Hasek got shelled by New Jersey,
surrendering four early goals before getting pulled in a 7-4 rout
in which he gave up three scores on the Devils' first three shots.
</P>
<P>
   Friday night against Anaheim, the Dominator got waxed again,
7-2. This time, Coach Lindy Ruff didn't do Hasek any favors and
left in his star goalie for the entire game.
</P>
<P>
   What's wrong with the two-time defending Hart Trophy winner?
Maybe nothing. Sources, however, say his focus might be distracted
because of a serious back injury to his wife, who just underwent
surgery after a reported fall down the stairs. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Unforgettable play &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When was the last time you saw a player put a puck into his own
net from the other end of the rink during a delayed penalty? It
happened Tuesday to Edmonton's Janne Niinimaa during a game against
Montreal. His blind pass banked off the side boards and went 180
feet before finding the net.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Recchi, who had been called for tripping moments earlier,
was credited with the goal because he was the last Montreal player
to touch the puck.
</P>
<P>
   ``What a brutal feeling,'' said Oilers goalie Bob Essensa, the
backup that night.
</P>
<P>
   Edmonton GM Glen Sather was involved in a similar play several
years ago while playing for the Pittsburgh Penguins.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the one and only night I got a hat trick in the
NHL,'' Sather said.
</P>
<P>
   The goal, Sather said, was initially credited to a teammate. Two
days later, the NHL officially changed the scoring.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess it was a write-in hat trick,'' Sather joked. &QL;

WNHL ON HORIZON?  
 SOURCES: NHL LIKELY TO START WOMEN'S LEAGUE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB MCMANAMAN  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   One of the WNBA's more popular slogans is ``We got next.''
</P>
<P>
   Could women ice hockey players be next in line to shout a
similar catch phrase? According to high-level sources in the NHL,
there is a better than 75 percent chance that a women's
professional league will make its debut in North America within the
next few years.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed league, which has yet to go public with its
intentions and still is in the formative stages, apparently will
mirror the WNBA in principle. For it to succeed, it will need the
financial support and sponsorship of the NHL and, like the WNBA,
franchises likely will be owned and operated by NHL owners.
</P>
<P>
   The league may also take on a similar name as the WNBA _ the
WNHL.
</P>
<P>
   The NHL hasn't formally attached itself to the idea as yet. NHL
officials want to proceed cautiously, sources said, because of
financial burdens affecting franchises such as the Pittsburgh
Penguins, the New York Islanders and a few teams in Canada.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once we get those problems solved, I think it'll be a go,''
one NHL executive said. ``Look, there's no reason to rush this
thing. It wouldn't be fair to the women, and it certainly wouldn't
be fair to the NHL clubs who are going through some tough times
right now.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need stability first in a few places. Then we can go on the
fly with this.''
</P>
<P>
   Two NHL owners said privately they support the idea.
</P>
<P>
   Cammi Granato, the captain of the 1998 gold medal-winning U.S.
Olympic women's team, expressed guarded optimism when informed
about the proposed league.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's more news than I've ever heard,'' said Granato, in her
first season as a radio analyst for the Los Angeles Kings. ``I
mean, I've heard there have been talks about a pro league, but that
there were concerns about the financial backing. But if an NHL
owner is saying that, that's definitely something to get excited
about. That's what it's going to take to get something like that
off the ground.''
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix has been mentioned as one of the six to eight target
cities the league hopes to initially attract in its first year. An
NHL source said the Valley probably wouldn't get a franchise unless
the Coyotes move out of America West Arena and into a building of
their own.
</P>
<P>
   The women's team would help fill needed dates at the new arena.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, we as athletes would love it,'' said Granato, the
career leading scorer in U.S. women's national team history and
women's international hockey history. ``And I couldn't dream of
anything better.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it's not going to work at the pro level unless somebody
gets involved like the NHL or a big corporation. Right now, I
thought with so much expansion (in the NHL) and them trying to get
the attendance up in all of the new buildings, the NHL had a lot of
different things to worry about. So I didn't really foresee
anything like this happening. But maybe I just wasn't thinking
positively enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``You kind of not want to get your hopes up too much.
Realistically, I think it's still some time away. But don't get me
wrong, it would be great.''
</P>
<P>
   Granato said the league would have to be careful where it places
teams. For instance, she isn't so sure it would sell in Los
Angeles. Or even Boston, for that matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boston is a place where you'd think a million people will show
up for hockey because everyone's a hockey fan,'' she said. ``But I
don't think it would work in Boston because people are hometown
fans there. They love their Red Sox. They love their Celtics. They
love their Bruins. And that's it. That's not going to change. So
you have to be careful.''
</P>
<P>
   Are there enough talented female players to field an entire pro
league? Granato says absolutely. All they are waiting for is an
opportunity to shout ``We got next'' like their basketball sisters.
</P>
<P>
   ``My theory is you only need 15 players on a team, too,''
Granato said. ``You don't need 20.''
</P>
<P>
   If the WNHL becomes a reality, Granato may have a difficult
choice to make. Would she stay in broadcasting, a job she has been
getting rave reviews for, or would she ditch the headphones for a
helmet and hit the ice?
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, let me just say that first of all, I've been honored to
have this opportunity, and I feel fortunate to have this
opportunity,'' Granato said of her job with the Kings. ``The
organization could not be better to me. Everybody's been so first
class.
</P>
<P>
   ``But obviously as an athlete, my dream when I was a kid was to
be a professional hockey player, too. So if there was a chance to
play in a league, you'd better believe I'd be there.'' &QL;

SUN DEVILS COLLAPSE  
 TROJANS RALLY IN PAC-10 OPENER 
</HEADLINE>
  STATE-USC-AZR   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB COHN  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The returning Arizona State players who didn't
want to be reminded of the 46-point loss to Southern California in
the Pac-10 finale last year, who found it absolutely irrelevant to
the present, were right. This ``is'' a new team and a new season.
</P>
<P>
   The Sun Devils proved that Saturday by grabbing an 18-point lead
in the first half against the Trojans. But then they let it get
away and the result, achieved differently, turned out the same as
USC came back to win, 72-70, at the Sports Arena in the conference
opener and Pac-10 debut of first-year Coach Rob Evans.
</P>
<P>
   In a complete role-reversal from last year's game here, the Sun
Devils led, 38-20, with 3:43 left in the first half. But then ASU
went scoreless the rest of the half and the Trojans cut the lead to
nine.
</P>
<P>
   The Sun Devils went up by 14 after the break, then it was all
USC. Led by the inside-outside combination of Brian Scalabrine and
Elias Ayuso, the Trojans shot 63 percent in the second half and
snapped the Sun Devils' six-game winning streak.
</P>
<P>
   Scalabrine, a 6-foot-9 sophomore forward who transferred after
playing a year in junior college, made 10 of 12 shots and had 25
points, 16 after halftime. Ayuso, a 6-2 senior guard who had a
career-high 25 points in last year's blowout, made 4 of 7
three-point shots and scored 18 points, more than twice his
average.
</P>
<P>
   ASU (8-5) committed 11 of its 18 turnovers in the second half
after the Trojans (9-1) got out of an early box-and-one focused on
Eddie House, which didn't work. And when Scalabrine and Ayuso
weren't scoring in the half-court game, USC beat the Sun Devils
down the floor for easy baskets.
</P>
<P>
   ``We made a lot of mistakes,'' said forward Bobby Lazor, who had
19 points and eight rebounds for the Sun Devils before fouling out
with 11 seconds left. ``They kind of turned up their defense and
ran a run-and-jump sort of thing. They were switching a lot and I
think for stretches, we tried to force things and turned it over or
didn't get a good shot.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Evans, ``USC was switching defenses on us. We stood around
too much in the second half and didn't execute. We took some quick
shots. We also got too tentative out there, and it hurt us. . . .
We didn't attack the basket like we should have and make them pay
for trapping us.''
</P>
<P>
   House, who began the game averaging 21.2 points and leading the
conference in scoring, made just 2 of 10 shots and had 11 points.
He never got untracked even after USC got out of its box-and-one,
which the Sun Devils exploited to take their big lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``They played great defense, but I was missing shots I usually
hit,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   House, who scored his 1,000th career point, still was in
position to tie the score or even win it after Jarvis Turner missed
a pair of free throws with seven seconds left and USC up by two.
But Quincy Wilder poked the ball from House in the Trojans' end,
and Alton Mason traveled trying to save it, denying ASU a final
opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   House played in foul trouble for much of the second half. So did
senior forward Mike Batiste, who along with House and Lazor gave
the Sun Devils three players averaging more than 18 points a game.
Batiste had 14 points and just five rebounds, the third straight
game in which he has had five rebounds or fewer.
</P>
<P>
   Rebounding was a point of contention for Evans, even though ASU
had a 30-27 edge on the boards and outrebounded its ninth straight
opponent. USC had six of its seven offensive rebounds in the second
half.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the middle of the second half we didn't do a good job
boxing them out,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to play smarter, we've got to execute and we've got
to take care of details. You take care of details _ box out, handle
the basketball _ then you win these ballgames on the road.'' &QL;

UCLA DOWNS ARIZONA  
 BRUINS TAKE EARLY BIG LEAD, HOLD ON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PAUL CORO  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ For every action, there is always a very opposite
UCLA basketball reaction.
</P>
<P>
   Ever the unpredictable bunch, the Bruins kept up the reputation
in Saturday's Pac-10 opener against Arizona, despite enough
distractions to make Coach Steve Lavin's hair crack.
</P>
<P>
   A star freshman was suspended, another could not start because
of the flu, practices were lackluster, and the undefeated Wildcats
were in town. But for a team younger than junior college squads,
10th-ranked UCLA sure looked cool in turning sixth-ranked Arizona
cold and holding the Wildcats off for a 82-75 victory at sold-out
Pauley Pavillion.
</P>
<P>
   The youthful Bruins (9-2) came out fired up and turned delirious
when it jumped on Arizona (8-1) quickly.
</P>
<P>
   A couple of early three-pointers helped UCLA jump ahead, 8-2,
but it was the Baron Davis-Earl Watson backcourt chewing up Arizona
with penetration from there, whether the Wildcats played man or
zone. Seventeen of UCLA's next 19 points came underneath the
basket.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Wildcats were bumbling the ball like a team that
had not seen a quality opponent in a month. Arizona committed 11
first-half turnovers, but made matters worse by missing what easy
chances it did get in the paint.
</P>
<P>
   A 54 percent shooter entering Saturday, A.J. Bramlett had a
five-point first half that included four misses on the post, an air
ball jumper and two layups. His center counterpart, ``sick''
freshman Jerome Moiso, had 12 of his 21 points off the bench in the
first half.
</P>
<P>
   ``We weren't shooting the ball, and we weren't competing on
defense,'' Bramlett said. ``It was just lack of effort. You can't
get in a hole in the Pac-10, especially UCLA at L.A., and get down
and expect to get back. At first, guys were scared or nervous or
something.''
</P>
<P>
   The Wildcats missed 19 of 26 shots as a team to find themselves
in a 40-24 rut by halftime.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was disappointed, embarrassed for some of our players and
the program that we would come out and not get after it,'' Arizona
Coach Lute Olson said.
</P>
<P>
   The ball-hawking defense continued in the second half, but the
Bruins picked up more team fouls, nine, in six minutes than it had
all of the first half. That still could not do Arizona any good as
it missed 4 of its first 5, continued to handle the ball sloppily
and escorted UCLA's offense into the paint.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins scored on eight of their first 10 second-half
possessions and stretched the lead to as much as 59-37 with 12:47
to go.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just had a lack of intensity and competitiveness,'' said
Arizona senior guard Jason Terry, who scored a team high 19. ``We
played with no heart, and they played with a lot of enthusiasm and
energy like they wanted the game, and they did.''
</P>
<P>
   UCLA was actually a poor perimeter team after a hot start, but
it was moot because of Arizona's pillow-soft interior defense. The
Wildcats got as close as five with 19.8 seconds to play, but UCLA
held off the Cats by playing a whole half with all of its points
coming in the paint or at the free-throw line.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins shot 50 percent for the game, while Arizona shot just
37 percent, despite scoring 30 points in the final nine minutes to
rally. The Wildcats finished with 27 offensive rebounds that they
turned into 27 points.

REACHING THEIR GOALS  
 FIESTA KICKERS LINE UP AS WINNERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PAOLA BOIVIN  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Football found Jeff Hall in his Winchester, Tenn., backyard. Two
trees were his goal posts, a wood block his tee.
</P>
<P>
   It came to Sebastian Janikowski in Daytona Beach, Fla., where
the teen soccer standout from Poland had moved to be with his
father.
</P>
<P>
   The difference between the place-kickers for Monday's Fiesta
Bowl can be measured by worlds, not hashmarks. The common thread is
that they are two of the best in the country and could play a key
role in the national championship game. Most believe it will be won
by a three- or four-point margin.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it comes down to a kick, there's nobody I'd rather have out
there,'' Volunteers Coach Phillip Fulmer said about senior Hall.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we had him in the early '90s, we might have won a couple
more championships,'' Florida State Coach Bobby Bowden said about
sophomore Janikowski.
</P>
<P>
   The pair couldn't be more opposite.
</P>
<P>
   Janikowski grew up playing soccer.
</P>
<P>
   Hall, in his choir-boy way, will tell you he doesn't have much
use for the sport.
</P>
<P>
   Janikowski stands 6 feet 2, 255 pounds and is an imposing
presence with his shaved head.
</P>
<P>
   Hall tips the scales at 6-feet, 180 and, frankly, has probably
never imposed on anyone or anything in his life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel sorry for the little kickers that weigh 165-170,''
Janikowski said. ``I know how (other players) treat them, and I
know how they treated me as a freshman.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Dude can kick a football farther than anyone I've seen in my
life,'' Hall said.
</P>
<P>
   Janikowski's forte is definitely his leg strength. It's not
uncommon for him to kick a 70-yarder. He was given the Lou Groza
Award for the nation's best kicker this season after making 27
field goals (in 32 attempts) and setting an Atlantic Coast
Conference record.
</P>
<P>
   Hall's strength is consistency. He has earned all-Southeastern
Conference honors four straight years and has hit 11 of his past 12
field goals and 19 of 24 overall this season. He nailed all 47
extra points.
</P>
<P>
   He made game-winning kicks against Syracuse, as time ran out,
and Florida, in overtime.
</P>
<P>
   This may be the biggest difference between the two. Janikowski
has not been required to kick a game-winner this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's won two games for them,'' Janikowski said of Hall. ``I've
got a lot of respect for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Halls considers his most memorable kick the game-winning
34-yarder against Georgia in the second game of his freshman
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gave me a foundation to build my career on,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Did it ever. He made 64 percent of his attempts as a freshman
and bettered that mark this season with a 79.2 percent effort. He's
had a few rough spots in between, including a back injury, but
overall, he's been one of Tennessee's most reliable players during
the past four seasons.
</P>
<P>
   When asked about Hall's success, Fulmer laughs and credits his
Winchester roots, a hometown the two share.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jeff is a really hard worker and a dedicated person and has
excellent ability,'' Fulmer said. ``When you put those things
together, it lends itself to being a really good player.''
</P>
<P>
   Hall taught himself to kick as a youth after buying a tee and
reading the accompanying manual, a how-to book by former NFL
standout Jan Stenerud.
</P>
<P>
   In high school he kicked a state record 62-yard field goal as a
sophomore. He did the same thing the next year.
</P>
<P>
   After redshirting his first season at Tennessee, his career took
off.
</P>
<P>
   Hall is known around Knoxville as much for his spiritual talks
as he is for his football. He is an in-demand speaker and often
talks to groups in his spare time.
</P>
<P>
   He also is considered the ultimate nice guy. He recently pulled
over for a homeless man on a Knoxville street, popped the man's
wheelchair in his backseat and took him and several of his homeless
friends to dinner.
</P>
<P>
   Janikowski is considered a nice guy, too, although his teammates
didn't know what to think when he showed up in 1997 with a shaved
head and a way of speaking ``that was kind of funny,'' guard Jason
Whitaker said.
</P>
<P>
   Janikowski, whose father is a former soccer player, had hoped to
play professional soccer, scoring 73 goals as a senior at Seabreeze
High School. But his leg also made an impression with the football
team, and a year later he was off to Florida State on scholarship.
He set a school record with a 56-yarder against Wake Forest as a
freshman.
</P>
<P>
   He would like to try a longer one and has had discussions with
Bowden about potential kicks in the title game.
</P>
<P>
   ``We talked earlier this week, and he said that he might give me
a chance from 64 yards on in,'' Janikowski said. ``It depends on
the situation, such as score and time left.'' &QL;

FIESTA BOWL WILL BE LAST CALL FOR JACKSON 
</HEADLINE>
 JACKSON-AZR   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM GINTONIO  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's 60 minutes before kickoff. Coaches are ranting and pacing.
Players are wondering and hoping.
</P>
<P>
   Keith Jackson, meanwhile, is off in his world, relaxing,
thinking, trying to hide.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what I'm going to miss the most,'' said Jackson, the
veteran ABC college football announcer whose last game will be
Monday's Fiesta Bowl at Sun Devil Stadium. ``It's that hour before
the game that's the special time. At least it is if the producer
leaves you alone to let you enjoy it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It goes beyond the pharaohs, when the leader led his troops
into the battle. That's the glorious part, when they first enter
the arena, that minute or two, when there's just something that's
been with mankind since there was a mankind.''
</P>
<P>
   Philosopher, fisherman, golfer.
</P>
<P>
   But it's in college football where Jackson, 70, made his mark
over three decades, speaking his mind, stepping on toes _ and
picking up millions of fans in the process, many of whom can do a
pretty decent Keith Jackson impression.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like cliches or that homespun stuff,'' ESPN analyst
Beano Cook said, ``but Keith always did it in a way people liked.
He brought a smile to your face. When he first started, I said,
`Boy, those cliches.' But after a while, I said, `This guy is the
best.' He's tremendous, he really is.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, I think when people go to football games on Saturday
afternoon that they won't feel like they're missing something by
not staying home and watching Keith.''
</P>
<P>
   Lee Corso, a former coach at Indiana and now an ESPN analyst,
sometimes wonders whether Jackson might be ``too'' nice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never heard the guy say anything mean,'' Corso said. ``I
remembering thinking at times, `Something has to be wrong.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Commentators and fans alike love doing Keith Jackson
impressions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whoa, Nellie!'' which he often says he never said during a
game, is the favorite. His trademark ``Fumblllllle!'' is another
oft-repeated line, as is ``rumblin', stumblin', bumblin'.''
</P>
<P>
   Monday's game will be a dual milestone: Jackson's finale and the
first one to decide what is being called the true national
championship.
</P>
<P>
   It may be a great game, but it will be only one of many that
Jackson has witnessed. He has reported the exploits of Heisman
Trophy winners and run-of-the-mill players; he recalls open-field
runs and missed tackles; he has seen the joy in a player's eyes as
well as the despair.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was always looking for Walter Mitty, and sometimes he would
show up,'' Jackson said.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson started doing games for ABC in 1962 and has been doing
the game of the week since 1966, when the network acquired the
rights. He first teamed with Jackie Jensen, the former Southern
California All-American running back and Boston Red Sox star. Lee
Groscup, Bud Wilkinson, Ara Parseghian and Frank Broyles preceded
Bob Griese, who joined Jackson 12 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   And even though Jackson prefers to look ahead, he can't help but
marvel at the outpouring of affection and attention he has received
on his farewell tour this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I had my druthers, I would have kept my mouth shut, and
when my time was up, I would have just walked away and said
goodbye,'' he said. ``It has been somewhat of a strain, but the
people have been so generous and kind. And I'm not used to crying
that much.''

<P>
   Jackson said two of of his prized gifts have been autographed
helmets from Arizona State and Michigan. He has received rocking
chairs, cooking school enrollments, blankets, a gold watch, a cow
bell, and whistles and flags from officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I'll never forget that day when 110,000 people clapped
their hands at Michigan,'' he said. ``Every time I think of it, I
get chills. I never realized . . . I don't think about that stuff.
I just go out and do the ballgame and go home.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people came up to me to stick out their hand. It's
something I never expected. It makes you realize that people out
there do like your work.''
</P>
<P>
   Griese said, ``It's been a joy to follow him around this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson wants to maintain a low profile for his finale, and he
says when he signs off for the last time, it won't be sentimental.
</P>
<P>
   ``I won't be emotional at all,'' he said. ``It's not my show.
The game belongs to Tennessee and Florida State and the people who
put it together. I'm gonna bust my chops to make sure it doesn't
happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll give the final score. That's all that matters. The game
will be treated with the kind of respect and dignity it deserves.''
</P>
<P>
   But he has his opinions on the state of affairs of college
football.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I could create anything I wanted to in college sports, and
if I had the power, I would . . . turn over control of the game and
the administration of the game to institutional control. I would
let the institutions conduct the activities. College presidents
want the money, but they don't want to make the decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   A decade ago, Jackson suggested a playoff, but his arguments
were rejected. Now, as a championship game approaches, he said the
Bowl Championship Series is a start in the right direction, but he
would do things differently.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still believe you need four teams,'' he said. ``But I think
if a community wants to have a bowl game and pay for it, let 'em.
I'm surprised the Rose Bowl went along with this. They could have
sat back and said, `We'll give each of you $15 million.' They could
have upped the ante, but ABC put pressure on them, and they went
along with it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anyway, after all the games, take the top four teams, ranked
by whatever system _ and take four so you don't make mistakes _ and
the winners would play.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could make a good case right now that you don't have the
best (No.) 1 and 2 teams, but in this system, you agreed to take
their two teams . . . and the end of the four years, tweak it. I
think you have to accept the fact that you are never going to
expunge provincialism in the pool. We have two very good football
teams here, but if they're the best, I don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   He said it would be hard to argue if Tennessee wins, but a
Florida State victory would give Ohio State a good argument.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson's outspokenness is what fans have found endearing. He
says he never has been reprimanded for his straight talk, probably,
he said, ``because I've always busted my (butt) to try to be
fair.''
</P>
<P>
   A bad call is a bad call, and there have been a lot of them in
the past few seasons, he said. But come Monday night, he may not
care as much.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a good time to leave,'' he said. ``There's a change of
ownership at ABC and a change of philosophy. My wife (Turi Ann) and
I decided that when we reached 70, we would sit back and take a
look at things.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, we're a blank page. We'll get up in the morning and
then decide what we're going to do with the rest of the day.''
</P>
<P>
   He and his wife plan to take golfing and fishing vacations in
the fall, and he said he may get to one or two games, but his
emphasis will be on enjoying his new lifestyle.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll leave in late August, and I'll play golf until I scream
and my fingers fall off, and then we'll go fishing. We're booked
for a golf journey (in the football season). The tourists will be
gone, the courses are glorious and the countryside can't be beat.
I've never had a September, October and November to do this.'' &QL;

MURRELL LOSES STEAM ON LONG RUN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE SCHOENFELD  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Cardinals running back  &UR; Adrian Murrell didn't mind the ribbing.
His teammates can tease him any time he goes 74 yards off-tackle.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been making fun of him for his wheels,'' offensive guard
 &UR; Chris
 &UR; Dishman said.  &UR; ``Deion (Sanders) caught him from behind. How could
he let that happen?''
</P>
<P>
   Murrell was caught from behind by Sanders, one of the NFL's
fastest players, after running to the Cowboys' 3 early in the third
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   It was the longest run of Murrell's career when he's not playing
against the Cardinals. He had a 78-yard run for the New York Jets
at Sun Devil Stadium two years ago to help the Jets get their only
victory of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We weren't happy with how we had been running the ball,'' said
offensive tackle  &UR; Lomas Brown of the Cardinals' 11 yards rushing in
the first half. ``It set the tempo and tone for the rest of the
game.''
</P>
<P>
   Murrell, who finished with a game-high 95 yards, didn't think
his season-best run was a bigger play than the 59-yard reception by
wide receiver Frank Sanders in the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Two plays later, Murrell scored on a 12-yard shovel pass for a
7-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was big that we got the score early,'' Murrell said. ``The
last time we played them, they jumped to a 28-point lead. We
couldn't dig a hole early.'' &QL; 
__ &QC;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Frank Sanders said he was startled that he was able to make a
one-handed grab.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't think I'd get it,'' he said. ``I just stuck my hand
out and boom.'' &QL; 
__ &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Middle linebacker &UR; Ronald McKinnon called linebacker &UR; Mark
Maddox's second-quarter stop of running back  &UR; Emmitt Smith on
fourth and 1 at the Cardinals 7 the game's turning point.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals blitzed, using a defense called goal-line five
clap.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were down on our stoop,'' McKinnon said. ``Mark and I
just shot the gap.
</P>
<P>
   ``We went into the game knowing the first thing we had to do was
stop the run. Everyone made a concerted effort. The coaches did a
great job of mixing things up.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals used five-men, three-men and four-men defensive
fronts and also inserted safety Pat Tillman in the game as a
linebacker in their cub formation.
</P>
<P>
   __ &QC;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Leigh Steinberg, agent for Cardinals quarterback &UR; Jake Plummer
and Dallas'  &UR; Troy Aikman, thinks the victory could have long-range
effects in the NFC East.
</P>
<P>
   ``That quaking sound you hear is a changing of the guard,''
Steinberg said. &QL; 
__ &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Cardinals center  &UR; Aaron Graham, who grew up in nearby Denton,
Texas, used to dream of winning a playoff game in Texas Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   He thought it would be in a Cowboys uniform, however.
</P>
<P>
   ``After not being drafted by the Cowboys, I'm just thankful that
I was wearing red today instead of blue,'' Graham said. &QL;

`ANYTHING'S POSSIBLE' NEXT WEEK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DON KETCHUM  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ When the Cardinals move inside the Metrodome
next Sunday for their second-round playoff game against the NFC
Central Division champion Minnesota Vikings, do they have more than
an outside chance to win?
</P>
<P>
   ``You're asking the wrong guy,'' was the terse response from
Dallas Cowboys quarterback Troy Aikman, whose team fell to Arizona,
20-7, on Saturday and served as the main course in the Vikings'
Thanksgiving feast, 46-36, at Texas Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys receiver Patrick Jeffers was a little more diplomatic.
</P>
<P>
   ``This time of year, anything's possible,'' said Jeffers, who
caught seven passes for 92 yards against Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Jeffers should know. Last season, he was a member of a wild-card
Denver Broncos team that plowed through the AFC playoffs on its way
to defeating the Green Bay Packers in Super Bowl XXXII.
</P>
<P>
   ``Minnesota is a tough place to go play, but a few big plays,
and things can turn around,'' Jeffers said.
</P>
<P>
   Said Dallas owner-General Manager Jerry Jones: ``It's a cliche,
but it's not a cliche. Any team is capable of beating another,
especially one with a good quarterback. And Arizona is a team with
a good quarterback.''
</P>
<P>
   That would be Jake Plummer, the second-year phenom from Arizona
State.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a good quarterback. I'm a Jake Plummer fan. No doubt
about it. I'm a fan,'' Cowboys cornerback Deion Sanders said.
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota's defense will have its hands full with Plummer. But
Arizona's defense will face an even tougher test with a Vikings
offense that set an NFL scoring record with Randall Cunningham at
quarterback, Cris Carter and rookie Randy Moss as the primary wide
receivers and Robert Smith in the backfield.
</P>
<P>
   Before Moss was at Marshall, he was enrolled for about a year at
Florida State, where Cardinals rookie defensive end Andre Wadsworth
was one of his teammates.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the best,'' Wadsworth said.
</P>
<P>
   Because of Moss' extraordinary ability, the receiver earned the
nickname ``The Freak.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He works hard in the weight room and on the field. He's tall,
fast and athletic,'' Wadsworth said.
</P>
<P>
   Another rookie, Cardinals right cornerback Corey Chavous,
expects to play a key role, as he did Saturday against the Cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   Veteran left corner Aeneas Williams was occupied with the
Cowboys' Michael Irvin, and Chavous knew he would get a lot of
passes thrown at him by Aikman.
</P>
<P>
   Williams figures to be on Carter or Moss, leaving Chavous . . .
</P>
<P>
   ``You think today was bad, wait until next week,'' said Chavous,
who had five passes defensed and three tackles on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   However, Cowboys Coach Chan Gailey said the Arizona secondary
``made our guys not catch the ball cleanly, and they're capable of
doing the same things to other people.'' &QL;

YOUNG LINE MEN PROVE THEY'RE GROWN UPS

<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ Cardinals Coach Vince Tobin showed there is fire
beneath his tranquil demeanor by turning a compliment about the
offensive line against its presenter after Saturday's 20-7 playoff
win over Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, aren't those the guys who were the cause of all our
problems, (the guys who) everyone said couldn't play earlier this
year?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   Well, yes.
</P>
<P>
   But Tobin had no reason to find fault with the Cardinals'
offensive line Saturday. To wit:
</P>
<P>
   After being sacked five times in two regular-season games
against the Cowboys, Jake Plummer was not sacked once in 36 pass
attempts Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   A line with three second-year starters _ Chris Dishman, James
Dexter and Aaron Graham _ did not commit an illegal-motion or a
holding penalty.
</P>
<P>
   After being embarrassed by Dallas in two regular-season games in
which the Cowboys rushed for 334 yards to Arizona's 77, the
Cardinals reversed the tables and outrushed the Cowboys, 133 yards
to 96.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't pretty, and we did some good and bad things, but the
totality of it was that we won,'' guard Lester Holmes said. ``These
young guys I'm playing with have a lot of heart.''
</P>
<P>
   Veteran left tackle Lomas Brown wasn't surprised that his
younger cohorts displayed poise beyond their years in their first
playoff experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not at all,'' he said. ``We didn't give up a sack or have many
penalties against New Orleans, and San Diego was basically the same
way,'' he said, referring to the Cardinals' final two
regular-season games. ``We're peaking right now. And man, are we
ever doing it at the right time.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown thinks the Cardinals are the Cinderella of the playoff
ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could be. A lot of people didn't think we could do it,'' he
said. ``We got in the playoffs when nobody thought we would. We're
the team that is always coming from behind. We're the exciting team
that can never hold a lead. We have all these negative aspects, but
the one thing they can't measure is your heart.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do have heart and will battle everyone until the bitter
end.''
</P>
<P>
   Guard Dishman, who had the herculean task of going against big
Leon Lett, said he thinks the Cardinals caught the Cowboys by
surprise.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a great game plan and really had nothing to lose,''
Dishman said. ``Everyone was saying we'd made it here for the first
time in 30 years or something like that, and I think they took us
lightly.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you get down early and have to play catch-up, things get
a little tighter. But we got the lead early and were having fun.
It's easier to play an error-free game when you have the lead.''
</P>
<P>
   Dishman was especially pleased the Cardinals didn't allow a
sack.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know they got one hurry, though,'' he said. ``Big Leon got
me once high on my arm and got past, but other than that, I played
decently.''
</P>
<P>
   Dishman's former teammate at Nebraska, center Graham, threw the
big block that sprang running back Adrian Murrell for a 74-yard run
on the first possession of the third quarter. That set up a 3-yard
Plummer-to-Larry Centers touchdown pass that gave Arizona a 17-0
lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're still not satisfied,'' Graham said. ``There are a lot of
things we'd like to take back, but we got 20 points, and the
defense was phenomenal. It was an outside play where Adrian picks
his hole. He cut it back behind me, and I was sealing my man and
got him down. He never even saw him.'' &QL;

CHAVOUS SHINES AT CORNER  
 ROOKIE GETS RIGHT TO POINT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By TIM TYERS  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ The ``Preacher'' proved he was a prophet, and
because of it, the ``General'' was able to successfully complete
his war games Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The Preacher is none other than rookie cornerback Corey Chavous,
who finally has supplied the Cardinals' defense with a much-needed
piece _ a right cornerback.
</P>
<P>
   The General? Aeneas Williams, who not only declared war on the
state of Texas but also on Cowboys wide receiver Michael Irvin and
quarterback Troy Aikman, doubling his seasonlong interception total
with two picks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I gotta give it to him _ Corey made them throw my way,'' said
Williams, who held Irvin to four catches for 32 yards. ``Corey
loves to talk. Whenever you're around him, you're going to hear
him. I think he's going to be called to be a preacher.
</P>
<P>
   ``When rookies tell you something, sometimes you just laugh at
them. But Corey told me, `If I get at that cornerback position, I'm
going to make 'em throw your way.' He made that comment before he
ever got out there to cornerback. He might be a prophet as well as
a preacher.''
</P>
<P>
   He certainly was Saturday. Chavous, who spent much of the season
at safety before a string of injuries to the cornerbacks led
coaches to plug him into the position in a loss to Kansas City, was
as annoying to Dallas receivers as flypaper to flies.
</P>
<P>
   He made three solo tackles and deflected five passes. He even
had a first-half interception negated by a holding call against
him. Even Dallas fans called it a break for the home team.
</P>
<P>
   ``He stepped up big for us,'' said safety Tommy Bennett, who
contributed an interception late in the game. ``For a rookie who's
in the playoffs for the first time, you might expect for him to
have wide eyes, or maybe choking under the pressure.
</P>
<P>
   ``But he took it all in stride. He's played that way all year.
They haven't really attacked him this year. He came in against
Kansas City and got a pick and covered (Andre) Rison wherever he
went and they've respected him ever since. He proved again today
that he's a legitimate NFL corner.''
</P>
<P>
   Chavous, a dedicated student of the game, said his performance
was the product of preparation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I picked up some things on their splits and the things they
like to do,'' he said. ``I was able to anticipate some of the
routes they were running. I really felt good out there today. My
transition was good, and I was able to make plays on the ball
because of it.''
</P>
<P>
   The deeply religious Williams wasted no time declaring war on
Minnesota, the second-round opponent next Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want anybody looking at me like I've done something
great,'' he said. ``When we left, I told fans at the airport that
there was Desert Storm, then Desert Fox. Now there's Desert We
Gotta Do it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to enjoy this for now and when we get together
again, we'll get our artillery together, clean our weapons and get
ready to go to war again.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams said he wasn't worried Dallas would try to get Irvin
off to a fast start.
</P>
<P>
   ``It didn't matter once we declared war,'' he said. ``It's like
when the U.S. declared war on Iraq. It didn't matter where their
missiles were, we were going to find them. Our motto the last four
weeks has been `We gotta do it.' '' &QL;

AIKMAN TAKES IT LYING DOWN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DON KETCHUM  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ It has been a long time since followers of the
Dallas Cowboys have had an empty feeling such as this.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our organization is set up to win a Super Bowl, and when you
don't do that . . . yes, it's very disappointing,'' said Jerry
Jones, the team's owner and general manager, after the humbling
wild-card playoff loss at the hands of the Cardinals on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of moving on to the next round, maintaining their hopes
of earning a record sixth Lombardi Trophy that signifies the NFL
championship, the Cowboys were left battered and bruised.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the man feeling it the most was quarterback Troy Aikman.
Due to Cardinals sacks and pressure, he spent a large part of the
crisp winter afternoon flat on his back looking through the hole of
the Texas Stadium roof.
</P>
<P>
   Aikman threw a whopping 49 passes, completing just 22 for 191
yards and a touchdown to finally put Dallas on the board with 3:33
left in the game. The longest completion went for 19 yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``We struggled in a lot of different areas,'' Aikman said. ``You
can place the blame, put criticism on all the (offensive)
positions. We just failed to convert, keep drives going.''
</P>
<P>
   Some failures came as the result of dropped passes. Some came
when Aikman threw the ball poorly. And some came from penalties.
</P>
<P>
   On the outside, Aikman, the Most Valuable Player of Super Bowl
XXVII in 1993, showed no emotion. But inside, Coach Chan Gailey
knew better.
</P>
<P>
   ``Troy sometimes has the need to carry the team,'' Gailey said.
``It's hard on him. It's hard to do. Everyone does their job and
then no one has to shoulder that kind of burden.''
</P>
<P>
   Aikman was asked whether he had varying degrees of
disappointment.
</P>
<P>
   ``When something like this happens _ it's a matter of the longer
you play _ you don't know how many opportunities you're going to
get,'' he said. ``I feel confident that Jerry (Jones) and Chan
(Gailey) are going to get together and help us do some things so
that we can better ourselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's guys like myself, Emmitt (Smith, running back),
Michael (Irvin, receiver), Darren (Woodson, safety), just to name a
few, who have been through the better years. But we're not the same
team. We're relying on different people. We're looking through a
different window.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dallas defense played better than the offense but not good
enough.
</P>
<P>
   Star cornerback Deion Sanders, who was back in the lineup after
missing five games with a sore toe, was matter-of-fact.
</P>
<P>
   ``After this, how can you look in the mirror and be happy with
yourself?'' Sanders said. &QL;

UPSTART DEFENSE UNSADDLES COWBOYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By LEE SHAPPELL  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ It seemed a pretentious idea. The upstart
Cardinals' defense actually believed it could rattle the Dallas
Cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   C'mon. With Troy and Emmitt and Michael, who have three Super
Bowl rings each?
</P>
<P>
   And didn't the Cowboys ring up two of the three highest scores
against the Cardinals _ 38 in the opener and 35 more in November?
</P>
<P>
   And isn't this the defensive front seven that watched its last
two foes score fourth-quarter touchdowns that made photo finishes
necessary to get the team here Saturday for its playoff opener?
</P>
<P>
   Yes to all of the above. And so what?
</P>
<P>
   ``We really believed if we could get to them early, we could
frustrate them and take their heads out of the game,'' outside
linebacker Jamir Miller said after the Cardinals came within 3:33
minutes of shutting out the Cowboys at Texas Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals made key sacks and critical fourth-down stops,
knocked passes down and picked them off in a 20-7 win that moves
them into the second round Sunday at Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   Middle linebacker Ron McKinnon said, ``We messed them up by
mixing it up. We attacked them relentlessly.''
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys quarterback Troy Aikman suffered three interceptions and
was sacked four times _ twice by Miller, who correctly anticipated
the snap count and broke through before Aikman finished his drop.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Irvin, whose consecutive-game receiving streak was
snapped at 117 the last time he faced cornerback Aeneas Williams
and the Cardinals' defense, caught four passes for 32 yards and
generally was not a factor.
</P>
<P>
   And Emmitt Smith, who rushed for 122 and 117 yards against the
Cardinals in the regular season, gained 74, only 23 in the closing
half when the Cardinals successfully protected their lead.
</P>
<P>
   One of the league's most big-game-tested offenses that rolled
undefeated through NFC East competition got 260 total yards.
</P>
<P>
   Up front, the Cardinals used a five-man line to thwart Smith's
rushing, adding down lineman Carl Simpson and taking out a
linebacker. They blitzed Aikman into submission.
</P>
<P>
   According to safety Tommy Bennett, whose interception with 48
seconds left slammed the door, ``The biggest adjustment we made in
this game was bringing a greater sense of urgency.
</P>
<P>
   ``People had been running on us. Maybe all we needed was to be
one step faster in some situations.''
</P>
<P>
   They were plenty fast on two critical stops:
</P>
<P>
   Midway through the second quarter, the Cowboys, trailing, 7-0,
marched to the 7. Facing fourth and 1, Cowboys Coach Chan Gailey
eschewed the chip-shot field goal. Linebacker Mark Maddox broke
through and stopped Smith for a 1-yard loss. Usually, Maddox flows
with the motion man. Instead, he shot the gap.
</P>
<P>
   ``They just didn't expect that,'' Maddox said.
</P>
<P>
   Miller sacked Aikman for a 10-yard loss early in the fourth
quarter when the Cowboys went for it on fourth and 1 from their 33.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't give away my secrets, but I noticed their motion man
stopped in the same place every time, and that's when they snap the
ball,'' Miller said. ``When I saw the man (receiver Patrick
Jeffers) stop, that's when I started my rush.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's great to get a playoff win, but it means even more to
come in to Dallas and get it. This is such a big win. I don't know
what it signals, but it lets the world know the Cardinals are not a
joke.'' &QL;

THIS IS HOW YOU FIND A NEW COACH? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE SCHOENFELD  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   President Mike McCaskey is so worried about turning the Chicago
Bears into a winner, he went skiing last Monday after firing Coach
Dave Wannstedt.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Williams, a San Francisco management consultant who is the
creator of an executive search firm to promote African-American
coaching candidates, found out about McCaskey's vacation plans when
he called the Bears on Tuesday. He learned that Bears' offices were
``closed for the holidays.''
</P>
<P>
   So while the Carolina Panthers are close to hiring former San
Francisco Coach George Seifert, and the Philadelphia Eagles,
Baltimore Ravens, Seattle Seahawks, San Diego Chargers and
Cleveland Browns are setting up interviews, the man running the
Bears is in the mountains.
</P>
<P>
   Some names have surfaced on the Bears' list, including Cardinals
defensive coordinator Dave McGinnis. In addition, Dom Capers, fired
by Carolina a week ago, has expressed interest in the job, and
Minnesota Coach Dennis Green has recommended Green Bay offensive
coordinator Sherman Lewis, who every year seems to get passed over
for head coaching positions.
</P>
<P>
   But the Bears are behind the other teams looking for coaches
because Mark Hatley, the team's vice president for personnel, who
is charge of the search, didn't know that McCaskey was going to
fire Wannstedt until the morning it happened.
</P>
<P>
   Hatley doesn't exactly have a lot of confidence that he'll find
the next Vince Lombardi for the Bears. He told McCaskey there was
no guarantee he could find anyone better than Wannstedt.
</P>
<P>
   The Bears are so desperate that some in the organization are
hoping they'll consider Hall of Fame linebacker Mike Singletary,
who has coached as many games in his career as Chicago native
Hillary Clinton has.
</P>
<P>
   Former Bears teammate Tom Thayer has said Singletary would make
a great head coach, even though he has no experience.
</P>
<P>
   Since retiring in 1992, Singletary, 40, has been a motivational
speaker and a corporate consultant. He also has turned down several
NFL assistant coaching jobs, including under Buddy Ryan with the
Cardinals in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Singletary said he was flattered that his name had surfaced.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe when the situation is right, anything is possible,''
Singletary said. ``I would only coach the Bears.''
</P>
<P>
   The last person to go from player to NFL head coach was Norm Van
Brocklin, who played for the Eagles in 1960 and became head coach
of the expansion Vikings the next season.
</P>
<P>
   Hiring Singletary would be popular in Chicago but wouldn't
improve the Bears' personnel problems. They haven't had a player
voted into the Pro Bowl in five years.
</P>
<P>
   Blame it on the skier.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would like to take my responsibility and my share of the
blame,'' McCaskey said before heading to the slopes. &QL;  &QL; 
Country bumpkin
</P>
<P>
   Wayne Larrive, who has been the Bears' radio play-by-play man
since 1985, is moving to the Green Bay Packers next season to
replace retiring Jim Irwin.
</P>
<P>
   One Bears fan can't understand how Larrive could make that move.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you going to do your broadcast in orange hunting gear with
a shotgun on your side?'' the fan asked Larrive on Chicago radio
station WMAQ. ``And you have to buy a pickup truck now, right?''
</P>
<P>
   Larrive told the caller, ``This is not the University of Texas
I'm going to.'' &QL;  &QL; 
Far from perfect
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco quarterback Steve Young is 0-8 in his career
against the Green Bay Packers, today's opponent in an NFC wildcard
game.
</P>
<P>
   But he doesn't think that's accurate, because his first three
loses were with Tampa Bay, and with the 49ers he didn't play in one
game and lasted only one period in another. So he considers himself
just 0-3 against the Packers while with the 49ers.
</P>
<P>
   Green Bay has beaten the 49ers five straight times.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've been a roadblock for us,'' Young said. ``It's been
them to the Super Bowl or us, and we haven't gotten over that. When
somebody has beat you a number of times in a row, it becomes a
thing you want even more so to overcome.''
</P>
<P>
   The 49ers' troubles against Green Bay have come in the first
quarter, during which they've been outscored 53-6 in the past five
games. San Francisco also has had trouble protecting Young; he's
been sacked 16 times in the three games he has played.
</P>
<P>
   Young has no touchdown passes and three interceptions in playoff
losses to the Packers the past three years.
</P>
<P>
   Packers quarterback Brett Favre, meanwhile, has four TD passes
and no interceptions in those games.
</P>
<P>
   Another Green Bay win could mean the 49ers will fire Coach Steve
Mariucci and try to replace him with the Packers' Mike Holmgren.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a saying in the streets, `You ain't got no number,' ''
Packers safety LeRoy Butler said. ``That's what the 49ers are going
to tell Mike's agent if they lose. It could be $8 million.
Whatever. Fix this (stuff). How much is that worth to any team for
a guy to come in and fix it? And whoever gets him will be as lucky
as hell.'' &QL;  &QL; 
Latest scapegoat
</P>
<P>
   Unlike five other teams, the St. Louis Rams didn't fire their
head coach last week. That's because it would have cost more than
$10 million to dump Dick Vermeil and his staff.
</P>
<P>
   But the Rams still made a coaching move, firing offensive
coordinator Jerry Rhome, who had formerly held the same position
with the Cardinals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want this read as I am blaming Jerry Rhome for our
lack of success offensively,'' said Vermeil, whose offense was
ranked 27th in the league. ``It just didn't work out.''
</P>
<P>
   Here's why it didn't work out, according to one Rams offensive
starter. He said a frequent play-calling sequence in games featured
Rhome calling the play from the press box, followed by Vermeil
offering suggestions, offensive line coach Jim Hanifan giving
advice, tight ends coach Lynn Stiles putting in his two cents and
quarterbacks coach Mike White also having a say.
</P>
<P>
   While everyone was giving advice, the play clock was running.
Quarterback Tony Banks would signal in for the call, but by the
time it reached him, it bore little resemblance to the original
call.
</P>
<P>
   ``You wouldn't believe how often this happened,'' one player
said.
</P>
<P>
   Expect Rhome to end up in Atlanta, where he would be reunited
with quarterback Chris Chandler, who played for him on the
Cardinals. &QL;  &QL; 
Short shots
</P>
<P>
   Baltimore owner Art Modell plans to hire a current assistant
coach to replace ousted Ted Marchibroda. Among the possibilities
are Minnesota's Brian Billick, Jacksonville's Chris Palmer,
Pittsburgh's Jim Haslett and Philadelphia's Emmitt Thomas.
</P>
<P>
   ``The greatest coaches in the NFL historically are assistant
coaches who were elevated to the head coaching position,'' Modell
said. ``I'll give you Hall of Famers like Lombardi, (Chuck) Noll
and (Bud) Grant.''
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia's firing of Coach Ray Rhodes was so friendly that
owner Jeffrey Lurie opened the news conference by saying, ``Wow,
what a crowd. You'd think it was a Rolling Stones concert or
something.''
</P>
<P>
   Denver running back Terrell Davis, on reaching 2,000 yards: ``It
was almost like winning a Super Bowl again.''
</P>
<P>
   A banner at the Ravens' regular-season finale a week ago read,
``Hey, Cleveland, we'd rather have the expansion team.'' &QL;  &QL;

DIXIE GETS ITS KICKS FROM FOOTBALL 
</HEADLINE>
  FB-AZR   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By KENT SOMERS  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Atlanta sports bar was subdued as fans from Mississippi
State and Tennessee ate quietly while watching games on the
big-screen televisions.
</P>
<P>
   It apparently was a little too quiet for one Mississippi State
fan, who suddenly stood on the rungs of a bar stool and, in a voice
reminiscent of Foghorn Leghorn, yelled: `Oooooooweeeee, looks like
there might be some Dogs in here!''
</P>
<P>
   As if possessed, seemingly normal, mild-mannered folks quickly
swallowed whatever they were eating and responded the only way they
knew how. They barked. Loudly. Deeply. Passionately.
</P>
<P>
   Their beloved Bulldogs were only eight hours away from playing
Tennessee in the Southeastern Conference Championship.
</P>
<P>
   Most rational Southerners will admit they play some decent
football in other parts of the country. But when it comes to
undying passion, unquestioned loyalty and unconditional love for
high school and college football, there is no place like the
Southeastern part of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   They still pack high school stadiums on Friday nights. On
Saturday afternoons, they ring cowbells, sing ``Rocky Top,'' do the
tomahawk chop and fill stadiums from Tennessee to Florida and from
Louisiana to South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   Seven Southeastern schools ranked among the country's top 10 in
average attendance this season. Schools in the Southeastern
Conference averaged about 69,000 in attendance, 19,000 more than
the Pac-10.
</P>
<P>
   It is a different world out West. The University of Arizona and
Arizona State can't sell out, even when one team is ranked in the
Top 10. In its Rose Bowl season, Washington State couldn't pack its
small stadium. And if a UCLA fan ever hopped up on a bar stool and
growled like a Bruin, his brethren would choke on their Chardonnay.
</P>
<P>
   Florida State assistant coach Chuck Amato has coached at North
Carolina State and Arizona and has seen the differences firsthand.
When he was at Arizona, the Wildcats traveled to play Southern
California in the Los Angeles Coliseum one year. The Trojans were
ranked No. 1, and Marcus Allen, who went on to win the Heisman
Trophy, was a senior.
</P>
<P>
   On the Friday before the Saturday afternoon game, the Rolling
Stones drew about 105,000 for a concert in the Coliseum. On
Saturday night, they drew another 100,000 people. In between, the
football game drew 40,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `Yeah, we were the halftime show for the Rolling
Stones,' '' Amato said. ``That wouldn't have been that way (in the
South). In Tallahassee, they have three seasons: football,
recruiting and spring practice. It's a passion down there.'' &QL; 
Region of champs &QL;
</P>
<P>
   That passion is not only displayed in attendance figures but in
championships. In six of the past 11 years, a Southern team has won
a national championship. That number is likely to grow to seven
this year because No. 1 Tennessee is playing No. 2 Florida State in
the Fiesta Bowl on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Like ingredients for jambalaya, there are many reasons for the
South's passion. None is more important than the others, but each
one adds something to the mix.
</P>
<P>
   Some will say it's a result of the region's lack of professional
teams for many years. Some will say it's because football was
something Southerners could take pride in when economic times were
hard and the region was being negatively portrayed nationally.
Others maintain that the passion has roots in the Civil War and
Reconstruction, when many of the SEC schools started as land-grant
institutions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why is it more a part of the fabric of life than any other
area? I don't know that you can say, `Here's the reason,' '' said
John Ward, who is retiring after more than 30 years of broadcasting
Tennessee's games. ``There are a lot of underlying reasons that go
back certainly half a century or more.''
</P>
<P>
   In his 23 seasons at Florida State, Coach Bobby Bowden's teams
have played in nearly every large stadium in the country. He has
never experienced fans who have stronger emotional ties to football
teams than in the South.
</P>
<P>
   ``People in the Southeastern part of the United States that were
defeated in the Civil War, it's their nature to have something to
ride on, a football team or something,'' Bowden said. ``I think we
put too much into it, actually. People have put too much of their
priorities into football.``
</P>
<P>
   Rivalries become blood feuds. In seasons such as this one, when
Florida State has beaten Florida and Miami, Bowden can travel
through the state peacefully. He has said many times that Seminoles
fans would rather beat Florida than win a national championship.
</P>
<P>
   Bowden received a letter recently from an old friend who wrote
that the coach had it exactly right.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, `If you win a national championship, that's a matter
of opinion. But if you have a victory over Florida, that's a cold,
hard fact,' '' Bowden said. ``I thought that was pretty clever.'' &QL; 
Who are you? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Fans choose loyalties at an early age. Kids in Alabama often
become Crimson Tide fans or Auburn fans before grade school. In
Florida, they pick between Florida State, Florida and Miami. The
same holds true with Mississippi and Mississippi State, Georgia and
Georgia Tech, South Carolina and Clemson.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're either Alabama or Auburn,'' said Frank Sanders, a
receiver for the Cardinals who grew up in Fort Lauderdale and
played at Auburn. ``Either you're Florida or Florida State. Who are
you? They always want to make the distinction. What are you, and
what do you believe?''
</P>
<P>
   Florida State quarterback Marcus Outzen of Fort Walton Beach,
Fla., has wanted to be a Seminole for as long as he can remember.
At 12, Outzen was thrilled the day he received an autograph from
Bowden. Tennessee kicker Jeff Hall of Winchester, Tenn., grew up a
Volunteers fan and treasured a jersey with No. 19 on it, the same
number worn by Tennessee quarterback Jeff Francis.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the Bible Belt, people are loyal to a lot of things, and
football is one of them,'' Hall said.
</P>
<P>
   Florida State offensive lineman Jason Whitaker grew up in Panama
City, Fla., where autumn weekends were comprised of two social
events.
</P>
<P>
   ``You watched college football on Saturdays and NASCAR on
Sundays,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In Tennessee, there really is no other game in town. The
Volunteers drew an average of almost 107,000 fans to home games
this season, and their radio broadcasts are carried by 80 stations
throughout Tennessee and parts of Alabama, Kentucky and North
Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   When Tennessee quarterback Peyton Manning didn't win the Heisman
Trophy last year, Volunteers fans were outraged, as if someone had
attacked the family's honor.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is an emotional commitment among fans here,'' Ward said.
``Life's milestones are measured not by the fact that our daughter
was born Oct. 17, 1982. She was born the year Tennessee broke an
11-year losing streak to Alabama. It's a reference point for life.
Children are named after players. I don't know how many Peytons
there are in Tennessee, but there's a lot more this year than there
were five years ago.'' &QL; 
Reconstruction roots &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ward thinks the roots of the passion reach back to
Reconstruction, when many SEC universities started as land-grant
institutions. Universities had extension agents in nearly every
county, and they worked closely with farm families, giving them a
direct connection to the universities.
</P>
<P>
   The schools were open to anyone in the state, and 50 years ago,
it was a major financial undertaking for many families to send a
child to college. That strengthened the emotional investment in the
university and its athletic teams.
</P>
<P>
   And later, the improvement in interstate roads made traveling to
games easier. What was a seven-hour drive from Memphis to Knoxville
became a little more than a four-hour trip.
</P>
<P>
   The passion also has racial overtones. Gene Stallings, who
played and coached at Alabama, once said that one reason Alabamans
were so passionate about football is that it was one thing in which
they could be proud.
</P>
<P>
   The state was poor economically and troubled socially. The only
thing many Americans knew about Alabama was that Gov. George
Wallace once stood at the doors of the University of Alabama and
vowed not to let Black students attend the school. The football
team, coached by Paul ``Bear'' Bryant, gave residents a reason to
be proud. &QL; 
Learning early &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Southern kids learn early that football is important. Sanders
remembers choosing among three different youth organizations in
Fort Lauderdale, each with several different leagues based on age
and ability. In his high school league, the abundance of talent was
unbelievable. Sanders, for instance, played on the same team as
Isaac Bruce, a star receiver for the St. Louis Rams.
</P>
<P>
   Football can't get any bigger than it is in Thomasville, Ga.,
about 35 miles north of Tallahassee, Fla. Thomasville County
Central High has won state championships in five of the past seven
seasons and even has its own football web site.
</P>
<P>
   If you visit the school's lunchroom on Monday evenings, you'll
find members of the booster club reviewing game film. Details of
games played by the seventh grade, eighth grade, junior varsity and
varsity teams are available at the click of the mouse.
</P>
<P>
   ``Football is as big here as it can get,'' said George Mathes,
who owns George's and Louie's Restaurant, which specializes in
fresh seafood from the Florida coast.
</P>
<P>
   Mathes, too, is a football fan, but he'll be glad to see the
college season end Monday night with the Fiesta Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the games are on, it really affects business,'' he said.
``People just stay home and watch television.'' &QL;

 NEW YORK: be successful.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   For their part, state officials have temporarily set aside the
idea of building 200,000 square feet of retail space as part of the
station, which was proposed to help finance the project. ``The
short-term compromise will help us achieve a greater development in
the future,'' said Charles A. Gargano, chairman of the
redevelopment agency and its corporate parent, Empire State
Development Corp. Among other things, that compromise helped pave
the way for the Dec. 21 accord.
</P>
<P>
   ``It means we are definitely going to move forward,'' Gargano
said.
</P>
<P>
   Six years have already passed since a plan was first announced
to improve Amtrak's passenger areas by building a new concourse in
the General Post Office.
</P>
<P>
   ``It occurred to me that there was a monumental building that
kind of looked like a station right above the platforms,'' recalled
Fred Bartoli, the manager of high-speed rail and facility programs
in Amtrak's Metropolitan Division.
</P>
<P>
   What made the idea so appealing was that it offered a kind of
redemption for the demolition of the original station. ``You don't
get a second chance like this often,'' said Sen. Daniel Patrick
Moynihan.
</P>
<P>
   Designed by McKim, Mead &AMP; White, the Farley Building opened in
1914 as a companion piece to the station. A Ninth Avenue annex was
added in 1935. Above a portico of tree-sized Corinthian columns is
inscribed the famous ``Neither snow nor rain'' motto. The Farley
Building was one of the earliest designated landmarks, protected by
a law that had been prompted in part by the demolition of the
station across the street.
</P>
<P>
   In retrospect, the inscription was a bit of a warning sign.
Postal officials are quite attached to the Farley Building; not
only because it has vast work floors and dozens of truck bays but
because it is a national cynosure, the grandest of the grand old
post offices. Some families have worked in the building for two or
three generations.
</P>
<P>
   Because it was moving some operations out of Farley to the
Morgan General Mail Facility annex at Ninth Avenue and 29th Street,
the Postal Service had subscribed nominally to the station
expansion plan from the outset. But the path from generalities to
specifics turned out to be tortuous.
</P>
<P>
   Postal officials were offended by what they regarded as cavalier
incursions into their space by people who had no idea how a post
office operated. And they resented implications that the General
Post Office was inefficient or unnecessary.
</P>
<P>
   ``It probably wasn't being utilized to its fullest efficiency,''
Umscheid said, ``but the fact is that there has been a growth in
mail volume and services over time.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, economic development officials and civic leaders were
growing impatient with what they saw as bureaucratic intransigence
impeding the conversion of an antiquated structure into an urban
dynamo.
</P>
<P>
   ``Postal Service bureaucrats go, well, they go postal when the
plan is mentioned,'' said a 1997 editorial in The Daily News, whose
offices are near the Farley Building.
</P>
<P>
   By late 1997, horns were locked. The Postal Service insisted it
could not give up more than one quarter of the Farley Building
(350,000 square feet) and the redevelopment agency insisted it
would need half.
</P>
<P>
   The Municipal Art Society went so far as to propose emptying
Farley of all postal operations except the service windows on
Eighth Avenue and turning it into a station, civic center, postal
museum and mall.
</P>
<P>
   The White House dispatched Peck, of the Federal Public Buildings
Service, to broker a compromise. ``Shuttle diplomacy wasn't
working,'' he said. ``It was more like long-range shelling.''
</P>
<P>
   In August, Pennsylvania Station Redevelopment Corp. designated
an architectural and engineering team headed by Skidmore, Owings &AMP;
Merrill and Parsons Brinckerhoff, with Castro-Blanco Piscioneri &AMP;
Associates, Hardy Holzman Pfeiffer Associates and Ove Arup &AMP;
Partners.
</P>
<P>
   A joint management committee was also formed that month,
bringing postal officials and state officials to the same table.
``There is a different tone now,'' Peck said. ``They're fully
committed.''
</P>
<P>
   Both sides credit the architects with helping them find the
common ground necessary to apportion the building. ``S.O.M. has
been key in putting on their wisdom-of-Solomon hats,'' Umscheid
said.
</P>
<P>
   Marilyn Jordan Taylor, a partner in the Skidmore firm, likened
the process to solving a three-dimensional jigsaw puzzle, made
easier to solve because ``a lot of people in the post office rolled
up their sleeves and were ready to take a fresh look.''
</P>
<P>
   One big piece of the puzzle was the truck docks on the ground
floor, which an earlier redevelopment plan had proposed to
eliminate in favor of a pedestrian arcade. ``Without the docks, the
building has no functional value,'' said David Eales, the manager
of realty assets for the Postal Service.
</P>
<P>
   John D.T. Gerber, senior vice president of the redevelopment
corporation, said there was a ``great deal of competition'' for the
ground-floor space.
</P>
<P>
   The solution involves the construction of new loading docks
below grade, while keeping some supplemental docks on the ground
floor level for extra-long tractor-trailer trucks that could not
make a sharp turn on the ramps. Reducing the area of the
ground-floor docks will permit construction of a grand ticketing
hall.
</P>
<P>
   For the time being, at least, the Postal Service will not be
ceding more than 350,000 square feet, although it acknowledges that
it may be possible to move other operations out of the Farley
Building over time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our plans describe a project of independent utility that we
can begin very shortly,'' said Alexandros E. Washburn, president of
the redevelopment corporation. ``That doesn't preclude us from
weighing options for the eventual reuse of the entire Farley
Building.
</P>
<P>
   ``Postal operations seem to me more and more a form of
transportation,'' he said. ``And what we are basically trying to do
is improve transportation for New York City.''
</P>
<P>
   An advocacy group called the Committee for Better Transit fears
that the Farley concourses may create as many problems as they
solve. Among their concerns is that moving Amtrak across Eighth
Avenue will make it harder to reach from the Sixth and Seventh
avenue subways, leading in turn to more taxi and auto trips,
thereby worsening traffic and air pollution.
</P>
<P>
   Amtrak also has concerns about the mid-block ticketing hall.
``It has to look like a main entrance,'' Bartoli said. At the same
time, it cannot compete too strongly with the renowned Eighth
Avenue facade.
</P>
<P>
   The railroad expects some back-and-forth over the arrangement of
ticket counters and the location of stairways, elevators and
escalators. But it is generally satisfied with the plans drawn up
by the redevelopment corporation, Bartoli said.
</P>
<P>
   Walter R. Ernst, the general manager of Amtrak's Metropolitan
Division, recalled that the project could be traced to a need,
recognized a decade ago, for better access to the platforms below
and more waiting room in the station above. ``When the Farley
project is completed,'' he said, ``you'll have greatly improved
vertical circulation.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody needs to deal with the problem of making Penn
Station better able to handle significant peaking levels of
passengers,'' Ernst said. Designed for a steady flow of intercity
trains through the day, the station was not equipped to handle
waves of commuter trains discharging or boarding more than 1,000
passengers at once.
</P>
<P>
   Other projects have been undertaken to improve conditions.
</P>
<P>
   The LIRR, which operates 542 of the 882 trains that run through
the station every weekday, completed a $190 million renovation in
1994. Designed by TAMS, it includes a new central corridor, a new
vaulted ceiling for the connecting corridor and more platform
access. A 90-foot-high entrance structure on 34th Street, by R.M.
Kliment &AMP; Frances Halsband Architects, restored some small sense of
the station as an important gateway. The LIRR also built the West
End Concourse to Tracks 13 through 21.
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey Transit, which operates 219 trains daily, has begun a
$105 million waiting room and East End Concourse, to open in 2001.
A steel canopy over the concourse, leading to Tracks 1 through 12,
is meant to evoke somewhat the look of the old station. The
architects are Sverdrup &AMP; Parcel.
</P>
<P>
   Amtrak, which operates 121 trains daily, has begun a $37.5
million renovation of the existing concourse, including three new
escalators and a waiting area for passengers boarding the
high-speed trains that are to begin running along the Northeast
Corridor later this year. The architects are Hellmuth, Obata &AMP;
Kassabaum.
</P>
<P>
   All but invisible to passengers is another critical improvement,
the $100 million upgrade to a switching and signaling system that
was essentially unchanged since the station opened in 1910.
</P>
<P>
   The work done by five control towers in Manhattan and Long
Island City, Queens, has been consolidated in a computerized
operating ``theater'' at the Claytor-Scannell Control Center at
Ninth Avenue and 31st Street, a joint venture between Amtrak and
the LIRR. It opened in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Dispatchers work at consoles in front of a 70-foot-long
illuminated board that shows the position of every train coming
into or out of Pennsylvania Station, from Morrisville, Pa., to New
Rochelle, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Impressive as this center is, it would not be enough in itself.
``Whatever is done to improve the signal system goes for nought,''
Ernst said, ``if you can't deliver people and get them off the
platforms quickly.''

 &HT;    Florida law leans in to protect love and marriage
 &HT;    By Pat Moore
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Florida couples must consider the
consequences of divorce before they can get married under a new law
that court clerks predict will create more turmoil than romance.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be a fiasco,'' said deputy court clerk Kelly
Lamb, supervisor of the St. Lucie County's family services
division, of the law that becomes effective today.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to have people very unhappy and afraid,'' she
said. ``It's not going to be simple for someone to come in here and
get a marriage license anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Before court clerks will issue a marriage licenses, the
prospective brides and grooms must read a 16-page booklet telling
them how a court would divide their assets and how child support
payments could be ordered if they ever split.
</P>
<P>
   Then, the couple must wait three days after receiving the
license to get married, according to the law designed to reduce the
divorce rate statewide.
</P>
<P>
   Marriage licenses will be available for $56 instead of the
normal $88.50 fee for couples who attend four-hour courses designed
to improve communication, financial and parenting skills before
marriage.
</P>
<P>
   But Treasure Coast couples won't be able to cash in on the
savings _ at least not yet.
</P>
<P>
   Court clerks in Martin and St. Lucie counties say the only
agencies offering the ``premarital preparation course'' are from
St. Augustine, Pembroke Pines and Pensacola. The clerks say they
will not sign up people for the class, but will refer couples to
the agencies to make arrangements.
</P>
<P>
   The Pembroke Pines agency, Pairs International Inc., notified
clerks they are offering the course at $40 per person.
</P>
<P>
   ``That means couples would have to pay $80 to attend a course to
get a $32.50 discount on a marriage license,'' said Martin County
deputy clerk Lisa DeLoach, supervisor of the family services
division. ``I don't think they'll be lining up at the door for
that.''
</P>
<P>
   DeLoach said a Martin County minister made inquiries about
beginning a class, but nothing will be in place when the law takes
effect.
</P>
<P>
   The law, sponsored by state Sen. Tom Rossin, D-West Palm Beach,
does allow court clerks to waive the three-day waiting period for
``hardship'' cases, but it does not specify what constitutes a
hardship, she said.
</P>
<P>
   While Florida residents wait three days to get married,
out-of-state couples may still obtain instant courthouse
ceremonies. But they will be required to read the booklet warning
them of ramifications of divorcing.
</P>
<P>
   Angry reaction the law began last week, DeLoach said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got a call from one man saying he wasn't paying $500 to fly
here from New York and read some stupid book before he gets
married.''

GOVERNMENT WITNESS: MAKE WINDOWS A PUBLIC UTILITY Moving in (f)
financial and (w) Washington queues. By ANDREW J. GLASS c.1999 Cox
News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ To lift the ``choke point'' that Microsoft Corp.
holds over Internet commerce, the federal courts should treat
Windows, the dominant operating system for personal computers, like
a telephone dial tone, a key government witness will argue when the
historic antitrust case against the software giant resumes on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   William Harris, chief executive and president of Intuit Inc.,
maker of the popular Quicken personal-finance software, advances
his remedy of ``operating system neutrality'' in 47 pages of direct
written testimony. Microsoft's lawyers will cross-examine Harris,
the 11th of the government's allotted 12 witnesses in the landmark
trial, which was recessed for the holidays.
</P>
<P>
   After the Department of Justice and 19 states rest their case,
probably in mid-January, Microsoft will present its 12 defense
witnesses _ reserving the right to call chairman Bill Gates as a
surprise rebuttal figure in the trial's final phase.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Windows operating system is to computer users and
providers of software applications or Internet services what the
dial tone is to businesses and customers using the telephone: it's
the thing you must have access to if you are going to communicate
with each other,'' Harris wrote.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless the court limits Microsoft's ability to expand the
Windows choke point into the Internet, Microsoft's ability to be
the gatekeeper of the Internet will be unchallenged, and
competition on the Internet will be constrained,'' he contended.
</P>
<P>
   ``Such a result will have implications far beyond the software
industry, as the Internet is rapidly becoming a major conduit for
communications and commerce generally,'' Harris added.
</P>
<P>
   Likening Windows to a public utility, Harris held that
Microsoft's control of the operating system market exerts a huge
pull over how independent software vendors conduct business,
including his own firm.
</P>
<P>
   Bowing to the superior market power of Windows, Harris reported,
Intuit reluctantly signed a deal with Microsoft to promote its
Internet Explorer browser _ one that required Intuit ``to forgo any
business relationships with Netscape [Communications Corp.],
because Microsoft guaranteed Intuit placement on the Windows
desktop for Intuit's Internet-based products and services.''
</P>
<P>
   Harris' proposed treatment of Windows as a public utility stems
from a body of antitrust case law known as the essential facility
rule, which has been most often applied in railroad right-of-way
disputes.
</P>
<P>
   It could come into play only during the remedy phase of the
trial should U.S. District Court Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson, who
is hearing the case without a jury, find that Microsoft's business
practices violated the 1890 Sherman Antitrust Act.
</P>
<P>
   Harris underscored Intuit's dependence on the Windows operating
systems because it is ``essential and unique.'' In his discussion
of software industry economics, he noted that ``no other piece of
software has the same centrality and necessity.''
</P>
<P>
   As a leading maker of personal finance, tax and small business
accounting software, Intuit sought a merger with Microsoft in 1994,
until antitrust officials frowned on the planned accord. But Harris
wrote that Intuit pursued that deal out of fear that Microsoft
would leverage its monopoly power to champion its own accounting
product, Microsoft Money, and drive Intuit to the wall.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, Microsoft cast itself as a defender of open
competition in a free marketplace. It characterized Harris'
proposed ``operating system neutrality,'' remedy as an ``entirely
new and irrelevant concept.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The only 'fact' that comes out of Mr. Harris testimony is that
Intuit wishes to use its testimony as an attempt to circumvent
competition in the marketplace by using the government and the
courts against Microsoft.'' The company, it said, ``is competing on
the basis of technology and value, but Intuit seems to be trying to
use the government and the courts to tip the scales against
Microsoft.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Harris wants to have his cake and eat it too,'' the
Microsoft statement concluded. ENDIT &LR;  &QL;

   GA-MILLER _ ATLANTA _ As Zell Miller leaves the political
spotlight after more than 30 years, including eights as governor,
his popularity among Georgians is the highest for a governor since
polling began. Immediately upon taking office, he embarked on his
get-tough on criminals promises and built his plan for a Georgia
lottery, which was approved toward the end of his first term. ``I
plowed deep the first term, and smoothed it out the second term,''
Miller said in an October interview. The national political
audience met him as one of the keynote speakers at the 1992
Democratic National Convention, when he delivered a fiery address
laiden with echoes of the Democratic Party's roots in Roosevelt and
social responsibility. But three weeks later, The New York Times
called him an ``unidentified man'' in a front-page photo of Clinton
walking with governors at a National Governors Association meeting.

 &HT;    Leaving behind a plowed field
 &HT;    By Kathey Pruit
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Pairs of spare cowboy boots sit on a garage shelf,
their dog-eared tops neatly aligned, while boxes of books waiting
to be unpacked mark a narrow trail to the back door of the rock
house his mother built more than six decades ago.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Zell Miller has moved back home.
</P>
<P>
   Back to the house perched just above a multilaned highway
bearing his name that helped open Georgia's mountain communities.
Back to the college classroom to teach his first loves: history and
politics. Back to the saw-toothed hills that molded the man leaving
office as the state's most popular governor since political polling
began.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm doing exactly what I planned to do all along,'' Miller
said as he and his wife, Shirley, begin the transition back to
private life. ``No melancholy. No nostalgia. I've always known I
was going back home.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller, 66, leaves a legacy that historians say ensures his
place _ at the front of the line, many insist _ among the state's
most successful governors. His lottery-funded HOPE scholarship
program has sent nearly 357,000 Georgians to college, and helped
push his approval rating to an astounding 85 percent.
</P>
<P>
   His pre-kindergarten program, also lottery-funded, has prepped
246,200 youngsters for the classroom. And Georgia now boasts some
of the nation's toughest laws on repeat felons and drunken drivers,
and the highest ratings for financial stability.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wrote the book on modern-day political leadership,'' said
Keith Mason, who as a teenager volunteered in Miller's earlier
political campaigns and later became his top adviser in the
governor's office.
</P>
<P>
   But during Miller's first few years as governor, that book may
have seemed more like a chronicle of political misadventures.
</P>
<P>
   After 16 years as lieutenant governor, Miller walked into the
state's top office in the midst of a recession. With state revenue
shrinking and the state reserve fund depleted, the choices were
simple and distasteful: Cut the budget or raise taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Summoning lawmakers back to Atlanta for a special summer
legislative session, Miller put a quick end to his honeymoon in
office as he pared hundreds of millions of dollars from the state
budget and axed thousands of state jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was so unpopular in 1991 that I had to cancel the
commencement speech at (the University of Georgia) in Athens,''
Miller recalls.
</P>
<P>
   With the budget crisis averted, the new governor began making
good on his promises to get tough on criminals and bolster
education.
</P>
<P>
   Drawing on his much-touted Marine sergeant's background, Miller
capitalized politically by funding a series of boot camp-styled
prisons for young nonviolent offenders. Today, the camps have been
abolished or have evolved into other types of incarceration
programs. He set about building the framework for a state lottery
to fund college scholarships and pre-kindergarten for 4-year-olds.
And he launched crusades to eliminate the tax on groceries and to
clamp down on drunken driving.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you've got to do early on is plow deep,'' Miller advised
a new governors conference in Wilmington, Del., shortly after the
November 1998 elections. ``Then you can spend your later years
smoothing it up.''
</P>
<P>
   Often, those colorful mountain metaphors or county music lyrics
were the tools Miller used to till Georgia's rocky political soil.
Singer Merle Haggard's musings about ``drinking that free Bubble-Up
and eating that rainbow stew'' were part of Miller's call in the
early '90s to put the state budget on a crash diet. But there were
other tools, such as the quick temper that flared often in his
legislative battles as lieutenant governor against House Speaker
Tom Murphy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like a sibling rivalry,'' a mellower Miller now
recalls. ``He could play off me to get things he wanted in the
House, and I could play off him to get things I wanted.''
</P>
<P>
   For Miller, who watched his mother work to pay off his college
loan and who saw mountain friends struggle to make ends meet
because they couldn't find good jobs in his native Towns County,
his vision for Georgia was clear once he became governor.
</P>
<P>
   He wanted a state in which rural areas enjoyed the same economic
success as the urban centers, where all children could obtain a
good education if they worked hard enough and where issues like
crime and taxes were tackled with the same wisdom common folk used
in discussions around the kitchen table.
</P>
<P>
   But top advisers remember it also took some ``major
arm-twisting'' inside and outside the Capitol to push through the
hallmark programs that now define Miller's administration.
</P>
<P>
   A lottery devoted to education would be immensely popular among
two-thirds of Georgians, Miller's strategists advised at the time.
But the other third ``will take your hide off,'' his pollster, Alan
Secrest warned. Miller took the chance, and pushed for a
constitutional amendment on the November 1992 ballot.
</P>
<P>
   The resistance was immediate and loud. Business leaders backed
away from the plan, newspapers panned it. Opposition grew so strong
that Miller couldn't attend church on Sundays without getting an
earful.
</P>
<P>
   ``We couldn't even get a resolution from college presidents to
support the lottery that fall,'' Mason said.
</P>
<P>
   Now, many of the critics are converts. Even some who still
object to the lottery recognize how far HOPE has reached into
households.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nothing but a tax on the poor,'' said the Rev. Creede
Hinshaw, who spoke against the lottery from his church in Columbus.
Yet, ``as conflicted as I am by the belief that it's wrong, I've
got one boy going to school in Georgia on a HOPE scholarship and a
second son who is hoping to,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The widespread success of the HOPE scholarship thrust Miller _
and Georgia _ into the national spotlight. President Bill Clinton,
a longtime friend, borrowed the Georgia program's guidelines and
its name for a national HOPE scholarship announced in his 1997
State of the Union address.
</P>
<P>
   But just as lottery-for-education buoyed Miller following his
turbulent first years as governor, an even more controversial
proposal _ changing the state flag _ threatened to sink his
aspirations for a second term.
</P>
<P>
   It was, Miller admits now, a classic example of doing exactly
what he'd long preached against _ getting sidetracked by a social
cause unrelated to kitchen-table issues.
</P>
<P>
   But with the 1996 Olympics three years away, Miller said he was
worried that the Confederate battle emblem on Georgia's flag would
taint the state's international perception.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a lot of wasted time,'' he admits now. ``My
obstinance in holding onto that position for so long has probably
caused a situation to develop where you couldn't do it now for
years.'' Miller's proposal misfired, and his popularity dipped to
its lowest point. His floor leaders couldn't marshal the
legislative votes to make the change.
</P>
<P>
   Smelling blood in 1994, Republicans turned to multimillionaire
Atlanta businessman Guy Millner for a well-financed bid for the
governorship, seeking to mount a strong challenge against a wounded
governor. Even to some of Miller's confidantes, his re-election
prospects looked grim.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can only walk one step ahead of the people,'' said Bob
Short, one of Miller's basketball teammates at Young Harris College
who later helped the future governor get a job in former Gov.
Lester Maddox's administration. ``At times, Zell's tried to get 10
yards ahead. During those times, he's suffered the most.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the election, with the GOP gaining political momentum
nationwide, Pat Jarvis, a former Atlanta Braves' pitcher and one of
Miller's close friends, offered a shred of optimism from a
conversation overheard at a Willacoochee convenience store as
Miller campaigned nearby.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the SOB that's trying to change the flag,'' Jarvis
heard a customer mutter in disgust as he watched Miller outside.
``No,'' the woman behind the counter responded. ``That's the SOB
that's paying my granddaughter's way through college.''
</P>
<P>
   The November election results followed that same grass-roots
sentiment, and Miller narrowly won a second term. It was time to
smooth that plowed field. Over the next four years, Miller
transformed himself into a near political folk-hero who helped seal
the 1998 election for Georgia Democrats by solidifying support
throughout North and South Georgia's rural areas. The man tagged as
the liberal Zig Zag Zell because he was accused of flip-flopping
positions in his earlier bids for Congress and the U.S. Senate _
and even in his first term as governor _ worked to shed the label
as he saw the nature of the national electorate changing. The new,
politically astute Miller morphed into the kind of fiscally
conservative Democrat that even suburban Republicans could embrace.
</P>
<P>
   His moves to reform welfare, to remove the state sales tax from
groceries and to get tougher on crime by strengthening DUI laws and
imposing ``two strikes and you're out'' for repeat offenders stole
key Republicans issues. Tougher still for the Republicans was
knowing that they had to back the Democratic governor or face the
prospect of being painted as the liberals on their own core issues.
What some would call manipulation, others would call
bridge-building.
</P>
<P>
   ``The governor was probably the first Democrat in the state that
really included people who weren't his own party favorites if he
felt they could make a difference,'' said Johnny Isakson, Miller's
GOP opponent for governor in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   How did Miller become all things to all people, seemingly
overnight? Murphy, his old nemesis, offers a simple answer: ``I
think the governor has lived by polls the last two to three
years,'' he said. (Not surprisingly, Miller disagrees).
</P>
<P>
   Though Murphy believes Miller went too far on welfare reform and
teen driving restrictions, the House Speaker still concedes: ``He's
made a better governor than I thought he would when he was elected
eight years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Even after 38 years in politics, Miller's list of vocal critics
is surprisingly short. The closest most will come to an unpleasant
critique is to point to important issues they say Miller shied away
from.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we've got left for Roy (Barnes) are the things Zell
didn't want to tackle or would not tackle,'' said Rep. Kem Shipp
(R-Kennesaw), head of the Cobb County legislative delegation.
``Traffic. Air quality and water quality surrounding metro Atlanta.
These are all going to be unpopular.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller readily concedes that transportation gridlock, sprawl and
pollution, and the resulting federal highway funding cutoff for
metro Atlanta, are major dilemmas for the new governor. Georgians
weren't ready, he said, to accept the tough solutions early in his
administration, and still may not be. ``You can't take the public
where they don't want to go,'' he said. ``I've tried.''
</P>
<P>
   But environmentalists say he didn't try hard enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``He hasn't been very accessible to environmental groups and his
administration has been very poor on water quality issues,'' said
Bryan Hager, organizer of the Georgia Sierra Club's Challenge the
Sprawl Campaign. But even Hager is quick to temper the criticism.
Miller ``is not what I'd call an environment-friendly governor, but
he's not been out there pushing bad things, either. In the context
of Southern governors, he's been better than average.''
</P>
<P>
   For many Georgians, the complexities and motivations that define
Zell Miller aren't that hard to fathom. They'd heard his mountain
twang and were moved by the story of his mother, Birdie Miller,
widowed 17 days after her son was born, hauling stones from a
mountain creek to build the family's home.
</P>
<P>
   Some came to know Miller first as a young college professor who
emulated his late father, Stephen Grady Miller, first in the
college classroom and later by winning a state Senate seat. Others
watched him mature in two unsuccessful bids to represent the North
Georgia mountains in Congress, and observed his bitter defeat in
1980 in a tough U.S. Senate primary contest against Herman Talmadge
that opened the door to a Republican senator.
</P>
<P>
   Today, keenly aware of his ability to control how his political
exit is portrayed, Miller won't ``stretch out on the couch'' to
discuss touchy-feely ``psycho-babble'' about his life and
administration, he says. But colleagues offer this insight:
Miller's successes are those of a devoted son living out the
aspirations of a hard-working mother and a talented father he never
knew.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it came to political skills, Zell's father had no
peers,'' Bert Lance, a former Carter administration official and
Miller's grade school seatmate, recalls hearing his own father say.
``I've always felt that throughout his lifetime, Zell was growing
toward those inherited qualities from his dad.''
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the nation first became acquainted with Miller at
the same time it embraced another Southern governor, Bill Clinton,
during the 1992 Democratic National Convention in New York.
</P>
<P>
   And Miller, so sick from strep throat that day that he'd spent
hours in bed before his keynote address, gave them a stem-winder by
way of introduction.
</P>
<P>
   ``George Bush just doesn't get it,'' Miller told the approving
crowd. ``If the `education president' gets another term, even our
kids won't be able to spell potato. If the `law and order
president' gets another term, the criminals will run wild because
our commander-in-chief talks like Dirty Harry, but acts like Barney
Fife.''
</P>
<P>
   Pundits declared Miller _ with a voice ``more barbed-wire than
honeysuckle'' _ a vibrant, emerging spokesman for the party's
moderate wing. Talk quickly began of a future for him in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Only The New York Times managed to briefly puncture the bubble
of Miller's newfound national celebrity. A few weeks after the
convention speech in a photo of Miller and other governors walking
alongside Clinton, the newspaper referred to the Georgia governor
as ``an unidentified man.''
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays, ``He's talking point No. 1 in defense of politics and
politicians,'' said James Carville, the consultant Miller helped
make a household name by recommending him to then-presidential
candidate Clinton. ``The New York Times, they don't get beyond the
mountain twang and the odd first name.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller says the same goes for many of the other people _
especially journalists _ who've tried to pigeonhole him.
</P>
<P>
   One of his biggest regrets, Miller said recently, perhaps only
half in jest, is that he never challenged ``someone at the Atlanta
newspapers to duel over their never-ending bigotry toward rural
mountain people.'' It's a chip he's carried on his shoulder since
he first left Towns County as a student bound for Emory University.
</P>
<P>
   Miller resents that reporters often are more interested in his
cowboy boots, his ties to country music legends like George Jones
and Bill Anderson and his lifelong passion for baseball than in his
appreciation of great literature and classical music.
</P>
<P>
   ``In fact, maybe I've played to that,'' Miller conceded
recently, perhaps aware of the image he was perpetuating at that
moment on a recent blustery Saturday, sitting in front of the fire,
stroking his two yellow labs sprawled at his feet, his boot heels
flecked with dried Georgia clay. The dogs are named Gus and
Woodrow, they're a nod toward a favorite Miller novel, ``Lonesome
Dove.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's more to Zell Miller than country music and baseball.
I'm leaving as a governor who I modestly think has changed the
entire culture of this state, certainly the way we look at going to
college,'' he said, stopping short, as he tries to these days, from
launching into one of his legendary harangues. ``It's not been just
in Georgia, but it's had consequences outside this state. I think
there's a time that we stop the quaint character bit.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Miller wants to be asked about his love of classical
music. (A favorite teacher cultivated it with season tickets to the
Atlanta Symphony while he was a student at Emory). He wants to be
asked about his favorite passage of Shakespeare. (Fittingly, it's
from ``Macbeth,'' Act 5, where Macbeth reflects on the queen's
death and her legacy: ``Life's but a walking shadow, a poor player
that struts and frets his hour on the stage and then is heard no
more.'') Miller knows he has left a legacy in state government.
Now, he wants to talk about his future outside politics.
</P>
<P>
   His latest project is within arms' reach. A sofa-side table
brims with books and class notes as the former history professor
prepares for the courses he'll teach later this year at Young
Harris, Emory and the University of Georgia. In a syllabus, Miller
calls his class on leadership ``a combination of philosophy,
literature, history, practical everyday living and Marine Corps
boot camp.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, it was only months ago that political observers doubted
Miller would actually quit politics and return to the classroom.
Instead, they figured, he would challenge Republican U.S. Sen. Paul
Coverdell last November. Or accept a Clinton administration
position, which Miller hints could have been his for the taking.
</P>
<P>
   But after appearing on the ballot 22 times, Miller insists that
ceding the political spotlight was the easiest decision he's ever
made.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm within three years of being 70 years old. I've had my hour
and more upon the stage,'' he said. ``If I were 10 years younger, I
would have wanted to go to Washington, probably...Now I want to do
my teaching, do some writing and try to piece together a
livelihood.

 &HT;    Barnes likely to put taxes, school discipline, health care at
top of Georgia agenda
 &HT;    By Charles Walston
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ When the General Assembly comes to work at the Capitol
next week, the main items on its agenda will sound familiar to
Georgia voters.
</P>
<P>
   They'll be the same priorities Gov.-elect Roy E. Barnes
emphasized in his campaign last year: a reduction in property
taxes, school discipline and health care reform.
</P>
<P>
   A governor typically enters his first Legislative session with a
long list of things to do, and the Legislature usually reads his
election as a mandate for most of those proposals. Barnes, a
veteran legislator who knows his way around the Capitol as well as
any governor in recent memory, will waste no time in tackling his
pet projects.
</P>
<P>
   His promise to gradually increase the homestead exemption to
$50,000 on houses and family farms is a no-brainer. Although some
lawmakers will push their own tax-cut ideas, nobody is likely to
vote against a property tax cut when it finally reaches the floor
of the House and Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes also wants to increase the use of alternative schools for
disruptive students, and to expand after-school programs for middle
school students. His proposed budget, which will be unveiled in the
first week of the session, will include a request for money to fund
those items, according to Bobby Kahn, Barnes' executive secretary.
</P>
<P>
   His pledge to reform managed health care plans, by making them
legally liable for decisions to refuse treatment and forcing them
to offer patients a wider choice of doctors, will be harder to
pass.
</P>
<P>
   The insurance industry has warned that Barnes' proposals could
raise premium costs, a claim he disputes. Many businesses are wary
of Barnes' HMO reform ideas, but health care providers are
generally supportive. The issue promises to be a boon for
lobbyists, who will be hired in droves by insurance companies on
one side, and by doctors, hospitals and lawyers on the other.
</P>
<P>
   While Barnes might not have the full support of the business
community on health care reform, he will devote much of his energy
to another issue important to business leaders - suburban sprawl
and public transportation.
</P>
<P>
   A blue-ribbon group of business and local government leaders
recently recommended seven steps to alleviate the air quality
problems that have frozen most federal highway funding for metro
Atlanta. The panel warned that poor air, traffic gridlock and bad
publicity are stifling growth.
</P>
<P>
   Although Barnes didn't talk about sprawl and gridlock as much as
some other issues during his campaign, he has said that tackling
those problems will be his most important task in this session.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes wants to set up a regional authority to manage public
transportation, and has said an east-west rail link through the
north Atlanta suburbs is a necessary component of any regional
transit plan.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes will also probably request a study of the state's water
needs, as a predicate to establishing a regional water and sewer
authority next year, according to Kahn.
</P>
<P>
   Another issue Barnes wants to address is juvenile justice. Last
year, the state entered into a consent agreement with the U.S.
Department of Justice after a federal probe found overcrowding and
other shortcomings in the state's youth detention system.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes wants to implement more preventive programs for youths
who commit nonviolent crimes, in the hope of deterring them from
more serious offenses. State Rep. Georganna Sinkfield (D-Atlanta),
chairwoman of the House committee on Children and Youth, is among
the influential legislators who favor that approach.
</P>
<P>
   While lawmakers will likely allow Barnes to set the agenda for
the session, they'll still have plenty of proposals of their own.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Charlie Smith (D-St. Marys), who will be the governor's
floor leader in the House, is a strong advocate of greater
accountability in schools. Smith may push a plan to create a
separate office to monitor the performance of schools.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, there has been a debate over whether to abolish
parole, and that almost certainly will continue this year. Barnes
does not favor ending parole for nonviolent crimes, so some
compromise, such as a committee to study ``truth in sentencing,''
could emerge.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, House Republicans repeatedly tried to enact a law
that would prohibit any kind of affirmative action programs. An
example of the type of program that would have been affected is the
admissions policy of the state university system, which considers
the race and gender of some applicants.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans might revisit the issue, but given Barnes' support
for existing affirmative action programs, it seems unlikely that
any such measure will pass this year.
</P>
<P>
   Some Republicans and conservative Democrats might push for a new
measure to outlaw sodomy in the state, after the Georgia Supreme
Court struck down the existing law in November. Such a bill has
virtually no chance of passing, however.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Jim Martin (D-Atlanta), chairman of the House Judiciary
Committee, is opposed to new anti-sodomy legislation, and even
Republicans will be split on the issue, according to GOP leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the Georgia Chamber of Commerce supported a bill that
would have required the losers of lawsuits to pay most legal costs.
The measure failed, but a similar effort is expected this session.
</P>
<P>
   Any forecast of what the General Assembly will be up to for the
next three months must come with a caveat: There is almost always
some issue, barely on the radar screen before the session, that
turns into a major fight.
</P>
<P>
   A few years back, the Legislature battled fiercely over a
proposal that would have prohibited oil refiners from owning
filling stations. Last year, a plan to provide health insurance for
children erupted into a major fight. Even though most lawmakers
supported the idea, there was a division over how to implement it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had some of those issues that looked like smooth
sailing,'' said Bill Lee, the former chairman of the House Rules
Committee who retired from the Legislature this year. ``Then
something always jumps out of the socket.''

 &HT;    Family barred from visiting baby angry at legal system after her
death
 &HT;    By Will Anderson
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Stan and Deborah Layton had seen their granddaughter
only once before last month, when they walked into the hospital
where the 9-month-old was on life support.
</P>
<P>
   An apparent victim of abuse, Bryanna Marie Hollis lay
unconscious in the intensive care unit, hidden from view by a
curtain.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never saw her move,'' Deborah Layton said.
</P>
<P>
   The child's father and the Laytons' son, Donald Cox, 21, was
with her when doctors removed the machines that had kept her alive.
</P>
<P>
   ``The nurse did open Bryanna's eyes for Donald to see. She had
the most beautiful blue eyes. He held her in his arms when life
support was turned off,'' said Stan Layton. ``Everyone in the room
... was in tears. She was a very beautiful baby.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither the Laytons nor Cox could have foreseen what happened to
the little girl. Barred from visiting Bryanna by her mother's
family, the Laytons and Cox didn't even have a photograph of the
child until her death.
</P>
<P>
   Now the Smyrna family is angry at a legal system they say did
nothing to protect Cox's right to see his own child, a right that
if granted might have prevented her death.
</P>
<P>
   On Dec. 23, Cobb County police charged Bryanna's stepfather,
Nicholas Stephen Wood, 20, with murder. A warrant for Wood's arrest
alleges he shook the child repeatedly and banged her head on
various objects while baby-sitting on Dec. 21. Her mother,
19-year-old Stephanie Hollis, phoned 911 from their home in
Mableton and told the dispatcher that Bryanna had stopped
breathing, police reported.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators have declined to release other details about the
child's injuries, but Stan Layton said her left leg was in a cast
from a previous unexplained injury. Her other leg may have been
broken, too, Stan Layton said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't know there was abuse. We never got to know this
little girl,'' said Stan Layton, who is actually Cox's stepfather.
``We were at the hospital when she was born, and the following day
we were told by the mother's family that it would take a court
order for us to see Bryanna again.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Bryanna was born out of wedlock, the Laytons were
willing to do whatever necessary to take part in the child's life.
Their son made a room in their house into a nursery last February _
one month before Bryanna's birth _ complete with a crib, stuffed
toys and her name scrawled on one wall in big wooden letters
painted to match the colors of the nursery. Cox bought toys and
clothes for the little girl, in hopes of being allowed to visit her
on Christmas day. Now Cox wants to donate all the items to a
charity that helps child abuse victims.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can cut here.)
</P>
<P>
   Two months after Bryanna was born, her mother married Wood and
moved away from Cobb County, Stan Layton said. The Laytons sought
legal advice and learned that their son would have to prove
paternity through DNA testing to be able to visit the child. They
also would have to sue for custody. Meanwhile, the state Department
of Human Resources filed a lawsuit on behalf of Bryanna's mother
seeking child support payments.
</P>
<P>
   Efforts to reach Bryanna's mother, Stephanie Hollis, were
unsuccessful.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had to go through all this legal (stuff),'' Stan Layton
said. ``You go for custody hoping you'll get joint custody. We
couldn't see the baby, and we didn't know where they lived.''
</P>
<P>
   The legal wrangling continued until the day Bryanna died. That
day, Stan Layton received a letter from the attorney for Bryanna's
mother, restating the family's intent to prohibit Cox from visiting
the baby. The next day, the attorney called Cox's lawyer to
apologize.
</P>
<P>
   Deborah Layton, the baby's grandmother, said the lawsuit still
hurts. ``We don't want Donny to be considered a deadbeat when he
did everything within the law to be a part of that child's life,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Even after her death, the Laytons and Cox still are fighting for
the child. Deborah Layton has spoken with an attorney to see if
it's legally possible to change Bryanna's last name to Cox even
after her death _ her son's wish. Despite the tragedy, Deborah
Layton said her heart breaks for both sides of Bryanna's family.
</P>
<P>
   ``I cannot imagine the pain she is going through,'' she said.
``I don't know if I could handle knowing that I married a man that
hurt my child.

 &HT;    Fraud, faulty setup alleged by Olympic kiosk investors in
lawsuit
 &HT;    By Jay Croft
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Like countless other businessmen in 1996, Raed Halum
thought he could clear a good return on an Olympics investment.
</P>
<P>
   Halum and four friends and family members pulled together
$270,000 to buy 27 kiosks from which to sell souvenirs around
Atlanta during the Games, anticipating profits of more than $1.35
million.
</P>
<P>
   ``It never happened,'' said Halum, 31, a men's clothing retailer
in New Orleans. ``They took our money and never gave us anything in
return. Nothing _ absolutely nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   Halum and 10 other people and corporations sued, alleging they
had been swindled and seeking at least $6 million. Their case
starts today with jury selection in Fulton County Superior Court.
</P>
<P>
   Defendants include Creative Travel Services, the Peachtree City
company that brought about 3,000 teen-agers from across the country
to work at the souvenir booths. In a well-publicized crisis, the
company could neither feed nor house the youths, who returned home.
</P>
<P>
   That trouble is not at issue in this lawsuit, though it
contributed to the company's difficulties, and the kiosk buyers say
their money was improperly used to tend to those other problems.
</P>
<P>
   Creative Travel and related companies sold scores of kiosks at
$10,000 each to 50 to 75 investors, said Vanessa Vargas, a Chicago
attorney representing the kiosk buyers who sued. Sellers told
investors their split of daily gross sales could reach thousands of
dollars a day, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The losses would have happened anyway,'' even without the
mixup regarding the youths, because the kiosk sellers had not
properly prepared, Vargas said.
</P>
<P>
   Halum and the other kiosk buyers allege fraud, theft by
conversion, misuse of escrow funds and violations of the Georgia
Business Opportunity Act and the state racketeering and corrupt
organizations act.
</P>
<P>
   All of the plaintiffs, including former Miami Dolphin receiver
Mark Clayton and former Atlanta Brave Ryan Bowen, live outside of
Georgia, except one part-time resident. They say the defendants
promoted the kiosk deal falsely and then failed to provide the
goods and services needed to make the booths work properly _
including the booths, themselves.
</P>
<P>
   The plaintiffs say they paid a total of $900,000, which the
defendants used to pay for personal operations and profit.
</P>
<P>
   Creative Travel and other defendants ``had a lot of other
operations going on,'' Vargas said. ``This was where they were
getting all of the cash.''
</P>
<P>
   Defendants' attorneys did not return phone calls or declined to
comment last week.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Freeman, who owned 50 percent of Creative Travel, said
during the Olympics he is an honest man who fell victim to huge
mistakes. He called the experience ``the greatest nightmare of my
life.''
</P>
<P>
   Other defendants include companies the kiosk buyers say were set
up to carry out the sales and their backers. Merle D. Zmak, the
Creative Travel founder, has filed for bankruptcy protection in
Texas and received an automatic stay for protection against
liability in the suit.
</P>
<P>
   In court papers, defendants deny liability. Some say they were
not agents of the corporations or in control of them. Others say
they were acting as corporate officers and are protected by a
``corporate shield,'' committed no fraud and the losses were the
fault of other people and organizations, including the city of
Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   One of the defendant companies, Event Management and Marketing
Associates Inc., is in Chapter 7 bankruptcy protection.

NEW TECHNOLOGY REVIVES OLD DEBATE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By TERESA RIORDAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The technologies may be new, but the debate that promises to
dominate the patent industry this year dates from at least the days
of Thomas Edison and Alexander Graham Bell.
</P>
<P>
   The debate now centers around whether methods of doing business
over the Internet, known as electronic commerce, should be
patentable.
</P>
<P>
   ``A hundred years ago, the Supreme Court struggled with the same
issues that we struggle with today _ how to make our laws
responsive to new technologies,'' said Rick Nydegger, a patent
attorney who represents Microsoft Corp. and other companies and
teaches intellectual property law at Brigham Young University.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question that is being raised with e-commerce was raised
with the telegraph and telephone,'' Nydegger said. ``At the time,
no one had envisioned using electricity as a way to communicate.''
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court is expected to decide in the coming weeks
whether to review a July ruling by the U.S. Court of Appeals for
the Federal Circuit that, according to some patent experts,
represents a potential windfall for those who were among the first
to file electronic commerce patent applications. Although no
statistics are available, many experts speculate that the case,
State Street Bank vs. Signature Financial, has set off a stampede
of new electronic commerce applications to the Patent Office.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling affirmed and broadened earlier court decisions as
well as Patent Office guidelines on software patents, including
electronic commerce patents.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the mid-1980s, when I used to lecture on software patents,
I would get laughed out of the room,'' said Robert Greene Sterne, a
patent attorney in Washington. ``I'd get booed. I'd be called a
capitalist pig by software entrepreneurs who thought it should be
owned by the masses.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, Sterne notes, filings from companies like Microsoft, which
initially rejected the idea of software patents, are tumbling in.
</P>
<P>
   Gregory Aharonian, a patent-search consultant, has long been
critical of the quality of the nation's software patents, and he is
no more sanguine about electronic commerce patents. ``The
e-commerce patents are about as valid as software patents in
general, which aren't very valid to begin with,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Aharonian contends that the Patent Office does not have the
proper resources to research what is known as ``prior art'' _
previous inventions that are similar to a new technology. For
example, he says, a score of software patents have been issued
recently covering solutions to the Year 2000 problem, but none of
them mention a paper on the subject produced by IBM in 1986. Such
oversights make a patent more vulnerable to legal challenges.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's extremely relevant,'' he said. ``But none of the issued
Y2K patents have cited it. That's just gross failure.''
</P>
<P>
   Q. Todd Dickinson, acting commissioner of the Patent and
Trademark Office, says his agency is doing an admirable job and
adds that 20 new patent examiners have been hired recently for the
division responsible for reviewing most electronic commerce
patents.
</P>
<P>
   How successful have patent-wielding companies been in licensing
their electronic commerce technologies so far? It's hard to say:
Patent licenses are not publicly recorded.
</P>
<P>
   Sterne, who represents several dozen software companies, says
patents are important for small enterprises mostly because they
help attract investment capital and provide momentum for initial
stock offerings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Patents are having a major impact on financing,'' he said.
``The investment banking community, the venture capital community
and the angel investing community are becoming very interested in
intellectual property.''
</P>
<P>
   But Aharonian remains skeptical about the value of electronic
commerce patents. ``Until they end up in court, nobody's going to
know whether they're valid,'' he said.

UNFORGETTABLE DANCE IMAGES IN 1998 
 (DW)
</HEADLINE>
  By   JENNIFER DUNNING   
c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Beaming, beautifully dressed women and handsome men
of all ages surged up the stairs and poured out of the elevators to
the promenade of the New York State Theater in November, soon
filling that vast marbled space with laughter, anecdotes and
embraces.
</P>
<P>
   The parade of 50 years of New York City Ballet dancers, gathered
for the alumni reunion that began the company's anniversary
celebrations, might have been a dance lover's fantasy. It was
certainly one of the happiest memories of the dance year of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The faces looked astonishingly familiar, quickly recalling the
articulation and eloquence of their bodies.
</P>
<P>
   Almost no one looked older. But almost all the dancers _ from
the corps to the stars and near-stars of other years _ looked as if
they had found there was life after dance.
</P>
<P>
   Though nothing quite equaled the sumptuousness of this
experience, the year was filled with enough indelible images to
make the memory of dance-going in 1998 contradict those who bemoan
the premature death of the art. Some of the strongest images were
also the quietest.
</P>
<P>
   American Ballet Theater's now-annual fall season at City Center,
a much more intimate setting for the company than its summer home
at the Metropolitan Opera House, had plenty of performing and
choreographic highlights.
</P>
<P>
   Among the choreographic standouts were Twyla Tharp's richly
intriguing ``Known by Heart'' and John Selya's ``Disposition,''
which was revealed as an authoritative and imaginative exploration
of the classical idiom when danced by its second cast. But it is
Anton Dolin's ``Variations for Four,'' a showcase, created in 1957
for British male virtuoso dancing, that stands out most clearly.
</P>
<P>
   It is by now a commonplace to smile over Anna Pavlova's very
deficient technique and the sorry state of British male dancing
before 1956. It was then that the Bolshoi Ballet introduced Soviet
firebrand pyrotechnicists to a male home team relegated by
revisionist ballet history to a dowdiness comparable to the ``mad
old maids in moth-eaten musquash'' who formed, in the words of the
dance writer Richard Buckle, the ballet audiences of the time. The
incandescent, trickily demanding ``Variations for Four'' suggests
not only that there was impressive dancing to be seen in British
ballet but also that pyrotechnics could be just as exciting when
executed with restraint.
</P>
<P>
   There was a similar revelation in Jawole Willa Jo Zollar's
``Hands Singing Song,'' commissioned by the American Dance Festival
and performed there and at the Jacob's Pillow Dance Festival this
summer. Though audiences appear to be increasingly immune to
shock-tactic dance and theater, masturbation is still a reliably
difficult theme for many. But that was the subject of one section
of this suite of dances about hands. It was approached with such
delicacy and graciousness _ without at all camouflaging the
activity _ that the dance was received with a rapt silence and then
applause and cheers.
</P>
<P>
   It will be difficult, too, to forget the revivifying sassiness
of some of the year's most entertaining dance. First on that list
is Matthew Bourne's impudent and surprisingly poignant ``Swan
Lake,'' at the Neil Simon Theater through Jan. 23, a treatment of a
hallowed classic that proved to be an unforgettable dance and
theater experience. And who could forget the men of the Alvin Ailey
American Dance Theater, who managed to be both suave and impishly
sensuous in so much that they performed in the company's just-ended
season at City Center.
</P>
<P>
   The Danspace Project helpfully provided a look back into history
in December in the first of its ``Silver Series'' programs
celebrating 25 years of presenting dance at St. Mark's Church in
the East Village. The vehicle was an onstage speech by Stephen
Facey, a church administrator who welcomed the project and pushed
for it to stay.
</P>
<P>
   Facey, an endearing mix of wit, warmth and idealism, did not
mention the misspent childhood of one of the project's founders,
the leading avant-gardist Barbara Dilley, who began her career as
the Sugar Plum Fairy in a Princeton Ballet Society production of
``The Nutcracker.''
</P>
<P>
   But everything else was there: the unruly, persistent artists
who claimed their space in dance of the 1960's, so much a part of
the vital downtown theater scene of the time, and the hope,
imagination and hard work that went into the building and
rebuilding of the church by local youths chosen for the job because
there had been so little hope, meaningful work and imagination in
their lives.
</P>
<P>
   New York dance also looked to the past in 1998 in Kevin Ward's
luminous ``Offering,'' performed by the Dayton Contemporary Dance
Company at the Joyce Theater in September, in homage to Ward's
beloved teacher and mentor James Truitte, who died in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   May there be a Kevin Ward for at least three of the dance
luminaries who died this year: for the incandescent Svetlana
Beriosova, a star of Britain's Royal Ballet; for Protima Bedi, the
vibrant dance activist who founded the young Nrityagram Dance
Ensemble of India, and for Viola Farber, an early Merce Cunningham
dancer who endowed eccentricity with rare grace.

HOWLS FROM THE PRESS SCUTTLE GOVERNOR'S SECRET ESCAPE PLANS 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 BY STEVE BARNES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LITTLE ROCK, Ark. _ Any politician would covet one, and Gov.
Mike Huckabee of Arkansas almost had one: an escape hatch.
</P>
<P>
   But dismayed by news accounts of the project, Huckabee has
canceled plans to convert an abandoned dumbwaiter shaft in a corner
of his state Capitol office to an emergency exit. The chute,
long-neglected if not forgotten altogether, would have been fitted
with ladder steps and have enabled Huckabee, a Republican, to
decamp the Arkansas statehouse, a Democratic redoubt, without first
leaving his second-floor suite.
</P>
<P>
   The dumbwaiter shaft, dusty, musty and measuring approximately
six feet by three feet, connects to the Capitol's first floor,
where it opens near a legislative committee room.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview on Saturday, Huckabee insisted that the idea
originated with his state police bodyguards, who he said were
alarmed at the lack of an alternative to his office's front door in
the event of a security threat. A state police spokesman declined
to discuss Huckabee's security arrangements.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had nothing to do with it,'' Huckabee said. ``I don't deal
with issues like that.'' But he acknowledged that ``reckless'' news
accounts of the renovation prompted him to order it stopped.
</P>
<P>
   ``The issue became moot when I read about it in the paper,''
Huckabee said. ``There's no security value once it's been published
in the newspaper.''
</P>
<P>
   However, political satirists and Democratic state legislators,
with whom Huckabee has frequently been at odds, found comic value
in the episode. ``A `fraidy hole'!'' smirked one member of the
Arkansas House of Representatives, speaking anonymously. An
editorial cartoon in the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, the state's
largest daily newspaper, suggested the governor install an ejection
seat with parachute in lieu of a ladder.
</P>
<P>
   The architecture of the Arkansas Capitol and the protocol of
parking have led the state's governors invariably to enter and
depart the building through a first floor rotunda that is heavily
traveled by lobbyists, legislators and the public, and requires
them to pass the cramped press room. Not a few governors have
suggested, with a hard smile, that more commodious accommodations
might be found for the State Capitol news corps _ the basement,
perhaps, or even a tent on the lawn.
</P>
<P>
   It would surprise no one in the Arkansas political establishment
if Huckabee shared that view, so thorny have been his relations
with journalists. Since becoming governor following the
Whitewater-related conviction and subsequent resignation of Jim Guy
Tucker in 1996, Huckabee has chafed at news stories he considered
unfair or inappropriate. Many involved the still undisclosed
sources of speaking fees he received while lieutenant governor.
More recently, leaked documents suggesting that Huckabee and his
family paid personal expenses from an expense fund intended to
maintain the governor's mansion have resulted in a pending
taxpayer's lawsuit demanding that he repay the disputed sums.
</P>
<P>
   If such news coverage rankles the governor, the public has
seemed scarcely to notice it, or at least to pay it little mind.
Huckabee won re-election to a full term last November, capturing 60
percent of the vote.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In addition to denying any wrongdoing, Huckabee, an ordained
Southern Baptist minister, has complained of a ``Jerry Springer
mentality'' among journalists and that he is being held to a
different standard than his Democratic predecessors.
</P>
<P>
   Huckabee said any suggestions that he would have used the
aborted exit to escape reporters were ``ludicrous and unfounded.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If I wanted to avoid reporters, there are better ways to do
it,'' Huckabee snipped.
</P>
<P>
   One of his most persistent critics, state Rep. Shane M.
Broadway, a Democrat from Benton, Ark., said in an interview that a
more secure passage from the governor's office was both justified
and overdue. But, added Broadway, ``I think some of it was to avoid
the press. I don't think he has a great trust of you guys.''

BRITAIN KEEPS ITS DISTANCE AS THE EURO IS BORN 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: See also U.S.-EURO and the Outlook article 1999-EURO) 
(mk) 
 By ALAN COWELL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Holding back on the brink as it has at every turn
towards European integration, Britain observed the birth of the
euro single currency as a nation apart this weekend, its leaders
mute even as the banks that power the City of London financial
district prepared to trade the new money by the trillions.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Prime Minister Tony Blair, on vacation in the
Seychelles, nor Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown had
anything to say about the inception of the currency, from which
Britain has initially excluded itself, and which has been cast as
an event of momentous proportions for the 290 million people in the
11 countries participating in it.
</P>
<P>
   If there was a single, historical clue to Britain's reticence it
lay, perhaps, in lines penned almost 70 years ago by Winston
Churchill, which have defined Britain's ambiguity toward the great
land mass across the Channel ever since: ``We are with Europe, not
of it. We are linked but not comprised.''
</P>
<P>
   Britain is by far the most significant _ politically and
economically _ of the four countries outside the euro zone; the
others are Denmark, Sweden and Greece. It is arguably the only
major European power in which public debate about the euro has
flourished _ to such an extent that divisions over Europe provided
one of the many reasons for the defeat of the Conservatives in
1997.
</P>
<P>
   But it is no coincidence that the defining maxim should have
come from Churchill, Britain's wartime leader who rallied a
lonesome nation against the Nazi swamping of Europe in 1940. Then,
as now, in the euroskeptic view, Britain stands alone, its
sovereignty on the line. ``The classic argument'' among the
euro-skeptic newspapers that have driven the discussion, said Peter
Riddell, a newspaper columnist, ``is that it's Britain vs.
Germany'' _ Germany being depicted not just as the bulldozing power
behind the euro's creation, but also as the driving force of a
United States of Europe.
</P>
<P>
   And, as the euro became reality in global electronic trading
Sunday night, those opposed to the new currency raised alarms anew
that the currency is no more than a Trojan horse for a European
super-state in which the essence of British-ness would be lost.
``How can the government keep pretending that it is just about
currencies when the Continentals are clearly out to create a new
country and a new government?'' said John Redwood, a leading
euro-skeptic from the opposition Conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   For all that, no one in financial circles here seemed in the
least bit uncertain that, with such a vast euro market lapping at
its shores, Britain would really escape the tidal pull of the
currency. Even though Britain is outside the euro zone, London
provides Europe's biggest stock, bond and foreign exchange markets.
</P>
<P>
   Swapping pinstripes for blue-jeans, some 30,000 bankers and
back-room staff toiled over the weekend to prepare the trading
floors for an anticipated euro deluge when markets here open
Monday, turning 11 separate European currencies _ from the German
mark to the Spanish peseta _ into expressions of the euro and
converting a mass of financial data in what some depicted as a
less-than-thrilling exercise.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as excitement is concerned, it was a bit of a dud,''
said Rich Silverman, a spokesman for Merrill Lynch. ``You had the
sense that you were part of history. But not every part of history
is exciting.''
</P>
<P>
   The euro's penetration, however, is likely to run deep.
</P>
<P>
   Already, said Grant Phillips, head of the euro program at
Barclays Corporate Banking, some 30,000 British corporations, large
and small, have opened bank accounts in euros with his bank _
Britain's biggest _ alone. Indeed, some leading companies with
Continental business ties have let it be known that they will favor
suppliers who deal in euros, abandoning Britain's cherished pound
sterling. There is even talk of some companies offering euro
salaries to enable British employees to access cheaper mortgages at
the lower euro interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   With this ``creeping euro,'' Phillips said, ``we are fast
getting to the stage of the euro strolling _ if not galloping _
through the British economy.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Such arguments strengthen those who argue that, by abstaining
from the first wave of the euro, Britain is repeating its
historical mistake of denying the inevitable in Europe. ``The
tragedy,'' said the Observer Sunday newspaper in an editorial, ``is
that once again the British political and media establishment have
made sure Britain is not in a vital European project at the
beginning.''
</P>
<P>
   By this argument, Britain is missing out not just on
decision-making about the currency of its main trading area, but
also on a great opportunity for cheaper money in the
low-interest-rate euro zone and cheaper trade in a vast region free
of foreign exchange risks and costs. The counter-argument comes
back to the question of Britain's ability to steer its own economy,
manage its own interest rates and taxes, and preserve its own blend
of low unemployment, low taxes and relatively cheap labor.
</P>
<P>
   The euro, said Lord David Owen, a former Labor foreign
secretary, would mean far greater European ``involvement in tax,
even welfare, hours of work, working conditions.'' And, he said as
he launched a new anti-euro movement Sunday, ``essential parts'' of
British budget-making would ``now be decided in euroland'' _ the
term widely used for the 11 participating countries, which share
fixed common interest rates set by the European Central Bank in
Frankfurt.
</P>
<P>
   The European Central Bank, like most other European financial
institutions, said Sunday that its preparations for the euro had
been completed smoothly. The currency formally came into being on
Jan. 1. Since then, European markets have been closed and many
bankers say the real test of the conversion to the new currency
will come only when major European markets open Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Against all the hoopla surrounding the euro across the Channel,
it seemed typical of Britain's introversion that the main political
issues this weekend related not to the new currency but to
lingering brushfires over the resignation last month of Trade
Secretary Peter Mandelson _ and to a tussle over Blair's decision
to let his children defy government education policy and miss
classes at school this week while they complete their Indian Ocean
vacation.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, though, Blair's government is widely seen as being
friendlier to the euro than its Conservative predecessor, to the
extent, said Riddell, the newspaper columnist, that ``it's when
rather than if with Blair.'' The government's stated policy is to
postpone a decision until a referendum after the next general
election. Under Britain's electoral law, a national election need
not be held until the year 2002 _ a date by which the rest of
Europe will have completed the transition to using euro notes and
coins and much of British business will already be conducted in
euros.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the delay, Blair and his colleagues may be hoping for a
triumph of pragmatism over pride.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most obvious factor is whether the euro is a success,''
said Gerald Segal, director of the International Institute for
Strategic Studies here. ``If he is going to take Britain in, he
needs to be seen as going into a positive exercise.''
</P>
<P>
   But will the euro be a success? Andy Meadows is the curator of
an exhibit at the British Museum charting currency unions from
ancient Greek tridrachms through the silver denarii of the Roman
Empire and on to the euro. History, it turns out, reinforces the
mantra of the market-and-mirrors 1990s. ``If a coin is persuasive,
then people will accept it, and if people accept it, it becomes a
model,'' Meadows said in an interview. And if the marketplace needs
a common currency, ``then the market takes over'' _ euro-watchers,
please note.

   The title of Susan Orlean's artful new report, ``The Orchid
Thief,'' refers to one John Laroche, a 36-year-old Florida man whom
the author describes as ``tall,'' ``skinny'' and ``sharply
handsome'' (``in spite of the fact that he is missing all his front
teeth''), with ``the posture of al dente spaghetti and the nervous
intensity of someone who plays a lot of video games.''
</P>
<P>
   All his life, Ms. Orlean writes, Laroche has been given to
passions that ``arrived unannounced and ended explosively, like car
bombs.'' When a fascination with orchids overtook him, he quickly
became an expert, hired himself out to the Seminole tribe of
Florida to set up a plant nursery and orchid-propagation laboratory
on the tribe's reservation in Hollywood, Fla., and conceived a
scheme that would benefit the Seminoles, the world and himself.
</P>
<P>
   Using the Seminoles' exemption from laws against picking orchids
in the wild, he helped himself to rare specimens growing in a
Florida swamp called the Fakahatchee Strand State Preserve. His
plan was to clone them by the millions, make them available to
fanciers everywhere and thus save them in their wild state by
obviating the need to pick them. Not incidentally he would make a
fortune for the Seminoles and himself. But the law did not agree
and Laroche was arrested and convicted for poaching.
</P>
<P>
   Attracted by an article on Laroche's arrest, Ms. Orlean, a
reporter for The New Yorker, traveled to Florida, befriended
Laroche and got him to introduce her to his world. Near the opening
of ``The Orchid Thief,'' she describes how she approaches her
subjects.
</P>
<P>
   ``I read lots of local newspapers and particularly the shortest
articles in them, and most particularly any articles that are full
of words in combinations that are arresting. In the case of the
orchid story I was interested to see the words `swamp' and
`orchids' and `Seminoles' and `cloning' and `criminal' together in
one short piece. Sometimes this kind of story turns out to be
something more, some glimpse of life that expands like those
Japanese paper balls you drop in water and then after a moment they
bloom into flowers, and the flower is so marvelous that you can't
believe there was a time when all you saw in front of you was a
paper ball and a glass of water.''
</P>
<P>
   In Ms. Orlean's skillful handling, her orchid story turns out to
be distinctly ``something more.'' Getting to know Laroche allows
her to explore multiple subjects: orchids, Seminole history, the
ecology of the Fakahatchee Strand, the fascination of Florida to
con men. She writes that orchids appeal to people because they are
both smart and sexy: smart in their ability to survive; sexy in
their look and feel. She describes the lengths to which collectors
have gone to acquire them. She introduces us to people who deal in
them, steal them, do anything but kill for them.
</P>
<P>
   She tells how the Seminoles arrived in Florida and how to this
day they regard themselves as unconquered by the white man. She
chronicles the horrendous things that have been done to Fakahatchee
by loggers, developers and the introduction of alien flora and
fauna to the area. She captures what she describes as ``a wet,
warm, tropical place, essentially featureless and infinitely
transformable.'' She concludes, ``The flat plainness of Florida
doesn't impose itself on you, so you can impose upon it your own
kind of dream.''
</P>
<P>
   All that she writes here fits together because it is grounded in
her personal experience: patiently befriending the impossible
Laroche, wading the swamp despite a lifelong fear of ooze,
touching, feeling and smelling a variety of orchids. If her
narrative has a flaw, it lies in its occasional tendency to report
certain events and conversations too deadpan, as if it were
self-evident why Ms. Orlean found them whatever way she found them.
This makes for a few tedious stretches.
</P>
<P>
   But most of the time she lets the reader know exactly what she
was feeling. She writes, for instance, that so much obsessiveness
with orchids surrounded her that she became determined not to get
hooked; she would immediately give away any samples that were
presented to her. Yet the more she resisted the more she wanted to
see a sample of the orchid Laroche had stolen and intended to
clone, the elusive Polyrrhiza lindenii, commonly known as the ghost
orchid, apparently the only really pretty orchid in the
Fakahatchee, which in bloom, people told her, ``looks like a flying
white frog _an ethereal and beautiful flying white frog.'' A
charming leitmotif of her book becomes her search for this orchid.
</P>
<P>
   She also became obsessed with obsession. ``I suppose that is
exactly what I was doing in Florida, figuring out how people found
order and contentment and a sense of purpose in the universe by
fixing their sights on one single thing or one belief or one
desire.''
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, of driving through a barren stretch of Florida she
writes: ``I was starting to believe that the reason it matters to
care passionately about something is that it whittles the world
down to a more manageable size. It makes the world seem not huge
and empty but full of possibility. If I had been an orchid hunter I
wouldn't have seen this place as sad-making and vacant _ I think I
would have seen it as acres of opportunity where the things I loved
were waiting to be found.''
</P>
<P>
   This is what Ms. Orlean's portrait of her sometimes sad-making
orchid thief allows the reader to discover: acres of opportunity
where intriguing things can be found. A paper ball that blooms into
orchids.

IN PURSUIT OF MOSES, FROM EXODUS TO `PRINCE OF EGYPT' 
 (DW)
</HEADLINE>
  By   EDWARD ROTHSTEIN   
c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It doesn't take long before we recognize Moses in Dreamworks'
new animated film, ``The Prince of Egypt.'' He is one of us.
</P>
<P>
   He is a rebel without a cause who eventually finds a cause. The
way he finds that cause is not by hearing the Divine voice from the
burning bush but by doing something much more modern. He discovers
his identity. We already are aware of it, of course, since the
movie opens with those archetypal scenes of the Hebrew babe in a
basket rescued from the bulrushes by the Pharaoh's daughter.
</P>
<P>
   But in this film Moses grows up not knowing of his difference.
Yes, he is far more reckless and mischievous than his older
brother, who is heir to the Egyptian throne, but the two are chummy
teen-age adventurers, drag racing their chariots to edges of
cliffs. Only later, by accident, does Moses find out he is not an
Egyptian. Then (in a stunning episode with animated hieroglyphics)
he learns of his Pharaonic father's decree to murder his fellow
Israelites' first-born.
</P>
<P>
   He begins to see the slaves with new eyes. He becomes a stranger
in his own land. When he smites the Egyptian taskmaster and flees,
he cries out to his brother in late-20th-century fashion, ``All I
have ever known to be true is a lie!'' The idea is that we are
enlightened by discovering who we are. This self-knowledge
determines our allegiances and our views of the truth and
eventually leads us to liberation.
</P>
<P>
   This concept is almost painfully contemporary when appended to
this ancient tale. But it shows where our secular culture has been
leading Moses in recent years. The original biblical text in Exodus
is far more laconic. There is no suggestion that Moses thought he
was anything but a Hebrew. When he is grown, he goes out to see his
``brethren.'' There he sees an ``Egyptian man'' smiting one of
those ``brethren.'' The identification is primal, tribal, not a
matter for discovery or revelation. Instead, the revelation comes
in a more elaborate form.
</P>
<P>
   Moses smites the Egyptian, but he does so only after turning
``this way and that'' to make sure there is no one watching before
he does the deed. In a recent, suggestive survey of the Mosaic
literature, ``Moses: A Life'' (Ballantine), the amateur scholar
Jonathan Kirsch argues that this shows this was not an attack done
out of outrage and passion but had a premeditated element. Moses
planned to kill.
</P>
<P>
   But those precautionary turnings provide a rare glimpse into a
personality that lies behind the spare text and mythic elaborations
that have accumulated over the millenniums. Moses feels outrage at
the Egyptian smiting one of his brethren, but he is also afraid. He
is tempted to act but worries over consequences. Revenge may be
called for; it may even be just. But how free is he, after all, to
take such things into his own hands? What sort of retribution will
there be? He must keep his act secret. So when he does kill the
Egyptian, he hides the body in the sand.
</P>
<P>
   But the blood of the Egyptian does not cry out to the Lord from
the ground like the blood of Abel in Genesis. Moses hides the body
from civil authorities, not from divine justice. He does it
stupidly. Coming upon a dead Egyptian taskmaster covered in sand,
who else will be suspected but Moses' Hebrew brethren? The act is
at once noble and cowardly, calculated and impetuous. It is the act
of a man ruled by strong passions as well as strong fears, an
impulsive man tortured by first and then second thoughts.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, in the second sentence of this three-sentence tale, we
learn that the next day Moses comes upon two Hebrews fighting. When
he tries to intercede, stopping the ``wicked'' one mid-smite,
Moses' stature is challenged by the combatant: ``Who made thee a
ruler and judge over us?'' Moreover, his secret murder of the
previous day is thrust in his face, as a challenge to his virtue.
``And Moses feared.''
</P>
<P>
   In these few sentences, the elements of the developing biblical
drama are laid out: Moses' mercurial personality, his moral
impulse, his sense of guilt, the challenges from his people, the
problems with becoming a judge when his own hands are stained with
blood. The wicked Hebrew's challenging question about who made
Moses ruler eventually will be answered by the burning bush, but
there will be no simplifying the complications.
</P>
<P>
   This is not a matter of Moses finding his identity. It is not
even a matter of liberation. It is a matter of becoming more aware
of the stakes involved in building a human society that, like all
societies, will contain its fair share of passion, murder,
violation, revenge and warfare. These evils flourish on all sides:
Moses himself orders massacres of women and children after a
battle. But the challenge is to build a society that takes all of
those perilously human frailties into account, reconciling freedom
and the authority of law.
</P>
<P>
   We tend to simplify the intricacies here, partly because these
stories have become so bound up in issues of faith. But they
already bear within them ancient traces of conflicting struggles
over the nature of the authority Moses created. If the story's
divine origins are questioned, the floodgates open. Israelite
priests, scholars have told us, added justifications for their
spiritual authority to the Mosaic tales, elevating the stature of
Moses' brother Aaron as the first high priest.
</P>
<P>
   The paraphernalia of pagan magic also abounds, bearing the
traces of more ancient authorities appealed to in the formation of
a people. Most recently, there have been renewed attempts to give
closer attention to the hypothesis Freud championed: that Moses,
who actually bears an Egyptian name, was really an Egyptian prince
who believed in monotheism and tried to build a new nation around
his faith. Even ``The Prince of Egypt'' suggests that the Exodus
story is a struggle between Egyptian brothers.
</P>
<P>
   The biblical text is a monument of human belief, intricately
overlaying archeological strata from different traditions. Now we
have added another trace to the accumulated interpretations. In
secular culture Mosaic authority is not found in the burning bush
or the accumulations of Deuteronomic law, but in ourselves. We
follow the path of the new Moses, as if we could resolve profound
issues simply by discovering our identities and celebrating them as
the path of liberation.

MINNESOTA READIES FOR AN UNCONVENTIONAL LEADING MAN IN THE
GOVERNOR'S OFFICE 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By PAM BELLUCK   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PAUL, Minn. _ The new governor of Minnesota doesn't know
exactly what he'll do in office yet, but he has made a decision
about his daily schedule.
</P>
<P>
   No appointments before 9 o'clock in the morning, he has told his
staff.
</P>
<P>
   Why?
</P>
<P>
   ``Arnold was very worried about me,'' the governor-elect said
the other day. ``Arnold told me I really have to get back to
working out, so that's what I'm going to do every morning.''
</P>
<P>
   Arnold would be Arnold Schwarzenegger, of course. And he was
offering advice to his friend and fellow muscle man, Jesse ``The
Body'' Ventura, the former professional wrestler who happened to
get elected in November to Minnesota's highest office.
</P>
<P>
   As Ventura officially becomes governor on Monday, there is still
a lot up in the air.
</P>
<P>
   How will Ventura, who won 37 percent of the vote under the
banner of the Reform Party, work with a House of Representatives
controlled by Republicans and a Senate controlled by Democrats?
What will Ventura's policies be? And how will a self-styled
outsider who ran under the slogan ``Retaliate in '98'' adjust to
being part of the political establishment?
</P>
<P>
   One thing seems clear: Ventura will be unlike any governor
Minnesota _ or any state, for that matter _ has ever seen.
</P>
<P>
   He has already been the subject of the Doonesbury comic strip
and a guest on the Jay Leno and David Letterman talk shows. He has
signed a six-figure book deal. And he is arranging for the sale of
Jesse Ventura action figures and T-shirts with slogans like ``In
Jesse We Trust.''
</P>
<P>
   Even his elaborate series of inauguration events seems
unprecedented, including a gigantic party later this month for
13,800 people in a basketball arena, for which tickets at $10, $15,
and $20 sold out long ago. (Ventura did, however, forego his
initial promise to arrive at the official inaugural ceremony in a
helicopter and rappel down through the Capitol dome _ his staff
concluded that was just a little too dangerous.)
</P>
<P>
   ``This is strange stuff,'' said Steven Schier, chairman of the
political science department at Carleton College in Northfield.
``Usually a governor comes in and you know where he stands, who his
enemies are and what he's going to do for the next four years.''
</P>
<P>
   Ventura, Schier said, is ``working hard at it and he's smart,
but the problem is he's got zero background.''
</P>
<P>
   Ventura, the strapping, chrome-domed, former bad boy wrestler,
action-film actor and talk radio host, stunned prognosticators by
trouncing two respected and well-known opponents, the democratic
attorney general, Hubert Humphrey III, and the Republican mayor of
St. Paul, Norm Coleman.
</P>
<P>
   Many of his supporters were young people, especially men, and
nearly half had only a high school education. They saw something
refreshing in Ventura, whose previous political experience was as a
part-time suburban mayor and who himself voted in only four of the
last 14 elections.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Ventura has put away his leather jacket and jeans _ and his
occasional camouflage outfit and Australian bush hat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Suits used to take me 40 minutes,'' said Ventura, who has a
gift for shifting quickly between his entertainer and politician
personas. ``Now I can do it in 12.''
</P>
<P>
   He is getting used to a chauffeured sedan instead of his beloved
Porsche. And he has submitted to a phalanx of bodyguards, because,
he says, ``It wouldn't be too good if the governor knocks somebody
down.''
</P>
<P>
   Aware he has a lot to learn, he is trying to get off to a strong
start. He has assembled an advisory committee and immediate staff,
drawing some of the more independent-minded people from all
parties, people generally considered skilled and knowledgeable. He
has spent time touring the state and visiting every state
department. But he has just begun to assemble a cabinet and says
that will take more time.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're like the discoverers of the New World,'' Ventura said in
his transition office in the basement of the Capitol building,
where he has hung a neon sign with the words ``Jesse the Gov'' and
an image of Rodin's ``The Thinker,'' a pose Ventura struck in one
of his campaign commercials. ``There was no one who could sit there
and say `Been there, done that.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Since the election, Ventura, who is generally considered
fiscally conservative and socially progressive on issues like
abortion, has given few concrete hints about his policies, saying
he wants to be prudent and consider a range of ideas.
</P>
<P>
   When asked on the day after the election about the details of
his tax cut proposals, Ventura responded, ``Oh, sheesh.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In a recent speech to farmers, he said he wanted to ``deregulate
some stuff,'' which he later said referred to lifting restrictions,
like those prohibiting farmers from growing industrial hemp.
</P>
<P>
   And during the campaign, he criticized state-subsidized child
care and the state's health insurance program for children. He said
that families should not have children until they could afford them
without government assistance. And he told college students, many
of whom benefit from state tuition aid: ``You don't need the
government. There are plenty of ways to get through college. You're
smart enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Ventura now suggests his actual approach will be less extreme.
His chief of staff, Steven Bosacker, said that Ventura had a habit
of saying things that were intended to provoke debate, rather than
establish a policy stance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think unfortunately people tend to believe that as soon as
you make a comment that's your firm position,'' Bosacker said.
</P>
<P>
   Ventura is finding that even firm campaign pledges require
careful implementation. After promising to give back the state
surplus in increments of $1,000 for every man, woman and child,
Ventura is now evaluating different options for returning a surplus
and wants to wait until the end of the budget period in June to
make sure the state has the money in hand.
</P>
<P>
   It is also not clear how he plans to accomplish one of his major
goals: reducing school class size to 17 without spending more
money.
</P>
<P>
   Still, while he is treading carefully, Ventura has already
managed to push the envelope _ especially in an ethically
strait-laced state like Good Government Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   After refusing contributions from political action committees in
the campaign, he has accepted corporate donations to finance his
transition costs. But he says he does not personally look at the
contributor list.
</P>
<P>
   He has proposed that his wife be paid a salary. And he wants to
put the money from selling T-shirts and action figures into his
campaign fund, but will give it to charity if the state's campaign
ethics board nixes the idea. (He has also asked stores not to sell
the immensely popular, but unlicensed, items that came out shortly
after the election: T-shirts and baseball caps that say ``My
Governor Can Beat Up Your Governor.'')
</P>
<P>
   ``A whole host of things have come out that are extremely
unconventional,'' said Steve Sviggum, the new Republican speaker of
the state House. ``I guess I would just as soon that he focus on
the job that he ran for.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, though, hardly anyone seems to be complaining. A poll in
December by the Minneapolis Star-Tribune found that more people
would vote for Ventura today than did in November. Only 3 percent
answered yes to a somewhat unconventional poll question: whether
they considered Ventura an ``embarrassment.''
</P>
<P>
   And Ventura has another tremendous thing going for him: a state
left in remarkably good shape by the departing governor, Arne
Carlson, with low unemployment and a projected budget surplus of
$3.3 billion over the next two-and-a-half years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't expect it's going to be a session that's going to
produce a lot of new initiatives and as far as budget it's a pat
hand,'' said state Sen. Roger Moe, the Democratic majority leader.
``It's very difficult to screw it up, to be perfectly honest.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps a more difficult challenge for Ventura will be balancing
his stated desire to ``bring honor to this office'' with his rebel
instinct.
</P>
<P>
   So far, he has satisfied his need to tweak conformity by smoking
stogies on the Capitol steps and eating an occasional lunch in
``the regular people's cafeteria.''
</P>
<P>
   But some experts worry that Ventura might get bored or
frustrated.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still have a sense that Jesse may become tired of playing
governor,'' said Chris Gilbert, chairman of the political science
department at Gustavus Adolphus College in St. Peter. ``Not that he
doesn't take it seriously, but I think it is another role for him.
I wonder how he's going to hold up in April when the legislation is
being introduced. I wonder if he's going to really have the stomach
and patience to sit through it.''

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Tranquil weather will return to much of the nation Monday as the
storm that caused record snow in the Middle West and flooding rain
on the Northeast Seaboard carries its assault into eastern Canada.
In the wake of the storm, gusty winds from the west will direct
much drier air to the Eastern Seaboard with ample sunshine and near
seasonable temperatures. Farther west, clouds banked along the
Appalachian mountains will tend to crumble just east of the
mountains as the gusty west winds dry on descent toward the coast.
</P>
<P>
   Narrow bands of intense snow will form to the east of Lake Erie
and Ontario on Monday as frigid air traversing the unfrozen lakes
rises into roiling clouds upon being warmed and moistened. The
snowfall could become quite heavy for a time near Buffalo, N.Y., as
a jet stream disturbance crossing the region enhances the ascending
air currents.
</P>
<P>
   The clockwise circulation around high pressure over Texas will
drive unseasonably cold air into the Deep South on Monday. Clearing
skies and diminishing winds will set the stage for the chilliest
night of the winter season so far as readings drop to near freezing
as far south as Orlando, Fla. Farther west, dry and chilly air will
also cover the southern Plains.
</P>
<P>
   Mild but strong winds from the west will buffet the northeast
Rockies Monday with a few locations recording gusts exceeding 60
mph. Dry and generally sunny conditions will cover the West Coast,
though fog will linger in California's Central Valley. It will be
quite warm in the Los Angeles basin. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   FOCUS: SNOW RECORDS &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Both Rochester, Minn., and Chicago, Ill., broke snowfall records
during this past holiday weekend. On New Year's Day, 1.4 inches
fell in Rochester, breaking the record of 1.0 inch that had stood
since 1956. On Saturday, O'Hare airport measured 18.6 inches of
snow for most snowfall in any 24-hour period in the city's history.
By the time the snow tapered off on Sunday, nearly 22 inches had
fallen at the airport, making this storm the second greatest on
record for Chicago. Surprisingly, Chicago had not measured a foot
of snow in a single storm since 1979, two decades ago.

IN CALCUTTA, PROSTITUTES LEAD THE WAR ON AIDS

<TEXT>
<P>
   CALCUTTA, India _ In the Sonagachi red-light district, where
thousands of women sell their bodies along narrow, thronged lanes,
it is the prostitutes themselves who have become the leading
crusaders against AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   Like missionaries spreading the gospel, scores go forth each
morning from brothel to brothel, preaching to madams, pimps and
other prostitutes about the importance of using condoms, the most
effective shield against HIV infection.
</P>
<P>
   And they have done much more than talk. These women, despised
outcasts in Indian society, have organized more than half the
prostitutes of Sonagachi into a force with the influence to
challenge any pimp or madam who would insist on a customer's right
to sex without a condom. They call themselves a committee, but
operate as a kind of labor union for the world's oldest profession.
</P>
<P>
   Later this year, the Indian government will use the Sonagachi
project as its model in a large-scale battle against AIDS, waged
from red-light district to red-light district, across the vastness
of this country of almost a billion people.
</P>
<P>
   The hope is that if India acts swiftly, while the overall
infection rate is still relatively low, at less than 1 percent of
the total adult population, it can avoid the horrific burden of
death that afflicts Africa. Even now, because of its immense
population, India already has 4 million people estimated to be
infected with the virus.
</P>
<P>
   In a line of work that spawns cut-throat competition among
desperately poor women, and that regularly prompts prostitutes to
risk death by HIV infection for 50 cents per sex act, the Sonagachi
project has knit them together to fight for their rights and their
lives.
</P>
<P>
   Condom use in Sonagachi has soared, from 3 percent in 1992, when
the project began, to 90 percent in 1998. Researchers who have
conducted random sample surveys in Sonagachi have also found that
HIV infection rates among prostitutes here have been held to about
5 percent, a fraction of the more than 50 percent of prostitutes
infected in Bombay.
</P>
<P>
   Slowing the rate of infection among prostitutes and their
customers is essential to protecting the general population,
epidemiologists say. The truck drivers and migrant workers who go
to prostitutes are the same people who are carrying the disease
back to wives and lovers in villages all over the country.
</P>
<P>
   These days, when 30-year-old Pushpa Das, a prostitute in
Sonagachi, is confronted by a man who refuses to diminish his
pleasure by wearing a condom, she tells him to go away and knows
her madam will back her up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes I have to lose a customer, but I don't want to get
HIV,'' Mrs. Das said evenly. ``I just return the money.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Das cannot afford to die. Her husband is out of work. Her
$50 a month earnings keep hunger at bay for her 11-year-old
daughter, Asha, and her extended family. Before she became a
prostitute, she had been making $10 a month as a maid and her
family was down to one meal a day.
</P>
<P>
   The Sonagachi project pays 180 prostitutes about $1 a day each
to spread the word about AIDS and condoms. The British government,
long the colonial power in India, pays for the project and is one
of the largest foreign aid donors supporting health programs here.
This year the Indian government, with about $50 million in
financial backing from the World Bank, will begin using nonprofit
groups and government agencies in a nationwide effort to mobilize
prostitutes against the disease. The project in Sonagachi costs
only about $210,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The experience from other parts of the world and from
Sonagachi suggests that such efforts are the single most important
thing that can be done to try to control the epidemic,'' said
Prabat Jha, an epidemiologist at the World Bank who is team leader
for its AIDS project in India.
</P>
<P>
   One recent morning a group of prostitutes sat on the balcony of
their brothel overlooking a vibrant, clogged lane in Sonagachi. It
was too early for customers, so the women's faces were free of any
makeup. Over the jangling of hand-pulled carriages and the cries of
hawkers selling papayas, they spoke of the poverty that had driven
them into the sex trade.
</P>
<P>
   Milan Sarkar, a 21-year-old in a loose orange shift, was married
at 15 and abandoned by her husband at 16, with an infant son,
Anoop, to raise. There is no government safety net here, so a year
ago she went to Sonagachi. Her income now supports her parents, two
siblings and her 5-year-old son. Ms. Sarkar shields Anoop from the
knowledge of how she makes a living, telling him only that she has
to go to work while he stays with his grandparents.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Sarkar said she refuses to have sex without a condom, but
some drunken men force themselves on her, while others tear the
condoms with their nails so they will peel off during sex.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very frightened about AIDS,'' she said. ``My son and my
whole family depend on me. My father is old and won't be able to
continue working. I have to live here for them. And it is a
terrible pressure.''
</P>
<P>
   The prostitutes who work in the project have used a combination
of sweet talk and occasional arm-twisting to persuade madams about
condom usage. Delegations of prostitutes, wearing distinctive green
medical jackets over their saris, visit madams and tell them, ``If
you are to enjoy the fruits of the tree, you must keep the tree
healthy.''
</P>
<P>
   Gita Das, a 50-year-old madam, manages five prostitutes who
commute to Sonagachi daily to work in two small, dingy rooms. Mrs.
Das, who wears a bindi, the red dot on a woman's forehead that
signifies her status as a married woman, inherited the role of
madam from her mother-in-law 25 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   She has become a convert to condoms out of her own
self-interest. ``I argue with the customers, `You should use
condoms,''' she said. ``If they refuse I send them away. If the
girls use condoms and stay healthy, that helps keep them loyal to
me.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Not every expert is sure the Sonagachi approach will work
outside the state of West Bengal. Calcutta, its capital, has
India's strongest tradition of labor unionism, an inspiration for
the Sonagachi project. In contrast, Bombay, the epicenter of the
epidemic, has a brutal and powerful mafia that runs the sex trade.
Gangsters are likely to resist efforts to organize prostitutes.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, even the skeptics agree that India must act. ``If
you don't try to take these efforts to scale, you'll have little
wonderful corners, but you won't address the big issues that India
poses by its sheer size,'' said Gordon Alexander, who heads the
U.N. AIDS program in India.
</P>
<P>
   This nation is only now awakening to the dangers the epidemic
poses. Last month, for the first time, an Indian prime minister
spoke publicly and at length about the disease. Prime Minister Atal
Behari Vajpayee declared HIV and AIDS to be the country's most
serious public health challenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``When HIV appeared in India in 1986, everybody thought that it
is a Western disease that will be contracted only by sex workers in
red-light areas, gay men and injecting drug users,'' Vajpayee said.
``The consequences of that myopic view are now upon us.''
</P>
<P>
   The first prostitutes who ventured into Sonagachi and other
red-light districts in Calcutta to talk about the prevention of
AIDS were chased off with brooms, drenched with buckets of water
and spat on. Prostitutes and madams feared that an insistence on
condoms would drive customers away.
</P>
<P>
   Sadhana Mukherjee, 40, remembers hoodlums threatening to strip
her naked, beat her up and throw her out of the red-light district
unless she stopped proselytizing for condoms. But she and her
supervisor politely explained their strategy: If the district
became known for AIDS, that would really drive customers away. They
were not trying to destroy the sex trade, only to insure the health
of prostitutes.
</P>
<P>
   Like many of the other prostitutes working in the project, Ms.
Mukherjee keenly felt the sting of society's contempt, but she was
proud that she had survived by her wits.
</P>
<P>
   When she was 12 her family was duped into giving her up to a
woman who promised to find her work in a plastics factory in
Calcutta. Instead, Ms. Mukherjee said, the woman sold her to a
brothel for $10.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was beaten on the cheeks, tugged by my hair, forced to drink
alcohol, strangled so I couldn't swallow for two weeks,'' she said.
``The rage I felt about being tortured so mercilessly has burned
within me from the first day.''
</P>
<P>
   It is those memories of her first terrible years in the sex
trade that have made her a passionate and untiring worker for the
rights of prostitutes in Sonagachi.
</P>
<P>
   And the respect with which she and the other prostitutes have
been treated in the project has strengthened their bond. They all
speak with affection of Smarajit Jana, the slight, mustachioed
epidemiologist who was assigned to run the Sonagachi project by the
nation's All India Institute of Hygiene and Public Health, part of
the Indian government's ministry of health.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's like a father and a mother to us,'' said Minu Adhikari,
one of the first prostitutes hired by the project. ``We were
stigmatized by everyone around us. He showered us with love and
affection.''
</P>
<P>
   Jana said he quickly realized that reaching the prostitutes
would require much more than a narrow focus on AIDS. In his first
week on the job, the courteous but rather formal researcher visited
a brothel. He was introduced, he said, as ``the big doctor from the
big hospital,'' and found the prostitutes reluctant to talk.
</P>
<P>
   But by the third day, they began asking him for medical advice.
To his astonishment, the first nine women wanted help with
infertility problems, common among prostitutes who have had
repeated bouts of sexually transmitted diseases.
</P>
<P>
   ``That opened my eyes,'' he said. ``They're like any other
women. They want a child. They have the same heart, the same minds
and feelings.''
</P>
<P>
   The health clinic that opened in Sonagachi to treat syphilis and
gonorrhea wound up treating women and children. It was the first
time most prostitutes had an alternative to quack doctors who
practice in the red-light district.
</P>
<P>
   Just a year and a half after the project began, the percentage
of prostitutes who said they used condoms had risen from almost
nothing to 70 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Something less tangible had also begun to happen. The
prostitutes hired by the project were turning into a force to be
reckoned with in the power structure of the red-light district _ a
place where madams, pimps, hoodlums, money lenders and quacks once
reigned supreme.
</P>
<P>
   The literate prostitutes in the project began teaching the
others to read in makeshift daily classes held on plastic sheeting
spread on the bare ground in the clinic's courtyard _ classes that
continue even now.
</P>
<P>
   By 1994 they began demanding things that went way beyond the
project's mandate. They wanted police protection from hoodlums.
They wanted police raids to stop. They wanted a place to borrow
money at fair rates.
</P>
<P>
   Jana said he also realized that the prostitutes needed more than
information and condoms to prevent the spread of HIV.
</P>
<P>
   ``They must enforce condom use by the clients, for which they
need skill, confidence and power,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   With his encouragement, the prostitutes organized the Women's
Collaborative Committee in 1995. The committee now has about 30,000
members in West Bengal, each paying dues of about 50 cents a year.
</P>
<P>
   They have since formed their own financial cooperative to escape
the clutches of money lenders who charge interest rates of at least
1,000 percent a year. To do so, committee members persuaded the
state government to dissolve a requirement that members of a
cooperative have legal standing as people of ``good moral
character.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of prostitutes have repeatedly encircled police
stations to demand action against criminals. In one case, men who
had tortured two prostitutes with blades and cigarette butts had
gone unpunished. After the prostitutes held their noisy protest,
police arrested the men and beat them up, the gratified prostitutes
said.
</P>
<P>
   The women have also intervened to rescue child prostitutes sold
or duped into the trade. The committee members' motives are
altruistic yet self-interested. The under-age girls are tough
competition in a market that prizes youth, and they also attract
police raids that disrupt business.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, on a routine visit to a brothel, Ms. Adhikari, one of
the prostitutes working in the project, said she discovered a
13-year-old girl from Bangladesh who had been sold to a madam. Ms.
Adhikari said she simply walked out with the girl and the committee
later returned her to her family.
</P>
<P>
   ``The committee explains to the madam that this is not done,''
Ms. Adhikari said. ``She doesn't have the muscle to fight us. We're
too big for her. She can't go to the police. And now that we're so
organized, she can't go to the hoodlums either.''
</P>
<P>
   The percentage of prostitutes 19 or younger in Sonagachi dropped
from about one in five in 1995 to about one in 30 in 1998,
according to project surveys.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years the project has expanded beyond the confines of
Sonagachi, home to about 6,000 prostitutes, into other red-light
districts in Calcutta and nearby areas, where about 21,000
prostitutes work. It employs 180 prostitutes and 100 other workers
and operates 12 health clinics.
</P>
<P>
   The government's All India Institute of Hygiene and Public
Health runs the project in collaboration with three nonprofit
groups and the prostitutes' committee.
</P>
<P>
   They have managed to do the work at low cost. The main office is
a windowless basement. The project has cut back on distribution of
free condoms and sells many of them through the cooperative at bulk
rates. The staff is paid very little by Western standards.
Medicines in India are inexpensive.
</P>
<P>
   Bharati Dey, a 38-year-old prostitute, joined the project in
1997 to work in Talpukur, a red-light district in a northern
suburb. She recently visited a defiant madam who refused to require
customers visiting her brothel to wear a condom.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Dey said she took the nine prostitutes in the brothel aside
and suggested they disappear for a few days. ``Less than an hour
after they left, the madam gave in,'' Ms. Dey said. ``But they did
not return for three days.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a message of strength that quickly spread to other
madams.
</P>
<P>
   Jana and the prostitutes who work in the Sonagachi project will
soon become missionaries far beyond the confines of Calcutta. Jana,
45, will leave his post in Sonagachi and plans to advise the Indian
government in its efforts to expand the model nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   J.V.R. Prasada Rao, director of India's National AIDS Control
Organization, said he would tap the expertise of the prostitutes,
as well as that of Jana. ``We're going to take the Sonagachi girls
to Bombay and ask them to talk to the madams and sex workers,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Bombay is ground zero for AIDS in India. Almost half the people
infected with the HIV virus live in the state of Maharastra and its
capital, Bombay. And rates of HIV infection among prostitutes in
its sprawling sex industry are already very high.
</P>
<P>
   The prostitutes in Bombay are powerless, not only against the
disease, but against the gangsters who run the trade. There are
several small programs there that employ prostitutes to spread the
word about condoms and that provide prostitutes with health care,
but none of them have attempted to organize the women.
</P>
<P>
   The difference in the moods of the red-light districts of
Calcutta and Bombay can be sensed immediately. In Calcutta, many
prostitutes talk openly in front of their madams. In Bombay, they
speak quietly, glancing furtively over their shoulders to make sure
no one hears.
</P>
<P>
   In Calcutta, many of the prostitutes wear decorous saris in
muted colors and look a lot like office workers waiting impassively
at a bus stop.
</P>
<P>
   In Bombay, they are tarted up in shiny red lip gloss,
midriff-bearing halters, skin-tight velvet pants and gaudy saris.
They pose aggressively and their faces are set in a sulky come-on.
They stand in the lurid light of Falkland Road like Broadway
actresses on a gritty stage. Unprotected from HIV, they are
tempting death to come knocking.

<TEXT>
<P>
   SIHANOUKVILLE, Cambodia _ When 3,000 tons of industrial material
from Taiwan was dumped in a field here a month ago, the poor
villagers living nearby were thrilled at the windfall.
</P>
<P>
   They emptied out chunks of the cement-like material from the
white plastic sacks to use for tents and canopies and bedding. They
ripped open the bags with their teeth to get string to use as
clotheslines and as fasteners for oxcarts. They rinsed out the bags
and used them to store rice.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought we were in luck!'' said Em Sim, 35, laughing at her
folly. ``Yes, we thought this was our lucky day. For me the bags
were just what I needed to make a sleeping mat.''
</P>
<P>
   The mat smelled a little like cement when she slept on it, she
said. Then she started to have headaches. She began to feel thirsty
and tired. She had difficulty breathing. She lost her appetite,
suffered from diarrhea and began to lose weight.
</P>
<P>
   Her 5-year-old son, Chhien, who played in the dusty waste
material while his mother gathered the sacks, has developed a rash
and a fever and also has been losing weight, Mrs. Sim said.
</P>
<P>
   One after another, members of 40 families who evacuated the
village of Bet Trang told similar stories of mysterious ailments
that began after dozens of trucks arrived in the night and unloaded
the material nearby.
</P>
<P>
   In the weeks since then, the dump has aroused international
concern and caused a local panic. A dock worker who cleaned out the
hold of a ship transporting the material died and five others were
hospitalized.
</P>
<P>
   Learning of this, residents of Sihanoukville fled the city, then
most of them returned. A riot broke out in the city center,
damaging several buildings and leading to a dozen arrests,
including two human rights workers who were advising the
demonstrators on how to conduct a legal protest.
</P>
<P>
   A variety of tests determined that the waste material _
compressed ash from an industrial waste incinerator _ was
contaminated with high levels of mercury as well as a possibly
hazardous mix of other metals. But debate continued over the degree
of danger it posed.
</P>
<P>
   The company that had sent the waste, Formosa Plastics Corp.,
said it had not been able to dump it in Taiwan because of a threat
of public protests. The Cambodian government threatened to sue and
Taiwan agreed to take the waste back. Workers have begun sealing it
in barrels.
</P>
<P>
   The villagers said they first learned that they had been
handling toxic material when local journalists arrived two weeks
after it was dumped to take pictures of them.
</P>
<P>
   Just before Christmas, they said, the military sealed off the
village and ordered them to leave. Apart from that, the villagers
said, the government has ignored them. They have not been tested
for poisoning, nor treated for their ailments. They have not been
given alternative shelter. They are living as squatters and
surviving on donations from the World Food Program.
</P>
<P>
   The people of Bet Trang spoke without anger.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't usually see people getting angry about things around
here because they have taken so much in their lives from people who
have more influence than they do,'' said Michele R. Brandt, an
American lawyer who works with Legal Aid of Cambodia, a local human
rights group.
</P>
<P>
   It remained unclear, one month after the dumping, just how toxic
the material is and what had caused the villagers' symptoms. Ms.
Brandt, whose organization is representing the affected villagers,
said government officials, inexperienced in handling such
emergencies, did not advise the villagers to move away when the
possibility of poisoning was first raised.
</P>
<P>
   Georg Peterson, the Cambodian representative for the World
Health Organization, told Reuters that although tests had shown
``extremely high'' concentrations of inorganic mercury, the
material posed little immediate threat to health.
</P>
<P>
   He said that blood and urine tests on port workers and soldiers
who have handled the material were normal and that ``none seems to
have symptoms of poisoning.'' But the evacuees interviewed here
said they had not been tested, and Ms. Brandt said their exposure
seemed to have been more direct and prolonged than that of the port
workers and soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   Hun Vuthy, 15, was among a group of youngsters who had romped in
the dumpsite. ``We picked it up and played in it,'' he said. ``It
was interesting stuff and I was curious.'' He is now suffering from
fever, diarrhea and weight loss.
</P>
<P>
   Lan Chan Heng, 30, ripped some of the bags apart with his teeth
to get the string that was used to fasten them. He said he now
suffers from a white discharge from his eyes and from pain in his
eyes and bones and joints that keeps him awake at night.
</P>
<P>
   Khuan Kong, 36, who has four small children, gave birth to a
fifth child 15 days ago, before the villagers were evacuated. She
also had collected bags from the dump and is worried about the
effects on her children.
</P>
<P>
   The worst problem, Mrs. Sim said, is that the people of Bet
Trang now have no homes and no work. She said she was eager to
return home.
</P>

MEXICO'S POOR FEEL PINCHED AS TORTILLA PRICES RISE 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 BY GINGER THOMPSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ With most of her New Year's Eve dinner keeping
warm in the oven, Sylvia Cortez, a mother of five, stepped out last
Thursday to make one last-minute purchase. But that trip to the
store turned her festive mood sour.
</P>
<P>
   A sign on the wall announced that with the new year, the price
of tortillas, which she said is the most important element of her
family's daily diet, would go up from 15 cents a pound to about 20
cents. Her voice full of anger, she asked the attendant for her
usual daily order, two kilograms, or about 4 and a-half pounds, of
the corn cakes, hot off a rotating grill and wrapped in a bright
pink sheet of paper.
</P>
<P>
   And as she walked away, Mrs. Cortez said she began calculating
how she would stretch her husband's pay of about $3.50 a day to
cover the increase.
</P>
<P>
   In a move that has caused concern among millions of families
like Mrs. Cortez's, the Mexican government has ended decades-old
corn subsidies and price controls on tortillas, a staple that is as
central to the Mexican diet _ particularly among the poor _ as
bread is to Americans and rice is to the Chinese.
</P>
<P>
   The measure, officials said, is part of an effort by President
Ernesto Zedillo to reduce government spending. Last year, they
said, tortilla subsidies cost the government $1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Plummeting prices for oil, whose sale accounts for a third of
government revenues, have caused a dramatic decline in federal
revenues and have forced Zedillo to make deep cuts in numerous
programs.
</P>
<P>
   But liberating the tortilla from price controls, said Mrs.
Cortez, the wife of a construction worker, is like pouring salt in
an open wound for working-class families. Over the last few months,
the prices of many basic foods _ including beans, milk and rice _
have gone up by 10 percent. And over the last year, the price of
tortillas has risen more than 55 percent as the government prepared
to eliminate subsidies.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Mrs. Cortez said, her husband's salary _ the
minimum wage in Mexico City _ has stayed the same.
</P>
<P>
   ``Already my children eat meat only once a week,'' she said.
``Maybe now I'll have to buy less fruit and vegetables. But I
cannot buy fewer tortillas. Tortillas are what fill us.''
</P>
<P>
   The government contends that price controls on tortillas
depressed the industry by keeping revenues low for tortilla makers
while their operating costs rose. They say that eliminating the
subsidies will allow the 50,000 small- and medium-sized tortilla
makers across the country to expand and modernize. The government
also says that ending the subsidies will help preserve jobs for
160,000 tortilla workers.
</P>
<P>
   And, although details have yet to be announced, the government
also has promised to create a program to compensate for the end of
price controls by providing free or cheap tortillas to the poor.
</P>
<P>
   Sergio Celorio, whose tortilla factory on the north side of the
city produces 12 tons of tortillas a day, supports the elimination
of price controls.
</P>
<P>
   ``Subsidies aimed at consumers of tortillas have only created a
community of beggars,'' said Celorio, who is president of an
association of more than 17,000 tortilla makers. ``What we need to
do is stimulate the industry. Those who produce more, get paid
more. That way, we would create communities of workers.''
</P>
<P>
   Tortillas are so entrenched in Mexican culture that the recipe
for the soft, bland corn cakes _ corn and hot water _ has hardly
changed since it was created by the Aztecs. The average Mexican
consumes nearly 300 pounds of tortillas a year, officials said. And
for the poor, tortillas provide half their daily intake of
calories.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Recently the government has examined ideas for producing healthy
tortillas, enriched with vitamins and minerals, to help fight
widespread malnutrition and anemia among Mexico's poor. More than
half of Mexico's people live in poverty.
</P>
<P>
   Tortilla price controls and corn subsidies began in the early
1970s during the populist presidency of Luis Echeverria as a way to
protect the poor from starvation. And, until now, the tortilla
subsidy was so politically sensitive that many politicians dared
not destroy it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The poor are always forced to carry the economic burdens of
this country,'' said poet and social activist Homero Aridjis.
``Eliminating tortilla subsidies will break their backs.''
</P>
<P>
   Similar frustration was echoed by people who came to buy
tortillas at the small tortilleria where Mrs. Cortez shops in the
working class neighborhood of Ixtapalapa.
</P>
<P>
   The air inside the shop smelled bitter from lime, the chemical
preservative that is added to the tortilla dough. The owner,
Gabriel Peralta, spoke over the clatter of the tortilla machine,
which pressed the dough flat, punched out round circles and then
moved them on a conveyor belt through an oven.
</P>
<P>
   Customers trickled up to the counter, buying the tortillas in
stacks sold by the kilogram.
</P>
<P>
   Peralta, 59, said he took over the small, one-room shop from his
father. His 23-year-old son Edgar was standing with him at the
counter, learning the trade.
</P>
<P>
   Both of them frowned when asked about the rising tortillas
prices. They said that about 500 people buy tortillas at their
store each day. Most of them are low-income people, barely able to
make ends meet.
</P>
<P>
   ``For most of the people around here, tortillas are the main
food of the day,'' the elder Peralta said. Then he took a deep
breath and tugged on his belt. ``Pretty soon, we are going to have
to hold in our stomachs because there will be nothing to fill
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Emma Guzman, a 35-year-old mother of two, interrupted before
walking away with four pounds of tortillas. ``How are we supposed
to feed our children?'' she grumbled.
</P>
<P>
   Norma Dominguez Sanchez, 22, made a much larger purchase. She
works with her aunt in a small restaurant down the street and
usually buys 14 to 20 pounds of tortillas each day to sell tacos
and quesadillas for pennies each to workers in the area. But if the
price of tortillas keeps rising, she said, she and her aunt may
change their menu.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rolls are cheaper, so maybe we will begin to sell
sandwiches,'' she said. ``I don't know if people will like it, but
we may have to do it.''

COMPANIES WITHOUT Y2K PLANS SHOULD BRACE FOR LAWSUITS FROM
EMPLOYEES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE STAFFORD  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED: Tick tock. It's 1999. One more year until 2000, at
which time we'll have read or heard about the Year 2000 computer
problem ad nauseum. Don't get bored yet, though _ especially if
you're a director, owner or executive at a non-Y2K-compliant
workplace.
</P>
<P>
   Experts are warning to expect lawsuits from employees who don't
get their paychecks or other benefits on time.
</P>
<P>
   The scurry to fix old computer programs that use only two digits
for a date _ and thus treat the year 2000 as 1900 _ is bringing out
the antacid in board meetings. Board members, as well as those in
ownership or top management positions, should heed this notice
published in ``Director's Monthly,'' a newsletter of the National
Association of Corporate Directors:
</P>
<P>
   ``To the extent a company's board of directors fails to adopt a
Year 2000 corrective action plan or acts in a manner which results
in losses to the corporation as the result of the Y2K problem, the
potential for lawsuits from its employees and its shareholder is
high.''
</P>
<P>
   The potential for risk _ corporate and personal _ obviously
depends partly on the size of your company, how much of your
business activity relies on computer programs affected by the Y2K
problem and what good-faith effort your organization is making now
to prevent trouble.
</P>
<P>
   You also should find out what similar efforts your service
providers and record keepers are undertaking. Just imagine if your
pension or COBRA administrator is not Y2K compliant.
</P>
<P>
   And don't count on an insurance bail-out. Insurance companies
are writing policy disclaimers saying they won't bail out
organizations that failed to exercise expected diligence in fixing
Y2K problems.
</P>
<P>
   Y2K litigation from employees may come hand in hand with
lawsuits from shareholders and customers. You're wise to do what
you can now to protect yourself from being named as a defendant.

ONCE AGAIN, A FEARLESS FORECAST FOR THE NEW YEAR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY HEASTER  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED: Hey, kids, what time is it? Why, it's Fearless Forecast
time!
</P>
<P>
   That's right! Ready or not, your Uncle Fearless is about to do
his annual high-wire prognostication performance without a net. The
result is usually a pratfall of disastrous proportions, but what
the heck. The only thing Uncle Fearless ever hurts in these bouts
of soothsaying exhibitionism is his pride.
</P>
<P>
   If these exercises in augury are so seldom near the target, you
may ask, then what is the point of the indulgence?
</P>
<P>
   Good question.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of it is the company it allows your Fearless Forecaster to
keep. Some of the most eminent economists on the planet are
humiliated by their prognosticatory urges. The prospect of being
wrong with the best of them is an irresistible temptation. Another
good reason, of course, is that this space cannot be left blank,
and this is a slow time of year.
</P>
<P>
   There is also the matter of demand for the product. There are no
doubt many readers who enjoy seeing Uncle Fearless look foolish. An
editor put it all into perfect perspective a couple of years ago by
topping the Fearless Forecast column with a ``Bozo's back, and...''
headline. Is that recognition, or what?
</P>
<P>
   OK, kids, enough of this serious stuff. Let's get onto the fun
part and start forecasting:
</P>
<P>
   - Economic growth: After two years of a much stronger economy
than many experts anticipated, growth really will begin to slow in
1999. The pace of worldwide expansion slowed from 3.3 percent in
1997 to 1.7 percent in 1998, and this must translate into reduced
U.S. output. After expanding 3.5 percent in each of the last two
years, gross domestic product will grow 2 percent or slightly less
in 1999. The Federal Reserve will do all in its power to keep the
economy moving, and full employment will keep consumers in the ball
game. Something else to think about is that if the expansion keeps
going into early 2000, it will become the longest in U.S. history.
</P>
<P>
   - Stock market: Low interest rates and Internet-stocks madness
can only fuel the market's unlikely strength for so long before
earnings reality sets in. Unless corporate profits stage an
unexpected rally in 1999, the overall market is likely to back and
fill, with not much potential on the upside. The Dow Jones
industrial average will record a bottom of 7,500 and a top of 9,800
and close the year at 8,600 for its first down year since 1990.
</P>
<P>
   - Interest rates: Accommodative Fed policy, low inflation and
slower growth at home and abroad will combine to keep interest
rates tamped. The 30-year Treasury bond will close the year
yielding 4.25 percent, and the three-month bill rate will end 1999
at 3.65 percent.
</P>
<P>
   - Inflation: The deflation in commodities and competition in the
global marketplace will serve to keep the general price level down.
The Consumer Price Index rise will be below 2 percent for the third
straight year.
</P>
<P>
   That's all, folks! Stop by same time next year, and watch your
Uncle Fearless eat another heapin' helpin' of prognosticatory crow.

MISSOURI LAWMAKERS AGAIN HOPE TO TIGHTEN UP LAW ON FORFEITURES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KAREN DILLON  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Some Missouri lawmakers are about to take
another crack at making police send money they seize in drug crimes
to schools.
</P>
<P>
   So far, they've had little success.
</P>
<P>
   In 1990 the Missouri Supreme Court affirmed a constitutional
mandate requiring police to give up the money. The case involved
the Odessa School District and more than $1 million seized by the
Lafayette County sheriff's office.
</P>
<P>
   Just one week later, the U.S. attorney for the Western District
of Missouri wrote a letter offering to help local law enforcement
officials keep drug money. Jean Paul Bradshaw II encouraged them to
file their forfeitures with the U.S. Department of Justice, rather
than with the state.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993 the state legislature passed new laws to block such
handoffs, but they continue.
</P>
<P>
   The legislature's next attempt will come in the new session with
a bill that would allow law enforcement to keep 50 percent of the
drug money if the other half is given to schools.
</P>
<P>
   Under one proposal, police departments would not be able to keep
their 50 percent. Instead, the money would be deposited in a state
fund and distributed as grants to all police agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Missouri voters also would have to approve the measure, because
it would amend the state constitution.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the bill has been around several years, passage may
be more likely this year.
</P>
<P>
   Educators have been leery in the past, said Missouri Rep. Craig
Hosmer, a Springfield Democrat who sponsored the bill to split the
money. But educators finally appear to be accepting the compromise
because they realize how little the schools receive in forfeiture
money, Hosmer said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fifty percent is better than nothing,'' Hosmer said.
</P>
<P>
   However, if law enforcement can get 80 percent of the money by
sending it through a federal agency, would they settle for 50
percent instead?
</P>
<P>
   No, said Capt. Tom Neer of the St. Charles County Sheriff's
Department.
</P>
<P>
   ``We work with the DEA and FBI,'' Neer said. ``So any of those
forfeitures or seizures that they get, we share in 80 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   Some legislators support the 50-50 bill because they think
police should have some share of drug money. In fact, many of them
say they didn't know police already had been keeping money that
should have gone to education.
</P>
<P>
   Two backers of the 1993 laws, Sen. Wayne Goode, a St. Louis
Democrat, and Sen. Francis Flotron, a Chesterfield Republican, said
they would consider other reform bills this session.
</P>
<P>
   The two senators said it might be necessary to prohibit any drug
money from being transferred to federal agencies under any
circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   Another law that was passed last year will help clear up the
mystery of how much _ or how little _ money police actually send to
the schools.
</P>
<P>
   Until the law went into effect in August, there was no central
clearinghouse to tally the money. Instead, the financial records
were kept by each of Missouri's 114 counties and the city of St.
Louis.
</P>
<P>
   The law, which was sponsored by Rep. Jim Kreider, a Nixa
Democrat, requires the Missouri Department of Revenue to collect
the money and place it in a school building fund.
</P>
<P>
   Although that will provide a central tally of money collected
for schools, the public still won't know how much money law
enforcement diverts away from education.
</P>
<P>
   The constitutionality of the law was challenged in a lawsuit
filed last month by Lafayette County Prosecutor Page Bellamy.
</P>
<P>
   Bellamy is one of the few Missouri prosecutors who has publicly
pushed his county to file forfeitures with the state _ and that's
one reason for his challenge.
</P>
<P>
   Under the new law, counties like Lafayette that turn over drug
money for education would be treated the same as counties that
don't.
</P>
<P>
   In another pending lawsuit, Kansas City police asked the courts
in 1997 to clarify what the department must do with seized and
unclaimed money of all types that it had been keeping and not
sending to either the state or federal agencies.
</P>
<P>
   The existence of the fund, worth more than $1 million, was
disclosed in 1996 by The Kansas City Star. Defendants in the
lawsuit are 11 school districts that normally would receive most of
the money.

<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Although law enforcement agencies refused to
provide records that would show how much money they were diverting
from Missouri schools, The Kansas City Star found 14 such cases in
western Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   Some of those cases were described in court documents, sometimes
generated when a defendant tried to regain money police had seized
and turned over to federal agencies. Most of the other cases came
from police reports about people whose names appeared on a Kansas
City police list of 120 money seizures.
</P>
<P>
   A sampling of the cases:
</P>
<P>
   - In January 1997, two Minnesota men were driving on Interstate
35 in North Kansas City when a Missouri Highway Patrol trooper
pulled them over for speeding.
</P>
<P>
   When the men refused to let the trooper search their car, he
called for a drug-sniffing dog, first from North Kansas City, which
did not have a dog, and then from Kansas City police, whose dog was
unavailable. The Clay County Sheriff's Department provided a dog,
which indicated the possible presence of drugs toward the rear of
the car.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, at least an hour after the stop, officers opened the
trunk and found $473,790. When both men said the money did not
belong to them, a federal Drug Enforcement Administration agent was
called, according to a Highway Patrol report.
</P>
<P>
   The DEA took the money, later returning more than $274,000 to
the Highway Patrol and more than $94,000 to Clay County. North
Kansas City raised donations to buy a drug dog so it wouldn't be
unprepared the next time such a windfall occurred.
</P>
<P>
   - Jason Higgs' pregnant girlfriend left the house after a fight
in 1994 and called Kansas City police. She told them Higgs kept
drugs and a gun in the house.
</P>
<P>
   Police obtained a search warrant for the house, where they saw
several guns, cash, ``expensive-looking furniture,'' electronic
equipment and a cornucopia of other items, including cocaine.
Police obtained a second search warrant to recover all of it.
</P>
<P>
   Then they called the DEA.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given the totality of the above circumstances I contacted the
DEA to see if they would be interested in seizing the items inside
the house,'' Detective Steve Christensen wrote in a report.
</P>
<P>
   A DEA agent took the $3,925 in cash, a BMW and all the
electronic equipment, according to police records. Later the DEA
returned more than $10,000 to police.
</P>
<P>
   Higgs pleaded guilty to drug charges in federal court.
</P>
<P>
   - Kansas City police arrested David Humphrey in 1992 and seized
guns, drugs and $21,576 in cash. The drug charges were dropped, and
Humphrey was convicted on a weapons violation.
</P>
<P>
   Police held onto the money in a hidden account.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after Humphrey was released from prison in 1996, he was
charged in the wounding of two Kansas City police officers and
sentenced to 40 years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Police asked the DEA to adopt Humphrey's $21,576 from the
seizure four years before, according to federal court records.
Humphrey fought the move in federal court, but a judge approved a
settlement that gave $16,182 to the DEA, which returned $12,763 of
it to police. Humphrey kept the rest.
</P>
<P>
   - A Lafayette County sheriff's deputy stopped Bruce A. Wilson in
1993 on suspicion of drunken driving. The deputy spotted white
powder in a vial in Wilson's shoe and arrested him.
</P>
<P>
   The car was towed to the Odessa Police Department, where a
police officer found $13,328. Two months later a cashier's check
was sent to the DEA. The DEA didn't complete the process to keep
the money, however, until three years later, in 1996, according to
court records. The records do not tell how much the DEA returned to
police.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson was convicted the same year in federal court of drug
trafficking.
</P>
<P>
   - In 1996, Kansas City police searched the home of a restaurant
owner after a confidential informant reported that the owner was
selling marijuana, according to court and police records. Police
seized a couple of plastic bags containing marijuana, $23,000 in
cash and three cars.
</P>
<P>
   A few months later, police arrested the owner at his restaurant
and charged him with two counts of distributing a controlled
substance. During the arrest at the restaurant, a friend was
searched and police found more than $3,000 on him, according to
police records and an attorney in the case. That money also was
seized.
</P>
<P>
   Police sent all the money to the DEA, which returned $21,000.
</P>
<P>
   The state appellate court recently overturned the restaurant
owner's conviction, ruling that the search of his home was illegal.
</P>
<P>
   But the cash and cars have not been returned to him.

SCHOOL CAN LOSE, EVEN IF LAW IS FOLLOWED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KAREN DILLON  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Missouri law requires police departments to
send drug money they seize through state courts _ and sometimes
police do it.
</P>
<P>
   But even when they do, police have used the court system to get
the money back.
</P>
<P>
   Although that may not be a clear violation of state law, it
violates the intent of sending drug money to state schools, legal
experts say.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are, in fact, circumventing something that is as
important if not more important than the war on drugs, and that is
the education of our youth,'' said Larry Schaffer, a defense
attorney who also has worked as a prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
   The law requires police to report seized money to the county
prosecutor, who may choose to file a petition to forfeit the money.
The law then allows a judge to transfer forfeitures to a federal
agency, rather than the schools _ if it appears the case would be
better pursued under federal law.
</P>
<P>
   In seven cases The Kansas City Star found in Jackson and Pettis
counties, police turned a total of $263,000 in drug money over to
county prosecutors. In each case, the prosecutor asked a judge to
send the money to a federal agency, which then sent most of it back
to police.
</P>
<P>
   None of the documents in the six Jackson County cases outlined
why a federal agency would be better able to handle the case.
</P>
<P>
   Dana Ford's case is typical.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Kansas City police, through a confidential informant,
made three drug buys, which led detectives to a house in the 3300
block of Norton Avenue. Police searched the house, seizing more
than $11,000 worth of cash and other property.
</P>
<P>
   Ford was charged by the Jackson County prosecutor's office and
convicted in Circuit Court of trafficking in drugs.
</P>
<P>
   But the money took a separate route.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-four days after police searched the house, Kansas City
Detective Steve Christensen contacted assistant prosecutor Melissa
Rodriguez.
</P>
<P>
   Christensen told her that the federal Drug Enforcement
Administration had opened an investigation of Ford and that police
wanted to transfer the forfeiture to the DEA, according to court
records. (The request did not comply with state law, which requires
police to report a seizure to prosecutors within four days.)
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez filed the request with the state court.
</P>
<P>
   Schaffer, Ford's attorney, pointed out in a brief that the
prosecutor had failed to provide any evidence that the case would
be better prosecuted under federal law. There also was no evidence
of a DEA investigation, he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   To allow the transfer ``simply because the Kansas City,
Missouri, Police Department...may receive a `kick-back' from the
Federal Government,'' the brief said, ``circumvents the Missouri
Constitution.''
</P>
<P>
   But Judge Ronald R. Holliger of the Jackson County Circuit Court
signed an order to transfer most of the forfeiture to the DEA after
Ford and the prosecutor had reached a settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas City police received $7,449. The DEA kept $4,000.
</P>
<P>
   Holliger said it was difficult for him to remember the case, but
after rereading Rodriguez's motion, he thinks he had considered the
statement that the DEA was investigating Ford. He said he did not
know that Ford was being tried in state court, not federal court.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez, who now works for the Jackson County counselor's
office, said she would not comment on the case. Christensen did not
return phone calls.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutor Claire McCaskill said the transfer shouldn't have
happened.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I had been the judge, I would have ruled against my office
on that transfer,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She added, though, that she didn't have time to monitor each of
the hundreds of cases that come through her office each year.
</P>
<P>
   McCaskill did get involved in one strange case.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995 a Kansas City police officer spotted Daniel Gonzales
burying $87,300 in the woods along Cliff Drive. After fighting with
police, Gonzales was charged with misdemeanor assault.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, in a newspaper article about the incident, police
said they had given the money to the FBI because they thought it
was linked to drugs.
</P>
<P>
   When McCaskill saw the story, she immediately called police to
tell them they could not just give the money to the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   ``I asked them, `What in the world are the feds doing with that
money?' '' McCaskill recalled.
</P>
<P>
   So police simply sent the case through McCaskill's office, which
asked a judge to transfer the money to the FBI. Again, the judge
did.
</P>
<P>
   McCaskill said she did not supervise the case, but she
speculated that it might have involved interstate trafficking of
drugs.
</P>
<P>
   A year later, Kansas City police got $52,272 back from the FBI,
which kept $35,028.

FEDERAL AGENCIES, POLICE KEEP PUBLIC RECORDS OUT OF REACH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ How can you find out how much drug money law
enforcement is keeping instead of sending to Missouri schools?
</P>
<P>
   By looking at public records called DAG-71 reports. There's only
one problem: You can't.
</P>
<P>
   Law enforcement has constructed a neat Catch-22 to keep DAG-71s
closed. It works this way:
</P>
<P>
   The Kansas City Police Department, the Missouri Highway Patrol
and the Platte County Sheriff's Department all refuse to release
the reports. They say the reports, which they must fill out to ask
the Drug Enforcement Administration to handle the drug money,
belong to the federal agency.
</P>
<P>
   So contact the DEA, they say.
</P>
<P>
   But no, DEA officials say. They can't legally release the
reports either, because the files belong to the state and local law
enforcement agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Just check the back of the DAG-71, the DEA says. Who has to sign
the application?
</P>
<P>
   The attorney for the local agency and a ranking officer.
</P>
<P>
   Sandy Davidson, a First Amendment expert and lawyer who teaches
at the University of Missouri-Columbia, said state law required
Missouri governmental bodies to provide public records they retain.
</P>
<P>
   ``After all, we are talking about the public's business,''
Davidson said. ``In this case we are talking about funding for our
schools.''
</P>
<P>
   Missouri Attorney General Jay Nixon declined to comment on the
records.

RYAN AND BRETT EXPECTED TO BE VOTED INTO HALL OF FAME
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By MURRAY CHASS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   At about this time 14 years ago, Nolan Ryan was asked what he
thought about his race with Steve Carlton for the career strikeout
record.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where do I stand?'' Ryan asked in return.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan was two strikeouts ahead of Carlton, both having passed
Walter Johnson, the longtime record-holder, during the 1983 season.
But it was typical of Ryan that he was not aware that he was No. 1.
He did his work on the mound and let others keep track of the
numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, many of those who kept track will recognize the work
Ryan did on the mound by electing him to the Hall of Fame. George
Brett, the oft-injured but brilliant third baseman, is also
expected to be elected on his first time on the ballot.
</P>
<P>
   At times during the past five years, the required waiting period
for first-time candidates, Robin Yount had also been viewed as a
certain 1999 inductee. But more recently his chances of election
have been considered a toss-up. Carlton Fisk and Dale Murphy are
other first-timers who are expected to receive heavy support.
</P>
<P>
   The voters, 10-year members of the Baseball Writers Association,
have not elected two players to the Hall in one year since 1992;
they have not elected more than two since 1991. Only once have more
than two first-timers made it the same year, and that was in 1936,
the first year the election was held.
</P>
<P>
   Interestingly, when Ryan was well into his career and had
already made his mark on the game, his critics said he would not be
worthy of the Hall of Fame because he did not have an impressive
winning percentage and he walked too many batters.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Ryan holds the record for most career walks (2,795), and
he has the lowest winning percentage (.526) of the 20 pitchers who
gained 300 victories. But no pitcher ever has done what the man
from Alvin, Texas, achieved in his 27-year career, in which he
compiled a 324-292 record with a 3.19 ERA.
</P>
<P>
   How did his race with Carlton turn out? When Ryan struck out
Brad Mills of Montreal on April 27, 1983, he broke Johnson's
56-year-old record of 3,508. Carlton finished that season ahead of
Ryan, 3,709 to 3,677, but when Ryan struck out Chili Davis on Sept.
5, 1984, he nudged ahead of Carlton and never looked back.
</P>
<P>
   Carlton finished with 4,136 strikeouts. When Greg Myers of
California struck out on Sept. 17, 1993, he became Ryan's 5,714th
and last strikeout in 5,387 innings. Not that Ryan would know or
care, but he finished with 38 percent more strikeouts than Carlton,
63 percent more than Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   There was also the matter of Ryan's seven no-hitters. Only one
other pitcher, Sandy Koufax, pitched as many as four no-hitters.
Ryan pitched his first and last no-hitters 18 years apart.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan, who began his major league career with the Mets in 1966,
also holds the record for most seasons played, another of more than
50 records he held or shared when he retired after the 1993 season.
A hard-throwing but erratic right-hander for the Mets, Ryan was one
of four players they traded to the California Angels for Jim
Fregosi on Dec. 10, 1971. The other three players did not have
quite the career Ryan went on to have.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan left the Angels after the 1979 season and became baseball's
first $1 million-a-year player when he signed with the Houston
Astros as a free agent. The Astros, mistakenly thinking that the
41-year-old Ryan was near the end of his career, let him go as a
free agent after the 1988 season, and he pitched another five years
for the Texas Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   When he struck out 301 batters in his first season with the
Rangers, it was the sixth time he had surpassed 300 and the first
since 1977. He also pitched no-hitters Nos. 6 and 7 with the
Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   Brett struck out 18 times against Ryan (Claudell Washington,
with 39, was Ryan's most frequent victim). He also had 29 hits (no
home runs), but his performance against Ryan is not why Brett will
be elected to the Hall.
</P>
<P>
   In his 21 seasons, all with the Kansas City Royals, Brett,
primarily a third baseman, collected 3,154 hits, placing him 13th
among the 21 players who have reached the 3,000-hit plateau. He won
three batting championships while posting a .305 career average.
When he hit .390 in 1980, it was the closest anyone had come to
.400 since Ted Williams batted .406 in 1941.
</P>
<P>
   Brett's career numbers would have been more impressive had he
not been so tough on himself physically. Injuries forced him to
miss the equivalent of approximately two seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Like Brett, Yount spent his entire career, 20 years, with one
team, the Milwaukee Brewers. He got his 3,000th hit in September
1992 and finished with 3,142 hits, now 15th on the list, and a .285
average. Yount is one of only three players (Stan Musial and Hank
Greenberg are the others) to be named most valuable player at two
positions. He won the American League award as a shortstop in 1982
and as a center fielder in 1989.

POLICE KEEPING CASH INTENDED FOR EDUCATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KAREN DILLON  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Police and federal agencies have diverted
millions of dollars from Missouri schoolchildren.
</P>
<P>
   Under state law, money seized in drug cases is supposed to go to
public school districts, but some police departments have found a
simple way to keep the money for their own use.
</P>
<P>
   It works like this:
</P>
<P>
   When police discover a cache of drug money, they turn it over to
a federal agency, which is not subject to state laws. The agency
keeps a cut and returns the rest of the money to police.
</P>
<P>
   Police say some of that windfall is used to fight the war on
drugs. But such transfers to federal agencies hurt taxpayers, who
must pay more for schools. And they clearly violate state law.
</P>
<P>
   ``The full intent (of the law) was to give that money to the
schools, or most of it. They are not getting it,'' said state Rep.
Jim Kreider, a Nixa Democrat and an early backer of the state law.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the public knew this in a large scale, they would not like
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials and some local police say that the seizures of
money are proper and that they've done nothing wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Other law enforcement officials say they believe the law is not
clear about every situation that police confront.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are trying to determine who is right and who is wrong,''
said Capt. James Keathley of the Missouri Highway Patrol, which
often turns over money to federal agents.
</P>
<P>
   Still other departments won't talk at all about the way they
handle federal forfeitures, which is the legal term for the process
of taking money.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Kansas City police said state law did not require
them to answer questions from the media.
</P>
<P>
   But a federal appellate judge, in a written opinion filed in
1998, said it was clear that the federal Drug Enforcement
Administration and the Missouri Highway Patrol had ``successfully
conspired'' in one case to keep forfeited money.
</P>
<P>
   That case led Judge James B. Loken of the 8th U.S. Circuit Court
of Appeals in his opinion to question whether federal agencies were
``using their extensive forfeiture powers to frustrate the fiscal
policy of States such as Missouri.'' The law's intent
</P>
<P>
   The state's fiscal policy was designed to keep forfeiture money
out of the hands of police to prevent a conflict of interest: When
police benefit directly from the money they seize, they might be
tempted to conduct illegal searches to seize assets.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, that's exactly what has happened across the country,
where most states, including Kansas, generally allow police to keep
drug money they seize. Illegal searches and other abuses by police
departments have been well-documented in recent years in such
places as California, Louisiana and Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not so concerned where the money goes as I am concerned
where the money doesn't go,'' said Sen. Francis Flotron, a
Chesterfield Republican who helped write Missouri's forfeiture law.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to create a situation where police have an
incentive to stop people for the benefit of getting stuff for their
own departmental use.''
</P>
<P>
   If the money goes to schools, it not only removes a temptation
from police but also is put to good use, relieving a burden from
school taxpayers, lawmakers say.
</P>
<P>
   So they set up a process. Police who seize money must report it
to the county prosecutor, who along with a judge must decide
whether the money should be forfeited. The forfeited money is sent
to schools or, in special cases, transferred to a federal agency.
</P>
<P>
   But police have found a way to defeat lawmakers' wishes.
</P>
<P>
   Their efforts to keep drug money have been no secret _
legislators tried to fight them off with tougher laws in 1993 _ yet
the police arrangement with federal agencies has been almost
invisible to the public.
</P>
<P>
   That's no accident.
</P>
<P>
   Police and federal agencies go to great lengths not to advertise
their arrangement. In fact, all those contacted by The Kansas City
Star refused to provide public records.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, it's impossible to track how much money law
enforcement has diverted from schools.
</P>
<P>
   But The Star was able to glimpse the windfall for law
enforcement by finding several police reports and court cases that
show how police and federal agencies work together.
</P>
<P>
   In 14 cases in the Kansas City area in recent years, police and
the Highway Patrol seized more than $1.4 million and sent it to
federal agencies. In return, the federal agencies sent most of the
money back to police and the Highway Patrol, usually keeping about
20 percent of it for processing costs.
</P>
<P>
   In each case, legal experts say, a state judge should have
decided where the money would go _ and that's usually to schools.
</P>
<P>
   In one typical instance, Kansas City police stopped two men in
1996 because their car did not have a front license plate. Officers
searched the car with a drug-sniffing dog and found a shoe box with
$22,765 in the front seat, according to police reports. Neither man
was charged with a crime, and although they protested the seizure,
they gave up a challenge to it because of legal costs.
</P>
<P>
   Police turned the money over to the DEA, which later returned
more than $18,000 to the department.
</P>
<P>
   Those 14 cases indicate a pattern of conduct, one expert said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Reasonable inferences could be drawn that this is an attempt
to circumvent the state forfeiture laws to benefit the state
agency,'' said Jimmy Gurule, a law professor at Notre Dame
University and co-author of a legal text on forfeitures.
</P>
<P>
   A few figures suggest how broad the forfeiture diversion by law
enforcement may be. MORE
</P>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ to answer questions.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen L. Hill, U.S. attorney for the Western District of
Missouri, protests Loken's opinion.
</P>
<P>
   ``We disagree with (Judge Loken's) observations both on when the
seizure took place and that there was some kind of effort to
circumvent state law,'' Hill said.
</P>
<P>
   A seizure doesn't occur just because police find the money, said
Frances Reddis, an assistant U.S. attorney.
</P>
<P>
   ``My analogy is, when does an arrest occur?'' Reddis said.
``Police officers often stop people, question them and it is not
considered an arrest until they can't leave.''
</P>
<P>
   Gurule, the Notre Dame legal expert on forfeitures, strongly
disagreed. A seizure occurs when someone is stopped by police, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``To suggest that the seizure of the vehicle and its contents,
the money, occurred sometime later when the DEA arrived at the
scene is ludicrous,'' Gurule said.
</P>
<P>
   Black's Law Dictionary defines a seizure as occurring ``not only
when an officer arrests an individual, but whenever he restrains
the individual's freedom to walk away.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite Loken's opinion, Cole never got his money back _ he
filed his appeal of the forfeiture too late. Reform in the works
</P>
<P>
   Public officials say they will press for reform on almost every
front:
</P>
<P>
   - State law _ Kreider and other legislators say they will push
for new measures when the General Assembly's 1999 session begins
this week.
</P>
<P>
   Some lawmakers would prohibit any drug money at all going to
federal agencies. Others suggest giving police an incentive to work
with the state by letting them keep 50 percent of forfeitures.
</P>
<P>
   - Penalties _ Sen. Ronnie DePasco, a Kansas City Democrat who
was just elected floor majority leader, said it might be necessary
to enact penalties for law enforcement agencies that do not follow
the law.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since there is no penalty clause, they can do whatever they
want to do,'' said DePasco, who also is a member of the Civil and
Criminal Jurisprudence Committee. ``We'll probably have to put a
penalty clause in there to put some teeth in the law.''
</P>
<P>
   - State probe _ Some want the attorney general to investigate.
</P>
<P>
   Nixon, however, has declined to comment on the issue. His office
confirmed that it had talked to the patrol, which asked for an
opinion, but would not elaborate because it regarded the patrol as
a client.
</P>
<P>
   - State audit _ Loewenstein, the Kansas City school board
member, called for an accounting by the state auditor's office.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those entities are going to have to give back...whatever they
took if they indeed did take it,'' he said. ``This is going to be,
I'm sure, not a short affair.''
</P>
<P>
   McCaskill, who takes office as Missouri's new state auditor this
month, said she would review forfeitures. She said she was
disappointed by the pattern of forfeitures The Star had found.
</P>
<P>
   - Police guidelines _ Kansas City Police Board Commissioner Joe
Mulvihill said police needed to set up guidelines if they were not
following state law.
</P>
<P>
   Mulvihill said police hadn't told him about the forfeiture
issue, even after The Star had submitted written questions to the
department.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since the Kansas City Police Department is the largest law
enforcement agency in the area, we have to be perceived by the
public as complying with the law,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   - Federal investigation _ Loken, in his opinion last year,
called on Congress and the Department of Justice to investigate
whether federal agencies were abusing state forfeiture laws.

COMMENTARY: BOWDEN GIVES THIS BOWL GAME THE RIGHT SOUND
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By GEORGE VECSEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, Ariz. _ When football speaks, it does so in a southern
accent. For example, when Bobby Bowden of Florida State voices his
fears that a Tennessee running back will burn him for a long gain,
he calls it ``a big `un,'' and Yankees and Californians and
Dakotans know exactly what he means.
</P>
<P>
   The Fiesta Bowl on Monday night is a ``big `un,'' bringing
together two southern schools in the arid desert air for a national
championship. With Keith Jackson calling his last couple of dozen
``Whoa, Nellies'' on the tube, the game will come straight from the
emotional heart of ``foo'ball,'' the deep south.
</P>
<P>
   Allie Sherman certainly exemplified the southern tinge during
his regime as coach of the professional New York Giants. Allie may
not have consciously done this, but he surely mastered the
linguistic art of saying defensive backs had to ``he'p'' each other
out, thereby obscuring his own origins amidst the spanish moss and
kudzu vines of Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody speaks football better than Bobby Bowden, the gabby
patriarch from Tallahassee, seeking his second national
championship. Bowden is something of a military history buff, but
his main charm is drawing upon the many decades of college football
he has known.
</P>
<P>
   Whereas many college football coaches creep me out with their
edgy sanctimony, Bowden charmed me early in this decade. After
losing to Miami on a swerved field-goal attempt, he appeared at his
mandatory Sunday-morning press wrapup in a serious dark suit, and
somebody asked why he was all dressed up. Bowden chirped, ``Goin'
to church, y'all wanna join me?'' making it sound like an
invitation rather than a challenge.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, anticipating only the second meeting in the glorious
history of Tennessee and the rather nouveau history of Florida
State, Bowden was delighted to talk about Tennessee's influence on
him.
</P>
<P>
   Kids in Birmingham are raised to root for Alabama or maybe even
Auburn, but Bowden was impressed by Tennessee at an early age. He
recalled being around 10 years old, ``layin' on the floor,''
listening to Tennessee play USC on the radio _ probably a blocky
Philco, although Bowden didn't get into that. Bowden also had
Tennessee winning, which is a good trick, considering that
Tennessee is 0-4 against USC over the years, but Bowden was right
in that Tennessee generally won, under its first great coach,
General Bob Neyland, as in Neyland Stadium, the gigantic 107,000
stadium in Knoxville.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee football touched Bowden in a most visceral way when he
was 12 years old and selling newspapers on First Avenue in
Birmingham, where in those pre-Interstate days, the cars from
Knoxville used to rumble into town for the big game with `Bama.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember the long line of traffic, the cars all decorated
orange and white,'' Bowden recalled Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   He also recalled how General Bob's disciples had filtered into
the football cadre throughout the South, to the extent that Bowden
was coached by a Neyland man in high school and a Neyland man in
college.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I heard was Bob Neyland,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Five or six years ago, Bowden did a favor for Phillip Fulmer,
the current Tennessee coach, and appeared at a football gathering
in Knoxville, where they gave him a Bob Neyland Trophy _ ``my
favorite trophy, out of both of `em,'' Bowden said, surely a
practiced line, but it brought chuckles.
</P>
<P>
   He also made me smile when he explained that he still coaches
``because I like rings; they give you a ring whenever you win your
conference or a bowl game.'' He said he still enjoys recruiting,
going to visit ``the mamas and the papas,'' although he did shudder
a bit about his journey to recruit the current backup quarterback,
Jared Jones.
</P>
<P>
   ``Walla Walla, Washington,'' he said, drawing out every syllable
``I love to say that name. It is hard to get to, however. It takes
four hours to fly to Seattle, a missed flight to Walla Walla, bum a
ride with some guy.''
</P>
<P>
   These are not the proper things to do to a 69-year-old body, but
Bowden seems to be holding up. He said he plans to keep coaching
rather than the only two alternatives he sees _ weeding his lawn,
or keeling over the day after retiring. Of course, he said, if he
loses four games some season, ``some young guy'' is going to have
to repair the mess. Three of his four sons are in his business,
which gets more cutthroat all the time.
</P>
<P>
   The first Bowl Championship Series game, No. 1 vs. No. 2, was
awarded to Arizona, and now the local hustlers are whining because
Tennessee and Florida State fans have not swarmed out here to
create the desired four-digit ticket scalper price. Nevertheless,
Bowden's Alabama twang and Fulmer's Tennessee drawl have given this
game a touch of authenticity. Y'all check it out on your Philco,
y'hear?

BELL ATLANTIC DEAL WITH AIRTOUCH IS STILL NOT FINAL 
</HEADLINE>
  (ATTN: Calif.) 
(lb) 
 By SETH SCHIESEL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bell Atlantic Corp. remained in negotiations Sunday to buy
Airtouch Corp., one of the world's biggest wireless telephone
carriers, for more than $45 billion in stock, but an agreement had
not been completed and a final deal remained at least a few days
away, executives close to the talks said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The executives said that while a deal could be announced this
week, it could take until the end of the month for the companies to
finalize the terms of an acquisition. The executives said it was
still possible, though highly unlikely, that the talks could
collapse. Negotiations continued Sunday afternoon at a law firm in
New York, the executives said.
</P>
<P>
   Acquiring Airtouch would catapult Bell Atlantic into a position
of global leadership in the fast-growing market for wireless
communications. Perhaps even more important, acquiring Airtouch,
based in San Francisco, would help give Bell Atlantic the
coast-to-coast wireless network necessary to compete in the United
States against wireless giants including AT&AMP;T Corp. and the Sprint
PCS venture.
</P>
<P>
   Bell Atlantic, the No. 1 local phone company, could pay as much
as $50 billion for Airtouch, the executives said. The price of Bell
Atlantic's shares fell $3.50, to $54, on Thursday on the New York
Stock Exchange amid concerns that paying so much in stock could
dilute Bell Atlantic's future per-share earnings. Airtouch's shares
rose $3.0625, to $72.4375.
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear Sunday which issues remained to be negotiated
between the two companies. It is conceivable that reaching a
valuation for the deal could become more difficult as the
companies' stock prices fluctuate in response to reports of the
talks.
</P>
<P>
   The executives close to the negotiations said that no other
bidder had emerged for Airtouch. Vodafone Group PLC of Britain had
been thought to be interested in acquiring at least Airtouch's
overseas operations.
</P>
<P>
   Some telecommunications executives think that if a second bidder
were to emerge, it could be MCI Worldcom Inc., which does not have
a big wireless business. But Bernard Ebbers, that company's chief
executive, has said that acquiring a wireless operation could
dilute his company's earnings.

PARCELLS AND THE PLAYOFFS ARE TOGETHER AGAIN
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By DAVE ANDERSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HEMPSTEAD, N.Y. _ For a pro football coach, the Super Bowl
playoffs are the test tubes of his career. It's where a compelling
coach separates himself from the merely competent, where he
discovers who he is and what his team is, where he learns how to
win because he has learned why he lost.
</P>
<P>
   It's where Bill Parcells will lead the Jets against the
Jacksonville Jaguars next Sunday in an American Football Conference
divisional playoff, the beginning of what could be his fourth
journey to the Super Bowl. It's where he is still doing at age 57
what he does so well.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't leave any stone unturned,'' the Jets' coach was
saying of this week's practices and meetings. ``You have to be
ready for any eventuality. You have to have all your ammunition,
all your defenses. No surprises.''
</P>
<P>
   Parcells knows. He has two Super Bowl rings, from his 1986 and
1990 Giants teams. He also has the scar from losing the Super Bowl
with the New England Patriots two years ago. In only his second
Jets' season after inheriting a 1-15 team, he knows how to win, but
he also knows the pitfalls.
</P>
<P>
   ``One bad play sends you home,'' he said. ``One holding penalty.
One clip. One fumble. One missed coverage. One missed tackle. One
going to sleep.''
</P>
<P>
   Parcells knows all this because the playoffs have been the story
of his life as a coach. He has endured its emotions from insecurity
to anxiety to success, from depression to euphoria to
disappointment to the next Sunday's unknown.
</P>
<P>
   Of all the active coaches with 100 or more victories in the
National Football League, he has the best playoff record: 10-5.
</P>
<P>
   Of all the coaches with 100 or more victories, his .667
post-season winning percentage shares sixth place on the career
list behind Vince Lombardi (9-1), Weeb Ewbank (4-1), Joe Gibbs
(16-5), Buddy Parker (3-1) and Bill Walsh (10-4).
</P>
<P>
   And now Parcells recounted the story of his life that began in
1984, his second season with the Giants, with a 16-13 wild-card
victory over the Los Angeles Rams in Anaheim, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   ``Early that season we lost to the Rams out there, 33-12,'' he
recalled. ``That put us at 3-2 for the season and if we had gone to
3-5, I would've been finished. But we wound up 9-7 and when we won
that wild-card game, it was a confidence builder, especially on the
road. It told me, `Hey, you can do this.'''
</P>
<P>
   In the divisional playoff in San Francisco, the Giants lost,
21-10.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the 49ers' best team ever; they were 15-1 and went on
to win the Super Bowl,'' he said. ``We got across midfield five
times and didn't score, but this was the beginning of the Giants'
rise. I got the feeling that the organization was thinking, `Hey,
this may be our guy, after all.'''
</P>
<P>
   In 1985, the Giants improved to 10-6, then eliminated the 49ers,
17-3, in a wild-card playoff.
</P>
<P>
   ``Joe Morris was great, 141 yards,'' he said. ``Phil Simms threw
two touchdown passes. The one to Mark Bavaro I can see that now.
Winning that game, we knew we were pretty good.''
</P>
<P>
   But in the divisional playoff in Chicago's cold and windy
Soldier Field, the Giants were blanked, 21-0, by the soon to be
Super Bowl champion Bears.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't believe it when Sean Landeta missed the punt out of
our end zone and they recovered and scored,'' he said. ``Sean was
and still is a great punter and he's always said the wind blew the
ball on him, but I still think he missed it because he was looking
at the rush. All I could think about was that the loss meant
another off-season, another draft, another training camp, another
season, another set of playoffs before we'd have another chance.''
</P>
<P>
   On the chartered flight home, Parcells was sitting with Mickey
Corcoran, his mentor, who had been his high school basketball coach
in Oradell, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was so mad, I hadn't talked to anybody for about four
hours,'' he said. ``Mickey finally turns to me and says, `Hey,
Parcells, you got to figure out a way to beat these guys.' I knew
he was serious because he called me Parcells like he did when I was
in high school. I knew the organization was kind of satisfied. I
remember Wellington Mara telling me, `Well, we had a good year,'
but I was worse than ever. It just made me more determined to do
it.''
</P>
<P>
   The 1986 Giants did it, but not until after Parcells threw a
tantrum and a trash can during the season finale against Green Bay
at Giants Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``We jumped ahead, 21-0, in the first quarter, but then we
relaxed and by halftime, we were up only 24-17,'' he said. ``I was
so mad. In the defensive meeting, I picked up a big plastic trash
can filled with a week's tape, soda cans and snuff cans, and flung
it all on the players, then I threw the can against the back
wall.''
</P>
<P>
   The Giants responded, winning, 55-24, for their ninth straight
and a 14-2 record, then routed the 49ers, 49-3, in the divisional
playoff and the Redskins, 17-0, in the NFC championship game.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was so windy at the championship game, with gusts up to 35
miles an hour, when we won the toss, we took the wind instead of
the ball,'' he said. ``We scored with the wind when Phil Simms hit
Lionel Manuel, then we drove the ball through the wind in the
second quarter for another touchdown. Phil McConkey caught six
punts in that wind, the Redskins' guy didn't catch any.''
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks later, the Giants won their first Super Bowl trophy,
39-20, over the Denver Broncos.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``At the half, we were behind, 10-9,'' he said, ``but in the
third quarter we had 200 yards and they had 2. Simms had that great
game with 22 out of 25, and our fake punt worked. I had vowed that
I would never go to a Super Bowl until my team was in it, and now
my team had won it.''
</P>
<P>
   But with a 6-9 record in the strike-shortened 1987 season, the
Giants missed the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I learned that success is never final,'' he said. ``You can go
right back into the toilet.''
</P>
<P>
   In the 1988 season finale, the Jets knocked the Giants out of
the playoffs, and in 1989, the Giants lost a wild-card playoff to
the Rams, 19-13, in overtime when Flipper Anderson caught a 30-yard
touchdown pass from Jim Everett and kept running into the Giants
Stadium tunnel.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the only time I can say that an official's call cost me
the game _ pass interference on Sheldon White,'' Parcells said.
``The next play, the Rams scored. I learned how one little mistake
can kill you.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, the Giants roared to a 10-0 start but Simms suffered a
broken ankle as the record dipped to 11-3. Jeff Hostetler started
the last two victories and guided a 31-3 rout of the Bears in the
divisional playoff, but no team had ever won the Super Bowl with a
backup quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a good team, but nobody knew it,'' Parcells said.
</P>
<P>
   Good enough to upset the 49ers, 15-13, for the NFC title.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the greatest game I ever coached,'' he said. ``The
49ers were a great team with great players going for a Super Bowl
three-peat. It was the toughest, most physical game any of my teams
have ever been in. When Matt Bahr's fifth field goal went through
to win it, that might be the greatest feeling I've ever had.''
</P>
<P>
   Without the usual two-week wait, the Giants went straight to
Tampa that Sunday night for Super Bowl XXXV.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before we went to San Francisco,'' he said, ``I told the
players to bring enough clothes for 10 days.''
</P>
<P>
   Parcells and his staff also had already prepared a Super Bowl
game plan for the Buffalo Bills.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Bills were a high-scoring team; we wanted to shorten the
game with a ball-control offense and we did,'' he said. ``We only
made one mistake on defense, a wrong call. It would've been a shame
if we lost, but when Scott Norwood lined up for that 47-yard field
goal to beat us, Matt Bahr told me, `He'll miss it. He hasn't made
a 47-yarder on grass all year. He'll over-kick it.' He did.''
</P>
<P>
   Not long after that 20-19 victory, Parcells resigned as the
Giants' coach. In 1994, his second season in New England, the
Patriots were a wild card, but lost in Cleveland, 20-13.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of our receivers dropped a touchdown pass right in his
chest,'' he said. ``The players didn't realize the level of
intensity in the playoffs. They knew they weren't quite ready.''
</P>
<P>
   The 1996 Patriots were ready. In a foggy divisional playoff,
they trounced the Steelers, 28-3, then defeated the Jaguars, 20-6.
As the AFC champions, the Patriots and Parcells suddenly were in
Super Bowl XXXI against the Green Bay Packers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a chance when we closed to within 27-21,'' he said.
``We were hitting our passes.''
</P>
<P>
   On the ensuing kickoff, Desmond Howard streaked 99 yards for the
clinching touchdown in the Packers' 35-21 triumph.
</P>
<P>
   ``We missed two tackles right away on that kickoff,'' Parcells
remembered. ``Two tackles.''
</P>
<P>
   It still haunts him. It always will. It's why the Jets' coach
will be reminding his players this week how ``one bad play sends
you home.'' He knows. He has been a loser in the playoffs five
times. But he also knows that on Jan. 31 in the Super Bowl in
Miami, he could be a winner in the playoffs for the 13th time.

treatment in New York, because of its prestigious doctors, esteemed
reputation for clinical research and the promising drugs trials it
conducts.) While the concentration on cancer is a nationwide
phenomenon, experts say the new competition is particularly fevered
in New York, where there are already more centers that have the
official designation of the National Cancer Institute _ and its
funding _ than in most other regions.

ANALYSIS: A WARM YET WARY U.S. WELCOME FOR THE EURO 
</HEADLINE>
   (See also BRITAIN-EURO, 1999-EURO) 
 (JS) 
 By RICHARD W. STEVENSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ For the last several years, the Clinton
administration has articulated a simple policy toward the single
European currency: Anything that helps build a more prosperous
trading partner on the other side of the Atlantic is good for the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have everything to gain,'' Deputy Treasury Secretary
Lawrence H. Summers said, ``and little to lose from the success of
this momentous project.''
</P>
<P>
   But that policy masks some complex and unresolved issues for the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   If the new currency, the euro, is successful over the long run,
it could pose a threat to the dominance of the dollar as the
world's primary reserve currency, perhaps increasing borrowing
costs for the United States. If it is unsuccessful, the struggle to
make the euro work could endanger the remarkable progress made by
Europe in melding its diverse economies into a single market and
subduing historical animosities under the cover of financial
engineering.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, U.S. officials are prodding European
governments to make sure their focus on getting the euro off to a
good start does not diminish their resolve to deal with Western
Europe's chronic economic problems, most notably its persistently
high unemployment rate.
</P>
<P>
   And, U.S. officials say, Europe should not allow the very real
challenges of monetary union _ which formally began last Thursday
with 11 countries in the European Union locking their currencies to
the new euro _ to turn its attention inward at a time when much of
the world is still struggling to recover from the shocks of the
financial crisis that began last year in Asia.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some have argued that a Europe with a single number in the
global directory might ultimately pose a threat to the United
States,'' Summers said in a speech last month. ``But in a global
economy, the United States has infinitely less to fear from an open
and integrated Europe that continues to take its share in global
responsibilities, than a Europe that turns inward and seeks
insulation.''
</P>
<P>
   To the extent that there has been any debate in Washington
policymaking circles, it has had less to do with the euro itself
than with Europe's economic challenges and its view of its place in
the world.
</P>
<P>
   On one side are those who are optimistic that the euro will
prove to be the spur that Europe needs to unshackle its economies
from excessive regulation and stimulate more growth and jobs
through private investment. On the other side are those who think
Europe is doomed to years of economic underperformance, tinged by
protectionism, as the left-wing governments now in power in France
and Germany stall on long-delayed changes.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a double or nothing bet for Europe,'' said one senior
U.S. official. If the euro works, the official said, Europe will
emerge stronger and more prosperous; if it fails, the continent
will emerge more divided, poorer and less confident.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the questions of political and economic stability, the
benefits to the United States of a successful euro could be
considerable. By replacing the French franc, the German mark and
nine other national currencies with a single European currency, the
program should make it easier and less expensive for U.S. companies
to sell their products and services. Multinational U.S. companies
are already among the largest in Europe, and many mid-sized and
smaller U.S. exporters are increasingly looking to Europe for
growth. But Britain, the most popular location for U.S. business
interests, has chosen not to adopt the euro for now.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we are going to see significant advantages go to those
companies who had already viewed Europe as a single market, which a
lot of our bigger companies already have done,'' said David L.
Aaron, the undersecretary of commerce for international trade.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, he said, eliminating fluctuating exchange rates should
create competitive pressures in Europe that will narrow price
variations among countries, favoring cost-conscious U.S. companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Prices are going to fall,'' Aaron said. ``That will increase
demand and put more money in consumers' hands. That's going to have
a positive effect on the European economy, and that will be good
for the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   While U.S. officials say the potential economic threats to the
United States from a successful euro are too often overstated, they
are nonetheless real.
</P>
<P>
   A euro representing the might of nations whose economies
together already rival that of the United States in size could
eventually draw away some of the influence and financial power that
the United States has long enjoyed by virtue of having the world's
dominant currency.
</P>
<P>
   David Hale, an economist at Zurich Kemper Investments in
Chicago, compares the introduction of the euro to the formation
more than eight decades ago of the Federal Reserve system in the
United States. Before it had a central bank, the United States had
no uniform monetary policy and although it had a nearly equivalent
share of world trade to Britain, the country accounted for a
minuscule share of global finance.
</P>
<P>
   The dollar now accounts for nearly 60 percent of global foreign
currency reserves, almost four times as much as the European
currencies combined. And although it is difficult to predict how
fast that situation will change, a successful euro would certainly
reduce the dollar's hegemony in international finance over the long
run. That could make it more expensive for Americans to borrow in
an increasingly global capital market.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until now the fragmentation of Europe and the national nature
of the central banks has inhibited the international use of the
currencies,'' Hale said. ``But at some point there will be a moment
when international capital demand and additional competition for
global savings hurts the ability of the United States to fund its
external deficits because there will be competition to the
dollar.''
</P>
<P>
   There is also some question about whether the United States will
continue to benefit from the desire of people in other countries to
hold dollars instead of their local currencies _ a practice that
amounts to a huge interest-free loan to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   By some estimates, a majority of dollars in circulation are
outside the United States, held by everyone from Russians desperate
to avoid the effects of a ruble depreciation to drug smugglers and
arms merchants who need a currency they can move around the world
with ease.
</P>
<P>
   And the Europeans seem to have taken that potential role into
account in devising their new currency, which will start
circulating as coins and bills within the next three years. The
largest European bill will be a 500-euro denomination, worth about
$550, while the largest U.S. bill remains $100.

2 KHMER ROUGE DEFECTORS END TOUR AND RETURN TO JUNGLE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By SETH MYDANS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia _ Two Khmer Rouge leaders ended their
six-day grand tour of the country Sunday and returned to a remote
jungle town that has become a well-guarded haven for defectors from
the Communist movement, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The leaders, Khieu Samphan and Nuon Chea, came in from the cold
on Dec. 25, then were escorted around a nation that is still
painfully rebuilding from the ruin the Khmer Rouge inflicted
between 1975 and 1979, when more than a million people died.
</P>
<P>
   The tour has been offered to previous defectors, in part to try
to disabuse them of the continuing belief among many Khmer Rouge
that the country is still under the thumb of its neighbor, Vietnam,
and that Cambodians are ready to rise up in the Khmer Rouge's
support.
</P>
<P>
   After being welcomed here by Prime Minister Hun Sen, who was
himself once a member of the Khmer Rouge, they visited the beach
resort of Sihanoukville, then spent a night at the ancient temples
of Angkor.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said they returned Sunday to Pailin, a remote town on
the border with Thailand, which has given sanctuary to the Khmer
Rouge in the past. Some 2,000 Khmer Rouge soldiers are also
stationed there, nominally part of the government army following
their defections over the last two years but still answering to
their Khmer Rouge commanders.
</P>
<P>
   In recent statements, Hun Sen has left his options open over
whether to accede to international demands that top Khmer Rouge
figures be put on trial for crimes against humanity.
</P>
<P>
   Several, but not all, of these figures _ including the former
Khmer Rouge foreign minister, Ieng Sary _ have gathered in Pailin,
a drab and eerie town populated by men with hard faces and cold
eyes.
</P>
<P>
   If any of the leaders are to be produced for trial, some new
agreement with the Khmer Rouge who control Pailin will be needed,
along with the cooperation of Thailand.
</P>
<P>
   The Thais have strenuously denied helping the Khmer Rouge in the
last 20 years, both during and after a civil war in which the
Communist guerrillas fought Hun Sen's troops from sanctuaries along
the border.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to tart criticism of this relationship by Hun Sen,
Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai of Thailand said Sunday that Cambodia
was trying to ``pass the buck'' to Thailand and to divert attention
from its own difficulties regarding the handling of Khmer Rouge
defectors.

SPENDING PLAN CAN PREPARE YOU FOR RAINY AND SUNNY DAYS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DEBORAH ADAMSON  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- You overspent again this Christmas. January is
here and the big bills are coming. You dread it, but feel hopeless
about budgeting for next time.
</P>
<P>
   You're not the only one who dislikes budgets.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Hunt, editor of the Cheapskate Monthly newsletter in
Paramount, Calif., hates the word ``budget.'' Instead, she prefers
the term ``spending plan.'' It may be splitting hairs, but attitude
and outlook carry great weight.
</P>
<P>
   Budgeting brings to mind restrictions, cutbacks in lifestyle and
other awful things. Spending plan carries the connotation of a
strategy that puts the consumer in the driver's seat. As such, it
sounds a lot more palatable.
</P>
<P>
   For people who don't save, who live life on the edge, who
naively hope that it will work out somehow, Hunt said they're
putting themselves at great risk.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's called being in bondage, living by fear, living on the
edge. That's putting yourself in horrible financial jeopardy,'' she
said. ``Freedom is knowing what you have and how much you are
spending. You've got all the bills paid and you've got something
extra. Freedom is not looking the other way and hoping things will
work out.''
</P>
<P>
   People who don't plan financially are not prepared for life's
curveballs and everyone gets them, Hunt added.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a step-by-step plan to set up a budget:
</P>
<P>
   1. Diagnose the situation. Get 30 or 31 index cards, one for
each day of the month. Track your daily spending. Three bucks a day
for a cafe au lait? Jot it down. Stick the index card in your
wallet. At the end of each month, you might be surprised that you
spent $60 on morning coffee alone. The goal of this exercise is to
look for money leaks and plug them.
</P>
<P>
   2. Categorize your expenses. Don't exceed 20 categories but make
them no fewer than 15 so your categories won't be too general.
</P>
<P>
   For example, you may list expenses under home mortgage, home
maintenance, auto payments, auto maintenance, entertainment,
groceries, consumer debt, utilities, medical bills, gifts, personal
or household expenses, insurance, taxes, child care or child
support, charity and miscellaneous.
</P>
<P>
   3. Keep track of where the money goes. You probably don't
realize how much you're spending at the vending machine at work.
The goal is to trim costs to give you some financial breathing
room. These savings can be used to pay off a credit card bill or
for investing.
</P>
<P>
   4. Once you've identified what you can save, set up an automatic
deposit plan at work where a certain amount, say $50, is taken out
of your salary and put directly into a savings account or mutual
fund. For people without the willpower to save themselves --
there's always something you feel you need to buy -- this is a
no-brainer. What you don't see, you don't miss. It works.
</P>
<P>
   5. Set up a freedom account. This is fun money for vacations and
such. You'll enjoy your vacation or leisure activity more if you
know you're paying for it upfront, not piling the cost on your
credit cards. You also may want to set up a savings account to pay
for next year's Christmas presents.
</P>
<P>
   These easy steps can make a dramatic impact on your life.
Imagine the stress you'll avoid by actually having money tucked
away for expenses.

ST. CROIX BETS IT FUTURE ON CASINOS 
</HEADLINE>
  (ATTN: Miss.) 
(mk) 
 By MIREYA NAVARRO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. CROIX, U.S. Virgin Islands _ When Lisa Newkirk-Svarczkopf
heard that casinos would soon open in this, the biggest of the
three U.S. Virgin Islands, she moved her clothing store to a
location three times the size of the old one in anticipation of a
tourism boom.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I was getting a jump start on things by moving to a
bigger spot,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, the move was four years off and Ms.
Newkirk-Svarczkopf had to move back to a smaller store. But her
excitement and that of other St. Croix residents has not abated as
the first casino is scheduled to open here this fall. In a region
battered by four major hurricanes in the last decade, casinos are
seen as a catalyst to help bring back the economic prosperity that
all but vanished in September 1989, when Hurricane Hugo left 90
percent of the buildings damaged and more than 20,000 people
homeless.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the beginning of our turnaround,'' Ms. Newkirk-Svarczkopf
said. ``We know it's just a matter of time because we know what a
beautiful island this is.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though the Caribbean is full of islands with casinos, the
American Virgin Islands, where tourism accounts for two-thirds of
the economy, had resisted starting their own for years. In a 1992
referendum both St. Croix and St. Thomas voted the idea down,
concerned with the unsavory aspects of gambling.
</P>
<P>
   But the economic need for more tourism in St. Croix, a less
popular tourist destination than St. Thomas and St. John,
increasingly made residents here see casinos as a necessary evil.
In another referendum four years ago, St. Thomas still said no but
St. Croix's 60,000 residents relented.
</P>
<P>
   Moving cautiously, however, the U.S. Virgin Islands' Legislature
has limited the number of casinos to a maximum of six and allowed
them only as a means to increase the number of hotel rooms in St.
Croix, which now stands at about 1,000, or half of what it was
before Hurricane Hugo, officials here said. In order to get a
license, a casino operator would have to build a hotel or renovate
an existing one to add new rooms.
</P>
<P>
   ``We never talk about casinos. We talk about casino-hotels,''
said Eileen Petersen, a former territorial court judge who chairs
the islands' new Casino Control Commission. ``Our goal is to
surpass what it was before the hurricane.''
</P>
<P>
   Hotels are vital to what government officials describe as an
economic chain reaction _ more hotels mean more tax dollars to
promote tourism, which would in turn lead to more visitors, more
airline flights from the mainland, where most visitors to the
islands come from, and, it is hoped, lower fares.
</P>
<P>
   Airlines usually carry that most desirable breed of tourist _
the overnight guest. Government figures show that, in 1997, 1.6
million cruise ship passengers spent $288.3 million in the American
Virgin Islands. Land-based travelers were far fewer that year,
410,000, but spent almost as much, $281.6 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cruise ships are really not doing it,'' said Noel Loftus,
president of the St. Croix Chamber of Commerce. ``Cruise ships are
getting larger and have their own stores. Passengers are spending
less and less money.''
</P>
<P>
   St. Croix, however, lags behind its two sister islands in all
tourism. In the first three quarters of 1998, government figures
show, St. Thomas and St. John together welcomed more than 315,000
airline visitors and 1.2 million cruise passengers. St. Croix
received 111,000 airline passengers and fewer than 126,000 cruise
ship visitors during the same period.
</P>
<P>
   St. Thomas has made a name for its duty-free shopping district,
and St. Jones, most of which is an unspoiled national park, for its
natural beauty. But St. Croix, which combines elements of the two
and has found it more difficult to create a separate identity, is
bigger, friendlier and offers less predictable attractions, like
West Indian and Danish colonial historic sites, its residents note.
</P>
<P>
   Cruzans, as the locals are known, blame favoritism in government
advertising for much of their woes, a charge government officials
explain by saying that promotional dollars come from hotel taxes
and St. Thomas has four times as many.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're rather paranoid about feeling they always get the
short end of the stick,'' the American Virgin Islands tourism
commissioner, Wylie Whisonant, said of St. Croix. ``It's like a
sibling rivalry.''
</P>
<P>
   And, he added, even if more tourists were directed St. Croix's
way, ``Where are people going to stay?''
</P>
<P>
   Enter casinos.
</P>
<P>
   St. Croix's first casino is scheduled to open in September in
the island's scenic eastern end, on the grounds of a hotel resort
that was destroyed by Hurricane Hugo and is now being rebuilt as
the 200-room Divi Carina Bay Resort and Casino. The hotel, owned by
Grapetree Shores, Inc., is expected to open a few months ahead of
the casino, in April or May.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The casino license went to Grapetree Shores' partner, Treasure
Bay Corp., a Mississippi casino operator that is investing $6.8
million here, moderate by industry standards, on a
10,000-square-foot casino with 275 slot machines, 12 table games
and an estimated 132 employees. By law, the government will take 8
percent of the casinos' annual gross revenue for the first two
years, and up to 12 percent by the fifth year. The casino has also
agreed to give at least 80 percent of the casino jobs to Virgin
Islands residents.
</P>
<P>
   Bernie Burkholder, president and CEO of Treasure Bay, said he
expects his property to capture about half of what he estimates is
now a $20 million casino market in St. Croix. He said the market
has great potential for growth if more tourists come.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously there's a lot of competition in the Caribbean,'' he
said in a telephone interview from Biloxi, Miss. ``A big percentage
of tourists are going to come from the United States and they'll
fly over the Bahamas and Puerto Rico and other places with casinos
to get to St. Croix.''
</P>
<P>
   But, he said, ``We feel a well-executed, quality property will
be able to compete. We will compete well against the older, more
dated properties.''
</P>
<P>
   In the shopping district of Christiansted, store owners said
they expected nothing but economic good from the first casino
venture.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will help bring in the Marriotts and the Hiltons,'' said
Rob Low, owner of The Gold Shop jewelry store. ``This is going to
give the bigger-name hotels a reason to come. Then the airline
would start adding flights.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Casino Control Commission, the hope was to earn respect
as a world-class gaming jurisdiction.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want people to feel that when they gamble in the Virgin
Islands the games are fair and honest,'' Petersen said. ``The best
that can happen is that we have six fabulous, widely recognized
casino-hotels and that the community is happy that it invested
time, money and energy in this venture.''
</P>
<P>
   With so much at stake, Treasure Bay officials cannot help but
feel the pressure.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm concerned sometimes that maybe the expectations are too
high and people would be disappointed,'' Burkholder said. ``I know
a lot of people are watching _ the people in St. Croix, the
investment community.''
</P>
<P>
   But while casinos are not a panacea for the island's troubles,
he said, they could make a difference if their success helps
stimulate other investment.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're the catalyst but we won't by ourselves double the
tourism,'' he said. ``But in two or three years that can happen.''

WAITING FOR WIRELESS-COMPUTING VISION TO MATERIALIZE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By JOHN MARKOFF   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALO ALTO, Calif. _ In Silicon Valley there is perhaps no
greater mystery than why it has taken anytime-anywhere wireless
computing so long to arrive.
</P>
<P>
   Wireless data, after all, is not a new concept among the
computer cognoscenti who frequent the coffee bars, restaurants and
bookstores that line the avenue leading to the Stanford University
campus.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the idea was sketched out clearly as long ago as 1972 by
two Xerox researchers, Alan Kay and Adele Goldberg, in a
never-realized concept for a portable computing device they called
the Dynabook. From the start, the Dynabook was intended to allow
its owner to compute and retrieve information while sitting under a
tree in a meadow.
</P>
<P>
   For many years, the more enterprising of Silicon Valley's
hardware hackers have built their own experimental wireless
systems.
</P>
<P>
   There are even some promising signs in the consumer marketplace.
For example, two-way pagers with tiny keyboards have recently
gained some popularity, and the widely popular Nokia 6160 PCS phone
being offered by AT&AMP;T Corp. has the ability to receive short e-mail
messages.
</P>
<P>
   Wireless computing is, in short, a universally shared vision.
Yet, in the immortal and slightly skeptical words of the former
Byte magazine columnist Jerry Pournelle, its realization is still
scheduled to arrive ``real soon now.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem, depending on whom you ask, is either that a number
of barriers remain, ranging from low bandwidth to the lack of
compelling applications, or that the Valley's visionaries have
simply been out of step with consumers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're still in the snooping-around phase of wireless data,''
said Jerry Purdy, president of Mobile Insights, a Mountain View,
Calif., computer and communications consulting firm, who is one of
those with the former view. ``We're still trying to get it right.''
</P>
<P>
   Others are more pessimistic.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a zero-billion-dollar industry,'' said Geoff
Goodfellow, founder of Radiomail, the first wireless electronic
mail company. Goodfellow left Radiomail after failing to create a
broad consumer market, and the company is now owned by Motorola
Inc. Renamed Blue Kite, it is attempting to offer specialized
wireless services for corporate applications.
</P>
<P>
   For evidence that wireless data may be a harder sell than the
industry's optimists believe, consider the travails of Metricom,
the wireless Internet company that has deployed an innovative
network in the metropolitan areas of Seattle, San Francisco and the
District of Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   Now owned by Microsoft's co-founder, Paul Allen, Metricom offers
unlimited access to the Internet for $30 a month via its Ricochet
radio modem, which is the size of a deck of cards and offers a
speed of 20 kilobits a second. Though that is much slower than
today's fastest modems, which transmit data at more than 50
kilobits a second, the Ricochet's dependability and wireless
convenience have earned it wild praise from many of Metricom's
subscribers.
</P>
<P>
   Yet this high satisfaction and three years of aggressive
marketing have netted Metricom only about 20,000 subscribers
nationwide, and Allen will soon be forced to inject more cash if
the company is to survive.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, despite the disappointing markets for Radiomail,
Metricom and even AT&AMP;T's cellular digital packet data network,
which allows data transmission over telephones, there is no
shortage of fresh initiatives to bring on the wireless digital
future.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, Palm Computing, the division of 3Com Corp.
that makes hand-held computing devices, introduced, with great
fanfare, the Palm VII, a shirt-pocket-sized product that will offer
instant access to Internet data and e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   Scheduled to be available sometime this year, the device will
sell for about $800, and data access will cost about 30 cents for
1,000 characters.
</P>
<P>
   Its backers argue that the Palm VII will succeed for the same
reasons the original Palm won a devoted following _ instant access
to information, in this case via the Internet, without the hassle
of having to boot up a full-scale personal computer.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ability to get information without waiting is really
important,'' said Donna Dubinsky, a Palm co-founder who left the
company early last year to found Handspring Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Palm's announcement is likely to be followed soon by a similar
wireless Internet data announcement from Steve Jobs, founder and
interim chief executive of Apple Computer. The computer industry is
keeping a careful eye on Apple's plans because the company has a
demonstrated knack for coming up with user-friendly software and
services.
</P>
<P>
   Several industry insiders said they believed that Jobs had
struck a deal with AT&AMP;T to use its wireless data networks to
connect portable and desktop computers to the Internet. Neither
company will comment.
</P>
<P>
   Still, even Jobs, who is widely admired in Silicon Valley, may
have his work cut out for him.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, the proverbial ``killer application'' of wireless
appears not to be e-mail. Anytime-anywhere messaging is essential
for a few on-the-go high-technology workers but apparently not for
the average consumer, who has steadfastly ignored any wireless text
messaging system larger or more expensive than a pager.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the optimists insist that the realization of wireless is
only a question of time and that all the drawbacks will vanish with
the advent of third-generation broad-band wireless data networks
scheduled to go online in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   In an industry long accustomed to successfully marketing
technologies that people didn't know they needed, the optimists are
gambling that the ability to send megabits of data to a hand-held
gadget each second will eventually generate the elusive killer app.

   GA-MILLER _ ATLANTA _ As Zell Miller leaves the political
spotlight after more than 30 years, including eights as governor,
his popularity among Georgians is the highest for a governor since
polling began. Immediately upon taking office, he embarked on his
get-tough on criminals promises and built his plan for a Georgia
lottery, which was approved toward the end of his first term. ``I
plowed deep the first term, and smoothed it out the second term,''
Miller said in an October interview. The national political
audience met him as one of the keynote speakers at the 1992
Democratic National Convention, when he delivered a fiery address
laiden with echoes of the Democratic Party's roots in Roosevelt and
social responsibility. But three weeks later, The New York Times
called him an ``unidentified man'' in a front-page photo of Clinton
walking with governors at a National Governors Association meeting.

 By ANDREW C. REVKIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Jack Hardy perched in a leather chair in the cramped
living room of his Greenwich Village walk-up, cocking an ear as his
old Martin guitar was passed around and half a dozen songwriters
took turns trying out new tunes.
</P>
<P>
   The songs described everything from the life and times of
Goliath _ ``He could have been a great hero,/But the Lord had other
plans . . .'' _ to dawn in Las Vegas, ``when the cards are
asleep.''
</P>
<P>
   Some were works in progress with melodies and lyrics that
collided like drunk drivers. Others were finely honed. But none
were more than a week old, as per the house rules _ a breed of
music that Hardy has for the last 16 years called ``fast folk.''
</P>
<P>
   Hardy, wispy-voiced, elfin, iron-willed and a decade or two
older than anyone else in the room, took his turn, trying out a new
ballad about a boy who dreamed of pirates.
</P>
<P>
   As each tune ended, the other writers applauded with muffled
finger snapping instead of clapping, echoing days when
beat-generation assemblages gathered in similar Village nooks. Then
the critiques flowed, almost as liberally as the Portuguese wine,
which was left by a friend.
</P>
<P>
   Weekly, usually on Monday night, songwriters trek to Hardy's
flat from as far as Boston and Philadelphia to be part of a song
swap that has taken place, in one venue or another, since the late
1970s. Alumni include Shawn Colvin, Suzanne Vega and Lyle Lovett.
</P>
<P>
   The meetings are a laboratory for performers seeking to be part
of what remains of the modern folk tradition that emerged in the
early 1960s, bloomed again in the early 1980s and percolates
quietly today.
</P>
<P>
   Hardy settled in New York City in the mid-1970s. When he
arrived, Bob Dylan and most of the other progenitors of the first
folk revival had long since departed. In their wake, folk music was
most familiar as the commercial pop form perfected by
singer-songwriters like James Taylor and Jackson Browne. In New
York City clubs, the emerging sounds were disco and punk.
</P>
<P>
   But Hardy tracked down the few hardened folkies who still
frequented Village coffeehouses and set about making his kind of
music.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the middle of everybody complaining that they had no place
to play, no one booking them or recording them,'' said Richard
Meyer, a songwriter and longtime associate of Hardy's, ``he'd say,
`Okay, let's build a club, let's have a weekly meeting, let's make
our own albums.' He said he was Tom Sawyer getting people to
whitewash the fence.''
</P>
<P>
   His work eventually centered on a musical cooperative that he
founded with a coterie of independent-minded performers in 1982,
first called the Co-op and later the Fast Folk Musical Magazine. He
and his compatriots, trying to capture the sound of the moment,
invited a steady stream of the performers frequenting Gerdes Folk
City, the Cornelia Street Cafe and a club of their own creation,
the Speak Easy, to record their latest work on a tape deck in an
attic in Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   Once a month, the songs were compiled on low-budget LP's, and
later CD's, and distributed to subscribers and radio stations, with
an accompanying newsletter. One hundred master tapes of these
recordings, along with the organization's archives, were donated
last fall to the Smithsonian Institution, which will release the
recordings on CD's in the next few months on a label called
Smithsonian Fast Folk.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole idea was to do it fast,'' Hardy said of the music.
``You could hear a song at an open mike or songwriters' meeting and
two weeks later it was being played on the radio in Philadelphia or
Chicago. It was urgent, exciting. It was in your face.''
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, Hardy alienated many musicians with his
autocratic style, many of his peers said. He forbade performers to
sell their own cassettes at early Fast Folk concerts, as part of an
aversion to commercialism.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone harrumphed,'' said David Massengill, a Fast Folk
pioneer who records for Plump Records now. ``He would forget that
people were not just trying to make a career but also trying to
make a living.''
</P>
<P>
   But Hardy always has been eager to hear and record compelling
songs, no matter who wrote them. ``You had the schlump in the
corner who couldn't tune his guitar or the people who are famous
now,'' Meyer said. ``And Jack was equally committed to talking to
the guy in the corner.''
</P>
<P>
   In Ms. Colvin's early days in New York City, she was mainly a
backup singer dubbing harmonies in the attic sessions. Michelle
Shocked, a prominent songwriter today, got her start stapling Fast
Folk newsletters. Ms. Vega, fresh out of Barnard College, had a
song in the inaugural copy of Fast Folk Musical Magazine, five
years before her big hit ``Luka.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Vega said that during her involvement with Fast Folk in the
early 1980s she often battled with Hardy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to puncture him, to bring him down to street level,''
she said. Nonetheless, she said, ``those were probably some of the
best years I can remember.'' She added, ``We had a tribe, and Jack
was the nucleus of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Hardy's road to the Village was fittingly rebellious. He grew up
mainly in New York City and Aspen, Colo., surrounded by classical
music. His father, Gordon, was for many years dean of students at
the Juilliard School and director of the Aspen Music Festival.
</P>
<P>
   At the University of Hartford, Hardy played in a band called
Some Dead Bears, which sometimes propped a portrait of Che Guevara
onstage. He also edited a student newspaper, The News-Liberated
Press, and in 1969 was convicted of libeling President Richard M.
Nixon by publishing a lewd cartoon that attacked him. The
conviction and $50 fine were overturned on appeal.
</P>
<P>
   He moved to the Village in 1973, and over the years, both he and
Fast Folk have found ways to carry on. The recording project has
been dormant for two years, largely because of a lack of
volunteers, and because many musicians are finding it easier to
record their own CD's.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the organization is focusing on the Fast Folk Cafe, a
vestpocket club in TriBeCa that Hardy, Meyer and others opened in
1996. The club has struggled to pay its bills, fought city
officials over increasingly stringent rules for live music clubs.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the songs tested in Hardy's apartment and on the
recordings are imbued with influences ranging from the dire imagery
of grunge rock to hip-hop beats, although the music remains
stripped down, with the focus on unvarnished lyrics and melody,
with a vocal harmony or bass guitar added, but little else.
</P>
<P>
   The songs now vary from Massengill's 20-minute ballads, to
romantic-comic ditties by Christine Lavin to earnest anthems, like
Julie Gold's 1990 Grammy Award-winning song, ``From a Distance.''
</P>
<P>
   Hardy is beginning to be recognized for his role as a
songwriter. In his own songs, has been less apt to incorporate new
musical ideas, instead working to hone ever more sharply his vision
of the song as a kind of deeply researched message, with buried
allusions to mythological figures.
</P>
<P>
   Until last year he never had a record contract, insisting on
recording his Celtic-tinged ballads himself. His eleventh album and
a pair of five-CD box sets were released this year on a small
independent label, 1-800-PrimeCD.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he remains a largely invisible musical force, with his
most enthusiastic following in Europe and among his peers. ``I'm
undoubtedly the least famous person with a boxed set,'' Hardy said.
</P>
<P>
   The Monday night sessions have continued. Mainly, Hardy
explained, the song swaps force him, like the other participants,
to keep on writing.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   On one recent evening, with noodles cooking next to iron
skillets filled with tomato sauce and hot peppers, he and the other
songwriters, a half a dozen veterans of the swaps, all male, took
their turns through two cycles of tunes. When it came time to sing,
each participant would unfold some scribbled or typed sheet and lay
it on a rickety stool that served as a music stand.
</P>
<P>
   Hardy's new song about a little boy with pirate dreams was
gently dissected by Tim Robinson, a magazine illustrator from
Brooklyn who is a regular at the swaps and performs almost every
week at a handful of clubs that present acoustic music.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson, 35, questioned Hardy's choice of a calypso beat. ``I'm
borderline sappy anyway,'' Hardy explained. ``Besides, I've done so
many dirges lately I just thought I needed an upbeat one.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Laureanno, 38, an electrical engineer who drove nearly
four hours from Wakefield, R.I., tried out a tune he co-wrote, via
e-mail, with a friend from western Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Hillman, 28, a high-school tutor, sang about the bleakness
of Las Vegas at dawn, something he experienced on a brief visit for
a bachelor party two weeks earlier: ``In the morning there's an
Oklahoma man playing two-dollar hands with his wife/And the keno
brigade meets the lowlifes who played through the night.''
</P>
<P>
   Hardy broke the respectful silence that followed. ``You've hit a
home run, Bobby,'' he said. Hillman reacted with a knowing smile
that intimated he knew as much.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the evening, the circle returned to Laureanno.
``Did you have another one, Mikey?'' Hardy asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, but it's pretty lame,'' Laureanno said, who gently tried
to avoid singing another of his songs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't take our work from us,'' Hardy pleaded, with a chuckle.
</P>
<P>
   Laureanno, backed into a musical corner, complied.

KROLL BUYS SILICON VALLEY COMPUTER-SECURITY FIRM 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JOHN MARKOFF   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Anticipating an era in which fighting computer crime will be as
big a business as Internet commerce, Kroll O'Gara Co., the private
security and investigation company in New York, said it would
announce Monday that it was acquiring Securify Inc., a small
Silicon Valley computer-security firm, for $55.2 million in stock.
</P>
<P>
   Securify is among the small but rapidly growing consulting firms
that have sprung up as tens of thousands of corporations connect to
the Internet. Its acquisition by Kroll shows that security
companies are beginning to recognize the rapidly increasing risks
in cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   The deal, which was finalized after the close of the market on
Thursday, the last day of trading in 1998, will permit Kroll to
expand its small business in computer-security consulting, computer
crime and computer-fraud prevention.
</P>
<P>
   Kroll O'Gara will acquire Securify in exchange for 1.4 million
shares of stock, totaling $55.2 million. As part of the deal, an
additional 211,000 shares will be used as incentives to persuade
Securify employees to stay with the company.
</P>
<P>
   Kroll executives said the company had explored a large part of
the computer- security industry before settling on Securify, based
in Mountain View, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very familiar with that community,'' said Jules Kroll,
chief executive of Kroll O'Gara. ``We felt the credentials and bona
fides of the people at Securify are a combination of intellectual
and academic as well as those who have been out there doing it in
the cyberstreets. It's a nice combination.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the last decade, he said, Kroll's traditional business of
investigating business fraud has become increasingly
computer-oriented.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been on the fringes of the business for a long time,''
Kroll said. ``It became abundantly clear to us that we could not
grow in the business by making incremental hires.''
</P>
<P>
   Securify was founded earlier this year by two computer-security
experts, Tahar Elgamal and Dan Kolkowitz. Elgamal had been chief
scientist at Netscape Communications Corp., where he helped create
Internet security standards widely used in commercial transactions
online. Kolkowitz has computer-security experience at Silicon
Valley companies, including Tandem Computers and Bridge
Communications.
</P>
<P>
   As both large financial institutions and small Internet
start-ups begin to rely on the Internet for business transactions,
risks are being created that are not always adequately addressed by
available hardware and software.
</P>
<P>
   Securify has focused both on auditing companies' hardware and
software for potential risks and on assisting those who have been
victims of either outside electronic intruders or insider computer
fraud.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have specialized in developing encryption, authentication
and monitoring technologies,'' said Kolkowitz, who is Securify's
vice president for engineering. The company will provide Kroll with
both a business and intellectual presence in Silicon Valley, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The complexity of today's Internet-based financial systems has
left many financial institutions unable to adequately assess risks,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   For example, many companies are now creating so-called virtual
private networks, which allow different branches to communicate
through the Internet. However, this does not entirely secure a
company's computer network activities, which may remain vulnerable
to insider fraud, the largest type of computer crime.
</P>
<P>
   Traditional corporate security issues have been vastly
complicated by computer networks, Kroll said. He cited the Year
2000 computer problem as a potential new area of vulnerability. In
the last-minute dash to fix the problem, many companies have been
hiring temporary workers and consultants _ often without properly
considering the consequences of providing access to their computer
systems, he said.

QUIETLY, THE JETS PREFER PLAYING THE JAGUARS
</HEADLINE>
  (See also FBN-ANDERSON-PARCELLS)

c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   None of the Jets _ and especially their coach _ came right out
and said it, but an anonymous poll of the players might well have
shown that they are quite content to meet the Jacksonville Jaguars,
and not the Miami Dolphins, in the divisional playoff game on
Sunday at Giants Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, that hardly will be the official party line now that
Jacksonville _ with its erratic 25-10 victory over the inefficient
New England Patriots Sunday _ is the opponent. But as the Pro
Bowl-bound linebacker Mo Lewis said after having seen
Jacksonville's films last week, ``Look at the advantage we have on
them, and they don't have on us.''
</P>
<P>
   The Jets spent three days of their bye week focusing on
Jacksonville, an American Conference Central Division team which
the Jets have not faced in two seasons. But Jets Coach Bill
Parcells knows Jacksonville Coach Tom Coughlin, who was Parcells'
wide-receivers coach for three seasons with the Giants, including
the 1990 Super Bowl championship team.
</P>
<P>
   Preparation has been a hallmark of the Jets this season,
especially with their ever-changing defenses orchestrated by
Assistant Head Coach, Bill Belichick. After having successfully
contained the scrambling quarterbacks Doug Flutie and Steve McNair,
Belichick will try to construct a defense that can contain a
hobbled quarterback, Mark Brunell.
</P>
<P>
   Brunell played gallantly, but stolidly, Sunday and admitted
afterward that ``footwork is something I have to work on this
week.'' He has a high-ankle sprain and was forced to return a week
earlier than he had planned.
</P>
<P>
   A healthy Vinny Testaverde knows the Jaguars, though. He faced
them six times in the three seasons before he came to the Jets, and
he has an 0-6 record against them as a starter.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's irrelevant,'' Testaverde said of his record against the
Jaguars, as he contemplated playing them again. ``I played Miami
this year and I had never beaten them.'' The Jets beat the Dolphins
twice.
</P>
<P>
   Miami will face the Broncos in Denver on Saturday, and that
winner will meet either the Jets or Jaguars in the American
Conference championship on Jan. 17.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't look at what's happened in the past and say, `Well,
we're not going to do well because I haven't had success against
them,''' said Testaverde. ``I stay within the strengths of my
team.''
</P>
<P>
   This Jets team, he contended, has so many more weapons than the
Cleveland and Baltimore teams he had led against the Jaguars.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a different team,'' he said. ``I always had a lot of
respect for Jacksonville and the ability they have. They're banged
up a little bit, yeah, but they always seem to have guys who come
in and work within a system. It helped going over the films of
their games during the week.''
</P>
<P>
   What he and many of the offensive players saw was Jacksonville's
zone blitz, a favored AFC Central tactic in which the defensive
linemen slip back into pass coverage, freeing linebackers to blitz.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something we haven't seen too much this year,''
Testaverde said, ``but it helped that we saw extra days of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis said of the Jaguars: ``They're very explosive, with a lot
of weapons. We've got to expect more passes, from the left, where
he rolls out. He has a strong arm and the ability to get out to
run.''
</P>
<P>
   Linebacker Bryan Cox described the Jaguars as having ``a real
strong running game, a lot of balance, a real huge offensive line
that tries to enforce their will on you, tries to control the ball.
But they can open it up when they want to because they've got a
scrambling quarterback who's very dangerous. They all scramble,''
he said of Brunell and his back-up, Jonathan Quinn, a rookie. ``I
think it's something they teach.''
</P>
<P>
   When the Jets return to the practice field Tuesday, they will be
enjoying cold weather, and Parcells believes his team will do
better in it than almost any opponent it will face. The Jaguars
will have played in the Northeast only once in the last six weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, defensive lineman Ernie Logan, who played for the Jaguars
in 1995 and 1996, said: ``They're usually ready to play and to play
hard for 60 minutes. Coughlin does a good job of getting them
ready.''

REFILING TO FIX CODING 
BRITAIN KEEPS ITS DISTANCE AS THE EURO IS BORN 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: See also U.S.-EURO and the Outlook article 1999-EURO) 
(mk) 
 By ALAN COWELL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Holding back on the brink as it has at every turn
towards European integration, Britain observed the birth of the
euro single currency as a nation apart this weekend, its leaders
mute even as the banks that power the City of London financial
district prepared to trade the new money by the trillions.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Prime Minister Tony Blair, on vacation in the
Seychelles, nor Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown had
anything to say about the inception of the currency, from which
Britain has initially excluded itself, and which has been cast as
an event of momentous proportions for the 290 million people in the
11 countries participating in it.
</P>
<P>
   If there was a single, historical clue to Britain's reticence it
lay, perhaps, in lines penned almost 70 years ago by Winston
Churchill, which have defined Britain's ambiguity toward the great
land mass across the Channel ever since: ``We are with Europe, not
of it. We are linked but not comprised.''
</P>
<P>
   Britain is by far the most significant _ politically and
economically _ of the four countries outside the euro zone; the
others are Denmark, Sweden and Greece. It is arguably the only
major European power in which public debate about the euro has
flourished _ to such an extent that divisions over Europe provided
one of the many reasons for the defeat of the Conservatives in
1997.
</P>
<P>
   But it is no coincidence that the defining maxim should have
come from Churchill, Britain's wartime leader who rallied a
lonesome nation against the Nazi swamping of Europe in 1940. Then,
as now, in the euroskeptic view, Britain stands alone, its
sovereignty on the line. ``The classic argument'' among the
euro-skeptic newspapers that have driven the discussion, said Peter
Riddell, a newspaper columnist, ``is that it's Britain vs.
Germany'' _ Germany being depicted not just as the bulldozing power
behind the euro's creation, but also as the driving force of a
United States of Europe.
</P>
<P>
   And, as the euro became reality in global electronic trading
Sunday night, those opposed to the new currency raised alarms anew
that the currency is no more than a Trojan horse for a European
super-state in which the essence of British-ness would be lost.
``How can the government keep pretending that it is just about
currencies when the Continentals are clearly out to create a new
country and a new government?'' said John Redwood, a leading
euro-skeptic from the opposition Conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   For all that, no one in financial circles here seemed in the
least bit uncertain that, with such a vast euro market lapping at
its shores, Britain would really escape the tidal pull of the
currency. Even though Britain is outside the euro zone, London
provides Europe's biggest stock, bond and foreign exchange markets.
</P>
<P>
   Swapping pinstripes for blue-jeans, some 30,000 bankers and
back-room staff toiled over the weekend to prepare the trading
floors for an anticipated euro deluge when markets here open
Monday, turning 11 separate European currencies _ from the German
mark to the Spanish peseta _ into expressions of the euro and
converting a mass of financial data in what some depicted as a
less-than-thrilling exercise.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as excitement is concerned, it was a bit of a dud,''
said Rich Silverman, a spokesman for Merrill Lynch. ``You had the
sense that you were part of history. But not every part of history
is exciting.''
</P>
<P>
   The euro's penetration, however, is likely to run deep.
</P>
<P>
   Already, said Grant Phillips, head of the euro program at
Barclays Corporate Banking, some 30,000 British corporations, large
and small, have opened bank accounts in euros with his bank _
Britain's biggest _ alone. Indeed, some leading companies with
Continental business ties have let it be known that they will favor
suppliers who deal in euros, abandoning Britain's cherished pound
sterling. There is even talk of some companies offering euro
salaries to enable British employees to access cheaper mortgages at
the lower euro interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   With this ``creeping euro,'' Phillips said, ``we are fast
getting to the stage of the euro strolling _ if not galloping _
through the British economy.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Such arguments strengthen those who argue that, by abstaining
from the first wave of the euro, Britain is repeating its
historical mistake of denying the inevitable in Europe. ``The
tragedy,'' said the Observer Sunday newspaper in an editorial, ``is
that once again the British political and media establishment have
made sure Britain is not in a vital European project at the
beginning.''
</P>
<P>
   By this argument, Britain is missing out not just on
decision-making about the currency of its main trading area, but
also on a great opportunity for cheaper money in the
low-interest-rate euro zone and cheaper trade in a vast region free
of foreign exchange risks and costs. The counter-argument comes
back to the question of Britain's ability to steer its own economy,
manage its own interest rates and taxes, and preserve its own blend
of low unemployment, low taxes and relatively cheap labor.
</P>
<P>
   The euro, said Lord David Owen, a former Labor foreign
secretary, would mean far greater European ``involvement in tax,
even welfare, hours of work, working conditions.'' And, he said as
he launched a new anti-euro movement Sunday, ``essential parts'' of
British budget-making would ``now be decided in euroland'' _ the
term widely used for the 11 participating countries, which share
fixed common interest rates set by the European Central Bank in
Frankfurt.
</P>
<P>
   The European Central Bank, like most other European financial
institutions, said Sunday that its preparations for the euro had
been completed smoothly. The currency formally came into being on
Jan. 1. Since then, European markets have been closed and many
bankers say the real test of the conversion to the new currency
will come only when major European markets open Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Against all the hoopla surrounding the euro across the Channel,
it seemed typical of Britain's introversion that the main political
issues this weekend related not to the new currency but to
lingering brushfires over the resignation last month of Trade
Secretary Peter Mandelson _ and to a tussle over Blair's decision
to let his children defy government education policy and miss
classes at school this week while they complete their Indian Ocean
vacation.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, though, Blair's government is widely seen as being
friendlier to the euro than its Conservative predecessor, to the
extent, said Riddell, the newspaper columnist, that ``it's when
rather than if with Blair.'' The government's stated policy is to
postpone a decision until a referendum after the next general
election. Under Britain's electoral law, a national election need
not be held until the year 2002 _ a date by which the rest of
Europe will have completed the transition to using euro notes and
coins and much of British business will already be conducted in
euros.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the delay, Blair and his colleagues may be hoping for a
triumph of pragmatism over pride.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most obvious factor is whether the euro is a success,''
said Gerald Segal, director of the International Institute for
Strategic Studies here. ``If he is going to take Britain in, he
needs to be seen as going into a positive exercise.''
</P>
<P>
   But will the euro be a success? Andy Meadows is the curator of
an exhibit at the British Museum charting currency unions from
ancient Greek tridrachms through the silver denarii of the Roman
Empire and on to the euro. History, it turns out, reinforces the
mantra of the market-and-mirrors 1990s. ``If a coin is persuasive,
then people will accept it, and if people accept it, it becomes a
model,'' Meadows said in an interview. And if the marketplace needs
a common currency, ``then the market takes over'' _ euro-watchers,
please note.

<P>
   CALCUTTA, India _ In the Sonagachi red-light district, where
thousands of women sell their bodies along narrow, thronged lanes,
it is the prostitutes themselves who have become the leading
crusaders against AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   Like missionaries spreading the gospel, scores go forth each
morning from brothel to brothel, preaching to madams, pimps and
other prostitutes about the importance of using condoms, the most
effective shield against HIV infection.
</P>
<P>
   And they have done much more than talk. These women, despised
outcasts in Indian society, have organized more than half the
prostitutes of Sonagachi into a force with the influence to
challenge any pimp or madam who would insist on a customer's right
to sex without a condom. They call themselves a committee, but
operate as a kind of labor union for the world's oldest profession.
</P>
<P>
   Later this year, the Indian government will use the Sonagachi
project as its model in a large-scale battle against AIDS, waged
from red-light district to red-light district, across the vastness
of this country of almost a billion people.
</P>
<P>
   The hope is that if India acts swiftly, while the overall
infection rate is still relatively low, at less than 1 percent of
the total adult population, it can avoid the horrific burden of
death that afflicts Africa. Even now, because of its immense
population, India already has 4 million people estimated to be
infected with the virus.
</P>
<P>
   In a line of work that spawns cut-throat competition among
desperately poor women, and that regularly prompts prostitutes to
risk death by HIV infection for 50 cents per sex act, the Sonagachi
project has knit them together to fight for their rights and their
lives.
</P>
<P>
   Condom use in Sonagachi has soared, from 3 percent in 1992, when
the project began, to 90 percent in 1998. Researchers who have
conducted random sample surveys in Sonagachi have also found that
HIV infection rates among prostitutes here have been held to about
5 percent, a fraction of the more than 50 percent of prostitutes
infected in Bombay.
</P>
<P>
   Slowing the rate of infection among prostitutes and their
customers is essential to protecting the general population,
epidemiologists say. The truck drivers and migrant workers who go
to prostitutes are the same people who are carrying the disease
back to wives and lovers in villages all over the country.
</P>
<P>
   These days, when 30-year-old Pushpa Das, a prostitute in
Sonagachi, is confronted by a man who refuses to diminish his
pleasure by wearing a condom, she tells him to go away and knows
her madam will back her up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes I have to lose a customer, but I don't want to get
HIV,'' Mrs. Das said evenly. ``I just return the money.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Das cannot afford to die. Her husband is out of work. Her
$50 a month earnings keep hunger at bay for her 11-year-old
daughter, Asha, and her extended family. Before she became a
prostitute, she had been making $10 a month as a maid and her
family was down to one meal a day.
</P>
<P>
   The Sonagachi project pays 180 prostitutes about $1 a day each
to spread the word about AIDS and condoms. The British government,
long the colonial power in India, pays for the project and is one
of the largest foreign aid donors supporting health programs here.
This year the Indian government, with about $50 million in
financial backing from the World Bank, will begin using nonprofit
groups and government agencies in a nationwide effort to mobilize
prostitutes against the disease. The project in Sonagachi costs
only about $210,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The experience from other parts of the world and from
Sonagachi suggests that such efforts are the single most important
thing that can be done to try to control the epidemic,'' said
Prabat Jha, an epidemiologist at the World Bank who is team leader
for its AIDS project in India.
</P>
<P>
   One recent morning a group of prostitutes sat on the balcony of
their brothel overlooking a vibrant, clogged lane in Sonagachi. It
was too early for customers, so the women's faces were free of any
makeup. Over the jangling of hand-pulled carriages and the cries of
hawkers selling papayas, they spoke of the poverty that had driven
them into the sex trade.
</P>
<P>
   Milan Sarkar, a 21-year-old in a loose orange shift, was married
at 15 and abandoned by her husband at 16, with an infant son,
Anoop, to raise. There is no government safety net here, so a year
ago she went to Sonagachi. Her income now supports her parents, two
siblings and her 5-year-old son. Ms. Sarkar shields Anoop from the
knowledge of how she makes a living, telling him only that she has
to go to work while he stays with his grandparents.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Sarkar said she refuses to have sex without a condom, but
some drunken men force themselves on her, while others tear the
condoms with their nails so they will peel off during sex.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very frightened about AIDS,'' she said. ``My son and my
whole family depend on me. My father is old and won't be able to
continue working. I have to live here for them. And it is a
terrible pressure.''
</P>
<P>
   The prostitutes who work in the project have used a combination
of sweet talk and occasional arm-twisting to persuade madams about
condom usage. Delegations of prostitutes, wearing distinctive green
medical jackets over their saris, visit madams and tell them, ``If
you are to enjoy the fruits of the tree, you must keep the tree
healthy.''
</P>
<P>
   Gita Das, a 50-year-old madam, manages five prostitutes who
commute to Sonagachi daily to work in two small, dingy rooms. Mrs.
Das, who wears a bindi, the red dot on a woman's forehead that
signifies her status as a married woman, inherited the role of
madam from her mother-in-law 25 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   She has become a convert to condoms out of her own
self-interest. ``I argue with the customers, `You should use
condoms,''' she said. ``If they refuse I send them away. If the
girls use condoms and stay healthy, that helps keep them loyal to
me.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Not every expert is sure the Sonagachi approach will work
outside the state of West Bengal. Calcutta, its capital, has
India's strongest tradition of labor unionism, an inspiration for
the Sonagachi project. In contrast, Bombay, the epicenter of the
epidemic, has a brutal and powerful mafia that runs the sex trade.
Gangsters are likely to resist efforts to organize prostitutes.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, even the skeptics agree that India must act. ``If
you don't try to take these efforts to scale, you'll have little
wonderful corners, but you won't address the big issues that India
poses by its sheer size,'' said Gordon Alexander, who heads the
U.N. AIDS program in India.
</P>
<P>
   This nation is only now awakening to the dangers the epidemic
poses. Last month, for the first time, an Indian prime minister
spoke publicly and at length about the disease. Prime Minister Atal
Behari Vajpayee declared HIV and AIDS to be the country's most
serious public health challenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``When HIV appeared in India in 1986, everybody thought that it
is a Western disease that will be contracted only by sex workers in
red-light areas, gay men and injecting drug users,'' Vajpayee said.
``The consequences of that myopic view are now upon us.''
</P>
<P>
   The first prostitutes who ventured into Sonagachi and other
red-light districts in Calcutta to talk about the prevention of
AIDS were chased off with brooms, drenched with buckets of water
and spat on. Prostitutes and madams feared that an insistence on
condoms would drive customers away.
</P>
<P>
   Sadhana Mukherjee, 40, remembers hoodlums threatening to strip
her naked, beat her up and throw her out of the red-light district
unless she stopped proselytizing for condoms. But she and her
supervisor politely explained their strategy: If the district
became known for AIDS, that would really drive customers away. They
were not trying to destroy the sex trade, only to insure the health
of prostitutes.
</P>
<P>
   Like many of the other prostitutes working in the project, Ms.
Mukherjee keenly felt the sting of society's contempt, but she was
proud that she had survived by her wits.
</P>
<P>
   When she was 12 her family was duped into giving her up to a
woman who promised to find her work in a plastics factory in
Calcutta. Instead, Ms. Mukherjee said, the woman sold her to a
brothel for $10.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was beaten on the cheeks, tugged by my hair, forced to drink
alcohol, strangled so I couldn't swallow for two weeks,'' she said.
``The rage I felt about being tortured so mercilessly has burned
within me from the first day.''
</P>
<P>
   It is those memories of her first terrible years in the sex
trade that have made her a passionate and untiring worker for the
rights of prostitutes in Sonagachi.
</P>
<P>
   And the respect with which she and the other prostitutes have
been treated in the project has strengthened their bond. They all
speak with affection of Smarajit Jana, the slight, mustachioed
epidemiologist who was assigned to run the Sonagachi project by the
nation's All India Institute of Hygiene and Public Health, part of
the Indian government's ministry of health.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's like a father and a mother to us,'' said Minu Adhikari,
one of the first prostitutes hired by the project. ``We were
stigmatized by everyone around us. He showered us with love and
affection.''
</P>
<P>
   Jana said he quickly realized that reaching the prostitutes
would require much more than a narrow focus on AIDS. In his first
week on the job, the courteous but rather formal researcher visited
a brothel. He was introduced, he said, as ``the big doctor from the
big hospital,'' and found the prostitutes reluctant to talk.
</P>
<P>
   But by the third day, they began asking him for medical advice.
To his astonishment, the first nine women wanted help with
infertility problems, common among prostitutes who have had
repeated bouts of sexually transmitted diseases.
</P>
<P>
   ``That opened my eyes,'' he said. ``They're like any other
women. They want a child. They have the same heart, the same minds
and feelings.''
</P>
<P>
   The health clinic that opened in Sonagachi to treat syphilis and
gonorrhea wound up treating women and children. It was the first
time most prostitutes had an alternative to quack doctors who
practice in the red-light district.
</P>
<P>
   Just a year and a half after the project began, the percentage
of prostitutes who said they used condoms had risen from almost
nothing to 70 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Something less tangible had also begun to happen. The
prostitutes hired by the project were turning into a force to be
reckoned with in the power structure of the red-light district _ a
place where madams, pimps, hoodlums, money lenders and quacks once
reigned supreme.
</P>
<P>
   The literate prostitutes in the project began teaching the
others to read in makeshift daily classes held on plastic sheeting
spread on the bare ground in the clinic's courtyard _ classes that
continue even now.
</P>
<P>
   By 1994 they began demanding things that went way beyond the
project's mandate. They wanted police protection from hoodlums.
They wanted police raids to stop. They wanted a place to borrow
money at fair rates.
</P>
<P>
   Jana said he also realized that the prostitutes needed more than
information and condoms to prevent the spread of HIV.
</P>
<P>
   ``They must enforce condom use by the clients, for which they
need skill, confidence and power,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   With his encouragement, the prostitutes organized the Women's
Collaborative Committee in 1995. The committee now has about 30,000
members in West Bengal, each paying dues of about 50 cents a year.
</P>
<P>
   They have since formed their own financial cooperative to escape
the clutches of money lenders who charge interest rates of at least
1,000 percent a year. To do so, committee members persuaded the
state government to dissolve a requirement that members of a
cooperative have legal standing as people of ``good moral
character.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of prostitutes have repeatedly encircled police
stations to demand action against criminals. In one case, men who
had tortured two prostitutes with blades and cigarette butts had
gone unpunished. After the prostitutes held their noisy protest,
police arrested the men and beat them up, the gratified prostitutes
said.
</P>
<P>
   The women have also intervened to rescue child prostitutes sold
or duped into the trade. The committee members' motives are
altruistic yet self-interested. The under-age girls are tough
competition in a market that prizes youth, and they also attract
police raids that disrupt business.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, on a routine visit to a brothel, Ms. Adhikari, one of
the prostitutes working in the project, said she discovered a
13-year-old girl from Bangladesh who had been sold to a madam. Ms.
Adhikari said she simply walked out with the girl and the committee
later returned her to her family.
</P>
<P>
   ``The committee explains to the madam that this is not done,''
Ms. Adhikari said. ``She doesn't have the muscle to fight us. We're
too big for her. She can't go to the police. And now that we're so
organized, she can't go to the hoodlums either.''
</P>
<P>
   The percentage of prostitutes 19 or younger in Sonagachi dropped
from about one in five in 1995 to about one in 30 in 1998,
according to project surveys.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years the project has expanded beyond the confines of
Sonagachi, home to about 6,000 prostitutes, into other red-light
districts in Calcutta and nearby areas, where about 21,000
prostitutes work. It employs 180 prostitutes and 100 other workers
and operates 12 health clinics.
</P>
<P>
   The government's All India Institute of Hygiene and Public
Health runs the project in collaboration with three nonprofit
groups and the prostitutes' committee.
</P>
<P>
   They have managed to do the work at low cost. The main office is
a windowless basement. The project has cut back on distribution of
free condoms and sells many of them through the cooperative at bulk
rates. The staff is paid very little by Western standards.
Medicines in India are inexpensive.
</P>
<P>
   Bharati Dey, a 38-year-old prostitute, joined the project in
1997 to work in Talpukur, a red-light district in a northern
suburb. She recently visited a defiant madam who refused to require
customers visiting her brothel to wear a condom.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Dey said she took the nine prostitutes in the brothel aside
and suggested they disappear for a few days. ``Less than an hour
after they left, the madam gave in,'' Ms. Dey said. ``But they did
not return for three days.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a message of strength that quickly spread to other
madams.
</P>
<P>
   Jana and the prostitutes who work in the Sonagachi project will
soon become missionaries far beyond the confines of Calcutta. Jana,
45, will leave his post in Sonagachi and plans to advise the Indian
government in its efforts to expand the model nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   J.V.R. Prasada Rao, director of India's National AIDS Control
Organization, said he would tap the expertise of the prostitutes,
as well as that of Jana. ``We're going to take the Sonagachi girls
to Bombay and ask them to talk to the madams and sex workers,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Bombay is ground zero for AIDS in India. Almost half the people
infected with the HIV virus live in the state of Maharastra and its
capital, Bombay. And rates of HIV infection among prostitutes in
its sprawling sex industry are already very high.
</P>
<P>
   The prostitutes in Bombay are powerless, not only against the
disease, but against the gangsters who run the trade. There are
several small programs there that employ prostitutes to spread the
word about condoms and that provide prostitutes with health care,
but none of them have attempted to organize the women.
</P>
<P>
   The difference in the moods of the red-light districts of
Calcutta and Bombay can be sensed immediately. In Calcutta, many
prostitutes talk openly in front of their madams. In Bombay, they
speak quietly, glancing furtively over their shoulders to make sure
no one hears.
</P>
<P>
   In Calcutta, many of the prostitutes wear decorous saris in
muted colors and look a lot like office workers waiting impassively
at a bus stop.
</P>
<P>
   In Bombay, they are tarted up in shiny red lip gloss,
midriff-bearing halters, skin-tight velvet pants and gaudy saris.
They pose aggressively and their faces are set in a sulky come-on.
They stand in the lurid light of Falkland Road like Broadway
actresses on a gritty stage. Unprotected from HIV, they are
tempting death to come knocking.

PRESSURED MCNABB MISSES THE MARK IN FINAL COLLEGE GAME
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By CHARLIE NOBLES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service

</P>
<P>
   MIAMI _ Donovan McNabb was among the last to leave the Syracuse
locker room early Sunday morning. He emerged wearing an olive suit
and white shoes and feeling some heartache beneath his ever-present
smile.
</P>
<P>
   McNabb, the option quarterback who accounted for more than
10,000 yards running and passing in his career, had spent time
trading hugs and handshakes with the 11 other Syracuse seniors
whose last game became a nightmarish 31-10 loss to Florida in the
Orange Bowl on Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're upset about the loss,'' McNabb said. ``But mainly we're
upset about leaving. Hopefully we'll stay in touch, but it's not
going to be the same.''
</P>
<P>
   McNabb had said he wanted the Orange Bowl to be his best game,
so it could serve as a springboard for Syracuse (8-4) next season.
It was anything but. He threw for 192 yards, but completed only 14
of his 30 passes, lost two of the team's three fumbles and threw an
interception. He rushed for 72 yards on 20 carries. Florida shut
down an Orangemen offense that was averaging 42.5 points a game.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was off his mark,'' Syracuse offensive coordinator Kevin
Rogers said. ``Passes he usually completes in his sleep were
one-hoppers.''
</P>
<P>
   Rogers noted, however, that Florida put more pressure on McNabb
than any other team this season, or probably any season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think you're going to find out three or four years from now
that they probably have 10 or 11 guys on that defense playing in
the National Football League,'' Rogers said.
</P>
<P>
   Florida, which finished 10-2 and became the first Southeastern
Conference school to win at least 10 games for six consecutive
seasons, sprinted to an early 14-0 lead that grew to 28-3 by
halftime.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very emotional in different parts of the game,'' McNabb
said. ``Especially in the third quarter when we were down 28-3. We
weren't playing like Syracuse. With all the firepower we have, we
should have been doing more, and that was really upsetting. It's
unfortunate it had to happen in a bowl game, but we have to move
on.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, with a fizzle instead of a pop, the McNabb era at Syracuse
is over. He was named the Big East Conference offensive player of
the year the last three seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sad right now for a lot of reasons,'' the senior defensive
end Marc Pilon said. ``One thing I think about is you're never
going to play with a Donovan McNabb again.''
</P>
<P>
   Paul Pasqualoni, the Syracuse coach, said: ``We wish Donovan
McNabb the absolute best. He's a great kid and great competitor. I
think Donovan will go down as one of the outstanding players we've
had.''
</P>
<P>
   McNabb said it was difficult to put his Syracuse years in
perspective in the hot glare of defeat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mainly what I'll remember is the close friendships I've made,
friendships I'll have for the rest of my life,'' he said. ``It's
going to be hard sitting back on Saturdays and watching a team I
was a part of for five years.''
</P>
<P>
   To the Syracuse fans, who embraced him with such fervor, he
said: ``I just want to thank them for welcoming me with open arms.
Since I was a freshman, the crowd's been there giving me love and
warmth _ their hearts were there and I just tried to provide
nothing but the best for them.''
</P>
<P>
   McNabb's likely heir at quarterback is Madei Williams, a
redshirt freshman from Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has a strong arm and he's very intelligent and he has a lot
of fun,'' McNabb said. ``That's one of the main things I stressed
with him, just having fun. If you're relaxed and have your mind on
what you should be focusing on, good things will go your way. Madei
is a guy who works hard and competes, and I think he'll do well.''
</P>
<P>
   Then McNabb smiled again, turned and walked into the night.

(ATTN: OHIO, CALIFORNIA ) PHILHARMONIC VIOLINIST STEPS FORTH AS A
SOLOIST 
 (DW)
</HEADLINE>
  By ANTHONY TOMMASINI  
c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In September, Sheryl Staples, a violinist originally
from Los Angeles, was appointed principal associate concertmaster
of the New York Philharmonic. Previously she had been associate
concertmaster with the Cleveland Orchestra, a post she earned when
she was just 26.
</P>
<P>
   Like many instrumentalists in major orchestras today, Ms.
Staples has also pursued a solo career, having played concertos
with some 40 orchestras nationwide. On Saturday afternoon she added
the Philharmonic to the list, when she was the soloist in
Tchaikovsky's Violin Concerto, with Kurt Masur conducting, at Avery
Fisher Hall. Her impressive performance said much about the current
high level of competition for jobs with major orchestras and the
depth of talent within their ranks.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Staples is a technically assured violinist, and little in
this dauntingly virtuoso work posed problems for her. She is a
perceptive musician, who plays with great rhythmic integrity and a
lucid sense of phrase structure. Her remarkable instrument is a
rich-toned Guarnerius from about 1720, which is on loan to her from
the Mandell Collection in Southern California, and she draws a
wonderful array of vibrant and luminous colors from it.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps for some listeners, Ms. Staples' playing lacks that
charismatic, slightly neurotic quality that turns a fine performer
into a star. But I found her interpretive honesty and unmannered
elegance refreshing and, in its understated way, exciting. Indeed,
the audience broke into enthusiastic applause even after the first
movement.
</P>
<P>
   A little glitch in the finale, when Ms. Staples dropped some
notes in a fearsome passage, probably bothered her more than us.
This was a most rewarding performance. The Philharmonic clearly has
a strong new musician in a crucial position.
</P>
<P>
   The program also included a performance of Tchaikovsky's
Symphony No. 6, the ``Pathetique,'' which was dedicated by Masur to
the memory of Judith Arron, the artistic and executive director of
Carnegie Hall, who died last month at 56. The orchestra played
splendidly, though Masur drove the third movement, a blazing march,
unrelentingly.
</P>
<P>
   Consequently, it took some time for the final movement, the
grieving Adagio Lamentoso, to settle down. But over all the
performance was bold and affecting, a fitting memorial to an
important cultural figure in New York.
</P>

   They were just a couple of confident young men from Columbia
University. Their names were Richard Rodgers and Lorenz Hart.
</P>
<P>
   From ``The Garrick Gaieties'' in 1925 to ``Pal Joey'' in 1940,
the composer Rodgers (1902-1979) and the lyricist Hart (1895-1943)
were the toast of Broadway. Beginning at 8 p.m. Wednesday, PBS'
``Great Performances'' will offer a reprise of their partnership
called ``The Rodgers and Hart Story: Thou Swell, Thou Witty.''
Produced and directed by David Thompson, the man behind the series'
profiles of Busby Berkeley and Arthur Freed, the one-hour show
features performers like Christine Ebersole, Rebecca Luker and Jane
Krakowski and songs like ``Falling in Love With Love,'' ``The Lady
Is a Tramp'' and ``My Funny Valentine.''
</P>
<P>
   Evening's Work
</P>
<P>
   Music in the grand Venetian tradition arrives at the National
Cathedral in Washington at 8 p.m. Friday and 7:30 p.m. Saturday,
when the Folger Consort offers Monteverdi's ``1610 Vespers,'' a
choral work regarded as a monument of the Baroque. Said to be the
first complete performances in Washington in more than a decade,
these will highlight vocal and instrumental soloists. Joining
Robert Eisenstein and Christopher Kendall, the artistic directors
and founding members of the Consort, will be 10 soloists, the
Boston Shawm and Sackbut Ensemble and a period-instrument orchestra
led by Ryan Brown. Information: (202) 544-7077.
</P>
<P>
   Stepping Forward
</P>
<P>
   On dancing feet set in motion by the artistry of five
choreographers, a new year of Altogether Different begins at 8 p.m.
Monday at the Joyce Theater. This segment of the series, created in
1986 to present talents in the process of developing and expanding
their companies and audiences, runs through Jan. 17. Each of the
five choreographers will give three performances. In order of
appearance, they are Sean Curran, Kevin Wynn, Lisa Giobbi, Sally
Silvers and H.T. Chen. Information: (212) 242-0800.
</P>
<P>
   Who's Counting?
</P>
<P>
   Chances to observe the 100th anniversary of the birth of Francis
Poulenc, hear his music and renew acquaintance with Babar the
Elephant in the company of the actor Tony Randall coincide at 7
p.m. Thursday, courtesy of the New York Library for the Performing
Arts. In celebration of the centenary of the French composer
(1899-1963), the library's ``Principally Poulenc'' series will
present a program at the Great Hall at Cooper Union, where the
pianist Grant Johannesen, a leading Poulenc interpreter, and
Randall will perform Poulenc's ``Histoire de Babar,'' an evocative
setting of Jean de Brunhoff's beloved tale. Besides this work for
narrator and pianist, the program includes Poulenc's ``Animaux
Modeles,'' based on La Fontaine's fables, and ``Suite Francaise.''

   NY-CANCER-COMPETE (New York) _ Cancer is hot in New York, and,
across the city, the major medical centers are aggressively
attempting to nibble away at Memorial Sloan-Kettering's market
share. (Sloan-Kettering was always the place to go for cancer
treatment in New York, because of its prestigious doctors, esteemed
reputation for clinical research and the promising drugs trials it
conducts.) While the concentration on cancer is a nationwide
phenomenon, experts say the new competition is particularly fevered
in New York, where there are already more centers that have the
official designation of the National Cancer Institute _ and its
funding _ than in most other regions.

   IMPEACH-ASSESS (Washington) _ Since nobody except perhaps Rep.
Tom DeLay of Texas, the House majority whip, appears to believe
that the Senate might really vote to convict Clinton and remove him
from office, the argument goes, why not get it over with quickly?
Some quick resolution, including a censure, seems to be the goal
Trent Lott and Tom Daschle, the Senate leaders, are pursuing with
many other senators. But there is a case for a trial. It is heard
most often from the President's critics in Congress who insist that
when the Constitution says, ``The Senate shall have the sole power
to try all impeachments,'' it offers no discretion. By Adam Clymer.

HOSPITALS BATTLE OVER LUCRATIVE CANCER-CARE MARKET 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Fla.)  (js) 
 By JENNIFER STEINHAUER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The vast prestige, power and, critics would argue,
arrogance of Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center can be measured
by its physical space.
</P>
<P>
   It is on York Avenue on the Upper East Side and, like many
prestigious New York City hospitals, inconvenient to public
transportation. Many of its hospital floors feel grim and dated,
with harsh lighting and nurses' stations enclosed in Plexiglass.
Its parking lot is dismal, and some waiting areas are about as
welcoming as the average public hospital's.
</P>
<P>
   Historically, Sloan-Kettering has been the place to go for
cancer treatment in New York because of its prestigious doctors,
esteemed reputation for clinical research and the promising drugs
trials it conducts. Ambiance has never been the point.
</P>
<P>
   But lately, curious things have been happening at
Sloan-Kettering. It is building a new ambulatory care center at
53rd Street and Third Avenue, smack next to several subway lines.
The main hospital is undergoing a face lift: peach-toned walls with
still-life paintings are relacing blinding white ones,
sand-colored carpeting is being added and nurses' stations are now
open and accessible. In recent years it also opened a modern,
attractive center for breast cancer patients on East 64th Street,
complete with comfortable furniture and a shop that sells hats,
scarves, jewelry and the like.
</P>
<P>
   And last week, Sloan-Kettering's 72-year-old president, Paul A.
Marks, said he would retire next year, perhaps paving the way for
further changes in the center's way of doing business, which has
nearly ignored the managed-care movement.
</P>
<P>
   This is hardly enlightenment in a vacuum. Cancer is hot in New
York, and across the city the major medical centers are
aggressively attempting to nibble away at Sloan-Kettering's market
share. While this concentration on cancer patients is a nationwide
phenomenon, experts say the new competition is particularly fevered
in New York, where there are already more centers that have the
official designation of the National Cancer Institute _ and its
funding _ than in most other regions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, New York is the hotbed of competition,'' said
Christopher Demby, who runs the Oncology Round Table program for
the Advisory Board, a health care research firm. ``There is action
being taken by every player in the market now.''
</P>
<P>
   Hospitals are building new centers devoted to the disease and
poaching some of the country's biggest names in cancer care _ some
from Sloan-Kettering itself _ to run and staff them. They are
investing in expensive technology, adding all manner of
consumer-friendly fringe benefits like support groups and libraries
to their cancer wards and pouring money into advertising campaigns
that hawk cancer treatments in a way once reserved for innovations
like birthing centers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are here to show that Memorial is no longer the only game
in town,'' said Marilyn Halper, executive director of Beth Israel
Medical Center's gleaming new cancer center, in the Zeckendorf
Tower on Union Square _ a public transport hub for lower Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Carving off one disease and homing in on it is an important
trend in medicine, especially chronic diseases that require
long-term care. Diabetes, for instance, is also getting lots of
attention. But few illnesses have attracted quite the same focus
and investment as cancer.
</P>
<P>
   The reason is largely financial: Cancer is big business. The
increasing numbers of new cases alone make cancer an essential part
of any hospital's business. Experts believe that cancer will soon
overtake cardiovascular disease as the No. 1 killer in America as
the population ages and cardio-care becomes more advanced.
</P>
<P>
   Cancer offers other financial incentives beyond the sheer flow
of cases: The disease is still fairly immune from managed care
penny pinching, while treatment advances have helped to streamline
care. And there is constant excitement in the field: More than 300
cancer drugs are in the pipeline.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the activity involves the opening of outpatient clinics,
which are starting to flourish across the country as new
technologies and changing medical economics allow patients to have
chemotherapy and radiation treatments without staying overnight in
a hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Continuum Health Partners, which runs Beth Israel and St.
Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center, built the new Union Square
out-patient center and beefed up its breast cancer program at St.
Luke's. It has poached several doctors from other far-more
prestigious cancer centers to run many of its programs, and spent
over $400,000 last year on cancer advertising campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   Over at New York University, the medical center has carved off
neuro-oncology as its brightest attraction, investing $10 million
alone in a rare Gamma knife that administers beams of gamma
radiation without surgical incision to the brain, and $2.5 million
more on special MRI machines, which enable doctors to rule out
malignancies without a biopsy. It also lured Dr. Michael Gruber, a
prestigious neuro-oncologist from the University of California in
Los Angeles, to run the unit.
</P>
<P>
   St. Vincent's Hospital, which had almost no profile as a cancer
treatment center, has hired an outside company to build its cancer
clinic. Mount Sinai Medical Center in Manhattan and Montefiore
Medical Center in the Bronx have made similar deals with Dr.
Bernard Salick, the California physician-entrepreneur whose
24-hour-for-profit cancer clinics have raised the customer-service
bar.
</P>
<P>
   Importantly, all of these hospitals and their doctors are well
versed in the ways of managed care, and are in a position to take
the increasing load of patients who are enrolled in HMOs and can
only afford to go to centers that honor them. Sloan-Kettering has
all but shunned the managed care movement, which also can cost a
hospital important drug trial money. ``In order to have enough
patients to do these trials you need a cross section of patients,''
said Joann Schellenbach, a spokeswoman for the American Cancer
Society. ``Not just those who can afford to go to elite
physicians.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   It is almost impossible to track the cancer business market
share _ most of the hospitals guard their numbers more closely than
any privately held company, and many experts think that New York
City's community hospitals are simply getting slices of a growing
market rather than stealing business from Sloan-Kettering.
</P>
<P>
   But since 1996, when Beth Israel opened its Union Square center,
the number of patients seen there has risen to 21,174 from 15,027.
Further, the hospital's in-patient cancer business has grown 12
percent since 1992.
</P>
<P>
   At NYU, new-case growth is similar. In 1993, its department of
neuro-oncology saw five patients. In 1997, that number grew to 275.
And if Salick's success in California is any indication, new cases
at hospitals where he is affiliated should certainly swell this
year.
</P>
<P>
   Salick, whose mere name tends to raise hackles in more
traditional circles, can be credited with helping to push New
York's medical centers toward a greater emphasis on
patient-friendly cancer care.
</P>
<P>
   He began opening for-profit centers in 1986 in California and
expanded to Florida. He says his niche is the 24-hour comprehensive
service that patients can get in his centers, and that his deep
knowledge of managed care, prevalent in California for a decade but
still fairly new to this area, gives him an edge. He also provides
the financing, badly needed by hospitals with dwindling resources,
to get clinics off the ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a highly credible reputation of running very cost
effective facilities,'' Salick said in an interview. ``You have
wonderful hospitals and wonderful doctors in New York but there is
a breakdown in the delivery system. You go to these places at 9 at
night and no one is there. Cancer is a disease that happens to go
on 24 hours a day. All these other hospitals are doing is opening a
center and sticking some doctors in there.''
</P>
<P>
   Some cancer experts have expressed concerns about Salick's
for-profit model, arguing that health care surpluses should go back
into the hospitals that generate them, not in shareholder's
pockets. Others deride his approach as either impractical or
non-threatening. ``Not too many people want radiation at 4 a.m.,''
said Dr. Warren Enker, the associate director of Beth Israel and
St. Luke's cancer center. ``So it's not that great a gimmick.''
</P>
<P>
   But Enker's colleague, Ms. Halper, admits that Salick has
underscored the importance of focusing on customer service. ``The
for-profits have taught us the importance of being
patient-friendly,'' she said. ``This is a service.'' A wig shop,
wooden furniture designed in Vermont and a light-soaked atrium of a
lobby are all part of Beth Israel's efforts in that regard.
</P>
<P>
   And patient friendliness has traditionally been the Achilles
heel of Sloan-Kettering's reputation. Doctors who have worked at
the hospital and some patients who have received care there
describe an imperious and at times cold atmosphere, where waits can
be long and doctors hard to reach.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, warmth wins over clinical reputation. Michael
Berkowitz learned he had lung cancer in 1996. His wife was
pregnant, his life as a successful Wall Street lawyer was thrown
into turmoil and he had to make some decisions about treatment,
fast. First, he went to Beth Israel, then to Sloan-Kettering for a
second opinion. He decided to go with Beth Israel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone says to be cured, you have to go to Sloan because
they have the reputation,'' he said. While he was impressed with
the doctors, he found the hospital to be ``a scary and
institutional place,'' he said. ``It feels big, and you feel small.
I felt that I did not have the same personal connection as I did to
the Beth Israel doctors.''
</P>
<P>
   Some former Sloan-Kettering physicians say a lack of warmth
toward patients was an unfortunate byproduct of working in a highly
elite institution. ``Sloan-Kettering is one of the institutions
that has an exceedingly cumbersome administration,'' said Enker,
who left in 1995 for Beth Israel.
</P>
<P>
   ``The surgeons there are very dedicated to their patients,''
Enker added. ``But it is a very busy environment. You can't see
hundreds of patients each year and not have patients feel rushed.
And I hear repeated complaints that the medical oncologists are
lacking in compassion and part of the arrogance becomes `Look I am
the expert, you came to me for my opinion so listen to me or you're
dismissed.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Sloan-Kettering doctors and administrators are not unaware of
their reputation. But they also argue that it is more myth than
reality. ``There is a misperception that we are an ivory tower,''
said Dr. James B. Dougherty, deputy physician in chief of clinical
affairs at Sloan-Kettering. ``This is a very patient-centered
environment.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Dougherty and his colleagues have made
customer-friendly cancer care a focus in recent years, even
studying the hospitality industry for clues, and have adopted
things like a more room-service style approach to patient meals as
a result. Getting patients out of the hospital and into its new
200,000-square-foot out-patient center on 53rd Street, where care
will be more streamlined, is a goal.
</P>
<P>
   Just as universities and corporations go after big names to
attract new business, so do medical centers. Cancer is no
exception. In the last few years, Sloan-Kettering has lost several
doctors to various centers, including four to Beth Israel alone.
St. Luke's poached Dr. Alison Estabrook, now head of its breast
center, from Columbia Presbyterian. In addition to Gruber, NYU
recently recruited Dr. Patrick Kelly from the Mayo Clinic and
several prominent doctors from other states. In turn, Beth Israel
took three doctors from NYU.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best way to go after patients is through building your
talent base,'' said Uwe Reinhardt, a health economist at Princeton
University. What is more, they attract drug companies and other
institutions needed to get drug trials going, which are another
major attraction for critically ill patients.
</P>
<P>
   Sloan-Kettering is not just content to spiff up its New York
City hospital. It is encroaching on the cancer business of some
regional hospitals by opening satellite centers elsewhere that
enable patients to get things like chemo and radiation without
having the trek into Manhattan. There is one in Long Island, two in
New Jersey and one in the suburbs just north of New York City, and
plans for more, Dougherty said.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, hospitals in Long Island are not cheering. ``There is
considerable concern in Suffolk County over Sloan-Kettering's
plans,'' said Demby of the oncology round table. ``And what that
will mean to local facilities.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the cancer war promises to expand outside the immediate
region, experts say. ``Cancer is to the 1990s what heart disease
was to the 1970s,'' said Gruber of NYU. ``It puts a center on the
map, and that begets business.''

ISRAELI POLICE ARREST CHRISTIAN CULTISTS PLANNING MILLENNIUM
SUICIDE
</HEADLINE>
   (Attn: Colo., Ohio, Mass.) 
(DW) 
 By DEBORAH SONTAG   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Israeli police officials Sunday arrested eight
American members of a Denver-based apocalyptic cult who the
officials said were planning to mark the millennium by committing
suicide or provoking their own killings in the streets of
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   The police said the eight belonged to the Concerned Christians
cult, whose members disappeared early last fall, emptying out their
houses and leaving Colorado without a trace. The cult members
planned to destroy themselves shortly before the millennium in
order to hasten the Second Coming of Christ, the police officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They planned to carry out violent and extreme acts in the
streets of Jerusalem at the end of 1999 to start the process of
bringing Jesus back to life,'' said Brig. Gen. Elihu Ben-Onn, an
Israeli police general.
</P>
<P>
   The cultists specifically wanted to create a catastrophic event
by provoking a deadly shootout with the police in the Old City,
where by Christian tradition the tomb of Jesus lies, in the Church
of the Holy Sepulcher, a police official said.
</P>
<P>
   Their leader, Monte Kim Miller, a former marketing executive for
Procter &AMP; Gamble who claimed he could speak in the voice of God,
had predicted that he would die in Jerusalem in 1999. But he was
not among those arrested and the authorities here do not believe he
is in Israel.
</P>
<P>
   The eight were to be brought before a judge within 24 hours, but
the Israelis plan to deport them rather than to prosecute them.
They also intend to track down what they say may be dozens more
cult members who have eluded the police.
</P>
<P>
   Brig. Gen. Hezi Leder, the police attache at the Israeli Embassy
in Washington, said of the arrests, ``There probably will be
more.''
</P>
<P>
   Israeli police officials fear that this may be the beginning of
a wave of apocalypse-seekers who could descend on Jerusalem in
advance of the millennium. Already, dozens of American Christians
have settled here in anticipation of the year 2000. Some of them
have rented rooms at the base of the Mount of Olives, to secure
what they hope will be a bird's-eye view of Christ's reappearance
at the spot where the Gospels recorded an apocalyptic vision of the
future.
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli authorities are courting Christian pilgrims to
celebrate the millennium here, but some experts on the millennium
have warned them that they could be playing with fire. Many insist,
though, that the potentially dangerous groups will be a minority.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't say there are not fundamentalists or extremists, but
it's all out of proportion to think only of them,'' said Uri Mor,
the deputy director of the Religious Affairs Ministry, who oversees
relations with the Christian communities here. ``Of course, you
have to take care, but in proportion.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the police made it clear that with these arrests they
were drawing a line in the sand.
</P>
<P>
   ``The police will continue to work in every legal way possible
to allow for freedom of religion and ritual in Jerusalem and in
Israel for all religions in the years of the millennium,'' said
Gen. Yair Yitzrak, chief commander of the Jerusalem Police
District. ``However, we will act firmly against the attempts of
extreme groups to block access to other Christians in the year
1999.''
</P>
<P>
   In Colorado, relatives of the cult members said they had
expected the arrests.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew they were going to deport them a couple of weeks
ago,'' said John Weaver of Lakewood, Colo., whose daughter used to
be a member of the group. ``Israel is trying to set an example that
they don't want these millennial groups.''
</P>
<P>
   Late Sunday afternoon, the police, together with Shin Bet
security agents, took the eight adults, together with six children,
into custody after a raid on two suburban-style homes in the
western outskirts of the city.
</P>
<P>
   The members, whom they did not identify, had been living quietly
in two relatively affluent neighborhoods, surviving on their
savings and on donations from abroad, said police officials, who
are working in conjunction with the American authorities.
</P>

A FRUSTRATED BRUNELL LIFTS JAGUARS PAST PATRIOTS
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By MIKE FREEMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JACKSONVILLE, Fla. _ The Jaguars' quarterback, Mark Brunell,
despite being ahead of the New England Patriots by 12 points late
in the first half Sunday, seemed extremely agitated. He screamed at
the head coach. Once, after he was sacked, Brunell slammed the
football to the turf. The Pro Bowl quarterback was frustrated by
his play, since he wasn't sharp after a month-long layoff with a
severe ankle sprain. But Brunell was angry about something else _
he knew the Jaguars should have been winning by 30 points.
</P>
<P>
   New England played as badly as it could early, but Jacksonville
managed only a 12-0 halftime lead. Suddenly, in the third quarter,
the Patriots woke up. Instead of a clumsy offense that at one point
went 0 for 7 on third-down conversions, the Patriots suddenly
became sharp during a 17-play, 85-yard touchdown drive. Instead of
quarterback Scott Zolak playing as if he were allergic to the end
zone, he suddenly got into a zone.
</P>
<P>
   But rather than letting the game _ and the season _ slip away,
the Jaguars finally took the game by the throat. A touchdown catch
by Pro Bowl wide receiver Jimmy Smith and a late turnover by New
England sealed Jacksonville's 25-10 playoff victory before a crowd
of 71,139 at Alltel Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The Jaguars advanced to the second round of the American
Football Conference playoffs and will play the Jets next Sunday in
Giants Stadium. The story line all week will be about Jacksonville
Coach Tom Coughlin going against his close friend and mentor, Bill
Parcells, a subject that did not make Coughlin exactly misty-eyed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can I enjoy this win before we start talking about that . .
.?'' Coughlin said.
</P>
<P>
   But Coughlin did talk about how proud he was of his team, since
the Jaguars this season won their first AFC Central Division title,
as well as 11 regular-season games to become the National Football
League's first expansion team to qualify for the playoffs three
times in its first four seasons.
</P>
<P>
   But if the Jaguars are going to get back to another conference
title game by beating the favored Jets, then Brunell must simply
play better. Clearly, Brunell's high ankle sprain is limiting what
he and the Jacksonville offense can do best. Bootlegs and
sprintouts, a Brunell staple, are simply not options now.
</P>
<P>
   He completed only 14 of 34 passes for 161 yards, and the offense
stalled in the second and third quarters as the pain increased,
because as Brunell goes, so goes the Jacksonville offense.
Brunell's ankle became so bothersome, that he and Coughlin had a
discussion about whether or not Brunell should take himself out of
the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I twisted the ankle before halftime and came out for the third
quarter and wasn't feeling all that great,'' Brunell said. ``We
didn't get into an argument. I just encouraged him, I should say,
to keep me in there. It wasn't a confrontation. He felt I could
continue and I felt the same way.''
</P>
<P>
   Lucky for Jacksonville, Brunell played on. After a Robert
Edwards one-yard score helped cut the Jaguars' lead to 12-7 and a
Adam Vinatieri 27-yard field goal made it 12-10, there was a
momentum swing. Clearly, if the Jaguars did not score soon, they
were in danger of losing.
</P>
<P>
   That was when the Jaguars went to Smith, who was single-covered
by one of the top three cornerbacks in football, Ty Law. Smith ran
a deep go-route, and got a full step on Law, which has probably
happened against Law five times all year. Brunell threw a perfect
pass for the 37-yard score on way to a 19-10 lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have any excuses,'' said Law, who had nine
interceptions this season. ``I got beat on that play.''
</P>
<P>
   Soon after that pass, Zolak, playing for Drew Bledsoe, who has a
broken finger and who was on the sideline in civilian clothes, was
hit hard by defensive end Joel Smeenge. The ball dribbled loose and
was recovered by defensive lineman Tony Brackens. The turnover led
to a Mike Hollis 34-yard field goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``The momentum changed with the turnovers,'' said Coughlin.
``They had three turnovers and we did not turn the ball over, which
has been key for us all year.''
</P>
<P>
   Patriots Coach Pete Carroll also alluded to the turnovers. ``We
made a couple of careless mistakes early and the defense kept us in
the game,'' Carroll said. ``The offense came alive and 12 points
didn't seem too much. You just have to close it out when you make
those drives and we didn't do it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Jaguars were up by 12 points again, only this time there was
less than six minutes to play and they had learned their lesson.
They attacked the Patriots, not allowing them to catch their
breath. The last chance for New England to get back in the game
came on a fourth-and-15 at their 31-yard line, but Zolak was sacked
by Brackens.
</P>
<P>
   Then the Jaguars just handed the ball to running back Fred
Taylor on their next-to-last possession, and he ran the ball six
consecutive times, finishing with 162 yards on 33 rushes.
Jacksonville added a field goal _ this one from 21 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor is a rookie-of-the-year candidate, though he will most
likely be beaten out by Minnesota wide receiver Randy Moss. The
Jets will likely make him the focal point of their defensive
attack. Taylor's 162 yards against a good Patriots defense were the
third-highest total by a rookie in a playoff game, behind the
Washington Redskins' Tim Smith in 1988 (204) and the Los Angeles
Chargers' Paul Crowe in 1961 (165).
</P>
<P>
   ``There were rumbles out of New England that they were more
physical than we were,'' Taylor said. ``So the offensive line
wanted to come out and play physical. They did that.''

ANALYSIS: THE SHORT AND THE LONG OF A SENATE TRIAL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Texas, Miss., S.D., Ark., Mo., Fla.)  (Eds: See also IMPEACH-SENATE) 
(mk) 
 By ADAM CLYMER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The immediate politics of impeachment, to most
senators and to President Clinton, argue against a fullblown trial
_ with lengthy arguments, witnesses for and against the president,
and a requirement that senators sit there silently day after day,
listening.
</P>
<P>
   Since nobody except perhaps Rep. Tom DeLay, R-Texas, the
majority whip, appears to believe that the Senate might really vote
to convict Clinton and remove him from office, the argument goes,
why not get it over with quickly?
</P>
<P>
   Some quick resolution, including a censure, seems to be the goal
that Sens. Trent Lott, R-Miss., and Tom Daschle, D-S.D., the Senate
leaders, are pursuing with many other senators. Still, Sunday's
television chat programs made it clear that they have not found the
path to that end. And with the Senate, finding a direct route to
anything is almost unnatural.
</P>
<P>
   But there is a case for a trial. It is heard most often from the
president's critics in Congress who insist that when the
Constitution says, ``The Senate shall have the sole power to try
all impeachments,'' it offers no discretion.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Sen. Tim Hutchinson, R-Ark., said on the CBS News
program ``Face the Nation'' Sunday: ``I would be very skeptical of
bypassing what I think is our constitutional responsibility to have
a full airing of the evidence. I don't think that we should ever
stop thinking about the Constitution and the importance of setting
a precedent that is responsible.''
</P>
<P>
   For some in Congress who advocate a full trial, the hope that a
dozen or more Democrats will be persuaded to vote with Republicans
to remove the president springs eternal. For others in the House,
there is at least the hope of tarnishing the president's image
still more, and a sense that they did their part, and now the
Senate must do its duty.
</P>
<P>
   But there is another case for a trial, and it has support from
scholars who think that the case for impeachment made by the House
is frivolous.
</P>
<P>
   They argue that the Senate should weigh the risk that a quick
end to its proceedings would only serve to trivialize presidential
impeachments, and encourage the House in future exercises of
outrage that lack the gravity impeachment should demand.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Remini, university historian at the University of
Illinois at Chicago and biographer of Andrew Jackson, the only
president to be censured by the Senate, said Sunday he feared that
the consequence of a Senate ``short-circuit'' would be this lesson:
``You can impeach any time, and the Senate doesn't have to do
anything.'' But he said he was concerned that a trial would amount
to shutting down the government, or at least the Congress. But then
he mused, ``What would they do if they don't have a trial lasting
several months?''
</P>
<P>
   Joel Silbey, a Cornell historian, said he once thought the
Senate had to show respect for impeachment or it would encourage
irresponsible House actions in the future. But now, he said, ``most
of these guys are operating by short-term politics. If we dignify
this thing, then we're trapped. As constitutional as the procedure
is, the prospect of Monica Lewinsky being asked physical questions
_ where is the dignity?''
</P>
<P>
   Hans Trefousse, a retired historian at Brooklyn College and
biographer of both Andrew Johnson, the only president impeached
before Clinton, and his chief antagonist, Rep. Thaddeus Stevens,
said he thought that ``to short-circuit a trial is very
questionable'' in the long term. But he said ``it may be in the
national interest'' because of what testimony would actually
involve. ``This pornography that Starr raked up is not good for the
country,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Another argument for a full proceeding came from Ross Baker, a
Rutgers political scientist. ``For the Senate to breeze through it
manifests some contempt for the House,'' he said, and begs the
``basic constitutional question, the seriousness with which a
Senate, regardless of its partisan composition, has got to deal
with an impeachment when presented by the House.''
</P>
<P>
   He conceded that ``comity between the two houses is not a very
exciting issue, but it goes to the long-term relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Summary judgment,'' Baker said, ``is not what the framers had
in mind.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   One reason to avoid a trial is speed. Members of both parties
would rather fight about legislation than wait a few months while
they deal with Clinton's affair with Ms. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Another reason is their anticipation of what testimony they
would put before the nation, unless they blacked out part of the
trial from television, as Sen. John Ashcroft, R-Mo., suggested
might be done.
</P>
<P>
   On the television news programs Sunday, House Republicans who
want a trial sought to minimize that political fear.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Asa Hutchinson, R-Ark. (the senator's brother), appeared on
the ABC News program ``This Week'' and was asked, ``Would you want
to ask her the same kind of questions Judge Starr was criticized
for including in his report? How they conducted their assignations,
for instance?''
</P>
<P>
   ``No, absolutely not,'' Hutchinson replied. ``I do not believe
it is necessary for an evaluation of the case.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bill McCollum, R-Fla., another of the House impeachment
managers, said Ms. Lewinsky would have to be a witness, too, but
that the public was wrong to think ``that there would be a lot of
salacious questions asked.'' Appearing on ``Fox News Sunday,'' he
said, ``I don't anticipate the House managers are going to ask her
every one of those little questions that were so inflammatory.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps not, but their articles of impeachment accuse Clinton of
lying under oath about ``the nature and details of his
relationship'' with Ms. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   And even if an impeachment trial is fundamentally more political
than judicial, if the House managers seek to use Ms. Lewinsky's
testimony from Starr's grand jury, it is hard to imagine Senate
Democrats or White House lawyers not demanding that she be brought
forward for cross-examination.
</P>
<P>
   And while no one should discount the political nature of either
the process or the 100 senators/jurors, even when they talk about
being above politics, Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, made a useful
observation when he said on the NBC News program ``Meet the
Press'': ``Seems to me we're too preoccupied with what is good
politics for senators and not enough preoccupied with what we
should do to fulfill the constitutional process. I think we can do
it quickly. I hope we don't have to have witnesses, but we've got
to hear from the House and from the president.''

ROBOT BEGINS 11-MONTH JOURNEY AIMED AT FINDING WATER   ON MARS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By BETH DICKEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. _ A robot lander and two piggy-backed
microprobes Sunday embarked on the second of NASA's water missions
to Mars, launched here atop an unmanned Boeing Delta 2 rocket.
</P>
<P>
   After an 11-month journey, the Mars Polar Lander will parachute
gently to the surface of the red planet and start scooping up dirt
on Dec. 3, minutes after the twin probes it carries have slammed
into the ground at speeds up to 500 mph.
</P>
<P>
   Together, the trio of spacecraft will serve as a high-tech
divining rod to probe the soil of Mars for water in the form of ice
crystals. Water is a key ingredient for life, as well as an
important resource for human explorers who may visit Mars in the
distant future.
</P>
<P>
   ``Liftoff of the Delta 2 rocket carrying the Mars Polar Lander,
NASA's first visit to the red planet's southern pole,'' said a NASA
commentator, Lisa Malone, as the engines ignited at 3:21 p.m. to
catapult the rocket off a seaside launching pad at Cape Canaveral
Air Station. A camera mounted on the side of Delta 2 beamed
spectacular views of Earth as the booster sped to space.
</P>
<P>
   About 42 minutes after liftoff, the probe separated from the
rocket, revved up an attached motor to escape Earth's gravitational
pull, and began spreading its winglike solar power arrays.
</P>
<P>
   ``Absolutely clean separation from the launch vehicle third
stage has been confirmed,'' project manager John McNamee said. ``We
have a completely nominal spacecraft.''
</P>
<P>
   The Polar Lander is a companion to the Climate Orbiter, a
Martian weather satellite of sorts, now 4 million miles from Earth
after its launching last month. The orbiter will slip into orbit
around Mars on Sept. 23. Together, it and the lander are the second
in a 12-year series of dual missions aimed at returning a Martian
soil sample by 2008. The two spacecraft are worth $236 million,
including operating costs.
</P>
<P>
   The goal of the program is to understand Mars as a planet, ``but
I think the most compelling goal in the Mars Surveyor program is
basically to understand Mars as a possible abode for life,'' said
Edward Weiler, NASA's associate administrator for space science.
``You've got to follow the water if you're looking for life.''
</P>
<P>
   Scientists are convinced that Mars was a warmer, wetter planet 4
billion years ago. ``There's even a possibility that there was rain
on Mars a long, long time ago,'' Weiler said. ``We certainly know
water flowed on Mars.'' The lander and orbiter will try to
determine what made it become so cold and seemingly as dry as a
desert.
</P>
<P>
   If all goes as planned, the lander will parachute to a touchdown
at about 75 degrees south latitude, near the South Pole of Mars,
where spring and summer daytime temperatures hover around minus 100
degrees Celsius. No other spacecraft from Earth has landed so close
to the pole of a planet, an exciting event to scientists who hope
to discover there a vast reservoir of water in the form of layered
ice or small ice crystals.
</P>
<P>
   Each of the two saucer-shaped probes is about the size of a
basketball and weighs five and a half pounds. Five minutes before
the lander enters the Martian atmosphere, the two probes will break
away and drop like bombs. The probes are designed to crater on the
surface and burrow as deep as three feet, drill into the soil, and
heat the soil with lasers to analyze its water and carbon dioxide
content.
</P>
<P>
   The lander is expected to come to rest about 60 miles away from
the probes' impact point about a minute after they hit. The lander
will use a robotic arm to scoop up a small amount of soil and bake
it in a tiny oven to release water vapor.
</P>
<P>
   The lander also carries a small microphone provided by the
Planetary Society, a space advocacy organization. Scientists will
try to eavesdrop on nature, but do not expect to hear much more
than the landers gear's turning and maybe windblown dust hitting
the microphone. ``I don't think _ I hope to be wrong _ that we'll
actually hear the wind blowing through the trees and things like
that,'' said the project manager, McNamee.

HOPE EXCEEDS RETURNS IN THE SMALL-CAP UNIVERSE 
</HEADLINE>
  (ATTN: Minn.) 
(lb) 
 By KENNETH N. GILPIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Conventional wisdom has held that small companies grow faster
than big companies, small companies are nimbler than big companies,
and over time, small stocks outperform big stocks. But recent
experience has cast doubt on how valid these precepts still are.
</P>
<P>
   Stocks of small companies _ those with a market value of $300
million to $1.5 billion _ lagged behind their larger cousins last
year for the fifth consecutive year, despite a growing economy and
low interest rates. And some professionals are questioning the
viability of small stocks as an investment class.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not anti-small cap,'' said Frederick Taylor, vice
chairman and chief investment officer at U.S. Trust Co., ``but
there is no guarantee that small caps will outperform just because
they haven't for some time.''
</P>
<P>
   There are reasons to be skeptical. Earnings of small-cap
companies, which historically have outpaced those of big companies
when the economy is expanding, have trailed the earnings of the 100
biggest companies for most of the last five years, according to
statistics from Leuthold/Weeden Research, a Minneapolis-based
research firm.
</P>
<P>
   It has become clear in the last few years that ready access to
credit is a distinct edge large-cap companies have over smaller
concerns. And that edge, analysts say, is not likely to disappear
anytime soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Access to credit is an even bigger issue today than it used to
be,'' Taylor said. ``The big guys don't have to go to the bank to
get it. They can issue their own debt.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the agility issue. As developments through much of
the last two decades have shown, big companies are well aware that
they can no longer compete unless they are lean enterprises.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the small-cap track record of the last five years,
investors have remained hopeful. From 1992 until the end of 1997,
assets in small-cap mutual funds skyrocketed, to $136.1 billion,
from $22.1 billion, according to Lipper Inc. Through the end of
November, total net assets in small-cap funds fell to $127.2
billion, even as $5.7 billion in new money was added.
</P>
<P>
   Small-cap stocks do have advantages _ and champions. To start
with, as a group, they are cheap.
</P>
<P>
   ``Small-cap stocks are where all of the bargains are in the
market,'' said Joel Tillinghast, lead portfolio manager of the $9
billion Fidelity Low-Priced Stock Fund. Compared with big stocks,
``relative valuations are as compelling as they have been since I
started managing the fund,'' at the end of December 1989, he added.
</P>
<P>
   The comparison is even better than that, said Satya Pradhuman,
director of small-cap research at Merrill Lynch. ``Valuations are
at a 20-year low, with respect to big stocks,'' he said. ``That
suggests the risk levels in small caps currently are probably
lower.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Pradhuman worries that a big dive in major market
averages _ which are the exclusive domain of big-cap companies _
would bury small caps. It happened in the third quarter, and could
happen again.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts _ like Claudia Mott, director of small-cap
research at Prudential Securities _ are hopeful that last summer's
steep sell-off may have decreased the appetite for big-cap
companies.
</P>
<P>
   And, as Pradhuman suggested, if the past is any guide, recent
interest-rate cuts by the Federal Reserve Board should also help
small-cap stocks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rate cuts have tended to be very good catalysts for the
market,'' Ms. Mott said. ``Small- and mid-cap stocks have tended to
outperform in periods following rate cuts.''
</P>
<P>
   That has not happened yet, however. The Russell 2,000 index fell
more than 3 percent last year _ and is 14 percent below its peak in
April.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until the back is broken on the new Nifty Fifty big-cap
stocks, something that almost happened in August and September,
small caps won't outperform large caps,'' said John Laporte,
manager of T. Rowe Price's $4.7 billion New Horizons and $1.8
billion New America Growth Funds.
</P>
<P>
   Those considering an investment in small-cap stocks should pay
close attention to how the group does this month.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the small-cap market lags in January, it usually lags for
the year,'' Ms. Mott said. ``Since 1926, there have been 16
Januarys when small caps underperformed big caps. In only three of
those years did they end up beating the big caps'' for the entire
year.

`OUT OF SIGHT' VOTED BEST FILM OF '98 
</HEADLINE>
  (ATTN: Mass., Ill., Calif.) 
(lb) 
 By JANET MASLIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Out of Sight,'' Steven Soderbergh's frisky adaptation of an
Elmore Leonard crime novel, with Jennifer Lopez and George Clooney
as shrewd, sexy opposites who attract, was voted best film of 1998
by the National Society of Film Critics, a 51-member group
consisting of critics from New York, Boston, Los Angeles, Chicago
and other cities.
</P>
<P>
   Soderbergh's zesty and entertaining genre film became an
unexpected winner after several earlier ballots had favored
``Saving Private Ryan'' and ``Affliction.'' Those became the best
film runners-up.
</P>
<P>
   Soderbergh was also voted best director, followed by a tie
between Steven Spielberg and Terrence Malick for the year's huge
World War II epics, ``Saving Private Ryan'' and ``The Thin Red
Line.'' Those war films also stood out in the cinematography
category, where John Toll's work on ``The Thin Red Line'' was voted
the year's best.
</P>
<P>
   The group's choice of best actor was Nick Nolte, who won
resoundingly on a first ballot for his performance as a New
Hampshire man struggling with relentless, escalating pressures in
the wintry drama ``Affliction.'' He was followed by Ian McKellen,
who played the debonair ``Frankenstein'' director James Whale in
``Gods and Monsters,'' and Brendan Gleeson, who played wily Irish
gangsters in ``The General'' and ``I Went Down.''
</P>
<P>
   Best actress honors went to Ally Sheedy, who played a stellar
photographer and bewitching, decadent recluse in ``High Art.'' She
was followed in that category by Fernanda Montenegro of ``Central
Station'' and Cate Blanchett for playing the title role in
``Elizabeth.''
</P>
<P>
   In a very big year for that British queen, Judi Dench won the
best supporting actress award for also playing Elizabeth I, this
time in ``Shakespeare in Love.''
</P>
<P>
   In the best supporting actor category, Bill Murray's
``Rushmore'' performance, as a crafty tycoon matching wits with a
schoolboy, was cited. Murray was followed by Donald Sutherland, as
the sage track coach in ``Without Limits'' and Billy Bob Thornton
in ``A Simple Plan.''
</P>
<P>
   In a close vote, Scott Frank's adaptation of Leonard's ``Out of
Sight'' was named the year's best screenplay, immediately followed
by ``Shakespeare in Love''' and ``Rushmore.''
</P>
<P>
   Among nonfiction films, the group chose ``The Farm: Angola,
U.S.A.'' by Liz Garbus and Jonathan Stack for its tough,
compassionate look at the lives of inmates in a notorious Louisiana
prison. Other documentaries cited were Frederick Wiseman's ``Public
Housing,'' an enveloping, fly-on-the-wall look at many facets of an
inner-city housing project, and Werner Herzog's ``Little Dieter
Needs to Fly.''
</P>
<P>
   The group, which met at the Algonquin Hotel in New York on
Sunday and whose chairman is Peter Rainer of New York magazine,
selected the Iranian film ``Taste of Cherry'' by Abbas Kiarostami
as best foreign film.
</P>
<P>
   It also voted a best experimental film award to Alexander
Sokurov's ``Mother and Son,'' describing the film as ``a powerful
and moving exploration, through nontraditional narrative means, of
the intense relationship between a son and his dying mother.''
</P>
<P>
   And it voted a special award to Walter Murch, Rick Schmidlin,
Bob O'Neil and Jonathan Rosenbaum, the team responsible for
reassembling Orson Welles' ``Touch of Evil'' in a form that fit his
long-thwarted original intentions.

 &HT;    Lady Dogs ebb Tide in stretch
 &HT;    By Wendy Parker
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATHENS, Ga. _ A lowly strength of schedule number has been the
only nick on an otherwise perfect season thus far for No. 4
Georgia, but Sunday's 85-70 victory over 14th-ranked Alabama may
raise more than a computer calculation.
</P>
<P>
   Before 4,124 at Stegeman Coliseum, the Lady Dogs (12-0, 1-0)
opened their SEC schedule and put away their first ranked opponent
of the season by shooting 67 percent from the field in the second
half and limiting Alabama All-American Dominique Canty to just two
field goals in the last 13:12.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia showed signs of elevating into a full-fledged threat not
only in the SEC but beyond. It's just one league game, of course,
but Alabama had won two in a row from the Lady Dogs, who play host
to No. 20 Florida on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ''The real season started today,'' said forward Angie Ball, who
had 11 points before fouling out midway in the second half. ''We
can gauge ourselves a little bit more because we played a Top 15
team.''
</P>
<P>
   Georgia turned a tight affair into a double-digit lead in the
final five minutes of the game, thanks primarily to a zone defense
that denied Canty penetration. Alabama (10-4, 0-2), which had only
four field goals in a 10:55 second-half span, made just one of nine
3-point shots all afternoon. Canty equaled her average of 21
points, while Latrish Jones had 17 for the Crimson Tide.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly Miller, who scored 27 points and had seven assists and
five rebounds for Georgia, made three of four 3-point shots,
improving her marksmanship from that distance to 9 of 11 over the
past three games.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia's Deana Nolan, playing in her fourth game since becoming
academically eligible, handled Canty well one-on-one in the first
half. The lanky sophomore, nicknamed ''Tweety'' because of her
droopy eyes, also had 11 points and displayed flashes of pure
athleticism.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's pretty exciting to see Tweety play well,'' Georgia coach
Andy Landers said. ''She answered the Bell with Canty, but she ran
the floor and pulled up for the jumper. She just played well.''
</P>
<P>
   Nolan brushed aside full credit for the work on Canty: ''Our
plan was to give her a lot of different looks out there. She's
pretty tough. She's got a lot of good moves.''
</P>
<P>
   Coco Miller didn't play in the first half because of what
Landers described as ''practice problems.'' But in the second half,
she heated up for 14 points in 18 minutes. Her 3-pointer with 9:24
left gave Georgia a 61-55 lead, and Alabama got no closer.

 &HT;    College football's battle for No. 1
 &HT;    By Tony Barnhart
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, Ariz. _ This much we know. The winner of tonight's Fiesta
Bowl between No. 1 Tennessee and No. 2 Florida State will get at
least a share of the national championship. But as the 1998 college
football season draws to a close, there are still a number of
questions surrounding the future of a sport that remains popular,
but very controversial, in the way it handles its post season.
</P>
<P>
   Tonight's game marks the culmination of the first Bowl
Championship Series (BCS), a four-bowl rotation that includes the
Rose, Sugar, Orange, and Fiesta. Each year a different bowl gets
the ''national championship'' game and the Fiesta had the privilege
of going first. The Sugar Bowl in New Orleans gets the big game
next season which is set for Jan. 3, 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The BCS succeeded in its primary mission of getting the two
top-ranked teams together in one mega-game for the natonal
championship, giving college football the closest thing it has ever
had to the NFL's Super Bowl. Tickets to this game have a face value
of $135 and are going on the street for considerably more. Brokers
in Arizona said that if there were not two Southern teams playing
in the game, creating more nationwide interest, the street value of
those tickets would have easily topped $500 each this week.
</P>
<P>
   Media interest in tonight's game has broken every post-season
football record ever kept. Over 1,000 credentials have been issued
to print and electronic media, including 300 to ABC, which will
televise the game.
</P>
<P>
   While college football now has its ''big game,'' it has not
eliminated the controversy, criticism, and questions that follow
the sport because it does not have a post-season tournament to
determine its national champion like every other NCAA sport,
including the three lower divisions of football.
</P>
<P>
   That criticism and controversy, as it turns out, was not
necessarily a bad thing in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ''We had more people talking about college football this season
than at any time I can remember,'' said SEC Commissioner Roy
Kramer, the coordinator of the BCS. ''Talk shows that almost never
discuss college football were arguing over the merits of the BCS.
People were interested. Even if they were mad, they were
interested.''
</P>
<P>
   And those interested fans continue to raise key questions about
the sport, all the way up to tonight's Fiesta Bowl game. For
instance:
</P>
<P>
   _ Did the BCS computer formula really work?
</P>
<P>
   Depends on who you ask. The argument continues over which of the
once-beaten teams should be facing undefeated Tennessee (12-0)
tonight. The computer formula used by the BCS weighed several
factors and chose Florida State (11-1). Ohio State (11-1) feels
very strongly it should have been in this game.
</P>
<P>
   _ So does the winner of the Fiesta Bowl automtically win the
national championship?
</P>
<P>
   Only half of it. The American Football Coaches Association,
whose members vote in the USA Today/ESPN coaches poll, have already
determined that the winner of tonight's game will get their
national championship trophy. The Associated Press will conduct its
media poll right after the game, and those voters are free to pick
any team for the national championship.
</P>
<P>
   _ So if Florida State wins, is there still a shot for 11-1 Ohio
State?
</P>
<P>
   The Buckeyes, who beat Texas A&AMP;M 24-14 in the Sugar Bowl Friday
night, have been lobbying for about a week that they should get
some national championship consideration if Florida State beats
Tennessee. They were No. 1 for nine weeks before losing to Michigan
State 28-24.
</P>
<P>
   The odds appear long.
</P>
<P>
   ''If Tennessee wins I've got no argument,'' said Ohio State
coach John Cooper. ''But if Florida State wins, I think we can
claim it (the national championship) as much as anybody. We still
think we have the best team in the country.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Will the BCS change the complex formula it used to pick its
top two teams?
</P>
<P>
   There will be some tweaking of the formula in the offseason,
Kramer indicated, and it may with the computer poll component of
the formula. That was the portion that most fans found confusing.
</P>
<P>
   _ Because of the BCS structure, Big East champ Syracuse (8-4)
got into the Orange Bowl while Kansas State got left out with an
11-1 record. Why don't they just pick the best teams for the big
bowls instead of worrying about the conference champions?
</P>
<P>
   Any agreement among the bowls and the conferences must take care
of the conference champions. If not, that conference will simply go
out and cut its own deal with a bowl and refuse to participate.
</P>
<P>
   _ How long is the BCS going to last and, with all the
controversy, are we any closer to a playoff?
</P>
<P>
   The BCS has a four-year contract with ABC through the 2001
season with an option for a three-year extension. The plan is to
get to 2001 and take another survey of the financial landscape. A
Swiss-based company, ISL, is floating a plan for a 16-team
tournament that would pay the 112 Division I schools about $300
million per year, or $2.4 billion over eight years. The current
bowl system generates about $140 million for the schools.
</P>
<P>
   _ So why don't the schools just take the money and do it?
</P>
<P>
   While more and more coaches are in favor of a playoff, the vast
majority of university presidents are against it. They are already
concerned that football is the athletic tail wagging the academic
dog and aren't sure they want it to get any bigger than it already
is. The commissioners aren't in favor of a playoff because under
the current system, they control the money. Under a playoff, the
NCAA would control the money.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, this is the reality college football officials work
with every day. The sport is in great shape. Television ratings are
fragmented, but as a total are higher than ever. College football
attendance hit an all-time higher this year for the second straight
year. Some bowls are struggling, but there is more money in the
bowl system than ever before.
</P>
<P>
   But how long can college football maintain this level of
interest under the current system of bowls versus playoffs? That is
the ulitimate question the sport must face as it heads into the
next century.
</P>
<P>
   SO WHO'S NO. 1?
</P>
<P>
   The winner of tonight's Fiesta Bowl game will automatically be
declared national champions by the USA Today/ESPN coaches poll. But
the Associated Press will wait until after the game to conduct its
media poll and its national champion will be declared early Tuesday
morning. A look at the teams which could conceivably claim the
national title:
</P>
<P>
   TENNESSEE (12-0): If the Vols beat Florida State tonight, it's a
no-brainer. The SEC champions will be one of two unbeaten teams
(Tulane is the other) and will have defeated three BCS teams:
Syracuse, Florida, and Florida State.
</P>
<P>
   FLORIDA STATE (11-1): If the Seminoles beat Tennessee, they
would have gone 12-1 against the fourth toughest schedule in the
country. They would have beaten three BCS teams: Texas A&AMP;M,
Florida, and Tennessee. No other team can touch FSU's
non-conference schedule of Texas A&AMP;M, Southern California, Miami,
and Florida.
</P>
<P>
   OHIO STATE (11-1): The Buckeyes, who beat Texas A&AMP;M in the 24-14
in the Sugar Bowl, were No. 1 for nine weeks before losing to 6-6
Michigan State 28-24. If Florida State beats Tennessee, Ohio State
believes they have as much claim to the AP national champion as any
team with one loss. Coach John Cooper believes the fact that his
team lost by only four points while Florida State lost 24-7 to N.C.
State should be a consideration.
</P>
<P>
   WISCONSIN (11-1): The Badgers had only one bad game this season,
a 27-10 loss at Michigan in its next to last game of the season.
But Wisconsin did not play Ohio State during its Big Ten schedule
and in the minds of the voters, the Buckeyes are a superior team.
</P>
<P>
   TULANE (12-0): If Florida State defeats Tennessee, the Green
Wave will be the only undefeated Division I team left standing. But
Tulane beat only two bowl teams in Louisville (7-5) and Southern
Mississippi (7-5), both fellow members of Conference USA.
</P>
<P>
   ARIZONA (12-1): The Wildcats had only eight minutes of bad
football this year, when UCLA scored 28 unanswered points to turn a
close game into a 52-28 blowout. Arizona had the Pac-10's best
rushing defense and held five opponents to a touchdown or less. The
win over Nebraska in the Holiday Bowl put the perfect finish to the
best season in school history.

 &HT;    Lady Luck has been Tennessee's 12th man
 &HT;    By Steve Hummer
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, Ariz. _ Having run out of ways to bleed a few more days
or dollars from the college football season, we come to tonight's
computer-generated, corn chip-sponsored national championship game.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, four days into the new year, as soon as Florida State
receiver Peter Warrick trips over a Gila monster just short of the
goal line, or Vols kicker Jeff Hall's winning 60-yard field goal is
aided by a freak desert dust storm, Tennessee's amazing run will be
done.
</P>
<P>
   Then coach Phillip Fulmer will be free to drive to Las Vegas,
put his new Tennessee contract on red and let it ride on one spin
of the wheel. When you're hot, that's not the time to back off.
</P>
<P>
   There are all kinds of good, solid football factors at play
tonight between No. 1 Tennessee and No. 2 FSU. It is the battle
between voracious defenses. It is a parade of electric skill
players. It is grim business at the line of scrimmage.
</P>
<P>
   And then there is the one issue that gets into grayer areas: It
is pretty well agreed that the Vols have spent this season with a
horseshoe lodged securely somewhere on their collective body. No
one has been able to knock it loose yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, we have been fortunate,'' Fulmer said. ``I like to be
good and lucky, then you've got something special going.''
</P>
<P>
   The gut says that the Seminoles will deny Tennessee its first
national title in 47 years. The ruthless makers of odds have made
the No. 2 Seminoles solid favorites. Bobby Bowden is 15-3-1 (.816)
in bowls at FSU, Fulmer 4-2 (.666) at Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the Vols have gotten the pass interference
call they needed to win at Syracuse, the missed 32-yard field goal
to beat Florida in overtime, the immaculate fumble to overcome
Arkansas. I was on the sideline, 20 feet from Clint Stoerner's
stumbling fumble, and still don't know if I could testify to a
grand jury that it actually happened. Every review of the Tennessee
seasons reads as fortunate as the diary of an heiress.
</P>
<P>
   This creates the belief that something wondrous will arise to
save the Vols tonight. Some weird turn, some phenomenon, some
convulsion of fate that will favor Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   This also slightly stains the 12-0 record it brings into the
evening. As if the Vols were merely passengers delivered to the
Fiesta Bowl by happenstance. They'd like to think they had
something to do with the past four months.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think people feel like we were lucky and that we shouldn't
be here,'' receiver Peerless Price said. ``We are going to put all
those doubts to rest (tonight). We were the underdog (at) Georgia,
at home against Florida and on the road against Syracuse. We've
proven the doubt wrong all year long.'' Luck is a four-letter word,
almost dirty in certain parts of Knoxville.
</P>
<P>
   In fairness, it's not as if FSU hasn't had a little help. It can
lose to North Carolina State and win a national championship in the
same season _ one of the strangest turns yet. ``Ohio State had to
lose. UCLA had to lose. Kansas State had to lose. But nobody's
talking about how lucky Florida State has been to get here,'' Vols
receiver Cedrick Wilson said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Florida State is the practical, nuts-and-bolts pick. If
you happen to side with forces unseen and the concept of destiny,
then Tennessee is your team tonight.

SPORTS COLUMN: JORDAN'S RETURN COULD DEPEND ON LEAGUE'S IMAGE
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By SELENA ROBERTS  
  
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Michael Jordan has been a pantomime during these last tense
weeks of the National Basketball Association's six-month-old
lockout, a figure in motion on the golf course, but silent on the
issues.
</P>
<P>
   Why risk dipping an image as wholesome as baked cookies into the
mud that has been slung during this labor dispute? He tried to mix
it up once in a pre-Halloween collective-bargaining session, but
looked like a bully when he challenged 74-year-old Abe Pollin,
owner of the Washington Wizards, to sell his team if he couldn't
make a profit.
</P>
<P>
   After the exchange, Jordan's agent, David Falk, boasted that he
had all but planted the words in Jordan's head. Not only had Jordan
lowered himself into one of the countless no-win verbal frays
during this lockout, but he looked as much like an agent's puppet
as anyone else.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan has since ducked out of the labor skirmish. He can't win
this one. He can't shake the owners the way he did Utah's Bryon
Russell in last year's Game 6 to waltz off with a finals' victory.
</P>
<P>
   As a meticulous caretaker of his image, Jordan has learned not
to attach himself to losing situations. He is keenly apolitical and
removes himself from controversial subjects, whether the topic is
working conditions at overseas Nike plants or the calamitous
exhibition game agents organized in Atlantic City, N.J., on Dec.
19.
</P>
<P>
   He steered away from the latter, and he must realize there are
few topics outside of Washington's Beltway creating more negative
vibes than the NBA. So why expose an untainted legacy by returning
for a makeshift season that will be pockmarked with an asterisk,
empty seats and unsavory characters?
</P>
<P>
   Unless Jordan retires, this is the NBA that he'll step back into
if the season is saved before a board of governors vote Thursday.
There is no league exception in anyone's proposal for fan
resentment. Even the impervious Jordan _ rarely injured, seldom
beaten _ is vulnerable to fan apathy aimed at everyone who has made
a gaudy living off the game. Jordan has earned his luxury
lifestyle, but playground interviews with children have unveiled an
aversion to even the greatest player in the game.
</P>
<P>
   To associate himself with a slumping product like the NBA may
not make a return worth it to him, even if Scottie Pippen returns
to the Bulls for an encore, too. Not only would Jordan have to play
a harried season _ taking on as many as three opponents on three
consecutive nights _ Jordan, who will be 36 next month, would have
to accept (or ignore) the input of Tim Floyd, who took over for
Phil Jackson on the Bulls' sideline.
</P>
<P>
   For Jordan, it's like someone changing the recipe on his
favorite dish. What was familiar and anticipated _ as in the
Zen-like atmosphere and basketball compatibility supplied by
Jackson _ will be replaced by something new and unsettling.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe he can adjust. But even those outside the gossipy Charles
Barkley _ who recently disclosed that Jordan told him he has ``had
enough'' and will retire _ believe he has nothing to gain by
chancing the last image of him on the court: the game-winning shot
to capture the Bulls' sixth title last June in Utah.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Michael Jordan has something to say,'' Jordan said,
uncharacteristically launching into the third person upon hearing
Barkley's remarks, ``I'll say it.''
</P>
<P>
   When the lockout out ends _ and days pass as the Bulls make
their personnel decisions _ that's when he will talk. But there are
hints that his future is already decided. Barkley's ramblings
aside, there are whispers that Jordan has tapered off his rigid
workout routines over the last few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, Jordan's walking around shape is probably better than
most players at mid-season, and he could snap back to form as quick
as a child's pop-up book. But if observers are right, Jordan
certainly owes nothing to the owners and league leaders who have
refused to be awestruck by his presence at negotiating sessions.
</P>
<P>
   It's as if they have gotten their use out of Jordan. The current
television deal will outlive Jordan's career, and his $33 million
salary only pumps up the dreams of the misguided stars who believe
they are the next Jordan. When he made his surprise presence at a
marathon session last month, no one blinked and no progress was
made.
</P>
<P>
   As the meeting continued on its bleak path, Jordan sneaked out
of the hotel through the back entrance. Cameras caught up to him
but he refused to comment.
</P>
<P>
   This time, he had learned the value of silence. What was he
going to say that wouldn't have sounded petty? Throughout the labor
dispute, he has used this same strategy of silence to keep his
future plans to himself. Some owners privately wish for his
departure _ hey, let someone else win for once _ but the league's
life after the lockout will be difficult to bear without his
influence.
</P>
<P>
   The NBA still needs Jordan, particularly now. Who else has
proven his heart and love of the game like Jordan has? These are
feel-good qualities the NBA will have to push to recapture a
skeptical public. These are qualities Jordan has in bulk.
</P>
<P>
   People should hope that Jordan is a glory junkie and cannot
withdraw from the game just yet. Isn't winning a seventh title
despite Floyd enough of a challenge? Isn't golf just competitive
candy next to the real thing?
</P>
<P>
   But the reality is that Jordan may not want to be part of this
less appealing NBA. In the coming weeks if there is a season _ or
in the coming year if there isn't _ Jordan will choose his exit
strategy. He can retire and select Game 6 of the finals as his
lasting impression. Or he can soar on for a league that is curdling
and bound to lose the luster that Jordan worked so hard to shine.
</P>
<P>
   If fan apathy meters are correct, Jordan could win a seventh
title only to hear a collective reply of, ``So what?''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, you can't win. So you have to wonder if Jordan, never
one to associate himself with a no-win situation, would rather bow
out gracefully or risk being attached to the unsightly image of the
NBA.

FIESTA BOWL CAPSULE: SEMINOLES HAVE EDGE
</HEADLINE>
 CAPSULE-TEX (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By WENDELL BARNHOUSE 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Florida State (11-1) vs. Tennessee (12-0)
</P>
<P>
   Time: 7 tonight
</P>
<P>
   Location: Sun Devil Stadium, Tempe, Ariz.
</P>
<P>
   TV: ABC
</P>
<P>
   How they got here: Tennessee is champion of the Southeastern
Conference and Florida State champion of the Atlantic Coast
Conference. That assured each team of a spot in the Bowl
Championship Series. They're playing for the national championship
because the final BCS computer rankings had Tennessee No. 1 and
Florida State No. 2.
</P>
<P>
   Retrospective: The Seminoles are making their 17th consecutive
bowl appearance and 27th overall. They're 16-8-2. The Volunteers
are making their 10th consecutive bowl appearance and 39th overall.
They're 21-17-0.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents: They played one common opponent, Florida. Tennessee
beat the Gators, 20-17, in overtime. Florida State beat the Gators,
23-12. Opponents' records _ Tennessee, 69-52; Florida State, 77-44.
</P>
<P>
   What you need to know: Tennessee is seeking its first national
championship since 1951. Florida State won its only national
championship in 1993. This is the 12th time the nation's No. 1 and
No. 2 teams have played in a bowl. The top-ranked team has won six
times.
Who has the edge? Rushing offense Florida State: 150 yards per game
Tennessee: 211 yards per game Edge: Tennessee
</P>
<P>
   The Volunteers win the old-fashioned way. They like to line up
and pound the ball downfield. Sophomore tailback Travis Henry (970
yards, seven TDs) is a powerful runner who won't break the big play
but seems to always get positive yards. The Seminoles have a game
breaker in sophomore tailback Travis Minor (857 yards, seven TDs),
but he gained fewer yards in more carries compared to Henry.
Passing offense Florida State: 251 yards per game Tennessee: 187
yards per game Edge: Tennessee
</P>
<P>
   Statistically, it would appear the Seminoles have the better air
attack. But with inexperienced Marcus Outzen at quarterback,
Florida State will keep things simple. The Seminoles have several
big-play receivers, led by Peter Warrick (12 TDs, 20 yards per
catch). Tennessee QB Tee Martin had 19 TD passes and only six
interceptions. His favorite target is Peerless Price (61
receptions, 10 TDs).
Rushing defense Florida State: 80 yards per game Tennessee: 94
yards per game Edge: Even
</P>
<P>
   Both teams have the size and speed to bring a lot of force to
the point of attack. The Volunteers, in particular, like for the
other team's offense to try to pound the ball on the ground. Junior
tackles Jerry Johnson and Corey Simon are the Seminoles' main run
stoppers. Each team allowed only five rushing touchdowns all
season.
</P>
<P>
   Passing defense Florida State: 135 yards per game Tennessee: 209
yards per game Edge: Florida State
</P>
<P>
   If Tennessee's defense has a weakness, it appears to be in its
secondary. Opposing quarterbacks completed 52 percent of their
passes and averaged nearly 12 yards per completion. Florida State,
which leads the nation in pass defense, allowed opposing QBs to
complete only 41 percent. And that helps explain why Seminoles
opponents converted only 19 percent of their third-down situations.
</P>
<P>
   Coaching Florida State: Bobby Bowden (33rd season, 292-84-4)
Tennessee: Phillip Fulmer (7th season, 66-11-0) Edge: Even
</P>
<P>
   Bowden has won 12 of his past 13 bowl games. But the past two
times the Seminoles have been in position for the national
championship _ the 1996 Sugar Bowl and last season against Florida
_ they lost. Fulmer leads active coaches in winning percentage. And
there is much to be said for his effort this season in guiding a
team few considered would contend for a championship to within a
victory of the title.
Special teams Edge: Florida State
</P>
<P>
   Both teams have excellent kickers _ Jeff Hall for Tennessee and
Sebastian Janikowski for Florida State. However, Janikowski has
more range, both on field goals and kickoffs. Each team has
returners capable of breaking the big play, but the Seminoles
appear to have a slight edge there. Both punters are solid.
Prediction: Florida State 24, Tennessee 21  &LR; name:_ Wendell
Barnhouse

<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Israeli police officials Sunday arrested eight
American members of a Denver-based apocalyptic cult who the
officials said were planning to mark the millennium by committing
suicide or provoking their own killings in the streets of
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   The police said the eight belonged to the Concerned Christians
cult, whose members disappeared early last fall, emptying out their
houses and leaving Colorado without a trace. The cult members
planned to destroy themselves shortly before the millennium in
order to hasten the Second Coming of Christ, the police officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They planned to carry out violent and extreme acts in the
streets of Jerusalem at the end of 1999 to start the process of
bringing Jesus back to life,'' said Brig. Gen. Elihu Ben-Onn, an
Israeli police general.
</P>
<P>
   The cultists specifically wanted to create a catastrophic event
by provoking a deadly shootout with the police in the Old City,
where by Christian tradition the tomb of Jesus lies, in the Church
of the Holy Sepulcher, a police official said.
</P>
<P>
   Their leader, Monte Kim Miller, a former marketing executive for
Procter &AMP; Gamble who claimed he could speak in the voice of God,
had predicted that he would die in Jerusalem in 1999. But he was
not among those arrested and the authorities here do not believe he
is in Israel.
</P>
<P>
   The eight were to be brought before a judge within 24 hours, but
the Israelis plan to deport them rather than to prosecute them.
They also intend to track down what they say may be dozens more
cult members who have eluded the police.
</P>
<P>
   Brig. Gen. Hezi Leder, the police attache at the Israeli Embassy
in Washington, said of the arrests, ``There probably will be
more.''
</P>
<P>
   Israeli police officials fear that this may be the beginning of
a wave of apocalypse-seekers who could descend on Jerusalem in
advance of the millennium. Already, dozens of American Christians
have settled here in anticipation of the year 2000. Some of them
have rented rooms at the base of the Mount of Olives, to secure
what they hope will be a bird's-eye view of Christ's reappearance
at the spot where the Gospels recorded an apocalyptic vision of the
future.
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli authorities are courting Christian pilgrims to
celebrate the millennium here, but some experts on the millennium
have warned them that they could be playing with fire. Many insist,
though, that the potentially dangerous groups will be a minority.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't say there are not fundamentalists or extremists, but
it's all out of proportion to think only of them,'' said Uri Mor,
the deputy director of the Religious Affairs Ministry, who oversees
relations with the Christian communities here. ``Of course, you
have to take care, but in proportion.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the police made it clear that with these arrests they
were drawing a line in the sand.
</P>
<P>
   ``The police will continue to work in every legal way possible
to allow for freedom of religion and ritual in Jerusalem and in
Israel for all religions in the years of the millennium,'' said
Gen. Yair Yitzrak, chief commander of the Jerusalem Police
District. ``However, we will act firmly against the attempts of
extreme groups to block access to other Christians in the year
1999.''
</P>
<P>
   In Colorado, relatives of the cult members said they had
expected the arrests.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew they were going to deport them a couple of weeks
ago,'' said John Weaver of Lakewood, Colo., whose daughter used to
be a member of the group. ``Israel is trying to set an example that
they don't want these millennial groups.''
</P>
<P>
   Late Sunday afternoon, the police, together with Shin Bet
security agents, took the eight adults, together with six children,
into custody after a raid on two suburban-style homes in the
western outskirts of the city.
</P>
<P>
   The members, whom they did not identify, had been living quietly
in two relatively affluent neighborhoods, surviving on their
savings and on donations from abroad, said police officials, who
are working in conjunction with the American authorities.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could see them here sitting around all day,'' said Nir
Hanuni, a neighbor in the suburb of Mevasseret Zion. ``You could
call it idleness. The children, of course, were not registered at
any school around here. ``
</P>
<P>
   In Colorado, some relatives of the sect members have been
frustrated by the refusal of the Israeli Embassy in Washington to
provide a list of members of the group who have been located in
Israel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why can't anybody tell me where he is?'' Jennifer Cooper said
in Denver, speaking of her father, John Cooper. Cooper disappeared
with the group last summer. Citing electronic messages sent to her,
she added, ``We have been led to believe that he is not in
Israel.''
</P>
<P>
   An American expert on millennial movements predicted that after
Easter the number of Americans millennialists converging on
Jerusalem would swell.
</P>
<P>
   ``By the end of the Easter season, you can expect hundreds there
unless the Israelis are pushing hard to get these people away,''
said Richard Landes, director of the Center for Millennial Studies
at Boston University.

CRITIC'S NOTEBOOK: THE HIGH-WIRE ACT OF PLAYING FROM MEMORY 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By ALLAN KOZINN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Two contrasting images stand out from among the last year's
evenings in the concert hall. One is of a young violinist, a
well-trained, interpretively astute contest winner, who played a
Mozart sonata at his debut recital. I have forgotten the details of
his reading, and even his name, but what I remember is that he
stood before a music stand and played the sonata from the score.
</P>
<P>
   One doesn't see that very often. Soloists usually play standard
repertory works from memory. Audiences have been conditioned to
expect as much, and although this violinist's listeners may have
admired his performance, they are bound to have felt slightly
shortchanged.
</P>
<P>
   That may be unfair, not least because the work would not have
had memorized performances in the drawing rooms of Mozart's time.
But fair or not, when a recitalist plays familiar music from the
score, audiences read it as a lack of preparedness or commitment.
</P>
<P>
   The other image is of Eighth Blackbird, a new music sextet fresh
out of the Oberlin Conservatory. The group opened its debut concert
with Fred Lerdahl's ``Fantasy Etudes,'' a complex work of
continually changing balances, in which precision is a must. The
ensemble performed the work from memory, and added choreography _ a
slow wandering around the stage _ that underscored the work's
shifting combinations of flute, clarinet, violin, cello and
percussion.
</P>
<P>
   This was doubly surprising. Chamber ensembles, in both new and
old music, almost invariably use scores to prevent train wrecks.
And just as one expects standard repertory to be memorized, the
presumption with complex new works is that they will be played from
the music. Context is everything: With a new work, the presence of
the score may emphasize its newness or lend authority to the
performance.
</P>
<P>
   The Eighth Blackbird players said that memorizing the Lerdahl
was an experiment, and they used scores for the other works on
their program. But the performance left an indelible impression,
not only because it was so finely polished, but also because we
read the memorization of contemporary chamber works as a sign of
commitment beyond the call of duty.
</P>
<P>
   Still, this business of memorization is not as clear-cut as it
may seem, and musicians and colleagues with whom I've discussed it
have taken positions all over the map.
</P>
<P>
   In practical terms, few major soloists would dream of playing
standard repertory publicly with a score before them, nor would
they allow their students to do so. Some go as far as to insist
that all memorization is not equal. This school holds that visceral
memory _ having the music in one's fingers as the result of playing
it hundreds of times _ is not true memorization at all, but purely
a question of mechanics.
</P>
<P>
   A musician, even an amateur, who has learned a piece through
repetition can play it absentmindedly while reading or watching
television. Once it's in the fingers, the player knows what to do.
But it's all or nothing. Ask a musician with a visceral memory of a
work to play its bass line or to isolate an inner voice, and he's
in trouble. That requires a more intellectually rigorous form of
memorization, built on a thorough study of the music.
</P>
<P>
   There are, however, musicians who insist that memorization is
overvalued. They hold that visceral memory is sufficient, that once
the fingers know what to do, the mind is free to direct them in
matters of interpretive nuance. Having the score onstage, they say,
is a security blanket that helps stave off memory slips.
</P>
<P>
   And they point to a double standard in today's musical culture:
Concert goers demand the perfection they hear on recordings, yet at
recording sessions, musicians virtually always use scores, to say
nothing of the editing techniques that make idealized performances
possible.
</P>
<P>
   Where memorization is concerned, there are double standards and
hierarchies of all kinds. A soloist is expected to have a work
memorized, yet the accompanist sitting a few feet away is cut more
slack.
</P>
<P>
   But that's only fair. Accompanists are hired hands who may be
juggling five or six programs in a week. Besides, their scores may
bear penciled reminders of tempos and emphases that the
soloist-du-jour prefers, information a busy accompanist need not
commit to memory.
</P>
<P>
   For an accompanist, though, having the music can be a
double-edged sword. With the printed music before him, the
accompanist is expected to be a life raft when the soloist is at
sea. If the soloist gets lost and begins to vamp, the accompanist
must lead the way home without calling attention to the soloist's
lapse _ or at least, that's the ideal.
</P>
<P>
   In one famous if possibly apocryphal story, Fritz Kreisler had a
memory slip while playing a Beethoven violin sonata with Sergei
Rachmaninoff. As Kreisler improvised in search of the thread, he
whispered, ``Do you know where we are?'' Rachmaninoff's mordant
reply was ``Yes, we're on the stage of Carnegie Hall.''
</P>
<P>
   There have been cases, too, when soloists have minimized the
advantage that their score-reading accompanists have. The cellist
Mstislav Rostropovich once took his seat onstage, raised his bow
and looked to see if his accompanist, Samuel Sanders, was ready to
begin. After fumbling through his score for a moment, Sanders
walked offstage with his music, leaving Rostropovich looking
impatient.
</P>
<P>
   What the audience didn't know was that Rostropovich, in an idle
moment, had glued a Playboy centerfold into Sanders' score.
Backstage, Sanders removed the photograph, and the show went on.
</P>
<P>
   Now and then, a musician for whom I have great respect confounds
expectations and performs from printed music. Andras Schiff used a
score in his recent traversal of the Bartok piano concertos at
Carnegie Hall. Schiff is a superb interpreter of Bartok and much
else; I can't imagine that any serious listener's respect for his
work was diminished as a result.
</P>
<P>
   What, on the other hand, does one make of Luciano Pavarotti? He
has memorized many of the great tenor roles in the Italian opera
repertory, but although his concert repertory is tiny _ he has
juggled the same program-and-a-half's worth of art songs,
Neapolitan lollipops and favorite arias for the last 25 years _ he
never gives a recital without a music stand.
</P>
<P>
   The stand doesn't actually have music on it, just the song
texts, in large print. Is it too much to expect him to have
memorized those texts by now?
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   One charitable colleague argued that musicians should be allowed
to take their scores onstage. ``Expecting a musician to perform
without the score is like expecting a high-wire artist to perform
without a net,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   I don't buy it. A high-wire artist who falls risks serious
bodily harm, perhaps even death. A musician who has a memory slip,
and no score to quickly check, might be embarrassed. It's not the
same.
</P>
<P>
   The real question is what we want from a concert performance.
There are, of course, the lofty expectations that art engenders. We
want our emotions and intellect to be engaged, and we want to
glimpse sublime truths between the notes of a great work in a
transcendent performance.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps a musician reading from a score can create that
experience. Clearly, it's possible on recordings. But in the
concert hall, our eyes are engaged as well as our ears, and they
tell us that a score-reading soloist is too tightly bound to the
mundane world of dots on a page to touch a higher plane.
</P>
<P>
   And there is a degree to which musical performance is a
high-wire act. Ever since Mozart and Beethoven dazzled audiences
with daring improvisations, and Paganini and Liszt stunned
listeners with seemingly inhuman technical display, audiences have
expected virtuosity as part of the concert experience.
</P>
<P>
   Memorization is an aspect of the challenge. It is the difference
between virtuosity and mere muscularity. And for this special
species of daredevilry to work, there can't be any nets in sight.

GINGRICH ADVISES REPUBLICANS TO LIE LOW FOR AWHILE 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ Rep. Newt Gingrich may be on his way out of the
speaker's office, but his mind is still actively concocting grand
strategies to save the Republican majority in Congress that his
critics say he nearly destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   Most important, he told a group of conservatives here,
Republicans need to present themselves as the party of tax cuts.
His big mistake last year, he said, was failing to push for
substantial tax cuts early in the year and then being too exhausted
to focus on them later, when Washington became enveloped in the
impeachment of President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   But he also urged his party to lie low for the next two years to
regroup and rethink its approach to keeping the House and winning
the presidency. Such passivity seemed a curious retreat for the
self-declared leader of the Republican revolution, but it reflected
what his friends said was his belief that Washington had become too
ferociously partisan to get anything done.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the standpoint of the House and Senate,'' Gingrich said,
``if we can adopt as our primary slogan `Do no harm' and simply
block liberal measures for two years and set the stage for a
Republican presidency, that is probably the most we can hope for,
given the nature of the current Washington environment.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, he encouraged his party, if indirectly, to press forward
with the impeachment process _ a process that he was rebuked for
over-emphasizing during last fall's elections and that helped push
him out of the speakership.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans, he said, should ``calmly and directly stand for the
rule of law and do so without embarrassment'' and ``stand for the
Constitution no matter what the cost.''
</P>
<P>
   Friends said Gingrich was determined not to attack Clinton in
his speech. The phrase ``rule of law'' has become Republican
shorthand for pursuing Clinton for perjury, even as the president's
supporters dismiss his actions in the Lewsinky scandal as a minor
breach. But that was Gingrich's only remark that drew resounding
and sustained applause, and it won him a standing ovation.
</P>
<P>
   He spoke here Saturday night at a banquet that concluded a
four-day annual New Year's conference of about 300 conservatives
called The Weekend but known as the Dark Ages. Many of the
attendees spent the afternoon before Gingrich's speech at a nearby
shooting range firing rifles and automatic weapons at an event
sponsored by the National Rifle Association.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich officially gives up the speaker's gavel on Wednesday,
two months after he announced his resignation from the speakership
and from Congress. He plans to write, tour the lecture circuit and
divide his time between Washington and Atlanta, where he will work
as a strategic consultant to corporations.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich will also continue to raise money for Republican
candidates. Joe Gaylord, his long-time adviser, said that Gingrich
had raised more than $200 million over the last four years, making
him the party's top fundraiser.
</P>
<P>
   Gaylord said that Gingrich, 55, would not be a candidate for
president in 2000, ``but who knows after that?'' He added: ``He
doesn't feel old. He's not hanging up the spurs.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, Gingrich is formulating a vision for his party, making
lists, like six things Republicans should do to expand their
majority, and ruminating about the end of his House career.
</P>
<P>
   He quit, he said, ``in part because I believed that it was
impossible in the current situation in Washington to have any
opportunity to focus on vision and strategies at a time when those
in fact were our most important challenge.''
</P>
<P>
   He also suggested that he had emphasized the wrong issues, like
impeachment over taxes. Again, he did not mention impeachment
directly but suggested that he had allowed the media to overblow
his role in it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pick issues that the liberal media elite cannot distort,'' he
told the audience. ``This was my biggest mistake in 1998 _ it was
partly a function of focusing too much on managing the House,
partly it was a function of exhaustion and trying to deal with the
complexity of Washington.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``In the information age, you cannot allow the elite
media to define the election or they will always define it on the
left. We should have had a much bigger fight in the spring over tax
cuts and we should have stayed with the tax-cut message all summer
long and we should have unified the party by using brute
persistence, and there I think frankly that exhaustion was a big
factor.''
</P>
<P>
   As for conservatives, he told them to be bold and practical,
rather than theoretical. It has been a big mistake, he said, for
politicians to go on the Sunday television talk shows and ``talk in
abstract code words in a cynical, pompous and negative way about a
topic that doesn't matter'' to most people. ``Normal people,'' he
said, prefer to watch football.
</P>
<P>
   Many in the audience found Gingrich's speech inspiring. ``The
party needs someone to be a visionary and keep us on a core
national agenda,'' said Scott Bundgaard, a state senator from
Arizona. ``He's recognized his mistakes and he's stepping back up
to the plate to refocus us.''

CLINTON SHOULD DELAY STATE OF UNION MESSAGE, SOME SENATORS SAY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Miss., S.D., Wash., Conn., Texas, Pa., N.J., Ky., Vt.)  (Eds: See also IMPEACH-ASSESS, REPUBS-POLITICS) 
(mk) 
 By ALISON MITCHELL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With a new Congress set to be sworn in this week,
several influential senators said Sunday that President Clinton
should postpone his State of the Union message if the Senate is
still grappling with an impeachment trial when he is scheduled to
appear before a joint session of Congress on January 19.
</P>
<P>
   The call to delay the president's annual policy address _ from
Republicans and Democrats alike _ underscored how the 16th
Congress would convene Wednesday under the same shadow of
impeachment that so sharply divided the 105th Congress and turned
its last days into a brutally partisan confrontation over the
president's fate.
</P>
<P>
   Fearful that months more could be consumed by a trial of the
president on the two articles of impeachment approved by the House,
Sens. Trent Lott, R-Miss., the majority leader, and Tom Daschle,
D-S.D., the minority leader, have been working across party lines
for the past few weeks in an attempt to forge a compromise that
would end a trial quickly and without witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   But with conservatives in both the House and Senate opposed to
short-circuiting a trial, it was not yet clear whether Lott would
be able to sell such a proposal to Republicans, who will caucus for
the first time on either Wednesday or Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The divisions among Republicans were clear on the television
talk shows Sunday as Sen. Slade Gorton, R-Wash., defended a plan he
has drafted along with Sen. Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn., to condense
a trial into a matter of days. The opposite view was expressed by
Sens. Phil Gramm, D-Texas, an influential conservative, and Arlen
Specter, R-Pa., a moderate, who said a trial with witnesses was
needed.
</P>
<P>
   Keenly aware of the fluid situation, senators who appeared on
NBC's ``Meet the Press'' expressed their discomfort with the
spectacle of Clinton appearing in the House of Representatives to
address a joint session of Congress under such a cloud.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it would be unseemly and distracting for the president
to be giving a State of the Union address to Congress while he was
under trial in the Senate,'' said Gorton.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Robert Torricelli, D-N.J., said, ``It's inappropriate to
report on the state of the union as long as the president is under
impeachment, because the state of the union from the perspective of
his administration is unclear.''
</P>
<P>
   And Gramm, recalling the days before the State of the Union
message became an elaborate ceremonial setpiece that allows the
president to set out a new agenda for a national audience, said,
``The president can simply, as presidents did until the era of
television, the president can submit the State of the Union address
in writing.'' He added, ``The president should not be speaking to
Congress when he is under this cloud, under the trial.''
</P>
<P>
   Jim Kennedy, a spokesman for the president, said the White House
would not comment on the calls for a delay. A year ago, Clinton
proceeded with the address just days after the scandal over his
relationship with Monica Lewinsky burst into public. Despite the
scandal, he set the policy agenda for the year with his call to
save a new budget surplus for ensuring the long-term solvency of
the Social Security system, and his public-approval ratings
rebounded.
</P>
<P>
   After midterm elections that gave Democrats five more seats in
the House and failed to produce Republican gains in the Senate,
Republican leaders are now anxious to make their own mark with
issues like Social Security and tax cutting.
</P>
<P>
   But a key question is whether Lott, trying to weave a path
between his party's moderates and conservatives, can persuade
enough Republicans to allow the Senate to dispense with impeachment
expeditiously to make way for a broader agenda.
</P>
<P>
   Lott has been sounding out Republicans on the bipartisan
proposal by Gorton and Lieberman to have an expedited trial with no
witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Under the plan, prosecutors from the House would make the case,
a week from Monday, for Clinton's conviction and removal from
office. The next day the White House would present its defense. On
Wednesday, with William Rehnquist, chief justice of the United
States, presiding, senators would forward questions to the two
sides. On Thursday, the Senate would take a ``test vote'' on
whether the articles of impeachment for perjury and obstruction of
justice, even if proved, rose to a level that demanded the
president's removal of office.
</P>
<P>
   If, as expected, the test did not produce the 67 votes that
would be needed to remove Clinton from office, the trial would not
continue and the Senate could move on to consider censure. That too
is a tricky proposition, with some senators of both parties
opposing censure of the president and others disagreeing sharply
over what the terms of such a measure should be.
</P>
<P>
   While Democrats appear united against Clinton's removal, a
critical question is how the Senate's 55 Republicans divide up.
Senators say that Lott would most likely move forward with the
bipartisan compromise proposal only if a majority of the
Republicans supported it.
</P>
<P>
   The first critical caucus of the Republicans that could make or
break the proposal could come on Wednesday, when senators are sworn
into office, or on Thursday when Senate Republicans meet on their
agenda for the new year. Democrats are holding their own party
caucus Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said he had ``not a clue'' how
Republican sentiment would divide. ``It's pretty hard to get a
handle on this until we meet,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   McConnell said that if the Gorton-Lieberman plan was not
acceptable, another route the Senate could take would be an
expeditious up or down vote on the articles of impeachment
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we have enough testimony to make that decision,'' he
said in an interview. ``There may be others who think we don't. If
the conclusion is we need more testimony, we could do it in closed
session with the transcripts fully released.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But other powerful figures and factions inside the Republican
Party are still arguing for a full trial with an array of
witnesses. Among them are the House Republicans who have been named
to prosecute the case before the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Gramm of Texas, who often holds powerful sway among Senate
Republicans, expressed opposition on ``Meet the Press'' to any
''resolution that lets us reach a judgment without hearing the
facts.''
</P>
<P>
   Gramm said that facts about the president's attempts to cover up
his relationship with Ms. Lewinsky were in dispute. ``We've got to
hear from both sides to do justice,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He dismissed polls showing that Republicans have damaged their
party's standing in the drive to impeach Clinton. ``Following the
constitutional process is the right thing to do,'' he said, ``and I
believe in the end that the people of Texas, wise people, fair
people of Texas, didn't elect me to read those polls.''
</P>
<P>
   Specter, who has spoken out in the past against removing Clinton
from office, said he too thought senators had a duty to hold a
trial, and suggested a ``managed trial with long trial days, 9:30
to 5 as we had at one time in the Philadelphia criminal courts.''
He also called for the president to come forward and testify before
the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate has yet to be suffused with the fierce partisanship
that tore apart the House as it considered impeachment and that may
prove to make the House ungovernable this year.
</P>
<P>
   But some fear the tone in the Senate could change quickly if
impeachment proceedings became protracted. Lieberman, also
appearing on NBC, said the impending State of the Union message was
one reason why the Senate had a ``very short window here to try to
work out a procedure for this trial.'' He also warned, ``If we
don't, we are going to descend, I fear, to the kind of partisan
rancor that characterized the House proceeding.''
</P>
<P>
   Rancor is already evident between Senate Democrats and the House
Republicans selected to prosecute the case, who want to call
witnesses before the Senate whom they never questioned in their own
House proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're acting like this is a high school exam,'' Sen. Patrick
Leahy, D-Vt., said tartly of the House managers in an appearance on
CBS' ``Face the Nation.'' ``They flunked the exam in their body.
They hope to do a make-up exam in the Senate, and that's not going
to happen.''

CHICAGO DIGS OUT, BUT STORM CRIPPLES AIR TRAVEL 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By DIRK JOHNSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ Pummeled by the most ferocious snowstorm in more than
30 years, this high-stepping city, after being slowed to a crawl,
started to come back to life on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 2 feet of snow blanketed the city, left by a storm so
furious that at times on Saturday street plows sat idle in
futility. By Sunday afternoon, however, after an army of city
workers had scraped and swept with a vengeance, the streets became
passable.
</P>
<P>
   Getting in or out of town by air, however, remained problematic.
O'Hare International Airport, the United States' busiest, and
Midway Airport struggled to get back to normal on Sunday after
virtually shutting down on Saturday. There were still plenty of
canceled flights and long delays for travelers returning from the
holidays. Some 400 people had slept on cots and benches inside the
airport on Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, air travel throughout the eastern half of the nation was
disrupted Sunday, as the snow and ice in the Midwest, coupled with
heavy sleet and rain on Sunday morning in the Northeast as the
storm moved eastward, resulted in hundreds of canceled flights and
thousands of disgruntled passengers.
</P>
<P>
   In the New York area, the storm and the ripple effects from the
Midwest stranded or delayed thousands of travelers at Kennedy, La
Guardia and Newark International airports as airlines scratched or
rescheduled flights and threw out their timetables.
</P>
<P>
   With water a foot deep on the JFK Expressway leading to Kennedy
Airport, traffic was halted for more than two hours at
midafternoon, and witnesses told of chaos as riders abandoned
stalled taxis and cars and, with luggage and children in tow,
streamed like refugees for the terminals a mile or two away.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is extremely frustrating,'' Adena Muchnik, 26, of New
York said as she and her husband, David, hobbled along the
roadside, struggling with three suitcases and two small children in
strollers, trying to catch a 3:45 flight to Australia. It was
already 3:15, and the dream was dying. ``If we don't make the
flight to Melbourne, we might be out of a vacation,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The storm, which barreled up from the Gulf Coast on Friday, also
dumped heavy snow on Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Michigan, Minnesota,
Missouri, Nebraska, Ohio and Wisconsin.
</P>
<P>
   The weather was blamed for more than 20 deaths in the Midwest,
including 10 in Illinois. Many were the result of traffic
accidents. A 130-mile stretch of Interstate 65 in Indiana reopened
Sunday after being closed on Saturday, but many counties in the
state still banned unnecessary travel.
</P>
<P>
   ``The roads were like ice,'' said John Rawlings, who spent the
night with 200 other travelers at a church near Lafayette, Ind.,
after his van slid off I-65. ``The wind just picked it up and put
it in the ditch,'' Rawlings told The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   In the Northeast on Sunday, it was rain that turned highways
across the region into running rivers, downed power lines in parts
of Connecticut, caused 200 accidents on the New York Thruway, and
toppled rainfall records in New York's Central Park, where 2.42
inches eclipsed a 1936 mark for the date by more than an inch, and
in Bridgeport, Conn., which had 2.71 inches.
</P>
<P>
   Harsh as it was, the storm might have been much worse if
temperatures, which hovered in the 40s most of the day, had been 10
or 15 degrees lower, and the precipitation had turned to snow,
weather experts said. A meteorological rule of thumb is that every
inch of rain would have been a foot of snow.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would have been a big snowstorm,'' Todd Miner, a
meteorologist with Pennsylvania State University, said. ``As it
was, all the snow was dumped in the Midwest.''
</P>
<P>
   The 22 inches that was dumped in Chicago was the most in one
storm since 1967. Indeed, for all its reputation for tough winter
weather, the city had not had more than a foot of snow from any one
storm since 1978.
</P>
<P>
   And in a city where where almost everything is viewed through
the prism of politics, the storm prompted plenty of parlor talk
about the infamous snowstorm of 1979, a mess that contributed
mightily to Jane Byrne's upset victory of the incumbent mayor,
Michael Bilandic. Bilandic had been regarded by voters as being
indifferent to the suffering of Chicagoans, in particular
neglecting black neighborhoods on the South Side.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Richard M. Daley, running for re-election this year
against Rep. Bobby Rush, made himself highly visible during this
storm, casting himself in news conferences as a general rallying
the troops.
</P>
<P>
   ``This task will be enormous,'' said Daley. ``Please be
patient.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The storm followed a remarkable stretch of weather in Chicago
during the last months of 1998, mild temperatures, brilliant
sunshine and skies that seemed as blue as Lake Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   For now, the blankets of snow have given the city an almost
angelic cast, a look of purity and cleanliness.
</P>
<P>
   ``Man, it's just beautiful,'' said Tom Amenda, 41, a stock
trader.
</P>
<P>
   Amenda and his wife, Mary Shannon, a 38-year-old teacher, had
spent the afternoon shopping, and making snow angles in the yard of
their Wicker Park neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   Struck by how quickly the city's streets had been cleaned,
Amenda expressed gratitude for nature's good timing.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're going to have a blizzard in Chicago,'' said Amenda,
``you want to have it during an election year.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The vast prestige, power and, critics would argue,
arrogance of Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center can be measured
by its physical space.
</P>
<P>
   It is on York Avenue on the Upper East Side and, like many
prestigious New York City hospitals, inconvenient to public
transportation. Many of its hospital floors feel grim and dated,
with harsh lighting and nurses' stations enclosed in Plexiglass.
Its parking lot is dismal, and some waiting areas are about as
welcoming as the average public hospital's.
</P>
<P>
   Historically, Sloan-Kettering has been the place to go for
cancer treatment in New York because of its prestigious doctors,
esteemed reputation for clinical research and the promising drugs
trials it conducts. Ambiance has never been the point.
</P>
<P>
   But lately, curious things have been happening at
Sloan-Kettering. It is building a new ambulatory care center at
53rd Street and Third Avenue, smack next to several subway lines.
The main hospital is undergoing a face lift: peach-toned walls with
still-life paintings are replacing blinding white ones,
sand-colored carpeting is being added and nurses' stations are now
open and accessible. In recent years it also opened a modern,
attractive center for breast cancer patients on East 64th Street,
complete with comfortable furniture and a shop that sells hats,
scarves, jewelry and the like.
</P>
<P>
   And last week, Sloan-Kettering's 72-year-old president, Paul A.
Marks, said he would retire next year, perhaps paving the way for
further changes in the center's way of doing business, which has
nearly ignored the managed-care movement.
</P>
<P>
   This is hardly enlightenment in a vacuum. Cancer is hot in New
York, and across the city the major medical centers are
aggressively attempting to nibble away at Sloan-Kettering's market
share. While this concentration on cancer patients is a nationwide
phenomenon, experts say the new competition is particularly fevered
in New York, where there are already more centers that have the
official designation of the National Cancer Institute _ and its
funding _ than in most other regions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, New York is the hotbed of competition,'' said
Christopher Demby, who runs the Oncology Round Table program for
the Advisory Board, a health care research firm. ``There is action
being taken by every player in the market now.''
</P>
<P>
   Hospitals are building new centers devoted to the disease and
poaching some of the country's biggest names in cancer care _ some
from Sloan-Kettering itself _ to run and staff them. They are
investing in expensive technology, adding all manner of
consumer-friendly fringe benefits like support groups and libraries
to their cancer wards and pouring money into advertising campaigns
that hawk cancer treatments in a way once reserved for innovations
like birthing centers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are here to show that Memorial is no longer the only game
in town,'' said Marilyn Halper, executive director of Beth Israel
Medical Center's gleaming new cancer center, in the Zeckendorf
Tower on Union Square _ a public transport hub for lower Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Carving off one disease and homing in on it is an important
trend in medicine, especially chronic diseases that require
long-term care. Diabetes, for instance, is also getting lots of
attention. But few illnesses have attracted quite the same focus
and investment as cancer.
</P>
<P>
   The reason is largely financial: Cancer is big business. The
increasing numbers of new cases alone make cancer an essential part
of any hospital's business. Experts believe that cancer will soon
overtake cardiovascular disease as the No. 1 killer in America as
the population ages and cardio-care becomes more advanced.
</P>
<P>
   Cancer offers other financial incentives beyond the sheer flow
of cases: The disease is still fairly immune from managed care
penny pinching, while treatment advances have helped to streamline
care. And there is constant excitement in the field: More than 300
cancer drugs are in the pipeline.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the activity involves the opening of outpatient clinics,
which are starting to flourish across the country as new
technologies and changing medical economics allow patients to have
chemotherapy and radiation treatments without staying overnight in
a hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Continuum Health Partners, which runs Beth Israel and St.
Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center, built the new Union Square
out-patient center and beefed up its breast cancer program at St.
Luke's. It has poached several doctors from other far-more
prestigious cancer centers to run many of its programs, and spent
over $400,000 last year on cancer advertising campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   Over at New York University, the medical center has carved off
neuro-oncology as its brightest attraction, investing $10 million
alone in a rare Gamma knife that administers beams of gamma
radiation without surgical incision to the brain, and $2.5 million
more on special MRI machines, which enable doctors to rule out
malignancies without a biopsy. It also lured Dr. Michael Gruber, a
prestigious neuro-oncologist from the University of California in
Los Angeles, to run the unit.
</P>
<P>
   St. Vincent's Hospital, which had almost no profile as a cancer
treatment center, has hired an outside company to build its cancer
clinic. Mount Sinai Medical Center in Manhattan and Montefiore
Medical Center in the Bronx have made similar deals with Dr.
Bernard Salick, the California physician-entrepreneur whose
24-hour-for-profit cancer clinics have raised the customer-service
bar.
</P>
<P>
   Importantly, all of these hospitals and their doctors are well
versed in the ways of managed care, and are in a position to take
the increasing load of patients who are enrolled in HMOs and can
only afford to go to centers that honor them. Sloan-Kettering has
all but shunned the managed care movement, which also can cost a
hospital important drug trial money. ``In order to have enough
patients to do these trials you need a cross section of patients,''
said Joann Schellenbach, a spokeswoman for the American Cancer
Society. ``Not just those who can afford to go to elite
physicians.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   It is almost impossible to track the cancer business market
share _ most of the hospitals guard their numbers more closely than
any privately held company, and many experts think that New York
City's community hospitals are simply getting slices of a growing
market rather than stealing business from Sloan-Kettering.
</P>
<P>
   But since 1996, when Beth Israel opened its Union Square center,
the number of patients seen there has risen to 21,174 from 15,027.
Further, the hospital's in-patient cancer business has grown 12
percent since 1992.
</P>
<P>
   At NYU, new-case growth is similar. In 1993, its department of
neuro-oncology saw five patients. In 1997, that number grew to 275.
And if Salick's success in California is any indication, new cases
at hospitals where he is affiliated should certainly swell this
year.
</P>
<P>
   Salick, whose mere name tends to raise hackles in more
traditional circles, can be credited with helping to push New
York's medical centers toward a greater emphasis on
patient-friendly cancer care.
</P>
<P>
   He began opening for-profit centers in 1986 in California and
expanded to Florida. He says his niche is the 24-hour comprehensive
service that patients can get in his centers, and that his deep
knowledge of managed care, prevalent in California for a decade but
still fairly new to this area, gives him an edge. He also provides
the financing, badly needed by hospitals with dwindling resources,
to get clinics off the ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a highly credible reputation of running very cost
effective facilities,'' Salick said in an interview. ``You have
wonderful hospitals and wonderful doctors in New York but there is
a breakdown in the delivery system. You go to these places at 9 at
night and no one is there. Cancer is a disease that happens to go
on 24 hours a day. All these other hospitals are doing is opening a
center and sticking some doctors in there.''
</P>
<P>
   Some cancer experts have expressed concerns about Salick's
for-profit model, arguing that health care surpluses should go back
into the hospitals that generate them, not in shareholder's
pockets. Others deride his approach as either impractical or
non-threatening. ``Not too many people want radiation at 4 a.m.,''
said Dr. Warren Enker, the associate director of Beth Israel and
St. Luke's cancer center. ``So it's not that great a gimmick.''
</P>
<P>
   But Enker's colleague, Ms. Halper, admits that Salick has
underscored the importance of focusing on customer service. ``The
for-profits have taught us the importance of being
patient-friendly,'' she said. ``This is a service.'' A wig shop,
wooden furniture designed in Vermont and a light-soaked atrium of a
lobby are all part of Beth Israel's efforts in that regard.
</P>
<P>
   And patient friendliness has traditionally been the Achilles
heel of Sloan-Kettering's reputation. Doctors who have worked at
the hospital and some patients who have received care there
describe an imperious and at times cold atmosphere, where waits can
be long and doctors hard to reach.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, warmth wins over clinical reputation. Michael
Berkowitz learned he had lung cancer in 1996. His wife was
pregnant, his life as a successful Wall Street lawyer was thrown
into turmoil and he had to make some decisions about treatment,
fast. First, he went to Beth Israel, then to Sloan-Kettering for a
second opinion. He decided to go with Beth Israel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone says to be cured, you have to go to Sloan because
they have the reputation,'' he said. While he was impressed with
the doctors, he found the hospital to be ``a scary and
institutional place,'' he said. ``It feels big, and you feel small.
I felt that I did not have the same personal connection as I did to
the Beth Israel doctors.''
</P>
<P>
   Some former Sloan-Kettering physicians say a lack of warmth
toward patients was an unfortunate byproduct of working in a highly
elite institution. ``Sloan-Kettering is one of the institutions
that has an exceedingly cumbersome administration,'' said Enker,
who left in 1995 for Beth Israel.
</P>
<P>
   ``The surgeons there are very dedicated to their patients,''
Enker added. ``But it is a very busy environment. You can't see
hundreds of patients each year and not have patients feel rushed.
And I hear repeated complaints that the medical oncologists are
lacking in compassion and part of the arrogance becomes `Look I am
the expert, you came to me for my opinion so listen to me or you're
dismissed.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Sloan-Kettering doctors and administrators are not unaware of
their reputation. But they also argue that it is more myth than
reality. ``There is a misperception that we are an ivory tower,''
said Dr. James B. Dougherty, deputy physician in chief of clinical
affairs at Sloan-Kettering. ``This is a very patient-centered
environment.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Dougherty and his colleagues have made
customer-friendly cancer care a focus in recent years, even
studying the hospitality industry for clues, and have adopted
things like a more room-service style approach to patient meals as
a result. Getting patients out of the hospital and into its new
200,000-square-foot out-patient center on 53rd Street, where care
will be more streamlined, is a goal.
</P>
<P>
   Just as universities and corporations go after big names to
attract new business, so do medical centers. Cancer is no
exception. In the last few years, Sloan-Kettering has lost several
doctors to various centers, including four to Beth Israel alone.
St. Luke's poached Dr. Alison Estabrook, now head of its breast
center, from Columbia Presbyterian. In addition to Gruber, NYU
recently recruited Dr. Patrick Kelly from the Mayo Clinic and
several prominent doctors from other states. In turn, Beth Israel
took three doctors from NYU.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best way to go after patients is through building your
talent base,'' said Uwe Reinhardt, a health economist at Princeton
University. What is more, they attract drug companies and other
institutions needed to get drug trials going, which are another
major attraction for critically ill patients.
</P>
<P>
   Sloan-Kettering is not just content to spiff up its New York
City hospital. It is encroaching on the cancer business of some
regional hospitals by opening satellite centers elsewhere that
enable patients to get things like chemo and radiation without
having the trek into Manhattan. There is one in Long Island, two in
New Jersey and one in the suburbs just north of New York City, and
plans for more, Dougherty said.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, hospitals in Long Island are not cheering. ``There is
considerable concern in Suffolk County over Sloan-Kettering's
plans,'' said Demby of the oncology round table. ``And what that
will mean to local facilities.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the cancer war promises to expand outside the immediate
region, experts say. ``Cancer is to the 1990s what heart disease
was to the 1970s,'' said Gruber of NYU. ``It puts a center on the
map, and that begets business.''

about ``Wanting, Fearing and Having a Face-Lift,'' was here
recently in the middle of a multicity tour promoting the book.
 &HT;    What makes San Francisco special in the field of face-fixing is
the particular popularity of Botox (poison injected into wrinkles

Boston than Los Angeles,'' said Kron. ``Women here want to look
natural. But what is natural?''
 &HT;    Kron, 70, has had two face-lifts and foresees the possibility of
one more. ``There is no natural. We do our hair, we pluck our
eyebrows. If you never cut your hair or wash your face, maybe
that's natural. But I don't know what natural is.''

CLINTON PROPOSES PARTIAL FUNDING OF LONG-TERM CARE FOR ELDERLY 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By ROBERT PEAR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton will announce a $6 billion
package of tax and budget proposals on Monday to help provide
long-term care for people with chronic illnesses or disabilities,
administration officials said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The proposals represent the most ambitious effort to deal with
the long-term care needs of the elderly since the collapse of
Clinton's plan to guarantee health insurance for all Americans in
1994.
</P>
<P>
   The core of the initiative is a proposal to give a tax credit of
$1,000 a year to people who need long-term care, whether at home or
in an institution. The tax credit would also be available, in some
cases, to people who care for relatives with conditions like
Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, stroke and traumatic
brain injuries.
</P>
<P>
   The White House said that the tax credit, if approved by
Congress, would help 2 million people, at a cost of $5.5 billion,
from 2000 to 2004.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials said the president would probably not
specify now how he intended to pay for the initiative, but would
probably ask Congress to cover the cost by eliminating several
corporate tax breaks. In any event, they said, Clinton will not dip
into the anticipated budget surplus, which he has said should be
reserved for Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   Ari Fleischer, a spokesman for Republicans on the House Ways and
Means Committee, said the proposed tax credit for long-term care
was ``a good idea that has a potential to be enacted into law.'' It
was, he said, part of the House Republican manifesto, the so-called
Contract With America, in 1994 and 1995.
</P>
<P>
   But Fleischer said that Republicans and Democrats alike had in
the past resisted some of Clinton's proposals for business tax
increases. The long-term care changes would have a better chance of
approval if they were not linked to tax increases, Fleischer said.
</P>
<P>
   The health initiative is to be included in the budget that
Clinton sends to Congress later this month. It responds to a
significant need, administration officials say, pointing out that 5
million Americans need long-term care because of illness or
disability, and that the need will grow with the aging of the
population.
</P>
<P>
   The president's proposals would encourage and reward people who
provide informal, unpaid care to spouses and parents. Many of these
caregivers are themselves over the age of 60.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials cited the plan, which has been in the
works since the summer, as evidence that the president was still
able to focus on the needs of the American people, despite his
impeachment by the House of Representatives on Dec. 19.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this helps on that front, I'm happy,'' said an
administration official asked about any connection between Monday's
planned announcement and the impeachment proceedings, ``but that's
not the rationale for it.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Budget documents show that Clinton's initiative also includes
these proposals:
</P>
<P>
   _ The federal government would provide $125 million a year to
the states _ $625 million over the five years covered by the
initiative _ to assist families caring for relatives with serious
illnesses or disabilities. The money would pay for information,
training and counseling, as well as the occasional services of a
home health aide or personal attendant, so that the regular
caregiver could get out of the home for a few hours a week. About
250,000 families could be assisted under this program.
</P>
<P>
   _ Medicare officials would disseminate information to all 39
million beneficiaries emphasizing that most long-term care is not
covered by Medicare, the federal health insurance program for the
elderly and disabled. Surveys of the elderly have found that nearly
60 percent of them do not realize Medicare's limitations. The
education campaign would cost $10 million.
</P>
<P>
   _ The federal Office of Personnel Management would make private
long-term care insurance available to federal employees and
retirees, their parents and certain in-laws at negotiated group
rates. The government would not pay the premiums, but would
negotiate the rates with a single insurer or ``a very small number
of carriers.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House estimates that 300,000 people would buy
insurance under this arrangement. Because of the group rates, it
says, premiums would be 15 percent to 20 percent lower than the
cost of individual long-term care policies. The government would
insist on certain minimum benefits and a cost-of-living allowance,
to protect benefits against inflation. The administrative costs to
the federal government would be $15 million over five years.
</P>
<P>
   Joshua M. Wiener, an expert on long-term care at the Urban
Institute, a research and policy center, welcomed the president's
proposals. ``It's good to see some recognition of this issue,'' he
said. ``In the debate about Social Security and Medicare, we've
almost totally forgotten the third concern about retirement
security _ the need for long-term care.''
</P>
<P>
   But Wiener said the tax credit would be of little help to people
with incomes so low that they did not pay federal income taxes.
``You have to pay some taxes to qualify,'' he said, ``and 40
percent of the elderly pay no income taxes at all, primarily
because substantial amounts of Social Security are not counted as
income for tax purposes.''
</P>
<P>
   And although a $1,000 credit would be valuable, many people with
chronic illnesses and disabilities require home-care services
costing tens of thousands of dollars a year, experts said.
</P>
<P>
   The administration says that three-fourths of the people who
would get the proposed credit would be spouses or other relatives
of people needing long-term care.
</P>
<P>
   Under the administration proposal, a person could qualify for
the tax credit if he or she was unable to perform three or more
basic tasks of everyday life. These ``activities of daily living''
include bathing, dressing, eating, using a toilet and getting in
and out of a bed or a chair. The person's impairments would have to
be certified by a doctor.
</P>
<P>
   Alternatively, the family of a person needing long-term care
could qualify for the tax credit if the family provided such care
to a close relative who lived with the family and who had annual
gross income of less than $8,100.
</P>
<P>
   The tax credit would be available, in some cases, to parents
caring for children with severe disabilities. The rate of children
living with handicaps has increased in recent years, in part
because of doctors' success in saving premature, sick and disabled
newborns.
</P>
<P>
   The administration says the tax credit would benefit 1.2 million
elderly people, 250,000 children and 550,000 nonelderly adults.
</P>
<P>
   The full tax credit would be available to couples with incomes
up to $110,000 a year, but would be gradually reduced for more
affluent couples and would be eliminated for those with incomes
over $130,000 a year. The credit would be phased out for
individuals with incomes from $75,000 to $95,000.
</P>
<P>
   In a description of the proposal, the White House says: ``The
flat $1,000 credit would be given on the basis of a certified need
for long-term care, rather than expenses for long-term care. This
means that families and people with chronic illness or disability
do not have to collect and submit receipts for paid home health
care'' or other expenses.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials said the proposals recognized the value
and costs of informal, unpaid long-term care provided by relatives.
If, for example, a man has a stroke and his wife takes time off
from work to care for him, she would not necessarily have a receipt
to show her reduced hours of work or the time spent bathing and
feeding her husband. But the family might qualify for the tax
credit.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Jocelyn Crane Griffin, a research zoologist who studied the
behavioral patterns of tropical species, died on Dec. 16 at Emerson
Hospital in Concord, Mass. She was 89 and lived in Lexington, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Griffin spent decades in exotic places investigating exotic
creatures. She concentrated on the likes of jumping spiders,
praying mantises, butterflies and fiddler crabs.
</P>
<P>
   The ways of the fiddler crab were a mystery until Mrs. Griffin
discovered why and how it could change color like a chameleon, keep
track of time and feed furiously after being frustrated in combat
or at the mating game. Her research from many voyages around the
globe resulted in an authoritative monograph, ``Fiddler Crabs of
the World.''
</P>
<P>
   She spent her scientific career as an ethologist with the New
York Zoological Society, now the Wildlife Conservation Society. She
retired 30 years ago as director of the William Beebe Tropical
Research Station, a branch of the society in Trinidad.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Griffin then delved into art history and, in 1991, received
a doctorate in the field at the Institute of Fine Arts of New York
University. Among her areas of specialty was the evolution of human
communicative hand gestures.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Griffin, a St. Louis native, graduated from Smith College
in 1930. She joined the staff of the department of tropical
research at the Zoological Society when the department was directed
by its founder, the naturalist, ornithologist and author William
Beebe. She became a research zoologist in 1942 and assistant
director of the department 10 years later.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Griffin is survived by her husband of 35 years, Donald
Griffin, who retired as a scientist from Rockefeller University.

MIDWEST SNOWS SEND SHIVERS THROUGH NEW YORK REGION 
 (DW)
</HEADLINE>
  By ROBERT D. McFADDEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The New York region's first major storm of the winter
churned out of the snowbound Midwest Sunday with a deluge of
lashing sleet and record-setting rains that disrupted air travel,
flooded roads and whole neighborhoods and caused hundreds of
traffic accidents, including a 50-car pileup in Queens.
</P>
<P>
   No deaths or serious injuries were reported, although scores
were hurt in collisions on icy roadways. But there was widespread
damage in flooded homes, including basements in a 30-block area of
the Springfield Gardens section of Queens, where water rose
waist-high and some residents had to be evacuated to shelters.
</P>
<P>
   For most who did not have to work or travel, it was a day to
stay indoors, to dismantle the holiday trappings, read a book or
sit by a window and take in the show: the clouds swelling like dark
bruises, the rain falling in silver cataracts, mists drifting
against glistening streets or stark suburban woods.
</P>
<P>
   But for those determined to get somewhere, it was hellish.
Coming at the end of the long holiday weekend, the storm _ and the
ripple effects of a blizzard that paralyzed airports across the
Midwest _ stranded or delayed thousands of travelers at Kennedy, La
Guardia and Newark International Airports as airlines scratched or
rescheduled flights and threw out their timetables.
</P>
<P>
   With water a foot deep on the expressway leading to Kennedy
Airport, traffic was halted for more than two hours at
midafternoon, and witnesses told of chaos as riders abandoned
stalled taxis and cars and, with luggage and children in tow,
streamed like refugees for the terminals a mile or two away.

   ``This is extremely frustrating,'' Adena Muchnik, 26, of
Brooklyn, said as she and her husband, David, hobbled along the
roadside, struggling with three suitcases and two small children in
strollers, trying to catch a 3:45 flight to Australia. It was
already 3:15, and the dream was dying. ``If we don't make the
flight to Melbourne, we might be out of a vacation.''
</P>
<P>
   The rain, which fell hard for six hours in the morning and early
afternoon, turned highways across the region into running rivers,
downed power lines in parts of Connecticut, caused 200 accidents on
the New York Thruway, and toppled rainfall records in Central Park,
where 2.42 inches eclipsed a 1936 mark for the date by more than an
inch, and in Bridgeport, Conn., which had 2.71 inches.
</P>
<P>
   Even more rain, though no records, fell in parts of New Jersey,
the National Weather Service reported: 3.43 in Chatham in Morris
County, 4.23 inches in Ocean Grove, in Monmouth County; 4.42 inches
in Middlebush, in Somerset County, and an astounding 5.78 inches in
the Morris County community of Morris Plains.
</P>
<P>
   Harsh as it was, the storm might have been much worse if
temperatures, which hovered in the 40's most of the day, had been
10 or 15 degrees lower, and the precipitation had turned to snow,
weather experts said. A meteorological rule of thumb is that every
inch of rain would have been a foot of snow.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would have been a big snowstorm,'' Todd Miner, a
meteorologist with Pennsylvania State University, said. ``As it
was, all the snow was dumped in the Midwest.''
</P>
<P>
   The powerful winter storm over the weekend struck Chicago with
22 inches of snow, and left deep drifts from Nebraska and Iowa to
Michigan and Ohio, shutting down airports and stranding hundreds of
thousands of travelers.

 Buzzwords Aid Communication, Confuse the Situation  &HT;       
 By Ilana DeBare 
 &HT;     c. 1998 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
It's 1999. Time to ramp up for a paradigm shift. Take ownership of
your core competencies, envision a win-win situation, and you'll
find yourself best of breed into the next millennium.
</P>
<P>
   Translation?
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Make some New Year's resolutions and have a good year! &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR;  Across America, companies and employees are framing their
own futures in buzzword-laden language that is frighteningly
similar to that first paragraph.
</P>
<P>
   1998 produced a bumper crop of business buzzwords. When the
economy grew, buzzwords grew, too. When the economy faltered a bit,
the buzzwords kept growing.
</P>
<P>
   By now, almost anyone in the working world has his or her own
list of the Top 10 Most-Hated Buzzwords.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe yours includes ``synergy.'' Or ``world-class.'' Or
``thinking outside the box.''
</P>
<P>
   Tom Scott, a software developer in Southern California, really
hates ``proactive.'' ``This is a word for people who aren't active
enough to look in the &LR;   &LR; dictionary,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And Minneapolis software engineer Laura Thurston has a grudge
against use of the term ``resources'' to refer to human beings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hear it from salespeople who tell clients they'll send a
resource to fix their computer,'' Thurston said. ``They don't send
technicians, they send `resources.' My skills are resources _ I
personally am not one.''
</P>
<P>
   People use buzzwords for a variety of reasons _ some good, some
bad.
</P>
<P>
   ``People use technical buzzwords to feel like they fit in,''
said Benjamin Yoskovitz, author of ``The Buzzword Bingo Book.''
``Managers throw them out there so they sound like they know what
they're talking about, even if they don't.''
</P>
<P>
   ``On the positive side, they're shorthand for things that would
take a long time to explain otherwise,'' said Scott Adams, creator
of the comic strip ``Dilbert,'' which someday may be studied by
historians as a satirical record of 1990s business buzzwords.
</P>
<P>
   ``They allow you to capture amorphous things that you might have
trouble explaining, like saying `I've been Dilbertized.'''
</P>
<P>
   For every instance that a buzzword clarifies an idea, though,
there are probably three other times that buzzwords muddy things
up.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big problem with buzzwords is that rather than clarifying
meaning, they obscure it,'' said Daniel Levine, editor of the
online business magazine Disgruntled. ``Sometimes they're used to
create a code for people who are `in the club.' Other times,
there's an Orwellian component where black becomes white.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes a buzzword sounds brilliant the first time you hear
it. Then, by the end of the week, you've heard it often enough to
gag.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like a Top 40 song,'' said Richard Moran, a partner at
Andersen Consulting in San Francisco and author of the book ``Fear
No Yellow Stickies.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so good the first time you hear it, but by Labor Day you
want to kill the next DJ who plays it.''
</P>
<P>
   For those of you fed up with the buzzwords of 1998, take heart:
They probably won't be around forever.
</P>
<P>
   Take the prefix ``cyber.''
</P>
<P>
   A few years ago, everyone was talking about cyber-everything:
cybervision, cybercash, cybersex.
</P>
<P>
   Now cyber has faded is gone  &LR; _ but the prefix ``e'' is in. As
in: e-mail, E-Trade, eToys, e-commerce. Why? Certainly Wall
Street's infatuation with anything Internet-related has fed the
spread of e-jargon.
</P>
<P>
   `` `E-' just means, `Give me more multiple on my stock price,'''
said Adams.
</P>
<P>
   To help you ease into the New Year, here are some 1998 buzzwords
that many people would be very happy never to hear again in 1999:
</P>
<P>
   _ &UR; Solutions.  &LR; No one in Silicon Valley sells computers or
software anymore. They're all too busy providing ``business process
solutions'' or ``global enterprise solutions.''
</P>
<P>
   I suppose we didn't really bomb Iraq last month; we initiated a
``recalcitrant dictator solution.''
</P>
<P>
   Me? I used to be a newspaper reporter. But these days, I guess
I'm a provider of ``business information solutions.''
</P>
<P>
   _ &UR; Content provider &LR; . On the other hand, maybe I'm a content
provider.
</P>
<P>
   Along with Shakespeare, Kenneth Starr, Dear Abby, J.S. Bach,
Madonna, Michelangelo, eToys, Larry Flynt, Mrs. Quong's
fourth-grade class, and the National Science Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   Have any universities replaced their English, art, philosophy
and music departments yet with a ``Department of Content Studies''?
</P>
<P>
   _ &UR; Merger of equals.  &LR; This phrase was touted a lot to put a nice
gloss on 1998's flood of corporate acquisitions. But some equals
are more equal than others. Like, for instance, NationsBank and
Bank of America. 'Nuff said?
</P>
<P>
   _ &UR; Synergy. &LR;  This might win the prize for most universally hated
buzzword of 1998. Webster's Collegiate Dictionary defines it simply
as ``combined action or operation.''
</P>
<P>
   But the business world uses it as a way to promise a lot more
than that _ to promise something like 1+150 zillion.
</P>
<P>
   Want to merge Don's Ski Hut with Lockheed Martin? Tell people it
makes sense because of synergy. They'll nod and look impressed ...
until big losses next year show that most people buying a pair of
cross-country skis can't be easily sold on an F-22 fighter plane as
well.
</P>
<P>
   _ &UR; Ramp up. &LR;  As in: We're ramping up for the next round of widget
production. We're ramping up for the annual sales meeting. We're
ramping up for house-training that new Labrador puppy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have `ramped up' so many things this year that we've
installed a trailer hitch in the conference room,'' said Rick
Pflugradt, director of marketing and administration at ProTemps, a
staffing firm in Oakland.
</P>
<P>
   _ &UR; Paradigm shift.  &LR; Physicist Thomas Kuhn invented the term
``paradigm shift` more than 25 years ago to describe major shifts
in scientific thinking that altered the way people viewed the
universe. Now companies use ``paradigm shift'' to describe
everything from a software upgrade to a new way of filing expense
reports.
</P>
<P>
   _ &UR; Core competencies.  &LR; Whatever happened to good old ``skills''?
</P>
<P>
   Mark Miller, an engineer at Tut Systems in Pleasant Hill, got so
sick of this phrase that he coined a counter-buzzword: Core
incompetencies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am working on raising my core incompetencies,'' Miller said.
``If I screw up enough, no one will ask me to do anything for them
anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   _ &UR; Downsizing, rightsizing and smartsizing.  &LR; These euphemisms for
laying people off have been around for quite a while, but they
don't seem to go away. Some jaded layoff victims have added another
phrase: After downsizing, rightsizing and smartsizing comes
capsizing.
</P>
<P>
   Some firms try to sugar-coat layoffs by calling them
``decruitment.'' Or there are the two new terms heard in 1998 by
outplacement consultant John Challenger _ ``deverticalization''
(i.e., getting rid of all those vertical layers of middle
management) and ``simplification initiative.''
</P>
<P>
   ``One company called its layoffs ``Project Simplify,''
Challenger said. ``Another said it would have a `strategic review
of its strategies.'''
</P>
<P>
   _ &UR; Empowerment.  &LR; Companies that genuinely treat their employees
well don't have to talk about ``empowering'' anyone. If your firm
is talking about empowering you, watch out: It may be code for
giving you lots of responsibility over completely trivial things.
</P>
<P>
   _ &UR; Mindshare. &LR;  Companies now jockey to win consumer mindshare
rather than brand recognition. PR firms promise to increase
mindshare rather than popularity for political candidates.
</P>
<P>
   It may only be a matter of time until sixth-grade teachers start
hollering, ``Class, sit down and give me your complete mindshare!''
</P>
<P>
   _ &UR; Associates. &LR;  A growing number of firms use the term
``associates'' rather than ``employees'' to refer to low-paid staff
such as burger flippers, room cleaners and sales clerks. Is the
theory that, if you give people a snazzy enough job title, they
won't mind being paid $6 an hour?
</P>
<P>
   _ &UR; Thinking outside the box. &LR;  I can't help it: This one always
makes me think of the cat box. And in my house at least, there's a
fair scattering of litter granules and sometimes even kitty
droppings outside the box as well as inside.
</P>
<P>
   _ &UR; Into the next century. &LR;  Impress your audience by telling them
that your new product will dominate the market ``into the next
century.''
</P>
<P>
   Or go even further and say it will be the market leader ``into
the next millennium.''
</P>
<P>
   Does it matter that the next century/millennium is now only 12
months away? And that your product will be obsolete long before
your driver's license expires?
</P>
<P>
   Nah. The audience probably isn't even listening to a word you
say. That intent look on their faces comes from thinking about
which freeway to take home, and whether to get takeout pizza or
Chinese.
</P>
<P>
   _ &UR; Situation.  &LR; This means ``problem.'' As in, ``Uh, Jeff, we've
got a situation developing here.''
</P>
<P>
   _ &UR; Action item.  &LR; This can also mean ``problem.''
</P>
<P>
   _ &UR; Red flag.  &LR; This can mean ``problem'' too.
</P>
<P>
   It's immensely relieving to know that American business is
running so smoothly _ no problems, just a few situations, action
items and red flags.
</P>
<P>
   And a lot of buzzwords.

 `Dynamic' Employee Is Manic  &HT;       
 By Ilana DeBare  
 c. 1998 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; Question: &LR;  I'm president of the board of directors of a small &LR; 
 &LR; nonprofit. The problem is our highest-level paid employee. He's &LR; 
 &LR; very good at his actual job, energetic, full of ideas and &LR; 
 &LR; charismatic. He's perceived as dynamic. But what he is, it's &LR; 
 &LR; clear to me, is manic. He frequently commits our organization &LR;   &LR; to
big expensive projects without proper authorization. Now &LR;   &LR; he's
pushing more costly new ideas, even though we are &LR;   &LR; financially
strapped and can't afford them. If it were up to &LR;   &LR; me, I'd put him
on notice that his job is at stake if there are &LR;   &LR; any more
shenanigans. But the other board members think he &LR;   &LR; walks on water.
And our board turns over every year, so people &LR;   &LR; aren't aware of
the problems he created in the past. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Answer: &LR;  It's not unusual for the board and the CEO of a
nonprofit to occasionally see things differently. That tension can
be a good thing _ like checks and balances in government.
</P>
<P>
   ``Small, new organizations need a brilliant, driven person to
lead them,'' said Jan Masaoka, executive director of The Support
Center for Nonprofit Management in San Francisco. ``But brilliant,
driven people sometimes are impractical. So one good role that a
board can play is to be the practical side.''
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to tell from your brief summary whether this staff
person's initiatives are really threatening the future of the
organization or whether he's just a bit more entrepreneurial and
risk-tolerant than you are.
</P>
<P>
   Let's assume he's turned a deaf ear to your concerns and that
he's really about to send the organization down the tubes.
</P>
<P>
   You need to do your best to convey your worries to your fellow
board members. Sit down with them one on one: Educate them. Lobby
them. Marshal the facts, and make as strong a case as possible for
why they should rein in this otherwise-successful executive.
</P>
<P>
   What if your colleagues still think he can do no wrong?
</P>
<P>
   There isn't much more you can do right now. But in the long run,
you can try to develop a more independent, critical minded board by
lobbying for longer board terms.
</P>
<P>
   One-year terms for nonprofit board members are extremely
unusual. It's more common for board members to serve for three-year
terms so that they will have enough time to develop a critical
understanding of their organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the entire board turns over every year, they're failing to
fulfill part of their governance function,'' said Matthew O'Grady,
associate director of The Management Center, a nonprofit consulting
group in San Francisco. ``Even if you can get just a few board
members to stick around for three or four years, you would increase
the institutional memory.''
</P>

e-mail or fax: Call (415) 541-9000 or contact  &LR; boardcafe(AT

and pamphlets aimed at board members: Call (800) 883-6262 or go to &LR;

</P>
<P>
   Show Me the Money
</P>
<P>
   Q: Recently I left my job at a state agency. Due to state
accounting procedures, my final check was not issued until November
18 and was short two days' pay. It is now late December and I am
still waiting for that two-day check. Isn't it illegal to make
employees wait this long? And don't state labor laws apply to
government workers?
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR;  A: The California Labor Code requires private-sector
employers to pay final wages to departing workers on their last day
of work or within 72 hours of the time they stop work, depending on
whether the worker gave advance notice of quitting.
</P>
<P>
   And employers who don't do this can face penalties of up to one
day's pay for every day that final wages are late.
</P>
<P>
   But the labor code doesn't apply to state and local government
agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Your situation is instead covered by federal law, which isn't
nearly as helpful to employees in your position.
</P>
<P>
   ``Federal law says the employer must pay people at the normal
time that their paycheck would be due,'' said George Friday,
regional administrator for the U.S. Department of Labor's wage and
hour division. ``If the employer goes past that, it's a violation
of the law.''
</P>
<P>
   But there are no penalties for late payment under federal law.
</P>
<P>
   And U.S. labor officials can only force your employer to pay you
the equivalent of federal minimum wage, or $5.15 an hour.
</P>
<P>
   So let's say you were earning $10 an hour at your job, and
putting in eight-hour days. You should have gotten $160 for those
two days of work. But the Department of Labor can only order your
employer to pay $5.15 an hour, which would come to $62.40.
</P>
<P>
   What should you do? Start by sending one more request for
payment in writing to your old employer. If that doesn't work, file
a wage claim with the Department of Labor at (415) 744-5590.
</P>
<P>
   That will get you at least some of your money. It might even get
you all of it, by bringing this mess-up onto the radar screen of
higher-ups at the agency.
</P>
<P>
   If the federal wage claim process doesn't get you everything
you're owed, Friday said, you could also file a small claims suit
to recover the difference between minimum wage and your actual rate
of pay.
</P>
<P>

 AirTouch May Be Close to Merger  &HT;       
 By Deborah Solomon 
 &HT;     c. 1998 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
AirTouch Communications Inc. is reportedly nearing a $45 billion
merger agreement with Bell Atlantic Corp., the nation's largest
telephone company, according to executives close to the companies.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco's AirTouch, the nation's second-largest wireless
phone carrier, could be acquired in a deal that could be announced
as early as Monday, the New York Times reported last night.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts familiar with both companies said they had heard
similar rumors of a $45 billion stock takeover of AirTouch.
</P>
<P>
   If the deal goes through, it would be among the 10 largest
mergers in history. AirTouch's stock rose $3.06 to $72.44 on news
of the rumored takeover. Bell Atlantic's stock fell $3.50 to $54.
</P>
<P>
   Industry watchers say the pairing would give Bell Atlantic a
better chance at competing for wireless customers against AT&AMP;T
Corp. and Sprint Corp. while giving AirTouch access to more
customers and a bigger national footprint.
</P>
<P>
   Bell Atlantic offers limited wireless phone service on the East
Coast to about 5 million subscribers, but it has been losing
customers to AT&AMP;T, which offers a single rate nationwide. AirTouch,
with its 35 million customers worldwide, would give Bell Atlantic
the boost it needs to compete across the country and
internationally, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This makes a lot of sense,'' said Michael Balhoff, managing
director of the telecom group at Legg Mason Wood Walker in
Baltimore. ``Bell Atlantic aspires to be a national player, and the
combination with AirTouch strengthens its wireless capabilities.''
</P>
<P>
   AirTouch demonstrated its desire to be a national player earlier
this year when it bought US West Media Group, a wireless company,
for $5.7 billion. That purchase made AirTouch the No.2 wireless
carrier behind AT&AMP;T Corp.
</P>
<P>
   It also made AirTouch a more appealing takeover target.
</P>
<P>
   ``AirTouch has been an attractive property for long time,'' said
Jeffrey Kagan, an Atlanta telecom analyst. ``(AirTouch CEO) Sam
Ginn has built a great organization and was just waiting for an
offer he couldn't refuse.''
</P>
<P>
   Because it doesn't currently offer nationwide service, Bell
Atlantic has been losing customers who travel, he said. ``The only
way to combat that is to either expand your footprint or strike up
more roaming agreements. Companies lose money on roaming
agreements, so it makes sense to get a bigger footprint.''
</P>
<P>
   Bell Atlantic tried to expand its reach this summer when it
announced a $64 billion merger with GTE Corp. The deal, which is
still pending antitrust approval, would allow the companies to
offer one-stop-shopping for communications needs such as local,
long-distance, data and wireless services.
</P>
<P>
   Bell Atlantic is also likely to become the first Baby Bell
allowed to offer long-distance service in its own territory.
</P>
<P>
   Rumors of an AirTouch/Bell Atlantic merger have been circulating
for months, and the two companies are not strangers. They both own
50 percent of PrimeCo Personal Communications, a digital wireless
phone venture in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   That partnership may be another reason why Bell Atlantic is
interested in AirTouch.
</P>
<P>
   When Bell Atlantic announced the merger with GTE, there was talk
that the Baby Bell would have to sell its stake in PrimeCo because
of a noncompetitive clause with AirTouch. GTE is an AirTouch
competitor. If an AirTouch/Bell Atlantic deal goes through,
however, neither company would have to shed its lucrative PrimeCo
investment.
</P>
<P>
   But analysts said regulators would probably require Bell
Atlantic to divest some of its interests before approving any
merger. And several questioned whether regulators, who are growing
increasingly critical of corporate megamergers, would look
favorably upon two simultaneous, huge deals by Bell Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm hard pressed to remember two mergers of this size at the
same time with the same company,'' Balhoff said.
</P>
<P>
   But he quickly added that for a company to survive today, it
needs to be a national player. The addition of GTE and AirTouch
will help Bell Atlantic compete against bigger players.
</P>
<P>
   ``Regulators have been bent out of shape over the megamergers
out there, but we've already got national players in MCI WorldCom,
AT&AMP;T and Sprint,'' Balhoff said. ``Most of these regional players
realize they have got to be national if they are going to be among
the major players in the future. It's not like we're putting
together the old Bell system.''
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 2 of AIRTOUCH () &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  Bell Atlantic and other companies want to be able to compete on a
national level because the telecom industry is extremely lucrative.
Wireless is a big part of that as demand for the service soars and
technology improves.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wireless is a key component for success for service providers
and Bell Atlantic wants to be a leader,'' Kagan said. ``Expanding
their geographic footprint, customer base and revenues is a big
step in that direction.''

   TOKYO _ Room 529 in the National Assembly Building in South
Korea has an inconspicuous brown door that is usually locked, but a
growing mystery about what goes on inside has set off a ferocious
political dispute and raised questions about whether Korea's spies
are running out of control.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute erupted Wednesday when an opposition member of the
National Assembly announced that he had information from a source
he could not disclose that the national spy agency was using Room
529 as a base to conduct surveillance on members of the assembly.
That announcement set off a furor, with opposition members
conducting a round-the-clock sit-in outside the door, which had not
particularly attracted attention before.
</P>
<P>
   On New Year's Eve, the increasingly frustrated opposition
legislators broke the lock and forced their way in, seizing 59
documents that they say show that the room was used by the spy
agency, the Agency for National Security Planning, to monitor
politicians in the national legislature and the political process.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a clear violation of the law,'' said Lee Shin-bom, the
member of the National Assembly who first asserted that Room 529
was a surveillance center. ``This is a serious challenge to Korean
freedom of speech.''
</P>
<P>
   The accusations are particularly resonant in South Korea, a
young democracy where the spy agency _ formerly known as the Korean
Central Intelligence Agency _ operated for decades beyond any law.
President Kim Dae-jung, a former dissident whom the former agency
had tried to kill, has vowed to stop the new agency from domestic
spying.
</P>
<P>
   Kim has been hailed for his efforts to bring conciliation at
home and across East Asia. But his critics say that having
inherited a repressive apparatus, he decided not to dismantle it
and instead redirected it to monitor and intimidate his rivals.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Kim has said nothing about the latest uproar, but his
aides suggested that Room 529 was being used merely for liaison
work between the National Assembly and the Agency for National
Security Planning. Some of the documents supposedly showing
surveillance were actually just summaries of news articles, the
aides said, and they denounced the opposition members for breaking
into an office.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a totally illegal act,'' Park Jie-won, president Kim's
chief spokesman, said of the break-in.
</P>
<P>
   There is no evidence directly linking Kim or the Blue House _
the presidential office and mansion _ to the spying on politicians.
Indeed, some of the seized documents, 12 of which were released,
suggest that the Agency for National Security Planning was
gathering intelligence on members of the governing party as well as
on the opposition _ and that it was concerned less with Kim than
with protecting its own institutional hide from criticism by
politicians of all stripes.
</P>
<P>
   Opposition politicians called on the agency's director, Lee
Jong-chan, to step down, and on Kim, who appointed the director, to
apologize to the nation. Lee took the offensive, though, and the
agency filed a complaint with prosecutors accusing dozens of
opposition members of the National Assembly of breaking and
entering.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors have been investigating the incident, even taking
fingerprints on the door to determine who, precisely, broke the
lock. Under Korean law, members of the National Assembly can be
indicted but cannot be arrested while the assembly is in session,
unless a majority of the members approve the arrests.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The governing party has the votes to do that, but such a move
would lead to a total breakdown of political cooperation in South
Korea. The party, the National Congress for New Politics, did not
say whether it might go as far as that, but a party spokesman, Yoon
Ho-joong, said Sunday, ``Under no circumstances can we accept an
act of breaking and entering a place that houses national
secrets.''
</P>
<P>
   Park Shin-il, a spokesman for the opposition Grand National
Party, said that the documents from Room 529 clearly show that the
people inside were not just liaison officers but that they were
running an intelligence-gathering network in the National Assembly.

   JACKSONVILLE, Fla. _ The New England Patriots' owner, Robert
Kraft, is undecided about whether to keep coach Pete Carroll,
according to a high-ranking team official.
</P>
<P>
   In their 25-10 loss to the Jaguars on Sunday in an American
Football Conference playoff game, the Patriots were plagued by
problems that they have faced all year, including injuries and a
lack of discipline on the field.
</P>
<P>
   There is also some question whether Carroll has the full support
of the players. Some said privately after Sunday's loss that
Carroll needed to be more of a disciplinarian.
</P>
<P>
   Kraft would not discuss in detail his thoughts on whether he
would keep Carroll, though he said the high number of key Patriot
injuries should be a factor in any decision about the coach's
future.
</P>
<P>
   Kraft added that Carroll and his staff would be evaluated in the
coming days.

MERLE E. FRAMPTON, ADVOCATE FOR VISUALLY IMPAIRED, DIES AT 95  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  By ENID NEMY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dr. Merle E. Frampton, an internationally known leader in the
education and rehabilitation of the visually handicapped, died on
Dec. 17 in Portland, Ore. He was 95.
</P>
<P>
   Frampton, the director of the New York Institute for the
Education of the Blind from 1935 to 1971, established many programs
that later became commonplace. He organized the first training
program for special education at Teachers College, Columbia
University, in 1936. Two years later, he opened Camp Wapanacki in
Hardwick, Vt., the first camp in the nation for visually impaired
children, and the following year he started a program for
deaf-blind and multihandicapped blind children.
</P>
<P>
   In World War II, he served as chief of rehabilitation services
for the Navy, starting a rehabilitation course to restore the
morale of sailors and marines blinded in battle and to retrain them
for civilian life. He also organized a victory garden, tended by
students, in a plot behind the New York Institute's building in the
Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1950s, Frampton, together with the institute's athletic
director, persuaded Cornell University to contribute two four-oared
racing shells so blind oarsmen could compete in the New York Rowing
Association's annual Memorial Day regatta. The institute's other
athletic activities included wrestling, track and volleyball,
played with a ball containing a bell.
</P>
<P>
   In his long career, Frampton helped develop state and federal
legislation for the education of the handicapped and helped draft a
New York state law for the education of the visually impaired and
hearing-impaired.
</P>
<P>
   He also personally financed several scholarships from the
teaching stipends he received at Columbia University and Hunter
College. At Hunter, he organized a department of special education
in 1945. After his retirement in 1971, he continued working for
better diagnostic programs for handicapped children.
</P>
<P>
   Frampton's work with the visually handicapped extended to
diverse locations like Arizona, Central and South America, Europe
and Asia. He was also a prolific writer on education and
rehabilitation, particularly as it applied to the visually
impaired. Among his publications were ``Education for the
Handicapped'' (1940), ``The School Assembly as an Education Force''
(1943) and ``Forgotten Children'' (1969).
</P>
<P>
   Frampton was born in Smithfield, W.Va., on Sept. 15, 1903. He
graduated from Boston University in 1927 and received a doctorate
from Harvard University in 1934.
</P>
<P>
   His wife, the former Iris Coldwell, died in 1972. He is survived
by two daughters, Iris Muggenthaler of Charlotte, Vt., and Diane
Bickford of Portland, and three grandchildren.

WITH 4 TOP-25 TEAMS, BIG EAST HAVING A RESURGENCE
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By RON DICKER 
  
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Big East Conference's mediocrity in men's basketball in
recent years is spawning a resurgence. No player left early for the
National Basketball Association last season, giving the conference
some much-needed continuity.
</P>
<P>
   The Big East leads the nation with a 9-8 record over ranked
opponents and boasted four teams in the top 25 through Sunday: No.
1 Connecticut, No. 12 St. John's, No. 18 Pittsburgh and No. 22
Syracuse.
</P>
<P>
   The flow of Big East underclassmen to the pros will likely
resume next season. Connecticut's star, the junior Richard
Hamilton, is nearly certain to enter the draft, and the Huskies'
sophomore guard, Khalid El-Amin, is a possibility.
</P>
<P>
   St. John's sophomore forward, Ron Artest, is maturing so rapidly
that talk of him departing early has also begun. In the Red Storm's
77-73 victory last Saturday, he carried St. John's with 25 points
and 8 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Mike Jarvis hopes Artest has such a great year that the
NBA becomes a viable option. ``Whatever decision he makes,'' Jarvis
said Sunday, ``as long as he does it for the right reasons, will be
good for him and St. John's.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ST. JOHN'S &LR;  (11-2, 3-0), is riding an eight-game winning
streak, and will face Niagara on Monday night. Jarvis has hammered
home the point that a loss to a team from a lower conference could
damage the team's tournament chances more than a loss to a Big East
team. The Red Storm has responded by blowing out every soft touch.
</P>
<P>
   St. John's could be facing the conference's toughest defense at
Miami (8-2, 2-0) on Wednesday. The Hurricanes have limited their
last five opponents to under 40 percent from the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you play against teams like that,'' Jarvis said, ``you
can only get better.''
</P>
<P>
   The centers Albert Richardson and Donald Emanuel continued their
spotty production, not scoring against Rutgers. Jarvis is
determined to give them minutes to spell the regulars and prepare
them for the future.
</P>
<P>
   `'We're 11-2,'' he said. `'I'm getting production out of the
team.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; CONNECTICUT  &LR; (11-0, 3-0) has coach Jim Calhoun fretting over
the No. 1 Huskies' lack of focus against overmatched teams. ``We
played scoreboard the rest of the way,'' Calhoun said after UConn
raced out to a 14-2 lead over Georgetown before coasting to an
87-64 victory last Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton's scoring average is down to 19.4 points a game,
putting more of a burden on the other forward, Kevin Freeman (13.7
points). El-Amin (14.6 points) and the defensive specialist Ricky
Moore continue to blur the distinction as to who the real playmaker
is. Moore, normally assigned to guard the opponent's best scorer,
has six more assists than El-Amin and has taken 62 fewer shots.
El-Amin scored 22 points and had just 1 assist against the Hoyas.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are going to be games this year when I'm going to get
people involved as the point guard,'' El-Amin said. `'And there are
other games where they're going to need me to be the scorer.''
</P>
<P>
   UConn travels to Boston College (3-7, 0-2) on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; SETON HALL  &LR; (9-4, 3-1) had its seven-game winning snapped by
Providence on last Saturday, but it is still floating above the
middle of the pack entering Monday night's game against Georgetown
(7-5, 0-3). Consistent scoring from the wings Gary Saunders (16.2
points, 54 percent shooting) and Rimas Kaukenas (14.5 points, 55
percent shooting) has been an important asset. Shaheen Holloway
remains a generous point guard at 6.8 assists a game, but his 10.4
scoring average and 35 percent field-goal percentage limit the
Pirates' options.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; RUTGERS  &LR; (9-4, 2-2) gets a week off to absorb a 77-73 loss to
St. John's after squandering a 14-point lead. ``We're learning
about ourselves,'' coach Kevin Bannon said. ``We know our
limitations. We had a chance against the No. 12 team in the
country. I'm very happy with my team.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; PROVIDENCE  &LR; (9-4, 2-2) is proving to be more than just ``Jamel
Thomas and others.'' The Friars followed triumphs over Purdue and
Pittsburgh with a 66-49 victory over Seton Hall last Saturday. The
49 points was the Hall's lowest total this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought our halfcourt defense over the last two games has
been the best it's been all season,'' coach Tim Welsh said. ``We
are finally understanding what we have to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Providence plays host to West Virginia (7-6, 2-2) on Tuesday.
The Mountaineers are 0-4 on the road.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; PITTSBURGH &LR; 's Vonteego Cummings is slumping. The other guard,
Kellii Taylor, has not played the last two games for personal
reasons. The result is a three-game conference losing streak and a
certain fall from the top 25. So much for the comeback of the
Panthers (8-5, 0-3).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; NOTRE DAME &LR;  Troy Murphy, a freshman from Sparta, N.J., is
averaging 19.4 points and 9 rebounds. Murphy scored in double
figures in his first 12 games. The Fighting Irish (7-6, 1-1) play
host to Pittsburgh on Tuesday.

`THE NUTCRACKER': FOR DESSERT, FEASTING ON A FRENCH BONBON

<P>
   NEW YORK _ After five weeks of ``The Nutcracker'' at the New
York City Ballet, any additional dancing foodstuffs might seem a
surfeit. But Isabelle Guerin's guest appearance as the Sugarplum
Fairy on Saturday night was welcome icing on the cake.
</P>
<P>
   An etoile, or principal, at the Paris Opera Ballet, Ms. Guerin
used her ballerina presence to the utmost. She stood out in relief
from the start and brought light into the New York State Theater in
the production that already dazzles on its own when danced as
brilliantly as its choreographer, George Balanchine, intended.
</P>
<P>
   Damian Woetzel, Ms. Guerin's cavalier in the grand pas de deux,
was at his disciplined best, striking in the nobility of his astute
partnering. He whipped off smooth quadruple turns in the brief
coda, and Ms. Guerin seemed as enchanted with him as he was with
her.
</P>
<P>
   She knew how to stress the musical climaxes of Tchaikovsky's
score: Every hop onto Woetzel's shoulder, every extreme back arch
or every held arabesque was etched on the viewer's vision,
emphasized not as feats in themselves but as exuberant dance
images.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Guerin has sometimes looked more at home in the ballets of
Jerome Robbins than in those by Balanchine. But here she was at
ease, leading one's eye to her wonderfully arched foot. She danced
with gracious authority.
</P>
<P>
   The matinee performance, led efficiently by Peter Boal and
Yvonne Borree, incorporated the wonderfully shaped dancing of
Pascale van Kipnis as Dewdrop. One also noticed Riolama Lorenzo's
unabashed allure as Coffee and the boyish energy of Adam
Hendrickson as leader of the Candy Canes.

SPORTS COLUMN: IT'S THE REAL BEGINNING OF THE END FOR THE NBA
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By WILLIAM C. RHODEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The media campaign began the last two weeks with
full-page newspaper advertisements. The blitz continues Monday
night on ``Larry King Live,'' when Billy Hunter, the executive
director of the players' association, and Patrick Ewing, the
union's president, bring its case before the nation.
</P>
<P>
   With only three days to go before the league's deadline for
canceling the season, Hunter and Ewing are expanding the battle
against National Basketball Association owners from the bargaining
table to the court of public opinion, where up to now the players
have been crucified. The NBA has done its typically masterful job
of presenting its side and putting the players in the worst
possible light.
</P>
<P>
   ``You go around, you realize that people are either misinformed,
uninformed or they refuse to be informed,'' Hunter said Saturday.
``The perception is that, one, we're on strike, two, that the
players are being unfair, or unreasonable.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Hunter _ whose players are locked out, not on strike _ was asked
if he thought about how history might portray him if the
unthinkable occurs and the entire season is lost. For NBA
Commissioner David Stern, it would be part of a long legacy, but
this is the first major chapter in Hunter's professional sports
biography.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's something I haven't even considered,'' Hunter said.
``That's the farthest thing from my mind. All I'm concerned about
is the here and now.''
</P>
<P>
   That may well be, but Hunter has introduced a distinct and
consistent civil-rights motif to the seven-month-old lockout; a
We-Shall-Not-Be-Moved obstinacy by the players. The civil-rights
analogy is dismissed by critics as posturing at worst; as, at best,
an attempt by Hunter to use race as a superficial bond to keep the
players unified. But movements are not sustained by posturing.
Instead, they take strength from the resistance of the structure
they push up against.
</P>
<P>
   In this case the NBA owners, figuring they only had to lean on
players to win concessions, anticipated an easy game. ``I can see
why,'' Hunter said. ``The perception of professional athletes,
especially basketball players, because they've never been
challenged before, is that they weren't up to the task. That if you
put a gun to their heads they would collapse. But that hasn't
happened. And that's a quandary now.''
</P>
<P>
   The unexpected resolve shown by the players may, at least for
some, have its roots in the fact that they have gotten beyond the
immediacy of money, to an appreciation of what came before them and
a concern for players coming after them. They've grasped broader
issues of principle. During the protests of the 1950s, the issue
was not sitting beside white customers at lunch counters _it was
sitting where one pleased. The issue for the players is not just
splitting $2 billion in revenue, but sharing the profits of an
empire that each side created _ one with money, the other with
muscle.
</P>
<P>
   Hunter, 55, helped players understand that, in large part by
explaining that the foundation of his own resolve goes beyond a
labor dispute or an ego battle with Stern. His foundation is a
deeply rooted family tradition of battling for liberty.
</P>
<P>
   Hunter's great great grandfather was William Still, one of the
most respected black operatives on the Underground Railroad in the
East. In the years leading to the Civil War, Still led
Philadelphia's Vigilance Committee, which provided assistance to
fugitive slaves. He was born free, but both his parents had been
slaves. Still's mother escaped before he was born; his father
bought his way out of slavery and died free.
</P>
<P>
   Hunter first learned about his heritage while he was an
undergraduate at Syracuse, where he played football. Hunter led a
drive to boycott games against Southern schools with segregated
stadiums.
</P>
<P>
   While owners certainly don't have to worry about their players
suddenly becoming radical, the lockout may have roused one or two
sleeping giants.
</P>
<P>
   ``Historically, professional athletes _ especially
African-American athletes, those who have made it _ have always
been apolitical,'' Hunter said. ``Everybody's always told them that
you've got to just play ball, keep your nose down, stay out of
trouble and you're going to be all right. All of a sudden owners
see that some of the ballplayers are talking about standing on
principle, they're talking about history and experiences their
people had in terms of struggles.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the majority of players, the lockout has been a wake-up
call. Having missed two months and some play, they understand that
this game is tangential. This is a taste of what it will be like
when your career ends.''
</P>
<P>
   Is this the beginning of the end? No one is sure, not even
Hunter. ``Ballplayers will continue to receive substantial
salaries, but they just won't be phenomenal,'' Hunter said.
``They'll just be more controlled. Maybe that's what it means.''
</P>
<P>
   Rest assured: this struggle won't be over when the lockout ends.
Things may get better, but they'll never be the same.

COMMENTARY: THREE REASONS FOR A NEW CHINA POLICY 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By WILLIAM SAFIRE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A couple of Shanghai prostitutes let themselves
into a hotel room occupied by a Chinese man who had discussed human
rights in a local teahouse. With a quick couple of zips, the girls
stood naked. Moments later, police entered the room and arrested
the dissident for patronizing prostitutes.
</P>
<P>
   This old entrapment-and-blackmail dodge run by the frightened
men ruling China is their crude way of trying to discredit the tiny
group that wants to start a labor union and perhaps a non-Communist
political party.
</P>
<P>
   Why this transparent subterfuge? Because the nationwide
crackdown on dissidence, begun as President Clinton visited China
and hailed Jiang Zemin as his partner, is not playing well in the
world press and may not be going down well inside China.
</P>
<P>
   But why should Beijing go to the trouble of disguising the
jailing of a relative handful of troublemakers? Intellectuals and
students do not a counterrevolution make.
</P>
<P>
   The logical reason for the iron fist is instability in the
Forbidden City at the prospect of economic hard times. A generation
anesthetized by ever-rising prosperity is growing restive at slower
growth. In the vast countryside, we have reports that farmers are
grumbling, unable to market bumper crops; in the jammed cities, an
army of the underemployed posits a threat of unrest.
</P>
<P>
   The Communist leadership knows that the Soviet breakup began
with Solidarity, supported by Lane Kirkland's AFL-CIO, and the
stress on the state-stagnated system of Reagan's arms race; the
ensuing dissatisfaction of workers and farmers was ignited by a
cadre of underestimated dissidents. Fear of that scenario explains
the desperate need of Jiang to squelch every peep of opposition.
</P>
<P>
   Here in America, we are beginning to discover how brazenly the
sclerotic Chinese regime has stolen our missile technology, and how
it played on the naivete and financial need of our politicians to
influence our trade policies.
</P>
<P>
   Last week the bipartisan Cox Committee revealed the tip of the
iceberg of espionage penetration. Stimulated by a Jeff Gerth
article in The New York Times, it began investigating China's
illegal acquisition of all sorts of national-security secrets.
Because the committee tracked some of the Chinese spy successes
back to Republican administrations, it was able to issue a
unanimous report even in these times.
</P>
<P>
   If the White House allows enough of the 700-page report to be
declassified, it will show that the worst hemorrhage of secrets
took place in recent years. That's partly because our
counterintelligence was flummoxed by Larry Wu-tai Chin's
successors, but mainly because Clinton flip-flopped on trade with
China. Restrictions came off; we now pump $60 billion a year into
the regime. Worse, he steered the regulation of technology transfer
to the complaisant Commerce Department.
</P>
<P>
   Which brings us to Col. Liu, a Chinese intelligence agent,
daughter of a top general, who channeled money through
Asian-American fronts to the Clinton-Gore and other campaigns.
Where stands the prosecution of the notorious ``China connection''?
</P>
<P>
   Becalmed. After nearly two years of resisting independent
counsel lest it embarrass the White House, the deeply conflicted
Reno Justice Department made a show of activity by charging a few
small-fry with being China's conduits to the Democrats. Then the
foot-draggers of Justice ran into the new ``Turn 'em Loose Bruce''
on the federal bench.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Clinton must be happy to have this case in the hands of his
Democratic appointee, Paul Friedman. This judge has further
crippled the lame Justice investigation by throwing out most of the
counts against Maria Hsia, Charlie Trie and Pauline Kanchanalak.
Under his curious reading of election law, Saddam Hussein and the
KGB would be free to contribute millions to the Democratic National
Committee so long as it is ``soft money.''
</P>
<P>
   Here's the box score: one serious investigation of Chinese
penetration suppressed because it's secret, the other stymied
because of incompetence and misjudgment.
</P>
<P>
   In the light of (1) China's desperate duplicity on human rights;
(2) the 38 secret recommendations by the House to stem the flow of
secrets to China and then to Iran and North Korea, and (3) the
botched and scotched investigation into the change of trade policy
amid heavy contributions _ isn't it time to rethink our
``partnership''?
</P>
<P>
   Forget ``Who lost China?'' Consider ``Who Shanghaied America?''

`SALUTE TO VIENNA': INVOKING A NEW YEAR'S TRADITION 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By JAMES R. OESTREICH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Not that the New Year's concerts of the Vienna
Philharmonic are in any way sacrosanct. Far from it.
</P>
<P>
   It was hard to tell from the hopelessly scattered and
horrendously overproduced PBS broadcast ``From Vienna: The New
Year's Celebration 1999'' on Friday exactly what happened in the
hall this year, with Lorin Maazel conducting (and playing violin,
drum and cymbal). But one thing was clear: The shtick was far more
heavy-handed and cloying than any this listener saw there a decade
or so ago.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the ``Salute to Vienna'' presented on Friday afternoon at
Avery Fisher Hall by Attila Glatz Concert Productions as a
``re-creation of the world-famous New Year's concert of the Vienna
Philharmonic,'' with music by Robert Stolz, Lehar and Kalman as
well as the Strauss family, was doomed by its own pretensions.
</P>
<P>
   For one obvious difference, the Orchestra of St. Luke's, as fine
an all-purpose band as it is, is no Vienna Philharmonic, especially
in quintessentially Viennese repertory; here, it was underrehearsed
and without some of its best players.
</P>
<P>
   For another, Avery Fisher Hall, even with a stageful of flowers,
is no Musikvereinsaal in Vienna; however well the latest acoustical
encumbrances may have served their purpose, no one has ever called
them pretty, let alone festive.
</P>
<P>
   The invocation of the Vienna event may have helped fill the
house, but it also raised inevitable and unfair comparisons. It may
also have tempted the performers, notably Peter Guth, an Austrian
conductor (who, like Maazel and Johann Strauss himself, played
violin at times), into excess.
</P>
<P>
   The program, with several numbers sung by Izabela Labuda, a
Polish soprano, was long, and made longer by unsolicited reprises
of two vocal items. And Guth carried shtick to lofty heights,
presenting one group of string players in garish ``Gypsy'' garb for
an aria from Kalman's ``Countess Maritza'' and trooping another
group down an aisle in the ``Radetzky March'' of the elder Johann
Strauss. It was hard to tell which was more uncomfortable.
</P>
<P>
   Former dancers of the New York City Ballet were also on hand,
adding but little to the gaiety of the event and much to the
overall impression of unwieldiness.
</P>
<P>
   No matter; the large crowd seemed pleased for the most part,
though to judge from tepid applause on one occasion, it did see
through Ms. Labuda's unidiomatic performance of Gershwin (``By
Strauss'') if not the orchestra's unidiomatic performances of
Strauss. And to be sure, for a listener as susceptible to this
captivating music as any, there were elements enjoyable on their
own terms, shorn of invidious comparisons.
</P>
<P>
   More to the point, would that the broadcast from Vienna had
offered a better representation of the great New Year's tradition
of the Vienna Philharmonic. All in all, a rocky start to the new
musical year.

EDITORIAL: WHITHER THE TUBE? 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Monday, Jan. 4:
</P>
<P>
   No one in the television industry has enjoyed the past year. The
networks _ six of them now _ preside over a steadily falling
audience share, and NBC has even considered suing Nielsen Media
Research for what the network says is under-reporting of the
critical 18-to-34-year-old viewing audience. Nielsen's measurements
allegedly cost the network $60 million in advertising revenues.
Meanwhile, network programmers have left their jobs in droves, and
the networks have begun to replace them with programmers from
cable. The production costs of prime-time shows have gone through
the roof.
</P>
<P>
   Digital television, perennially in the offing but now getting
really close, will soon increase the number of channels to around
1,500, fracturing the audience into ever smaller shards and
enticing phone companies and Internet providers onto the tube.
Channels like MTV and the A&AMP;E Network have begun to spawn and morph
as fast as fruit flies. Meanwhile a clear racial divide between
black and white audiences has emerged, leading one producer to
speak of ``a chitlin circuit on TV.'' One of the few bright spots _
speaking only of revenue _ has been the WB network, which has a
popular lineup of shows for occult teen-agers and a big hit called
``Dawson's Creek,'' a kind of Titanic in a skiff watched every week
by teen-age girls on the phone with other teen-age girls.
</P>
<P>
   The obvious question _ besides ``What's on?'' _ is ``What does
it all mean?'' One answer is that for years an extremely narrow
bandwidth _ three channels representing three networks _ severely
compressed the TV-visible demographics of this country. As the
bandwidth has expanded _ as the number of channels has increased _
TV has begun more accurately to reflect the diversity of audience
markets in this country.
</P>
<P>
   The problem, of course, is that it costs a lot of money to
produce television shows: it is an inherently expensive medium. A
cable channel or a network may begin by seeking a niche market. But
the economics of television work only if that niche market rapidly
broadens. That is what provides value to advertisers, if not to
viewers. Established networks and cable channels have an enormous
advantage, even as they clone themselves, because they already
control a stockpile of paid-up shows. That is why when digital
channels begin to multiply we will be watching a lot of leftovers.
Luckily, Americans are used to that.
</P>
<P>
   But does anyone besides the executives at ABC, NBC and CBS
really miss the days of network domination? Only, perhaps, to the
extent that we miss the forced passivity of having so few choices.
There is, in fact, a certain danger in the recent fractionating of
TV. Some of the ways the audience has been sliced _ Fox's Boyz and
Girlz channels, the marginalizing of black programs _ are
potentially harmful. But to the lament that we are losing a sense
of national community as television grapples with its recombinant
future, there is only one thing to say: Get a life.  &QL;

<P>
   DENVER _ They used to joke in Denver that you could stand at the
top of 17th Street, one of the main thoroughfares in the city
center, and send a bowling ball down its entire length without it
meeting a single obstacle along the way. That, though, was 10 years
ago. Today, your ball wouldn't travel half a block.
</P>
<P>
   Something surprising has happened here, and the rest of the
United States is starting to notice.
</P>
<P>
   Where once its inner-city neighborhoods were the preserves of
down-and-outs and office workers who fled hotfoot at sundown to the
suburbs, they stand now as a symbol of urban renaissance.
</P>
<P>
   Above all, significant numbers of Denverites are abandoning the
suburbs and settling again in the heart of the city.
</P>
<P>
   They have been answering the developers' advertisements with
headlines such as ``Kiss the 'burbs g'bye.'' Such is the appeal
suddenly of one section of Denver's downtown, an area of once
abandoned brick warehouses now converted into fashionable lofts,
nicknamed LoDo, property prices are now higher there than in any
neighborhood of Denver bar one.
</P>
<P>
   To answer demand, the city has embarked on a $1 billion housing
construction spree with 1,334 new apartments being built or
converted in the center.
</P>
<P>
   It is a movement that seems especially counter-intuitive in
Denver. The galloping sprawl of its freeways, malls and suburban
homes across the high plains and into the foothills of the Rocky
Mountains has been typical of the American experience since the
Second World War.
</P>
<P>
   And new evidence has emerged to suggest that Denver may not be
alone in the U.S. in seeing a revival of its once-rotting inner
core.
</P>
<P>
   A survey by the Brookings Institution and the Fannie Mae
Foundation, a federal housing agency, shows that 24 cities across
the country expect to see increases in the numbers living in their
downtown areas.
</P>
<P>
   While the numbers are small relative to the human flood still
fueling the growth of the suburbs, they nonetheless represent a
significant reversal in the decades-old trend of urban flight.
</P>
<P>
   Cities highlighted in the report include Houston, which is
forecasting a quadrupling of its inner-city residents by the year
2010 to reach 9,500. Chicago, Seattle, Boston, Portland,
Minneapolis and Cleveland are also preparing to accommodate growing
downtown populations.
</P>
<P>
   Denver, according to the report, now ``has a distinct, vibrant,
fashionable image,'' that should translate into a near tripling of
its downtown population from 3,480 to 9,250 by the end of the next
decade.
</P>
<P>
   Dan du Bois can claim to be one of the LoDo pioneers. He moved
here with his wife from an outer Denver suburb a decade ago and has
never looked back.
</P>
<P>
   ``We moved down here on a lark really. Back in the suburbs there
was nothing to do at night and we didn't know any of our neighbors.
We moved into the city to see what it was like.''
</P>
<P>
   When they first arrived, they looked out onto a crumbling
concrete overpass with homeless families living beneath it. Now
both the flyover and the families have gone.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent evening, standing on the flat roof of the loft
apartment which she bought in 1993, Barbara Gibson surveyed the
LoDo landscape that she has grown to love.
</P>
<P>
   Across the street stands the Karmen Western Wear factory, a
group of four warehouse buildings that would fetch a sky-high price
from developers if one day the family firm decides to sell. To the
north, she points out the lighting towers of Coors Field, the home
of the Denver baseball team.
</P>
<P>
   The 1995 opening of Coors Field, built in historic brick and
cast-iron style, further contributed to the resurrection of the
LoDo area.
</P>
<P>
   When she first moved to Denver six years ago from northern
California, Barbara, a financial executive for Compaq computers,
spent six months in the suburbs and ``hated it.'' She heard about
the new lofts being converted in LoDo through a newspaper article.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really wanted to find a neighborhood. I'm not married and I
don't have kids and the type of neighborhood I wanted, you just
can't find in the suburbs. There isn't a day when I don't go out my
door here and see people I know.''
</P>
<P>
   It is precisely people without children and with sufficient
income who are finding new appeal in inner-city living. ``The
demographics are really working in our favor,'' says Bill Mosher,
who heads the Downtown Denver Partnership.
</P>
<P>
   Particularly important, he adds, are the so-called
``empty-nesters,'' members of America's baby-boom generation who
have now seen their own children leave home and who have new money
to spend.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of a sudden they don't want to drive all the time,''
Mosher argues, ``they don't want to mow their lawns and they want
to be in the fun of downtown.''
</P>
<P>
   With restaurants, a performing arts complex, two sports grounds
and a soon-to-open aquarium, downtown Denver has indeed acquired a
new bustle. And, like many other cities, it has benefited from
tumbling crime rates.
</P>
<P>
   Relating the bowling-ball joke, Mosher underlines the extent of
the change in 10 years. ``People forget that Denver back in 1988
was sick, sick, sick.'' LoDo, where half the warehouses were empty,
was known then as Denver's skid row, ``because that is exactly what
it was.''
</P>
<P>
   A pivotal force in LoDo has been Jerry Glick, a real estate
developer who used to make his living building homes and malls in
the suburbs. In the mid-eighties, he turned his attention to LoDo
and headed the effort that led to its designation in 1989 as a
historic district.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've invested 15 years of my life in downtown because I
believe in the revitalization of the core. If the core dies, the
city dies,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In an office of exposed brick and heavy wooden beams inside what
was once a seed warehouse, Glick warns that emulating Denver's
success in other cities may not come easily.
</P>
<P>
   Above all, he said, cities need extraordinary political will,
from the office of the mayor down, to lift up an inner-city area
once it has gone downhill.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this is really a local phenomenon, not a national
one,'' he commented. ``But could it be done in other places?
Yes.'' &QL;

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL SULLIVAN  
 c. 1998, Houston Chronicle  
TEMPE, Ariz. _ Bobby Bowden has heard all the rhetoric emanating
from New Orleans and Columbus, Ohio. Having been in similar
situations before, he can even be a little sympathetic with a
colleague's plight.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Even so, the 69-year-old Florida State coach isn't interested in
engaging in any debate beyond the one to be settled at Sun Devil
Stadium beginning a little after 7 tonight. If Ohio State and coach
John Cooper feel left out of the party well, the fact is, the
Buckeyes weren't invited.
</P>
<P>
   Get over it, OK?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't blame John one bit for feeling the way he does,''
Bowden said Sunday on the eve of his 11-1 team's Fiesta Bowl
showdown with 12-0 and No. 1-ranked Tennessee. ``John might have
the best football team in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``But if Tennessee wins this ballgame, they're going to be
national champions. And if we win this ballgame, we're going to be
national champions.''
</P>
<P>
   That's the idea, at least, and a breathless rush of postseason
activity has done little to upset the Bowl Championship Series
scheme hatched by Southeastern Conference commissioner Roy Kramer
in the interest of creating a consensus No. 1-vs.-No. 2 matchup for
all the chips.
</P>
<P>
   If Tennessee wins, there will be no room for discussion. The
Vols will be 13-0, and coach Phillip Fulmer will have exorcised all
demons, including any rattling around from last year's 42-17 Orange
Bowl pounding by national co-champion Nebraska.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the next step, a big hump for us,'' Fulmer said. ``We
like being at the next level.''
</P>
<P>
   If Florida State, a 5{-point favorite despite an early-season
loss to North Carolina State, should prevail to finish 12-1, the
Seminoles will point to a schedule that included eight bowl teams.
(FSU also could point out that its loss came on the road to a bowl
qualifier, while Ohio State was defeated at home by 6-6 Michigan
State.)
</P>
<P>
   So adios, Buckeyes. After a season of debate and criticism, the
BCS gives you Tennessee and Florida State as its defining act _ a
would-be team of destiny against one given new life by a rash of
upsets that made this trip possible.
</P>
<P>
   For a bit of extra spice, throw in one coach trying to win his
first national title and another seeking to enhance an
already-healthy legend.
</P>
<P>
   Come to think of it, a few of the other subplots aren't so bad,
either:
</P>
<P>
   Who might crack at quarterback?
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee's Tee Martin has stepped out of the shadows of
Volunteers legend Peyton Manning to lead the school to its
first-ever 12-win season, emerging as a more-than-competent passer
in the season's second half.
</P>
<P>
   His counterpart, FSU's Marcus Outzen, was third-team coming into
the season before injuries knocked out Dan Kendra and Chris Weinke.
But Outzen earned a spot in Seminoles lore with a sometimes-lucky,
sometimes-good afternoon in a win over Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Peerless or Peter?
</P>
<P>
   Peerless Price has been Tennessee's big-play man at receiver,
turning around the Southeastern Conference Championship Game with a
fourth-quarter touchdown against Mississippi State. The Seminoles'
Peter Warrick, in turn, caught a big touchdown pass and threw for
another in the season-ending win over the archrival Gators.
</P>
<P>
   How many Travises does it take to win a national title?
</P>
<P>
   (This is not an Aggie joke.)
</P>
<P>
   After losing gifted tailback Jamal Lewis to a season-ending knee
injury, Tennessee turned to Travis Henry (970 yards) and Travis
Stephens (477) to fill the void. Florida State's top ball-carrier
is Travis Minor, who finished with 857 yards despite missing two
games because of injury.
</P>
<P>
   ``The burden, to me, is on Minor and Henry and the tailbacks of
Tennessee,'' Bowden said. ``Those are the guys who can win the
ballgame and probably will.''
</P>
<P>
   Who's going to score first or at all?
</P>
<P>
   Florida State ranks No. 1 in the nation in total defense, giving
up just 214.8 yards per game, and is second in scoring defense
(11.5 points per game). Tennessee is No. 6 against the run (93.9
yards), No. 9 in scoring defense (14.4 points) and 17th in total
defense (303.0 yards).
</P>
<P>
   ``Their defense is for real,'' Bowden said. ``Ours is ranked
higher _ I don't know how _ but they look about like us.''
</P>
<P>
   One kick for all the marbles, anyone?
</P>
<P>
   FSU's Sebastian Janikowski made 27 of 32 field-goal attempts
this season. Tennessee's Jeff Hall converted 19 of 24 field goals,
including a last-second game-winner at Syracuse and an overtime
game-winner against Florida.
</P>
<P>
   So you like a little suspense?
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee needed that last-gasp field goal to beat Syracuse, the
OT kick against Florida and an Arkansas collapse in the final
minutes to keep this championship dream alive. Even in the SEC
title game, the Vols seemed destined to join Kansas State and UCLA
in a ``Big Three'' trifecta of nose dives before pulling things out
against Jackie Sherrill's Bulldogs.
</P>
<P>
   Florida State needed Outzen, making only his second career
start, to come up big against Florida.
</P>
<P>
   The new kid or the legend?
</P>
<P>
   After enduring no shortage of whispers that he couldn't win the
big one, Fulmer finally got past Steve Spurrier and Florida this
year. Now, all Volunteers fans want is the national championship
they have been waiting for since the school claimed its first and
only one in 1951 _ 21 years before Fulmer graduated.
</P>
<P>
   Bowden, of course, has done this before, but not often. This is
the 11th straight season in which his Seminoles ranked among the
top five in the Associated Press poll by the end of the season, but
he has just one national title (1993) to show for all that
excellence.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first national championship, it was not a feeling of
elation; it was the fact that it got the monkey off my back,''
Bowden said. ``When we finally won one, it was a feeling of, `Thank
goodness.'
</P>
<P>
   ``If we won another one, I think it would be a little more
exciting. I think I'd enjoy it more than the last one.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the folks who exited New Orleans whining?
</P>
<P>
   Put up the snow shovels, break out the chips and hot sauce, sit
back and enjoy the show.

</P>
<P>
   To answer demand, the city has embarked on a $1 billion housing
construction spree with 1,334 new apartments being built or
converted in the center.
</P>
<P>
   It is a movement that seems especially counter-intuitive in
Denver. The galloping sprawl of its freeways, malls and suburban
homes across the high plains and into the foothills of the Rocky
Mountains has been typical of the American experience since the
Second World War.
</P>
<P>
   And new evidence has emerged to suggest that Denver may not be
alone in the U.S. in seeing a revival of its once-rotting inner
core.
</P>
<P>
   A survey by the Brookings Institution and the Fannie Mae
Foundation, a federal housing agency, shows that 24 cities across
the country expect to see increases in the numbers living in their
downtown areas.
</P>
<P>
   While the numbers are small relative to the human flood still
fueling the growth of the suburbs, they nonetheless represent a
significant reversal in the decades-old trend of urban flight.
</P>
<P>
   Cities highlighted in the report include Houston, which is
forecasting a quadrupling of its inner-city residents by the year
2010 to reach 9,500. Chicago, Seattle, Boston, Portland,
Minneapolis and Cleveland are also preparing to accommodate growing
downtown populations.
</P>
<P>
   Denver, according to the report, now ``has a distinct, vibrant,
fashionable image,'' that should translate into a near tripling of
its downtown population from 3,480 to 9,250 by the end of the next
decade.
</P>
<P>
   Dan du Bois can claim to be one of the LoDo pioneers. He moved
here with his wife from an outer Denver suburb a decade ago and has
never looked back.
</P>
<P>
   ``We moved down here on a lark really. Back in the suburbs there
was nothing to do at night and we didn't know any of our neighbors.
We moved into the city to see what it was like.''
</P>
<P>
   When they first arrived, they looked out onto a crumbling
concrete overpass with homeless families living beneath it. Now
both the flyover and the families have gone.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent evening, standing on the flat roof of the loft
apartment which she bought in 1993, Barbara Gibson surveyed the
LoDo landscape that she has grown to love.
</P>
<P>
   Across the street stands the Karmen Western Wear factory, a
group of four warehouse buildings that would fetch a sky-high price
from developers if one day the family firm decides to sell. To the
north, she points out the lighting towers of Coors Field, the home
of the Denver baseball team.
</P>
<P>
   The 1995 opening of Coors Field, built in historic brick and
cast-iron style, further contributed to the resurrection of the
LoDo area.
</P>
<P>
   When she first moved to Denver six years ago from northern
California, Barbara, a financial executive for Compaq computers,
spent six months in the suburbs and ``hated it.'' She heard about
the new lofts being converted in LoDo through a newspaper article.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really wanted to find a neighborhood. I'm not married and I
don't have kids and the type of neighborhood I wanted, you just
can't find in the suburbs. There isn't a day when I don't go out my
door here and see people I know.''
</P>
<P>
   It is precisely people without children and with sufficient
income who are finding new appeal in inner-city living. ``The
demographics are really working in our favor,'' says Bill Mosher,
who heads the Downtown Denver Partnership.
</P>
<P>
   Particularly important, he adds, are the so-called
``empty-nesters,'' members of America's baby-boom generation who
have now seen their own children leave home and who have new money
to spend.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of a sudden they don't want to drive all the time,''
Mosher argues, ``they don't want to mow their lawns and they want
to be in the fun of downtown.''
</P>
<P>
   With restaurants, a performing arts complex, two sports grounds
and a soon-to-open aquarium, downtown Denver has indeed acquired a
new bustle. And, like many other cities, it has benefited from
tumbling crime rates.
</P>
<P>
   Relating the bowling-ball joke, Mosher underlines the extent of
the change in 10 years. ``People forget that Denver back in 1988
was sick, sick, sick.'' LoDo, where half the warehouses were empty,
was known then as Denver's skid row, ``because that is exactly what
it was.''
</P>
<P>
   A pivotal force in LoDo has been Jerry Glick, a real estate
developer who used to make his living building homes and malls in
the suburbs. In the mid-eighties, he turned his attention to LoDo
and headed the effort that led to its designation in 1989 as a
historic district.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've invested 15 years of my life in downtown because I
believe in the revitalization of the core. If the core dies, the
city dies,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In an office of exposed brick and heavy wooden beams inside what
was once a seed warehouse, Glick warns that emulating Denver's
success in other cities may not come easily.
</P>
<P>
   Above all, he said, cities need extraordinary political will,
from the office of the mayor down, to lift up an inner-city area
once it has gone downhill.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this is really a local phenomenon, not a national
one,'' he commented. ``But could it be done in other places?
Yes.'' &QL;

   SAN FRANCISCO _ Mary Leonard is not the sort of English
professor to lash out at her students. So she took herself by
surprise when, during a recent online classroom discussion
conducted entirely by e-mail, she snapped at a particularly
obstreperous student for failing to register when his class
assignment was due.
</P>
<P>
   ``I posted a message about that last week, and if you can't
recall it that's your tough luck,'' she wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Stung by the rebuke, the student responded testily that he saw
nothing wrong in asking a direct question of his teacher and
expected a direct answer. That remark only provoked further
reactions from the cyberspatial classroom.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, Eric, you've got some balls. That's our professor you're
talking to,'' came one message. ``What happened to you? Did
somebody pee in your breakfast cereal this morning?'' came another.
``Touchy, touchy,'' came yet another.
</P>
<P>
   Soon the whole discussion threatened to veer out of control and
only a hasty call to order by Prof. Leonard shook the class back to
its senses.
</P>
<P>
   What had occurred was an instance of an e-mail phenomenon known
as ``flaming'' _ an outbreak of insults and tantrums of a kind that
seems particularly common online.
</P>
<P>
   According to Prof. Leonard, who teaches at the University of
Wisconsin, the use of the Internet changed the character of the
whole discussion.
</P>
<P>
   With the benefits of speed and a certain technological
headiness, the computer encouraged intemperate language and stroppy
behavior of a kind that the conventions of face-to-face contact
would almost certainly have held in check.
</P>
<P>
   And ``flaming'' is only one peculiarity that the Internet
appears to have brought to the English language. According to
various researchers, the Internet may also be eroding the formal
structure of the language, introducing errors of grammar and
spelling and making them acceptable, and winnowing away at the
overall complexity of English _ in other words, dumbing it down.
</P>
<P>
   Such concerns were at the forefront of a recent annual
conference of the U.S. Modern Languages Association, a body that
brings together university teachers of language or literature.
</P>
<P>
   Universities have been quick to embrace the Internet as a tool
of learning and research, believing it can spread knowledge far
beyond the traditional academy, but many of the conference papers
delivered in San Francisco sounded a more preoccupied note.
</P>
<P>
   As one conference forum asked in its title, could the Internet
be ``killing English with technology?''
</P>
<P>
   ``When the Internet first took off, some academics predicted
that it would lead to reduced linguistic complexity, reduced
politeness and reduced variability _ in other words, a greater
homogeneity in the written language,'' explained Susan Herring of
the University of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not that that was necessarily seen as a bad thing. Some people
viewed it as a liberation. The language might not be as elegant and
polished, but it would be more vital.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Prof. Herring's research, not all the predictions
have come true. Looking at the transcripts of an Internet
discussion forum between computer scientists over an 11-year period
_ from 1985 to 1996_ she found that the complexity of the language
actually stayed constant and the number of errors, if anything,
fell.
</P>
<P>
   There were, however, signs of growing informality, and a
distinct falloff in politeness.
</P>
<P>
   Prof. Herring concedes that her research was almost certainly
conditioned by the educational levels and professional correctness
of her subjects, and that other social groups were likely to give
different results.
</P>
<P>
   A number of studies have shown that ``flaming'' is more common
among men than women, for example.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, several professors at the conference reported that
the Internet acted a bit like a sounding board for the unconscious
_ loosening people's inhibitions as they lose sense of who their
audience is and let their fingers express thoughts before their
brains have time to repress them.
</P>
<P>
   That might explain, for example, why people rarely boast of
their exploits in the sex parlors of Bangkok at parties, but
willingly consign their intimate diaries to an easily accessible
Internet site (as revealed by Ryan Bishop and Lillian Robinson in a
paper entitled ``How My Dick Spent Its Summer Vacation.'').
</P>
<P>
   This ``unbuttoning'' effect can also have positive
repercussions, particularly in classrooms where the computer gives
more reticent students the time and space to express their thoughts
more fully.
</P>
<P>
   Dale Jacobs of East Carolina University said he was struck by
how many women, traditionally less forthcoming in discussions,
would give long, coherent accounts of their thoughts and feelings
online. On the other hand, men who were vocal in class tended to be
less original or insightful in their e-mail. &QL;

10 TUB-THUMPING FACTS ABOUT THE EURO

 By ISABEL BERWICK  
 c.1999 The Independent, London  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ We're all sick of the euro _ and trading in the new
currency hasn't even begun yet. But it is going to dominate the
political and economic agenda in 1999, so you may as well find out
what all the fuss is about.
</P>
<P>
   Make it your New Year's Resolution to learn 10 interesting
things about the euro.
</P>
<P>
   1. Yes, this crazy idea was dreamed up in the Sixties.
</P>
<P>
   Back then, the UK was not a member of what we called the Common
Market. We looked on as the usual sandal-wearing suspects (France,
Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium and Luxembourg _ plus Italy)
decided to make economic love, not war.
</P>
<P>
   In 1969 the European Summit approved a proposal to create an
Economic and Monetary Union (EMU). The plans were expected to take
10 years. Thirty years later...
</P>
<P>
   2. Half the U.K. population has no idea what is going on.
</P>
<P>
   Last month the BBC2 Money Program polled 1,000 representative
people and found 51 percent were unable to name the new single
currency. Good guesses included ``Curo'' and ``Eu.'' Fashionable
guesses included ``Ecru.'' Only hopeless people guessed
``Equarder.'' Asked how much one euro was worth in Real Money,
estimates varied from 1p to (pounds sterling)8. In fact it's about
70p.
</P>
<P>
   3. The euro will make life cheaper.
</P>
<P>
   Because the U.K. is no longer isolated, we'll be aware how much
more we pay for food and clothes. With any luck, retailers will
have to respond by dropping prices. The Internet boom will also
mean you'll be able to order cheaper euro-goods from abroad using a
credit card.
</P>
<P>
   4. You can carry a million pounds' worth of euros in one
briefcase.
</P>
<P>
   There will be a 500 euro note, worth (pounds sterling)350. Which
would mean (pounds sterling)1 million in euros could conveniently
fit in a briefcase. A million pounds in (pounds sterling)50 notes
would take up four cases, which attracts attention.
</P>
<P>
   The euro is the ideal way to carry your ill-gotten gains around
a Europe without internal borders. This is just one of many reasons
why the euro may displace the dollar as the international
criminal's currency of choice. To combat this, Europol _ the new
police force of Euroland _ started work last October.
</P>
<P>
   5. Those old-fashioned currencies are already dead.
</P>
<P>
   Shoppers and workers from Paris to Pisa will handle their francs
and lire until 2002, but the business side of these currencies is
in effect dead. The value of each currency against the euro was
fixed last Thursday and that's where it will stay forever.
</P>
<P>
   From Monday, businesses across Europe will accept cash in the
local currency but will run all their payment and accounting
systems in euros. Government and corporate bond issues will be in
euros, although each issuer will still be able to set the interest
rates it pays on its bonds.
</P>
<P>
   6. You can impress your neighbors with a euro-mortgage.
</P>
<P>
   Barclays and Abbey National have the first euro-mortgage deals,
with an interest rate reflecting the European Central Bank rate of
3 percent across Euroland (except Italy). This gives a
euro-mortgage rate of about 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   That sounds good when you are paying U.K. variable rates of 7.6
percent, but if sterling collapsed against the euro, your payments
would be worth dramatically less. You would have to pay more each
month to compensate for the lower value of each pound paid.
</P>
<P>
   7. Six people have supreme power over 300 million others.
</P>
<P>
   Six executives control the European Central Bank (ECB), oversee
the single currency and set interest rates. They can't be sacked
for eight years, and officially they only have to report to the
European Parliament once a year. Scary.
</P>
<P>
   8. Delaying euro notes and coins until 2002 is a ploy to deter
criminals.
</P>
<P>
   When euros appear in 2002, Europeans will be used to the idea
and won't (allegedly) get confused. So it will be harder to palm
off faked notes, or short-change customers.
</P>
<P>
   Each country will have up to six months to phase out its old
currency in favor of universal euro notes plus coins bearing a
national symbol. All euro notes have gates and windows on the front
_ ``symbols of openness and cooperation in the EU.'' On the back
you'll see a bridge from a particular age _ ``a metaphor for
communication among the people of Europe.'' These are generic
bridges, so no one is offended. One of the original designs showed
a bridge that looked too French; it was scrapped.
</P>
<P>
   9. Euroland is the size of the U.S.
</P>
<P>
   Even without Britain, the single currency zone compares well to
the States. Its economic output was almost equal to the U.S. before
the launch of the euro, and most of Europe (though not Britain) is
now growing faster than the U.S.
</P>
<P>
   If the euro does challenge the dollar as a world currency, it
will take a long time to get there. Despite the dominance of the
U.S., sterling remained the most important currency until World War
II. Pro-euro commentators believe the dollar and the euro will each
handle 40 percent of world finance eventually.
</P>
<P>
   10. The euro symbol suggests civilization and stability.
</P>
<P>
   The E with two bars is a homage to the Greek letter epsilon,
representing the cradle of civilization, and, more prosaically, the
E of Europe. The two straight bars represent the stability of the
currency (we hope). &QL;

<P>
   LONDON _ We're all sick of the euro _ and trading in the new
currency hasn't even begun yet. But it is going to dominate the
political and economic agenda in 1999, so you may as well find out
what all the fuss is about.
</P>
<P>
   Make it your New Year's Resolution to learn 10 interesting
things about the euro.
</P>
<P>
   1. Yes, this crazy idea was dreamed up in the Sixties.
</P>
<P>
   Back then, the UK was not a member of what we called the Common
Market. We looked on as the usual sandal-wearing suspects (France,
Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium and Luxembourg _ plus Italy)
decided to make economic love, not war.
</P>
<P>
   In 1969 the European Summit approved a proposal to create an
Economic and Monetary Union (EMU). The plans were expected to take
10 years. Thirty years later...
</P>
<P>
   2. Half the U.K. population has no idea what is going on.
</P>
<P>
   Last month the BBC2 Money Program polled 1,000 representative
people and found 51 percent were unable to name the new single
currency. Good guesses included ``Curo'' and ``Eu.'' Fashionable
guesses included ``Ecru.'' Only hopeless people guessed
``Equarder.'' Asked how much one euro was worth in Real Money,
estimates varied from 1p to (pounds sterling)8. In fact it's about
70p.
</P>
<P>
   3. The euro will make life cheaper.
</P>
<P>
   Because the U.K. is no longer isolated, we'll be aware how much
more we pay for food and clothes. With any luck, retailers will
have to respond by dropping prices. The Internet boom will also
mean you'll be able to order cheaper euro-goods from abroad using a
credit card.
</P>
<P>
   4. You can carry a million pounds' worth of euros in one
briefcase.
</P>
<P>
   There will be a 500 euro note, worth (pounds sterling)350. Which
would mean (pounds sterling)1 million in euros could conveniently
fit in a briefcase. A million pounds in (pounds sterling)50 notes
would take up four cases, which attracts attention.
</P>
<P>
   The euro is the ideal way to carry your ill-gotten gains around
a Europe without internal borders. This is just one of many reasons
why the euro may displace the dollar as the international
criminal's currency of choice. To combat this, Europol _ the new
police force of Euroland _ started work last October.
</P>
<P>
   5. Those old-fashioned currencies are already dead.
</P>
<P>
   Shoppers and workers from Paris to Pisa will handle their francs
and lire until 2002, but the business side of these currencies is
in effect dead. The value of each currency against the euro was
fixed last Thursday and that's where it will stay forever.
</P>
<P>
   From Monday, businesses across Europe will accept cash in the
local currency but will run all their payment and accounting
systems in euros. Government and corporate bond issues will be in
euros, although each issuer will still be able to set the interest
rates it pays on its bonds.
</P>
<P>
   6. You can impress your neighbors with a euro-mortgage.
</P>
<P>
   Barclays and Abbey National have the first euro-mortgage deals,
with an interest rate reflecting the European Central Bank rate of
3 percent across Euroland (except Italy). This gives a
euro-mortgage rate of about 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   That sounds good when you are paying U.K. variable rates of 7.6
percent, but if sterling collapsed against the euro, your payments
would be worth dramatically less. You would have to pay more each
month to compensate for the lower value of each pound paid.
</P>
<P>
   7. Six people have supreme power over 300 million others.
</P>
<P>
   Six executives control the European Central Bank (ECB), oversee
the single currency and set interest rates. They can't be sacked
for eight years, and officially they only have to report to the
European Parliament once a year. Scary.
</P>
<P>
   8. Delaying euro notes and coins until 2002 is a ploy to deter
criminals.
</P>
<P>
   When euros appear in 2002, Europeans will be used to the idea
and won't (allegedly) get confused. So it will be harder to palm
off faked notes, or short-change customers.
</P>
<P>
   Each country will have up to six months to phase out its old
currency in favor of universal euro notes plus coins bearing a
national symbol. All euro notes have gates and windows on the front
_ ``symbols of openness and cooperation in the EU.'' On the back
you'll see a bridge from a particular age _ ``a metaphor for
communication among the people of Europe.'' These are generic
bridges, so no one is offended. One of the original designs showed
a bridge that looked too French; it was scrapped.
</P>
<P>
   9. Euroland is the size of the U.S.
</P>
<P>
   Even without Britain, the single currency zone compares well to
the States. Its economic output was almost equal to the U.S. before
the launch of the euro, and most of Europe (though not Britain) is
now growing faster than the U.S.
</P>
<P>
   If the euro does challenge the dollar as a world currency, it
will take a long time to get there. Despite the dominance of the
U.S., sterling remained the most important currency until World War
II. Pro-euro commentators believe the dollar and the euro will each
handle 40 percent of world finance eventually.
</P>
<P>
   10. The euro symbol suggests civilization and stability.
</P>
<P>
   The E with two bars is a homage to the Greek letter epsilon,
representing the cradle of civilization, and, more prosaically, the
E of Europe. The two straight bars represent the stability of the
currency (we hope). &QL;

SCIENCE FICTION WIRTERS MAY HAVE ENVISIONED THE FUTURE
OF  TECHNOLOGY  
 BY DAVID EINSTEIN
</HEADLINE>
 CHRON - FUTURE   &HT;     c. 1998 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bill Gates or Steve Jobs might be able to guess what computers
will be like in a few years. But if you want insights into the
technology of the next century or two, the place to go is science
fiction.
</P>
<P>
   Sci-fi writers have proven prescient many times. Jules Verne
penned a 19th century story about a trip to the moon. In 1931,
``Brave New World'' by Aldous Huxley presaged Prozac. And George
Orwell, in his 1948 masterpiece ``1984,'' envisioned a time when
the government could use technology to keep track of people.
</P>
<P>
   Today's science fiction is no less instructive. In fact, it
often tells us where we're going before we get there. In his 1984
novel, ``Ender's Game,'' Orson Scott Card described a global
network eerily similar to the Internet _ almost a decade before the
arrival of the World Wide Web. One of Card's protagonists uses the
equivalent of Internet newsgroups to distribute propaganda and
become the most powerful man in the world.
</P>
<P>
   One reason why science fiction sometimes foretells science fact
is that many modern writers in the genre are accomplished
scientists. David Brin and Gregory Benford, two of the most
successful sci-fi writers on the scene, are both physicists. Brin
has a doctorate in astrophysics and has served as a consultant to
NASA. Benford teaches physics at the University of California at
Irvine.
</P>
<P>
   This is not to say that all modern science fiction has the ring
of potential truth. There's still a lot of stuff that challenges
the imagination. Writers routinely disregard the known limits of
physics, for instance, to send space travelers flying faster than
the speed of light. In their defense, it's the only way you can get
across the galaxy, which is thousands of light years from end to
end.
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly, however, the stuff of science fiction is merely an
incremental step into the future, requiring no great leap of faith.
That's because the technological revolution has spawned ideas and
devices that themselves would have qualified as science fiction a
few years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Many technology companies and government research agencies are
hard at work developing things that even Jules Verne would have
considered far-fetched. Microsoft, for instance, has experimented
with ways to use the human nervous system to control a computer. At
IBM's Almaden Research Lab in San Jose, there's a project to create
a computer capable of understanding human expression. And SRI in
Menlo Park is hard at work on artificial intelligence.
</P>
<P>
   Still, science fiction usually is a step ahead of reality. Here
are a few of the most enticing innovations rippling through today's
sci-fi literature:
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Intelligent Agents: The glut of information on the Internet already
has spawned the development of rudimentary programs that can go out
and sift through mounds of data to find stuff that's important to
you. In the future, these programs, called intelligent agents, will
be essential sidekicks, bringing you news, prioritizing your e-mail
and doing research.
</P>
<P>
   In his book, ``Earth,'' Brin calls such agents ferrets. Tad
Williams, in ``Otherland,'' takes it a step further with an
intelligent agent that takes the form of a mechanical pet. It talks
in a human voice, plugs itself into an outlet when it gets tired
and has wireless access to just about any public network.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Artificial Intelligence: Computers that think like humans have been
a staple of science iction for years. The late Isaac Asimov
immortalized them in the form of robots. One in particular, named
Daneel (cq)  &LR; Olivaw, plays a central role in guiding humanity
through thousands of years of turmoil in the ``Foundation'' series.
</P>
<P>
   Today's chief proponent of sentient computers is Greg Bear, who
calls them thinkers. In his work, they're basically supercomputers
that have become self-aware.
</P>
<P>
   Most scientists believe that it will be decades before computers
can approach the thought processes of humans, and nobody expects
them to have an id or an ego. But a generation ago, no one would
have foreseen a computer handily beating the world chess champion,
either.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Nanotechnology: Nothing has captured the fascination of modern
sci-fi writers like nanotechnology, microscopic machines made of
biological material. In the real world, it's being developed for
medical and industrial purposes. In the not-too-distant future,
nanotech could be used to repair a blocked artery or a damaged
kidney without surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Science fiction has had a field day with nanotech. Bear writes
in ``Slant'' about material that fashions itself into complex
weapons. In William Gibson's ``Idoru,'' nanotech is used to build
buildings. And Neal Stephenson makes it the central theme of ``The
Diamond Age,'' in which entire residential areas are constructed
using it.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Bioengineering and Implants: Gibson, Bear and others write of a
time when medical science and computer science will blend,
providing fascinating new ways to enhance the human body. Implants
will let us live longer and improve the equipment that nature gave
us. Implanted microprocessors, for instance, could give us better
vision or control over our emotions, or the ability to easily
understand complex mathematics.
</P>
<P>
   Today, you can have an identity chip implanted in your cat or
dog. And no less a light than physicist Stephen Hawking predicts
that the next frontier for science will be the re-engineering of
human DNA.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
_Virtual Reality: Although it's a hot topic in the technology
press, virtual reality so far has been limited to experimental
video games and esoteric government research. It has remained for
Gibson to define the shape it eventually could take.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Neuromancer,'' the seminal work about cyberspace, he
sketched a near-future in which virtual reality is nearly
indistinguishable from reality itself. Put the electrodes on your
head or the goggles over your eyes and dive into a world of danger
and intrigue, where you can be a hero or get your brain fried.
</P>
<P>
   Stephenson, in ``Snow Crash,'' creates an entire virtual city in
cyberspace where much of the action takes place. And incredibly
sophisticated online virtual reality games are the main settings in
``Otherland,'' as well as Alexander Besher's ``Rim.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
_Superluminal Travel: At the heart of much science fiction is the
idea that outer space can be navigated like just another freeway.
Writers have cooked up any number of easily explained theories to
allow us to break the light-speed barrier.
</P>
<P>
   Captain Kirk simply says, ``Maximum warp,'' and Captain Picard
intones, ``Make it so.'' Asimov got around the problem with what he
called ``the jump,'' which let you hop through space like a kid on
a pogo stick.
</P>
<P>
   It's not so easy. Light zooms along at 186,000 miles per second,
and so far, the best our rockets can muster is less than 25,000
miles per hour. Not only that, but the laws of physics say nothing
can go faster than light. Period.
</P>
<P>
   There are, however, several theories endorsed by top physicists
that could make FTL (faster than light) travel possible. For
instance, because space curves in on itself, it may be possible to
use ``worm holes'' or other anomalies to disappear in one region of
the universe and reappear in another.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, that sounds more like science fiction than most
science fiction. But if science has taught us anything, it's that
if you can think of something, it probably can be done. Stay tuned.
</P>

BRUISED INTEL TO FIGHT BACK  
 BY DAN FOST
</HEADLINE>
 CHRON - INTEL   &HT;     c. 1998 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The continuing competition between computer chipmakers Intel
Corp. and Advanced Micro Devices will flare up again today, when
Intel announces faster chips for cheap computers.
</P>
<P>
   Although AMD bruised Intel in 1998, winning some market share
and returning to profitability, Intel is fighting back in a big
way. The Santa Clara giant, the world's largest chipmaker, will
launch a New Year's assault by bringing out products that are more
powerful, cost less and reach the marketplace sooner than its
earlier offerings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whenever Intel stumbles, AMD has a bigger opportunity,'' said
analyst Mona Eraiba, cq  &LR; with Gruntal and Co. in New York. ``But it
appears Intel has picked itself up and is performing.''
</P>
<P>
   While the two companies battle, consumers stand to benefit
because faster, cheaper chips mean faster, cheaper personal
computers.
</P>
<P>
   In a meeting with the business media today in San Francisco, cq
 &LR; Intel Executive Vice President Paul Otellini is expected to unveil
a new version of its Celeron chip. The Celeron was Intel's belated
entry into the inexpensive end of the PC marketplace, introduced in
April after AMD and National Semiconductor's Cyrix unit established
the popularity of PCs that sell for less than $1,000.
</P>
<P>
   Intel Chairman Andy Grove has acknowledged that the company
missed a significant market shift to sub-$1,000 PCs. The challenge
for Intel is how to compete at the low end of the market while
still selling chips at its accustomed high profit margins. In other
words, will a 400 MHz Celeron _ to be unveiled today _ eat into
sales of pricier Pentium IIs at similar speeds?
</P>
<P>
   ``If (Intel) pushes Celeron too hard, it will eat into its sales
of higher-priced chips,'' said Fred Zieber, president of Pathfinder
Research, a semiconductor analysis firm in San Jose. Although
Intel's first Celerons were a flop _ they performed slower than
comparable chips _ the company quickly fixed the chip by making it
faster. Intel reported strong Celeron sales by the holiday season.
</P>
<P>
   Intel's work continues: Analysts say the company originally
planned to put the 400 MHz Celeron on the market in June or July,
then moved the date up to March or April and then moved it up again
to this week. Until today, the fastest Celeron in stores was 333
MHz. The company cut Celeron prices last month by about 30 percent
to reflect new manufacturing efficiencies.
</P>
<P>
   Celeron is a brand-new brand name, said Mike Sullivan, an Intel
spokesman. ``We need to build consumer awareness and consumer
preference, in addition to making it even faster and more
affordable.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, according to Mercury Research, an Arizona firm that
tracks the semiconductor industry, AMD has eroded some of Intel's
strength. In the third quarter, Intel's share of the sub-$1,000 PC
market dropped from 68 percent to 56 percent, while AMD's share
rose from 19.5 percent to 24.1 percent, Mercury analyst Mike Feibus
reported.
</P>
<P>
   But Intel still is the dominant chipmaker. Zieber, at Pathfinder
Research, said Intel still holds 96 percent of the consumer
microprocessor market.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; ``Even though AMD has garnered a fair amount of market share
at some price points, they've got a long way to go to make major
inroads into Intel's profits,'' Zieber said.
</P>
<P>
   AMD, in Sunnyvale, hopes to move into Intel's bread-and-butter,
the performance PCs. Those computers, most of which contain Intel
Pentium II chips, sell to businesses and home users who are doing
more than just word processing and surfing the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   AMD's next chip, code-named Sharptooth, could give Intel some
competition, according to Anand Lal Shimpi, who runs a Web site
that analyzes computer hardware,  &LR; www.anandtech.com &LR; . Shimpi, a
16-year-old junior at Enloe High School in Raleigh, N.C., said a
person close to AMD gave him the Sharptooth chip, which he doesn't
expect to hit shelves until February.
</P>
<P>
   AMD will say only that Sharptooth will be out in the first
quarter of this year. The chip, which Shimpi anticipates will be
called the K6-3, ``is very promising,'' he said. ``It doesn't look
like there's any downside to the K6-3.''
</P>
<P>
   Feibus, at Mercury Research, said the K6-3 will be ``a hot
product.'' He expects that it will sell in the $200 range, which is
high for an AMD chip.
</P>
<P>
   AMD isn't giving specifics yet, except to say it's added cache
to the popular K6-2 chip. Cache is high-speed memory built next to
the main processor, making for faster retrieval of frequently used
information.
</P>
<P>
   ``It comes as no surprise that Intel has done what it said it
was going to do,'' said AMD spokesman Scott Allen. ``We've been
competing with them forever. The key to our success has been
execution, which has been excellent _ cross your fingers _ and the
value proposition.''
</P>
<P>
   AMD plans to continue to offer chips that either sell for less
than similarly performing Intel chips or outperform Intel chips at
the same price level. Its K-7 chip, the next competitor for the
Pentium II, will be out by June, Allen said. ``I think we're
looking at a real interesting 1999,'' he said.

 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ We're all sick of the euro _ and trading in the new
currency hasn't even begun yet. But it is going to dominate the
political and economic agenda in 1999, so you may as well find out
what all the fuss is about.
</P>
<P>
   Make it your New Year's Resolution to learn 10 interesting
things about the euro.
</P>
<P>
   1. Yes, this crazy idea was dreamed up in the Sixties.
</P>
<P>
   Back then, the UK was not a member of what we called the Common
Market. We looked on as the usual sandal-wearing suspects (France,
Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium and Luxembourg _ plus Italy)
decided to make economic love, not war.
</P>
<P>
   In 1969 the European Summit approved a proposal to create an
Economic and Monetary Union (EMU). The plans were expected to take
10 years. Thirty years later...
</P>
<P>
   2. Half the U.K. population has no idea what is going on.
</P>
<P>
   Last month the BBC2 Money Program polled 1,000 representative
people and found 51 percent were unable to name the new single
currency. Good guesses included ``Curo'' and ``Eu.'' Fashionable
guesses included ``Ecru.'' Only hopeless people guessed
``Equarder.'' Asked how much one euro was worth in Real Money,
estimates varied from 1p to (pounds sterling)8. In fact it's about
70p.
</P>
<P>
   3. The euro will make life cheaper.
</P>
<P>
   Because the U.K. is no longer isolated, we'll be aware how much
more we pay for food and clothes. With any luck, retailers will
have to respond by dropping prices. The Internet boom will also
mean you'll be able to order cheaper euro-goods from abroad using a
credit card.
</P>
<P>
   4. You can carry a million pounds' worth of euros in one
briefcase.
</P>
<P>
   There will be a 500 euro note, worth (pounds sterling)350. Which
would mean (pounds sterling)1 million in euros could conveniently
fit in a briefcase. A million pounds in (pounds sterling)50 notes
would take up four cases, which attracts attention.
</P>
<P>
   The euro is the ideal way to carry your ill-gotten gains around
a Europe without internal borders. This is just one of many reasons
why the euro may displace the dollar as the international
criminal's currency of choice. To combat this, Europol _ the new
police force of Euroland _ started work last October.
</P>
<P>
   5. Those old-fashioned currencies are already dead.
</P>
<P>
   Shoppers and workers from Paris to Pisa will handle their francs
and lire until 2002, but the business side of these currencies is
in effect dead. The value of each currency against the euro was
fixed last Thursday and that's where it will stay forever.
</P>
<P>
   From Monday, businesses across Europe will accept cash in the
local currency but will run all their payment and accounting
systems in euros. Government and corporate bond issues will be in
euros, although each issuer will still be able to set the interest
rates it pays on its bonds.
</P>
<P>
   6. You can impress your neighbors with a euro-mortgage.
</P>
<P>
   Barclays and Abbey National have the first euro-mortgage deals,
with an interest rate reflecting the European Central Bank rate of
3 percent across Euroland (except Italy). This gives a
euro-mortgage rate of about 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   That sounds good when you are paying U.K. variable rates of 7.6
percent, but if sterling collapsed against the euro, your payments
would be worth dramatically less. You would have to pay more each
month to compensate for the lower value of each pound paid.
</P>
<P>
   7. Six people have supreme power over 300 million others.
</P>
<P>
   Six executives control the European Central Bank (ECB), oversee
the single currency and set interest rates. They can't be sacked
for eight years, and officially they only have to report to the
European Parliament once a year. Scary.
</P>
<P>
   8. Delaying euro notes and coins until 2002 is a ploy to deter
criminals.
</P>
<P>
   When euros appear in 2002, Europeans will be used to the idea
and won't (allegedly) get confused. So it will be harder to palm
off faked notes, or short-change customers.
</P>
<P>
   Each country will have up to six months to phase out its old
currency in favor of universal euro notes plus coins bearing a
national symbol. All euro notes have gates and windows on the front
_ ``symbols of openness and cooperation in the EU.'' On the back
you'll see a bridge from a particular age _ ``a metaphor for
communication among the people of Europe.'' These are generic
bridges, so no one is offended. One of the original designs showed
a bridge that looked too French; it was scrapped.
</P>
<P>
   9. Euroland is the size of the U.S.
</P>
<P>
   Even without Britain, the single currency zone compares well to
the States. Its economic output was almost equal to the U.S. before
the launch of the euro, and most of Europe (though not Britain) is
now growing faster than the U.S.
</P>
<P>
   If the euro does challenge the dollar as a world currency, it
will take a long time to get there. Despite the dominance of the
U.S., sterling remained the most important currency until World War
II. Pro-euro commentators believe the dollar and the euro will each
handle 40 percent of world finance eventually.
</P>
<P>
   10. The euro symbol suggests civilization and stability.
</P>
<P>
   The E with two bars is a homage to the Greek letter epsilon,
representing the cradle of civilization, and, more prosaically, the
E of Europe. The two straight bars represent the stability of the
currency (we hope). &QL;

The answer is in the e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   For many consumers, getting the skinny from their financial
institution or the nearby computer store has become a matter of
tapping a PC keyboard instead of punching a phone pad.
</P>
<P>
   That's because banks and other service-intensive companies
increasingly are investing in automated e-mail software packages to
answer a deluge of questions from customers _ many of whom are
logging on in record numbers to corporate Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   The information age rages on.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been a major influx of e-mail,'' says Cameron King,
executive vice president of Countrywide Home Loans, a Pasadena
mortgage company. ``With this technology, we can process up to
1,000 queries a day. Before, we had one person individually answer
e-mail inquiries.''
</P>
<P>
   Manually routing and answering e-mail can be time-consuming and
expensive. High-tech firm Forrester Research places the cost of
dealing with each message at $2.75.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet can be either the least expensive or the most
expensive customer channel,'' says Brightware CEO Chuck Williams.
``Using specialized software can reduce the cost of dealing with
e-mail questions and feedback to as little as 25 cents apiece.''
</P>
<P>
   Brightware of Novato is one of several software-makers that has
developed technology that lets big businesses answer e-mail
questions from customers within seconds. The
artificial-intelligence program is used by Wells Fargo, Egghead
Software and others with major Web sites to ease the
service-support headaches caused by thousands of e-mail messages.
The programs typically answer repetitive customer-service requests
like bank balances or the status of orders.
</P>
<P>
   Here's why: E-mail avoids the per-minute charge of a phone call,
is widely available, can be answered quickly and complements the
Web site.
</P>
<P>
   It does come at a cost, though. Setting up a service or
assigning someone to answer or delegate the torrent of e-mails is
pricey, and most customers don't like generic replies to e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   Auto-reply systems from Brightware and Aptex Software go for
$75,000 to $150,000.
</P>
<P>
   Voice vendors Lucent Technologies and Aspect Telecommunications
are expected to integrate e-mail capabilities into their systems
during the next two years.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; sth  &LR; DEPT. OF CLARIFICATIONS: A perturbed Wade Randlett,
Democratic political adviser for TechNet, called to chide me for
last week's item on Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Randlett took umbrage at suggestions that the VP wasn't
tech-savvy because he had yet to register Web addresses bearing his
name for a certain presidential run in 2000. He says Gore merely
was following federal election law.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until he announces and files for the presidential nomination,
he can't spend a dime on his campaign, and that includes
registering domain names,'' Randlett says. ``You don't horse around
with federal election law. If anything, Vice President Gore was
being law-savvy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real problem is a system that lets citizens secure the
rights to domain names and then offer them to the highest bidder,''
he says.
</P>
<P>
   Ted Weinstein, the San Francisco man who registered several Web
addresses with Gore 2000 references, says he merely was securing
them before they were snapped up by political foes. He is offering
them to the Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, there are scores of ``cyber-squatters'' whose
motives aren't as honorable. Many selfishly hoard domain names
containing famous monikers, such as Madonna.com or Computer.com,
with &UR;  &LR; the intent of auctioning them off.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Microsoft last week sued a pair of companies _
TexasRGV.com and TrademarkDomains.com _ for trademark infringement
for registering such online addresses as  &LR; www.microsoftwindows.com &LR; 
and  &LR; www.microsoftoffice.com &LR; .

Atbigger.net couldn't get any stranger, check out this latest
dispatch from the online world's version of ``The Twilight Zone.''

   The Web site of Brigadoon.com, the financially challenged
Internet service provider that acquired the bankrupt Atbigger.net
last year, posted the following message last week: ``Our e-mail
server has been hacked. The nature of the attack prohibits you from
logging on to e-mail. We realize how maddening this is for you all.
We have someone working as fast as possible to rebuild the server.
Please stand by for more updates.''
</P>
<P>
   If your memory needs refreshing, Atbigger.net is the San Jose

two years ago.

LOS ANGELES SUBURBS READY FOR SECESSION

 c.1999 The Independent, London

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Los Angeles is the city that everyone loves to
hate _ including, it seems, 200,000 of its own inhabitants.
</P>
<P>
   That's how many people have signed a petition calling for the
secession of the San Fernando Valley, the suburban slice of Los
Angeles north of the Hollywood Hills, and the creation of what
could become the sixth largest city in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The reasons for the rebellion will sound reassuringly familiar
to LA-bashers: the desire to get away from an unwieldy city
bureaucracy that sucks in tax money but does little or nothing
about shoddy schools, public transport, air pollution, inner-city
crime and all the other ills for which Los Angeles has become a
byword.
</P>
<P>
   Or at least that's the way the secessionists portray it. Their
drive is also being seen as a giant manifestation of that very
Californian ideology, Not In My Back Yard.
</P>
<P>
   Being a predominantly white, middle-class part of town, the
Valley is simply sick of shelling out for minorities and the poor
in the downtown areas and would much rather spend its tax money on
typically white, middle-class things like raising the tone of its
neighborhoods and nudging property values upwards.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Valley is tired of being treated like a cash cow,''
acknowledges Richard Close, chairman of the Valley VOTE movement
which is spearheading the push for secession. So far his group has
been remarkably successful.
</P>
<P>
   The petition will _ if two-thirds of the signatures are verified
_ lead to a ballot initiative proposing secession some time in the
next couple of years. Independence wouldn't arrive in time for the
millennium, but could become a reality shortly afterwards.
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles area is full of smaller independent mini-cities
which believe they can manage their affairs better on their own _
Beverly Hills being perhaps the most famous example.
</P>
<P>
   In every case, the push for cityhood is essentially a desire to
keep the riffraff out. The Valley, with its 1.6 million
inhabitants, is exceptional only because of its size.
</P>
<P>
   ``Overtly, secession is about better civic management, but in
reality it is about maintaining a white majority and protecting
house prices,'' said Jim Newton, an experienced political reporter
for the Los Angeles Times.
</P>
<P>
   The Valley, with its estate agent mentality, is well-versed in
the art of secession already: several communities over the years
have chosen to split or rename themselves in an effort to up the
tone.
</P>
<P>
   When the eastern end of Canoga Park was hit by a crime wave in
the mid-1980s, the ritzier western end changed its name to West
Hills _ sparking a furious battle over where exactly the
demarcation line between the two should be drawn.
</P>
<P>
   A few years later the undesirably Hispanic-sounding neighborhood
of Sepulveda became North Hills, even though the highest hills in
the place were speed bumps.
</P>
<P>
   Two tiny fractions of North Hollywood turned into Valley Village
and West Toluca Lake because the word ``Hollywood'' evokes images
of crime and dingy streets. Never mind that West Toluca Lake was
nowhere near Toluca Lake _ it sounded good.
</P>
<P>
   Now the western half of Van Nuys, which is divided by a major
freeway, wants to split off from the eastern half because of drugs
and gang problems. ``We're embarrassed to say we live here,'' says
Steve Neuman, the real estate agent behind the initiative.
</P>
<P>
   With that sort of community spirit, the Valley may not just
become a separate city, it may become 25 separate cities. &QL;

   VIENNA _ It's 9:15 a.m. and, just as they have done every Sunday
since 1498, 24 child singers from the Vienna Boys Choir climb the
spiral stairs of the tiny Imperial Chapel of Vienna's Hofburg
Palace, former seat of the Habsburg rulers, and take their places
in the choir gallery.
</P>
<P>
   Outside, it is -5C and the quadrangle in front of the 13th
century church is like a skating rink. But the fur-wearing Viennese
mass-goers and intrepid Japanese tourists delighted to have secured
tickets to hear the angelic voices at close range are queuing.
</P>
<P>
   Disappointingly, the boys are concealed from view and the
tourists have to crane their necks to catch a glimpse. The
atmosphere is only slightly marred when a man enters the chapel
afterwards, brandishing CD recordings of the choir.
</P>
<P>
   Eleven-year-old Reinhard Gabriel, in navy coat and sailor hat,
gets ready to go home for Sunday lunch with his father, Helmut.
Next year he sets off on a tour covering every major European city,
but Gabriel says it's worth it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course he misses us but even when he's in Vienna we only
see him twice a week. And he has the right attitude. He will do
it.'' The family has already made sacrifices for Reinhard by moving
from Linz to Vienna.
</P>
<P>
   The 18th-century Augarten Palace, once a Habsburg residence, is
now the boarding-school home of the choir. Behind its high walls
the gardens and playing fields echo to childish shouts and the soft
thud of snowballs hitting woolly coats.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the baroque palace, the school principal, Manfred Seipt,
sits in his office, wondering where the choir will get its next
artistic director from.
</P>
<P>
   The truth is that 500 years after Emperor Maximilian I recruited
12 boys by decree into the royal musical household, this unique
institution is in crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Its image took a battering a month ago when Agnes Grossman, the
choir's first female artistic director, said the boys were
exhausted, overworked, ruthlessly exploited for commercial profit
and being robbed of their childhood.
</P>
<P>
   The claim shocked Vienna, provoking debate about what the choir
represents. Linked to such figures as Mozart, Haydn and Schubert
(who was in the choir), it has become a symbol of the city's
musical heritage. But with no state subsidy since the collapse of
the empire in 1918, it has increasingly had to rely on commercial
activities.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Grossman, awarded a Silver Cross by the state for services
to the arts, resigned after an internal feud about the length of
foreign tours (typically two to three months) and the vulgarization
of the repertoire.
</P>
<P>
   It should not have been like this, on the choir's 500th
anniversary. A three-month U.S. tour overseen by Ms. Grossman was
an artistic triumph.
</P>
<P>
   Music critics, worried about the decline in recent years, hailed
the choir's return to its serious musical heritage and original
mission. Now all that is in doubt again.
</P>
<P>
   Many parents are unsettled and have taken up Ms. Grossman's
demands for a reduction in tours and concerts. For years they
remained silent but now admit they are heartbroken to see their
10-year-olds disappear on tour for three-and-a-half months of the
year.
</P>
<P>
   The Augarten was in festive mood as Christmas approached but
there is a heavy schedule ahead of the boys in the Haydn choir, who
are not on tour (the other three choirs are).
</P>
<P>
   Schoolwork has to be compressed into eight-week terms to fit in
the travel, but these are gifted boys, the elite of Austria's
musical youth.
</P>
<P>
   Lucio Golio, a tutor, is playing part of Mozart's Coronation
Mass on a grand piano. Five sopranos, in track suits and slippers,
study their scores. Lucio makes them repeat a difficult phrase over
and over, crying ``Bravissimo!'' when they get it right.
</P>
<P>
   It's not exactly as it was in the days of Schubert. In the
recreation area, older boys are huddled over Gameboys. A few more
are watching skiing on television. Over the beds in the
dormitories, Pamela Anderson and the Spice Girls adorn the walls.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are normal boys,'' says Seipt. ``We have even caught boys
smoking.'' But few normal boys get flown to Germany to take part in
a Christmas special of the country's most popular television show.
</P>
<P>
   Lionel Ritchie was supposed to accompany them, only he was
struck down with hoarseness, leaving 20 million viewers
disappointed. Instead, the choir sang a jazzed-up version of
``Silent Night.'' &QL;

MARSHALL PERLIN, LAWYER IN ROSENBERG SPY CASE, DIES AT 79 
 (DW)
</HEADLINE>
  By WOLFGANG SAXON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Marshall Perlin, a civil-liberties lawyer who was
engaged on a decades-long quest to keep the Rosenberg spy case in
the national consciousness, died last Thursday at New York
Hospital-Cornell Medical Center. He was 79 and lived in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   He suffered a brief illness, his family said.
</P>
<P>
   Perlin did his most famous work representing the sons of Julius
and Ethel Rosenberg and Morton Sobell, the Rosenbergs'
co-defendant. The couple, accused of plotting to pass atomic bomb
secrets to the Soviet Union, were convicted and electrocuted at
Sing Sing prison in 1953. Sobell spent 18{ years in federal prison
before he was paroled.
</P>
<P>
   Perlin entered the scene after the sentencing. He argued court
motions that resulted in the public release of hundreds of
thousands of pages of documents on the Rosenberg case and helped
change the way the FBI handled documents.
</P>
<P>
   Perlin pursued Sobell's appeals of his original 30-year sentence
and served as counsel to the Rosenbergs' children, Robert and
Michael Meeropol, who use their adoptive parents' surname. In an
effort undertaken at their request to have the case reopened and
prove the couple were framed, he began in the mid-1970s to
challenge the FBI, the Justice Department, the CIA and other
offices to release classified documents. He was armed with the
Freedom of Information Act, which had become law a decade earlier,
long after the trial.
</P>
<P>
   The government reluctantly surrendered the files. At the time of
his death, Perlin was still trying to fill in gaps in documents
that had pages, paragraphs, phrases or names blanked out or omitted
when they were released.
</P>
<P>
   The collection of Rosenberg files, now known as the Perlin
Papers, is stored at Columbia Law School.
</P>
<P>
   Perlin also brought a suit on behalf of the American Friends
Service Committee and four dozen other groups and individuals,
seeking to oblige the FBI to follow a standard retention system for
documents that applies to other federal agencies. The FBI formerly
had a policy of throwing out or keeping records with little
oversight.
</P>
<P>
   The action was brought in U. S. District Court in Washington and
was upheld on appeal. A commonly used retention system provides
certain rules by which government officials determine which records
can be discarded, which should be kept for a certain period of time
and which are of enough historical value to be stored at the
National Archives.
</P>
<P>
   Perlin's other clients included labor unions and people accused
of disloyalty or subversion during the McCarthy era in the 1950s.
</P>
<P>
   Perlin was born in Manhattan and graduated from Rutgers
University. He finished Columbia Law School in 1942, but his degree
was deferred until 1947 while he served in World War II.
</P>
<P>
   He was a first lieutenant and navigator in the Army Air Force,
flying bombing missions in the Pacific. He earned the Distinguished
Flying Cross, the Air Medal with two oak leaf clusters and two
battle stars.
</P>
<P>
   He practiced in several states and tried a case that was
admitted to the U. S. Supreme Court in 1955. Although he had a solo
practice much of the time, he at one time was a partner of Arthur
Kinoy, a retired professor of constitutional law at Rutgers.
</P>
<P>
   Perlin is survived by his wife, Loretta Rowe; a son, Hank Perlin
of New York; and a daughter, Jan Perlin of Brooklyn, N.Y.

 CHRON - DIGITAL BAY   Thanks to Steve Jobs, Mac's Faithful Flock Has a Reason to 
 Believe 
 &HT;     c. 1998 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
The computer world's true believers will descend on San Francisco's
Moscone Center starting tomorrow for the annual Macworld Expo.
</P>
<P>
   For years, it has required a certain suspension of disbelief to
stick with this digital underdog. And even this year, with Apple
Computer finally back in the black and winning acclaim with its
innovative new designs, faith is still the price of admission to
the Mac circle.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, it's faith in Steve Jobs, the unconventional
genius who has led Apple's turnaround.
</P>
<P>
   If one were to pick a song to exemplify Jobs, it would have to
be Frank Sinatra's ``My Way.'' Whereas most companies have chief
executives, Jobs has only accepted the job in an interim capacity.
He has not taken payment for his work. And he holds but a single
share of Apple stock, having sold, at an embarrassingly low rate,
the 1.5 million shares he earned when former CEO Gil Amelio brought
him back into the company.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, ironically, Jobs has not profitted financially from the
tripling of shareholder value that his own leadership has wrought.
</P>
<P>
   What Jobs' success has purchased, however, is an outpouring of
praise for his leadership and, more importantly, a respite from the
annoying question that has plagued Apple for years _ can it remain
a stand-alone company or must it merge to survive in today's
bigger-is-better corporate world?
</P>
<P>
   I'm not suggesting that Apple is sick. To the contrary, Jobs has
taken a company that was bleeding and patched it up. But he did so
mainly by amputating thousands of jobs and several superfluous
products in order to make a smaller but stronger company. Nowhere
else in today's corporate world is smallness considered a virtue.
</P>
<P>
   And even when Apple was twice its present size in sales and
market share, analysts were wondering whether the company could go
it alone forever. It still seems to be a question that begs an
answer.
</P>
<P>
   But not the least of Jobs' accomplishments is the fact that he
has taken complete control of Apple's public agenda. Whereas his
predecessors were always responding to outside criticism or events,
Jobs has scripted every step in the turnaround, deciding which
questions to answer and when, silencing critics with his imperious
personality _ backed up by the verdict of Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   So I'll shut up, too, other than to opine that Apple cannot
survive indefinitely on its own and that Jobs, in his own secretive
fashion, is probably out there right now trying to conjure up some
deal that preserves the company's creative essence and rewards
shareholders _ while enhancing his own reputation.
</P>
<P>
   That last point is no small consideration because all available
evidence indicates that Jobs has a huge, if unusual, ego. There's
no reason to believe he that cares what you or I might think, but
he does seem concerned with the verdict of history. In interviews,
he has a habit of talking about what will or won't ``change the
world.''
</P>
<P>
   By that, I don't think he means ending hunger or bringing peace
to the planet. Jobs' world is the world of computing. And in that
universe, the thing that's really changed is the relative position
of Steve Jobs and Bill Gates.
</P>
<P>
   Once, Jobs towered like Zeus above the landscape of computing.
Gates was one of the satyrs prancing at his feet. The 1997 Macworld
show in Boston offered a visual reminder of their role reversal,
when the televised image of Gates dwarfed the real-life Jobs, who
drew jeers for announcing Microsoft's token investment in Apple.
</P>
<P>
   If you buy the notion that Jobs feels a compulsion to retake the
digital heights, take another step down the speculative path.
Imagine Disney as the buyer in a merger-a-trois with Apple and
Pixar that makes Jobs heir-apparent to Michael Eisner _ giving him
an empire that could over-awe Gates.
</P>
<P>
   OK, OK, so this sounds nuttier than most screenplays. But a
little more than two years ago, before Amelio bought NeXT Inc.,
wouldn't you have scoffed at a prediction that we'd be heading into
Macworld '99 with Steve Jobs at the head of Apple?

10 TUB-THUMPING FACTS ABOUT THE EURO

 c.1999 The Independent, London  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ We're all sick of the euro _ and trading in the new
currency hasn't even begun yet. But it is going to dominate the
political and economic agenda in 1999, so you may as well find out
what all the fuss is about.
</P>
<P>
   Make it your New Year's Resolution to learn 10 interesting
things about the euro.
</P>
<P>
   1. Yes, this crazy idea was dreamed up in the Sixties.
</P>
<P>
   Back then, the UK was not a member of what we called the Common
Market. We looked on as the usual sandal-wearing suspects (France,
Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium and Luxembourg _ plus Italy)
decided to make economic love, not war.
</P>
<P>
   In 1969 the European Summit approved a proposal to create an
Economic and Monetary Union (EMU). The plans were expected to take
10 years. Thirty years later...
</P>
<P>
   2. Half the U.K. population has no idea what is going on.
</P>
<P>
   Last month the BBC2 Money Program polled 1,000 representative
people and found 51 percent were unable to name the new single
currency. Good guesses included ``Curo'' and ``Eu.'' Fashionable
guesses included ``Ecru.'' Only hopeless people guessed
``Equarder.'' Asked how much one euro was worth in Real Money,
estimates varied from 1p to (pounds sterling)8. In fact it's about
70p.
</P>
<P>
   3. The euro will make life cheaper.
</P>
<P>
   Because the U.K. is no longer isolated, we'll be aware how much
more we pay for food and clothes. With any luck, retailers will
have to respond by dropping prices. The Internet boom will also
mean you'll be able to order cheaper euro-goods from abroad using a
credit card.
</P>
<P>
   4. You can carry a million pounds' worth of euros in one
briefcase.
</P>
<P>
   There will be a 500 euro note, worth (pounds sterling)350. Which
would mean (pounds sterling)1 million in euros could conveniently
fit in a briefcase. A million pounds in (pounds sterling)50 notes
would take up four cases, which attracts attention.
</P>
<P>
   The euro is the ideal way to carry your ill-gotten gains around
a Europe without internal borders. This is just one of many reasons
why the euro may displace the dollar as the international
criminal's currency of choice. To combat this, Europol _ the new
police force of Euroland _ started work last October.
</P>
<P>
   5. Those old-fashioned currencies are already dead.
</P>
<P>
   Shoppers and workers from Paris to Pisa will handle their francs
and lire until 2002, but the business side of these currencies is
in effect dead. The value of each currency against the euro was
fixed last Thursday and that's where it will stay forever.
</P>
<P>
   From Monday, businesses across Europe will accept cash in the
local currency but will run all their payment and accounting
systems in euros. Government and corporate bond issues will be in
euros, although each issuer will still be able to set the interest
rates it pays on its bonds.
</P>
<P>
   6. You can impress your neighbors with a euro-mortgage.
</P>
<P>
   Barclays and Abbey National have the first euro-mortgage deals,
with an interest rate reflecting the European Central Bank rate of
3 percent across Euroland (except Italy). This gives a
euro-mortgage rate of about 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   That sounds good when you are paying U.K. variable rates of 7.6
percent, but if sterling collapsed against the euro, your payments
would be worth dramatically less. You would have to pay more each
month to compensate for the lower value of each pound paid.
</P>
<P>
   7. Six people have supreme power over 300 million others.
</P>
<P>
   Six executives control the European Central Bank (ECB), oversee
the single currency and set interest rates. They can't be sacked
for eight years, and officially they only have to report to the
European Parliament once a year. Scary.
</P>
<P>
   8. Delaying euro notes and coins until 2002 is a ploy to deter
criminals.
</P>
<P>
   When euros appear in 2002, Europeans will be used to the idea
and won't (allegedly) get confused. So it will be harder to palm
off faked notes, or short-change customers.
</P>
<P>
   Each country will have up to six months to phase out its old
currency in favor of universal euro notes plus coins bearing a
national symbol. All euro notes have gates and windows on the front
_ ``symbols of openness and cooperation in the EU.'' On the back
you'll see a bridge from a particular age _ ``a metaphor for
communication among the people of Europe.'' These are generic
bridges, so no one is offended. One of the original designs showed
a bridge that looked too French; it was scrapped.
</P>
<P>
   9. Euroland is the size of the U.S.
</P>
<P>
   Even without Britain, the single currency zone compares well to
the States. Its economic output was almost equal to the U.S. before
the launch of the euro, and most of Europe (though not Britain) is
now growing faster than the U.S.
</P>
<P>
   If the euro does challenge the dollar as a world currency, it
will take a long time to get there. Despite the dominance of the
U.S., sterling remained the most important currency until World War
II. Pro-euro commentators believe the dollar and the euro will each
handle 40 percent of world finance eventually.
</P>
<P>
   10. The euro symbol suggests civilization and stability.
</P>
<P>
   The E with two bars is a homage to the Greek letter epsilon,
representing the cradle of civilization, and, more prosaically, the
E of Europe. The two straight bars represent the stability of the
currency (we hope). &QL;

NOBODY BUDGES, BUT PLAYERS STILL HOPE FOR SEASON
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By MIKE WISE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ With four days left to save the National Basketball
Association season, Billy Hunter wants the owners to negotiate,
David Stern wants the players to capitulate and no one _ neither
the league commissioner nor the union executive director _ is
budging.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're closer than people think,'' Hunter said Sunday night,
adding that he was hopeful that there would be a shortened season.
``We want to negotiate, whether it be in small groups or large
groups. This comes down to whether or not David Stern wants to have
a season. If he doesn't want to negotiate, we'll have none.''
</P>
<P>
   Without a settlement, Stern had said he would recommend to the
league's board of governors at a meeting Thursday in Manhattan that
they scrap the rest of the season. Eight days ago the union
rejected what the league called its final offer in the last round
of talks. After being rebuffed when he requested a meeting, Hunter
has not delivered what he calls the union's final proposal to the
league.
</P>
<P>
   With no talks scheduled it appears both sides are gearing up for
doomsday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing's changed here,'' said Russ Granik, the league's
deputy commissioner. ``We have a meeting on Thursday. If we don't
have a deal, we'll recommend letting the season lapse. Our board
will be happy to have the last offer the players give them. But if
it's not a lot like our last offer, the board will not accept it.''
</P>
<P>
   The union made a better argument for a possible settlement last
week when it divulged part of its final offer, which included
agreeing to the league's concept of capping salaries of all of its
players.
</P>
<P>
   But the two sides remain far apart on total revenue
distribution. The players are wedded to the notion of receiving 57
percent of defined income in the final year of a six-year plan _
the amount that was devoted to salaries last season. The owners
have offered no more than 54 percent in the final three years of
the deal. As total revenue is expected to be $2.5 billion to $3
billion, the gap represents $75 million to $90 million.
</P>
<P>
   A number of other issues remain to be hashed out. These relate
to flexibility for players to move to other teams and to employ
escape clauses in contracts _ issues that the league feels
translate to more income for the players.
</P>
<P>
   Hunter especially has his work cut out for him this week. Beyond
trying to convince the owners to meet with the players and put
together a deal, he has to make sure the union's solidarity remains
intact.
</P>
<P>
   The Philadelphia Inquirer reported that more than 20 players had
contacted the former union president Isiah Thomas about mediating
the dispute and appeared to be interested in putting the owners'
proposal to a vote, something Stern has implored the players to do.
</P>
<P>
   Though the agents for two of the players mentioned, Shaquille
O'Neal and Grant Hill, denied that their clients had spoken to
Thomas, at least five players have publicly asked for the owners'
latest proposal to be put to a vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``If their strategy over the next few days is to gamble whether
there is going to be a vote, we're not going to have a season,''
Hunter said. ``They have made the high-end guys an issue. We gave
them that. I'm ready to talk again. If not, let Stern be the fall
guy. If there is no season, he's responsible for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Hunter said the union's 19-member negotiating committee would be
in Manhattan on Tuesday, leaving only two days for the two sides to
bargain before Thursday's deadline.
</P>
<P>
   More than three months of the season have been lost, and the
players are expected to lose more than $500 million in salaries.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Kerr, a reserve guard for the Chicago Bulls, said the call
for a vote was playing into Stern's hands. ``If I'm going to lose
half a million dollars, let's try and get something good for the
majority of players,'' Kerr said. ``If guys are going to start
calling for a vote, that's their prerogative. But I'm not so sure
it would pass.''
</P>
<P>
   Kerr said he was not only frustrated by the lockout, but also by
the proposals currently on the table.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our whole objective coming in was to help the middle class,''
he said. ``The only thing we've done is bump up the minimum
salaries and probably secure an average salary exception that's
well below the average salary. That's not a whole lot, considering
we've lost half a season.'' &QL;

SCIENCE FICTION WRITERS MAY HAVE ENVISIONED THE FUTURE
OF  TECHNOLOGY  
 BY DAVID EINSTEIN
</HEADLINE>
 CHRON - FUTURE   &HT;     c. 1998 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bill Gates or Steve Jobs might be able to guess what computers
will be like in a few years. But if you want insights into the
technology of the next century or two, the place to go is science
fiction.
</P>
<P>
   Sci-fi writers have proven prescient many times. Jules Verne
penned a 19th century story about a trip to the moon. In 1931,
``Brave New World'' by Aldous Huxley presaged Prozac. And George
Orwell, in his 1948 masterpiece ``1984,'' envisioned a time when
the government could use technology to keep track of people.
</P>
<P>
   Today's science fiction is no less instructive. In fact, it
often tells us where we're going before we get there. In his 1984
novel, ``Ender's Game,'' Orson Scott Card described a global
network eerily similar to the Internet _ almost a decade before the
arrival of the World Wide Web. One of Card's protagonists uses the
equivalent of Internet newsgroups to distribute propaganda and
become the most powerful man in the world.
</P>
<P>
   One reason why science fiction sometimes foretells science fact
is that many modern writers in the genre are accomplished
scientists. David Brin and Gregory Benford, two of the most
successful sci-fi writers on the scene, are both physicists. Brin
has a doctorate in astrophysics and has served as a consultant to
NASA. Benford teaches physics at the University of California at
Irvine.
</P>
<P>
   This is not to say that all modern science fiction has the ring
of potential truth. There's still a lot of stuff that challenges
the imagination. Writers routinely disregard the known limits of
physics, for instance, to send space travelers flying faster than
the speed of light. In their defense, it's the only way you can get
across the galaxy, which is thousands of light years from end to
end.
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly, however, the stuff of science fiction is merely an
incremental step into the future, requiring no great leap of faith.
That's because the technological revolution has spawned ideas and
devices that themselves would have qualified as science fiction a
few years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Many technology companies and government research agencies are
hard at work developing things that even Jules Verne would have
considered far-fetched. Microsoft, for instance, has experimented
with ways to use the human nervous system to control a computer. At
IBM's Almaden Research Lab in San Jose, there's a project to create
a computer capable of understanding human expression. And SRI in
Menlo Park is hard at work on artificial intelligence.
</P>
<P>
   Still, science fiction usually is a step ahead of reality. Here
are a few of the most enticing innovations rippling through today's
sci-fi literature:
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Intelligent Agents: The glut of information on the Internet already
has spawned the development of rudimentary programs that can go out
and sift through mounds of data to find stuff that's important to
you. In the future, these programs, called intelligent agents, will
be essential sidekicks, bringing you news, prioritizing your e-mail
and doing research.
</P>
<P>
   In his book, ``Earth,'' Brin calls such agents ferrets. Tad
Williams, in ``Otherland,'' takes it a step further with an
intelligent agent that takes the form of a mechanical pet. It talks
in a human voice, plugs itself into an outlet when it gets tired
and has wireless access to just about any public network.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Artificial Intelligence: Computers that think like humans have been
a staple of science iction for years. The late Isaac Asimov
immortalized them in the form of robots. One in particular, named
Daneel (cq)  &LR; Olivaw, plays a central role in guiding humanity
through thousands of years of turmoil in the ``Foundation'' series.
</P>
<P>
   Today's chief proponent of sentient computers is Greg Bear, who
calls them thinkers. In his work, they're basically supercomputers
that have become self-aware.
</P>
<P>
   Most scientists believe that it will be decades before computers
can approach the thought processes of humans, and nobody expects
them to have an id or an ego. But a generation ago, no one would
have foreseen a computer handily beating the world chess champion,
either.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Nanotechnology: Nothing has captured the fascination of modern
sci-fi writers like nanotechnology, microscopic machines made of
biological material. In the real world, it's being developed for
medical and industrial purposes. In the not-too-distant future,
nanotech could be used to repair a blocked artery or a damaged
kidney without surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Science fiction has had a field day with nanotech. Bear writes
in ``Slant'' about material that fashions itself into complex
weapons. In William Gibson's ``Idoru,'' nanotech is used to build
buildings. And Neal Stephenson makes it the central theme of ``The
Diamond Age,'' in which entire residential areas are constructed
using it.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Bioengineering and Implants: Gibson, Bear and others write of a
time when medical science and computer science will blend,
providing fascinating new ways to enhance the human body. Implants
will let us live longer and improve the equipment that nature gave
us. Implanted microprocessors, for instance, could give us better
vision or control over our emotions, or the ability to easily
understand complex mathematics.
</P>
<P>
   Today, you can have an identity chip implanted in your cat or
dog. And no less a light than physicist Stephen Hawking predicts
that the next frontier for science will be the re-engineering of
human DNA.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
_Virtual Reality: Although it's a hot topic in the technology
press, virtual reality so far has been limited to experimental
video games and esoteric government research. It has remained for
Gibson to define the shape it eventually could take.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Neuromancer,'' the seminal work about cyberspace, he
sketched a near-future in which virtual reality is nearly
indistinguishable from reality itself. Put the electrodes on your
head or the goggles over your eyes and dive into a world of danger
and intrigue, where you can be a hero or get your brain fried.
</P>
<P>
   Stephenson, in ``Snow Crash,'' creates an entire virtual city in
cyberspace where much of the action takes place. And incredibly
sophisticated online virtual reality games are the main settings in
``Otherland,'' as well as Alexander Besher's ``Rim.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
_Superluminal Travel: At the heart of much science fiction is the
idea that outer space can be navigated like just another freeway.
Writers have cooked up any number of easily explained theories to
allow us to break the light-speed barrier.
</P>
<P>
   Captain Kirk simply says, ``Maximum warp,'' and Captain Picard
intones, ``Make it so.'' Asimov got around the problem with what he
called ``the jump,'' which let you hop through space like a kid on
a pogo stick.
</P>
<P>
   It's not so easy. Light zooms along at 186,000 miles per second,
and so far, the best our rockets can muster is less than 25,000
miles per hour. Not only that, but the laws of physics say nothing
can go faster than light. Period.
</P>
<P>
   There are, however, several theories endorsed by top physicists
that could make FTL (faster than light) travel possible. For
instance, because space curves in on itself, it may be possible to
use ``worm holes'' or other anomalies to disappear in one region of
the universe and reappear in another.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, that sounds more like science fiction than most
science fiction. But if science has taught us anything, it's that
if you can think of something, it probably can be done. Stay tuned.

   TOKYO _ It's 5:45 a.m., a few degrees above freezing, and I am
standing in a dim shed on the edge of a murky quayside where a
unique scene is being enacted.
</P>
<P>
   Below the strip lights, groups of middle-aged men in overalls
and rubber boots are prodding and pinching at hundreds of
silvery-white objects lined up in rows across the concrete.
</P>
<P>
   They look like frosty torpedoes or mysterious pods from outer
space. A thin steamy vapor rises from them, and there are yellow
labels stapled to their fins.
</P>
<P>
   At six o'clock exactly a bell is rung, and the din redoubles as
everyone in the shed starts simultaneously shouting and
gesticulating. Strings of numbers and names can be heard; a man
with a pot of red goo moves among the silvery torpedoes and brushes
an elegant Chinese character onto the outside of each.
</P>
<P>
   The bombs are the bodies of deep-frozen blue-fin tuna, the most
esteemed of all Japan's many fish, and this is the daily auction
Tsukiji fish market, the place where sushi comes to die.
</P>
<P>
   There is nowhere else quite like this in the world: in a good
year 850,000 ton of fish _ much of it still wriggling and thrashing
_ is hauled up on to this quayside on this eastern edge of Tokyo
and laid out for auction in the shed alongside it.
</P>
<P>
   Like a medieval market, an entire community of suppliers and
provisioners has grown up around the market, selling knives, hooks,
boots, weighing scales, gloves and the tons of ground ice which the
market goes through every day.
</P>
<P>
   It is a spectacle of noise and color, as aproned men drag carts
bearing buckets of the delicious, the repulsive and the weird.
</P>
<P>
   But beneath the surface much has changed in Japan during the
last year and Tsukiji, like the rest of the country, is in a state
of anxiety.
</P>
<P>
   In any recession, food is the last thing which people stop
buying and, as the world's greatest piscivores, there is no danger
that Japanese are going to stop eating fish.
</P>
<P>
   By the standards of recent European slumps, or by the economic
crisis devastating South-East Asia, the hardship here is difficult
to pin down _ for although the economic figures show an economy
unquestionably in decline, Tokyo still looks and feels like one of
the most prosperous cities on earth.
</P>
<P>
   The point is that Japan's fall has been from heights so lofty
that they appear, looking back, like a dream. At the height of the
famous Bubble Economy, Japanese were spending at such a level that
ideas of what was normal and sustainable were lost.
</P>
<P>
   The tuna sellers of Tsukiji were the beneficiaries, and then the
victims, of this bizarre period.
</P>
<P>
   Of all the elements of the auction, the most important part is
that which precedes the opening of the bids _ the poking and
caressing of the fish by the tuna buyers.
</P>
<P>
   ``You see, tuna are all different like people,'' says Osamu
Takahashi, who has been doing the job for 16 years. ``And it all
comes down to the amount of fat.''
</P>
<P>
   The lean, red tuna sells in the auction for as little as 1000
yen a kilo _ even after the numerous middlemen and transporters
have added their markup, this translates into something which the
average family can afford to eat at home.
</P>
<P>
   But it is the pale, pink toro _ with its layers of sweet marbled
fat _ which Takahashi tries to identify and which, even to the
wholesalers, costs 10,000 yen a kilo or more.
</P>
<P>
   Fatty bluefin tuna _ served as sushi, rolled with rice and
seaweed and even with gold leaf _ was the food of the bubble,
consumed by executives on expense accounts and at top-class
restaurants called ryotei, where the bill for an evening of food
and sake, served by hostesses, routinely ran in the stratospheric
range.
</P>
<P>
   But in the recessions, expense-account toro at the ryotei were
the first luxuries to go. ``Our volume of sales is about the same,
and the prices are about the same, but sometimes half the fish are
unsold,'' says one Tsukiji stallholder.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the politicians who used to go to the ryotei. They just
aren't spending anymore.'' &QL;

EDITORIAL: A RESOLUTION FOR THE MAYOR 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Monday, Jan. 4:
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's war with the New York City Council on
homeless shelters has led the administration to serve an eviction
notice on a Brooklyn community psychiatric center that serves 500
mentally ill outpatients. That was a peculiar way to celebrate the
holiday season. It is also dreadful policy making that should be
allowed to die with the old year.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani has been angry about a bill regulating homeless
shelters sponsored by Councilman Stephen DiBrienza. When the
council overrode the mayor's veto and passed the bill into law last
month, Giuliani announced that the city would have to open new
shelters as a result, particularly in DiBrienza's district.
</P>
<P>
   The administration soon centered on a building in Cobble Hill
that houses a number of community services, including a
well-established psychiatric center. The building already had the
zoning necessary for a homeless shelter, but the fact that it was
in DiBrienza's home turf was obviously the main attraction.
</P>
<P>
   This stacks up as revenge politics, no matter how the mayor's
aides spin it. The Giuliani administration originally said the new
shelter would be needed because of restrictions contained in the
DiBrienza bill. It now says the facility is required simply because
some of the older shelters in Manhattan and Queens are too large
and need to be replaced. That sort of switched signals is a good
sign that the mayor's real agenda is personal rather than
programmatic.
</P>
<P>
   The administration appeared to have changed its mind last week,
when several state and city officials said the eviction papers had
been served by mistake. But Joseph Lhota, the deputy mayor for
operations, later insisted that the eviction, which is effective
late this month, would stand.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor and his aides should celebrate the new year by ceasing
and desisting in this destructive battle. There is no emergency
that justifies displacing hundreds of mentally ill outpatients from
a location they have used for 20 years, and which the community
supports. Sites for new homeless shelters should be selected by
normal procedures, which do not include telling the community that
they are getting the facility as a punishment for their council
member's voting record.
</P>
<P>
   The administration's position on what it dislikes most about
DiBrienza's bill has changed at least twice since the measure was
passed. The new law includes significant new reporting requirements
for the Department of Homeless Services, demands the mayor has
castigated as ``micromanagement.'' It is true that among the needs
of the city's homeless population, more paperwork ranks near the
bottom. But Giuliani brought this on himself by encouraging his
agency heads to stonewall the council's requests for information.
</P>
<P>
   At his year-end press conference, the mayor said his New Year's
resolution would be to give more credit to other people in his
administration. A better goal would be to develop greater tolerance
for dissent and to curb the bellicosity that threatens to
overshadow all the accomplishments of this administration.

(ATTN: N.Y.)  
 NATALE LAURENDI, 75, LAWYER AND LIE-DETECTION EXPERT 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By WOLFGANG SAXON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Natale Laurendi, a New York criminal investigator
whose expertise with lie detectors helped convict the guilty and
clear the innocent for many years, died on Dec. 21 at his home in
Brooklyn. He was 75.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was leukemia, his family said.
</P>
<P>
   Laurendi joined the New York City Police Department in 1951 and
was assigned to the Manhattan district attorney's squad, which put
him to work on major rackets cases. At the behest of Robert F.
Kennedy, then the chief counsel of a Senate investigating committee
on organized crime, he testified at the panel's hearings on
racketeering in the Teamsters union.
</P>
<P>
   In 1962, Frank S. Hogan, the renowned Manhattan district
attorney, selected Laurendi to study polygraphy, and turned him
into the police department's star lie detector. He retired from the
force in 1975 and started Nat Laurendi, Certified Lie Detection
Inc., a private investigation and polygraphy firm in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Polygraph tests are designed to determine whether a person is
telling the truth by measuring the subject's physical reactions to
questions and recording them on a graph. Laurendi championed the
procedure as ``an excellent investigative tool for the defense, the
prosecution and the courts.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the most celebrated cases in which his work played a
vital role was the Janice Wylie and Emily Hoffert ``career girl''
murder case of 1963. Painstaking detective work, including
Laurendi's tests, helped to free a wrongly convicted defendant and
convict the real killer.
</P>
<P>
   He also figured in Patricia Hearst's 1976 bank robbery trial in
San Francisco. He served as a consultant, testified at hearings,
lectured, contributed articles and recently finished a book
manuscript.
</P>
<P>
   Laurendi was born in southern Italy but grew up in Brooklyn. In
World War II, he served as a special agent, investigator and
interpreter in the Army Counterintelligence Corps in Italy, winning
the Bronze Star with four battle stars.
</P>
<P>
   He was certified as a polygraphist at the National Training
Center in 1963. In 1969, he received an associate degree in
psychology from City College.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife of 52 years, Laura Autelitano; two
sons, Domenick and Robert, of Brooklyn; three daughters, Adrienne
Renzetti, Loretta Laurendi and Diana Allocca, all of Brooklyn; two
brothers, Joseph, of Ocala, Fla., and Anthony, of Levittown; a
sister, Matilda Cherney of Staten Island, and eight grandchildren.

EDITORIAL: CLINTON'S BUDGET OPPORTUNITIES 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Monday, Jan. 4:
</P>
<P>
   A new year always presents the president with an opportunity to
outline his domestic agenda in a State of the Union message and a
budget. This year, the impeachment furor seems all-consuming, but
by most accounts President Clinton is preparing a sensible,
measured program likely to gain broad support in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   He apparently plans to stick to his cautious formula of keeping
the budget balanced, limiting new initiatives to a few critical
areas, opposing broad new tax cuts and husbanding projected budget
surpluses to shore up Social Security. Republicans are so fractured
over budget fundamentals that they will find it hard to shift these
priorities.
</P>
<P>
   The White House's centrist thinking on the budget is politically
logical at a time of turmoil in Washington. It also makes sense in
light of the overriding need for the next Congress to deal with
Social Security, which will start to run a deficit when the baby
boomers retire in the next decade or two. There is no better time
than now to fix the nation's biggest retirement program, when
prosperity has supplied the budget surpluses to help do the job. If
Clinton can use his political skills to coax a deal on Social
Security, then there ought to be a debate about how to spend
whatever surpluses are left over.
</P>
<P>
   It may seem unrealistic to expect that Clinton, hobbled and
discredited by scandal, could wield much influence in Congress for
the remainder of his term. But consider what happened last year,
when he was able to draw paradoxical strength from his impeachment
troubles and win on the budget. It helped that in the House the
GOP's moderates and its tax-cutting social conservatives squabbled
among themselves all year. But the Republicans yielded to Clinton
on many of his spending programs because they did not want a budget
fight to draw attention away from the president's scandals, and
they knew that their own insistence on more tax cuts was not
gaining much sympathy beyond their own core supporters.
</P>
<P>
   The White House is clearly gearing up for the same fight to be
replayed this year. By most accounts, Clinton intends to showcase a
small number of high-profile spending initiatives for next year,
paid for by budget cuts or unspecified closing of loopholes in the
tax laws. These will probably include programs to combat pollution,
subsidize school construction, provide long-term care for the
elderly and disabled, and offer tax breaks for child care. Clinton
announced over the weekend that he would propose that the military
receive a $4 billion increase in the next fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
   On all these budget issues, the Republican Party is more
disorganized than at any time since the 1970s. The budget fiasco of
last year, followed by the electoral debacle in November, led to
the resignation of House Speaker Newt Gingrich. After Rep. Robert
Livingston, R-La., came and went as his replacement, House
Republicans settled on an unknown and untested deputy whip as
speaker, Rep. Dennis Hastert, R-Ill. Early on, he will have to
decide whether to listen to the confrontationalist right wing or
the moderates who are ready to make a deal.
</P>
<P>
   As for the Democrats in Congress, their hard core of liberals
and labor leaders want spending increased and will likely argue
that the election results strengthened their hand. But for now the
best policy is to use the surplus for Social Security and then have
a debate over whether to use whatever is left for tax cuts, as
Republicans want, or for the spending initiatives pushed by the
Democrats. For all the uncertainty in Washington, Congress may be
so desperate to achieve something, anything, that it will choose
bipartisan cooperation on a major domestic issue for a change. It
is not as unrealistic as it sounds.

   My friend Steve Efron was waiting in line at a bar cart by the
tracks at Grand Central Terminal on his way to Hastings-on-Hudson.
A woman rushed up, cut into the line and ordered a gin and tonic.
She then turned and announced to the waiting line, ``I'm sorry but
I have to catch a train.'' Steve didn't miss a beat. ``And I just
come here to drink,'' he said, sotto voce.

   Dear Diary:

<P>
   Having lost a glove, I rushed off to Bloomingdale's to buy
another pair. I located what I wanted, decided to buy several pairs
and went to a cashier's station.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm buying so many because I always seem to be losing my
gloves,'' I said. ``Just like `The Three Little Kittens.''' I got a
blank stare. I thought perhaps I hadn't made myself clear, so I
added, ``You know, like the three little kittens who lost their
mittens.'' Another blank stare.
</P>
<P>
   By now I was beginning to feel a little unnerved. Desperate to
make a connection, I looked around and when I saw no one in the
vicinity, I began singing, ``Three little kittens they lost their
mittens and they began to cry.''
</P>
<P>
   Now the blank stare was replaced with a look of alarm and I
decided a retreat was in order. So I added that I guess they are
teaching different nursery rhymes to the newer generation. But
internally, I was doing my own crying. I understand that the Bible
and Shakespeare no longer form a common ground for universal
discourse _ but can we now no longer even count on a shared
universe of nursery rhymes?

<P>
   Every weekday morning, my three dogs and I go for an early walk
in Central Park. As I wend my way, I often pass the same man
sitting on the same isolated bench in a remote area, wearing big
earphones over his baseball cap, reading a newspaper, his dog
tucked under his feet. He always restrains his dog, making sure he
doesn't move out from under the bench.
</P>
<P>
   One day as I was getting ready to leave the park, I leashed all
my dogs because we were about to cross the park drive. At that
moment, the man and his dog walked by.
</P>
<P>
   Sloane, my large muscular Rhodesian Ridgeback, by nature very
friendly, broke loose and charged joyfully up to the man's dog to
say hello. As she barked energetically at him to come and play, the
owner started yelling at me, ``Get your dog on a leash, lady,'' as
if that would have made a difference. I responded, ``She's really
very friendly; she just wants to play.'' He responded, ``Well,
how's he supposed to know? He's a dog.''

most of them contributing something.

   As she went downstairs to await the train, the song ended and a
new one began. It seemed familiar and Ms. Karp couldn't understand
why she was humming along. Soon the light dawned. The song was a
Chinese translation of ``Old Folks at Home.'' Now she's left with
several unanswered questions _ why and when was it translated, and
did the singer know anything about the Swanee River?

HENRY GERARD SCHWARTZ, NEUROSURGEON, DIES AT 89  (DW)

<TEXT>
<P>
   Dr. Henry Gerard Schwartz, a neurosurgeon and lecturer who
trained a new generation of specialists in his field at Washington
University School of Medicine in St. Louis, died there on Dec. 24
at St. Mary's Health Center. He was 89 and lived in suburban St.
Louis.
</P>
<P>
   In recognition of his work, 60 former neurosurgery residents at
Washington University contributed $1 million in 1996 to establish a
chair in neurological surgery in his name. While chairman of the
department from 1946 to 1974, Schwartz developed a training program
that produced many academicians and practitioners who went on to
full professorships.
</P>
<P>
   Schwartz, a native of New York, entered Princeton University at
15 and graduated in 1928. He earned his medical degree at Johns
Hopkins University School of Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   He interned in surgery at Johns Hopkins and served as an
instructor in anatomy at Harvard Medical School until moving to the
St. Louis campus in 1936. One of his early contributions was a
study on the effect of lumbar puncture, in which a needle is
inserted into the spinal canal, in reducing the pressure inside the
skull in severe head injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Schwartz's wife, Dr. Edith Robinson Schwartz, a pediatrician and
pediatric psychiatrist, died four years ago. He is survived by
three sons, Henry Jr. of St. Louis, Michael of Birmingham, Mich.,
and Richard of Salt Lake City; a sister, Jean Grottano of New York;
six grandchildren, and four great-grandchildren.

NASA LAUNCHES PROBE ON 11-MONTH JOURNEY TO MARS
<TEXT>
<P>
   By MARK CARREAU &QL;
</P>
<P>
   c. 1999 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Houston Chronicle &QL;
</P>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ NASA's Mars Polar Lander rocketed from Earth on
Sunday, initiating an 11-month journey to the Red Planet where
scientists hope it will search for water _ a key ingredient for
life _ frozen amid the frigid terrain of the South Pole.
</P>
<P>
   The 1,300-pound probe blasted off from the Cape Canaveral Air
Force Station in Florida at 2:21 p.m. CST aboard a Boeing Delta II
rocket, rising through cloudy skies.
</P>
<P>
   Just over an hour after liftoff, the probe had successfully
separated from the rocket's third stage to begin its lengthy
interplanetary journey, transmitted data back to Earth through its
ground station network and deployed two power-generating solar
arrays.
</P>
<P>
   The probe's navigational system, however, took longer than
expected to find and ``lock'' onto a collection of guide stars that
were to keep the spacecraft on course. The Polar Lander is to
follow a 470-million-mile-long celestial pathway that will take it
first toward the sun, then outward into the solar system to
intercept Mars.
</P>
<P>
   John McNamee, NASA's Mars Polar Lander project manager, said the
spacecraft was pointed at the sun as intended as its journey began
but was making a slow circular motion as it searched for guide
stars. ``The spacecraft is doing exactly what it's supposed to do
at this point in time and will continue to do so until it does find
a solution,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Polar Lander was developed by NASA's Jet Propulsion
Laboratory of Pasadena, Calif., to search for evidence of ice
embedded below the surface after making a soft landing in the
desert-like Martian polar terrain. The lander and a pair of tiny
companion probes called Deep Space 2 were designed to work in
concert with NASA's Mars Climate Orbiter, which was launched by a
Delta rocket on a nine-month trajectory to the Red Planet on Dec.
11.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers believe the latest collection of small spacecraft
headed for Mars can determine whether the Red Planet still harbors
any of the water that pictures gathered by earlier probes suggest
once flowed in abundance over the now cold, arid landscape. With
conditions more like the Earth's, Mars could have been hospitable
for life, some scientists reason.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to follow the water if you're looking for life,''
Ed Weiler, NASA's chief of space sciences, told reporters before
Polar Lander lifted off. ``We have a lot of reasons to believe
there is water on Mars in the form of ice. But until you actually
land there and find it, you can't say for sure.''
</P>
<P>
   The space agency has invested nearly $360 million in the Polar
Lander and Climate Orbiter missions in a bid to gather
confirmation.
</P>
<P>
   The Polar Lander probe is scheduled to reach the Martian surface
on Dec. 3, using techniques pioneered by NASA's much-larger Viking
probes of the late 1970s to touch down.
</P>
<P>
   The lander was engineered to make a direct, high velocity
descent into the Martian atmosphere. It will be slowed first by the
friction of the planet's thin atmosphere, then by parachutes. A
dozen small braking rockets should bring the less than 4-foot-tall
lander to a gentle, upright stop on the surface.
</P>
<P>
   Using electrical power generated by new solar arrays unfurled on
the Martian terrain, the robotic spacecraft will direct a more than
6-foot-long mechanical arm into the surrounding soil to scoop up a
sample.
</P>
<P>
   The soil will be deposited into an oven-analyzer on the lander,
where it will be heated and surveyed for the presence of water
vapor. The lander is also equipped with cameras, temperature and
pressure probes as well as a cloud monitor that should operate for
about three months.
</P>
<P>
   Before it plunges toward the south pole of Mars, the spacecraft
will also release a pair of small basketball-sized probes dubbed
Deep Space 2. They are designed to smack into the surface at
velocities of nearly 500 miles per hour.
</P>
<P>
   The tremendous force of the impact will drive small
bullet-shaped probes about three feet into the ground. Drills will
gather small subsurface soil samples, which will also be heated and
analyzed for water vapor.
</P>
<P>
   The Climate Orbiter is designed to reach Mars in September. It
will orbit Mars rather than land, functioning much as a weather
satellite.
</P>
<P>
   The Climate Orbiter is equipped to track the movement of water
vapor and dust through the atmosphere between the equator and polar
regions over the course of a Martian year. Scientists theorize that
as the seasons on Mars change dust and water from the equatorial
regions of the planet are deposited at the poles.
</P>
<P>
   The Climate Orbiter will double as a communications satellite,
relaying signals from the Polar Lander and Deep Space 2 probes to
Earth.
</P>
<P>
   Polar Lander is also equipped with a small, privately-funded
microphone that designers hope will record and relay to Earth the
first sounds heard on Mars.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't know what we will hear,'' said Weiler. ``I don't
think we will hear Elvis. At least, I hope not.''

CHINESE DISSIDENT ON A HUNGER STRIKE LEAVES HOSPITAL 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JULIAN E. BARNES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A Chinese dissident on a weeklong hunger strike to
protest China's crackdown on a fledgling democratic party was
released from Bellevue Hospital Center Sunday after being taken
there Saturday, a hospital spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   The dissident, Wang Xizhe, one of China's first pro-democracy
activists, began his hunger strike during a protest on Dec. 27 in
front of the U.N. headquarters, said Wang Bingzhang, an organizer
of the protest. Wang Xizhe returned to his home in Elmhurst,
Queens, Sunday, but has still refused food and hopes to continue
his hunger strike for at least two more days, Wang Bingzhang said.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, the Chinese government sentenced three men in China
to prison terms of more than a decade each after they tried to
organize the Chinese Democracy Party as a formal opposition to the
Chinese Communist Party. Wang Xizhe, chief secretary of the
overseas committee of the Democracy Party, was joined by about 15
others who staged shorter hunger strikes last week, said Wang
Bingzhang, who is also an adviser to the Democracy Party.
</P>
<P>
   ``We organized this hunger strike to protest the arrests by the
Chinese government and to urge the United Nations and international
society to do something to stop these persecutions,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Pro-democracy activists had hoped that the Chinese government
would relax political controls after President Clinton's trip to
China in June, and leaders began applying to register their party
with the government. But those expectations were quickly abandoned
after the first arrests and a speech last month by President Jiang
Zemin, who said that challenges to one-party rule in China would be
``annihilated.''
</P>
<P>
   Party members who remained free after the crackdown have phoned,
written and sent e-mails to support Wang Xizhe and to ask about the
hunger strike, said Wang Bingzhang, who is no relation.
</P>
<P>
   Wang Xizhe, 50, was one of the first Chinese critics of
totalitarian rule in China to become known to the West, said Andrew
Nathan, a political science professor at Columbia University.
</P>
<P>
   Wang Bingzhang said he and Wang Xizhe are scheduled to testify
about the arrests later this week before the House of
Representatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``We advised him to eat,'' Wang Bingzhang said. ``He has to
recover his health to go to Washington.''

PARTISAN TONE EXPECTED AS LEGISLATORS RETURN TO ALBANY 
 (DW)
</HEADLINE>
  By RAYMOND HERNANDEZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ With the capital's political landscape left
virtually untouched by the November elections, lawmakers return
here this week for a 1999 legislative session that experts say is
likely to yield the same sort of partisanship and acrimony that
have become synonymous with Albany.
</P>
<P>
   Both Gov. George E. Pataki, a Republican, and his Democratic
rivals in the Legislature enter the new year with their hands
strengthened by voters. Pataki won a second term by handily
defeating all three of his major opponents, while Democrats
increased their large majority in the Assembly by one seat.
</P>
<P>
   The election results seem to have emboldened these bitter
adversaries as they prepare to confront a host of important policy
issues from proposed utility rate cuts to criminal justice
initiatives.
</P>
<P>
   The governor and legislative leaders must also grapple with the
main business of Albany, adopting a state budget. The Legislature
has failed for the last six years to enact a budget by the April 1
deadline, becoming mired instead in long and bitter legislative
sessions that have regularly plunged the state into fiscal
uncertainty.
</P>
<P>
   The budget is expected to be among the most contentious issues
again this year, largely because the state has a ballooning budget
surplus that Democrats and Republicans are already deeply divided
over how to spend. Experts contend that the surplus could total as
much as $2 billion by March 31, when the state's 1998-99 fiscal
year ends.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers note that at least they will not face the same kinds
of highly partisan issues that divided them in previous years, like
revamping the state's welfare and rent-regulation laws. Zenia
Mucha, the governor's spokeswoman, said, ``If partisan politics do
not become the focal point, I think we can have a relatively
productive session.''
</P>
<P>
   But the work awaiting the Legislature in 1999 would be difficult
to resolve even in the most collegial environment. Democrats in the
Assembly say they intend to push a plan to cut electricity rates by
reducing the Pataki administration's role in reorganizing New
York's electric power industry. Pataki has resisted that proposal
in the past, though he also strongly advocates cutting electric
rates.
</P>
<P>
   Some Democrats are also seeking to ease what they and others
assert are the state's Draconian drug penalties, though Republicans
have made no effort to change them even as they acknowledge that
the penalties should be more flexible.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki and his Republican allies who control the State Senate
say they will renew their call for a sweeping overhaul of the
state's juvenile justice system, seeking harsher sanctions and the
flexibility to prosecute youths as adults for certain violent
crimes. Democrats have expressed a willingness to compromise on
this issue in the past but have failed to pass a bill that
Republicans would support. Pataki and Senate Republicans also want
to pass a package of bills that would stiffen penalties for sex
offenses and crimes committed in schools.
</P>
<P>
   A looming complication for 1999 could be Pataki's apparent
ambition for national office. After proposing an election-year
budget last year that was criticized by fiscal conservatives
nationwide, the governor plans to offer the kind of austere budget
that he championed in his first two years in office. His aides say
he mainly wants to hedge against a downturn in the economy.
</P>
<P>
   Such a move could also help enhance his standing among
conservatives who dominate the national Republican Party, even as
it potentially angers Assembly Democrats who battled against deep
spending cuts that he proposed in 1995, his first year in office.
</P>
<P>
   Anger between Pataki and the Legislature would be nothing new.
They clashed fiercely over a surplus last year after Pataki vetoed
hundreds of millions of dollars in programs approved by both houses
of the Legislature. The items vetoed were largely Democratic
initiatives, like a plan that would have spent $500 million to
refurbish existing schools and build new ones.
</P>
<P>
   The hostility stirred by that action has yet to subside as
Pataki's main nemesis in the budget debate, Assembly Speaker
Sheldon Silver, indicated in a recent interview. ``I don't think
the public will let the Governor get away with his partisan
vetoes,'' Silver, a Manhattan Democrat, said. He added that
Pataki's ``right wing'' agenda was ``out of step with New
Yorkers.''

LADY VOLS SOLVE THE ZONE BEFORE RECORD GARDEN CROWD
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By CHRIS BROUSSARD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It would have been an outstanding accomplishment, one
that might have given Rutgers its biggest victory of the season and
sent tremors through women's college basketball. It would have made
the Scarlet Knights defensive legends and had every team from Rhode
Island to California studying videotape of their game against
Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   But late in the first half of Sunday's historic contest at
Madison Square Garden, Semeka Randall declared that one of
Tennessee's three preseason all-Americans would solve Rutgers' zone
defense.
</P>
<P>
   Picking up the slack for her sluggish star teammates, Chamique
Holdsclaw and Tamika Catchings, Randall scored 8 points in less
than four minutes to lift the Lady Vols from a deficit to a
halftime lead that they would never surrender. Then, as Holdsclaw
and Catchings continued to struggle after intermission, the least
celebrated of the ``Three Meeks'' pierced the hearts of the Scarlet
Knights with hustle and midrange jump shots to score a game-high 18
points and lead second-ranked Tennessee (11-1) to a 68-54 victory.
</P>
<P>
   While Rutgers did an excellent job of controlling Holdsclaw and
Catchings, it was too much to ask of the Scarlet Knights to stop
all three of Coach Pat Summitt's headliners.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're all great players,'' said Rutgers Coach Vivian
Stringer, who employed the hectic matchup zone made famous by
Temple Coach John Chaney. ``The zone did what we needed it to do,
but it doesn't cover everything.''
</P>
<P>
   To the chagrin of the record crowd, the zone did slow down
Holdsclaw, the native of Astoria, Queens, who was making only her
second collegiate appearance in New York. To allow the three-time
all-American to play before a hometown audience, Summitt and
Stringer had worked together to bring women's college basketball
back to Madison Square Garden for the first time since December
1981.
</P>
<P>
   And with the game billed as ``Holdsclaw's Homecoming,'' 15,735
fans, the largest crowd to watch a women's college game at the
Garden, showed up to cheer on both Holdsclaw and No. 15 Rutgers
(10-3).
</P>
<P>
   But the 6-foot-2-inch do-everything senior had her worst game of
the season, failing to score in double figures for the first time
this season and for only the seventh time in her distinguished
career. Missing 7 of 9 field-goal attempts, Holdsclaw scored 8
points, only 3 above her career low.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, you're going to be disappointed when you come home,
but I know what I can do,'' said Holdsclaw, who entered the game
averaging 21 points. ``I don't think I was nervous. I just never
really got into the flow of the game. But I know this won't happen
again because I want to be the best, and in order to be the best, I
have to wake up and respond.''
</P>
<P>
   Stringer knows Holdsclaw will not have many games like Sunday's.
``She is the finest basketball player in America,'' Stringer said.
``Period. The End. She is all of that.''
</P>
<P>
   Catchings, the daughter of the former National Basketball
Association player Harvey Catchings, is not far behind Holdsclaw.
In fact, the 6-1 sophomore broke most of Holdsclaw's freshman
records in earning all-American status last year. But against the
Scarlet Knights' energetic defense, she managed only 11 points, 5
below her season average, on 2-of-11 shooting.
</P>
<P>
   Randall, a 5-10 sophomore who averages 12 points, was not the
only Lady Vol to fill the gap. Center Michelle Snow, a 6-5
freshman, started in place of the injured Teresa Geter and
displayed a soft shooting touch in recording 16 points and 9
rebounds. And the senior point guard Kellie Jolly (10 points) hit
four jump shots of 15 feet or more.
</P>
<P>
   While Stringer played down talk of a moral victory, she had to
take some consolation in the improvement her team showed against
Tennessee. In last year's National Collegiate Athletic Association
tournament, the Lady Vols bounced Rutgers from the final 16 in a
92-60 rout.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's game was actually closer than the final score
indicated. Though Rutgers trailed by 16 points, it was never a
rout. And the Scarlet Knights were quite impressive early in the
game.
</P>
<P>
   Limiting the taller Vols to one shot offensively and feeding the
sophomore center Tammy Sutton-Brown for 9 of her team-high 12
points, Rutgers grabbed leads of 17-13 and 22-19. But Snow buried a
16-footer, Catchings followed with a short jumper and Randall awoke
to score 8 of her 9 first-half points as Tennessee ended the half
with a 15-6 run.
</P>
<P>
   Her club ahead by 34-28 at the start of the second half, the
athletic Randall made two long jump shots, a layup and two free
throws to help push the lead to 51-36 midway through the half.
Rutgers pulled no closer than 9 points the rest of the way, as
seven missed layups and a couple of unforced errors kept it from
challenging.
</P>
<P>
   With two of Tennessee's three stars playing poorly, Stringer
knew her club missed an opportunity. ``We got layups, we got
bunnies,'' she said. ``If we hit them, it would have been a totally
different story.'' &QL;

BCS IS ALREADY A WINNER BEFORE THE NATIONAL TITLE GAME
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By JOE DRAPE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, Ariz. _ In the summer, the Bowl Championship Series
organizers took their charts around the country and explained how
the voting polls and computer rankings would conspire to make the
Fiesta Bowl a true national championship game. When Tennessee and
Florida State take the field here Monday night, the public opinion
campaigns will be over and all that interfacing will have indeed
produced an undisputed title game.
</P>
<P>
   The only numbers that will matter are the old-fashioned kind.
</P>
<P>
   The Seminoles (11-1) will line up the nation's No. 1 defense.
The Volunteers (12-0) will try to bludgeon that unit with the
nation's 17th-ranked rushing offense. Florida State will try to get
the ball to a flashy wide receiver, all-American Peter Warrick, who
averages 20.2 yards a reception and 102 yards a game. Tennessee
will try to sling it to the aptly named Peerless Price, who
averaged 15.1 yards a catch and found the end zone 10 times.
</P>
<P>
   On one sideline will be Tennessee coach Phillip Fulmer, whose
.857 winning percentage is the best among active coaches. He is 48
years old, a meticulous, low-key man _ one best summed up by Price
as ``the only coach I've ever seen tuck in his sweat suit'' _
trying to capture his first championship and cap a dream season
that has already earned him national coach of the year honors and a
new contract worth $1 million annually.
</P>
<P>
   On the other sideline is Florida State's Bobby Bowden, who, at
69, has won 12 of his last 13 bowl games, won more games than any
other coach in the 1990s, including a national title in '93, and is
revered for offering dadgummits and laughs in numbers that dwarf
his high-scoring offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never accomplished so much sitting on the couch,'' he
quipped of the final day of the season, when his team leaped from
No. 4 to the Fiesta Bowl when previously unbeaten Kansas State and
UCLA were upset.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing over the past six days of the bowl season occurred to
diminish Monday night's Fiesta Bowl as The Game and the BCS as a
viable measuring stick, despite what Ohio State coach John Cooper
and the Buckeye faithful want you to believe.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, the Big Ten went 5-0 in the bowl season, but Ohio State's
24-14 victory over Texas A&AMP;M in the Sugar Bowl does not seem to be
convincing enough to earn the No. 1 ranking in the Associated Press
news media poll even if Florida State wins an ugly game over
undefeated Tennessee. The coaches' poll has declared that its No. 1
will go to the Fiesta winner.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the BCS ranking looks prescient when you consider what
happened to three teams that were in the race for the title game
until the final week.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas State appeared to be rightfully locked out of the big
games when that untested bunch rolled over against unranked Purdue,
37-34, in the Alamo Bowl to finish with consecutive defeats. UCLA
also found back-to-back heartbreak at the hands of its lax defense,
beaten by Wisconsin, 38-31, in the Rose Bowl. And Florida, one of
eight bowl teams Florida State beat this season, flattered both
teams by pasting Syracuse, 31-10, in the Orange Bowl. The Gators'
only losses in a 10-2 season were to the Seminoles and Volunteers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it worked for what it was set up to do,'' Bowden
said of the BCS as he entered the Fiesta Bowl with a team that had
won 10 consecutive games after a September loss to North Carolina
State. ``Despite all the criticism, they did a great job of putting
that thing together.''
</P>
<P>
   Referring to Cooper, whose Ohio State team finished 11-1, Bowden
added: ``Don't blame John for feeling the way he does _ he might
have the best football team in the nation. But if Tennessee wins,
they'll be national champions, and if we win, then we'll be. That's
the way they've drawn it up this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Fullmer: ``All I want to be able to do is say that we won
Monday night. As I've said a number of times, the BCS system worked
itself out just as good as it could be. I don't think anyone's
questioned our invitation.''
</P>
<P>
   At quarterback, Tennessee junior Tee Martin did what Peyton
Manning could not, drive the Volunteers to the championship game,
by winning four games in the fourth quarter. Manning's passing
records are safe, but Martin has gotten better. In his last seven
games, he has thrown for 214 yards an outing, 10 touchdowns and
only two interceptions, and has raised the Vols' average offensive
total 64 yards to 423.7 a game.
</P>
<P>
   The quarterback for the Seminoles, the sophomore Marcus Outzen _
dubbed the Rooster by his teammates for his red crewcut _ will be
making only his third college start. Outzen, whom Bowden recruited
as a backup, inherited the starting job when Chris Weinke injured
his neck in the 10th game of the season. Bowden compliments
Outzen's toughness, ``his swagger,'' but says his passes flutter
and wobble.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got a guy making his third start _ they got one making
his 13th,'' Bowden said of Martin and what he considers an
advantage for the Vols.
</P>
<P>
   But both coaches say the game could come down to the
place-kickers. Florida State will rely on the Lou Groza Award
winner as the nation's best kicking specialist, Sebastian
Janikowski, a former member of the Poland's under-17 national
soccer team. He has made 27 of 32 career field-goal attempts, 42 of
43 extra-point attempts and, at a mammoth 6 feet 2 inches and 255
pounds, booms the ball on kickoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``His kick sounds like a howitzer,'' Tennessee kicker Jeff Hall
said. ``I may just pull a lawn chair up on the 50 and watch him
warm up.''
</P>
<P>
   Hall is the Southeastern Conference's career scoring leader with
371 points and connected on 19 of 24 field-goal attempts this
season, including game-winners against Syracuse and Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Just as Hall is close to his coach _ he and Fulmer both are from
Winchester, Tenn. _ Janikowski enjoys a certain kinship with
Bowden. Both are candid. Both are funny.
</P>
<P>
   When asked if he wanted to kick the game-winner, Janikowski
nodded an arduous no.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd rather we score a touchdown,'' said the player known as
the Polish Powder Keg. ``I know a lot of kickers don't say that.
But we all think it.''
</P>
<P>
   So the national title will be decided on the field Monday night.
John Cooper and poll voters won't be able to upstage the Rooster
and the Polish Powder Keg. The BCS worked.

ONE GOAL GRETZKY DOES NOT HAVE IS A FAREWELL TOUR
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By JOE LAPOINTE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ His best moments are still as great as ever, even in
his 20th season, even in the month of his 38th birthday. When Wayne
Gretzky of the Rangers controls the puck behind the net on the
power play, he seems like a master puppeteer, feinting and faking
and making two teams jump and dance like sets of marionettes. These
moments, when the Rangers have the manpower advantage and the
checking is light and the offense is in place, bring out Gretzky's
best talents: his ability to create, to anticipate and to pass to
the open man. These moments bring cheers and murmurs of
appreciation even on the road. These moments produce points, most
of them assists, which keep Gretzky among the top 20 scorers in the
National Hockey League.
</P>
<P>
   Other moments are not as pleasant. When teams are at even
strength, when the tempo is high, when defenders are aggressively
checking him or taking away his passing options, Gretzky sometimes
gets frustrated. You can see it in the way he swings his stick at
the ice shavings and lifts one skate over the other as he shakes
his head on his way to the bench after a long shift. Even on the
road, fans wince when he gets up slowly from a hard hit, with a
grimace on his angular face, because he does not avoid collisions
as well as he once did. On these nights, when he and his
ever-changing cast of linemates get penned up in their defensive
end or trapped up ice, Gretzky might record no goals or assists or
even shots. In these games, he might lead his team only in
turnovers or in complaints to the referee.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always worn my heart on my sleeve,'' Gretzky said. ``I
still hate to lose. Obviously, I know the spotlight is on me more
than anyone else.'' &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  Obviously, when people ask him how much longer he will play,
Gretzky knows the unspoken implications. ``I'm smart enough now to
realize I'm at a point in my career where it's year to year,'' he
said. ``But I don't sit in the locker room and say: `Oh, I'm done.
This is my last year.' On the other side, I don't sit here and say,
`I'm going to play another two or three years.'''
</P>
<P>
   This is his third season with the Rangers, the fourth team of
his NHL career. The only standard of comparison for Gretzky is
himself _ 5, 10, 15 or 20 years ago. Heading into Monday night's
game with the San Jose Sharks at Madison Square Garden, Gretzky
leads the Rangers in points with 37, on 6 goals and 31 assists. For
his career, he holds the NHL record for goals (891), assists
(1,941) and points (2,832). In the history of the sport, the only
players who rank with his legend are Gordie Howe and Bobby Orr.
Howe may have played too long, retiring at age 52 in 1980. And Orr
didn't play long enough, retiring prematurely at age 30 in 1978
because of a knee injury.
</P>
<P>
   What about Gretzky? He has one season left on his contract. It
is an option year in which his salary would drop from $6 million to
$5 million. The option is the Rangers'. Neil Smith, the general
manager, and Mike Barnett, Gretzky's agent, both say they have not
discussed Gretzky's future. Smith said, ``If he keeps going the way
he is going, barring any unforeseen circumstances, we would want to
renew it.'' Smith has said in the past that Gretzky and the Rangers
will mutually agree on the appropriate time for his retirement.
Gretzky has often said that the Rangers will be his last team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like any other player, he's had nights when I don't think he's
been happy with his play,'' Smith said. ``I think, generally, his
play has been very good.''
</P>
<P>
   Gretzky's statistics would seem to suggest that. But his unique
style of give-and-go passes and reverses against the flow is not an
easy fit on this roster. His linemates this season have included
Esa Tikkanen, Aleksei Kovalev, John MacLean, Kevin Stevens, Petr
Nedved, Mike Knuble, Niklas Sundstrom, Todd Harvey and Adam Graves.
Smith has been under pressure to trade for a sharpshooter who can
complete the scoring chances that Gretzky creates. But they have
players who can score goals; Graves has 16 and MacLean has 12. Is
everyone out of step but Gretzky, or is it difficult, as Luc
Robitaille once said, for players to blend their skills with his?
</P>
<P>
   ``When he went to St. Louis, people said, `Brett Hull and Wayne
Gretzky together will be unbelievable,''' Smith said. ``And it
didn't work. And I don't know why it didn't work.'' Now, Smith
feels pressure to obtain Pavel Bure, the Vancouver superstar, who
has demanded a trade. Bure, some say, would be as good on Gretzky's
wing as Jari Kurri was back when they played with Mark Messier for
the Edmonton Oilers' championship dynasty of the 1980's.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where do we find that Jari Kurri-type guy?'' Smith said. ``It
might not be the obvious, Pavel Bure.''
</P>
<P>
   Two of Gretzky's most difficult nights this season have been in
losses in Buffalo. After the first one, a member of the Sabres'
checking line, Vaclav Varada, said it was easy to stop Gretzky
because he just skated around the neutral zone. This angered
several Rangers, who collided hard with Varada in their next
meeting. At the end of the second game, when Varada scored an
empty-net goal, Harvey chased Varada and punched him in the back of
the head, earning a one-game suspension. Given a chance to amend
his remarks about Gretzky, Varada repeated them. ``It's the
truth,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   When asked about Varada's comments, Gretzky said that ``everyone
is entitled to their own opinion.'' Gretzky said such words would
have hurt more coming from Sabres stars like Mike Peca or Dominik
Hasek. As for Varada, Gretzky said, ``Probably the only thing him
and I have in common is we'll both be playing golf in about three
years.
</P>
<P>
   His teammates are protective of Gretzky, even when acknowledging
his limitations. Mike Richter, the Ranger goalie, said Varada's
observations offended the Rangers because they were ``inaccurate
and not an easy thing to hear.'' As for Gretzky's occasional
frustration over his level of play, Richter said it might be a
natural thing that happens to veterans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maturing throughout your career is insidious,'' Richter said.
``Quietly, it starts to put limitations on what you are able to do.
Wayne sees the game probably better now than ever. But it's a
cruelty of sports that when you are mentally at your peak, you
start to deteriorate physically. He has so much willpower that he
overcomes whatever level of deterioration his body has had. And so
he masks it very well. He knows what he needs to do. He can still
be an incredibly effective player.''
</P>
<P>
   The New York phase of Gretzky's career has seen limited success
for the team. In his first season, the Rangers surprised the league
by reaching the third round of the playoffs. In his second,
1997-98, they failed to qualify.
</P>
<P>
   Gretzky raves about the quality of Manhattan life for his wife,
Janet, and their three children. The two boys play in a youth
hockey league at Chelsea Piers. They wear their first names on
their jerseys, not their last, because ``Gretzky'' would bring
added pressure. Their numbers are 14 and 5, not the 99 that Dad
made famous.
</P>
<P>
   ``I fit in with the other parents,'' Gretzky said. ``I bring
doughnuts, sit there and drink coffee. I don't tell the coach, `We
should do this.'''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Nor does he advise the Ranger coach, John Muckler, or Smith. In
Los Angeles, from 1988 to 1996, it was often suggested that Gretzky
decided which teammates, or even coaches, would come and go. ``I
was starting to get accused of things that were not true,'' Gretzky
said. Smith said he assumed from afar that this was happening in
Los Angeles, but that Gretzky has no input regarding the Ranger
roster. But it is also true that Muckler was hired in part because
he coached Gretzky in Edmonton.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I said that I didn't take Wayne into consideration when I
hired John, I'd be lying,'' Smith said. ``I definitely did. I was
thinking about Wayne.'' Muckler's assistants, Craig MacTavish and
Charlie Huddy, were friends of Gretzky's when they all played for
the Oilers.
</P>
<P>
   Barnett, the agent, said Gretzky calls him every day, usually
after games, to talk about how he has played. Smith said Gretzky is
a ``hockey yenta'' who likes to keep informed of rumors and
scuttlebutt through his extensive grapevine, but that Gretzky
``avoids confrontation'' whenever possible. Gretzky denies holding
any bitterness toward Messier, who left the Rangers as a free agent
after they reunited here for only one season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came here and moved my family here to play with Mark and
play with the Rangers,'' Gretzky said. ``I understand this business
probably better than any other athlete in this room. I was traded
in '88, from Edmonton to Los Angeles, after winning four cups and I
don't know how many MVPs. I wish Mark nothing but good wishes.
Obviously, I wish he'd stayed here.''
</P>
<P>
   They come around, they go around, and Gretzky is a believer in
karma. ``If you are a good person, and you are good to people, good
things will happen,'' Gretzky said. ``If you treat people poorly
and you are not a good person, eventually it will bite you in the
rear end.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps this explains the generosity of Gretzky, who is aware of
many special moments as his era nears an end. When the Rangers
played their final game in Maple Leaf Gardens in Toronto last
month, Gretzky autographed several sticks he used and gave them to
special people. One was to Smith.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mine says, `To Neil, with thanks, Wayne Gretzky,''' Smith
said. ``And he put the date on it and I'll keep it forever. He knew
it was a historic event. He was humble about it, but yet, at the
same time, he knew its significance. It's an interesting
combination. Most people are either egotistical or so humble they
wouldn't dare do that. But Wayne is very unique.'' Gretzky has
saved every puck from every goal he has scored as a Ranger,
although he admits he does not yet know what he will do with them.
</P>
<P>
   There are many people who want Gretzky to announce his
retirement at the beginning of his final season, so that he can
have a farewell tour the way Kareem Abdul-Jabbar did when he left
the National Basketball Association. There would be pre-game
ceremonies, presentation of gifts, long standing ovations for the
man who defined his era and is still the only hockey player some
Americans have ever heard of. Such a tour, Gretzky said, is out of
the question.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it would be fair to these guys to have a
farewell tour,'' he said. ``Every game would be set back and the
focus would not be on what is most important: the game. The fans
have been great to me. I like to think I've worked hard and did the
best I could to help sell our sport. The game owes Wayne Gretzky
nothing. The fans owe Wayne Gretzky nothing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't mean that to sound ignorant or not appreciative.
Everything I have I owe to the NHL. When it's done, it's done.''  &QL;

<P>
   JACKSONVILLE, Fla. _ In the war of attrition that is the NFL
season, the postseason is sometimes left with the tattered remnants
of what had been good football teams.
</P>
<P>
   So it was at Alltel Stadium on Sunday afternoon, when the
Jacksonville Jaguars, with 13 players on injured reserve and
quarterback Mark Brunell limping on a sprained ankle, beat the even
more decimated New England Patriots 25-10.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots were missing their quarterback, Drew Bledsoe; their
top receiver, Terry Glenn; and their two best linebackers, Ted
Washington and Todd Collins.
</P>
<P>
   Not that the Jaguars _ except for rookie Fred Taylor (162 yards
on 33 rushing attempts) _ were especially imposing. Brunell hadn't
played in a month, and the inactivity showed. A scrambler by
nature, he was confined mostly to the pocket, and his passes often
sailed high.
</P>
<P>
   ``My footwork wasn't where it needed to be,'' Brunell said. ``I
twisted my ankle before halftime, and I wasn't feeling that good in
the third quarter.''
</P>
<P>
   Coach Tom Coughlin considered pulling him when the Patriots made
the score 12-7 with 4:27 left in the third.
</P>
<P>
   ``I encouraged him to keep me in there,'' Brunell said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He gave me a solid argument,'' Coughlin said, ``so I let him
stay in.''
</P>
<P>
   That was a good decision, because early in the fourth quarter,
Brunell broke the game open with a 37-yard touchdown pass to Jimmy
Smith.
</P>
<P>
   As the Jaguars left the huddle, Smith intended to run an 18-yard
comeback route. But when Brunell surveyed the defensive alignment,
he saw All-Pro cornerback Ty Law just a yard in front of his
favorite receiver.
</P>
<P>
   So Brunell gave Smith a hand signal to go deep. Smith outran Law
and caught the ball diving and stretching in the end zone.
</P>
<P>
   ``We needed a boost,'' Brunell said. ``Things were going their
way, and it changed the momentum for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith caught 78 passes this season for 1,182 yards, but he
didn't expect many opportunities working against Law.
</P>
<P>
   ``He shut down Keyshawn Johnson (of the New York Jets) and all
the big-time receivers,'' Smith said. ``I caught a lot of short
routes today, which I hate doing. I like to let Keenan (McCardell)
catch those. I'm the long receiver.''
</P>
<P>
   But Sunday, the rusty Brunell was having trouble hitting long or
short. He completed only 14 of 34 passes for 161 yards. Patriots QB
Scott Zolak also was erratic, completing 21 of 44 for 190.
</P>
<P>
   The difference in this game was Taylor's running.
</P>
<P>
   ``We heard rumbles out of New England that we were a finesse
team,'' Taylor said. ``We wanted to show them who was smash-mouth
and who was soft. Early in the week, our offensive line made a
dedication to be more physical.''
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots, meanwhile, were shut down on the ground. Robert
Edwards, who gained 1,115 yards during the regular season, was held
to 28 yards on 17 carries.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seemed they knew every time we were going to run the ball
and had the right blitz called,'' Edwards said.
</P>
<P>
   Even without starting center Quentin Neujahr, the Jacksonville
line consistently opened holes for Taylor. Backup center John Wade
sealed off the middle of the Patriots' line as Taylor sprang the
longest play of the day, a 46-yard scamper in the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the biggest hole I had all season,'' Taylor said. ``I
should have scored a touchdown, but No. 21 (cornerback Steve
Israel) ran me down.''
</P>
<P>
   So the Jaguars had to settle for the second of four field goals
by Mike Hollis.
</P>
<P>
   Other than Taylor's breakaway and Smith's TD catch, there wasn't
much excitement in this game. Perhaps that's what the local
citizenry anticipated, judging from the gaps of empty blue seating
in the middle of the stands.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the game lacked, the Patriots at least made a contest
of it in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Jaguars were dropping in zone coverage a lot,'' Edwards
said, ``and it opened up a lot of underneath routes, and Zolak took
advantage of opportunities.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Zolak: ``We had guys down, and we had to rally around other
guys, including myself stepping in for Drew. We were undermanned at
times, but we overcame a lot of things.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith echoed a similar theme _ what might be possible with
better health.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we had all our guys back, we'd be tough to stop,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But the Jaguars will have to go on the road to play the Jets
next Sunday with what they have. Unless Brunell sharpens up quickly
and Taylor runs as well as he did on his home field, they may not
have enough.

FAN'S MCGWIRE BASEBALL TURNS INTO AUCTION'S HOLY GRAIL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mo., N.Y.)  (js) 
 By DOUGLAS MARTIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ On Jan. 12, a baseball that was made in Costa Rica
for considerably less than $5 will be auctioned at a price some
think will exceed $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   The ball is identical with the other 70,000 dozen supplied by
Rawlings Sporting Goods to major-league teams last season, with one
distinction. It is the ball Mark McGwire of the St. Louis Cardinals
whacked over the fence on Sept. 27. The homer was his 70th _ and
last _ of a record-smashing season.
</P>
<P>
   That blow turned the ball into something between a sacred relic
and an alarming emblem of a society veering toward absurdity. Even
if the pre-auction hoopla is exaggerated, the ball figures to dwarf
the record $126,500 paid last month for the ball Babe Ruth hit for
the first home run in Yankee Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Arguably, the home run ball is America's obsession, the
objectified reflection of the country's simplest, perhaps, best
dreams. In Don DeLillo's dark novel ``Underworld,'' the lost ball
Bobby Thomson of the New York Giants hit to seize the pennant from
the Brooklyn Dodgers in 1951 becomes a novelistic device, appearing
at significant moments in the narrative. It ends up in the hands of
the protagonist, who uses it to summon an unrecoverable past.
</P>
<P>
   To the man who snagged No. 70, Philip Ozersky, a soft-spoken
research scientist in St. Louis who makes $30,000 a year, the ball
represents a windfall. Ozersky, whose first thought had been to
give the ball to McGwire, finally and fitfully decided to put it up
for auction. ``I might as well find out what's out there,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Guernsey's, the Manhattan auction house, wants to upstage last
year's spectacle when it captured front pages by selling items from
the Kennedy White House, including Jacqueline Kennedy's pillbox hat
and John F. Kennedy's long johns. The sale is actually to begin
Tuesday in a weeklong Internet auction. These bids will then be
included in the live auction to be held at Madison Square Garden on
the evening of Jan. 12. ESPN, the cable sports network, will
broadcast the event.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the Hope Diamond of sports collectibles,'' Arlan
Ettinger, Guernsey's owner, said.
</P>
<P>
   The McGwire ball has a strong supporting cast. Guernsey's is
also auctioning three other McGwire home run balls _ Nos. 63, 67
and 68 _ as well as three hit by Sammy Sosa, his 61st, 64th and
66th, his last. Other memorable memorabilia have also been tossed
in. There is the ball Hank Aaron slammed for his 755th homer, the
career record. There is a baseball signed by Babe Ruth and Roger
Maris (the two previous record-holders for most home runs in a
season before McGwire and Sosa), and another signed by Babe Ruth
and Lou Gehrig. There is a single lot consisting of 50 souvenirs
from last year's world champion Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   And there may be more. The other day, Ettinger unabashedly took
a phone call in front of a visitor. The caller had something to
sell. ``Not to be difficult, but we're very, very difficult in what
we'll accept,'' Ettinger said in a practiced refrain.
</P>
<P>
   Then he began to squint, seemingly pondering. He expressed
carefully measured interest. ``If the ball is ever worth a lot of
money, I can't imagine circumstances when it will ever be worth
more,'' he purred.
</P>
<P>
   Hey, what ball? ``A very famous ball of Mickey Mantle's,''
Ettinger finally whispered, before excusing himself to continue the
conversation in a back office. ``I can't say anything more. It's
too sensitive.'' (The ball turned out to be the one hit for
Mantle's 500th home run and will be on sale at the auction.)
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   If all this sounds like hype, Ettinger almost agrees. As an
example of the thought transcending the object, he points to his
1988 sale of 200,000 pre-Castro Cuban cigars for as much as $10,000
for a box of 25. They were known to be unsmokable.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at half the collections out there, they tend to be
mass produced, with no thought to their being valuable,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   For Ozersky, value arrived magically. He was sitting in a party
box with about 100 colleagues from work. A baseball fan, he has
attended more than 200 ball games. The seats had been reserved
months earlier. He sipped a beer as McGwire swung at the first
pitch in his final at-bat of the season. Pow! The line drive
crashed into the box, ricocheting off a wall. Ozersky dived under
temporary bleachers to retrieve it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to sort out what the feeling was,'' he said. ``There
was that feeling of awe.''
</P>
<P>
   Security workers for the Cardinals hustled him to a room under
the seats. They authenticated the ball by checking its number (73
because it was the 73rd ball used in the game), and by verifying a
mark under ultraviolet light, two procedures devised for last
season's home run chase. He was offered the usual deal, one that
ball catchers had routinely leapt at: He could give the ball to
McGwire personally in return for autographed paraphernalia.
</P>
<P>
   Ozersky hesitated. McGwire left for the off-season. The fan said
he would have had a hard time not returning the ball in a personal
meeting, though the slugger has made clear the baseballs are not
one of his big priorities anyway. Ozersky put the ball in his
pocket and went home. He slept beside the ball. Then he took it to
work to show his friends.
</P>
<P>
   Then things got serious.
</P>
<P>
   The ball went into a safety deposit box. Ozersky thought he
might face an enormous tax bill if he gave the ball away. He
scrambled to find insurance. His phone rang off the hook, even
though he had just moved and changed his number. Some callers
offered money, $1 million from three partners in one case.
</P>
<P>
   He turned to his cousin David Krathen, a malpractice lawyer in
Fort Lauderdale, Fla. Krathen assigned the case to another cousin,
Michael Freedland, who, like Ozersky, is 26. Being the same age,
they had always hung out together at family reunions, though they
lived more than 1,000 miles apart. Ozersky scheduled a mid-October
visit to Florida so he could also take in a St. Louis Rams football
game in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   Gift taxes seemed to dictate that the ball must be sold. But how
and where? He hoped it could be displayed at the Baseball Hall of
Fame or somewhere comparable and that at least some of the proceeds
could go to charity. Offbeat schemes were pouring in, like one to
sell the ball's threads separately for big bucks. Then the leather
could be restuffed and sold. His lawyers scoffed.
</P>
<P>
   But to auction or not to auction? ``If you take a private offer,
you know what you're getting and walk away,'' Freedland said.
</P>
<P>
   Enter Michael Barnes, a St. Louis agent who represents artists
and athletes. He had put together the other baseballs that will be
sold at the Madison Square Garden auction, and was eager to add the
big one to his stable. Ozersky allowed him merchandising rights.
He's selling 70 prints of the big ball for $2,500 each and 7,000
posters for $70 each.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes helped Ozersky contact Professional Sports
Authenticators, a California firm, which marked the ball with a DNA
smear. Then it destroyed that batch of DNA, so all that remains is
the imprint on the ball and the written formula. This, more than
the ball's other markings, guarantees its authenticity.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes emphasized the captive _ price-driving _ energy that an
auction can release. ``If they don't leave that night with a ball,
they'll never have a chance again _ unless it hits the resale
market,'' Barnes said.
</P>
<P>
   Ozersky went back and forth. His representative haggled with
Ettinger in a manner that the tough-minded auctioneer called
``brutal.'' Even as late as 11 the night before the Dec. 7 news
conference with Sammy Sosa and other dignitaries, Ozersky would not
confirm he would appear. Then he showed up, carrying the ball in a
backpack.
</P>
<P>
   He is absolutely aware that an auction is precarious. He could
end up receiving less, considerably less, than the $1 million he
has already been offered. There is no minimum price, or at least
not one the auction house is willing to reveal. ``I didn't go to
the game to make any money,'' Ozersky said. ``Whatever it brings,
it brings.''
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, he came to think of the auction as a
once-in-a-lifetime experience. ``One of my goals is to have fun,''
he said. ``This is a chance to share the fun with my family.''

CHARLES EARL COBB, 82, MINISTER AND ADVOCATE FOR CIVIL RIGHTS,
DIES  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Rev. Dr. Charles Earl Cobb, a civil rights advocate who led
a major Protestant commission on racial justice, died Dec. 27 after
a lengthy illness. He was 82 and lived in Washington, where he
died.
</P>
<P>
   Cobb leapt to national prominence from the pulpit of St. John's
Congregational Church in Springfield, Mass., in 1966, when he was
named executive director of the United Church of Christ's
Commission on Racial Justice, which he had helped form three years
before. Working within the predominantly white denomination, the
group had dual goals of combating racism within the church and
strengthening the black community.
</P>
<P>
   Cobb was a defender of the Wilmington 10, a group of young
people accused of arson and conspiracy in the burning of a grocery
store in Wilmington, N.C., in 1971. He pushed his church to pay
$500,000 bail and $250,000 in other legal costs for the defendants,
one of whom had been sent to Wilmington by Cobb to help black
students integrating the local high school. Their convictions were
later overturned.
</P>
<P>
   Cobb made headlines in 1977, when he criticized William F.
Buckley Jr. for questioning Vernon Jordan's leadership of the
National Urban League.
</P>
<P>
   At his own church in Springfield, Dr. Cobb focused on young
people, starting a basketball program and buying a bus to ferry
students to historically black colleges in the South. He ran
unsuccessfully for mayor of Springfield in 1965, in part to protest
the teaching of ``Little Black Sambo'' in reading classes.
</P>
<P>
   The Commission on Racial Justice continued its emphasis on
higher education, providing scholarships to 4,000 college students.
Cobb also started a program for women in prison, and was arrested
on picket lines protesting South Africa's apartheid government.
</P>
<P>
   Cobb was a founder of the National Conference of Black
Christians, and served on the boards of TransAfrica, the
Interreligious Foundation for Community Organization and the Black
United Fund.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Durham, N.C., in 1916, Cobb graduated from Howard
University and received a master's degree from Boston University
and a doctorate from Huston-Tillotson College in Austin, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, Dr. Martha Cobb; three children,
Adrienne Brooks, Ann Cobb and Charles Cobb; 14 grandchildren and
four great-grandchildren.

CHICAGO DIGS OUT, BUT STORM CRIPPLES AIR TRAVEL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Eds: Changes ``angles'' to ``angels'' in 3rd from last graf.)  (lb) 
 By DIRK JOHNSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ Pummeled by the most ferocious snowstorm in more than
30 years, this high-stepping city, after being slowed to a crawl,
started to come back to life on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 2 feet of snow blanketed the city, left by a storm so
furious that at times on Saturday street plows sat idle in
futility. By Sunday afternoon, however, after an army of city
workers had scraped and swept with a vengeance, the streets became
passable.
</P>
<P>
   Getting in or out of town by air, however, remained problematic.
O'Hare International Airport, the United States' busiest, and
Midway Airport struggled to get back to normal on Sunday after
virtually shutting down on Saturday. There were still plenty of
canceled flights and long delays for travelers returning from the
holidays. Some 400 people had slept on cots and benches inside the
airport on Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, air travel throughout the eastern half of the nation was
disrupted Sunday, as the snow and ice in the Midwest, coupled with
heavy sleet and rain on Sunday morning in the Northeast as the
storm moved eastward, resulted in hundreds of canceled flights and
thousands of disgruntled passengers.
</P>
<P>
   In the New York area, the storm and the ripple effects from the
Midwest stranded or delayed thousands of travelers at Kennedy, La
Guardia and Newark International airports as airlines scratched or
rescheduled flights and threw out their timetables.
</P>
<P>
   With water a foot deep on the JFK Expressway leading to Kennedy
Airport, traffic was halted for more than two hours at
midafternoon, and witnesses told of chaos as riders abandoned
stalled taxis and cars and, with luggage and children in tow,
streamed like refugees for the terminals a mile or two away.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is extremely frustrating,'' Adena Muchnik, 26, of New
York said as she and her husband, David, hobbled along the
roadside, struggling with three suitcases and two small children in
strollers, trying to catch a 3:45 flight to Australia. It was
already 3:15, and the dream was dying. ``If we don't make the
flight to Melbourne, we might be out of a vacation,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The storm, which barreled up from the Gulf Coast on Friday, also
dumped heavy snow on Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Michigan, Minnesota,
Missouri, Nebraska, Ohio and Wisconsin.
</P>
<P>
   The weather was blamed for more than 20 deaths in the Midwest,
including 10 in Illinois. Many were the result of traffic
accidents. A 130-mile stretch of Interstate 65 in Indiana reopened
Sunday after being closed on Saturday, but many counties in the
state still banned unnecessary travel.
</P>
<P>
   ``The roads were like ice,'' said John Rawlings, who spent the
night with 200 other travelers at a church near Lafayette, Ind.,
after his van slid off I-65. ``The wind just picked it up and put
it in the ditch,'' Rawlings told The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   In the Northeast on Sunday, it was rain that turned highways
across the region into running rivers, downed power lines in parts
of Connecticut, caused 200 accidents on the New York Thruway, and
toppled rainfall records in New York's Central Park, where 2.42
inches eclipsed a 1936 mark for the date by more than an inch, and
in Bridgeport, Conn., which had 2.71 inches.
</P>
<P>
   Harsh as it was, the storm might have been much worse if
temperatures, which hovered in the 40s most of the day, had been 10
or 15 degrees lower, and the precipitation had turned to snow,
weather experts said. A meteorological rule of thumb is that every
inch of rain would have been a foot of snow.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would have been a big snowstorm,'' Todd Miner, a
meteorologist with Pennsylvania State University, said. ``As it
was, all the snow was dumped in the Midwest.''
</P>
<P>
   The 22 inches that was dumped in Chicago was the most in one
storm since 1967. Indeed, for all its reputation for tough winter
weather, the city had not had more than a foot of snow from any one
storm since 1978.
</P>
<P>
   And in a city where where almost everything is viewed through
the prism of politics, the storm prompted plenty of parlor talk
about the infamous snowstorm of 1979, a mess that contributed
mightily to Jane Byrne's upset victory of the incumbent mayor,
Michael Bilandic. Bilandic had been regarded by voters as being
indifferent to the suffering of Chicagoans, in particular
neglecting black neighborhoods on the South Side.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Richard M. Daley, running for re-election this year
against Rep. Bobby Rush, made himself highly visible during this
storm, casting himself in news conferences as a general rallying
the troops.
</P>
<P>
   ``This task will be enormous,'' said Daley. ``Please be
patient.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The storm followed a remarkable stretch of weather in Chicago
during the last months of 1998, mild temperatures, brilliant
sunshine and skies that seemed as blue as Lake Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   For now, the blankets of snow have given the city an almost
angelic cast, a look of purity and cleanliness.
</P>
<P>
   ``Man, it's just beautiful,'' said Tom Amenda, 41, a stock
trader.
</P>
<P>
   Amenda and his wife, Mary Shannon, a 38-year-old teacher, had
spent the afternoon shopping, and making snow angels in the yard of
their Wicker Park neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   Struck by how quickly the city's streets had been cleaned,
Amenda expressed gratitude for nature's good timing.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're going to have a blizzard in Chicago,'' said Amenda,
``you want to have it during an election year.''

 &HT;    49ers snatch victory from Packers in wildcard thriller
 &HT;    By Len Pasquarelli
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Eight seconds from yet another cheesy ending to
their season, the San Francisco 49ers' recent past haunted them and
the future appeared satisfied to simply ignore a once-proud
franchise perilously close to sliding into the nearby bay.
</P>
<P>
   One play removed from the ignominy of a first-round playoff exit
_ and, worse, a sixth consecutive defeat to the Green Bay Packers _
third-year wide receiver Terrell Owens decided it was time for
somebody to consider the present.
</P>
<P>
   Who better, Owens figured, than him.
</P>
<P>
   ''Time to redeem myself and time to redeem this team,'' Owens
quietly recalled in the locker room when asked to conjure up what
went through his mind seconds before his 25-yard touchdown catch
lifted the 49ers to an improbable 30-27 victory which sends them to
the Georgia Dome on Saturday for a rubber-match with the Atlanta
Falcons.
</P>
<P>
   The NFC West foes split their regular-season series in '98, each
team winning at home, but the 49ers still are clearly chafed by
their 31-19 loss at Atlanta on Nov. 15. In the wake of that defeat,
San Francisco strong safety Tim McDonald vowed his team would fight
hard to earn another shot at the Falcons.
</P>
<P>
   While they will wait until this morning to fret over how a shaky
defensive front seven might even attempt to contain Falcons running
back Jamal Anderson, the 49ers will relish a fantastic finish that
at least allows them the opportunity to try.
</P>
<P>
   For that, they can thank Owens, who pulled in Steve Young's best
pass of an otherwise shabby performance by the quarterback with
only three seconds left in the game.
</P>
<P>
   The reception reversed a difficult day as well for Owens, who
unofficially had three drops in the game, including a third-quarter
bobble in the end zone when he had beaten Packers cornerback Craig
Newsome by four yards.
</P>
<P>
   It also made this a game for the ages.
</P>
<P>
   Most experts had speculated the rare first-round matchup of
teams more accustomed to battling for the conference title might
result in the finest wildcard contest of all-time. It may not have
reached that level, but the end result was that the Packers and
49ers provided great drama and pathos.
</P>
<P>
   ''When they scored,'' said Packers coach Mike Holmgren, who
politely refused to discuss his possible departure from Green Bay,
''you saw every emotion possible on that field. Their guys cried
tears of joy and our guys tears of despair. You don't just lose a
game like this. It goes a lot deeper than that. It becomes one of
the worst things that ever happened to you. This is a bitter,
bitter pill, believe me.''
</P>
<P>
   Four minutes before his game-winning catch, Owens let a
third-down pass slip through his fingers. The drop provided life
for the Packers and Brett Favre took advantage by moving his team
89 yards in nine plays. Favre's 15-yard pass to wide receiver
Antonio Freeman, who beat Niners corner Darnell Walker with a nifty
spin move, catapulted the Packers into a 27-23 lead with 1:56
remaining.
</P>
<P>
   ''At that point, I think a lot of guys felt like, 'Here we go
again,' '' said tailback Garrison Hearst, who offset a sagging
passing game with 128 yards on the ground. ''But this is a game
about character and we proved we have it.''
</P>
<P>
   In a corner of the San Francisco locker room, hidden beneath a
pile of towels and tape and rolled-up sweat socks, was a stuffed
monkey. One of the 49ers defenders, and no one was volunteering
names, had ripped the stuffing out of the fake simian. The trite
yet true symbolism was apparent. After losing three straight to
Green Bay and having three seasons end in playoff defeats to the
Packers, the monkey was off the backs of the 49ers at last.
</P>
<P>
   ''Next stop,'' said Walker, the former Falcons corner who still
makes his home in the Suwanee, Ga. area, ''is Atlanta.''

COMMENTARY: SOME ADVICE TO CHANGE OUR APPROACH TO CHANGE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By JOHN TIERNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Before Mayor Rudolph Giuliani or Gov. George Pataki
gives another rousing speech about New York's bright prospects for
the 21st century, he might take a look at a new book by a
journalist who lives in Los Angeles, Virginia Postrel. The book is
titled ``The Future and Its Enemies,'' and New York clearly belongs
with the enemies.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Postrel is one of those people who divide the world into two
kinds of people, and she's not satisfied with the
liberal-conservative dichotomy.
</P>
<P>
   Liberals are supposed to be the ones who welcome change, but
they're often just as reactionary as conservatives in opposing
innovation, whether it involves a new technology (like genetic
engineering) or a real-estate development. The Upper West Side of
Manhattan calls itself progressive but can't abide the prospect of
a new building.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Postrel proposes another dichotomy: stasis vs. dynamism.
Stasists, as she defines the term, believe that the future must be
managed. Some are nostalgists generally opposed to change, while
other stasists are technocrats determined to make any change
conform to their vision and regulations.
</P>
<P>
   Dynamists prefer to let changes proceed by trial and error, with
little central guidance. It's a philosophy that sounds a lot like
libertarianism _ not surprising, since Ms. Postrel is the editor of
the libertarian magazine Reason _although she says it's shared by
nonlibertarians on both the left and the right.
</P>
<P>
   It's the evolutionary approach, guided by lots of independent
``feedback loops,'' that's popular in Silicon Valley and on the
Internet, and that once flourished in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``New York will be a great city when it's finished,'' Will
Rogers said in the 1920s, and back then everyone in America got the
joke. New York was the symbol of perpetual change, the urban evil
despised by agrarians who extolled the timeless virtues of farms
and small towns.
</P>
<P>
   Manhattan's skyline appalled the stasist elite in cities like
Philadelphia, where tradition forbade any new buildings taller than
the statue atop its City Hall. New York was much less orderly. Its
famous skyscrapers and neighborhoods were built by countless
developers and homeowners who gradually learned from one another's
successes and failures.
</P>
<P>
   But eventually New York fell under the control of master
planners like Robert Moses, whom Ms. Postrel presents as the
ultimate stasist technocrat. He casually razed entire neighborhoods
to make way for his grand vision of the future, which did not allow
for any feedback from the nonexperts who only happened to live
there.
</P>
<P>
   The results were so disastrous that the next generation of
technocrats became obsessed with neighborhood preservation, and
their myriad regulations have made it difficult to build anything
at all. In their own stasist way, they have all but eliminated the
experimentation that once created New York's neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani took office vowing to shake the city out of its
lethargy, and he's succeeded in some ways. He has simplified some
of the regulations on housing and businesses, and his war on crime
has been a triumph of the dynamist method. The police in each
precinct, instead of following fixed rules imposed by central
headquarters, have learned what works by studying crime statistics
each week and tailoring their strategy to local conditions.
</P>
<P>
   But Giuliani is not at heart a dynamist. Like his role model,
former Mayor Fiorello La Guardia, he is a moralistic technocrat
fond of controlling everything, from crosswalks and the schools to
the economy. He practices a stasist economic policy, giving special
subsidies and dispensations to old established corporations while
small new firms are left to fend with the country's most onerous
taxes and regulations.
</P>
<P>
   ``New York's one saving grace,'' Ms. Postrel said Sunday, ``is
that it still attracts newcomers who provide an infusion of
dynamism. But New York's central planning mentality makes it harder
and harder for these creative people to build lives there _ to find
a place to live, open a business, educate their children. The risk
is that those people are going to head for more dynamic cultures.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Los Angeles? ``I don't like to make comparisons,'' Ms.
Postrel replied tactfully. ``We have our own stasist problems in
California with regulations and growth controls. But I will say
that when I go to New York, I don't feel like I'm seeing the
future. It's still a city that is largely living off its past.''

   Where once its inner-city neighborhoods were the preserves of
down-and-outs and office workers who fled hotfoot at sundown to the

   Above all, significant numbers of Denverites are abandoning the
suburbs and settling again in the heart of the city.

Tsukiji fish market, the place where sushi comes to die.

   It is a spectacle of noise and color, as aproned men drag carts

   SAN FRANCISCO _ ``Flaming'' _ an e-mail phenomenon characterized
by an outbreak of insults and tantrums of a kind that seems
particularly common online _ is only one peculiarity that the
Internet appears to have brought to the English language.
</P>
<P>
   According to various researchers, the Internet may also be
eroding the formal structure of the language, introducing errors of
grammar and spelling and making them acceptable, and winnowing away
at the overall complexity of English _ in other words, dumbing it
down. &QL;

   VIENNA _ The 18th-century Augarten Palace, once a Hapsburg
residence, is now the boarding-school home of the Vienna Boys
Choir. Behind its high walls the gardens and playing fields echo to
childish shouts and the soft thud of snowballs hitting woolly
coats.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the baroque palace, the school principal, Manfred Seipt,
sits in his office, wondering where the choir will get its next
artistic director from.
</P>
<P>
   The truth is that 500 years after Emperor Maximilian I recruited
12 boys by decree into the royal musical household, this unique
institution is in crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Its image took a battering a month ago when Agnes Grossman, the
choir's first female artistic director, said the boys were
exhausted, overworked, ruthlessly exploited for commercial profit
and being robbed of their childhood. &QL;

SPORTS COLUMN: A GARDEN EMBRACE FOR HOLDSCLAW
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Waiting outside the locker room Sunday in the arena
in which Chamique Holdsclaw dreams of playing professionally was
Dawn Staley, a pro point guard of renown who was, fittingly enough,
hoping to get paid.
</P>
<P>
   ``Got my money, girl?'' Staley asked Holdsclaw, with her hand
extended, palm turned up. ``I take checks.''
</P>
<P>
   Holdsclaw was not yet ready to ante up for the 3-point shooting
contest she lost, according to Staley, sometime last year. Instead,
she gave Staley a hug.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's always cracking on my game,'' Holdsclaw said after
giving Staley more ammunition, shooting 2 for 9 as Tennessee
handled Rutgers, 68-54, in Holdsclaw's first appearance at Madison
Square Garden. ``She's been e-mailing me all season, saying, `Shoot
the 3!' So I was coming down court once and I heard her yelling,
`Shoot the 3!'''
</P>
<P>
   Staley said, ``No, I was yelling, `Don't shoot the 3.'''
</P>
<P>
   Holdsclaw rolled her eyes and said, ``See what I'm saying?''
</P>
<P>
   Amidst a crowd of 15,735, a Garden record for a women's college
game, were Holdsclaw's one-time teammates and coaches at Christ the
King High School in Queens, her relatives, and friends, a group to
which Staley apparently still belonged. Holdsclaw said she could
take the barbed critiques, as much as she could live with one of
the worst offensive games of her four-year college career. Anyway,
she had nine rebounds, played spirited defense, her team won, and
the comedian Rosie O'Donnell was in the house. The day remained
special for a young woman from the playgrounds of Astoria, who had
been given this homecoming gift, a thank you for all she had done
for the program, by her coach, Pat Summitt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never had a player impact our team as much as Chamique,
and that's saying a lot because we've had more all-Americas and
Olympians than anyone in the history of the sport,'' Summitt said.
</P>
<P>
   Three seasons down, three national championship banners up in
Knoxville, Tenn. Despite one defeat going into next weekend's
showdown at top-rated Connecticut, Tennessee remains the favorite
for the Final Four in San Jose, Calif., next spring. If everything
goes according to the master plan, Holdsclaw will present a
bachelor's degree to her grandmother, as promised, and be back at
the Garden in a Liberty uniform by summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have nowhere else I can say I'd like to go now,'' Holdsclaw
said.
</P>
<P>
   She meant that there is no more rival league to the Women's
National Basketball Association, which is good news for the Garden,
bad news for her banker. With the folding of the American
Basketball League last month went three years worth of
leverage-building by the most telegenic collegian, No. 23 with
braids, in the history of the women's game.
</P>
<P>
   The gurus who run the WNBA will surely let Holdsclaw play in New
York because it makes dollars and sense for them. But she will be
joining David Stern's women's annex along with all those talented,
hardened refugees of the ABL. She will not get as much as she would
have last year, in a competitive market, before the ABL
disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   ``The WNBA has full control over women's pro basketball now,''
said Staley, who saved herself the trouble of being put out of work
by recently quitting the ABL for the WNBA. ``You've got overseas,
but if you want to play here, you're at their mercy. That's the way
it's going to be, even with a union.''
</P>
<P>
   The same union, by the way, Stern and company have been so
generous with for the last six months.
</P>
<P>
   Holdsclaw could have avoided the coming bear market by skipping
her senior season, and by now would have already pocketed three or
four hundred thousand, had a summer of pro ball under her belt. At
the Final Four last year, she said she didn't see the advantages of
turning pro. Sometimes, it takes a person older and wiser to point
them out. Sometimes, as Dean Smith did for Michael Jordan years ago
at North Carolina, it takes the coach to tell the player he or she
should go.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it was $20 million, I could see it,'' Staley said. ``But
for three or even four hundred thousand? You're better off getting
your degree.''
</P>
<P>
   This is a debatable point, at worst. Had Holdsclaw played in the
WNBA last summer, she could have been back in Knoxville, without
missing a class. She and Summitt obviously made other plans, hoping
to write a fourth championship chapter, to go with the
autobiographies the coach authored after each of the last two
seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Then it will time to turn pro, where, Staley said, Holdsclaw
might have a few more days like Sunday, when she lost the ball in
traffic and clanked jumpers off the side of the glass. Good as she
is, there are levels of this sport, just as there are for men.
``She'll probably be inconsistent at first,'' Staley said, ``but in
a year or two, she'll be a franchise player. She's over six feet,
she can handle the ball, she understands the team game and she can
shoot, except when I'm around.''
</P>
<P>
   With Staley watching, Holdsclaw scored 8 points. ``I know I can
get 30 the next night,'' she said, softly, almost apologetically.
``The sky's the limit.''
</P>
<P>
   For points. Not pay.

<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ ``Flaming'' _ an e-mail phenomenon characterized
by an outbreak of insults and tantrums of a kind that seems
particularly common online _ is only one peculiarity that the
Internet appears to have brought to the English language.
</P>
<P>
   According to various researchers, the Internet may also be
eroding the formal structure of the language, introducing errors of
grammar and spelling and making them acceptable, and winnowing away
at the overall complexity of English _ in other words, dumbing it
down. &QL;

   &UR; VIENNA BOYS CHOIR: VOICES OF ANGELS, LIVES OF SLAVES &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   by Katherine Butler &QL;
</P>
<P>
   VIENNA _ The 18th-century Augarten Palace, once a Hapsburg
residence, is now the boarding-school home of the Vienna Boys
Choir. Behind its high walls the gardens and playing fields echo to
childish shouts and the soft thud of snowballs hitting woolly
coats.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the baroque palace, the school principal, Manfred Seipt,
sits in his office, wondering where the choir will get its next
artistic director from.
</P>
<P>
   The truth is that 500 years after Emperor Maximilian I recruited
12 boys by decree into the royal musical household, this unique
institution is in crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Its image took a battering a month ago when Agnes Grossman, the
choir's first female artistic director, said the boys were
exhausted, overworked, ruthlessly exploited for commercial profit
and being robbed of their childhood. &QL;

<P>
   LOS ANGELES_ Los Angeles is the city that everyone loves to hate
_ including, it seems, 200,000 of its own inhabitants.
</P>
<P>
   That's how many people have signed a petition calling for the
secession of the San Fernando Valley, the suburban slice of Los
Angeles north of the Hollywood Hills, and the creation of what
could become the sixth largest city in the United States. &QL;

<P>
   Scarcely a year to go, and still no one can be confident that
the stroke of midnight next Dec. 31 will not release a plague of
little green bugs to usher in the new millennium.
</P>
<P>
   Panic is rising. Every household in Britain has been told to
stock up with two weeks' supplies, presumably of spam, margarine
and vindaloo curry, the national dish.
</P>
<P>
   Some people foresee the lights going out all over the world, as
power stations crash. Others say aircraft will go demented, along
with cars, trains, traffic lights, hospital equipment and the
numberless other bits of high-techery that make modern life worth
living (all those computer games of Christmas past).
</P>
<P>
   Launch-on-warning missiles will be released, nuclear weapons
will start spontaneously to fizz and, if any life at all continues,
stock markets will go into sullen decline, as a bug-induced
recession of apocalyptic proportions takes hold.
</P>
<P>
   Admittedly, the bugs are not going to have it all their own way.
A working-group of ``informatics'' experts, known as Y2K chiefs,
has just been convened at the United Nations in New York. They have
been instructed to ``address the difficulties, and facilitate a
useful exchange of experiences.''
</P>
<P>
   Reassured? Of course not. It is nerds and geeks and informatics
experts who got us into this fix in the first place. With the clock
ticking, it is no good looking to them to get us out of it.
</P>
<P>
   Bring on the people who really get things done _ ``the trumpets
which sing to battle and feel not what they inspire...the
unacknowledged legislators of the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, Shelley's poets are now the only ones likely to be able to
make the world safe for computerized civilization as we know it.
</P>
<P>
   And how? Well, by stopping the ticking of the damned clock.
</P>
<P>
   Smart alecks have come up with their silly ideas, such as
telling your computer or microchip that 2000 is really 1972, the
most recent year to have matching dates and days of the week.
</P>
<P>
   If it worked, that would buy 28 years in which to solve the
problem, or at least address the difficulties, and facilitate a
useful exchange of experiences.
</P>
<P>
   An alternative would be to say, ``All right, computers, listen
up: the calendar has been wrong from the start. Jesus Christ was
actually born around 6 B.C., so we've really passed the dreaded
2000 mark and you didn't even notice. It wasn't so bad after all.''
</P>
<P>
   Or you could do a Pope Gregory, or at least a variation of his
trick, which was to skip the ten days after Oct. 4, 1582 in order
to tidy up the Julian calendar, which had been losing a day a
century.
</P>
<P>
   But whether you go forward or back, you meet this difficulty:
why should computers respond any more readily to being fooled about
the date than to being told the truth?
</P>
<P>
   So over to the poets, those unacknowledged legislators of the
world, and, of course, to those they write about:
</P>
<P>
   Your face would stop a clock,
</P>
<P>
   For it's so passing fair
</P>
<P>
   That time itself would like to stop
</P>
<P>
   And linger there.
</P>
<P>
   Forget other proposals, the stopped clock is the only solution
to the millennium-bug problem. A pause will do everybody good: the
world has been in a dreadful rush for far too long, and in many
respects people are really getting ahead of themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Properly equipped, the poets can avert something that might be
quite unpleasant. Only one thing is missing: the face they need to
arrest the ticking. Let the search begin. The world has just 12
months (no little green gremlins need apply). &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   With every day that passes, matters get worse. The country is
drifting along in a state of neglect. Legislative programs are
unheard of. Reformist debate has stopped. The political atmosphere
is as poisonous as it has been since the 1960s. Iraq is bombed, and
half of America _ as well as much of the world _ wonders at the
president's motives.
</P>
<P>
   When Russia collapses, when markets stumble, when China gets
aggressive, when the next terrorist atrocity occurs, the world
still hopes America will take the lead. But how can it, when Bill
Clinton is about to go on trial before the Senate?
</P>
<P>
   Everyone wants this horror _ and horror is not too strong a word
_ to end. Had Clinton resigned in August, when he was forced to
admit that he had lied to his family, his colleagues and the
American people, he could have finished it there.
</P>
<P>
   He could still do so; and would do so, if he were capable of
shame or had any sense of honor. But Clinton is even less inclined
to resign today than he was before his impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   The vote to impeach was so partisan that it has rallied even
wavering Democrats behind him, and has hitched the polls a few
points higher in his favor. Where even the intimation of
impeachment shattered Nixon, it has strengthened Bill Clinton. He
will cling on to the last.
</P>
<P>
   How then can the paralysis be broken? At this point, only in two
ways.
</P>
<P>
   The first would be a quick trial in the Senate, which would
probably end in acquittal but would not rule out criminal
proceedings once Clinton had left office.
</P>
<P>
   The second would be a motion of censure: constitutionally
doubtful, but not objectionable, as long as it did not include
immunity from future prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   Two things are vital here. The first is speed, to get America
back to work. But more important is the second: that the president
should be made to face the consequences of his perjury before the
grand jury. He must be made to feel the weight of the damage he has
done.
</P>
<P>
   To be fair, blame for the damage should also be laid at other
doors. America has been so convulsed by this scandal, and the
public so revolted, because the process of bringing Clinton to book
has been tainted at every stage.
</P>
<P>
   The president was dogged by an independent counsel whose powers
were excessive and whose tactics were sometimes suspect. The
Supreme Court caused much of the paralysis by ruling that the Paula
Jones suit against a sitting president should proceed. That suit
itself was encouraged by the president's political enemies.
</P>
<P>
   The press _ including The Economist _ leapt into the Monica
story with both feet. As a result, although the machinery of
impeachment was gleefully cranked up, it soon felt wrong.
</P>
<P>
   The sense of shame and sadness that now engulfs many thoughtful
Americans comes not so much from sympathy for this president _
whose lying defiance deserves none _ as from worry at the
precedents that have been set for political vendettas against
elected presidents in future.
</P>
<P>
   As the new year dawns, there is some hope that the damage done
will not be lasting. In the Senate, at least, there is a desperate
urge for civility to undo the grandstanding rudeness shown by
Republicans in the House.
</P>
<P>
   If the Senate performs its duties with dispatch, and above all
with bipartisanship, some of the wounds may start to heal; though
it may take months, and even a trouncing in next year's elections,
before the Republican zealots in Congress start to grasp the havoc
they have caused.
</P>
<P>
   On a point of detail (though a large one) Congress should
review, and consider abolishing in its present form, the office of
the independent counsel when the statute comes up for renewal this
year.
</P>
<P>
   At present, an attorney-general has little choice but to appoint
such a counsel when there seems to be evidence of executive-branch
wrongdoing. But his brief is open-ended, his funding and his
subpoena powers almost limitless.
</P>
<P>
   The present statute, a reaction against the powerless
prosecutors of the Watergate era, did not envisage a Ken Starr
figure let loose on the White House. The office has diminished the
importance of Congress (as was seen most clearly in Watergate) in
checking the excesses of the president and his men.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court, too, has not emerged without bruising. As
soon as a pretext arises (though America might well hope one would
not arise soon), the court should revisit its ruling that sitting
presidents are liable to prosecution in civil suits.
</P>
<P>
   The justices, like the House Republicans in turn, have sometimes
seemed blustered into hard-line positions by their distaste for the
president's stonewalling. If calmer tempers can prevail, the three
main branches of government may be able to deal with each other
reasonably again.
</P>
<P>
   Yet that may take years. Although every arm of government, not
merely the president, has behaved in ways they are now beginning to
regret, dangerous precedents have been set.
</P>
<P>
   The presidency is a weakened and unattractive office,
impeachment has become a purely partisan instrument, and marginal
groups in Congress will now feel they have the power to overturn
the mandate of the people.
</P>
<P>
   It is high time everyone drew back, reviewed the damage, and
began to restore some of the rules and conventions that have kept
America free of such traumas in the past.
</P>
<P>
   But the first essential is the brisk, fair and appropriate
punishment of the man who, many months ago, might have spared his
country all this agony by behaving as an honorable president really
should. &QL;

<P>
   CAMP PENDLETON, CALIF. - In a sealed room in sprawling Camp
Pendleton, a Marine Corps base in California, a young corporal is
mastering the use of the most formidable weapon in his arsenal: his
brain.
</P>
<P>
   A CD-ROM-based simulator takes him through a variety of crises
in which he must make split-second decisions and issue instant
orders to cope with anything from a sudden burst of enemy gunfire
to the approach of a band of thirsty refugees or a roving CNN crew.
</P>
<P>
   The Camp Pendleton program is one example of how America is
changing the way it trains its armed forces, so that they can
handle a post-Cold-War world in which charging tank divisions are
less common than the chaos of ``low-intensity conflicts,'' the
jargon for peacemaking and peace-enforcement operations.
</P>
<P>
   In this new world, the decisions taken by a 19-year-old
crouching behind a bush with his finger on the trigger of an M-16
rifle or a laser-aimed missile can have enormous consequences for
the foreign policy of the West.
</P>
<P>
   The Marine Corps, smaller in size and less bureaucratic than its
larger cousins of the Army, the Navy and the Air Force, is helping
to shape these new training techniques.
</P>
<P>
   The 12-day, still-experimental course, of which the CD-ROM
simulator is one component, aims to give the young leaders of
12-man sections the decision-making skills and killing authority
previously reserved for company or even battalion commanders.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the things the Marines learn, such as how to stay under
cover, are standard military fare. Others, including the
counselling skills taught by psychologists, seem to come straight
from the world of New Age management gurus; but the young section
leaders seem to relish it.
</P>
<P>
   One aim of the new training system is to enable American
soldiers of the 21st century to handle the ``three-block war.'' The
phrase describes an operation in which they would simultaneously be
distributing food and medicine to frantic civilians in one part of
a city, quelling rioters and maintaining order in another, and
fighting guerrillas in a third.
</P>
<P>
   Americans have already seen variations of the three-block war in
Haiti, Somalia and Bosnia. Memories of the ill-fated rescue
operation in Somalia in 1993 still haunt the military planners,
especially the ``Ranger ambush'' in which a combined force of
Rangers and Delta Force commandos was trapped by Somali gunmen for
18 hours; 18 men were killed and 73 wounded.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Marines were not involved in that debacle, it is
with an eye on the lessons of Somalia that the corps is now putting
new emphasis on urban-warfare tactics and the need for first-class
leadership of small units.
</P>
<P>
   The new training goes hand-in-hand with the use of new military
instruments, such as the ``non-lethal munitions'' that will help to
give American troops a wider range of options when dealing with an
adversary than just trying to kill him.
</P>
<P>
   At one demonstration held for Camp Pendleton's senior officers,
the arsenal of weapons on show included beanbag projectiles fired
from shotguns and grenade-launchers, blinding pepper sprayed from
devices the size of fire-extinguishers, ultra-powerful flashlights
that can find and dazzle potential snipers, and grenades which
explode into a mess of adhesive foam that can block a doorway or
goo up a suspected guerrilla.
</P>
<P>
   But what Americans peering into the future of warfare call the
Revolution in Military Affairs, the RMA, also employs sterner
weapons than these.
</P>
<P>
   In future wars of the Bosnia sort, for instance, small numbers
of highly trained men with sophisticated weapons under their
control will be able _ it is hoped _ to defeat much bigger armies
of the conventional sort with little or no loss to themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Hidden on a hillside miles from the enemy, their fingers on
precision-aiming devices, and helped by eye-in-the-sky satellites
and reconnaissance aircraft, they will be able to steer long-range
missiles on to the enemy's tanks or guns; and the enemy will not be
able to fire back, because he cannot see them and, even if he
could, they are probably out of range.
</P>
<P>
   In such a fight, the weapons used by the warriors of the RMA
will by no means be confined to beanbags and gluey foam.
</P>
<P>
   A look at the equipment on display in Camp Pendleton makes the
point. Most of them have two barrels and two triggers: one for
firing non-lethal projectiles, the other for delivering the
old-fashioned, deadly kind. A switch of the trigger and the kinder,
gentler Marines of the 21st century instantly become lethal.
</P>
<P>
   The advocates of the RMA are determined to make sure that
America and its allies remain ahead of the rest of the world not
only in the military technology they possess but also in the skills
needed to use these weapons.
</P>
<P>
   And what happens when an adversary manages to manufacture, buy
or steal a collection of similar weapons, as he doubtless will?
Why, by then, say the confident optimists of the RMA, America and
its trusted allies will be deploying even newer devices that can be
fired with equal accuracy from still farther away.
</P>
<P>
   Some American officers, especially older ones, have their
misgivings. They say that a system of war built upon a wish to
destroy the enemy without yourself suffering any significant number
of casualties is inherently dangerous. Remember that 1993 disaster
in Somalia.
</P>
<P>
   New kinds of weapons, instructed by satellites and computers,
may be able to win future firefights of this sort more swiftly and
at less cost to your own men; but the men will still need to be
there, to occupy some vital hilltop or essential building, and they
will have to be prepared to take the consequences.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, your soldiers must face the risk of being wounded or
killed. Clever and brave guerrillas, fighting in places where they
are hard to detect _ forests or mountains or city side-streets _
have to be pursued by soldiers who are not only expertly trained
for such warfare but are also willing to engage the enemy at close
quarters.
</P>
<P>
   Any adversary, when defeated, leaves behind a region which has
to be occupied by your own side, to make sure he does not start the
war all over again; and your occupying force is bound to suffer
casualties.
</P>
<P>
   An army that believes it can avoid standing in harm's way is,
say the skeptics, liable to prove perilously fragile.
</P>
<P>
   The coming century is going to provide plenty of crises in which
deadly force, working in both directions, cannot be avoided. &QL;

</P>
<P>
   Americans have already seen variations of the three-block war in
Haiti, Somalia and Bosnia. Memories of the ill-fated rescue
operation in Somalia in 1993 still haunt the military planners,
especially the ``Ranger ambush'' in which a combined force of
Rangers and Delta Force commandos was trapped by Somali gunmen for
18 hours; 18 men were killed and 73 wounded.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Marines were not involved in that debacle, it is
with an eye on the lessons of Somalia that the corps is now putting
new emphasis on urban-warfare tactics and the need for first-class
leadership of small units.
</P>
<P>
   The new training goes hand-in-hand with the use of new military
instruments, such as the ``non-lethal munitions'' that will help to
give American troops a wider range of options when dealing with an
adversary than just trying to kill him.
</P>
<P>
   At one demonstration held for Camp Pendleton's senior officers,
the arsenal of weapons on show included beanbag projectiles fired
from shotguns and grenade-launchers, blinding pepper sprayed from
devices the size of fire-extinguishers, ultra-powerful flashlights
that can find and dazzle potential snipers, and grenades which
explode into a mess of adhesive foam that can block a doorway or
goo up a suspected guerrilla.
</P>
<P>
   But what Americans peering into the future of warfare call the
Revolution in Military Affairs, the RMA, also employs sterner
weapons than these.
</P>
<P>
   In future wars of the Bosnia sort, for instance, small numbers
of highly trained men with sophisticated weapons under their
control will be able _ it is hoped _ to defeat much bigger armies
of the conventional sort with little or no loss to themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Hidden on a hillside miles from the enemy, their fingers on
precision-aiming devices, and helped by eye-in-the-sky satellites
and reconnaissance aircraft, they will be able to steer long-range
missiles on to the enemy's tanks or guns; and the enemy will not be
able to fire back, because he cannot see them and, even if he
could, they are probably out of range.
</P>
<P>
   In such a fight, the weapons used by the warriors of the RMA
will by no means be confined to beanbags and gluey foam.
</P>
<P>
   A look at the equipment on display in Camp Pendleton makes the
point. Most of them have two barrels and two triggers: one for
firing non-lethal projectiles, the other for delivering the
old-fashioned, deadly kind. A switch of the trigger and the kinder,
gentler Marines of the 21st century instantly become lethal.
</P>
<P>
   The advocates of the RMA are determined to make sure that
America and its allies remain ahead of the rest of the world not
only in the military technology they possess but also in the skills
needed to use these weapons.
</P>
<P>
   And what happens when an adversary manages to manufacture, buy
or steal a collection of similar weapons, as he doubtless will?
Why, by then, say the confident optimists of the RMA, America and
its trusted allies will be deploying even newer devices that can be
fired with equal accuracy from still farther away.
</P>
<P>
   Some American officers, especially older ones, have their
misgivings. They say that a system of war built upon a wish to
destroy the enemy without yourself suffering any significant number
of casualties is inherently dangerous. Remember that 1993 disaster
in Somalia.
</P>
<P>
   New kinds of weapons, instructed by satellites and computers,
may be able to win future firefights of this sort more swiftly and
at less cost to your own men; but the men will still need to be
there, to occupy some vital hilltop or essential building, and they
will have to be prepared to take the consequences.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, your soldiers must face the risk of being wounded or
killed. Clever and brave guerrillas, fighting in places where they
are hard to detect _ forests or mountains or city side-streets _
have to be pursued by soldiers who are not only expertly trained
for such warfare but are also willing to engage the enemy at close
quarters.
</P>
<P>
   Any adversary, when defeated, leaves behind a region which has
to be occupied by your own side, to make sure he does not start the
war all over again; and your occupying force is bound to suffer
casualties.
</P>
<P>
   An army that believes it can avoid standing in harm's way is,
say the skeptics, liable to prove perilously fragile.
</P>
<P>
   The coming century is going to provide plenty of crises in which
deadly force, working in both directions, cannot be avoided. &QL;

<P>
   CHICAGO _ Nature abhors a vacuum. So do American entrepreneurs.
Consider a firm called Autopsy/Post Services (1-800-AUTOPSY),
founded in 1988 by Vidal Herrera.
</P>
<P>
   The frequency with which autopsies are performed in America has
been falling steadily for over three decades, and Herrera has made
his mark by leaping in to fill the void.
</P>
<P>
   Herrera charges $2,000 for a complete autopsy, more if the body
has been exhumed or if extra tests are ordered. Many of his
customers suspect foul play or malpractice. Others have medical
questions that a hospital or insurance company would not pay to
have answered.
</P>
<P>
   Herrera expects to perform roughly 800 autopsies this year; he
has turned away thousands of others across the United States, and
in other countries, because he could not handle them from his Los
Angeles base.
</P>
<P>
   That problem will soon be over; in January, Autopsy/Post
Services will begin selling franchises in 72 American cities and 16
countries.
</P>
<P>
   The success of 1-800-AUTOPSY aside, public-health experts are
alarmed by the falling number of conventional autopsies. In 1960,
roughly one in two deaths in Chicago area hospitals was followed up
with an autopsy; that rate is now about one in ten. Federal data
collected since 1972 show the same trend. Indeed, experts note that
autopsy rates are falling around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Autopsies can be used to determine the effectiveness of surgical
procedures and drug treatments. They provide accurate vital
statistics, teach medical students, uncover new diseases and spot
old ones that may be spreading. All the while, they sniff out
incompetent medical care and the odd murder that might have passed
for a slip in the bathtub.
</P>
<P>
   George Lundberg, editor of the Journal of the American Medical
Association (JAMA), points out that medical conditions such as
toxic shock syndrome and congenital heart disease (as well as many
others) were discovered by autopsy. Toxic shock has now been pretty
much stamped out; congenital heart disease can be treated
successfully with surgery.
</P>
<P>
   An autopsy is perhaps the only way for the dead to speak to the
living. Why are Americans listening less?
</P>
<P>
   One reason is cost. An autopsy can run up a bill from several
hundred dollars to several thousand, depending on the methodology.
In the days before the health-care system began slimming down, most
insurance policies covered the procedure. If not, hospitals
politely picked up the tab.
</P>
<P>
   No longer. As HMOs, insurance companies and hospitals struggle
to distribute scarce resources, they tend to favor the living over
the dead. (State and local governments have the right to demand an
autopsy in any case where foul play is suspected or the cause of
death is unknown.)
</P>
<P>
   Autopsy, like organ donation, is a difficult subject to broach
with grieving families (though the public good associated with both
can help the grieving process).
</P>
<P>
   The attending physician is the logical person to suggest a
post-mortem exam; yet all too often a doctor's primary concern is
covering his own gluteus maximus. An autopsy may prove a doctor
wrong, or even negligent.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors with better intentions may simply believe that more
sophisticated laboratory tests and imaging technology have made the
autopsy redundant. Alas, they have not.
</P>
<P>
   A study by researchers at Louisiana State University Medical
Center used autopsies to determine that doctors missed 44 percent
of cancerous tumors while patients were alive. Another study at the
University of Pittsburgh found a 45 percent discordance between
what clinical doctors diagnosed as the cause of death and what an
autopsy later showed it to be.
</P>
<P>
   In 1988, the JAMA ran an issue around the theme: ``Declaring war
on the non-autopsy.'' So far, it has been more of a slow retreat.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, the Journal took up the torch once again. An
editorial proposed a minimum autopsy rate as a condition for
hospital accreditation and/or Medicare reimbursement. Meanwhile
Herrera, looking ahead to a bulge of dying baby-boomers, foresees
endless opportunities. &QL;

<P>
   It is easier to start a fight with Iraq than to end one.
</P>
<P>
   So America and Britain discovered when they called off their
four-day bombing campaign against Iraq on Dec. 19, only to find the
Iraqis taking repeated potshots at their pilots ten days later amid
a row over the ``no-fly zones'' that cover half the country.
</P>
<P>
   So, indeed, the past eight years have shown, as successive
American and British governments have enforced the sanctions
imposed on Iraq after it invaded Kuwait in 1990. Has the latest
episode brought a conclusion any closer?
</P>
<P>
   The bombing did put an end, at least for the time being, to the
work of UNSCOM, the United Nations body charged with disposing of
Iraq's deadliest weapons.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of the American and British attack, Iraq announced
that the arms inspectors, who had fled the country hours before the
bombing began, would not be allowed back.
</P>
<P>
   Never fear, insisted American officials, their bombs had made a
significant dent in Saddam Hussein's weapons programs. General
Henry Shelton, America's top soldier, announced that nine Iraqi
missile factories had been put out of operation ``for at least a
year,'' while his British counterpart proudly described the
destruction of special aircraft designed to spray biological and
chemical stuff.
</P>
<P>
   The two powers also claimed to have blitzed barracks,
ministries, presidential palaces and various factories that might
otherwise, they said, have been put to nefarious purposes.
</P>
<P>
   But the Iraqis are dab hands at hiding their assets, as UNSCOM's
inspectors have long complained. They shrugged off the attacks,
insisting, quite credibly, that most of the destroyed buildings had
already been emptied of men and machinery.
</P>
<P>
   One serving UNSCOM inspector questioned the usefulness of the
bombing; he might also have asked why, if America and Britain knew
where to find Hussein's secret weapons, they had not let the
inspectors know.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the rest of the world was equally unimpressed. Russia's
President Boris Yeltsin called the strikes ``illegal and
senseless'' and briefly recalled his ambassadors from America and
Britain.
</P>
<P>
   France protested by pulling its aircraft out of the force that
has been patrolling the no-fly zone over southern Iraq (it had
earlier withdrawn from the northern patrol).
</P>
<P>
   Arabs took to the streets throughout the Middle East, storming
the American embassy in Damascus and demonstrating in Rabat. Their
embarrassed governments protested more mutedly, but did complain
that the bombing had undermined any hope of persuading Iraq to
cooperate with the U.N. and thus be rehabilitated into the world.
</P>
<P>
   America and Britain retort that they are as keen as everyone
else to sort out the whole mess. After they called off their
bombers, they produced a new five-point strategy for dealing with
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   They will keep up their threat of force, encourage the Iraqi
opposition, try to get inspections under way again, step up patrols
of the Gulf against sanctions-busting smugglers and launch a
diplomatic offensive to bring the world around to their point of
view.
</P>
<P>
   As energetic as all this sounds, it amounts to almost nothing.
Hussein has weathered many bombings, and doubtless thinks he can
survive a few more. The Iraqi opposition is laughable, and the $97
million earmarked for it by America even more so (each of the 325
cruise missiles fired at Iraq during the bombing campaign cost $1.2
million).
</P>
<P>
   America's only plan to get the inspectors back into Iraq is to
refuse to lift sanctions until they have finished their work.
Although smugglers do get around the sanctions, they do so chiefly
through Iran and Syria, where America has little influence, or
through Turkey, where it winks at the infractions.
</P>
<P>
   And America is already trying to persuade the rest of the world
to swallow its Iraqi policy, with ever-dwindling success.
Essentially, America and Britain plan to let Iraq stew.
</P>
<P>
   The Iraqis complain that they have been left to stew painfully
for eight years under the most all-encompassing sanctions in
history, with no hope of a reprieve. All along Hussein has tried to
protest and prod until the international consensus on sanctions
falls apart.
</P>
<P>
   Although frustrating UNSCOM was his favorite means of attracting
attention, he is already testing new methods of challenging
America's stranglehold. The current spate of attacks on aircraft in
the no-fly zone, or his renewed threat to end the U.N.'s
humanitarian program, could both bring about a new crisis.
</P>
<P>
   So far, no country has broken ranks and openly defied the
sanctions, although several _ especially the Arab states _ have
called for their lifting.
</P>
<P>
   But with UNSCOM out of action, it will become ever harder for
the Americans to argue that the unending embargo is designed to
enforce the internationally accepted aim of arms control, rather
than to serve America's and Britain's interest in keeping Hussein
(together with the unfortunate Iraqi people) contained in a cage.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq has complained that Arab foreign ministers delayed a
meeting to discuss the situation at the behest of such good
American allies as Saudi Arabia. They are unlikely to delay
forever. &QL;

   Much of the rest of the world was equally unimpressed. Russia's
President Boris Yeltsin called the strikes ``illegal and
senseless'' and briefly recalled his ambassadors from America and
Britain.
</P>
<P>
   France protested by pulling its aircraft out of the force that
has been patrolling the no-fly zone over southern Iraq (it had
earlier withdrawn from the northern patrol).
</P>
<P>
   Arabs took to the streets throughout the Middle East, storming
the American embassy in Damascus and demonstrating in Rabat. Their
embarrassed governments protested more mutedly, but did complain
that the bombing had undermined any hope of persuading Iraq to
cooperate with the U.N. and thus be rehabilitated into the world.
</P>
<P>
   America and Britain retort that they are as keen as everyone
else to sort out the whole mess. After they called off their
bombers, they produced a new five-point strategy for dealing with
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   They will keep up their threat of force, encourage the Iraqi
opposition, try to get inspections under way again, step up patrols
of the Gulf against sanctions-busting smugglers and launch a
diplomatic offensive to bring the world around to their point of
view.
</P>
<P>
   As energetic as all this sounds, it amounts to almost nothing.
Hussein has weathered many bombings, and doubtless thinks he can
survive a few more. The Iraqi opposition is laughable, and the $97
million earmarked for it by America even more so (each of the 325
cruise missiles fired at Iraq during the bombing campaign cost $1.2
million).
</P>
<P>
   America's only plan to get the inspectors back into Iraq is to
refuse to lift sanctions until they have finished their work.
Although smugglers do get around the sanctions, they do so chiefly
through Iran and Syria, where America has little influence, or
through Turkey, where it winks at the infractions.
</P>
<P>
   And America is already trying to persuade the rest of the world
to swallow its Iraqi policy, with ever-dwindling success.
Essentially, America and Britain plan to let Iraq stew.
</P>
<P>
   The Iraqis complain that they have been left to stew painfully
for eight years under the most all-encompassing sanctions in
history, with no hope of a reprieve. All along Hussein has tried to
protest and prod until the international consensus on sanctions
falls apart.
</P>
<P>
   Although frustrating UNSCOM was his favorite means of attracting
attention, he is already testing new methods of challenging
America's stranglehold. The current spate of attacks on aircraft in
the no-fly zone, or his renewed threat to end the U.N.'s
humanitarian program, could both bring about a new crisis.
</P>
<P>
   So far, no country has broken ranks and openly defied the
sanctions, although several _ especially the Arab states _ have
called for their lifting.
</P>
<P>
   But with UNSCOM out of action, it will become ever harder for
the Americans to argue that the unending embargo is designed to
enforce the internationally accepted aim of arms control, rather
than to serve America's and Britain's interest in keeping Hussein
(together with the unfortunate Iraqi people) contained in a cage.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq has complained that Arab foreign ministers delayed a
meeting to discuss the situation at the behest of such good
American allies as Saudi Arabia. They are unlikely to delay
forever. &QL;

49ER OWENS MAKES A CATCH THAT ELIMINATES THE PACKERS
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By THOMAS GEORGE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ There were two Green Bay Packers behind him and
two more in front of him, and by the time the pass play was over
there were two more around him, all falling into a pile smack in
the middle of the Green Bay end zone. That made six, more than half
of the Packers on the field, on the heels of Terrell Owens when the
clock struck three seconds. When time in 3-Com Park nearly stood
still.
</P>
<P>
   The 49ers beat the Packers, 30-27, here Sunday afternoon in a
National Football Conference playoff game that will stand forever
as one of the most memorable not only in 49ers' history but also in
National Football League history.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the ball is thrown down the middle like that in that
situation, you never think it is going to be caught,'' said Green
Bay Coach Mike Holmgren. ``Never.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Steve Young looked left,'' said Packers free safety Darren
Sharper, who was standing in the end zone in front of Owens on the
play and who was the first to collide with Owens. ``Then Steve
Young came back underneath with the pass to Terrell Owens. Owens
went up and made a play. We just didn't jump. We didn't go for the
ball.''
</P>
<P>
   Packers end Reggie White was desperately trying to sack Young.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't see it,'' White said. ``I just heard it. I heard
the roar.''
</P>
<P>
   And he knew what had happened. Just like all of the Packers did.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw a blur,'' said Packers receiver Antonio Freeman, in
shock on the Packers sideline. ``Stuff like that doesn't happen.
It's going to be tough to accept.''
</P>
<P>
   It didn't seem real. Owens jumped highest. Did you see it?
Certainly, you heard it. The roar. The blur. Time stood still. And
then this stadium, these 65,506 fans, this San Francisco 49ers team
that looked drilled one more time by Green Bay, got up and wiped
the dust away and rewrote history.
</P>
<P>
   And they won it on Young-to-Owens, a 25-yard touchdown pass,
with 3 seconds left. Green Bay, only 1:53 earlier, had grabbed the
lead on a Brett Favre to Antonio Freeman touchdown pass of 15 yards
that had given Green Bay a 27-23 lead. It looked like Green Bay had
made it six consecutive victories over San Francisco, four straight
in the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   And then Young-to-Owens.
</P>
<P>
   The 49ers have had so many big, winning plays, from Joe Montana
to Dwight Clark for The Catch and from Montana to John Taylor to
win a Super Bowl. So many more, but for this group, this was their
own thing, their own destiny, a chance to shine and reach for
something that few in this crew had ever experienced. They move on
now with a 13-4 record to play the Atlanta Falcons on Saturday.
Green Bay's season ended with an 11-6 record.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have never made a bigger catch in my life, never played in a
bigger game and never been more thankful to the Lord that I got a
chance to redeem myself to my teammates,'' Owens said of his
winning score, the most unlikely of plays that actually began with
8 seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess you can call it The Redemption,'' Owens, 25, said,
smiling, flashing braces, a 6-foot-3-inch 217-pound receiver from
Tennessee Chattanooga who is in only his third pro season.
</P>
<P>
   Owens had dropped four passes Sunday and had fumbled once.
Through most of the game he looked as if he were in a mental funk.
Owens said the Packers had begun taunting him in the third quarter.
He said they chided, ``You haven't made a play all day! Hero!
Zero!'' It hurt, he said. So, when he made the winning catch, he
was in tears. Tears of joy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just thankful,'' Owens said of his emotion. ``I have
been thinking about beating Green Bay since last season, for all of
this season. I have wanted us to get the chance to do something
about the way they have handled us. I was open over the middle on
the play before. Steve this time just came right back to me. I saw
it all of the way. And once I was there, I wasn't going to let them
knock it away or knock it loose.''
</P>
<P>
   This was a game that Green Bay led, 17-10, at halftime. Young
threw a 1-yard touchdown in the first half, Favre threw a 2-yard
score and Packers back Dorsey Levens ran for a 2-yard score. But
San Francisco won the third quarter by 10-0 to take a 20-17 lead,
and that set up the final quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Both teams hit field goals to start the quarter, making it
23-20. Then came Freeman's catch. Then came Owens' catch.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco started its drive at its 24 with 1:56 left.
Young's 17-yard pass to J.J. Stokes began the drive. Then another
pass to Stokes for 9 more. Short stuff by Young kept moving the
ball, chipping away. Green Bay adjusted by doubling its defense on
the edges, trying to keep the sideline defensed and forcing the
49ers to try something risky over the middle. Young passed to Rice
for a 6-yard gain to the Green Bay 41. Replays showed Rice fumbled
when hit but it was not called. The drive would go on. History
would move forward, subtly changing. Young with :08 left tried a
pass toward Stokes again and it hit Packers cornerback Craig
Newsome squarely in the hands. Newsome bobbled it. Dropped it.
</P>
<P>
   History kept moving forward. Subtly changing.
</P>
<P>
   ``You just don't lose a game like this; it's the worst thing
that can happen,'' Holmgren said.
</P>
<P>
   But 49ers cornerback Marquez Pope countered: ``To go through
something like this, to beat that team this way after what they
have done to us, it is very special. To win this game and it being
a playoff game and win it like this? We have much more football to
play, but this will last a lifetime.''

BRUINS LIVE UP TO THE HYPE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The accolades began before they set foot on
campus. Longtime UCLA watchers called it the best freshman class
since Wooden. Recruiting gurus tagged it the nation's No.1 class.
</P>
<P>
   But it was empty praise until Saturday night, when the Bruins'
JaRon Rush-less freshmen combined for 36 points and 16 rebounds in
an 82-75 victory over No.6 Arizona. In particular, center Dan
Gadzuric (10 points, three blocks) and forward Jerome Moiso (21
points) had impressive Pac-10 debuts.
</P>
<P>
   A few minutes later, the rookies earned their highest compliment
to date from Wildcats coach Lute Olson.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's an unbelievably talented basketball team,'' Olson said.
``I've been (in the league) 16 years, and I've never seen a better
freshman class than that one. I've never seen anybody even close to
the ability of the two big freshmen.''
</P>
<P>
   Minute men: A depleted roster Saturday whittled UCLA's 10-man
rotation to seven and forced several Bruins to play more minutes
than normal.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins were without Rush, the suspended forward who's
expected back tonight against Arizona State, and forward Matt
Barnes was limited to six minutes because of an ankle injury
suffered during Christmas break.
</P>
<P>
   Baron Davis played 34 minutes, six more than his previous high.
Moiso hit the 30-minute barrier for only the second time this
season, and guard Ryan Bailey topped 20 minutes for the first time
in a month.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Steve Lavin said fatigue was a factor in the final
minutes, when Arizona chopped a 20-point deficit to five, and he
canceled Sunday's practice to give the Bruins a chance to recover
for Arizona State.
</P>
<P>
   Taking care of Terry: UCLA geared its defense to contain Arizona
point guard Jason Terry, perhaps the best guard in the Pac-10 and a
potential first-round draft pick. The Bruins used a two-pronged
strategy: a zone press that force Terry to distribute the ball in
the backcourt, then a tight man-to-man that denied him return
passes in the halfcourt offense.
</P>
<P>
   It worked well. Terry made two field goals in the first half and
scored just 10 points in the first 35 minutes, as UCLA built its
20-point lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a great playmaker, so we tried to get the ball out of his
hands,'' guard Earl Watson said. ``We watched the video, and teams
backed down and let him get the ball near halfcourt. We just denied
him. We didn't back down.''
</P>
<P>
   Erasing the memory: Ten months ago, Davis cried in his locker
after missing a last-second jumper against Arizona in the season
finale.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was thinking about that before (Saturday's) game, how I
missed the shot to send it to overtime,'' he said. ``I have so much
more confidence and poise this season.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis is steadily regaining strength in his surgically
reconstructed left knee, improving his quickness and jumping
ability by the week. Saturday, he had 20 points and six assists and
was closer to his former self than at any point this season.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA vs. ARIZONA ST.
</P>
<P>
   Time: 7:30 p.m., Pauley Pavilion &QL; 
TV/Radio: Fox Sports West 2; XTRA-AM (1150) &QL; 
UCLA (9-2, 1-0) update: The Bruins have won seven straight and must
avoid an emotional letdown after a spirited victory over Arizona.
Freshman forward JaRon Rush will play _ but not start _ after
serving a one-game suspension for missing two practices and a game
because of homesickness. Forward Matt Barnes (ankle) is expected to
play limited minutes. Bruins were outrebounded 48-31 by Arizona and
must get more production from center Dan Gadzuric, who had two
rebounds in 19 minutes. &QL; 
Arizona State (8-5, 0-1) update: Sun Devils haven't won in Pauley
Pavilion since 1987 and have lost 19 straight overall to UCLA. They
have three of the league's best players in guard Eddie House and
forwards Bobby Lazor and Mike Batiste. They combine for almost 16
points per game. Under new coach Rob Evans, ASU plays with more
discipline than in past years, which could cause UCLA problems. &QL;

YOUNG TROJANS FEEL PAC-10 INTENSITY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Several of USC's players got their introduction to
the Pacific-10 Conference during Saturday's victory over Arizona
State, and noticed it was no longer as relaxing as playing American
University or Arkansas State.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were a lot more prepared for us than other teams,''
center Brian Scalabrine said. ``The guys are stronger. (Arizona
State forward) Michael Batiste is really strong. I'll get used to
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Guard Quincy Wilder also picked up on the increase in the game's
intensity.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a different type of game. A lot of defense, not a lot
of transition baskets,'' Wilder said. ``A lot of halfcourt
offense.''
</P>
<P>
   Just in case newcomers like Scalabrine and Wilder didn't
understand that the season changes during Pac-10 play, they got a
little speech from senior guard Elias Ayuso.
</P>
<P>
   ``I only have 20 more games in my college career. This is it for
me and I told the guys this is the big show,'' Ayuso said. ``This
is the biggest show. The nonconference games, you play teams that
are good but not that good.''
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Washington: With his career-high 13 points, and penetration,
USC fans got their first chance to see Wilder demonstrate the
ability that earned him the title Mr. Washington three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen him for four years. I have been waiting for that,''
said Scalabrine, who played at Highline Community College in Des
Moines, Wash., with Wilder. ``That's typical of Quincy when it
comes down to big games. That's exactly how he is. He's
aggressive.''
</P>
<P>
   Averting an upset: USC (9-1, 1-0) overcame an 18-point deficit
to defeat Arizona State, and more importantly, avoided dropping its
home opener. That would have been devastating considering how
competitive the conference is expected to be this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would have hurt because you don't lose at home,'' Ayuso
said. ``That's our goal, not to lose at home.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It would have been real tough because Arizona is coming in
(today) and we'd be 0-1,'' Scalabrine added. ``You can't lose home
games.''
</P>
<P>
   Equal time: USC picked up its ninth victory Saturday, which
equals its total for all of last season, when the Trojans were
9-19.
</P>
<P>
   No. 6 ARIZONA AT USC
</P>
<P>
   Time: 1 p.m., Sports Arena. &QL; 
TV/Radio: No TV; XTRA-AM (690). &QL; 
Arizona (8-1, 0-1) update: The Wildcats had their first loss of the
season Saturday against UCLA, and will be trying to avoid opening
conference play by getting swept. Senior guard Jason Terry is
averaging 20.2 points while center A.J. Bramlett is averaging 15
points and 11 rebounds. The Wildcats are young, starting two
freshmen _ forward Michael Wright and guard Richard Jefferson _
along with sophomore forward Justin Wessel. &QL; 
USC (9-1, 1-0) update: After surviving a scare against Arizona
State, when they trailed by as many as 18 points, the Trojans get a
much tougher test today. A key to the game could be point guard
Quincy Wilder's defense on Arizona's Jason Terry. Wilder helped
shut down Arizona State's Eddie House with his defense Saturday.
Brian Scalabrine, who scored 25 points against Arizona State, is
averaging 23 points in his past three games. &QL;

MEMO TO NBA: DROP DEAD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Here's the final proposal from us, da fan, as we
view this half-cocked idea of making Thursday the do-or-die date
for playing half an NBA season _ which is as typically presumptuous
as a Michael Jordan comeback:
</P>
<P>
   Owners, you stick with your demands.
</P>
<P>
   Players, you stick with your dreams.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, we decide it with a free throw _ taken by Shaquille
O'Neal.
</P>
<P>
   He makes it, go with the players' deal.
</P>
<P>
   He misses, go with the owners' deal.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, we can't get the players to agree to that, so...
</P>
<P>
   In that case, pull the plug. The damage is irreversible and
we're out of patience....
</P>
<P>
   _Results from an ESPN.com Internet poll asking ``With David
Stern's `drop dead' date coming, do you think there will be a
season?'' Almost 60 percent of the 14,438 voters responded ``Don't
care.''...
</P>
<P>
   _Michael Olowokandi's threats to play in Italy are no baloney.
If the Kinder Bologna team signs him today, as reported, the
Clippers can't stop him, they can only hope to contain him....
</P>
<P>
   _Kareem Abdul-Jabbar could be the Clippers' coach by the time
they move into the Staples Center....
</P>
<P>
   _NHL vice president of communications Bernadette Mansur, on why
the league doesn't market itself more to get those NBA fans who
have nothing to watch: ``We don't have the same demographics as NBA
fans. Our (fans) are more affluent and educated.''...
</P>
<P>
   _The Dodgers have sent out letters inviting folks to one of two
90-minute Q-and-A gatherings _ with a Stadium Club hot-dog buffet _
they have set up with manager Davey Johnson, CEO Bob Graziano and
GM Kevin Malone to ``discuss our vision for the 1999 Dodger team.''
One of the meetings is next Monday _ show up at 10 a.m. and see the
usually no-fans-allowed players' winter workouts at Dodger Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, wait a sec. These invites are only for the Dodgers'
preferred season-ticket holders from the dugout, field and loge
levels. Sorry, bleacher scums....
</P>
<P>
   _This should be the year when the arrogant-for-no-reason
baseball writers allow Nolan Ryan, George Brett, Robin Yount,
Carlton Fisk (begin ital)and(end ital) Tony Perez into C'town's
pearly gates. When Tuesday's ballots are made public, though, don't
be stunned when only Ryan and Brett get their hands stamped....
</P>
<P>
   _John Madden calls Sunday's San Fran-Green Bay playoff game
``one of the greatest we've ever seen.'' Duh....
</P>
<P>
   _And the ball is still loose from Jerry Rice's fumble....
</P>
<P>
   _Sugar Bowl halftime entertainment act Roger Staubach put up
better stats than Troy Aikman_ did in that NFC mild-card effort....
</P>
<P>
   _The next proposed adjustment to the Rube Goldberg-looking Bowl
Championship Non-Series is adding a fifth category to determining
the rankings _ the margin of victory against Top 25 opponents. One
that Steve ``I'm Giving Myself The Game Ball'' Spurrier fully
endorses....
</P>
<P>
   _It would make sense if Chris Claiborne, R. Jay Soward and Kris
Farris jump to the NFL _ and avoid the embarrassment of walking
around campus after what happened last week....
</P>
<P>
   _Trojans teammates were grumbling that Claiborne, who helped USC
hold Texas Christian to just 314 yards rushing, musta gained about
30 extra pounds from the banquet circuit between the end of the
regular season and the Sun Bowl....
</P>
<P>
   _If Farris wanted to come up with a movie title to describe the
Rose Bowl, it could be ``Farris' Bruins' Day Off.''...
</P>
<P>
   _For a change, USC's switch to a 1 p.m. tipoff for today's
basketball game against Arizona has nothing to do with a conflict
over a birthday party previously planned for a coach's wife. Why
UCLA didn't adjust its tipoff with Arizona State _ it'll go up
against the Pseudo Bowl between Tennessee and Florida State in
ASU's Sun Devil Stadium _ doesn't make much sense. &QL;

THINK OF IT AS KEITH JACKSON.COM

 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TOM HOFFARTH  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
LOS ANGELES _ There's research out there that some 20 million homes
in American have a television set in the same room as a personal
computer. Half of those are computers with Internet access.
<TEXT>
<P>
   So, if one out of every 100 uses the new Enhanced TV PrimeTime
Football interactive Web site tonight that works in concert with
the live Fiesta Bowl coverage on TV, the guys at Disney think
they'll be on the ground floor of something kinda neat.
</P>
<P>
   The Enhanced TV site (http://etv.go.com/ mnf/website/index.html)
is billed as neither a TV experience nor a computer experience, but
something to be appreciated simultaneously. Call it a WebTV event
without the WebTV system. Dexterity is a key.
</P>
<P>
   For example, when boring old television starts coverage of the
Tennessee-Florida State game, the site will be serving several
functions:
</P>
<P>
   A push channel will send game-related graphics and stats on a
relay system from the gamesite in Tempe, Ariz., to the transmitter
in New York and then to the site's homebase in Seattle within
seconds. It's better than pop-up video.
</P>

   &UR; By JOHN McCLAIN &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Mike Holmgren likely coached his last game with
Green Bay on Sunday, and he is expected to be named the new head
coach/general manager of the Seattle Seahawks.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco coach Steve Mariucci, who is taking his team to a
second-round game at Atlanta, is expected to finally sign the
long-term contract extension with the 49ers that has been sitting
on his desk for weeks.
</P>
<P>
   After the Packers' 30-27 loss to San Francisco, Holmgren refused
to address reports about his imminent departure from Green Bay,
where he has coached since 1992.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, I'm not going to deal with that,'' Holmgren said.
</P>
<P>
   Holmgren, who led the Packers to the last two Super Bowls, has a
clause in his contract that gives him a 21-day window to sign with
another team if it offers him the dual job titles of coach/general
manager. Sources close to Holmgren said he will be hired by the
Seahawks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just not going to talk about it,'' Holmgren said when
pressed on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Packers general manager Ron Wolf, who hired Holmgren from the
49ers in 1992 and inserted the clause in his contract last year,
didn't want to talk about it, either.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's 1999, and I've been talking about Mike Holmgren since the
last Super Bowl,'' Wolf said. ``I'm not going to comment on it
now.''
</P>
<P>
   Holmgren made an appearance in the 49ers' dressing room to
congratulate them on the victory. He singled out Mariucci, his
former quarterbacks coach in Green Bay.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm proud of the job Steve's done here because I consider him
as one of my guys,'' Holmgren said. ``Today, I don't feel good
about things, but when I said, `Good luck the rest of the way' to
him, I meant it.''
</P>
<P>
   Packers quarterback Brett Favre has not given up hope that
Holmgren might return.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope he stays, because he's done wonders for my career,''
Favre said. ``I don't know what's going to happen, but I know it's
going to be a very interesting offseason.''
</P>
<P>
   For weeks, there has been speculation that Holmgren would leave
Green Bay for San Francisco, his hometown. With president Carmen
Policy and director of football operations Dwight Clark moving to
the Cleveland Browns, the deck was cleared to offer Holmgren
whatever he wanted.
</P>
<P>
   The speculation left Mariucci hanging. There were reports he
would be reunited with Policy and Clark in Cleveland. Other reports
said he would replace Holmgren in Green Bay. Mariucci grew up a
Packers fan in Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   Like Holmgren, Mariucci wouldn't say much about his job
situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a long week, to be honest with you,'' Mariucci said
about the increased reports last week that he would be replaced by
Holmgren. ``Somehow, you have to focus on the game, bury yourself
in your work and do the best you can.''

CIVIL LAWSUIT AS A TOOL AGAINST TERRORISM 
</HEADLINE>
  (rl) 
 By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST ORANGE, N.J. _ Amid the staggering shock and numbing grief
after his daughter Alisa, 20, was killed in April 1995 in a
terrorist bombing while studying in Israel, Stephen Flatow fell
back on his instincts as a lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   He was determined to make the culprits pay, even if they were on
the other side of the world. But how?
</P>
<P>
   Khaled al-Khatib, 22, the Palestinian who crashed a van packed
with explosives into a bus Alisa was riding through the Gaza Strip,
died in the blast. Other suspects have since died or are in foreign
prisons and are unlikely to be extradited. As for so many others
whose relatives have been killed by terrorists, justice seemed
elusive.
</P>
<P>
   Undeterred, Flatow, whose expertise is in title insurance, set
off into the murky waters of international law and foreign
relations. In March 1998, in federal court in Washington, he won a
landmark $247.5 million judgment against the government of Iran for
supporting Islamic Holy War, the terrorist group that claimed
responsibility for the blast, which killed Alisa and seven Israeli
soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   He has found that trying to force Iran to pay up is an even more
daunting task. Flatow, who is seeking to seize Iran's former
diplomatic properties in the United States, has become a thorn in
the side of State Department officials. His efforts threaten to
complicate further the two countries' relations.
</P>
<P>
   Flatow presses on. ``I am not sure I know what closure is
anymore,'' he said at his home here. ``It's a word that the
psychiatrists and the psychologists talk about. When you have a kid
snatched from you, I don't think it ever really closes.''
</P>
<P>
   Flatow's civil lawsuit against Iran, brought under the 1996
Antiterrorism Act, is part of what legal scholars say is a growing
global interest in finding new ways to achieve international
justice. The ruling against Iran was the first time a foreign state
had been held liable in a U.S. court for a terrorist act committed
outside the United States. But even though Congress passed two
amendments to the law to help strengthen Flatow's case, he has yet
to collect a cent.
</P>
<P>
   Immediately after U.S. District Judge Royce Lamberth ruled
against Iran, federal lawyers stepped in to block Flatow's legal
team from seizing Iran's former embassy and other diplomatic
properties.
</P>
<P>
   Experts in international law agree that diplomatic property is
sacrosanct. But Flatow and his lawyers are back in court,
determined once again to set a precedent. They have lobbied
President Clinton's national security advisers and accused
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright of siding with Iran over an
American citizen.
</P>
<P>
   Until the death of his oldest daughter, Flatow (pronounced
FLAY-toe) was never one to take up causes. If he is an unlikely
crusader, it is less surprising that Alisa was his inspiration.
Flatow, a round-faced man who wears a yarmulke, was not an
observant Jew until 4-year-old Alisa insisted on attending an
Orthodox Jewish day school.
</P>
<P>
   The rabbi who was the principal of the school assured Flatow
that Alisa's attendance would not change the family's lifestyle.
``He lied,'' Flatow said, saying that he and his wife, Rosalyn,
felt compelled to reinforce the lessons Alisa learned at school by
becoming more observant. ``The Israeli experience was part of
her,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Flatow is not alone in his battle. Sen. Frank Lautenberg,
D-N.J., happened to be in Israel when Alisa was killed and has
taken a personal interest in the case. Lautenberg and Rep. H. James
Saxton of Mount Holly, N.J., sponsored the amendments to the
antiterrorism act.
</P>
<P>
   Other victims of terrorism, including the families of Matthew
Eisenberg and Sarah Duker, U.S. students killed in a Jerusalem
bombing in 1997, are planning similar suits. Flatow's lead lawyer,
Steven Perles, an authority on international law who has sued and
represented several foreign countries, mostly in commercial
litigation, contends that civil lawsuits can be an effective weapon
against terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you are going to be hounded for the rest of your life,
there will be no safe haven,'' Perles said. ``That will have a
deterrent effect. If you know you may be tried as a criminal before
an international tribunal, that will have a deterrent effect. And
if a nation knows it is going to be on the receiving end of
enormous civil judgments, that will be a deterrent.''
</P>
<P>
   The Iranian government ignored the Flatow action. After the
ruling, Iran's U.N. mission issued a statement saying Iran ``has
consistently condemned terrorism in all its forms.'' The statement
said the Flatow lawsuit was based on ``legislation that flouts one
of the most fundamental principles of international law.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton administration officials express sympathy and support
for Flatow's claim, but he has clearly made life more difficult for
State Department officials charged with conducting policy toward
Iran. The two countries have not had diplomatic relations since the
seizure of hostages from the U.S. Embassy in Tehran in 1979, though
there have been recent hints of a possible warming in ties.
</P>
<P>
   Iran's former embassy and ambassador's residence in Washington,
properties Flatow's lawyers hope to seize, remain in the custody of
the State Department, which has been renting them out and has kept
the proceeds in a bank account. Officials have cited numerous
reasons for keeping the properties from becoming enmeshed in the
Flatow case, including concerns about insuring the sanctity of U.S.
diplomatic properties abroad.
</P>
<P>
   There are also legal complications surrounding the properties
dating back to the 1979 crisis, including efforts by Iran to
reclaim them. ``We are confident that we are protecting U.S.
interests as a whole,''a State Department official said.
</P>
<P>
   Flatow has been traveling the country giving speeches about
Alisa to raise money for Israel and other Jewish causes, including
a scholarship fund established in Alisa's memory that helps send
American students to Israel. Flatow and his wife have four
surviving children, whom they continue to send to Israel. A
daughter, Francine, 19, is studying there now.
</P>
<P>
   ``The terrorist, his idea, his goal, is not only to kill the
people on the bus or in the marketplace,'' Flatow said. ``It's also
to accomplish a political motive by getting Flatow to stay home,
getting someone to leave Israel. It's this randomness that, on the
one hand, makes it so scary, and on the other, it makes you say,
you have to fight back. And you get the tool to fight back by
living your life.''

QUICK ACTION CALLED ONLY ALTERNATIVEW TO TRIAL
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE E. KORNBLUT 
c.1999 The Boston Globe  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As senators continued bickering over a proposal to
accelerate a presidential impeachment trial, a chief architect of
the plan warned Sunday that the deal is in danger of dissolving if
members fail to embrace it this week.
</P>
<P>
   Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, the Connecticut Democrat who joined
forces with Republican Senator Slade Gorton of Washington to form
the bipartisan proposal, said there was only a ``very small
window'' of time that the plan could prevail. After that,
constitutional procedures would kick in, probably accompanied by
growing party discord.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we don't have an agreement, I fear we're going to slide
back into the pit of partisanship and rancor we saw in the House,''
Lieberman said. ``I think if we don't have this worked out by the
end of this week ... we're going to revert to what the Senate rules
at this point provide for a trial.''
</P>
<P>
   The admonition came as members of the House and Senate trickled
back into town, many trumpeting their views on the trial in the
days before the 106th Congress is called to order on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats presented an almost united front, supporting the
Lieberman-Gorton notion of a pretrial trial in which the Senate
would hear limited evidence, then vote on whether to move ahead to
the full case. It would take 67 votes for a trial to start; if the
vote &UR;  &LR; failed, a move to censure Clinton could begin.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, no trial is expected to start until all members of
the Senate have been sworn in as jurors and Supreme Court Chief
Justice William H. Rehnquist is summoned to preside _ not until,
presumably, next Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans, however, continued to disagree with not only
Democrats but with one another, arguing Sunday whether it is legal
to consider censure, whether it is constitutional to hold an
abbreviated trial, whether presidential testimony should be
required and what to do about the State of the Union address,
scheduled for Jan. 19.
</P>
<P>
   Senator Phil Gramm, Republican of Texas, said he was in favor of
an ``expedited trial.'' But when it came to the Lieberman-Gorton
proposal, Gramm said he could not envision a constitutionally sound
way of bypassing trial proceedings, saying he did ``not see how you
can begin the trial, and then turn right around and vote without
hearing all the facts.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Doing it quickly is not as important as doing it right,''
Gramm said.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, Senator Arlen Specter, Republican of
Pennsylvania, also repeated his opposition to the proposal,
describing himself as a ``stickler for the Constitution.''
</P>
<P>
   Specter added a new wrinkle to the debate: insisting that
Clinton not only stand trial but also testify as a witness.
</P>
<P>
   Specter said he was determined to hear from Clinton, saying that
``what the trial would offer, which we have not had until the
present time, is the testimony of the president.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be my hope that the president would come forward
voluntarily,'' Specter said on NBC's ``Meet the Press.''
</P>
<P>
   Another Republican, however, disagreed. Arkansas Representative
Asa Hutchinson, a member of the House Judiciary Committee who has
been designated as a trial manager, said of Clinton's proposed
testimony, ``That's his choice.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He could be acquitted through all of this,'' Hutchinson said
on ABC's ``This Week with Sam Donaldson and Cokie Roberts.''
</P>
<P>
   Hutchinson also said he believed a trial could move quickly
without a purposely accelerated schedule such as the one proposed
by Lieberman and Gorton. It ``would not be a protracted endeavor
unless the White House wanted it to be a protracted endeavor,''
Hutchinson said.
</P>
<P>
   Members also touched on the timing of the president's State of
the Union address, which is mandated by the Constitution. Some said
the president should not address the country until a trial is over.
Lieberman said a delay is part of his proposal and that if an
abbreviated trial appeared nearly over on that date, Clinton should
postpone the speech. But if he would have to wait several weeks,
Lieberman said, he would be wise to proceed with it.
</P>
<P>
   Partisan rancor spilled over slightly into the debate among
senators, as members of each party tried to cast their own ideas as
better for the nation at large. Gramm reminded his colleagues
Sunday that an impeachment trial would not be about punishing
Clinton but was instead ``about protecting the republic.'' Later,
Lieberman said avoiding such a trial through his proposal was ``in
the national interest.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The bipartisan proposal is not made to make it easier for
senators,'' Lieberman said. ``If there's not two-thirds prepared to
remove the president, then the net effect of carrying on a trial
... will only hurt the country and the Senate. I surely hope we can
avoid that.''

NO SECOND-GUESSING FOR PAXON AS HE LEAVES CONGRESS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By JAMES DAO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   AMHERST, N.Y. _ Bill Paxon, the exuberant five-term Republican
congressman who many people thought could have been the next
speaker of the House, was maneuvering his Ford Tempo through a cold
rain recently when his cell phone rang. It was an urgent call about
the house. The one in Alexandria, Va., that is, with the torn-up
kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   In his clipped Buffalo twang, Paxon instructed his wife, former
Rep. Susan Molinari, to make sure their contractor did not damage
any electric lines. Then he hung up and refocused on the business
of the day: saying goodbye to his district staff and preparing to
start life anew in a strange land called the private sector.
</P>
<P>
   So goes life out of the political lane for a man who has ridden
in it for nearly half of his 44 years. But Paxon has yet to show
any sign that he regrets his decision to retire from Congress last
year, just months before his dream job, speaker of the House,
became available _ twice.
</P>
<P>
   Paxon, who will begin work this week as a senior adviser to the
influential law and lobbying firm of Akin, Gump, Strauss, Hauer &AMP;
Feld, says he is completely at peace with his decision, even though
it will require leaving a profession he describes as narcotic and
an institution he calls ``the world's best fraternity.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I convinced my dad to run one last time for judge in the
1970s, and he lost,'' Paxon said, looking rather uncongressional in
cowboy boots, a flannel shirt and khaki pants. ``He always said _
and he was right _ `There is a time to put this stuff aside.' He
had been in office since the '40s. You have to know when to fold
'em in politics.''
</P>
<P>
   Many people felt this was not Paxon's time to quit. Politics _
conservative, Reaganesque politics _ seems to have boiled in his
veins since his childhood in Akron, south of Buffalo.
</P>
<P>
   Displaying the aw-shucks grin and boyish optimism that would
remain his trademarks for two decades, Paxon was elected to the
Erie County Legislature in 1977 at age 23, fresh out of Canisius
College. He went on to serve in the state Assembly from 1984 until
winning a seat in Congress in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, Paxon became an acolyte of Newt Gingrich, the
Georgia Republican, and their fates seemed to rise and fall
together. In 1993, Paxon became chairman of the National Republican
Congressional Committee, helping to engineer the 1994 campaign that
gave the Republicans control of the House for the first time in 40
years.
</P>
<P>
   When Gingrich became speaker the following year, Paxon was part
of his inner circle, becoming the chairman of the Republican
leadership, a position Gingrich created for him. Paxon was viewed
by many Republicans as the rightful heir to the speakership.
</P>
<P>
   But in 1997, a group of conservative Republicans started, then
aborted, a coup against Gingrich. Though it is widely thought that
Paxon had nothing to do with the revolt, the plotters let it be
known that they were interested in making Paxon the speaker.
</P>
<P>
   In a move that some of his closest friends considered naive,
Paxon resigned from the leadership, sacrificing himself to help
reunite the fractious Republican caucus. Yet his standing in the
caucus seemed to grow. Amid simmering dissatisfaction with both
Gingrich and the House majority leader, Dick Armey of Texas,
Republicans again began to float Paxon's name for one of those two
posts in late 1997.
</P>
<P>
   This time, Paxon openly joined the campaign, saying he was
seriously considering challenging Armey after the 1998 elections.
As majority leader, Paxon would be next in line to replace Gingrich
if the speaker quit Congress to run for president, as Gingrich was
then hinting he would.
</P>
<P>
   (As it turned out, Gingrich resigned shortly after the
Republicans' weak showing in last November's elections. A month
later, his designated replacement, Bob Livingston of Louisiana,
announced he would resign after disclosing that he had had
extramarital affairs.)
</P>
<P>
   But last February, Paxon stunned his staff and Congress by
announcing that he would retire at the end of 1998. He said he
wanted to spend more time with his wife and their daughter, Susan
Ruby, who is 2. The couple are expecting their second daughter
later this month.
</P>
<P>
   To this day, skeptics wonder why he threw in the towel. Some say
Paxon knew he could not defeat Armey and could not face a future as
a backbench congressman with no clout. Others say Armey or his
allies threatened him, which Paxon denies.
</P>
<P>
   What made up his mind, he insists, was the realization that he
would not see his daughter grow up if he joined the leadership. In
his methodical way, he had concocted a chart showing the days he
would need to spend fund raising, campaigning for members and doing
district work. The slice labeled ``family'' was alarmingly small.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being speaker of the House or majority leader would have
required me to spend the last eight months traveling instead of at
Chuck E. Cheese or Discovery Zone,'' he said. ``I wouldn't trade
one minute of that time with my child to be the speaker.''
</P>
<P>
   What helped, he said, was watching his wife, who quit an equally
promising political career to work in television, an ill-fated job
that she has since left. ``I looked at Susan, who I always felt had
a much greater political future than I did, that she was able to
just put it down, walk away, start something else, close the
door,'' he said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   It was family that dominated his conversation at a farewell
lunch for his staff in the 27th District. Over a club sandwich and
fried calamari, Paxon reflected on Susan Ruby's obsession with
Barbie dolls, her bright-eyed wonderment at the family Christmas
tree, her penchant for announcing, ``You have no power here!'' when
she is angry with him.
</P>
<P>
   Though one aide shed a tear as Paxon distributed gifts _ the
same ones he gives every year: White House Christmas ornaments _ he
seemed not the least bit wistful.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps that is because he does not plan to be out of politics
completely. Paxon said he will continue to help candidates he
likes, including perhaps the Republican nominee for president in
2000.
</P>
<P>
   He also plans to maintain his close ties to the man who is
expected to become the next speaker, Rep. Dennis Hastert, R-Ill.
(The two men share a passion for antique cars). Though Paxon says
he will not lobby Congress, his relationship with Hastert and other
senior Republicans could greatly benefit the Fortune 500 companies
he will advise.
</P>
<P>
   Paxon was never much for legislating _ he sponsored only 21
bills over the last six years, fewer than many freshman members do
in a single year. And as he reflected on his Washington career, he
expressed the most pride in his political work, particularly in
1994.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, the greatest achievement I could ever have is being
involved in us winning that majority,'' he said, pointing to
reductions in the welfare rolls, tax cuts and the balanced budget
that he says resulted from that majority. ``The nuances of
continuing to govern are best left to others, not me.''
</P>
<P>
   Paxon is not concerned about the impact of his retirement on New
York's congressional delegation, already weakened by the departures
of other senior members. His seat will be filled by his friend
Thomas Reynolds, the former minority leader of the state Assembly.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you leave a legislative body, in your mind you might be
leaving a huge hole,'' he said. ``But the reality is, it's a hole
that's like a hand coming out of a bucket of water. It fills
quickly.''

   NEW YORK _ As a frigid night gave way to a dismally wet morning,
homeless people across New York City Sunday continued what for many
will be a winter-long ritual: the search for a warm place to sleep.
</P>
<P>
   Some trickled into city shelters, lured from streets where
temperatures dropped to an overnight low of 24 degrees. Others
clung tenaciously to their coats and blankets and vowed to stay out
of the shelters for as long as possible.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday morning, Melvin Ford and Ronald Joyner kept each other
company on the steps of the Broadway-Lafayette Street subway
station, thawing for a while before stepping out again to ask
passers-by for change. Sometimes, they said, they sat inside a
fast-food restaurant a while or hunted for an extra-long church
service
</P>
<P>
   ``Trust me, these shelters are trouble, said Ford, 45. ``They
get crazy there and maybe they steal your sneakers.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the shelters began to fill up over the last week, said
Patrick Markee, an advocate with Coalition for the Homeless, a
private group that monitors city shelters. Last Wednesday, when the
temperatures dropped to 17 degrees, extra cots were set up at two
men's shelters, in Harlem and Washington Heights.
</P>
<P>
   The shelter system for single adults can accommodate about
7,400. So far this winter, Markee said, an average of 7,000 have
stayed there each night.
</P>
<P>
   Most homeless people with children had little choice but to turn
to the city-shelter system. There, dozens of them out on the floor
of a city office, despite a long-standing court order and recent
legislaton to prevent such a situation. On Saturday evening,
according to advocates for the homeless, 55 families _ with 65
children among them _ camped out on the floor and slept on chairs
at the city's Emergency Assistance Unit, the main intake center for
homeless families, on East 151st Street in Mott Haven, the Bronx.
Most of those families have bounced for months between the intake
office and 10-day temporary placements across the city, while their
eligibility for more-permanent shelter is reviewed.
</P>
<P>
   The number of families on Saturday was nearly twice the center's
nightly average of about 30, according to Steven Banks, director of
Legal Aid's Homeless Rights Project.
</P>
<P>
   Such overnight stays are exactly what the City Council sought to
stop with the ordinance it passed over Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's
veto two weeks ago. One of the ordinance's provisions requires the
city's homeless agency to provide families with a bed for the night
_ and a crib, when needed. Families should be transferred to a
nearby shelter overnight and returned in the morning so city
investigators can continue verifying their claims of homelessness,
instead of waiting at the intake office overnight, the bill's chief
sponsor, Stephen DiBrienza, said Sunday,
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing we are trying to avoid is the sleeping on desks,
chairs, the floor,'' the Councilman said Sunday, ``One could argue
they are breaking the law.''
</P>
<P>
   The new law echoes previous court orders that also barred the
city from keeping homeless families in city offices overnight and
imposed substantial fines if they were kept there for more than 24
hours.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, it wasn't unusual to find families staying at the
Bronx office for several days. Now, city officials say, the wait is
less than 24 hours. The city has already paid $5 million in fines.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, a spokeswoman for the city's Department of Homeless
Services, Susan Wiviott, would not say how many families had stayed
overnight at the Bronx office in recent days, nor how many homeless
families were currently being evaluated. But she said that the
city's shelter system could sufficiently accommodate families in
legitimate need of a home.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have plenty of space,'' Ms. Wiviott said.
</P>
<P>
   But while city officials maintain that enforcing eligibility
rules for shelter help keep out those with other housing options,
advocates for the homeless contend that genuinely needy families
are turned away.
</P>
<P>
   The overnight stays at intake center are ``completely a function
of the city's refusal to make use of available shelter beds rather
than any new influx of families,'' said Banks, whose group has
turned to the courts to enforce its earlier ruling.
</P>
<P>
   Edith Nunez, an HIV-positive mother of two, sat bundled up in a
blanket on the floor of the Bronx intake center all night long,
with her husband and her 17-month-old daughter at her side. In the
middle of the night, she said, an ambulance took her younger
daughter, barely 4 months old, to a hospital emergency room to be
treated for a throat infection.
</P>
<P>
   ``I spent the night here, but who the hell can sleep here?'' Ms.
Nunez said Sunday afternoon, awaiting another transfer to yet
another motel. ``It's loud and everyone inside is dying to find a
place to live.''

`PATCH ADAMS' DELIVERS SWEET MEDICINE DESPITE STORMS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DAVE MCNARY  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Universal's medical comedy ``Patch Adams''
continued writing a winning prescription at the nation's box office
but severe snow storms kept many Middle Americans at home during
the New Year's weekend, studio sources said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Patch Adams'' easily topped the Friday-Sunday period with
$19.6 million at 2,752 theaters to give the Universal release $66
million after 10 days. However, the Robin Williams project might
have matched its $25.3 million opening weekend if Midwest weather
had not been so fierce.
</P>
<P>
   ``The box office was decimated,'' said Robert Bucksbaum,
president of the Reel Source service, who noted that grosses on
Saturday -- usually 40 to 50 percent above Friday -- came in under
Friday's performance for the first time in memory. One executive
estimated at least $30 million in lost business as the Indiana,
Illinois, Michigan, Minnesota and Ohio markets were virtually
closed down.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd say the couch potatoes won this weekend,'' said movie
analyst Arthur Rockwell, pointing out the plethora of football on
TV also held down grosses. He noted the current slate is strong
enough to recapture some of the weekend's lost revenues eventually
but added, ``A lot of that business is lost for good.''
</P>
<P>
   Had the storms not hit, Bucksbaum said, overall grosses would
have topped the record-setting $148.3 million total set during the
three-day Christmas weekend. He pointed out the box office had also
suffered an unexpected blow during the pre-Christmas weekend due to
President Clinton's impeachment, adding, ``It's really been
Murphy's Law at the box office lately.''
</P>
<P>
   Two films aimed at the date crowd battled for second with Sony's
second weekend of ``Stepmom'' leading with $15 million at 2,358
theaters, followed by Warner Bros.' third weekend of ``You've Got
Mail'' with $13.9 million at 2,776 sites. ``Stepmom'' has topped
$50 million overall while ``Mail'' has delivered $77.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   A trio of family films took the next slots, led by DreamWorks
SKG's third weekend of ``The Prince of Egypt'' with $11.5 million
at 3,202 theaters, followed by the seventh weekend of Disney and
Pixar's ``A Bug's Life'' with $10 million at 2,551 locations and
Disney's second weekend of ``Mighty Joe Young'' with $8.7 million
at 2,544 screens. ``A Bug's Life'' has passed $137 million and
could add $25 million more.
</P>
<P>
   Miramax's second weekend of ``The Faculty'' finished seventh
with $7.5 million at 2,365 theaters, followed by Disney's seventh
weekend of ``Enemy of the State'' with $5 million at 1,539 sites to
go past $97 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``Enemy'' will soon become the 13th movie released in 1998 to
top $100 million, and ``Patch Adams'' is a certainty to join that
club. ``You've Got Mail'' and ``Stepmom'' also rate as strong
possibilities.
</P>
<P>
   Rounding out the top 10 were Paramount's fourth weekend of
``Star Trek: Insurrection'' with $4.8 million at 2,516 screens and
Warner's fourth weekend of ``Jack Frost'' with $3.1 million at
2,135 theaters. Final figures, due out today, may replace ``Jack
Frost'' with Miramax's critical sensation ``Shakespeare in Love''
with an impressive $3 million at only 299 sites.
</P>
<P>
   Two milestones were reached during the weekend: Paramount's
seventh weekend of ``The Rugrats Movie'' grossed $2.8 million at
2,002 theaters to top $89 million and beat DreamWorks' ``Antz'' as
the highest-grossing non-Disney animated film; and Disney's ninth
weekend of ``The Waterboy'' took in $2.3 million at 1,142 screens
to become the 59th film to go past $150 million in domestic
grosses.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a great mix of films right now, and people still want
to see these movies,'' Bucksbaum said. ``I think they'll have great
legs in January.''
</P>
<P>
   Rockwell agreed, saying, ``I think the month could match the
levels in January 1998, even though that's when the `Titanic'
frenzy took hold.''

KINGS' MURRAY OUT 8-10 WEEKS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROGER PHILLIPS  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ A magnetic-resonance imaging examination on
the right knee of right wing Glen Murray revealed a torn medial
collateral ligament, and as a result, the Kings will be without
their best all-around forward for 8-10 weeks, the team announced
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The 26-year-old Murray _ second on the Kings in goals, assists
and points to Luc Robitaille and a strong component on the
power-play and penalty-killing units _ was injured in the first
period of Saturday night's 4-2 victory over the Colorado Avalanche.
</P>
<P>
   Murray, who has 15 goals and 28 points, was injured when he
landed awkwardly after a clean check into the boards by Colorado
defenseman Aaron Miller. He is expected to be placed on the
injured-reserve list today but is not expected to need surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Murray's injury is the latest in a season full of serious
injuries to primary Kings players. Defenseman Rob Blake missed 15
games with a broken foot, No.1 center Jozef Stumpel was sidelined
sporadically with hip and ankle injuries for the season's first two
months, and goalies Stephane Fiset and Jamie Storr both have
battled groin strains.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, defenseman Doug Bodger missed a month with a
broken wrist and now is sidelined with a cervical strain and a
bruised shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings also have been without winger Russ Courtnall (broken
ankle) for more than a month, and wingers Sandy Moger (back strain)
and Eric Lacroix (broken sternum) are close to returning after
extended absences because of their injuries. Winger Steve McKenna
is scheduled to undergo abdominal surgery today.
</P>
<P>
   Murray had been one of the Kings' most durable players,
appearing in 128 of 129 games since his acquisition from Pittsburgh
for Ed Olczyk in 1997. He missed one game last season because of
the flu, and hadn't missed a game because of injury since he was
with the Penguins in 1995-96.

   SAN FRANCISCO _ While neither of the coaches involved in
Sunday's game would discuss their respective futures, Green Bay
Packers defensive end Reggie White held firm to his contention that
his NFL career is over.
</P>
<P>
   ``We put too much into this game for it not to hurt and guys
like Brett Favre already are saying to me, 'Reggie, you cannot go
out like this,' `` said the NFL's all-time sack leader following
San Francisco's 30-27 victory. ``But I'd like to think this game
won't diminish what I accomplished. It's time to move on now and do
the Lord's work. If I could do this all again, I would in a minute.
But this is it.''
</P>
<P>
   After tying for the league lead in sacks in '98, White was
rendered invisible on Sunday by San Francisco offensive right
tackle Kirk Scrafford. He finished with two tackles, both coming in
the fourth quarter, and got little pressure on Steve Young. In some
of the blocking schemes designed by Niners offensive line coach
Bobb McKittrick, the feisty Scrafford got some help from fullback
Marc Edwards, but not often.
</P>
<P>
   Haley's back
</P>
<P>
   Veteran defensive end Charles Haley, signed by the 49ers on
Saturday after two years of retirement, had two assisted tackles
and a pass defensed. Haley, 37, logged about 20 snaps and played
extensively on Green Bay's final offensive possession when the
Niners needed pressure on Favre. Unofficially, Haley had two
quarterback hurries. ``Obviously, I am sucking wind right now,''
Haley said. ``I'm nowhere near game shape. But I only do one thing
anyway, rush the quarterback, and I've still got some moves.''
Because of so many injuries, the 49ers rotated defensive linemen
all day. Right end Chris Doleman, playing with a torn pectoral
muscle, lined up on the left side. Left end Roy Barker, who hasn't
practiced in 2-1/2 months because of a balky knee, played the right
side. Former Green Bay starter Gabe Wilkins, who had been playing
tackle since the season-ending injury to Bryant Young, lined up all
over.
</P>
<P>
   Old rivals
</P>
<P>
   Tailbacks Dorsey Levens of Georgia Tech and Garrison Hearst of
Georgia both had very strong performances. Levens had 27 of the
Packers' 28 rushing attempts and finished with 121 yards. He also
had a team-high six receptions for 37 yards. Hearst carried 22
times for the 49ers and rang up 128 yards. He added 15 yards on
three catches. ``My men went out and knocked people down for me,''
said Hearst, who left the field late in the game with leg cramps.
``The line was tremendous.'' Hearst on several occasions easily got
to the outside on the Green Bay defense. His 128 yards represent
the second-best postseason rushing performance in franchise
history. Roger Craig had 135 yards in '89.
</P>
<P>
   Light serving of Rice
</P>
<P>
   Niners wideout Jerry Rice finished with just one catch for 6
yards and Young threw to him only four times all day. Unlike his
past tantrums at not getting the ball enough, Rice was gracious in
the locker room. ``I'm happy for Terrell Owens,'' said Rice. ``The
catch he made will be a signature play in his career.''
</P>
<P>
   Etc.
</P>
<P>
   Green Bay coach Mike Holmgren now has a 21-day window in which
he can field job offers from other teams. ``I've still got to play
quarterback if he goes, but I hope to hell Mike sticks around,''
Favre said. . . . Cornerback Marquez Pope, who has missed much of
the season with a back injury, started for the 49ers. . . . San
Francisco left guard Ray Brown played much of the game with a
concussion and bruised forearm. . . . Green Bay wideout Antonio
Freeman had two touchdown catches and absolutely froze Darnell
Walker with a move that led to the second score, which put the
Packers ahead 27-23 with just under two minutes to play.

 &HT;    Astronomers star in big Austin event
 &HT;    By Dick Stanley
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _Get ready, Austin, for the superbowl of
astronomy.
</P>
<P>
   Starting Tuesday, more than 1,700 professional astronomers from
the United States, Mexico, Canada and Europe will fill the Austin
Convention Center through Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Among the big ideas up for discussion by these international
members of the American Astronomical Society is a curious
acceleration of the universe's ongoing expansion, which the journal
Science named the scientific discovery of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Spectacular new photographs of the universe by the Hubble Space
Telescope also are on the meeting's agenda, as are some newly
discovered entries in the celestial zoo, all carefully being kept
secret until their scheduled public release by some of the 100
science journalists expected to attend.
</P>
<P>
   But, for the most part, members of the society will spend the
week getting reacquainted with colleagues they often exchange
e-mail with but seldom see, attending 1,000 scientific
presentations, and interviewing employment-seeking graduate
students for whom the society's national meetings are mini-job
fairs.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, this national meeting, the first in Austin by the
astronomical society since 1988, is not open to the public, and no
public events are planned.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a professional meeting and the members pay the cost to
put it on,'' said Anita Cochran, a University of Texas research
astronomer, who is the meeting's official chairperson. ``Most of
what's going on wouldn't be interesting to the public because it's
very technical. There will be some people attending sessions all
day long. It's pretty intense.''
</P>
<P>
   Even the least astronomically informed layman, however, would
appreciate the musical comedy entertainment Cochran has booked for
Friday night's farewell banquet: The Austin Lounge Lizards.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love them,'' Cochran said. ``A lot of people aren't going to
know what to make of them. But everyone in the (UT astronomy)
department said, `Wow, that's great.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the society's scientists, who spend their lives worrying
about what's going on in galaxies far, far away, are a staid and
serious bunch.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, tentative plans the society made several years ago
to meet in Las Vegas fell through when prospective hotels announced
they would charge higher-than-usual prices. The hotels said there
was no other way for them to make money since their research had
found that most astronomers don't drink or gamble.
</P>
<P>
   Austin caterers, who normally provide one bartender for every
100 guests at events, figured the society would need about 17
bartenders for its 1,700 guests at the meeting's opening reception
Tuesday night. Cochran told them to figure on no more than four
bartenders.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a party-hat crowd,'' Cochran said. ``Most of them,
anyway. A large number will be looking for jobs and trying to
showcase themselves, so they won't do anything foolish.''
</P>
<P>
   Steve Maran, the society's astronomer-press officer, agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our scientists get high on the universe,'' Maran said. ``They
don't need artificial stimulants.''
</P>
<P>
   UT President Larry Faulkner is scheduled to welcome the
scientists Wednesday morning at the meeting's official opening, but
some attendees will have to start making themselves at home in
Central Texas earlier.
</P>
<P>
   On the meeting's schedule for Tuesday, for instance, is a bus
trip to Waco to see how Raytheon Corp. is coming along on refitting
a Boeing 747 jetliner to carry a German 2.5 meter research
telescope.
</P>
<P>
   This aerial observatory, dubbed SOFIA, for Stratospheric
Observatory for Infrared Astronomy, will make regular research
flights into the stratosphere, about 41,000 feet high, to gather
information from infrared wavelengths from stars and other objects.
Infrared wavelengths are invisible to ground telescopes because
they are absorbed by atmospheric moisture below 40,000 feet.
</P>
<P>
   SOFIA is the replacement for the Kuiper Airborne Observatory of
the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, whose adventures
millions of schoolchildren have followed on television and the
World Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
   UT lost a 1996 bid to manage SOFIA to the Universities Space
Research Association, a consortium of 80 American universities _ in
which UT plays a minor role _ which will keep the 747 at the
Kuiper's old base near San Francisco.
</P>

meeting this week in Austin, see http://www.aas.org/.

TAILGATER MAKES PALS WITH FOOD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL GOODYKOONTZ  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   When you Tennessee and Florida State fans whip out a card table
in a parking lot of Sun Devil Stadium before today's Fiesta Bowl
and pile it high with sandwiches and chips and six packs, you'll
probably think all you're doing is tailgating.
</P>
<P>
   The way Joe Cahn sees it, you're selling yourself short. A
full-time professional tailgater (I'll explain momentarily), Cahn
sees the pre-game ritual as nothing less than a higher calling.
</P>
<P>
   ``I call it the most-ideal neighborhood,'' he said. ``It's the
utopia of neighborhoods. You're not judged by religion, politics,
race. You're judged on one criterion _ what color jersey you're
wearing.''
</P>
<P>
   If Cahn sounds a little over-the-top about tailgating, that's
because he is. Ask him a question about it and he's likely to
answer with a stack of superlatives, piling one atop the other as
if he were building a Dagwood sandwich. Which he could no doubt do.
</P>
<P>
   A professional chef and the former owner of a New Orleans
cooking school, Cahn gave it up a few years ago, bought a motor
home and decided to travel the country _ with a tasty twist.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see travel through food,'' he said last week from New
Orleans, shortly before driving to Tempe for the big game. ``When
we talk about food, we open up to everybody. It's the common
denominator. If you understand a community's food, you really
understand that community. People are fiercely proud of their
food.''
</P>
<P>
   You won't find that pride in restaurants, he figured, so he took
a different approach. He wanted to eat in people's homes. Any
people.
</P>
<P>
   ``I started knocking on doors around dinner time _ `Excuse me,
can I eat with you?' '' he said. ``I wasn't received that well.''
</P>
<P>
   There's a surprise. So he modified his plans and three years ago
decided to tailgate at every NFL stadium. The next year, he went to
college and pro games. This year, Kentucky Fried Chicken came
calling, and asked him to help pick the Top 10 Tailgating Colleges.
(Penn State won; Tennessee finished ninth and Florida State tied
for 10th, with Navy.)
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, traveling around as much as he does, Cahn has picked
up some tall tailgating tales. For instance, there was the Ohio
State fan who had a deed (signed by Woody Hayes) to his parking-lot
space, where he had parked since 1961. Two years ago he had a heart
attack. Then . . . perhaps you can guess where this is leading.
</P>
<P>
   ``While recuperating, he had an ambulance bring him to his
tailgate party,'' Cahn said. ``He sat for the party. Then they took
him back to the hospital.''
</P>
<P>
   There is, of course, the question of what really constitutes
tailgating.
</P>
<P>
   ``To some people it is a six-pack of beer and some chips and
some dip,'' Cahn said. ``To some people it is taking an elaborate
grill and putting china on the table. Some people have a string
quartet playing while a butler serves their meal.''
</P>
<P>
   Aw, come on. Where?
</P>
<P>
   ``The University of Southern California.''
</P>
<P>
   Ha. Figures.
</P>
<P>
   Cahn recommends something a little less elaborate for Vols and
Seminoles tailgaters today. It is, after all, an away game for
both.
</P>
<P>
   ``Keep it simple,'' he said. ``Wear your team colors, fly your
flags, decorate. Come early, get a good spot. That's important.
Have a big sign that everyone is welcome. All you need is good
friends, some good food. Meet people. Go around and talk to people.
Make new friends.''
</P>
<P>
   Cahn will be there, naturally, in his motor home. Best seat in
the house, as far as he's concerned.
</P>
<P>
   ``For all the corporate goings-on at the Fiesta Bowl, everyone
has it in their power to have their own private suite,'' he said,
``and that's out in the parking lot. Tailgating is everyman's
luxury suite.''
</P>
<P>
   I like it. Tell you what, I'll bring the pickles. &QL;

IT'S STRENGTH VS. STRENGTH  
 VOLS' OFFENSE, SEMINOLES' DEFENSE 
</HEADLINE>
 ST-DEFENSE-AZR   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PEDRO GOMEZ  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Tennessee's runners managed to average an eye-opening 211 yards
during their 12 victories this season. Florida State's defense
allowed an average of just 79 yards per game this season.
</P>
<P>
   Which will have the advantage during tonight's Fiesta Bowl?
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee's leading rusher, Travis Henry, gained 970 yards. In
this day of 2,000-yard rushers, Henry's numbers may not leap out.
But he started just four games and was responsible for five of the
nine 100-yard-games by Tennessee running backs. (Injured Jamal
Lewis had three in four starts, and backup Travis Stephens had
another.) And Henry's 5.5 yards per carry average definitely has
caught the attention of Florida State's defensive coaches.
</P>
<P>
   But the Volunteers have run up against few defenses capable of
matching Florida State's team speed. That speed will be the
Seminoles' main asset in trying to neutralize Tennessee's ground
game.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're such great athletes,'' said Tennessee's
All-Southeastern Conference left tackle Chad Clifton. ``They've got
speed, size, strength. They get great pad leverage. They do not
stay blocked. Our motto is: Block 'em twice.''
</P>
<P>
   The Volunteers have been transformed from the Peyton Manning
passing attack into a run-first, pass-later attack under Tee
Martin's direction. They outrushed 10 of their 12 opponents in
reaching the national championship game.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's been our strength the whole year,'' Clifton said.
``It's no secret: For us to have success, we've got to run the
ball. That's a source of pride for us. When we lost our No. 1
running back (Lewis), we took it on ourselves as a challenge to
make sure the holes were there to run through and there would be no
drop-off.''
</P>
<P>
   Another factor is Martin's scrambling ability. In many ways, it
was easier to plan a defensive strategy against Manning and his
NFL-style offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I was a defensive coordinator, I would think it would be
tough with the receivers we have running man-to-man routes that I
could just take off and run 40 or 50 yards,'' Martin said. ``Peyton
had his way of playing, and I have mine. We're both different.''
</P>
<P>
   But no matter how Tennessee chooses to attack, it will have its
work cut out for it. Florida State ranks No. 1 nationally in total
defense (214.8 yards per game), second against the run, first in
pass-efficiency defense, and second in points allowed (11.5 per
game). North Carolina State, which scored 24 in the second week of
the season, was the only opponent to score more than 14 against the
Seminoles.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have great, physical runners,'' Florida State defensive
end Tony Bryant said. ``It's hard to simulate what those can do in
games during our practices. Every game presents a new challenge,
and you always have to adjust to whatever style the other team has.
We've shown the ability to adjust pretty well.''
</P>
<P>
   The toughest part for the Volunteers may be running wide against
Florida State's ultra-quick defenders. That leaves them to try to
pound the Seminoles inside, behind an offensive line that averages
304 pounds per man.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody ever said it was going to be easy,'' said Tennessee
fullback Shawn Bryson. ``They do have fast guys at nearly every
position. But so do we. I'm looking at two very good teams playing
each other, with each doing good things.''

VOLS GO MAN TO MAN TO ATTACK WARRICK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PEDRO GOMEZ  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The list of defensive backs who have been trashed by Florida
State wide receiver Peter Warrick is a long one, filled with some
impressive names.
</P>
<P>
   Warrick badly wants to add the names of Steve Johnson and Dwayne
Goodrich, the Tennessee cornerbacks who will draw the assignment of
trying to stop the player considered the most dangerous receiving
threat in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson and Goodrich say they are ready for the challenge.
Tennessee will not do anything different for tonight's Fiesta Bowl
than it did in winning all 12 of its regular-season games.
</P>
<P>
   The Volunteers will place Johnson and Goodrich in man-to-man
coverage against the Seminoles' wide receivers, which include
Warrick and the tandem of Ron Dugans and Laveranues Coles.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll go with what we did all year,'' said Johnson, a senior.
``Our coaches are confident to put us out there on an island with
those guys.''
</P>
<P>
   The Volunteers will attempt to become only the second school to
play a man-to-man against Warrick, who caught 61 passes for 1,232
yards and scored 12 touchdowns. The only other school to do so,
North Carolina, never had a chance against the Seminoles, losing in
Chapel Hill, N.C., 39-13.
</P>
<P>
   Warrick, defended by Dre Bly that afternoon, caught only three
passes but burned the Tar Heels for 125 yards, including a 56-yard
touchdown. Goodrich has watched that game's videotape five times,
learning a bit more each time, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of solely playing up on the line of scrimmage, a few
yards in front of Warrick and trying to knock him out of his pass
routes by bumping him, Goodrich believes a cornerback must also
drop back a few yards and simply try to remain with Warrick.
</P>
<P>
   ``What Dre did was wrong,'' said Goodrich, a junior with nine
career interceptions. ``You have to mix it up if you're going to
play Warrick man-to-man. He only played the bump. Once Peter knows
what kind of coverage you're giving him, he knows how to get by
you. That's where I'll be different.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem with trying to bump Warrick at the line of scrimmage
is the possibility of missing him.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they stick me man-to-man, it really motivates me,''
Warrick said. ``I had a great game against Dre because I was
especially focused. I know they'll come up and press me at the
line. But if they miss, it's all over.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is exactly what Florida State will be hoping for and
Tennessee defending against.
</P>
<P>
   Seminoles cornerback Dexter Jackson believes he has come up with
a perfect defense to stop Warrick.
</P>
<P>
   ``Peter is the very best receiver in the country,'' Jackson
said. ``The only way I can think of to stop him is to triple-team
him. I honestly think that might work. I feel for anyone who has to
go against him.'' &QL;

FIRE FORECASTERS GET SMOKED OUT IN CUTBACKS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Ron Hamilton isn't a circus performer, but he
does breathe fire for a living.
</P>
<P>
   But like the famous circus performers the Flying Wallendas,
Hamilton might soon become a thing of the past.
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton is a professional fire-weather forecaster -- and thus a
member of a popular but dying breed.
</P>
<P>
   Obsessed with wind speeds and humidity charts, willing to camp
out on the fire lines to help combat dangerous blazes, these
forecasters are popular with fire departments for providing a
steady stream of relevant weather data.
</P>
<P>
   But in a controversial move, the National Weather Service is
phasing out these jobs and replacing them with nonspecialty
positions. The same person who spends one day forecasting fire
conditions might spend the next working on meteorology or marine
forecasts.
</P>
<P>
   Weather service officials said the changes, scheduled to take
place over the next several years, will make the agency more
efficient. But the proposal is getting a hostile reaction from
agencies ranging from local fire departments to the U.S. Forest
Service.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're beginning to compromise firefighter safety, and we do
not want to do that,'' said George Ewan, the U.S. Forest Service's
acting assistant director for Southern California.
</P>
<P>
   During Sunday's blaze near suburban Porter Ranch in the San
Fernando Valley area northwest of downtown Los Angeles,
firefighters had to make due with a four-day-old fire-weather
forecast, said Brian Humphrey, spokesman for the Los Angeles city
Fire Department. He speculated the lack of updated reports was due
to the holiday, rather than staffing changes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The National Weather Service did give reports, but they were
not fire-specific,'' he said. ``We were scrambling.''
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton said he also worries about jeopardizing what he labels
a ``buddy-buddy-type'' bond between firefighters and forecasters.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you work with (firefighters) every day and you know them
on a first-name basis, they really believe what you have to say,''
said Hamilton, 56, who has been a fire-weather forecaster for 14
years. ``They trust you because they've worked with you before.''
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton is one of six such forecasters in California -- three
based in Riverside, the other three in Redding. Twice a day, they
provide fire departments across the state with information about
wind direction, fuel moisture, dew-point temperature and other
relevant data -- all tailored to specific geographical regions.
</P>
<P>
   And on severe fires, forecasters have been known to rush to the
scene, laptop computer and sleeping bag in tow, to help gather
site-specific weather data.
</P>
<P>
   Some fire departments worry about losing a vital source of
information. Humphrey calls the forecasters ``the keystone in the
prediction as well as deployment and response to major fire
incidents.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be unfathomable how we could proceed in fire season
without adequate scientific detail,'' Humphrey said.
</P>
<P>
   Weather service officials insist the changes will not have a
major impact on the basic services. Fire departments will receive
the same daily reports, for instance. What's more, since each of
the agency's forecasters will be trained in fire-weather analysis,
more trained people will be available in emergency situations, they
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going more and more toward this team approach, rather
than you have one lone person with the weight of the whole forecast
on them,'' said Paul Stokols, a National Weather Service program
manager in Silver Springs, Md.
</P>
<P>
   No one is quite sure when the new changes will occur. Estimates
range from a year to three or four years before the transition is
complete.
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton also predicted that the new forecasters would be less
willing to rush to a fire scene because they'd have too many other
responsibilities.
</P>
<P>
   Carl Gorski, fire-weather program manager for the National
Weather Service's Western region, called such issues a concern, but
not a major one.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can free up more resources as we have more professionals
covering the different shifts,'' he said. ``Those guys can hop
right in.''

   Florida State defensive coordinator Mickey Andrews said walk-on
brothers Billy and Bobby Rhodes were players who wouldn't be
denied, despite their physical limitations. They are in the mold of
Cardinals defensive end Andre Wadsworth, who went from walk-on to
the No. 3 pick of the NFL draft.
</P>
<P>
   Billy, a senior, is a second-team defensive lineman. Bobby, a
junior, is a backup at outside linebacker.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do all that big recruiting, and sometimes you've got
players who want to be a part of it so bad they'll listen to you,
they'll do what you ask them to do, and their heart is big enough
that they become players,'' Andrews said. ``That's exactly what
happened with Billy and Bobby Rhodes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wouldn't be the team we are without guys like them, or
Andre Wadsworth, and a lot of guys in past years who have played
that role.'' &QL; 
Take that &QL; 
Bowden was recalling a tale when he and then-Tennessee assistant
coach Phillip Fulmer were on a podium together at a college
football function, and Bowden had the microphone moments before
Fulmer was to speak.
</P>
<P>
   ``I started to introduce Phil, and just before I gave him the
mike, I said, `Alabama, Alabama, Alabama,' '' said Bowden,
referring to a seven-game losing streak the Volunteers had against
the Crimson Tide from 1986 to 1992. ``He grabbed the microphone and
said, `Miami, Miami, Miami.' ''
</P>
<P>
   The Hurricanes routinely kept Florida State from winning a
national championship throughout the 1980s, beating the Seminoles
seven of nine times from 1980 to '88.
</P>
<P>
   ``People ask me all the time why I always had one loss in the
'80s,'' Bowden said. ``I tell 'em it's because I played Miami every
year. In the '90s, it's been Florida. We're the only school that
plays both Miami and Florida. I'd like to see what other schools
would do playing both of them every year.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
Familiar situation &QL; 
Florida State will play today with a backup quarterback, Marcus
Outzen, in the No. 1 spot. It's not an unfamiliar situation for
Bowden.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've played Arizona State twice here during the regular
season (1983 and '84), and in both games our first-team quarterback
got knocked out. We ended up with our second-team quarterbacks and
won.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
No name, no problem &QL; 
Florida State is the nation's top-rated defense, but none of its
defenders stands out over the rest. Linebacker Lamont Green is OK
with that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would rather be here than at another bowl where they say `we
have five All-Americans,' but they're playing in the Citrus Bowl,''
Green said. ``I'd rather be here with a no-name defense.'' &QL;

   &UR; INTERNATIONAL _ (Moved in ``i'' category)  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   BRITAIN-EURO (London) _ Holding back on the brink as it has at
every turn towards European integration, Britain observed the birth
of the euro single currency as a nation apart this weekend, its
leaders mute even as the banks that power the City of London
financial district prepared to trade the new money by the
trillions. By Alan Cowell.
</P>
<P>
   U.S.-EURO (Washington) _ The American policy view of the Euro.

</P>
<P>
   INDIA-AIDS (Calcutta, India) _ The government plans to use a
project that has distributed condoms among sex workers in Calcutta
as a model for all of India, hoping to keep the rate of HIV
infection relatively low in a country of almost a billion people.
By Celia S. Dugger.
</P>
<P>
   CAMBODIA-TOXICWASTE (Sihanoukville) _ A toxic waste dump
continues to arouse international concern and cause local panic. By
Seth Mydans.
</P>
<P>
   KOREA-SPY-POLITICS (Tokyo) _ Charges that the nation's spy
agency has been snooping on members of the National Assembly has
created a furor. By Nicholas D. Kristof.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   MEXICO-PRICEHIKES (Mexico City) _ In a move that has sparked
concern among millions of families, the Mexican government has
ended decades-old corn subsidies and price controls on tortillas, a
staple that is as central to the Mexican diet _ particularly among
the poor _ as bread to Americans and rice to the Chinese. The
measure, government officials said, is part of an effort by Mexican
President Ernesto Zedillo to reduce government spending. Last year,
officials said, tortilla subsidies cost the government some $1
billion.

   &UR; NATIONAL _ GENERAL (Moved in ``a'' category) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   NY-CANCER-COMPETE (New York) _ Cancer is hot in New York, and,
across the city, the major medical centers are aggressively
attempting to nibble away at Memorial Sloan-Kettering's market
share. (Sloan-Kettering was always the place to go for cancer
treatment in New York, because of its prestigious doctors, esteemed
reputation for clinical research and the promising drugs trials it
conducts.) While the concentration on cancer is a nationwide
phenomenon, experts say the new competition is particularly fevered
in New York, where there are already more centers that have the
official designation of the National Cancer Institute _ and its
funding _ than in most other regions.
</P>
<P>
   ST.CROIX-CASINO (St. Croix, U.S.V.I.) _ St. Croix's first casino
is scheduled to open here this fall. In a region battered by four
major hurricanes in the last decade, casinos are seen as a catalyst
to help bring back the economic prosperity that all but vanished in
September 1989, when Hurricane Hugo left 90 percent of the
buildings damaged and more than 20,000 people homeless. By Mireya
Navarro.

   CLINTON-HEALTHCARE _ President Clinton on Monday will announce a
$6-billion package of tax and budget proposals to provide long-term
health care to people who have serious chronic illnesses or
disabilities. By Robert Pear.
</P>
<P>
   IMPEACH-ASSESS _ Since nobody except perhaps Rep. Tom DeLay of
Texas, the House majority whip, appears to believe that the Senate
might really vote to convict President Clinton and remove him from
office, the argument goes, why not get it over with quickly? Some
quick resolution, including a censure, seems to be the goal Trent
Lott and Tom Daschle, the Senate leaders, are pursuing with many
other senators. But there is a case for a trial. It is heard most
often from the president's critics in Congress who insist that when
the Constitution says, ``The Senate shall have the sole power to
try all impeachments,'' it offers no discretion. By Adam Clymer.

   1999-ECON (Undated) _ Most economists say that 1999 is going to
look the way they thought 1998 would look. Growth is supposed to
slow sharply, profits to shrink, inflation to creep up,
unemployment to edge up a bit. Sure, they may be wrong. But that is
exactly the kind of soft landing that Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan
and other central bankers have been hoping for. By Sylvia Nasar.

   1999-EURO (Frankfurt, Germany) _ Now that the euro is here,
almost no one worries whether it can establish its credibility as a
strong currency in world markets. The big issue is whether the euro
will be a bit too strong, so highly valued that it hinders European
growth by making exports more expensive. By Edmund L. Andrews.

   FBN-ANDERSON-PARCELLS (Hempstead, N.Y.) _ For a pro football
coach, the Super Bowl playoffs are the test tubes of his career.
It's where a compelling coach separates himself from the merely
competent, where he discovers who he is and what his team is, where
he learns how to win because he has learned why he lost. It's where
Bill Parcells will lead the Jets against the Jacksonville Jaguars
next Sunday in an American Football Conference divisional playoff,
the beginning of what could be his fourth journey to the Super

<P>
   Tonight, Tennessee offensive coordinator Randy Sanders will call
plays for the first time outside his hotel room.
</P>
<P>
   Sanders, who replaced David Cutcliffe when he left the
Volunteers to become Mississippi's head coach, has been practicing
his play calling most of the week while watching tape in his room.
</P>
<P>
   He has tried to simulate game conditions, taking into account
such factors as down and distance, Florida State's tendencies and
the score.
</P>
<P>
   ``I called a lot of good ones last night,'' Sanders said with a
smile Friday. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Who's the boss? &QL; 
 &QL; 
Sanders knows that not all his calls will make it onto the field.
Some speculate that Tennessee Coach Phillip Fulmer will have a big
hand in the play calling anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's vetoed me a number of times in the past, not necessarily
on play calls, but on different decisions,'' Sanders said. ``He's
the head coach and can do whatever he wants to do. If I want to be
at the University of Tennessee, part of my job description is
accept what he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have a problem with that at all. If I was the head
coach, it would be the exact same way.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
Change of allegiance &QL; 
 &QL; 
It's obvious his allegiances have changed, but Tennessee
quarterback Tee Martin admits he was a Florida State fan growing
up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just liked the style of play,'' he said. ``I liked the
coaches, Bobby Bowden being there my whole life. And growing up in
high school, Charlie Ward was the quarterback I kind of modeled
myself after him. He's a good guy off the field as well as on the
field and won a Heisman Trophy.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin said Florida State recruited him a little bit but ``not
very hard.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
Quick hit &QL; 
 &QL; 
Fulmer said a busy schedule has not allowed the Tennessee coaching
staff to make any home recruiting visits while in the Valley, but
they've been keeping track of several players in the area. The
Volunteers made a major recruiting score in the Valley earlier this
decade, landing South Mountain cornerback Terry Fair, a first-round
draft choice of the Detroit Lions last year. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Mystery solved &QL; 
 &QL; 
John Ward, the longtime broadcasting voice of the Tennessee
football team, has come a long way since he tried to pick up a few
bucks as a sportswriter for the now-defunct Knoxville Journal while
attending law school. He didn't become the next Grantland Rice, but
he did solve a mystery concerning the legendary Robert Neyland,
former Volunteers football coach and athletic director.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most everyone here still pronounces it Nay-land,'' he said.
``But it's actually Knee-land. I know that because he told me.''
</P>
<P>
   The day in question was cold and rainy. Ward was happy to be
stuck in the office. But he was on the bottom rung, and the sports
editor barked, ``Ward, go cover the Tennessee practice!''
</P>
<P>
   ``The general was the athletic director then, and I was
terrified of him,'' Ward said. ``He said to me, `Let's go in the
car.' Well, we went into his car, and I'm not gonna ask him if the
weather's nice.
</P>
<P>
   ``So my first question was, `How do you say your name?' I told
him that I had heard people say it both ways. He told me, and
that's where I got it.''
</P>
<P>
   Just as a confirmation, he was making a speech years later and
retold the story. Neyland's widow was sitting at the head table,
and Ward asked, ``Is that correct, Mrs. Knee-land?''
</P>
<P>
   She got up and slapped her knee. &QL;

CHICAGO DIGS OUT, BUT STORM CRIPPLES AIR TRAVEL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs 9th graf to update number of deaths in Midwest) (lb) 
 By DIRK JOHNSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ Pummeled by the most ferocious snowstorm in more than
30 years, this high-stepping city, after being slowed to a crawl,
started to come back to life on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 2 feet of snow blanketed the city, left by a storm so
furious that at times on Saturday street plows sat idle in
futility. By Sunday afternoon, however, after an army of city
workers had scraped and swept with a vengeance, the streets became
passable.
</P>
<P>
   Getting in or out of town by air, however, remained problematic.
O'Hare International Airport, the United States' busiest, and
Midway Airport struggled to get back to normal on Sunday after
virtually shutting down on Saturday. There were still plenty of
canceled flights and long delays for travelers returning from the
holidays. Some 400 people had slept on cots and benches inside the
airport on Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, air travel throughout the eastern half of the nation was
disrupted Sunday, as the snow and ice in the Midwest, coupled with
heavy sleet and rain on Sunday morning in the Northeast as the
storm moved eastward, resulted in hundreds of canceled flights and
thousands of disgruntled passengers.
</P>
<P>
   In the New York area, the storm and the ripple effects from the
Midwest stranded or delayed thousands of travelers at Kennedy, La
Guardia and Newark International airports as airlines scratched or
rescheduled flights and threw out their timetables.
</P>
<P>
   With water a foot deep on the JFK Expressway leading to Kennedy
Airport, traffic was halted for more than two hours at
midafternoon, and witnesses told of chaos as riders abandoned
stalled taxis and cars and, with luggage and children in tow,
streamed like refugees for the terminals a mile or two away.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is extremely frustrating,'' Adena Muchnik, 26, of New
York said as she and her husband, David, hobbled along the
roadside, struggling with three suitcases and two small children in
strollers, trying to catch a 3:45 flight to Australia. It was
already 3:15, and the dream was dying. ``If we don't make the
flight to Melbourne, we might be out of a vacation,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The storm, which barreled up from the Gulf Coast on Friday, also
dumped heavy snow on Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Michigan, Minnesota,
Missouri, Nebraska, Ohio and Wisconsin.
</P>
<P>
   The weather was blamed for at least 28 deaths in the Midwest,
including 10 in Illinois. Many were the result of traffic
accidents. A 130-mile stretch of Interstate 65 in Indiana reopened
Sunday after being closed on Saturday, but many counties in the
state still banned unnecessary travel.
</P>
<P>
   ``The roads were like ice,'' said John Rawlings, who spent the
night with 200 other travelers at a church near Lafayette, Ind.,
after his van slid off I-65. ``The wind just picked it up and put
it in the ditch,'' Rawlings told The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   In the Northeast on Sunday, it was rain that turned highways
across the region into running rivers, downed power lines in parts
of Connecticut, caused 200 accidents on the New York Thruway, and
toppled rainfall records in New York's Central Park, where 2.42
inches eclipsed a 1936 mark for the date by more than an inch, and
in Bridgeport, Conn., which had 2.71 inches.
</P>
<P>
   Harsh as it was, the storm might have been much worse if
temperatures, which hovered in the 40s most of the day, had been 10
or 15 degrees lower, and the precipitation had turned to snow,
weather experts said. A meteorological rule of thumb is that every
inch of rain would have been a foot of snow.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would have been a big snowstorm,'' Todd Miner, a
meteorologist with Pennsylvania State University, said. ``As it
was, all the snow was dumped in the Midwest.''
</P>
<P>
   The 22 inches that was dumped in Chicago was the most in one
storm since 1967. Indeed, for all its reputation for tough winter
weather, the city had not had more than a foot of snow from any one
storm since 1978.
</P>
<P>
   And in a city where where almost everything is viewed through
the prism of politics, the storm prompted plenty of parlor talk
about the infamous snowstorm of 1979, a mess that contributed
mightily to Jane Byrne's upset victory of the incumbent mayor,
Michael Bilandic. Bilandic had been regarded by voters as being
indifferent to the suffering of Chicagoans, in particular
neglecting black neighborhoods on the South Side.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Richard M. Daley, running for re-election this year
against Rep. Bobby Rush, made himself highly visible during this
storm, casting himself in news conferences as a general rallying
the troops.
</P>
<P>
   ``This task will be enormous,'' said Daley. ``Please be
patient.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The storm followed a remarkable stretch of weather in Chicago
during the last months of 1998, mild temperatures, brilliant
sunshine and skies that seemed as blue as Lake Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   For now, the blankets of snow have given the city an almost
angelic cast, a look of purity and cleanliness.

   ``Man, it's just beautiful,'' said Tom Amenda, 41, a stock
trader.

<P>
   Amenda and his wife, Mary Shannon, a 38-year-old teacher, had
spent the afternoon shopping, and making snow angels in the yard of
their Wicker Park neighborhood.

Amenda expressed gratitude for nature's good timing.

``you want to have it during an election year.''

VOLS SEEM LIKE A SOLID FAVORITE  
 SO WHY IS VEGAS BETTING ON THE SEMINOLES? 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   Let's see . . . They finished 12-0, beat Florida for the first
time in six years and have held the No. 1 ranking for two months.
</P>
<P>
   And the Tennessee Volunteers are 5{-point underdogs to 11-1
Florida State in Monday's Fiesta Bowl because . . .
</P>
<P>
   ``Beats me,'' said John Avello, director of Bally's race and
sports book in Las Vegas. ``I think they should be favored by a
few.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Tennessee players arrived in the Valley with
confidence, they also came with a chip on their shoulders. Respect
has been slow to come, they say, and the point spread confirms it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't call it insulting, but I would say that we're used
to it,'' linebacker Eric Westmoreland said. ``We're used to being
underdogs, second to everybody else.''
</P>
<P>
   It seems to bother the players more than Coach Phillip Fulmer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been No. 1 in the country (for eight weeks),'' he said.
``I think that's about as much respect as you can get. Everywhere I
go, kids are interested in coming to Tennessee, so we're obviously
pretty hot right now.''
</P>
<P>
   The truth appears to lie somewhere in the middle. The Volunteers
``are'' respected, but it seems to be a tentative regard. Here are
several possibilities for the skepticism:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; The Arkansas victory.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee appeared ready to fall to 8-1 on Nov. 14. The
Razorbacks led the entire game and had possession with less than
two minutes remaining.
</P>
<P>
   But then good fortune, the type that seems to touch teams of
destiny, reached down and swatted the ball out of Arkansas
quarterback Clint Stoerner's hands.
</P>
<P>
   With 1:43 remaining and Arkansas leading, 24-22, Stoerner
stumbled and tried to catch his fall with the ball. It popped out,
Tennessee recovered at the Razorbacks 43-yard line, and five
carries later, Travis Henry scored the game-winning touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought the important thing was to win the game,'' Fulmer
said.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; The recent history.
</P>
<P>
   The Seminoles won a national title in 1993. The Volunteers had a
chance to win over some skeptics last season in the Orange Bowl,
but a 21-point third quarter by Nebraska led to a convincing 42-17
Cornhuskers victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we have as much tradition as any school in the
country, but we haven't been able to win the big game,'' cornerback
Steve Johnson said. ``We went down to the Orange Bowl last year and
played a good first half, but the second half, we stunk it up. So a
lot of people were saying, `Why is Tennessee in this game playing
Nebraska?'
</P>
<P>
   ``This year, after we refocused, we impressed a lot of people as
a hard-working, blue-collar team, and people are starting to take
notice.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; The opponent.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Seminoles have a blemish on their record, a 24-7
loss to North Carolina State, it came early in the season. FSU
teams tend to peak at the right time.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, despite playing the fourth-toughest schedule in
the country, the Seminoles won many of their games convincingly.
Plus, their defense is ranked No. 1 in the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that's the main reason people are picking Florida
State, and I wouldn't disagree with that,'' Avello said. ``But I
would also say Florida State's offense is weaker than Tennessee's,
and that alone is enough of a reason for me to like (the
Volunteers).''
</P>
<P>
   Few seem to be bothered that Seminoles quarterback Marcus Outzen
is starting only his third game.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; The coaches.
</P>
<P>
   Both are among the best in the business.
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Bowden's Seminoles have finished in the Associated Press'
Top Four for 11 consecutive seasons. He has a 12-1 bowl record over
the last 13 years, including a record 11 straight victories.
</P>
<P>
   Fulmer has the best winning percentage among active coaches and
is 44-5 since 1995, the most victories over a four-year span in
school history.
</P>
<P>
   ``Perhaps my personality hasn't lent itself to being something
that brings attention to the program,'' Fulmer said. ``I'm not
Bobby Bowden. I also haven't been in it as long as he's been in it,
either.''
</P>
<P>
   In Johnson's mind, there's only one way to correct people's
perception.
</P>
<P>
   ``To actually get the national respect everybody around here
wants,'' he said, ``we're going to have to beat a nationally ranked
team and well-respected team like Florida State. It's that
simple.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This,'' said defensive tackle Darwin Walker, ``is our
chance.'' &QL;

 PAIR SHARE MOTHERS' ILLNESSES

 c.1999 The Arizona Republic

<P>
   The worry is gone from his face, replaced by relief and joy.
Now, for the first time in his Florida State career, senior free
safety Dexter Jackson can focus only on a football game. Which, in
this case, happens to be for the national championship.
</P>
<P>
   Tonight, the second-ranked Seminoles meet top-ranked Tennessee
in the Tostitos Fiesta Bowl at Sun Devil Stadium. Getting to Tempe
was the goal from the beginning of the season for Florida State.
They wore ``Discipline to Desert'' shirts.
</P>
<P>
   Before today, however, Jackson's thoughts were with his ailing
mother at home in Quincy, Fla. He would put tape on his wrist
before games and write ``Mom'' on it. He'd pray she would receive a
kidney.
</P>
<P>
   After a six-year wait, Lula Lee was given the transplant on
Thanksgiving Day.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the greatest time in my life,'' Jackson said. ``Right
after that, Kansas State and UCLA both lost. We got the trip to the
national championship game. All that's left is a title. That would
be the perfect way to end my senior year.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if that is lost, Jackson has won, knowing his mother is on
her way to recovery. She still has her down days and remains on a
dialysis machine until her new kidney gets stronger. But there is
hope, and that's all Jackson can ask for as he prepares for the
biggest game of his life.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a big burden off my shoulders,'' he said. ``I was always
playing, thinking about my mom and how she's doing back home. I'd
think, `Is she OK? Is she OK?'
</P>
<P>
   ``Since the kidney transplant, she's doing well. The pressure is
off me now. I can just go out and perform.''
</P>
<P>
   So can senior linebacker Lamont Green, who is inspired by
Jackson's story. Green's mother, Emma, received a kidney transplant
five years ago, but it is failing and she has been put on a donor
waiting list.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I'm on the field, I just try to concentrate on
football,'' Green said. ``I know she doesn't want me worrying about
her on the field.''
</P>
<P>
   The two players have formed a special friendship.
</P>
<P>
   ``His mom has had a transplant, and everything worked out
successfully, so that gives me a lot of hope that when my mom goes
in to have hers, everything will be fine,'' Green said.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson and Green talk about their mothers, but they don't dwell
on their problems. They feel it is bizarre that they ended up on
the same top-rated defense with similar situations at home.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mostly, we try to cheer each other up,'' Green said. ``We've
grown a lot closer.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson, an only child whose father died of a heart attack eight
years ago, moved only 30 miles from his home in Quincy, Fla., not
only for the chance to play on a national championship team, but to
make sure he was there for his mother.
</P>
<P>
   Every other day during the season, he would drive from
Tallahassee to Quincy to visit his mom.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it was hard on him,'' Jackson's mother said. ``He'd
keep it to himself. I just told him to do the best that he could
do. The Lord will take care of him.''
</P>
<P>
   With concerns for his mother, Jackson said he never felt he
played to his potential.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was always thinking about her,'' he said. ``She'd say not to
worry, but I'd say, `Mom, it's not that easy. I'll always worry
about you, no matter what.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson said he wanted to give one of his kidneys to his mother,
but his blood type didn't match. Even if it had, Lee said she
wouldn't let her son give up a kidney for her.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wanted to play football, and if he gave it up, I knew he
couldn't do that anymore,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson did other things to help his mother: He excelled on the
field and in the classroom. He is an honor student who is on
schedule to graduate this year with a degree in child psychology.
Last year, he made the All-Atlantic Coast Conference academic team.
</P>
<P>
   This season, he is the Seminoles' second-leading tackler with
69, including 44 solo stops. He has four interceptions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just thank the Lord that she's a strong woman,'' Jackson
said. ``She didn't look at it as a sickness. She looked at is a
part of life. She always told me to keep the faith and don't
question God's call.''
</P>
<P>
   That's what Jackson tells Green now. &QL;

   Tonight, Tennessee offensive coordinator Randy Sanders will call
plays for the first time outside his hotel room.
</P>
<P>
   Sanders, who replaced David Cutcliffe when he left the
Volunteers to become Mississippi's head coach, has been practicing
his play calling most of the week while watching tape in his room.
</P>
<P>
   He has tried to simulate game conditions, taking into account
such factors as down and distance, Florida State's tendencies and
the score.
</P>
<P>
   ``I called a lot of good ones last night,'' Sanders said with a
smile Friday. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Who's the boss? &QL; 
 &QL; 
Sanders knows that not all his calls will make it onto the field.
Some speculate that Tennessee Coach Phillip Fulmer will have a big
hand in the play calling anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's vetoed me a number of times in the past, not necessarily
on play calls, but on different decisions,'' Sanders said. ``He's
the head coach and can do whatever he wants to do. If I want to be
at the University of Tennessee, part of my job description is
accept what he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have a problem with that at all. If I was the head
coach, it would be the exact same way.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
Change of allegiance &QL; 
 &QL; 
It's obvious his allegiances have changed, but Tennessee
quarterback Tee Martin admits he was a Florida State fan growing
up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just liked the style of play,'' he said. ``I liked the
coaches, Bobby Bowden being there my whole life. And growing up in
high school, Charlie Ward was the quarterback I kind of modeled
myself after him. He's a good guy off the field as well as on the
field and won a Heisman Trophy.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin said Florida State recruited him a little bit but ``not
very hard.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
Quick hit &QL; 
 &QL; 
Fulmer said a busy schedule has not allowed the Tennessee coaching
staff to make any home recruiting visits while in the Valley, but
they've been keeping track of several players in the area. The
Volunteers made a major recruiting score in the Valley earlier this
decade, landing South Mountain cornerback Terry Fair, a first-round
draft choice of the Detroit Lions last year. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Mystery solved &QL; 
 &QL; 
John Ward, the longtime broadcasting voice of the Tennessee
football team, has come a long way since he tried to pick up a few
bucks as a sportswriter for the now-defunct Knoxville Journal while
attending law school. He didn't become the next Grantland Rice, but
he did solve a mystery concerning the legendary Robert Neyland,
former Volunteers football coach and athletic director.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most everyone here still pronounces it Nay-land,'' he said.
``But it's actually Knee-land. I know that because he told me.''
</P>
<P>
   The day in question was cold and rainy. Ward was happy to be
stuck in the office. But he was on the bottom rung, and the sports
editor barked, ``Ward, go cover the Tennessee practice!''
</P>
<P>
   ``The general was the athletic director then, and I was
terrified of him,'' Ward said. ``He said to me, `Let's go in the
car.' Well, we went into his car, and I'm not gonna ask him if the
weather's nice.
</P>
<P>
   ``So my first question was, `How do you say your name?' I told
him that I had heard people say it both ways. He told me, and
that's where I got it.''
</P>
<P>
   Just as a confirmation, he was making a speech years later and
retold the story. Neyland's widow was sitting at the head table,
and Ward asked, ``Is that correct, Mrs. Knee-land?''
</P>
<P>
   She got up and slapped her knee. &QL;

LOS ANGELES: ``Mighty Joe Young'' ($85 million).
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``There was supposed to be a return to fiscal prudence after
`Titanic,' but it was such a hit that people still can't stop
trying to hit home runs,'' Rockwell said. ``I think they're trying
to slow down but it's very tough to generalize.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis, who is working on half a dozen projects including a
``Dolittle'' sequel, says he notices a difference from a few years
ago. ``I think it's gotten tougher to make movies,'' he asserts.
``You see studios canceling projects with big stars because the
economics have not been terrific in the last few years. It makes
for a much more cautious process.''
</P>
<P>
   But making movies remains enormously attractive. Everyone agrees
there were several major winners this year, including:
</P>
<P>
   Animated films. The Walt Disney Co. and DreamWorks SKG each
released two such films with fairly strong results; Paramount spent
a mere $25 million for ``The Rugrats Movie'' and established the
brand as a powerful franchise.
</P>
<P>
   ``We decided the time was right because it had become part of
the pop culture,'' said Albie Hecht, president of the Nickelodeon
cable channel, which airs ``Rugrats.'' ``We felt we could compete
because we had the first animated film that was really contemporary
movie rather than the classic animation look. We're not committed
to a particular style so we don't have to build a huge studio.''
</P>
<P>
   Low-cost comedies such as ``There's Something About Mary,''
``Rush Hour,'' ``The Wedding Singer'' and ``The Waterboy.''
``Mary,'' which cost $25 million, is expected to take in $350
million worldwide for 20th Century Fox, making it the year's most
profitable movie.
</P>
<P>
   Mid-range comedies with star appeal, including ``The Truman
Show,'' ``Dr. Dolittle,'' ``Patch Adams'' and ``You've Got Mail.''
``Moviegoers really looked for lighthearted entertainment this
year,'' Leatherman said. ``They told Hollywood, give me fun that's
not overly contrived.''
</P>
<P>
   New Line Cinema and DreamWorks, which finished well ahead of
Universal despite offering limited slates. New Line continued to
capitalize on niche films; DreamWorks became a player with the
year's second highest grosser and leading Academy Awards contender
in ``Saving Private Ryan.''
</P>
<P>
   Split financing on big-budget films. The strategy enabled
Paramount, among the most cost-conscious of studios, to hold stakes
in ``Titanic,'' ``Saving Private Ryan,'' ``Deep Impact,'' ``A Civil
Action'' and ``Snake Eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   Giant-screen films. ``Everest'' grossed more than $55 million
this year despite never being on more than 62 screens at once.
</P>
<P>
   The foreign market, which now takes in over 60 percent of
worldwide grosses and continues to grow. Eighteen movies topped
$100 million overseas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Episode One: the Phantom Menace.'' Buzz generated by the
trailer for the ``Star Wars'' prequel shows that not even the
record for ``Titanic'' is safe.

MOVIES DO BOFFO BOX OFFICE IN U.S. DURING '98
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DAVE MCNARY  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Hollywood finished 1998 with a flourish, capping
a risk-filled year with a 9 percent rise in its all-important
domestic box office to nearly $7 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Three of the final batch of major films -- ``Stepmom,'' ``You've
Got Mail'' and ``Patch Adams'' -- matched lofty expectations during
the crucial holiday season. The year's last eight weeks saw enough
success from three Disney films (``The Waterboy,'' ``A Bug's
Life,'' ``Enemy of the State'') to cancel out Universal's double
disaster from ``Meet Joe Black'' and ``Babe: Pig in the City.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The holiday season hasn't been great, but it's been very
good,'' said analyst Arthur B. Rockwell, a former studio executive.
``There were no runaway blockbusters but there was a lot of good
product drawing audiences on a continuing basis. It's become harder
than ever to have a blockbuster because the business is so
competitive and the marketplace is far more crowded.''
</P>
<P>
   Cynics may argue that ``Titanic,'' which drew 75 percent of its
$600 million total domestic gross during 1998, was the key factor
in the year-to-year increase. But it accounted for only half the
gain. Even though only one film, Disney's ``Armageddon'' topped
$200 million, 11 others grossed over $100 million and eight more
topped $75 million, reflecting an unprecedented breadth of strong
product.
</P>
<P>
   Overall strength was most evident during the Christmas weekend
when the industry smashed the record for biggest three-day box
office with $148.3 million in gross receipts. Seven films topped
$10 million over the weekend and the year's last seven days were on
track to become the highest-grossing week of all time.
</P>
<P>
   Even Universal Studios, which had suffered through a brutal
hitless stretch of 20 films, found a winner as ``Patch Adams'' led
the box office with a $25.3 million opening, followed by more than
$20 million on the year's last four days. Robert Bucksbaum,
president of Reel Source Inc., projected a $160 million final
gross.
</P>
<P>
   What was most impressive about 1998 was that Hollywood managed
to significantly improve its performance for the third year in a
row. Attendance rose 5.4 percent to 1.46 billion tickets as theater
chains replaced outmoded facilities with massive ``megaplexes''
with as many as 30 screens, huge snack bars and stadium seating.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 5,000 more domestic screens -- nearly all of them in
flashy new movie palaces -- have been added in the past four years
to push the current count to 34,500.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel very good about the new theaters, which are leading a
renaissance of moviegoing,'' said Jeff Blake, head of Sony's
distribution arm. ``It's invigorated the business and brought back
some of the adults who weren't that interested in the older
six-plexes. With the new theaters, you can service a lot of
different audiences so we feel better about releasing our more
adult-oriented films wider.''
</P>
<P>
   Russ Leatherman, president of the MovieFone service, agreed.
``Chains are forced into upgrading because competition is so
high,'' he said. ``As studios make more technically sophisticated
movies, there's a need for great places to display them. I'm much
more likely to go to a theater that has nice presentation than one
that has my feet sticking to the floor.''
</P>
<P>
   Many movies now open at more than 2,500 locations, making it
much easier than a few years ago for moviegoers to find a specific
film. The explosion in screens at improved locations means
moviegoers attend more often; in turn, studios are becoming less
likely to save all their best films for the holidays or the early
summer, which had been a huge complaint among exhibitors.
</P>
<P>
   Prime examples of spreading out the schedule were evident
throughout 1998 -- February's ``The Wedding Singer,'' late July's
``There's Something About Mary'' and ``Saving Private Ryan,''
September's ``Rush Hour'' and October's ``Antz.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If you have a good movie, they come,'' said industry veteran
John Davis, producer of ``Dr. Dolittle.'' ``There's really no bad
time to open a film any more.''
</P>
<P>
   Blake said Sony's timing was a key factor in achieving a
third-place finish behind Disney and Paramount in the domestic box
office. He noted the studio placed one major wide release in every
month along with a dozen specialized films.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always a challenge because it's such a crowded market, so
you definitely need a 52-week game plan,'' he said. ``I'd like to
see exhibitors play some of the titles longer, but I'm not upset
when we get a lot of screens for the hot title.''
</P>
<P>
   Blake said part of Sony's success was simply avoiding failure.
``We swung for the fences with `Godzilla,' which grossed $375
million worldwide, and we had lots of singles and doubles, like
`Mask of Zorro' '' he said. ``The key thing is we really didn't
have a big loser.''
</P>
<P>
   That's often the operative philosophy as studios try to keep
costs from soaring further amid actor salaries of $20 million per
movie and the need for never-before-seen special effects. The
average movie cost $53.4 million to produce and $22.2 million to
market in 1997, according to the Motion Picture Association of
America; 1998 numbers will likely be significantly higher.
</P>
<P>
   In response, top studio executives have limited the number of
major releases opening on 2,000 screens to about 140 a year, down
about a dozen from 1997. And they insist they are green-lighting
fewer ``tentpole'' big-budget films with whiz-bang, expensive
special effects.
</P>
<P>
   Still, studios managed to strike out on a lot of big budget
films. In recent months, many movies came into theaters with
questionable potential and eye-grabbing production budgets: ``Meet
Joe Black'' ($90 million), the ``Babe'' sequel ($85 million),
PolyGram's ``What Dreams May Come'' ($85 million), Warner's ``The
Avengers'' ($70 million), MGM's ``Ronin'' ($60 million), Warner's
``Soldier'' ($58 million) and Disney's ``Holy Man'' ($60 million)
and ``Mighty Joe Young'' ($85 million).

SIX-HOUR BLAZE CHARS OVER 400 ACRES IN LOS ANGELES
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- A massive brush fire scorched more than 400 acres
of dry hillsides above suburban Porter Ranch on Sunday, as winds up
to 50 mph whipped 20-foot flames perilously close to homes.
</P>
<P>
   The fire, which started about 11 a.m. in the city's San Fernando
Valley region about 25 miles northwest of downtown Los Angeles,
spread west through the Santa Susana Mountains, creeping within
several yards of homes in the far north portion of Porter Ranch.
</P>
<P>
   ``It burned from the top of the hill to the bottom in about 30
minutes,'' said resident Jerry Colburn, whose back yard abuts the
burn area. ``It kind of jumped around because there were embers
being blown around all over the place.''
</P>
<P>
   The arid, 78-degree air allowed winds of 35 mph to 50 mph to fan
the flames through brush parched by a season of low rainfall.
</P>
<P>
   While 400 to 600 acres burned, no injuries or structure damage
occurred, and the blaze was fully contained at 5 p.m. just east of
the community of Winnetka, said Los Angeles Fire Department
spokesman Brian Humphrey.
</P>
<P>
   But residents spent several anxious hours Sunday afternoon
watching thick brown smoke rise off the charred hillside and
debating whether to leave or stay.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am very worried,'' said Alex Henson, 46, whose home was also
on the front line of the fire.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been here four years and this is the first time we've
had this kind of fire here,'' he said, watching bulldozers clear
dried grass as burning cinders stung his eyes. ``That's why I'm
trying to hang on as long as possible. If worst comes to worst, I
will have to take what I can and run.''
</P>
<P>
   More than 300 firefighters from the city Fire Department and the
Los Angeles and Ventura county fire departments attacked the blaze
on the ground, while five helicopters dropped water on the flames
or scouted out the fire's path, Los Angeles fire Capt. Tim McDonell
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Fire Department did not order evacuations, but Henson and
other residents stood ready to flee if the flames flared out of
control.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a firebreak, and between that and the tile roofs the
fire couldn't get through,'' said Dan Rigney, 45.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it's the kind of thing where you get the baby pictures out
and you get things ready to go just in case,'' said his wife,
Jamie, also 45.
</P>
<P>
   Residents in nearby neighborhoods also prepared for the worst.
</P>
<P>
   ``I put my pictures and clothes in the car,'' said Nenet
Kureghian. ``The deer and rabbits were escaping from the flames and
it became very hot in our house. But there were firetrucks parked
all over in front so I felt pretty safe.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, fire officials were concerned Sunday afternoon that
the fire was not controlled and still posed a potential threat to
nearby neighborhoods. Because of the steep terrain and high winds,
firefighters could not attack it head on, but fought along its
flanks, trying to reduce and contain it.
</P>
<P>
   As firefighters monitored the fire through the Santa Susanna
hillsides, others were stationed in Brown's Canyon and in
neighborhoods below Highway 118 in case the fire took a turn
southward, fire officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to get engine companies at least an hour ahead of
the fire, instead of trying to chase it,'' McDonell said.
</P>
<P>
   Their efforts were successful, and the department pronounced the
fire contained at 5 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Jackie Abkian of Porter Ranch said the flames burned up to her
home, but added that she was confident firefighters would keep them
at bay.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were worried, but those firefighters were right in front of
our house,'' she said. ``They told us that if there was any danger
they would protect us. We trusted them and didn't panic. Now we're
OK. They knew exactly where the fire was heading. Thank God for
them.''

SAN FRANCISCO _ As the ball was snapped and the clock began ticking
down those last eight seconds, Terrell Owens didn't think about
anything at all. He couldn't afford to.
</P>
<P>
   There was so much to weigh him down as he came off the line of
scrimmage and gave Packers strong safety LeRoy Butler a head fake
to the outside, then cut right back over the middle toward the end
zone.
</P>
<P>
   There was his reception and fumble on the opening series of the
game that set up a Packers field goal and early lead. There were
four dropped passes of assorted degrees of difficulty, one that was
a sure third-period touchdown and another on third down just a few
minutes earlier in the fourth quarter that led to the Packers
getting the ball back for their go-ahead score.
</P>
<P>
   So here was another playoff game with their tormentors from
Green Bay and another 49ers season coming down to one play, and
there was the pass from Steve Young headed straight for Edward
Scissorhands.
</P>
<P>
   As the ball zipped through the air like a tracer bullet, the
66,506 partisans in the stands at 3Com Park had every reason to be
more jittery than a Chihuahua inside a paint shaker.
</P>
<P>
   But this time, the only time it really counted, Owens wrapped up
the ball in his arms, took a pair of hammer-on-anvil hits from
safeties Darren Sharper and Pat Terrell, and hung on for the
25-yard touchdown with just three seconds left that gave the Niners
a 30-27 victory that was as shocking for who won it as how.
</P>
<P>
   After all, you wouldn't normally ask Venus de Milo to do the
delicate detail work for the bomb squad.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just happy I caught that ball,'' Owens said. ``I had a
rough day up to that point.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is only like saying downtown Baghdad had a rough month.
</P>
<P>
   For a proud _ sometimes boastful _ franchise whose Super Bowl
roots grow out of Dwight Clark's dramatic reception of Joe
Montana's pass to beat the Dallas Cowboys in the 1981 NFC
Championship Game, this was a bookend clutch payoff in the end zone
at the other end of the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Catch'' _ as Montana-to-Clark is known around here _ at
long last has a cousin.
</P>
<P>
   ``Call it `The Throw,''' Young said with a devilish smile.
</P>
<P>
   ``Call it `Redemption,''' said Owens, breathing a huge sigh of
relief. ``I just knew that I had to make a big play for this team.
All year, I had been making plays, and I didn't want to get into a
big game and choke up. All day long, those balls were bouncing off
my hands and my teammates on the sidelines kept telling me to keep
my head up. I'm just so glad I got that chance to redeem myself.''
</P>
<P>
   It was overdue redemption for the 49ers franchise, which had
been knocked out of the playoffs in each of the three previous
seasons by Green Bay. It's an organization that had been coming
unraveled as owner Ed DeBartolo Jr. lost control of his team
because of legal problems, and president Carmen Policy and Clark,
the director of football operations, quit to work for the expansion
club in Cleveland. Then, they lost their stranglehold on the NFC
West, finishing behind Atlanta in the standings.
</P>
<P>
   It was also personal redemption for Young, who had listened ad
nauseam in the week before the game that he was 0-8 lifetime
against the Packers and was again hearing the whispers that, unlike
the legendary Montana, he could not win the big games.
</P>
<P>
   So finally, Young did. And he did it with Montana's flair and
flourish.
</P>
<P>
   It was a sloppy, ugly game with seven turnovers and many
mistakes. The 49ers never looked streamlined or efficient. But
winning is the best deodorant, and the conclusion left only the
aroma of accomplishment.
</P>
<P>
   After Owens had dropped the critical third-down pass with just
over four minutes left in the game and the Packers drove 89 yards
to go in front 27-23 when Brett Favre lobbed a 15-yard TD to
Antonio Freeman with only 1:56 to go, the Niners quarterback summed
up the situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Plenty of time,'' he said. ``Plenty of time.'' Which is just
what Montana would have said.
</P>
<P>
   Young was as sharp as a sushi chef in completing six of eight
passes and moving the 49ers from their 24 to the Green Bay 25 with
eight seconds on the clock.
</P>
<P>
   The play is called ``All Go'' with four receivers heading for
the end zone. Young took the snap from center Chris Dalman and
tripped on a chunk of sod.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kind of disappeared there for a minute from the defense, and
maybe that helped it all develop,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Packers were settled in a deep zone and amazingly allowed
the middle of the field to open up. Owens made his fake and the
cut. Young made the right read and the throw. Owens held on.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Redemption, for so many.

   &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
TEMPE, Ariz. _ Florida State's Bobby Bowden and Tennessee's Phil
Fulmer are living proof that there is no cut-and-dried way of
reaching the pinnacle of the college football coaching profession.
</P>
<P>
   One of them, Bowden, seems to be the classic cutup, like the
favorite uncle or grandfather who laughs his way through the day
and goes around saying things like, ``I got your nose,'' and,
``Pull my finger.''
</P>
<P>
   The other is the serious, meticulous workaholic, the one who
seems to have the personality of dried fruit and misses by just a
tick whenever he tries a one-liner.
</P>
<P>
   Bowden walks into a ballroom like he has never seen one before _
wide-eyed, curious, dropping his jaw at the sight of the glittery
chandelier overhead and marveling at the flashing lights in his
eyes.
</P>
<P>
   His saunter is right out of Satchel Paige's rules for longevity
_ loose, jangly and never looking back.
</P>
<P>
   He spins stories as if he's whittling on the front porch, not
standing in front of the nation on the verge of carving out another
national championship.
</P>
<P>
   Fulmer walks into a ballroom like he's in the middle of a
leveraged buyout _ purposeful and determined, planning his course
and words carefully. His style is right out of Roberts' Rules of
Order.
</P>
<P>
   When he is asked a question, only occasionally does Fulmer turn
his head to look at the person asking it, instead responding as if
talking to the blankness in the air.
</P>
<P>
   Yet here is Bowden. Here is Fulmer. Separate but equal.
</P>
<P>
   Neither denies that the reputation that follows him is mostly
true.
</P>
<P>
   Fulmer has been known to work 18-hour days and admits, ``I'm not
real flashy.'' However, his players always defend their coach and
say the image shown to the nation goes only as deep as the starched
shirts he wears for the cameras.
</P>
<P>
   Bowden admits he likes to take an occasional nap and arrived at
his eighth consecutive January bowl this week in typical style, as
if walking off the Grayline in Las Vegas, wearing a windsuit,
bifocals and comfortable shoes.
</P>
<P>
   Later, when he was handed a sack of Tostitos and a gift bag,
Bowden thanked the fellow who handed him the gifts and asked, ``Are
you the master of ceremonies?''
</P>
<P>
   The reply: ``No, I'm the mayor of Tempe.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead of awkwardly backtracking over his mistake, Bowden
laughed a giddy laugh and slapped Mayor Neil Giuliano on the back,
saying, ``Oops.''
</P>
<P>
   Bowden is Bowden; Fulmer is Fulmer. They have proved just how
diverse the roads to greatness can be. Neither is right; neither is
wrong. Both are worthy of all the good things ever said about them.
</P>
<P>
   For all the characterizations that have followed these coaches
throughout their different career paths, there remains one huge
similarity. When it's time to play the game, they get it done.
</P>
<P>
   Among active coaches, only Penn State's Joe Paterno has won more
college football games than Bowden's 292. And among active coaches,
no one has a higher winning percentage than Fulmer's .857.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, Bowden is not always as casual about things as he
appears. In the pivotal moments against Florida in the final
regular-season game of the year, he was heard barking into the
headset to offensive coordinator Mark Richt, ``What are we gonna
do, punt them to death? Run that Peter thing!''
</P>
<P>
   Moments later, Richt called a reverse pass by All-American Peter
Warrick, and the ensuing 46-yard touchdown to Ron Dugans sealed the
23-12 win and the Fiesta Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Tonight, Bowden and Fulmer meet.
</P>
<P>
   The pick here is for Bowden's Seminoles to ultimately walk away
with the championship, only because of a defensive line that
refuses to budge, a big play from Warrick and an edge in experience
over Fulmer and his staff that cannot be overestimated.
</P>
<P>
   But the beauty of tonight's game is that it shows just how many
different ways there are to become a champion.
</P>
<P>
   Witness: On the eve of the game, both coaches were asked to
describe the exhilarating feeling they might have with a victory.
</P>
<P>
   Fulmer spoke of the immense sense of satisfaction he would feel,
the culmination of months of work, the realization of goals
achieved.
</P>
<P>
   Asked Bowden: ``What's `exhilarating' mean?''
