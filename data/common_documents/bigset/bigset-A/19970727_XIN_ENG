<HEADLINE> UK Likely to End Ban on Front-Line Roles for Women </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 26 (Xinhua) -- The British government is likely to
put an end to a ban on women serving in front-line army roles in
an effort to ease the recruitment crisis in the country's armed
forces.
</P>
<P>
British Defense Secretary George Robertson was quoted by the
BBC television as saying today that the Ministry of Defense will
undertake a wide-ranging review of women's role in the armed
forces to see whether to abolish the traditional barring of women
from front-line duty.
</P>
<P>
"If a woman wants to do it and is fit enough and it does not
compromise combat effectiveness, then perhaps we should look again
at modern attitudes to these things," he said.
</P>
<P>
Robertson made it clear that he had no objection in principle
to extending the women's role in the army, saying, "We've got to
make sure that the armed forces of this country are seen to be up
to date, to be modern, enlightened and fair. That's why the role
of women is so important."
</P>
<P>
"I think that as many positions should be open to as many
people as possible. What we're obliged to look at is the practical
impact of our policies," he added.

<P>
Chirac expressed France's firm support for Mubarak's initiative
aiming at patching up the disrupted Mideast peace process in the
verbal message, the top French military official said following a
meeting with Mubarak at the Mediterranean port city of Alexandria.
</P>

France considers Egypt's policy very successful in this

<HEADLINE> Hun Sen Meets Chinese Businessmen, Stresses One China Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, July 16 (Xinhua) -- Cambodia resolutely upholds the
"one China" policy and will only develop economic relations with
Taiwan, Cambodian Second Prime Minister Hun Sen said today during
a meeting with some 600 Chinese businessmen in the capital.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister paid tribute to these business
representatives from Chinese inland areas, Hong Kong, Taiwan and
Macao, saying they have made great contributions to the
development of Cambodian economy.
</P>
<P>
Hun Sen said that Cambodia recognizes the government of the
People's Republic of China as the sole legitimate government of
China and Taiwan is but part of China.
</P>
<P>
He pledged that his country will never establish political
relations with Taiwan, saying it is a matter of principle
concerning state sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the closing of Taiwan's trade and cultural office
in Phnom Penh earlier this week, Hun Sen said it is part of
Cambodia's efforts to solve its security and political problems.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he expressed his hope that the move would not affect
normal Taiwanese investment in Cambodian.
</P>
<P>
The interests of Taiwanese businessmen should be protected by
the Chinese Embassy in Cambodia, he added.

<HEADLINE> Ukraine Likely to Have New Cabinet with Old Ministers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Ukrainian Prime Minister Valery
Pustovoitenko announced today a new cabinet will be in place when
the parliament reconvenes on August 28, but chances of seeing many
new faces in the cabinet are slim.
</P>
<P>
"The same people will remain in the same post," said Roman
Zwarycz, director of the Center for Democratic Reform, a Ukrainian
think tank. "They may just be reorganized among different
ministries again."
</P>
<P>
Thanks to vague constitutional guidelines, Ukrainian President
Leonid Kuchma and Pustovoitenko are under no time pressure to form
a new government, nor must they seek the approval of Parliament
for any governmental changes.
</P>
<P>
The Ukrainian constitution gives the president exclusive
authority to accept or reject nominees for ministerial posts that
are submitted by the prime minister. In addition, Pustovoitenko is
at any rate viewed as a Kuchma surrogate unlikely to disagree with
his longtime boss.
</P>
<P>
Pustovoitenko is the first prime minister belonging to a
particular party. His colleagues in the People's Democratic Party
(PDP) acknowledged that they would take an active role in the
appointment of new ministers.
</P>
<P>
"The PDP is conscious of its participation in the formation of
a new cabinet and is ready to take responsibility for all its
representatives there," said PDP First Deputy Chairman Volodymyr
Filenko.
</P>
<P>
Controlling just 21 of the 450 seats in Parliament, the PDP is
ready to support non-PDP members to be nominated by Pustovoitenko,
added Filenko.
</P>
<P>
Recent history shows that the new government will bear a strong
likeness to its predecessors. Most officials in the current
cabinet have served in at least one of the other five governments
Ukraine has had since independence in 1991.
</P>
<P>
Many officials are not likely to shift position at all,
observers say.
</P>
<P>
In particular, the PDP will recommend that its members in the
present government be re-appointed, including Economy Minister
Yury Yekhanurov, National Agency for Reconstruction and
Development head Roman Shpek and Information Minister Zinovy Kulyk.
</P>
<P>
Of the other cabinet members, observers say Foreign Minister
Gennady Udovenko's position is among the most secure because he
enjoys a favorable reputation abroad and has few enemies at home.
</P>
<P>
Filenko said likely candidates for new appointments are PDP
leader Anatoly Matviyenko and fellow party member Anatoly
Tolstoukhov, who currently serves as deputy Cabinet minister and
may take Pustovoitenko's place as head of the Cabinet apparatus.

<HEADLINE> Egypt's Oil Export Up in 1996/97 Fiscal Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Egypt's export of crude oil and oil
products reached 2.764 billion U.S. dollars in value in the past
fiscal year ending June 30, up 14 percent from a year ago, an
Arabic daily reported today.
</P>
<P>
The Al Ahram quoted Petroleum Minister Hamdi Al-Banbi as saying
that production has begun since last year in seven new oil fields
in the Western Desert and the Suez Gulf, as well as in five new
natural gas plants near the Mediterranean Sea and in the Nile
Delta. But he did not elaborate.
</P>
<P>
Egypt, a member of the Organization of Arab Petroleum Exporting
Countries and the fourth largest oil exporter in Africa, has a
proven crude reserve of 3.9 billion barrels and produces about
917,000 barrels of oil a day. It exports about half of its output.
</P>
<P>
Al-Banbi said the value of local consumption of petroleum
products and natural gas reached 10.7 billion dollars in the past
fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
Natural gas is now available in 76,000 homes in the capital
Cairo, 40,000 homes in Alexandria and 14,000 homes in Port Said,
both on the coast of the Mediterranean, according to the minister.
</P>
<P>
Egypt's production of natural gas has grown five times during
last 15 years, from 2.2 billion cubic meters in 1981 to around 13
billion in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The government is reportedly planning to provide nearly 1.5
million housing units with natural gas during the coming six years.
</P>
<P>
Egypt has recently concluded nine agreements with eight
international companies which will inject 102 million dollars to
dig in 29 oil and gas fields, he said.
</P>
<P>
Al-Banbi has endorsed the timetable and plans of action to set
up three large oil projects during the ongoing fiscal year (July
1, 1997-June 30, 1998), the first year of the country's fourth
five-year plan.

<HEADLINE> Alonso to Face Dewulf in Final </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
VIENNA, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Spanish Julian Alonso set up a
final match with Belgian Filip Dewulf after beating Slava Dosedel
of Czech 6-3, 6-4 to reach his first ATP Tour final at the
Generali Open on Saturday at Kitzbuehel, Austria.
</P>
<P>
The 19-year-old Alonso took the match pace to make a quick 5-1
lead before he won the first set.
</P>
<P>
He broke a good start in the second half, while the 15th seed
Dosedel wavered 2-2. But he didn't sustain his power and lost his
serve at 4-3. Alonso took his two services to win the set.
</P>
<P>
Alonso won two challenger tournaments in 1997 in Venice and
Contrexville. Earlier this year, he made the third round at Key
Biscayne by defeating Steve Bryan and Tim Henman in the second
round in Barcelona.
</P>
<P>
In Sunday's final, will meet 10th-seeded Belgian and French
Open semifinalist Filip Dewulf, who had little trouble defeating
Spaniard Galo Blanco 6-3, 6-2.
</P>
<P>
Dewulf, who recorded his only tournament win at the 1995 hard
court CA-Trophy in Vienna, had an easier task against French Open
quarter-finalist Blanco.
</P>
<P>
The Belgian, who has not lost a set here, needed a single break
at 2-0 to take the first set, and breaks at 1-0 and 5-2 to enter
his first final of 1997.

<HEADLINE> Cypriot FM Returns After Consultation with Greek </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus' Foreign Minister Ioannis
Kasoulides returned home today from Athens after two-day
consultations with Greek government prior to the second round of
direct talks between the Greek and Turkish Cypriot sides.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters upon his return, Kasoulides said he had a
"useful exchange of views" with the Greek government on specific
issues relating to the talks scheduled for August 11-16 in
Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
Kasoulides said he briefed his Greek counterpart Theodoros
Pangalos on the latest developments ahead of the forthcoming
negotiations and prior to a meeting of the island's political
leadership on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Kasoulides was accompanied by Attorney General Alecos
Markides who was President Glafcos Clerides' legal advisor at the
U.N.-led first round direct talks earlier this month near New York.
</P>
<P>
"This exchange of views showed a convergence of opinion on
almost all the issues at hand," he added.
</P>
<P>
Referring to Turkey's threats to partially integrate Cyprus'
northern areas, the Minister said Greece shared the position
the Cypriot government has adopted on the matter and agreed
with its response to the Turkish provocations.
</P>
<P>
According to reports reaching here from Athens, Greek Foreign
Minister Pangalos was quoted as saying Friday night after a
meeting with Kasoulides that the Greek government is determined
to stand by the Cypriot government using all its contacts and
work for a just and lasting settlement for the Cyprus issue.
</P>
<P>
"We insist that this is the time to have a Cyprus solution and
we believe there must be a final end to the Turkish occupation of
part of Cyprus," Pangalos told reporters.
</P>
<P>
He also noted the start of European Union (EU) - Cyprus
accession talks early next year offers an opportunity for a
settlement of the protracted Cyprus question.
</P>
<P>
A Cyprus solution, he added, will be a significant step
towards the improvement of the climate in southeastern
Mediterranean and will promote Turkey's prospects toward Europe.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided since 1974 when Turkish troops took
over the northern third of the island in the wake of a failed
coup seeking union with Greece.
</P>
<P>
Greece and Turkey, both NATO allies, have been at odds over
this East Mediterranean strategic island.
</P>
<P>
But the two countries' relations have been improved recently,
especially by an agreement reached in Madrid earlier this
month that they agreed to settle disputes by peaceful means
based on mutual consent and without use of force or threat
of force.

HARARE, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's ruling party, Zimbabwe
African National Union-Patriotic Front (ZANU-PF) has agreed on an
affirmative action to enable more women to get top government
positions.
</P>

ISLAMABAD, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz
Sharif said today it was his keen desire to see restoration of
peace to Afghanistan as it would not only benefit the Afghan
people but the entire region as well.
</P>
<P>
Sharif made the remarks when addressing a gathering at Torkham,
a small town bordering Afghanistan and about 200 km northwest of
here, according to a report by the Associated Press of Pakistan
(APP).
</P>
<P>
However, the APP made no mention of the purpose of Sharif's
visit to the border town at a time when fighting between Afghan
warring factions was escalating north of Kabul, capital of
Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan was playing its due role in this regard and would
continue to do so in a bid to solve the problems confronting the
people there, Sharif was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Peace in Afghanistan was also vital for economic development of
all the countries in the region, he said, adding that it was
incumbent upon Pakistan to fulfill its responsibility in these
circumstances.
</P>
<P>
Sharif said Pakistan has been striving to bring all the rival
factions in Afghanistan to the negotiating table in efforts to
seek lasting peace in the war-ravaged country.

<HEADLINE> Jordan Condemns Israel's New Settlement Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, July 26 (Xinhua) - The Jordanian government here today
condemned an Israeli plan to build a new Jewish settlement in Arab
east Jerusalem as another violation of its peace deal with the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
"The Jordanian government rejected and condemned such decisions
and warned the danger in implementing such settlement," Nasser
Lawzi, acting Minister of State for Information Affairs, read a
statement after a regular cabinet meeting.
</P>
<P>
Israel`s Jerusalem municipal authority Thursday authorized a
American Jewish millionaire to build 70 Jewish homes in the heart
of the Arab neighborhood of Ras el Amud of east Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
This was the second time this year that Israel made such
decisions. The first was in March which has put the peace process
into an impasse.
</P>
<P>
The building of the new Jewish settlement would further
escalate tensions which have been high since Israel broke ground
for the controversial Har Homa settlement in March, said Lawzi.
</P>
<P>
The Jordanian government believed that Israeli moves like these
violated the terms of the Middle East peace process, he added.
</P>

<P>
TEHRAN, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Three people of a family were

<HEADLINE> Kenyan Opposition Mandates Body for Talks With </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan opposition parties today
mandated the National Convention Executive Council (NCEC) to
negociate with the ruling party on constitutional reforms, the
Kenyan Television Network (KTN) reported.
</P>
<P>
The ruling Kenya African National Union (KANU) "has no rights
to suggest fool to represent the opposition during the talks,"
said official opposition leader Kijana Wamalwa at a rally of some
5,000 people held in Kenya's main port city Mombasa.
</P>
<P>
The rally was also attended by leaders from other main
opposition parties, the Democratic Party, National Development
Party, Social Democratic Party and FORD-Asili.
</P>
<P>
The leaders, who advocated for minimum constitutional reforms
since the beginning of this year, now calls for the "total"
reforms before the forthcoming elections.
</P>
<P>
The government issued a permit to the Mombasa rally, avoiding
a potential violent confrontation between the opposition
supporters and the government.
</P>
<P>
While the meeting was held in Mombasa, three detachments of
riot police were sent to patrol the Indian Ocean port city which
is at the heart of Kenyan's tourism industry.
</P>
<P>
Thirteen people were killed on July 7 around the country in
running battles between the riot police and demonstrators in
kenya's worst civil unrest for seven years.
</P>
<P>
President Daniel arap Moi said on July 16 that permits for
rallies would automatically be granted except in exceptional
cases.
</P>
<P>
The United States Friday welcomed a government plan for talks
with the opposition and for political reforms before general
elections, saying it is essential that pre-election rallies and
other events remained peaceful.
</P>
<P>
As many as 22 foreign embassies and high commissions in Kenya
sent a letter to President Moi a few days ago, urging him to
pursue dialogue with the opposition to avoid more political
violence, according to the local press reports today.
</P>
<P>
Adding to pressure on the Moi government, the International
Monetary Fund (IMF) has given the government one week to
demonstrate strong management and make commitments of
accountability or lose a large annual loan.
</P>
<P>
The IMF gave Kenya a three-year loan package worth 205 million
U.S. Dollars in April last year, but regular payments could be
made on the condition that Kenya met promises on reform issues.
</P>
<P>
From May to July, violence has been escalating when the
opposition repeatedly tried to hold rallies without governmental
permit in a bid to press for constitutional reforms before the
general elections. All the rallies were broken up by the police.
</P>
<P>
Under the current constitution, any candidate, if he wins no
less than 25 percent of votes respectively in five of the eight
provinces of Kenya, he can be qualified as a legal president.
</P>
<P>
The opposition leaders urged to change the clause, demanding
the future president get more than 50 percent of the total votes
nationwide. This has always been refused by Moi.

<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian President
Benjamin Mkapa left here today for the Democratic Republic of
Congo (formerly Zaire) for a one-day visit during which he will
hold talks with President Laurent Kabila.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and
International Co-operation said that the talks between Mkapa and
Kabila will focus on future political and bilateral ties between
the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The Tanzaanian president, accompanied by Minister for Foreign
Affairs and International Co-operation Jakaya Kikwete and other
senior officials, was expected to make a stop-over in Kigali,
Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
During his brief stop in Kigali, Mkapa planned to hold
discussions with President Pasteur Bizimungu.
</P>
<P>
This is President Mkapa's first visit to Kinshasa since Kabila
swept to power after a seven-month war which ousted former
Zairean President Mobutu Sese Seko.
</P>
<P>
According to the statement, other issues to dominate the talks
include the speedy return of 100,000 Congoless refugees who fled
into Tanzania during the political turmoil in former Zaire.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania to Start State Television Broadcasting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian Prime Minister
Frederick Sumaye today asked the Tanzania Broadcasting Commission
to technically assist the government in starting the state
television in phases during this fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
Inaugurating the commission's new board in Dodoma, central
Tanzania, Sumaye said that state television would start by
beaming signals in Dar es Salaam and coastal regions and later
expand nationwide.
</P>
<P>
"Since the government's coffers are thin, starting up on a
national approach will still be difficult and might take longer.
Therefore, the best strategy should be to begin in phases," said
the prime minister.
</P>
<P>
He added that the government banked on the commission because
it had a pool of experts who could best advise the government on
the setting up of the state television.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Sumaye commended the work of the media in the
country but challenged them to develop journalism, saying it is
high time for journalists to report positive events when the
county is making reforms economically and politically.
</P>
<P>
He also urged private televisions in the country to have more
local programs for the benefit of viewers.
</P>
<P>
He suggested that private radio stations in Tanzania broadcast
their news bulletins at different time to ensure the effective
dissemination of news in the country.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, July 26 (Xinhua) -- The Tanzania-Zambia Railway
Authority (TAZARA ) has launched an aggressively marketing drive
in Zambia, South Africa and the Democratic Republic of Congo, the
Zambia News agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
The Zambia News Agency quoted TAZARA Director for marketing
and traffic Joseph Minsula as saying today in the Tanzanian
capital Dar es Salaam that the marketing strategy involves
sensitising staff on the needs of customers.
</P>
<P>
The strategy includes a managerial information system to
facilitate tracking of cargo on all routes, Minsula said.
</P>
<P>
The marketing program also entails increasing cooperation
between the company and the Tanzaian Harbors Authority to service
the Dar es Salaam Corridor more efficiently.
</P>
<P>
He told TAZARA will by September purchease six locomotives
to improve its performance.
</P>
<P>
The production of TAZARA has been on decline in the last few years.
It transported 636,000 tons of cargo in 1995 compared to 662,000
tons of cargo it transported in 1994.

<HEADLINE> Nigerians Warned Against Misleading by Foreign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 26 (Xinhua) -- A state military administrator has
adviced Nigerians not to be misled into believing that the unity
of Nigeria could be achieved by international mischief makers,
local media reported today.
</P>
<P>
The foreign media have been spreading information about issues
they do not understand with an intent to destabilize the country,
said Rivers State Administrator Musa Shehu.
</P>
<P>
They also intended to derail the on-going transition to civil
rule in the country, he added.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria has made some amendment to its transition programs by
shifting state governorship and assembly election from the second
half of this year to next year.
</P>
<P>
According to the new timetable, elections of state governors
and president will be held together.
</P>
<P>
The change in the timetable, which is meant to avoid possible
trouble between civilian state governors and the military head of
state, has led to speculation whether the military will hand over
power to the civilian government in October,1998 as it announced.
</P>
<P>
Shehu, however, expressed his confidence in the sincerity of
Nigerian President Sani Abacha in ensuring a successful
implementation of the program to usher in a democratically
elected government.

<HEADLINE> Iran's Foreign Debts Drop to 6 Billion Dollars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Hashemi
Rafsanjani announced today that Iran's foreign debts have dropped
to 6 billion U.S. dollars from the record of 33 billion dollars
three years ago.
</P>
<P>
The outgoing president made the statement while addressing a
group of bank managers. He said that the reduction of foreign
debt "indicates the manufacturing capability of the country."
</P>
<P>
However, the amount of Iran's foreign debt announced by
Rafsanjani surprised many as the recent official figures put
Iran's debt at over 18 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
According to a report by the official news agency IRNA,
the 64-year-old president appreciated the basic role played by
Iranian banks in financing reconstruction projects.
</P>
<P>
He said that the progress made by the country today was
a result of current reconstruction programs.
</P>
<P>
He said the banks have taken part in the infrastructural
investments, adopted measures to attract public confidence and
deposits and managed to transform the negative trends in
financial sector to positive.
</P>
<P>
"The economic stability in Iran has served to neutralize
the political pressures being exerted on Iran and the reduction
in dependence upon foreign countries," he added.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the anti-Iran policy of the United States, he
said, the failure of the U.S. Congress plan to exert pressure on
Iran indicated the economic strength of the country.
</P>
<P>
Finance and Economic Minister Morteza Mohammad Khan said at
the meeting that Iran's banking deposits hit 100,000 billion
Rials (about 33 billion dollars) during the 12-month period
starting March 21, 1996.
</P>
<P>
He said that some 60,000 billion Rials (about 20 billion
dollars) were extended in banking loans to Iranians.
</P>
<P>
Mohammad Khan said the inflation was brought down to below
16 percent last year from 43 percent in the preceding year.
However, unofficial estimates have put Iran's inflation as high
as 50 percent.

<P>
KUWAIT CITY, July 26 (Xinhua) -- French Defense Minister Alain
Richard will arrive in Saudi Arabia Sunday on a two-day official
visit that would focus on defense cooperation between the two
countries and French arms sale to the kingdom.
</P>
<P>
Reports reaching here today said Richard is expected to hold
lengthy talks with his Saudi counterpart Prince Sultan Bin Abdul
Aziz to tackle bilateral military and defense cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The sources close to the French embassy in Riyadh said that
France had signed a deal for the supply of arms and military
instruments to Saudi Arabia worth 3.8 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
They said the talks would likely touch upon a French desire to
sell 250 tanks to Saudi Arabia against stiff competition from the
United States and Britain.
</P>
<P>
They also revealed that France had received a Saudi request to
purchase a third French frigate worth 1.133 billion dollars. The
kingdom received two French frigates last April as part of a deal
signed in 1994 to the tune of two billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
France has been a major arms supplier to the oil-rich Saudi
Arabia.
</P>
<P>
Prince Sultan visited France last March at the invitation of
President Jacques Chirac, on way back home from a visit to the
United States.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Warns Against Worsening Peace Prospects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr
Moussa today warned the peace process could slide into abyss if
Israel's settlement policy continues unbridled.
</P>
<P>
Moussa sounded the alarm in the wake of talks between President
Hosni Mubarak and Palestinian National Authority President Yasser
Arafat in the Mediterranean port city of Alexandria.
</P>
<P>
The Arafat-Mubarak summit came two days after Israel's
Jerusalem municipality gave green light to the building of a
Jewish settler enclave in the 11,000-strong Arab neighborhood of
Ras el Amud in the heart of East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Moussa said that the planned Jewish enclave and other ongoing
Israeli settlement activities would pull down the real bases upon
which the peace process can continue.
</P>
<P>
He warned that the confiscation of Palestinian lands and rights
will be inevitable once Israel goes ahead with the new settlement
in the Palestinian village.
</P>
<P>
"All should rally to stop and put a limit to the Israeli
settlement policy in order to forestall any further deterioration of
the already-grave situation, otherwise it will negatively reflect
on the peace tracks and the whole region as well," he added.
</P>
<P>
Combined mediation efforts so far have failed to galvanize the
crippled Palestinian-Israeli peace talks since March as Israel
began building thousands of homes for Jewish settlers in Har Homa
in East Jerusalem, which the Palestinians want as their future
capital.
</P>
<P>
Moussa added that the main points that require profound
discussions are the "necessity of forging a solution to the
economic embargo clamped on the Palestinians, the construction of
settlements in Palestinian territories and the stalemate
witnessed on the Palestinian-Israeli track as well as Israeli
redeployment.
</P>
<P>
"Egypt's stance is clear-cut and recognizes the exigency of
salvaging the peace process, a momentous and principal drive where
concentration on subsidiary matters are not enough," said the
Egyptian top diplomat.
</P>
<P>
Moussa also dismissed a European proposal for a four-power
summit among Mubarak, Arafat, Jordan's King Hussein and Israeli
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the convocation of any summit must be based on
progress in the peace process and on results to be achieved in
favor of the peace drive.
</P>
<P>
"Any summit is not an end in itself to give a space of time to
Israel to carry on with its settlement activities as was the case
in many occasions before," he said, adding that Egypt insists on
the importance of realizing an equitable peace and giving every
party its own rights.
</P>
<P>
Over the past few days, Arafat held talks with Israeli
opposition Labor Party leader Ehud Barak, Foreign Minister David
Levy and a number of European officials in a bid to rescue the
peace process.
</P>
<P>
But according to Moussa, Arafat is "extremely pessimistic"
about further talks between PNA Minister of Planning and
International Cooperation Nabil Sha'ath and Levy, whom the
Palestinian leader personally met in Brussels Wednesday, in the
highest-level contact between the two sides in the five months
since crisis began.

<HEADLINE> Rafsanjani Inaugurates Giant Oil Refinery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Hashemi
Rafsanjani tonight inaugurated a giant oil refinery with an
investment of 1.5 billion U.S. dollar and 1.6 billion rials
(500,000 dollars) in souther port of Bandar Abbas.
</P>
<P>
Iran's official news agency IRNA said that the refinery is one
of the biggest in the world and the 8th in Iran. It has been
constructed on a 700-hectare plot of land about six kilometers
from the Persian Gulf coast.
</P>
<P>
IRNA said that it is considered one of the most modern oil
installations using sea water in its cooling system which is
recyclable without causing any environmental complications.
</P>
<P>
The refinery meets all modern specifications in matters of
energy conservation, safety, adaptability and international
standard compatibility, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
It took five years to complete the project with a capacity of
refining 232,000 barrels of oil per day. The major products will
consist of liquid gas, gasoline, jet fuel, kerosene, tar, sulphur
and other petroleum by-products.
</P>
<P>
The refinery is also expected to run at the capacity to meet
its domestic requirements in oil in addition to exporting its
various oil products, IRNA added.
</P>
<P>
Iran, the fourth largest oil producer and the second largest
oil exporter in the world, yields 3.6 million barrels per day
(bpd) and exports 2.5 million bpd in accordance with OPEC quota.
</P>
<P>
Iran oil export earnings, which stood at 19.1 billion dollars
last year, accounts for nearly 80 percent of its total export
revenue.

ISLAMABAD, July 27 (Xinhua) -- Forces opposing the Afghan
Islamic Taliban militia today sent out an ultimatum to the
militia, demanding them to pull out of the capital city of Kabul
in 24 hours, informed sources said.
</P>
<P>
The anti-Taliban alliance, whose forces have advanced to within
the rocket range of Kabul, warned in the ultimatum if the Taliban
failed to meet the deadline, they would launch a strong offensive
simultaneously from the west, north and east of Kabul, said the
sources in Peshawar, a major city in northwestern Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
Over the past three days, the anti-Taliban forces under the
commander of Ahmad Masood, former Afghan military chief, have kept
military pressure on Kabul while calling for a Taliban withdrawal
from the beleaguered capital.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued Saturday by the United Islamic Front for the
Salvation of Afghanistan, the name of the anti-Taliban alliance,

Huandao 3-1 in a 12th-round match on Sunday, extending its
unbeaten record to 46 at the China Professional Soccer League.
</P>
<P>
With this home-match victory, Dalian led the standings at 32,
well ahead of the second-placed Beijing Guo'an, at 20.
</P>
<P>
Dalian, which went down twice to the Vanguards in this year's

</P>
<P>
Dalian opened the scorings in the 31st minute through Li

<P>
KATHMANDU, July 27 (Xinhua) -- A newly-wed couple and their
family members have been made social outcasts by their community
in southern Nepal simply because they are brother and
sister-in-law, local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
Barun Kumar Chaudhari, a villager living in Mahottari district,
recently challenged his community by marrying his widowed
sister-in-law.
</P>
<P>
This daring act was hailed by the press as a brave step towards
reforming the existing social malpractice and countering the
practice of dowry.
</P>
<P>
However, the marriage drew widespread wrath from the community
elders.
</P>
<P>
They prevented a priest from performing the marriage ceremony,
and called a village meeting announcing that the Chaudharis will
not be allowed any longer to participate in any social rituals and
festivals, the reports said.

<HEADLINE> Singapore's Exports of Services on Rise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, July 27 (Xinhua) -- Singapore's exports of
commercial services grew by an average of 9.1 percent annually
between 1990 and 1996, the Singapore Trade Development Board (TDB)
said today.
</P>
<P>
It said that last year, Singapore's exports of commercial
services amounted to 47 billion Singapore dollars (about 32.4
billion US dollars), representing about 54 percent of non-oil
domestic exports.
</P>
<P>
Shipment, which included freight and insurance related to the
movements of goods, and other services, which included business
and professional services, accounted for about 77 percent of total
services exports, while travel services accounted for the
remaining 23 percent, it said.
</P>
<P>
The World Trade Organization said Singapore improved its
ranking as a commercial services exporter from 18th place in 1985
to 12th place in 1995, the TDB noted.
</P>
<P>
It said that a comparison with three other Newly Industrialized
Economies (NIEs), namely, South Korea, Hong Kong, and Taiwan,
shows that Singapore's share achieved in 1995 for services exports
was the second highest, behind Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
For growth prospects of the services sector, the TDB said that
while competition from other services exporters will intensify, an
increase in global demand for services is also anticipated.
</P>
<P>
Global demand for services is expected to continue to grow by
healthy rates, it said, noting that global exports of services
expanded by 12 percent during the 1985-95 period compared to ten
percent annum attained for the exports of goods.
</P>
<P>
The TDB said that it plans to devote more resources to develop
the full potential of Singapore's services exports, but added that
this would not be at the expense of efforts to promote trade in
goods.

<HEADLINE> Azeri President to Pay First Official Visit to U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, July 27 (Xinhua) -- Azeri President Haydar Aliyev said
today that he would discuss the conflict between Azerbaijan and
Armenia with U.S. President Bill Clinton upon the departure for
his first official visit to the United States since Azerbaijan
gained independence from the former Soviet Union in 1991.
</P>
<P>
Aliyev also said that he would seek removal of U.S. legislation
barring government aid for Azerbaijan until his country resumes
trade ties with Armenia, Inter-fax News Agency reported from the
Azeri capital of Baku.
</P>
<P>
During the week-long visit, Aliyev will sign three pacts on
the Azeri-U.S.cooperation in developing Azerbaijan's oil reserves, in
which the United States will invest 10 billion U.S. dollars, half
of the foreign investment in energy development in Azerbaijan.
</P>
<P>
Azerbaijan, a Central Asian country located by the Caspian Sea,
is rich in oil and natural gas.
</P>
<P>
The United States has been advocating in the recent months
solving the conflict between Azerbaijan and Armenia over
Nagorno-Karabakh, an enclave inside Azerbaijan which is inhabited
mainly by Armenians.
</P>
<P>
"Conflict resolution must be Job One for U.S. policy in the
(Central Asian) region: it is both the prerequisite for, and an
accompaniment to , energy development," said Deputy Secretary of
State Strobe Talbott earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
A 1994 ceasefire ended the territorial dispute, which began
in the late 1980s with the breaking away of Nagorno-Karabakh. But
a political settlement to the conflict, which had claimed tens of
thousands of life, remains a question.

<HEADLINE> Libel Case Against Mubarak's Sons Adjourned Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, July 27 (Xinhua) -- A Cairo court today again adjourned
until September 7 hearings into a libel suit filed by Egyptian
President Hosni Mubarak's sons against a Saudi magazine, the
Egyptian MENA news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Three Egyptians and three Saudis, including the magazine owner,
were charged on July 12 with publishing a slanderous story about
the sons' shading business dealings.
</P>
<P>
Ashraq Al Awsat daily, part of the Saudi publishing group of
the same name, published on May 27 an advertisement for its sister
weekly Al Jadida containing an article implicating Mubarak's sons
in illegal business dealings.
</P>
<P>
The six are facing sentences of a maximum of three years in
prison and a fine if convicted of "defamation and attacking
(Mubarak) family honor."
</P>
<P>
The same court agreed to postpone the case until today during
its first hearing a week ago at the request of the defense
attorneys.
</P>
<P>
The lawyers said the defendants had admitted wrongdoing and
asked for the "leniency and forgiveness" of Mubarak's sons, saying
that they only meant to promote the nascent magzine.
</P>
<P>
Only Sayed Abdel-Atti, author of the article, lives in Egypt
while the others are in London and Saudi Arabia and will be tried
in absentia, prosecution sources said.
</P>
<P>
But the advertised article never appeared in the magazine as it
was taken out in a last minute decision in response to the
Egyptian protest and the weekly's two editors were sacked.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak's two sons, who are both prominent members of Egyptian
business groups, said the ad "included lies defaming their
characters and the reputation of their family."

<HEADLINE> Most Arab Countries Achieve Real Economic Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, July 27 (Xinhua) -- A total of 13 Arab countries
out of the 22-member Arab League recorded a rise in their annual
growth rates of 4 to 7 percent in 1996, an economic report said
today.
</P>
<P>
An annual report published by the Kuwait-based Arab
Corporation for Investment Guarantee, said countries achieved
growth rates were Mauritania by 7 percent, Tunisia 6.9
percent, Jordan 5.2 percent, Egypt 4.9 percent, Sudan 4.7
percent, Yemen 4.5 percent and Algeria 4.4 percent,
</P>
<P>
Six other countries including Lebanon, Morocco and four oil
exporting Gulf Arab countries such as Saudi Arabia, Kuwait,
Oman and the United Arab Emirates achieved a growth rate of
4 percent each, the report said.
</P>
<P>
However, Palestine recorded a minus 3 percent growth rate, the
report pointed out.
</P>
<P>
It said that compared with 1995, last year witnessed remarkable
progress as Morocco moved from minus 6.5 percent to 4 percent while
Tunisia's jumped from 2.4 percent to 6.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
As for inflation, the report said that most Arab countries
with records available kept their inflation rates within
acceptable limits except Syria with 20 percent, Algeria with
19 percent, Yemen with 28 percent and Sudan with 136
percent.
</P>
<P>
Egypt and Sudan were the most attractive for investment in
the Arab world in 1996, receiving nearly 60 percent of the
total direct capital in the region.
</P>
<P>
Since 1996, the Egyptian government has embarked on an
ambitious privatization program with reforms seen as crucial to
attract direct foreign investment and to put the country on the
map as a "tiger" economy similar to emerging Asian markets,
reports said.
</P>
<P>
There is a remarkable improvement in the investment climate
in the Arab world, especially in member countries which are carrying
out reforms, economists said.
</P>
<P>
The Gulf oil-exporting countries had benefited lot from the
higher oil prices last year due to an increase of demand
in the world oil market.
</P>
<P>
The Arab countries were also seen making great efforts to
strengthen their capital markets with an aim to increase the
total issues from the current 130 billion U.S. dollars to
500 billion dollars by the turn of the century.

<HEADLINE> Journalists Detained in S. Leone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FREETOWN, July 27 (Xinhua) -- Security officials in Freetown
have detained four newsmen after the publishing office of a
biweekly newspaper, "Independent Unity Now", was raided, a
spokesman for the military junta said today.
</P>
<P>
Frank Kposowa, whose newspaper has been critical of the
military junta which staged a coup in May to topple the
legitimate government, fled Saturday under pressure from the
military authorities.
</P>
<P>
Kposowa is also head of the Sierra Leone Association of
Journalists.
</P>
<P>
He was wanted by the junta because the latest issue of his
paper called for an immediate departure of the ruling armed
forces and criticized the country's chief justice for swearing in
military leader Johnny Paul Koroma as head of State.
</P>
<P>
Two of the four people detained are journalists working for
the Sierra Leone News Agency, who were at the office when it was
raided, an eyewitness said.
</P>
<P>
The other two are workers at the newspaper's office.
</P>
<P>
Three weeks ago, seven people, including three journalists
were arrested by the police who raided the office of another
independent newspaper.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, junta leader Johnny Paul Koroma sent a message to
congratulate Charles Taylor upon his victory in Liberia's polls
at the week end.
</P>
<P>
Political analysts said the message to Taylor is significant
as Liberia will play a key role in sanctions, if any, imposed
against Sierra Leone over the current political impasse.

<HEADLINE> World Oil Reserves Remain Unchanged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, July 27 (Xinhua) -- The world's proved oil reserves
were estimated at 1036.9 billion barrels by the end of 1996,
virtually unchanged compared with that of 1989.
</P>
<P>
According to a world energy report published here today, of the
total proven oil reserves, members of the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) hold 788.6 billion barrels,
or 76 percent, while non-OPEC countries have 248.3 billion
barrels, or 24 percent.
</P>
<P>
The Statistical Review of World Energy 1997 said the world's
proved oil reserves continue to be dominated by the Middle East,
which holds 65 percent of the total, with Saudi Arabia possessing
the largest share of 261.5 billion barrels, or 25 percent, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
It also said that new discoveries in oil exploration did not
change the total oil reserves because of increased oil production
in the world.
</P>
<P>
The world's total oil production in 1996 stood at 3361.6
million tonnes (about 24.5 billion barrels) while new discoveries
kept at the same level, the report said.

<HEADLINE> Zambian Children's Malnutrition Still Grave </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, July 27 (Xinhua) -- Zambia is one of the few countries
in southern Africa that have failed to alleviate the situation in
child malnutrition, according to a report released by the
government and the United Nations system in the country.
</P>
<P>
The Zambia News Agency today quoted the report issued here as
saying that the malnutrition levels have remained high over the
past two decades with no signs of improvements.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, 40 percent of Zambian children are
stunted as a result of chronic malnutrition.
</P>
<P>
It says the predominance of maize as children's diet is one of
the factors for the widespread diseases among them, because the
high fiber content of maize meal impairs children's ability to
absorb adequate amounts of other nutrients essential for growth.
</P>
<P>
Poverty, inadequate child care and inadequate access to health
services are also causes of the situation, says the report.

<HEADLINE> Zambia Unable to Repay Debts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, July 27 (Xinhua) -- Zambia is unable to repay its
foreign debts totaling about seven billion U.S. Dollars because
of its declining export earnings, an official said.
</P>
<P>
the Zambia News Agency today quoted a report released by
Finance Minister Ronald Penza as saying that Zambia's export
earnings which depend mostly on copper have been declining and
that the country is earning very little in terms of exports.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, Zambia's total debt is more than five
times its total export earnings, making it one of the world's
most indebted countries.
</P>
<P>
The report stresses the need for further debt relief from
Zambia's creditors like the International Monetary Fund and the
World Bank.
</P>
<P>
Although donors' aid to Zambia has been fairly high in recent
years, it complained that most of it has been used in servicing
the external debts.
</P>
<P>
This has left the government with little to invest in its
economic recovery programs, thereby hindering its national
development.

CHENGDU, July 27 (Xinhua) -- Vice-Premier Jiang Chunyun has
stressed that every possible effort must be made to increase
farmers' incomes and maintain sustainable agricultural development.
</P>
<P>
Jiang made this remark during a tour from July 23-27 in

</P>
<P>
He called on localities to study the new situations and solve

the distribution of farm products, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Priority must be given to developing viable crops which will
bring more revenue to farmers, he said.
</P>
<P>
He strongly emphasized the need to develop the service sector
in rural areas in order to link production with processing and
sales.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> India's DMK Not to Withdraw From Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, July 27 (Xinhua) -- The Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam
(DMK), an important constituent of India's ruling United Front,
today decided that it would not pull out from the coalition
government headed by Prime Minister Inder Kumar Gujral, Press
Trust of India reported.
</P>
<P>
Annoyed by the recent crisis within the United Front triggered
by the split of the Janata Dal, Tamil Nadu Chief Minister and DMK
chief M. Karunanidhi on July 14 threatened to withdraw his party's
four ministers from the Gujral government if the front could not
set its house in order by July 27.
</P>
<P>
Former Janata Dal president Laloo Prasad Yadav floated a new
party of Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) on July 5 after a fierce power
struggle with his party colleagues including former prime minister
H.D. Deve Gowda and the then Janata Dal working president Sharad
Yadav.
</P>
<P>
Though Prasad Yadav expressed support for the Gujral government
and favored the stay of his new party in the United Front, Gowda,
along with others, has been strongly opposing the entry of RJD
into the front.
</P>
<P>
Prasad Yadav's opponents also pressed Gujral to remove three
ministers from his government who were nominated by Prasad Yadav
before.
</P>
<P>
The disputes over the fate of the RJD and the three ministers
have undermined the unity of the 13-party United Front, posing a
serious threat to the stability of the three-month-old government
headed by Gujral.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued on July 14, Karunanidhi, who favored the
stay of the RJD in the front and the continuance of the three
ministers loyal to Prasad Yadav, accused some United Front leaders
of forming a coterie within the front and using the front to
settle their personal scores.
</P>
<P>
Vowing to control the suicidal tendencies within the front,
Karunanidhi warned that the DMK would take a final decision on its
withdrawal from the United Front government on July 27 if and only
if the front could not set its house in order before that date.
</P>
<P>
At a crucial meeting held on July 25, the United Front leaders
agreed to keep out of the RJD but leave the fate of the three
ministers loyal to Prasad Yadav to the discretion of Prime
Minister Gujral who is known to favor the continuance of the
ministers in his government.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters after a meeting of DMK leaders in
Chennai, capital of Tamil Nadu, today, Karunanidhi announced that
his party had decided not pull out from the United Front
government.
</P>
<P>
He said that his statement threatened to pull out from the
government had brought about the "desired result" in the
functioning of the United Front and also cohesiveness in the
front.

<P>
HAIKOU, July 27 (Xinhua) -- A major railway project linking
Hainan, China's southernmost island province, with the mainland
will begin before the end of the year, according to Wu Changyuan,
deputy governor of Hainan.
</P>
<P>
The railway will go from Zhanjiang City in Guangdong province,
cross the Qiongzhou Straits by ferry to Haikou, the provincial
capital, then on to Changjiang County.
</P>
<P>
The ferry boat is designed to carry 4,600 tons at a speed of no
less than 15 knots. Plans are for it to carry eight million tons
annually by 2005 and 10.2 million tons by 2010.
</P>
<P>
The project also calls for connecting up with existing railway
lines on Hainan and the building of some new lines.
</P>
<P>
The project, which is expected to cost 4.5 billion yuan and to
become operational within 3 years, got approval from the State
Council in 1992. A firm has been set up by the two provincial
governments and the Ministry of Railways to oversee the project.
</P>
<P>
The railway is significant for the development of Hainan
because it will link the island to the mainland's railway network.
</P>
<P>
By the year 2000, the bulk of the goods moved between the
island province and the mainland will depend on railways.

<HEADLINE> ASEAN Forum Important for Regional Security , Says Chairman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PETALING JAYA, Malaysia, July 27 (Xinhua) -- The Fourth
Regional Forum (ARF) of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations
(ASEAN) has grown into "an important forum for multilateral
security dialogue and cooperation" in the region, the ARF chairman
said today.
</P>
<P>
The ARF "has played a positive role in enhancing mutual
understanding and trust, promoting greater transparency as well as
strengthening the commitment among participants to maintain peace
and stability in the region," Abdullah Ahmad Badawi, also
Malaysia's Foreign Minister, said in a statement at the end of the
one-day session here.
</P>
<P>
"The overall security environment in the Asia-Pacific region
continues to improve." "Notwithstanding the existence of certain
challenges, the area remains stable and peaceful," the statement
added.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Ministers from Nine ASEAN member countries, its two
observer nations and 10 dialogue partners participated in the
forum and discussed a wide range of issues concerning peace and
security in the region.
</P>
<P>
The ministers urged that the evolutionary approach to the
development of the ARF process and the practice of taking
decisions by consensus be maintained, taking into consideration
the interests of all ARF participants, according to the statement.
</P>
<P>
They also expressed concern over the latest development of the
situation in Cambodia. The Malaysian minister told a news briefing
after the meeting that ASEAN will help Cambodia, but only with
permission from the Cambodian government. Phnom Penh had rejected
any help from ASEAN at an earlier time.

<HEADLINE> Changing East China From Desert Into Oasis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANCHANG, July 27 (Xinhua) -- A large sandy area in east
China's Jiangxi province has been turned into an oasis after 17
years of sand control work and development.
</P>
<P>
The results have attracted the attention from outside China and
have been praised as an example of sand control projects suitable
for subtropical areas.
</P>
<P>
Gangshang Township, which is 32 kilometers from the city of
Nanchang, used to have a lot of sandy land, because of a changing
river course. In the summer, temperatures there could reach 70
degrees centigrade, and in winter, the sky was usually covered
with sand. A sandbar moved southward at a rate of five meters
annually, wiping out farmland, blocking roads, and destroying
water facilities. In Zoujia Village, 35 of the 36 families were
forced to move out and leave their homes.
</P>
<P>
Desertification also brought poverty with it. In Gangshang, per
capita income was only 89.54 yuan in 1980.
</P>
<P>
But, since the early 1980's, a large number of trees have been
planted in Gangshang to stop the spreading sand, and at the same
time forestry products have become a new resource for local
farmers.
</P>
<P>
As a result, their incomes reached 2,053 yuan in 1996, more
than the provincial average.
</P>
<P>
Seeing the great changes that have occurred, many farmers who
had to leave their hometown in search of a better life, have
decided to move back.

<HEADLINE> Iran to Form Task Force for Marine Environment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, July 27 (Xinhua) -- Iran plans to form a special task
force to protect Persian Gulf's marine environment, Vice-
President Hadi Manafi said here today.
</P>
<P>
Manafi, also head of Iran's Environmental Protection Agency,
said that the task force would cooperate with regional countries
in the Persian Gulf.
</P>
<P>
He was quoted by the official news agency IRNA as saying
that Iran wants to form a regional organization for the
protection of marine environment in cooperation with Gulf
countries and Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian vice-president cited the relatively low depth as
well as the existence of a large number of coral islands among
reasons which make Persian Gulf suitable for farming of various
fish.
</P>
<P>
"Several marine species including the sea turtles, dolphins
and sharks are among the protected species recognized by the
Convention on International Trade on Endangered Species, and the
Convention on Bio-Diversity," he said.
</P>
<P>
Voicing concern over high levels of pollution in the Persian
Gulf, Manafi pointed to the navigation of oil tankers in the
regional waters as well as the presence of many foreign military
carriers as threats to the region's fragile marine environment.
</P>
<P>
Manafi specifically pointed to the active presence of large
fleets of U.S. military carriers and their frequent military
maneuvers as major detriments to the efforts to save the
environment in the Persian Gulf.

<HEADLINE> Violence Resumed in South Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, July 27 (Xinhua) -- Guerrillas of the pro-Iranian
Hezbollah, or Party of God, today carried out a series of attacks
on positions of the Israeli-backed South Lebanon Army (SLA)
militia in the so-called "security zone", claiming that casualties
were caused.
</P>
<P>
Voice of the South radio, organ of the SLA militia, confirmed
that its positions in Jarmaq, Thoura and Bir Kalab were attacked
by Hezbollah guerrillas, and stressed that no militiamen were
killed or wounded.
</P>
<P>
It said that several mortar shells hit vicinities of the town
of Rihan in Jezzine, causing damages.
</P>
<P>
The 2,500-strong SLA militia was armed and trained by Israel to
police the 15-kilometer-wide buffer zone, established by the
Jewish state in 1985 ostensibly to protect northern Israel from
cross-border attacks.
</P>
<P>
The Islamic Resistance, the military wing of Hezbollah,
announced that its fighters also carried out attacks on the
Israeli positions of Ar-Rasha and Jebel Hommeid in the pre-dawn
darkness, using rocket-propelled-grenades and machineguns.
</P>
<P>
An Israeli army spokesman admitted that Lebanese guerrillas
fired Katyusha rockets at the Israeli position of Kawkaba
Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
Israeli occupation forces resumed bombardment in south Lebanon
this morning and fired artilleries at Iglim Al-Toffah, or
Province of Apple, a ridge often used by Lebanese Muslim
guerrillas as a springboard to launch attacks on the Israeli
self-carved border strip.
</P>
<P>
Israeli gunboats cruising off south Lebanon's Mediterranean
coast opened fire at Lebanese fishing boats without causing
casualties.
</P>
<P>
Israeli warplanes flied reconnaissance missions over the areas
of Iglim Al-Toffah and Nabatiyeh this morning, and broke sound
barrier over the Shiite-populated Baalbek City in eastern
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, the state-run Lebanon Radio quoted
senior official sources in the Foreign Ministry as saying that the
ministry is preparing to file a complaint with a five-nation
committee overseeing the implementation of a cease-fire in south
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
In the complaint, the sources said, the Foreign Ministry will
accuse Israeli occupation forces in south Lebanon of violating the
cease-fire understanding, which Lebanon and Israel reached in
April, 1996, by bombarding south Lebanese villagers Saturday.
</P>
<P>
A 60-year-old woman was wounded in the bombardment when a
shell hit her house in the village of Suhmour in Western
Beqaa. The bombardment came in a retaliation for Katyusha attacks
by Hezbollah guerrillas on Israeli positions in the border strip.
</P>
<P>
The cease-fire monitoring committee, comprising representatives
from France, Israel, Lebanon, Syria and the United States, have
held 14 meetings since this year to look into complaints lodged by
Lebanon and Israel against each other over alleged violations of
the so-called "April understanding."
</P>
<P>
But the committee refrained from making a single condemnation
against either country, a fact which has evoked doubts among
many Lebanese over the effectiveness of the international panel.
</P>
<P>
Mediated by the United States and France, the understanding
barres fighting sides in south Lebanon from targeting civilians
or launching military operations from civilian areas.
</P>
<P>
The Shiite fundamentalist, which seeks to establish an Islamic
republic in Lebanon, spearheads a guerrilla warfare on the last
active battlefront of the Arab-Israeli conflict, to oust Israeli
occupation forces out of the Lebanese land.

<HEADLINE> China's Township Enterprises Key to Economic Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 27 (Xinhua) -- China's township enterprises,
which were developed by farmers, have maintained an annual growth
of more than 20 percent over the past two decades, since China
adopted its reform and opening-up policy in the late 1970s.
</P>
<P>
The sector had a GDP of 1.76 trillion yuan during the same
period, accounting for 26 percent of the country's GDP. It also
had a value-added industrial output of 1.26 trillion yuan, or 44.2
percent of the nation's total, according to the latest edition of
Beijing's China Economic Herald.
</P>
<P>
Township enterprises were the brainchild of farmers, and as a
form of repayment, have provided large amounts of money for
agriculture. From 1991 to 1995, township enterprises spent more
than 100 billion yuan on agriculture.
</P>
<P>
They were also employing 135 million rural laborers by the end
of last year, accounting for 29.4 percent of China's total rural
labor force. In addition, farmers get a third of their income from
the sector.
</P>
<P>
Township enterprises have purchased more than six percent of
the country's patent technology, and science and high-tech
companies have contributed 40 percent to the sector's growth. In
the process, some 5,000 township enterprises have become
medium-sized or large enterprises. This has also helped China
modernize agriculture.

NANJING, July 27 (Xinhua) -- Tea lovers warmly welcomed 1997
production figures showing a 2,000 kg output for Biluochun, a
famous Chinese green tea produced in Wuxian, eastern Jiangsu
province.
</P>
<P>
Biluochun, one of the top ten brands of Chinese green tea grown
in the Dongting Mountain near Wuxian, is known for its delicate
leaves, shape, pure color, condensed fragrance, and lasting taste.
</P>
<P>
Producers have been forced to warehouse authentic Biluochun
tea in recent years due the volume of counterfeit products
flooding the tea market.
</P>
<P>
Wuxian called on the Jiangsu Bureau of Technological
Supervision to help curb the situation by establishing a
"Biluochun Tea Quality Exemplary Zone", with related plans
currently on the agenda of the State Bureau of Technological
Supervision.
</P>
<P>
The provincial bureau issued its Biluochun tea standards in
February 1997, and the Wuxian government has established "Ten
Standards" governing areas such as purchases, quality control,
packaging and ensuring the authenticity of Biluochun
labels. Wuxian has also enlisted experts to verify the quality of
Biluochun and has introduced various laws to protect the local
brand.

It now has nearly 600,000 books in its collection, and will

language, and the library has 40,000 in its collection, including
some extremely rare editions, according to the curator.

The 31,700 sq.m. modern complex, built at a cost of 18.4

with nationwide appeal, has no doubt that the ancient traditional
Tibetan songs she soon will be singing to European audiences will
be received with cheers and applause.
</P>
<P>
"I'm convinced that these songs, which are beloved by Tibetans

</P>
<P>
Zhoima, together with 29 other outstanding Tibetan artists,

</P>
<P>
The Tibetan arts group will attend several international
festivals in Italy and Switzerland, and then hold several cultural

Greece-China Friendship Association.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time China's Tibet autonomous region has
presented its traditional music, dance and other art forms to
these three European countries.
</P>
<P>
"The purpose of this visit is to introduce the rich and
colorful traditional culture of Tibet to Europe, to show the
Tibetan people's lifestyle, and to let Europe know more about our
region," said Danzim, deputy secretary of the Chinese Communist
Party Committee of Tibet, just before the group left China.
</P>
<P>
Like Zhoima, other performers are excited about the tour, which
will give them a good chance to experience and appreciate the
ancient culture of Europe.
</P>
<P>
They are also pleased to be able to demonstrate their own
culture, and believe that their different styles of art will be
well received by the European people.
</P>
<P>
"We represent our country, we represent all the Tibetan people,
and through our performances we will let people of Europe know
about the great changes that have taken place in Tibet," Zhoima

more fulfilled life, such as going out to meet friends over tea or
buying newspapers.
</P>
<P>
The amount of the allowance has not been settled, but details
will be announced by Chief Executive Tung Chee Hwa in his policy
speech in October, said Fok.
</P>
<P>
Welfare for the elderly has become a social concern in Hong
Kong since one in every ten local residents was aged 65 or above
in 1996. Hong Kong's population reached 6.4 million at the end of
last year.

<HEADLINE> UAE Government Urged to Settle Unemployment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, July 27 (Xinhua) -- The United Arab Emirates (UAE)'s
government has been urged to map out a plan to deal with high
unemployment rate among the UAE nationals.
</P>
<P>
"Employment of UAE nationals will be among the most serious
challenges facing the country," UAE's Minister of Communications
Ahmed Humaid al Tayer said in a press release today.
</P>
<P>
The oil-rich Gulf country has some 2.4 million people. Two
thirds of them are foreigners who account for about 90 percent of
the whole UAE labor force of 1.29 million at present.
</P>
<P>
"Estimates show that there will be nearly 200,000 citizens in
the year 2006 searching for jobs," he said.
</P>
<P>
However, UAE has provided a large number of jobs for its
qualified nationals to ease reliance on foreign labor.
</P>
<P>
But many institutions, particularly those in the private sector
have been reluctant to recruit nationals on the grounds that they
lack experiences, work fewer hours and demand much higher salaries
than the expatriates.
</P>
<P>
According to independent estimates, nationals account for less
than 10 percent of the private workforce.
</P>
<P>
In the banking sector, UAE natives form only 8.8 percent of
nearly 13,000 employees, said Tayer who heads a government
committee overseeing a job nationalization program in the UAE's 47
banks.
</P>
<P>
He urged the government to map out a plan to settle the
problem, especially in the private sector.
</P>
<P>
"There should be a plan to ensure jobs for them (nationals) in
the private sector and I think national and foreign institutions
should shoulder their responsibility in this respect," he said.
</P>
<P>
The UAE's Labor and Social Affairs Ministry said last week it
had drafted laws to force the private sector to employ nationals.
</P>
<P>
Under the draft laws which should be endorsed by the federal
cabinet, special sections would be set up at government labor
offices in the country to supervise the nationalization of jobs in
the private sector.
</P>
<P>
Recruitment of non-nationals in the private sector would not
be allowed unless it is proved that there are no jobless UAE
nationals who can do the same work given to non-nationals.
</P>
<P>
The Labor and Social Affairs Ministry will also be authorized
under the drafted laws to cancel the labor permit granted to a
non-national in some cases, including the case where there is a
local worker who is qualified to do that job.

<HEADLINE> Company Bankruptcy Under One Percent of Newly Founded </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, July 27 (Xinhua) -- The total number of new court
insolvency in Hong Kong rose moderately between January and June
this year compared with the same period of 1996, the latest
government statistics show.
</P>
<P>
Official Receiver Robin Hearder said today that new insolvency
cases, including both company and personal bankruptcy, reached 601
in the first six months of this year, a moderate increase of 11
percent from the same 1996 period.
</P>
<P>
There were 280 new compulsory company liquidation orders from
January to June. But corporate failure was still less than one
percent of the new companies incorporated during the same period,
said the official.
</P>
<P>
In the first half of this year, 31,188 new companies were
registered.
</P>
<P>
Company bankruptcy mainly affected such businesses as garment
and knitting, trade, restaurants and canteens, construction and
engineering, and electronics.
</P>
<P>
The majority of claims against individual bankruptcies were
guaranteed debts and consumer credit.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Fighting Oil Smuggling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, July 27 (Xinhua) -- Customs officials in Shanghai,
one of the key ports for overseas petroleum products entering
China, has developed tough measures to combat the city's rampant
smuggling of petroleum products.
</P>
<P>
According to the Customs Office, the smuggling has been on the
increase since the price of finished oil products dropped in the
world market recently.
</P>
<P>
China became a major importer of oil several years ago and buys
a large amount every year on the world market to meet the growing
domestic demand.
</P>
<P>
Customs officers nationwide have seized 62,000 tons of smuggled
oil, valued at 133 million yuan, since the beginning of the year,
and they say they will increase import and export inspections for
finished oil products in the city. They will also join forces with
the police to fight the problem on the sea.
</P>
<P>
China imported 1.14 million tons of oil via Shanghai in the
first half of the year, more than twice the amount for the same
period last year. The total value of imported oil products
imported was 210 million US dollars. Most of it was diesel fuel
for automobiles.

<HEADLINE> Lesotho's Parties Argue on Incorporation with S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 27 (Xinhua) -- The ruling Lesotho Congress
of Democracy (LCD) and major Opposition parties in Lesotho have
been arguing about incorporation with neighboring South Africa,
local daily City Press reported today.
</P>
<P>
Leaders of Opposition parties believed that it would be in the
long-term interests of Lesotho to be integrated into South Africa
although it is not something that can be done overnight, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
The main Opposition parties, including the Basotho Congress
Party (BCP), Basotho National Party (BNP), Marematlou Freedom
Party (MFP) and the smaller Communist Party of Lesotho (CPL),
have appealed to a national debate over the issue.
</P>
<P>
Leader of the former ruling BNP Evaristus Sekhnyana was quoted
as saying that Lesotho should either integrate completely with
South Africa, or, considering the sensitivity of the issue in the
country, it should form a Commonwealth with its neighbor.
</P>
<P>
Senior MFP official Vincent Malebo, who supports
incorporation, said a starting point toward integration could be
the opening of borders between Lesotho and South Africa.
</P>
<P>
"It's very difficult for people to forego their sovereignty.
What needs to be done as a starting point is to consider opening
the borders and allow for free flow of people between the two
countries... as the case before South Africa's National party
came to power," he said.
</P>
<P>
BCP Chairman Tseliso Makhakhe said although incorporation was
in their election manifesto, it was a matter that must be
approached with great caution.
</P>
<P>
"It is an emotive issue and needs to be discussed thoroughly
before any decision is taken," he said.
</P>
<P>
Secretary General of the CPL Mokhafisi Kena said he favors
incorporation, but only after a national debate, the report said.
</P>
<P>
However, the ruling LCD has poured cold water on the idea of
incorporation, noting that the immediate problem facing Lesotho
is not the issue of incorporation, but to formalize its economic
links with South Africa.
</P>
<P>
Tom Thabane, special adviser to Prime Minister Ntsu Mokhehle,
said if economic ties between the two "are formalized and
strengthened", this could be of greater benefit to Lesotho.

<HEADLINE> UNHCR Provides Assistance to Nepal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, July 27 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations High
Commission for Refugees (UNHCR) has given Nepal some 13.27 million
rupees (about 230,000 U.S. dollars) in the past four years for
medical care in its eight refugee camps.
</P>
<P>
Under its program for refugee-affected areas, the UNHCR
provided to the Mechi Zonal Hospital 953,000 rupees (about 16,720
dollars) in 1994 for physical facilities and another 1.61 million
rupees (28,000 dollars) in 1995 for other necessities, the
official RSS news agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
Under its annual program, the UNHCR has set aside for Nepal
about 5.56 million rupees (97,000 dollars) in the past three
years.
</P>
<P>
During this three years, the organization also offered Nepal a
total of 3.66 million rupees (64,000 dollars) for sub-health
posts, the RSS said.
</P>
<P>
Other assistance includes 1.21 million rupees (21,000 dollars)
in 1995 for the construction of a hospital building and 247,628
rupees (about 4,340 dollars) in 1996 for two health posts for
furniture and other materials, the agency said.
</P>
<P>
In 1989, 100,000 Bhutanese of Nepalese origin were forced to
flee to Nepal, who live now in eight camps in eastern Nepal.

<HEADLINE> Developing Nations at Risk by Cigarette Sales </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 27 (Xinhua) -- Record cigarette sales in
developing nations by multi-national cigarette manufacturers are
wreaking havoc to public health and national economies, according
to "Sunday Standard", a Nairobi-based weekly, today.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted the World Watch Institute (WWI) as saying
that the rise in the cigarettes sale in the developing nations
has caused enormous social and economic cost.
</P>
<P>
An extensive research by the organization warns that within 25
years, tobacco-induced illness is expected to overtake infectious
diseases as the leading threat to human health worldwide.
</P>
<P>
The WWI notes that developing nations, especial African
states, are worse off as their national budgets are heavily
eroded by the entire cost of cigarette smoking.
</P>
<P>
According to the research, tobacco sometimes absorbs up to 17
percent of household income.
</P>
<P>
In many other developing countries, households with just one
smoker spend more on cigarettes than they do on all their health
care, it adds.
</P>
<P>
The research indicates that smoking has imposed a heavy cost
and burden on society as a whole in terms of medical expenses and
loss of lives.
</P>
<P>
Smokers lose an average of 25 years of life, the research
says, adding that most smokers face a three times higher risk of
dying before the age of 70 than non-smokers.
</P>
<P>
Multi-national cigarette firms often go after hardened smokers
with tobacco blends which have a higher tar and nicotine content
than the same brand has in its home markets.
</P>
<P>
The consequence of marketing such brands in developing nations
increases the risks to smokers' health, the U.S.-based
organization stressed.
</P>
<P>
Tobacco companies in the world are producing 5.5 trillion
cigarettes a year, that is, nearly 1,000 cigarettes for every
man, woman and child on average.

<HEADLINE> PAL Seeks Suspension of Philippine-Singapore Air Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 27 (Xinhua) -- Philippine Airlines (PAL) today
urged the government to postpone its forthcoming air talks with
Singapore, citing deficiencies in the Philippine panel's position
and legal impediments affecting the panel chairman.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to Secretary Arturo Enrile of the Department of
Transportation and Communications, PAL President Jose Antonio
Garcia urged the government to "reject any form of open skies with
Singapore," saying "this would be immensely harmful to the
national interests."
</P>
<P>
Garcia said that the Philippine panel still has not set clear
parameters in preparation for the talks scheduled for Tuesday,
despite PAL's plea to the panel to "take a rationalized approach
based on true traffic demand."
</P>
<P>
He also called for the barring of Civil Aeronautics Board
member Victor Limlingan from serving as chairman of the Philippine
panel because of "serious questions that have been raised in
connection with his previous dealings with the Singapore
government."
</P>
<P>
On July 25, PAL filed a criminal complaint against Limlingan
for violation of the anti-graft and corrupt practices act.
</P>
<P>
The airline accused Limlingan of "unilaterally amending a
confidential memorandum of understanding" that was "unfairly
favorable to Singapore carriers and damaging to the Philippine
national carrier."
</P>
<P>
As a result of Limlingan's actions, PAL said, the Philippine
Airlines suffered actual damages amounting to 4.5 million U.S.
dollars.

seriously, radio reports said today.

<HEADLINE> Russian FM Evaluates Sino-Russian Security Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PETALING JAYA, Malaysia, July 27 (Xinhua) -- Russian Foreign
Minister Yevgeny Maksimovich Primakov today spoke highly of the
contributions made by Russia and China to the peace and security
in the Asia-Pacific region.
</P>
<P>
The positive and dynamic development of Russian-Chinese
relations "has made an impressive contribution to the cause of
peace and security in the Asia-Pacific region," Primakov said at
the fourth ASEAN Regional Forum meeting held here this morning.
</P>
<P>
He said the Joint Declaration on a Multi-Polar World and
Formation of a New International Order signed by Russian President
Boris N. Yeltsin and Chinese President Jiang Zemin on April 23
this year in Moscow represents a powerful statement of the two
countries "in favor of establishing a new world order based on
equitable cooperation and account of the interests of each other
as well as those of the rest of the world."
</P>
<P>
"The document underlines that Russia and China firmly support
the idea that mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial
integrity, mutual non-aggression, mutual non-interference in
internal affairs, equality and mutual benefit, peaceful
coexistence and other generally accepted rules should become the
basis of a new international order," he said.
</P>
<P>
"It is fully in keeping with the principles of cooperation
within the ARF, and effectively constitutes an important
confidence-building measure taken by two major forum participants
of their own free will," he added.
</P>
<P>
The Russian foreign minister said that another example of the
practical movement towards the implementation of real
confidence-building measures was provided by the recent agreements
between five Asian nations, namely Russia, China, Kazakhstan,
Kirgizstan and Tajikistan.
</P>
<P>
After signing the Agreement on Confidence-Building in the
Military Field in the Border Area in Shanghai in April last year,
the five countries' leaders signed on April 24 this year in Moscow
a more far-reaching document -- the Agreement on the Reduction of
Armed Forces in the Border Area, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said "these two obligations objectively have established in
Asia a vast area of stability along the borders stretching for
over seven thousand kilometers."
</P>
<P>
"This is a good example of how stronger security in the region
can been attained through confidence building in the military
field and genuine arms cuts," he added.
</P>
<P>
The one-day ARF meeting is being attended by the foreign
ministers from the nine members of the Association of Southeast
Asian Nations (ASEAN), 10 ASEAN dialogue partners including China.
The Cambodian foreign minister and the special envoy of the
foreign minister of Papua New Guinea are also present at the ARF
meeting as observers.

<HEADLINE> First Electronic Tourist Guide Installed in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 27 (Xinhua) -- The first computerized tourist
information "kiosk", which with the touch of a finger allows
visitors to make "virtual" trips to sites they want to see, has
been installed in Jerusalem, The Jerusalem Post reported today.
</P>
<P>
The Infotour 2000 electronic information kiosk, initiated by
Israeli Ministry of Tourism, was established at the Central Post
Office and will eventually be installed in hundreds of post
offices around Israel.
</P>
<P>
Up-to-date information about tourist sites, nature reserves,
holy sites, hotels, tours, museums, events, transportation,
entertainment, shopping, restaurants and other relevant venues
can be obtained by touching the screen with a finger.
</P>
<P>
The system, which was developed by the Golden Screen company,
operates in Hebrew and English.
</P>
<P>
The system can also be used to supply information on
government and other public services to the Israeli public at
large, allowing them to carry out on-line transactions and
applications, thus making it unnecessary to go to the various
offices.
</P>
<P>
Communications Minister Limor Livnat, who attended the recent
inauguration ceremony, called the technology "a revolution in
service to the public."
</P>
<P>
It is hoped that these user-friendly kiosks will also attract
foreigners and Israelis to visit the post offices more often to
make long-distance calls, buy stamps, purchase a calling card,
exchange foreign currency, redeem travelers' checks and use
other financial services.

<HEADLINE> EU Pledges to Contribute to ARF Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PETALING JAYA, Malaysia, July 27 (Xinhua) -- The European Union
(EU) today pledged to further contribute to the development of the
ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF).
</P>
<P>
The participation in all ARF activities by the EU enables it
and its member states to bring their experience, means and views
to a regional process that inevitably has implications for global
security and stability, Luxembourg Foreign Minister Jacques F.
Poos said at the ARF meeting here on behalf of the E.U., whose
rotating presidency is now held by Luxembourg.
</P>
<P>
The EU will continue to share its knowledge and resources, he
said, adding that it has always been willing to consider needs
that have been brought to its attention.
</P>
<P>
"The EU has made available considerable means in the fields of
humanitarian aid, training, technical and medical assistance in
this region," he said.
</P>
<P>
As the ARF is moving toward a new phase of activity, the EU
would be ready to play an active role in helping prevent or manage
crises, by working closely with the countries of the region and
relevant international bodies, Poos said.
</P>
<P>
He was of the view that participating in the ARF also allows
the EU to learn from this process which he said has made a very
important contribution to the stability and security of the
Asia-Pacific region.
</P>
<P>
He said that although the ARF is still in its early stages, a
high degree of comfort now characterizes interactions between
participants.
</P>
<P>
"It is the ultimate goal of ARF participants to provide
security and most importantly, prosperity for all people in this
region," he said.
</P>
<P>
The participants in the ARF are nine ASEAN members, 10 ASEAN
dialogue partners including the EU and two ASEAN observers.

<HEADLINE> Israel Develops New Anti-Tank Missile </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 27 (Xinhua) -- The Israeli army will be
equipped with a new anti-tank missile known as the Gill, which
more than doubles the range of the outdated U.S.-supplied Dragon
missiles, reported the pro-government newspaper The Jerusalem
Post today.
</P>
<P>
The missile, also called the Small Spike, was developed and
built by the Armaments Development Authority (Rafael) and has
entered low-rate production after meeting the operational
requirements of the army.
</P>
<P>
The anti-armor missile has a range of up to 2.5 kilometers,
which protects the operator and launch platform from
counter-measures. The Gill is simple to operate and can be used in
bad weather, according to Rafael.
</P>
<P>
It will replace the Dragon, which has a range of about 1,000
meters. The Gill is a "fire-and-forget" missile designed to kill
any target on the battlefield, including main battle tanks and
hovering helicopters.
</P>
<P>
The Israel-made new anti-tank missile has been offered to
Netherlands and the U.S.. Its nearest competitor is the Javelin,
built by Texas Instruments/Lockheed Martin, which last month won
a 745 million U.S. dollars contract to supply the U.S. army.
</P>
<P>
As a result of the stalemate in the Middle East peace process,
the Israeli Defense Ministry and the army have made increasing
efforts to strengthen preparedness for war.
</P>
<P>
Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai has called on the government
to have an increase of 450 million dollars for the 1998 defense
budget.

<HEADLINE> Cambodia Still Wants to Join ASEAN: Ung Huot </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PETALING JAYA, Malaysia, July 27 (Xinhua) -- Cambodia today
once again expressed its desire to join the Association of
Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and said it would accept ASEAN
mediation in settling the conflict in the country.
</P>
<P>
"The Kingdom of Cambodia remains unchanged in its firm
determination to become member of the ASEAN as soon as possible,"
Cambodian Foreign Minister Ung Huot told the Fourth ASEAN Regional
Forum meeting, which opened here this morning.
</P>
<P>
The minister also declared that Cambodia "warmly welcomes the
role of the ASEAN to help restore political stability" in the
country.
</P>
<P>
Cambodia was supposed to join the ASEAN together with Laos and
Myanmar at the 30th ASEAN Ministerial Meeting (AMM) held here last
Wednesday, but its admission has been deferred because of fighting
between forces of Co-Prime Ministers of Norodom Ranariddh and Hun
Sen.
</P>
<P>
Earlier effort by the ASEAN to negotiate between the Cambodian
parties was rejected by Hun Sen, who said the fighting, which
resulted in the ouster of First Prime Minister Ranariddh, was
Cambodia's internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
The change of position was first indicated during the AMM held
here on July 24 and 25 by Ung Huot, who said his country would
accept an ASEAN role in helping bring stability to his country.
</P>
<P>
However, the foreign ministers of the nine ASEAN member
countries said in a joint communique at the end of their meeting
that the ASEAN would continue its effort only upon reconfirmation
of the new Cambodian position.
</P>
<P>
Ung Huot promised that the Cambodian government is to normalize
the situation and maintain political stability in the country and
continue its efforts to make Cambodia a real state governed by the
rules of law.
</P>
<P>
He also pledged that the Cambodian Constitution and the system
of constitutional monarchy with Norodom Sihanouk as the country's
sovereign will remain unchanged and the state institutions of the
royal government of Cambodia will be maintained.

<HEADLINE> Kazak Herdsmen in China Finding Cotton Better Than Wool </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, July 27 (Xinhua) -- A growing number of Kazak herdsmen
in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region in China's northwest are
finding that growing cotton is more profitable than tending sheep.
</P>
<P>
During spring planting, a machine was spreading plastic
sheeting on cotton fields of Xigebi Village in Manasi County,
while Kazak herdsmen worked in the field.
</P>
<P>
"I planted 1.2 ha of cotton last year, earning nearly 20,000
yuan. I plan to plant two ha this year, and expect more than
40,000 yuan in profits," said Yejinbek, a Kazak villager.
</P>
<P>
Back in 1992, however, when eight Kazak families planted about
3.5 ha of cotton for the first time, they got next to nothing
because of their ignorance of farming methods.
</P>
<P>
"We got so excited when the cotton was about to blossom. We
waited in the fields for several days, but no cotton came out. So
we just broke off the bolls and took out the cotton, which nobody
bought," Yejinbek recalled.
</P>
<P>
The next year, people were afraid to grow cotton.
</P>
<P>
Then, in 1994, two technicians were sent to the village, and
the herdsmen earned 700 yuan per capita growing cotton that
year. The herdsmen had more than 4,000 yuan of per capita income
last year, compared to 420 yuan in 1990. This year, 100 ha of
cotton were planted, which are expected to put 2,700 yuan in each
villager's pocket.

<P>
Major destinations of this mail range from Beijing, Shanghai,
Guangzhou, Nanjing, and Hong Kong to Japan, the Republic of Korea

<HEADLINE> Thai Economy to Destabilise Government: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, July 27 (Xinhua) -- A failure to tackle economic
problems, rather than political infighting among coalition
partners, is the factor most likely to de stabilize the
government, said a Chart Pattana Party leader.
</P>
<P>
The government's stability depends on the country's economic
situation. I the situation does not improve, the government's
stability will become critical, the Bangkok Post today quotes
Suwat Liptapallop, general secretary of Chart Pattana Party, as
saying. Suwat is also minister of transport and communications.
</P>
<P>
Chart Pattana Party is the second largest partner in the
six-party coalition government headed by Prime Minister Chavalit
Yongchaiyudh.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Professor Krirk-kiat Pipatserithem, a former member
of the country's planning agency, the National Economic and Social
Development Board, said, "The economic situation is now at its
most critical stage.' He doubted the present government could
tackle the problems because the public had lost confidence in it.
</P>
<P>
He said the government will not be able to maintain the
currency at 30 baht a dollar, as was expected and acceptable, and
it is now falling to 32 baht, losing 24 percent of its value
against the dollar since its flotation on July 2.
</P>
<P>
He is of the view that if the situation worsens, the common
people will be affected with the inflation climbing and essential
commodity prices rising.

<HEADLINE> Colombia Blames "El Nino" for Forest Fires, Declares Alerts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Colombia blamed the "El
Nino" phenomenon for recent forest fires and declared yellow and
orange alerts in its Caribbean and the Andean regions this weekend.
</P>
<P>
The early arrival of the warm ocean currents has caused average
temperatures to rise to 40 degrees Celsius in several departments,
such as Guajira, Cesar and Cordoba, the Environment Ministry said.
</P>
<P>
The temperatures were above historical highs and have led to
more forest fires, explained the Office of Environmental Alerts of
the Institute of Hydrology, Meteorology and Environmental Studies.
</P>
<P>
In July alone, said the Environment Ministry, 616 forest fires
affecting were reported in several departments.
</P>
<P>
While 561 forest fires were reported from December 1996 to
March 1997, more than 700 similar fires were on the official
record from June to September of 1997.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, said a ministry report, the "El Nino" not only will
intensify the present drought, but also will make it more acute at
the end of 1997 and in early 1998.
</P>
<P>
The ministry called on governors, mayors, directors of
autonomous regions and natural parks, and other local authorities
to adopt measures to prevent forest fires.

<HEADLINE> China Urges ARF to Focus on Regional Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PETALING JAYA, Malaysia, July 27 (Xinhua) -- China today called
on the ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF) to focus on regional peace and
security and base the participants' relationship on principles of
respect for sovereignty and non-interference in one another's
internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
The ARF "should take the maintenance of regional peace and
security as its objective, living together in peace and treating
each other as equals as its purpose, confidence-building as its
core task and dialogues and cooperation as means to achieve the
objective," Chinese Vice Premier and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen
told the Fourth ARF, which opened here this morning.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the meeting of the 21 ARF participants is "not to
defuse a common threat, but rather to achieve a common goal, that
is, regional peace and stability."
</P>
<P>
The ARF participants include the nine ASEAN member countries --
Brunei, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines,
Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam, the two observer countries
Cambodia and Papua New Guinea, and the 10 dialogue partners --
Australia, Canada, China, India, Japan, New Zealand, Russia, South
Korea, the United States and the European Union.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese vice premier stressed, "It is important to observe
the principles of respect for sovereignty and non-interference in
each other's internal affairs in the activities of the ARF and
make effort to expand common ground beyond differences, increase
confidence and accommodate the security concerns of all parties."
</P>
<P>
He reiterated that a friendly and stable state-to-state
relationship based on equality is an important political
foundation for peace and stability in the region.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, sustained economic development and constantly
expanded economic exchanges and cooperation among countries may
increase interdependence of their interests and thus provide a
firm economic basis for regional security, Qian stressed.
</P>
<P>
He also described dialogues and cooperation as "major pillars
for regional peace and development" and the Asia-Pacific Economic
Cooperation (APEC) and the ARF as "multilateral efforts based on
dialogues and cooperation."
</P>
<P>
Qian called for resolving disputes through peaceful means,
saying it is "a proper way" to safeguard regional peace and
stability.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that as an Asian-Pacific country and a permanent
member of the U.N. Security Council, China attaches great
importance to the maintenance of peace and stability in the region
and has made its contributions to it.
</P>
<P>
China's stability and prosperity constitute a strong support
for regional peace and prosperity, he noted.
</P>
<P>
He added that China pursues an independent foreign policy of
peace, seeks neither alliance nor confrontation and lives in amity
and good-neighborliness with other countries in the region and
treats them as equals.
</P>
<P>
Qian expressed China's readiness to settle disputes between
states through peaceful means, saying it has tried to increase
mutual confidence and resolve issues with other countries "through
sincere and candid dialogues and consultations."
</P>
<P>
He cited as examples the negotiated settlement of the question
of Hong Kong, over which China resumed exercise of sovereignty on
July 1 this year, and that of Macao which will return to China in
two years.
</P>
<P>
Qian described China's resumption of the exercise of
sovereignty over Hong Kong as "a major event that has attracted
worldwide attention."
</P>
<P>
"Hong Kong's return has further strengthened the links between
China on the one hand and Asia and the world at large on the other
and will further promote peace and prosperity in the Asia-Pacific
region," he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
While noting the good developments in the region, Qian also
drew attention to what he called "the destabilizing factors."
</P>
<P>
"The eruption of armed conflict in Cambodia is a matter of
concern," he said. "Some newly-emerging trans-national issues are
posing new challenges."
</P>
<P>
He called for proper handling of these problems in order to
prevent them from adversely affecting peace and stability in the
region.

<HEADLINE> Tension Grips Dhaka University </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, July 27 (Xinhua) -- Tension is prevailing on the campus
of Bangladesh's most famous Dhaka University, following an
indefinite strike call from today by a students group of the
opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP).
</P>
<P>
The Jatiyatabadi Chhatra Dal (JCD) has called the strike
protesting the "capture" of Surya Sen Hall by activists of
pro-government Bangladesh Chhatra League (BCL) and the
authorities' "failure" to rehabilitate JCD activists in the hall.
</P>
<P>
Last Thursday, the BCL members captured the Surya Sen Hall, a
strong hold of the JCD, after two factions of the JCD clashed each
other over establishing supremacy at the hall earlier in the day.
</P>
<P>
The JCD leaders also announced a five-day program beginning
today which included a student strike in the educational
institutions all over the country on July 29 in support of their
demand.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the university authority decided to postpone
all examinations scheduled for July 27 and 28. Fresh dates for the
postponed examinations would be announced later, said a press
release of the university.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a large number of policemen have been posted at the
hall gates and adjoining areas to avert any untoward incident.

<HEADLINE> 2 Italian Tourists Gunned Down at Chiang Mai Airport </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, July 27 (Xinhua) -- Two Italian men were seriously
wounded Saturday afternoon at Chiang Mai Airport when a gunman
opened fire on a group of tourists waiting to board a plane.
</P>
<P>
The two victims, Sanna Franco, 43, and Rigattieri Franscesco,
27, were in critical condition at a Chiang Mai hospital last
night, the local press reports today.
</P>
<P>
Sanna was hit in the right arm and left shoulder while
Rigattieri was hit in the right cheek with the bullet passing
through his neck.
</P>
<P>
The gunman, wearing a motorcycle helmet and dressed in military
trousers and a dark jacket, had walked up to the group of Italians
and shot them without warning. He then fled on a motorcycle.
</P>
<P>
Chiang Mai is a most popular tourist destination in north
Thailand. The accident could further adversely affect Thailand's
tourism industry following a big hotel fire earlier this month in
Pattaya which killed 91 people.
</P>
<P>
After questioning witnesses, police believe the gunman was
Rungroj Somjai, an immigration police officer who was transferred
to Chiang Mai from the south a week ago after tourists complaints
against him.

HOHHOT, July 27 (Xinhua) -- Edible wild plants that local
people once thought were only the very last resort during a period
of famine, are now making their debut on the menus of many
restaurants in Hohhot, the capital of north China's Inner Mongolia
Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
Many of the elderly can still remember when, in 1929, the city
was hit by the worst flood it had ever seen, and the fields were
left barren, and most of them had only wild plants, grass, and
bark to survive on.
</P>
<P>
Now, to their surprise, these very same plants, not worth
looking at when they had enough to eat in the past, are appearing
in the marketplace in nice packaging.
</P>
<P>
According to one survey, in 1996, the per capita consumption of
meat, eggs, and milk exceeded 30 kg in Hohhot, quite a bit more
than a decade ago, and one merchant explains, "Since people eat
fish and meat everyday, they want to have a change."
</P>
<P>
Per capita income in Hohhot was 3,500 yuan (about 440 US
dollars) in 1996, four times the figure of a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
And the increasing amount of money has brought a change in
clothing tastes for Hohhot's 670,000 people, who belong to 36
national minorities like Mongolian, Hui, Daur, and Oroqen.
</P>
<P>
"The traditional Mongolian robe is not convenient to wear in
the city," Su Rina, a Mongolian girl explained to the reporter
while she was trying on a white silk dress in a boutique. Standing
nearby was a slender girl dressed in black jacket and trousers, a
quite appealing figure to the passersby. "But during festivals, I
still prefer the Mongolian robe," Su added.
</P>
<P>
The beautiful clothing of the young people has naturally caused
the elderly to recall the past. "At their age, I could only wear
the clothes my mother made from her old ones, full of patches,"
said 68-year-old Zhao Shuying, a retired worker and member of the
Daur.
</P>
<P>
But even though she was talking in this way, she was also
fairly well dressed in a white jacket and brown trousers.
</P>
<P>
Last year, 16 percent of people's living expenses in Hohhot
went for clothes, statistics tell us.

<HEADLINE> Northwest Province to Become China's New Granary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, July 27 (Xinhua) -- Northwest China's Shaanxi Province
set a record high in its summer grain production this year by 5.53
billion kg, an increase of 1.18 billion kg, which accounted for a
quarter of the country's summer grain increases.
</P>
<P>
This largest increase in China is the result of Shaanxi's
efforts to become a major grain producer and balance grain
supplies in the western parts of the country -- as required by the
state, according to the provincial Agriculture Department.
</P>
<P>
Increased investment contributed greatly to agricultural
development. The province spent 1.68 billion yuan on agriculture
from last year to the end of this May, a year-on-year increase of
20 percent.
</P>
<P>
Widespread application of advanced farming techniques also
played a role in the development. Shaanxi has cultivated and
provided 35 percent of the seeds, and applied high technology to
84 percent of its maize acreage.
</P>
<P>
The province spent 1.5 billion yuan on improving water
conservancy facilities last year, and its 30 percent of irrigated
growing area produced more than 70 percent of the total grain
output.
</P>
<P>
Shaanxi also is working to help 100 selected
agriculture-related enterprises increase values of farm produce,
in a move to promote grain production.

The imported cattle can gain as much as 500 kg in a year and a

<P>
PANAMA CITY, July 26 (Xinhua) -- To take illegal weapons off
the streets, 244 pieces of firearms were destroyed today in a
neighborhood outside Panama City, said the Mayor's Office.
</P>
<P>
The weapons collected at the San Joaquin Parish in the El
Pedregal neighborhood, some 50 kilometers west of this capital,
were exchanged for food stamps worth 30,000 U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The event was part of the third phase of the "No To Weapons,
Yes To Peace" program initiated by Panama City Mayor Mayin Correa
and financed by the representatives of a private company.
</P>
<P>
It was also supported by government institutions, the National
Police, the Catholic Church, civic groups and communities involved.
</P>
<P>
Organizers paid a total of 120,000 dollars during the
weapon-for-food exchange, which started on June 26 and ended on
July 15, to take the firearms off the streets and away from homes.

<HEADLINE> China Cracks Down on Oil Smuggling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 27 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Customs has stepped up its
efforts to fight an increasing amount of smuggling of refined oil.
</P>
<P>
Chinese customs stopped 41 attempts to smuggle refined oil into
the country over the first half of this year. Some 62,000 metric
tons of refined oil worth 133 million yuan (about 16 million US
dollars) was seized, today's Business Weekly (China Daily) quoted
a report from the General Administration of Customs as saying.
</P>
<P>
The nosedive of oil prices in the international market starting
in March added to the rampage of illegal trafficking of finished
oil to China, said a customs official.
</P>
<P>
The average price of oil in the international market is 17 US
dollars per barrel, about half of the price in the Chinese
market. The big gap prompted traffickers to smuggle oil to the
country.
</P>
<P>
Most of the smuggling was by water, according to another
customs official. South China's Guangdong province, Guangxi Zhuang
Autonomous Region and east China's Zhejiang province initiated
battles against oil smuggling and strengthened inspection on the
sea between late May and June.
</P>
<P>
In March alone, Guangzhou Customs ferreted out six smuggling
cases and seized 7,000 metric tons of diesel worth 14 million yuan
(about 1.69 million US dollars).
</P>
<P>
On June 29, Zhanjiang Customs of Guangdong province found a
boat plying the seas between the mainland and Hong Kong and Macao,
and carrying 1,000 tons of diesel, which was valued at two million
yuan (about 241,000 US dollars).

<P>
KIEV, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Ukrainian President Lenonid Kuchma
today started to name a new cabinet, with most of the 75 former
cabinet members are expected to stay.
</P>
<P>
Economy Minister Viktor Suslov, Energy Minister Alexey
Sheberstov and Minister of Coal Industry Stanislav Yanko are three
new faces among the 21 already appointed ministers.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Valery Pustovoitenko, who came into office on
July 16 after his predecessor Pavel Lazarenko resigned, said
Foreign Minister Gennady Udovenko would also remain in his post.
</P>
<P>
Pustovoitenko vowed to reform the cabinet and improve its
efficiency and enhance cooperation among the 75 ministries.
</P>
<P>
The new cabinet faces three major tasks, the prime minister
noted, namely to develop the national economy, improve the
environment and stimulate the production by state-owned businesses.
</P>
<P>
All of Pustovoitenko's six predecessors had failed to bring
Ukraine out from the downward economic spiral since the former
Soviet republic's gained independence in 1991.
</P>
<P>
The Ukrainian economy dropped by 7.5 percent in the first half
of 1997 following a 10-percent decline in 1996.

SHENZHEN, July 27 (Xinhua) -- Shenzhen, a special economic zone
next-door to Hong Kong, reported a surge in container transport in
the first half year.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show the Shenzhen port handled 471,300 standard
containers in the first six months, a year-on-year rise of 122.1
percent. The cargo handled by the port in the period totaled 15.66
million tons, up 18.2 percent, of which foreign trade-related
cargo volume hit 8.77 million tons, an increase of 13.3 percent.

"More and more foreign businesspeople are now eyeing Shenzhen,
a port which also boasts fine facilities and is adjacent to Hong
Kong," he said.

<P>
More routes were opened by overseas navigators in the

<HEADLINE> Coastal Province Speeding up Chemical Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QINGDAO, July 27 (Xinhua) -- Shandong, a coastal province in
north China, has vowed to build up a comprehensive chemical
industrial system and open the sector further to international
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
"Years of construction have laid a solid foundation for the
further development of the chemical industry," said Pei Xiutang,
director of Shandong's provincial department of oil and chemical
industries.
</P>
<P>
Shandong is now able to produce more than 2,000 kinds of
chemicals with 20,000 varieties, of which the output of synthetic
ammonia, fertilizer, soda ash, caustic soda and tires are among
the top three in Chinese provinces, according to Pei.
</P>
<P>
The chemical system annually puts 100-plus new products into
actual production, Pei added.
</P>
<P>
Shandong plans to register an annual turnover of 40 billion
yuan in chemical products before the new century. Its chemical
sector is also expected to earn one billion US dollars in foreign
exchange and use one billion US dollars of overseas investment by
2000, Pei said.
</P>
<P>
"The province in the remaining years of the century will focus
on the development of agricultural chemicals, rubber processing,
petrochemicals and fine chemicals, and foster eighty large
chemical enterprises and chemical groups," Pei said.
</P>
<P>
The province last year posted a chemical industrial turnover of
28 billion yuan and its chemical sales reached 31.9 billion yuan,
both of which ranked first among China's provincial
administrations.
</P>
<P>
Some 120 joint ventures have registered in the province, with a
combined investment of 300 million US dollars.

<HEADLINE> China to Hold Investment and Trade Fair Annually </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 27 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese Ministry of Foreign
Trade and Economic Cooperation recently announced in Shanghai
that beginning this year, China will hold an investment and trade
fair every year on September 8.
</P>
<P>
The ministry said that China has made remarkable progress in
absorbing foreign investment ever since 1979 when the country
started the reform and opening-up drive.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1996, China had approved the establishment of
more than 280,000 foreign-funded enterprises, with promised funds
topping 469 billion US dollars and actual investment hitting 177
billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
By 1996, China had for three consecutive years ranked second as
a leading recipient of foreign investment worldwide, next only to
United States, and was drawing increasing attention from the world
capital markets.
</P>
<P>
Beginning this year, the former Fujian Investment Fair will be
re-named the China Investment and Trade Fair, which will be
co-sponsored by the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic
Cooperation, the Fujian Provincial Government and the Xiamen
Municipal Government.
</P>
<P>
The organizing committee of the upcoming '97 China Investment
and Trade Fair, scheduled to be held in the Xiamen Special
Economic Zone from September 8-13, has received applications for
registration from nearly 40 provinces, cities and ministries,
which are scheduled to bring with them 1,000 key projects in need
of funding.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 10,000 projects are expected to be promoted during the
fair, according to organizers.

<HEADLINE> China Can Avoid Currency Crisis Southeast Asia Suffers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 27 (Xinhua) -- China, enjoying a table economic
situation and favorable balance of international payment, could
build on its rich foreign exchange reserves, good overseas capital
inflows structure and effective management to hedge against the
kind of currency upheaval that hit Southeast Asia recently.
</P>
<P>
The sharp devaluation of currencies in Southeast Asian
countries mainly resulted from the sudden withdrawal of foreign
capital and the selling of local currencies by international
speculators when these countries suffered expanding deficits in
current accounts, declining exports and slower economic growth,
which has weakened overseas investors' confidence.
</P>
<P>
"But the situation in China is completely different," Chen
Quangeng, a foreign exchange expert, was quoted by today's
Business Weekly (China Daily) as saying.
</P>
<P>
Chen said that most of the foreign capital that has flowed into
China was long-term direct investments under good management. This
part of investment can not be withdrawn suddenly.
</P>
<P>
China's foreign debt is mainly composed of medium- and
long-term loans, meaning foreign fund is stable as its flow back
is limited by the term.
</P>
<P>
Foreign investors, who are allowed to trade B shares only in
China, can not enter the bond and A-share markets. Chen believed
that foreign investor's trading will not affect China's foreign
exchange resource.
</P>
<P>
Besides, China applies strict control over the inflow and
outflow of capital which makes it difficult for foreign
speculators to conduct speculation activities in China, Chen noted.
</P>
<P>
"More importantly, China has a strong economic base, enjoying a
satisfactory macro economic situation," Chen was quoted as saying,
"China's economy has succeeded in a soft landing after adopting a
three-year relatively strict monetary and fiscal policy.
</P>
<P>
"it is impossible that a large amount of funds flows out of
China to trigger a financial crisis and currency devaluation,"
Chen said.

<HEADLINE> Researcher Urges Updating Laws on Foreign Investment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 27 (Xinhua) -- China should update its laws and
regulations regarding foreign investment in China, said Wang
Yungui of the Institute of International Economy, a think-tank for
the State Planning Commission.
</P>
<P>
Interviewed by Beijing-based English paper "China Daily", Wang
said that a new law, which combines laws concerning joint
ventures, cooperative enterprises and solely-funded enterprises,
should be enacted.
</P>
<P>
The move will not only better direct foreign investment but
also stave off foreign investors' complaints about the haziness of
Chinese laws and regulations, the researcher said.
</P>
<P>
Although China's current laws and regulations spell out sectors
where foreign investment is encouraged, allowed, restricted and
prohibited, there are no specific measures to go with them.
</P>
<P>
Wang suggested canceling the category where foreign investment
is encouraged as capital flows always go after profits and can be
barely be influenced by official statements, noting that foreign
investment should not be restricted in unimportant industries such
as beer and cosmetic sectors, but only in pillar industries
crucial to the national economy.
</P>
<P>
The researcher emphasized that punitive measures should be
added to ensure the enforcement of restrictive catalogue. The
approval rights of central industry authorities should also be
expanded to guarantee the wholesome development of the whole
industry.
</P>
<P>
Some sectors, like container production, have been put into the
restrictive catalogue for years, but suffered from a glut of
foreign investment as local governments only seek for local
interests.
</P>
<P>
Also included should be the requirements concerning the
share-holding ratio between the Chinese and foreign partners in
different industries, technology transfer and foreign investment
in research and development, Wang said.

URUMQI, July 27 (Xinhua) -- Forty middle school students in
this capital of northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region
have just returned from a week-long adventure in the Lop Nur
Desert, known as a former nuclear testing ground of the Chinese
army.
</P>
<P>
Since China announced that it would immediately suspend nuclear
testing a year ago, the former military zone has become an
education center where Chinese students are given education in
patriotism and study the country's national defense system.
</P>
<P>
The 40 students, from all nationalities in the region,
completed the 1,000-km-long tour and camping trip in the desert as
part of the center's summer program.
</P>
<P>
The summer camp was arranged by the city's education
commission, and the city's committee of the Communist Youth
League, as well as other governmental organs.
</P>
<P>
The group visited the desert barracks of the People's
Liberation Army of China, and heard lectures on patriotism from
the soldiers.
</P>
<P>
China launched its first atomic bomb in the desert in 1964.

<P>
CARACAS, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Heavy rains have soaked southern
Venezuela in the last few days and have affected more than 8,000
people in the state of Apure.
</P>
<P>
The Sarare River, which flows through the cities of Guasdualito
and El Amparo in the Jose Antonio Paez municipality, broke the
dikes in three places.
</P>
<P>
High waters also razed the houses of 1,500 families.
</P>
<P>
Civil defense officials, fire-fighting brigades, the National
Guard, and volunteer groups have been called in to rescue people
still being trapped by the floods.
</P>
<P>
Calling it the worst flooding in Guasdualito in the past few
years, Apure State governor Jose Gregorio Montilla requested the
national government to assist flood victims.
</P>
<P>
Montilla estimated that 700 million to one billion bolivars
(1.46 million to 2.08 million U.S. dollars) would be needed to
rebuild the flood-stricken areas.
</P>
<P>
He added that there is not yet an estimation of casualties and
material losses.

<HEADLINE> Young Couples From China's Ethnic Groups Like Simple Weddings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, July 27 (Xinhua) -- Group weddings have become a
popular and simple way for young couples to begin their new life
in northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, which is
home to various ethnic groups.
</P>
<P>
Jarken and Nurguli joined seven other Kazak brides and
bridegrooms recently in one such group wedding ceremony sponsored
by the local government.
</P>
<P>
"It was really an unforgetable experience, exciting,
enthusiastic, tasteful, and above all, it was simple; that is,
something we can afford without financial aid from our parents,"
explained Jarken, with smile still on his face.
</P>
<P>
They walked hand-in-hand into the wedding hall, dressed in
ethnic wedding garments, he recalled, noting that this was the
first group wedding ceremony to be held in their remote hometown
of Shitizi Kazak Ethnic Township, in Hutubi County.
</P>
<P>
On that day, he said, the decorated county government hall was
crowded with local people who came to congratulate the couples.
</P>
<P>
Lu Hengzu, the Hutubi County head, hurried to the wedding some
40 km away to preside over the ceremony. He told Xinhua that
although the life of local herdsmen has been getting better and
better in recent years, extravagant weddings have become a real
burden for the people there.
</P>
<P>
As if to make this point, Ahanjiren, Jarken's 58-year-old
father, said: "I have five sons and one daughter. Since 1990, my
three sons have gotten married one by one, spending tens of
thousands yuan. My fourth son, Jarken, fell in love with Nurguli a
few years ago, but we just couldn't afford such high costs." The
average wedding expenditure can be as high as 60,000 yuan (about
7,500 US dollars), he explained.
</P>
<P>
"In addition to necessary household appliances, jewelry, and
clothing, things like cars, motorcycles, and tractors may also be
added to the list of gifts the bride's family asks for," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Although the Kazak people are getting richer as the result of
an economic boom there, most of them cannot afford such a lavish
wedding, and some are driven into the poorhouse by such weddings,"
he added.
</P>
<P>
According to one local official, extravagant weddings not only
put a burden on the Kazak people but also pollute the simple and
honest folkways.
</P>
<P>
"We advocate simple wedding arrangements, but in an ethnic
way. And we encourage young couples to join group weddings," the
official said.

<TEXT>
<P>
BERLIN, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Gerhard Berger took the pole
position for Sunday's German Grand Prix Formula One race for his
comeback to the sport.
</P>
<P>
Berger, who missed the previous three Grand Prix races due to
sinus surgery, drove his Benetton-Renault to the fastest lap in
Saturday's qualifying session.
</P>
<P>
The Austrian, who turns 38 next month and is the oldest driver
still active on the circuit, will be without a team next season as
his two-year contract expires at the end of the season.
</P>
<P>
Giancarlo Fisichella of Italy, who will replace Berger at
Benetton-Renault next year, came in second and will share the
front row of the starting grid with Berger.
</P>
<P>
German brothers Michael and Ralf Schumacher, who finished
one-two in the free practice on Friday, failed to put up good
performances in Saturday's qualifying session.
</P>
<P>
Michael Schumacher posted a time of 1:42.181 in his Ferrari to
finish fourth, just behind Mika Hakkinen of Finland who drove a
McLaren-Mercedes for the third place in a time of 1:42.034.

<HEADLINE> Honey, a Source of Income in Northwest China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YINCHUAN, July 27 (Xinhua) -- Farmers in northwest China's
Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region have been leading a honeysweet life
as the beekeeping business there booms, bringing in 25 million
yuan (about 3.1 million US dollars) annually.
</P>
<P>
"I have nearly 300 colonies of bees," said Long Jiuchou, a
local beekeeper who earned more than 50,000 yuan from his job last
year. "And my life gets better and better," he added.
</P>
<P>
The region has about four billion bees, and a honey output of
more than 5,000 tons last year.
</P>
<P>
"Ningxia is blessed with more than two million hectares of
plants that are good for making honey," said Zong Guanyun, a
beekeeping expert.
</P>
<P>
To develop the region's honey industry, the state allocated 1.6
million yuan and 2,500 cubic meters of timber in the 1970s to help
local farmers build research centers and apiaries. And an
apiculture association was set up in the region in 1994.

<HEADLINE> German House Explosion May Be Deliberate Sabotage: Police </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, July 26 (Xinhua) -- A gas explosion that destroyed a
four-story apartment house and killed six people in the western
German city of Duesseldorf Thursday may be deliberate sabotage,
police said today.
</P>
<P>
Investigators found that a cap on a gas pipe in the basement of
the building had apparently been screwed off before the explosion,
the German news agency DPA quoted police sources as saying.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the landlord of the building and a roofer were
detained by the police Friday in connection with a separate arson
attack one year ago on the same building.
</P>
<P>
Police believed that the two men had conspired to set fire to
the building in March 1996 in order to drive tenants out of the
low-rent flats and rent them at higher prices.
</P>
<P>
But the two men were released by a magistrate today because
there was no sufficient evidence.

<HEADLINE> UNSCOM, Iraq Agree on Weapon Elimination Work </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Richard Butler, new U.N. chief
inspector of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction, said here today
he had reached an agreement with Iraqi leaders on work needed to
eliminate those weapons.
</P>
<P>
Concrete results will be achieved within three to four weeks,
he told a press conference this evening before wrapping up a
two-day visit to Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
The inspectors' team of the U.N. Special Commission on Iraq
(UNSCOM), comprising some 150 experts, is to make sure that Iraq
is no longer possessing chemical and biological weapons or capable
of producing long-range missiles.
</P>
<P>
Butler had spent four and half days since last Monday in
Baghdad where he discussed with deputy Prime Minister Tareq Aziz
on measures of identifying and eliminating the weapons of mass
destruction in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
He said that he told Aziz "this process has gone far too long
and must be brought to a conclusion," and that he (Aziz) agreed
that for this purpose, we ought to work with a new spirit and
determination to finish this work."
</P>
<P>
"At the end of our discussions, we reached an agreement on a
program of work for the musts ahead, and agreement on things that
must be done to demonstrate progress with respect to each of those
three baskets of weapons," Butler said.
</P>
<P>
Both his team and the Iraqi side are aware that "the Security
Council has resolved that UNSCOM must give it a special report of
the status of these matters, a report to be presented on October
11, he added.
</P>
<P>
He criticized Iraq for failing to grant "immediate and
unconditional access" to any location deemed necessary by UNSCOM
inspectors, who would certify the total elimination of weapons of
mass destruction in Iraq before U.N. sanctions can be lifted.
</P>
<P>
Butler also urged Baghdad to provide necessary information for
an early determination of the nature and size of those weapon
systems.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council has been opposing any relaxation of its
six-year-old sanctions on Iraq until Baghdad fully complies with
the U.N. resolutions.
</P>
<P>
"There is a lot of work to be done in the next two months and
the work program agreed upon is only a part of what is to be
done," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
He said the Security Council decision on UNSCOM mission has two
parts - "one has to do with disarmament and the other future
monitoring."
</P>
<P>
Butler flew in Friday after concluding his visit to Iraq to
detail his policies on Iraq and his talks with Tareq Aziz to
Kuwaiti leaders.
</P>
<P>
"It was natural in my view that we should come straight here to
see, to meet with the leaers of the Kuwaiti government and to ease
their concerns about our work," he told reporters.
</P>
<P>
This was his first visit to Kuwait since he took over the post
as chief inspector. He reassured the Kuwaiti leadership on
UNSCOM's unwavered determination to obtain Iraq's compliance with
U.N. resolutions related to its aggression on the small, oil-rich
emirate in 1990-91.
</P>
<P>
He held talks with Kuwaiti Amir Sheikh Jaber Al-Ahmad Al-Sabah,
acting Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Sheikh Sabah Al-Ahmad
Al-Jaber Al-Sabah and Defense Minister Sheikh Salem Sabah Al-Salem.
</P>
<P>
Butler would leave Kuwait for Bahrain tomorrow morning before
going to New York.
