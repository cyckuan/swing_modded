 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MURPHY  
 c. 2000, Houston Chronicle  
INDIANAPOLIS _ The Indiana Pacers often have been described as an
effortless bunch, able to put points on the board in the blink of
an eye.
<TEXT>
<P>
   But in the Eastern Conference finals against the New York
Knicks, the Pacers are putting a different spin on the word
effortless.
</P>
<P>
   At least Indiana coach Larry Bird seems to think so.
</P>
<P>
   ``These guys are a little different,'' Bird said of the Pacers.
``They play awfully well when their backs are against the wall and
they get stirred up a little bit. It seems that when they have an
opportunity to put a team away, they don't do it. It's
disappointing.''
</P>
<P>
   Indiana fans expect to see the Indy 500 on Memorial Day weekend,
but despite facing a team that couldn't even field enough healthy
bodies to do full-court drills in practice, the Pacers are bringing
them the Indy .500 _ tied at 2 with the hobbled Knicks _ for
tonight's Game 5 at Conseco Fieldhouse.
</P>
<P>
   And Bird just doesn't get it. When Indiana came to Madison
Square Garden for Games 3 and 4 of the Eastern Conference finals
against the Knicks this past weekend, Bird thought the Pacers would
come home with a 3-1 edge _ if they didn't sweep.
</P>
<P>
   One win in New York, Bird insisted, would put the Knicks, ``in a
world of hurt,'' and go a long way toward propelling the Pacers
toward a long-awaited trip to the NBA Finals. After all, the Knicks
had not only lost the first two games in Indianapolis, but they
also had lost starting center Patrick Ewing to a foot injury.
</P>
<P>
   But the Knicks won Game 3 on Saturday, even though Marcus
Camby's knee gave out after playing just five minutes.
</P>
<P>
   And then Latrell Sprewell, who tortured the Pacers with 32
points in that 98-95 victory, woke up Sunday with a sore left foot.
An MRI exam revealed a fractured fifth metatarsal _ the bone behind
the little toe.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly that bit of bad news for the Knicks would translate
into good news for the Pacers in Monday's game. Nope. The Knicks
instead made a hurtin' call, with Sprewell playing 44 minutes and
Larry Johnson putting the Knicks on his aching back, finishing with
25 points, including a pair of back-breaking 3-pointers in the
fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``We came out and played just the opposite of what I thought,''
said Bird of the Pacers' trip to New York. ``It's very frustrating
to me because I've been in that situation many times, and the teams
I played on knew that you could probably put this team in a world
of hurt if you win a ballgame.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the Pacers are hurting. Psychologically, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead of beating up on them and taking the life out of them,
we gave them life,'' said Pacers forward Dale Davis. ``And, you
know, they can take a little life and make a big thing out of it.
They have a history of performing some miracles.''
</P>
<P>
   We'll see tonight if the Knicks can pull another miracle, even
though the Pacers are pointing to their 36-5 regular-season record
at Conseco as a security blanket. And with two of the final three
games at Conseco, the Pacers are confident.
</P>
<P>
   ``They (the Knicks) took care of their home floor, and they got
a lot of credit, and they deserve it,'' said Indiana point guard
Mark Jackson. ``I feel like we're the best team in the NBA on our
home floor, and I'm planning on us holding serve. We played all
year long to have home-court advantage. We don't want to be too
overconfident, because we still have to get the job done, but the
bottom line is that they still have to beat us in our building to
move on.''
</P>
<P>
   Jalen Rose agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just because we lose two games, that doesn't mean we're not
determined,'' Rose said. ``We know what it takes to get here. We
just don't know what it's like to get over this hump, and that's
what we're trying to accomplish.''
</P>
<P>
   But even Rose admitted he can ubderstand if there is a sense of
doubt surrounding the Pacers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not saying that going home is the magic slipper,'' Rose
said. ``I'm saying that we're happy to be going home because we're
the best team on our home floor. We played awful in New York. This
is not a good feeling at this point. I would be lying to say that I
don't feel awful about the way we played these last two games.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the same time, we can't allow losing two games to snowball
us into losing the entire series. We have to go home and regroup,
look at some tapes and understand the mistakes we made and find a
way to get Game 5. If we get Game 5, we're back in the driver's
seat.''

LAZIO'S CONVICTIONS, SWOLLEN LIP CENTER STAGE DURING REPUBLICAN
CONVENTION 
</HEADLINE>
   By RANDAL C. ARCHIBOLD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUFFALO, N.Y. _ From the Kostas family restaurant with its $4.99
steak-and-egg special to the Statler Golden Ballroom, with its
$25-a-plate fund-raiser of grilled chicken, wherever Republican
Senate candidate Rick A. Lazio went Tuesday, he persevered to
ignore his swollen lip and mold his message.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio's injured upper lip, the result of a fall while marching
in a Memorial Day parade, and his developing campaign platform were
likely foremost on the minds of those who sat with Lazio at Kostas
during breakfast, toasted him with ovations at the Statler during a
luncheon sponsored by Republican women, or glimpsed him at the
Republican Party convention at the Hyatt Regency here. Lazio was
shaking hands and hugging supporters, while noticeably refraining
from kissing.
</P>
<P>
   In the hours before and after his speech accepting the
Republican nomination to run for Senate in New York, Lazio made no
bold pronouncements. Instead, he repeated declarations that ``I
know I need to earn this,'' and that his positions fall in the
``mainstream'' of New Yorkers. But he tried to adapt to the
interests of upstate residents and even tried the personal touch,
with mixed results.
</P>
<P>
   At Kostas, he sat down with people like Lou Selva, who said he
owns a carpet store and is worried about the flight of businesses
and young people from the region. Lazio suggested Selva speak at a
school as a role model, advice Selva at first seemed to accept but
later told reporters he had trouble swallowing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why would he want me to speak at a school? What can I tell the
kids?'' said Selva, a Democrat. Still, Selva said, Lazio impressed
him and probably earned his vote for the simple fact that he did
not see Hillary Rodham Clinton, the Democratic candidate for
Senate, as a New Yorker.
</P>
<P>
   Several of the 11 residents who met with Lazio at the restaurant
complained about ``brain drain'' from upstate to downstate and to
other parts of the country. Two hours later, Lazio stood on a
foot-high platform at the center of the Hyatt ballroom and told the
crowd of 700 people: ``We don't want to export any of our children
from New York state. We want them here.''
</P>
<P>
   The day had its light moments. Lazio's aides cringed both at
morning newspaper photos of Lazio on hands and knees after his
fall, and at reporters' and conventioneers' puns about a
``stumbling campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   Lazio took his injury in stride publicly, refining jokes he
tried out in appearances after the incident. Soaking in applause at
the luncheon, Lazio said, ``If you keep giving me a response like
that it's going to pop out my stitches.''
</P>
<P>
   Some, however, worried privately that the mishap reflected a
boyish, over-eager 42-year-old campaigner, a contrast to the
problem many bemoaned months ago, that the then-presumptive
nominee, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, did not have his heart in the
race.
</P>
<P>
   Many people voiced concern about Giuliani's health, but an
upbeat mood prevailed at the convention, now that Republicans had
finally settled on a nominee.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani did not attend, having said that he did not want to
steal Lazio's limelight. But Giuliani remained on the minds of
many, who praised for civic improvements, but lamented his
reputation for divisiveness.
</P>
<P>
   Fred Brown, president of the New York State Black Republicans
Council, acknowledged Giuliani's trouble attracting support among
black and Hispanic New Yorkers after a series of police shootings
and brutality allegations involving young black men. That is not
the case, Brown said, with Lazio, who he said was eager to attend
meetings with black Republicans and has already campaigned in
predominantly Hispanic East Harlem.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Rick Lazio is going to be Hillary Clinton's worst
nightmare,'' Brown said, predicting Lazio would ``destroy the
myth'' that blacks and Hispanics would automatically favor Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Those who are energized by Lazio's candidacy find themselves
sorting through his positions and raising questions.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not as abrasive and seems more flexible than Mayor
Giuliani,'' said Glory Ann Cranston, a Buffalo legal secretary who
attended the luncheon for Lazio, though she said she doubted she
would vote for him. ``He's energetic, he's great, but he's
pro-choice.'' Cranston said she would wait to see if an
anti-abortion candidate from another party emerged before deciding
what to do.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio has said he favors abortion rights, but opposes public
financing of abortions, and favors a ban on late-term abortions.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio has charmed many here with moderate positions, even those
from traditionally conservative areas.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's more conservative than Hillary,'' said Anthony G.
Scannapieco Jr., the Putnam County Republican chairman, after
listening to Lazio outline his positions in his acceptance speech
this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   In the evening, shortly after his speech, Lazio beamed as
fireworks erupted around his campaign bus, the Mainstream Express,
which he unveiled at a ball park downtown.
</P>
<P>
   ``You people have enthusiasm that's contagious and it's going to
spread throughout this state,'' Lazio told a cheering audience at
the stadium. ``This is going to be a grass-roots campaign that
touches every New Yorker. We're going to be in every county, in
every community, in every neighborhood, on every street. We're
going to go door to door if we have to.''
</P>
<P>
   Lazio climbed aboard and the bus drove off a private reception,
and then was scheduled to travel onto Syracuse to spend the night
before beginning a three-day cross-state tour.

GIANT TICKETMASTER SWALLOWS TICKETWEB  &HT;     BY TODD WALLACK
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
SAN FRANCISCO _ TicketMaster Online City Search, the gorilla of
online ticket sales, has bought TicketWeb, a smaller Berkeley rival
founded to give consumers a cheaper alternative for tickets to
concerts and other shows.
<P>
   The $35 million stock deal, announced Tuesday, already has
sparked fears that Bay Area consumers could be forced to pay
stiffer service fees for tickets to events at dozens of local
venues.
</P>
<P>
   TicketWeb, which works with partners ranging from the San
Francisco Symphony to Bottom of the Hill, an alternative rock club
in Potrero Hill, typically charges about $2 to $3 extra per ticket.
By contrast, TicketMaster charges an average of $6.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reputation is that TicketMaster's fees are very high,
which makes us concerned,'' said Jay Finney, marketing director for
the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, which sells between 4 and 5
percent of its tickets online. ``My hope is they do not institute
the same policy of hefty commissions.''
</P>
<P>
   But company executives denied they had any plans to boost
TicketWeb's fees.
</P>
<P>
   TicketMaster Chairman Charles Conn said the companies target
different markets and, therefore, have different costs.
</P>
<P>
   TicketWeb, for instance, typically handles tickets for museums
and small independent concerts, and usually can handle all the
transactions online.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Pasadena's TicketMaster handles bigger events for
stars like Bruce Springstein and has to be able to handle waves of
telephone calls and purchases at physical ticket counters. And for
every ticket sold, Conn said the company has to handle another 10
inquiries.
</P>
<P>
   TicketWeb has about 700 venues worldwide, compared with 4,000
for TicketMaster, including high-profile names such as the Louvre
and Six Flags. But TicketWeb is especially well known in the Bay
Area, where it usually has about 50 clients at any one time and as
many as 200 total.
</P>
<P>
   The firm had sales of about $2.5 million last year, but hopes to
more than double that to $6 million this year.
</P>
<P>
   TicketWeb co-founder and Chief Executive Officer Andrew Dreskin
insisted the deal will give it the best of both worlds. He said
TicketMaster has promised to keep the company's current workforce
and name but will help it grow through access to TicketMaster's
larger sales force and Internet presence.
</P>
<P>
   Dreskin said he hopes consumers will keep an ``open mind.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The brand will survive, the mission will survive, the people
will survive and the fee structure will survive,'' Dreskin said,
who owned about 20 percent of the firm. Dreskin pocketed about $7
million in the deal and co-founder Rick Tyler earned $14 million.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Benetti, a co-owner of Bottom of the Hill, said he was
initially worried when he heard about the deal. Bottom of the Hill
was TicketWeb's first customer and routinely sells out entire
concerts online.
</P>
<P>
   But Benetti said he thought TicketMaster ``comes across as a
bigger, more corporate name with much deeper fees.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Benetti said Dreskin assured him that TicketWeb would
continue as an independent business. ``I am confident that things
will remain fine,'' Benetti said.

E-TRADE PLANS VIRTUAL EXPANSION  &HT;     BY SAM ZUCKERMAN
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
In a bid to expand its business with consumers who want help with
their investments, online broker E-Trade Group said Tuesday that it
is joining forces with accounting and consulting giant Ernst &AMP;
Young to form a financial advisory service.
<P>
   The two companies are investing $25 million each to form the
still-unnamed venture, which is set to open by year's end.
</P>
<P>
   The new company will be E-Trade's response to a dilemma facing
all electronic brokerages _ how to grow beyond those clients who
are comfortable making their own investment choices to take in the
much-larger universe of people seeking financial advice.
</P>
<P>
   Most online brokers offer a variety of Web-based tools to help
customers pick individual investments and put together a portfolio
appropriate for their circumstances and risk tolerance. Such
companies as Charles Schwab Corp. and Fidelity Investments have
gone one step further by referring clients to independent financial
advisers.
</P>
<P>
   In characteristic fashion, Menlo Park's E-Trade, the No. 2
online broker, is opting for a high-tech approach that substitutes
electronic wizardry for human interaction. Using an interactive
program developed by Ernst &AMP; Young, the new venture will walk
clients through what in effect will be virtual financial planning
sessions in exchange for a fee that hasn't yet been determined.
</P>
<P>
   The program will ``reproduce the experience of meeting with a
personal financial adviser face-to-face,'' said Ernst &AMP; Young Vice
Chairwoman Beth Brooke in a briefing.
</P>
<P>
   In case that is not enough, E-Trade customers willing to pay a
higher fee can arrange to meet with one of Ernst &AMP; Young's nearly
1,000 financial planners.
</P>
<P>
   There are many online financial advisory services, but few offer
such a combination of electronic and human advice.
</P>
<P>
   E-Trade already has a relationship with one such online advisory
service, DirectAdvice.com. Officials of the online brokerage said
they are abandoning DirectAdvice because it doesn't have enough
advisers on staff who can step in when customers want human
contact.
</P>
<P>
   E-Trade's foray into investment advice is part of its larger
transformation from an electronic stock trader to an Internet-based
provider of a broad array of brokerage, banking and other financial
services.
</P>
<P>
   The company's goal is to persuade customers to entrust it with
their assets, not just use it as a cheap way to trade stocks. It
badly lags in that race. Its 2.6 million customers kept $65 billion
in assets with the company at the end of March. Schwab's 6.9
million clients had some $823 billion deposited with the firm.
</P>
<P>
   ``For E-Trade to gain a greater share of consumers' assets, they
need a way to give customers advice,'' said Robertson Stephens
analyst Scott Appleby. ``This is a low-cost way to do it.``
</P>
<P>
   Dispensing advice electronically is consistent with other steps
E-Trade has taken to broaden its appeal.
</P>
<P>
   For example, responding to criticism that it lacked branches,
E-Trade earlier this year said it would install hundreds of kiosks
in widely scattered locations around the country where customers
could carry out routine banking transactions.
</P>
<P>
   In every case, E-Trade has opted for an automated, electronic
approach, which keeps costs down. Whether customers will accept
such alternatives remains to be seen, analysts said.

YOU'RE NEVER TOO YOUNG FOR GOOD IDEAS 
 &HT;     BY PETER SINTON
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
Dot-com entrepreneurs don't have to wait for high school or college
to get started.
<P>
   Take Ben Casnocha, for example. The sixth-grader at Town School
for Boys in San Francisco came up with an idea for an online
service where local residents could complain about issues, like
tardy garbage pickup, and have their problems directed to the right
authorities for resolution.
</P>
<P>
   Casnocha and nine of his classmates have registered the domain
name Complainandresolve.com and are developing the site as part of
an elective technology course taught by teachers Anthony More and
Kirk Lorie.
</P>
<P>
   ``America is complaining more than ever now, so we feel this is
the prime time to launch,'' says Ben, who received an iMac for his
12th birthday two months ago and does some Macintosh repairs in his
free time.
</P>
<P>
   He sees Complainandresolve.com as a useful ``one-stop site''
akin to KGO's ``Seven on Your Side'' TV reports, where citizens can
post their problems and get them resolved.
</P>
<P>
   The students are using Town School's server and are building the
service with various Web site development tools. Ben and his team
used Register.com to reserve their domain name. They recommend
BBEdit Lite for writing code and use Fireworks 3 to create some
flair such as ``Java script rollovers and navigation bars.''
</P>
<P>
   Like many other dot-com startups, Ben and classmates are not
sure how their site might make money. The main impetus for the
project _ besides learning, of course _ was ``to give something
back to the Bay Area,'' says Ben, who lives in Cole Valley and is
the son of an attorney. But, he adds, ``As we kids become smarter
and more intelligent with computers, we feel like we can turn this
into a profitable business.''
</P>
<P>
   STUDENT PRIZES: Besides Phi Beta Kappa, magna and summa cum
laude and other academic awards, college students these days also
are seeking financial prizes. They want lucre as well as lux.
</P>
<P>
   In one of the latest examples, more than 600 college teams
representing more than 2,000 student entrepreneurs entered the
first National Student Business Plan Competition sponsored by
Garage.com.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, four doctoral students at the University of
California at San Francisco won the $150,000 grand prize for their
Quicksilver Genomics. Their post-genomic drug development venture
would create technology to let pharmaceutical, biotechnology and
academic researchers rapidly discover patentable compounds from
unclassified gene sequences.
</P>
<P>
   During Memorial Day weekend, team members Rey Banatao, Jose
Haresco, Sean Mooney and Sandra Waugh went to Lake Tahoe to
celebrate and deliberate what to do next. Do they each take their
$37,500 and buy new computers and pay off loans? Do they pool the
winnings and pursue their venture, perhaps even dropping out of
graduate school or taking a leave of absence?
</P>
<P>
   Banatao says it is a nice problem to have. The Quicksilver team
also entered the University of California at Berkeley Business Plan
competition that last month awarded $70,000 in cash and prizes.
That contest, in its second year, attracted 182 teams, but
Quicksilver didn't make the cut to the final eight.
</P>
<P>
   Quicksilver was not the only winner in the contest sponsored by
Garage.com, the Palo Alto online venture capital company, and other
backers such as Charles Schwab and Hewlett-Packard.
</P>
<P>
   Kwaish, a Stanford University team helping businesses leverage
the power of wireless handheld devices, won $50,000. So did
co-first prize winner KnowHow, a University of California at Irvine
team that is developing a smart notification service that
prioritizes e-mail and other messages by their importance.

COMPANIES GOING PUBLIC WILL ENDURE AN IPO DROUGHT THIS SUMMER  &HT;     BY KATHLEEN PENDER
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
Somebody call Roto Rooter!
<P>
   The IPO pipeline is getting seriously backed up, with only a
handful of deals trickling out, and yesterday's market rally is not
expected to do much to unclog it.
</P>
<P>
   ``This could be a long dry summer,'' says Steve Bishop of RS
Investment Management. ``It's going to take a few weeks (of
consistent gains) before we get things going.''
</P>
<P>
   There are more than 400 deals in registration, a record number,
according to Jeff Hirschkorn, senior market analyst with IPO.com.
</P>
<P>
   Among them are three high-profile Bay Area companies that are
having a bit of trouble with their offerings.
</P>
<P>
   Yesterday, Handspring, which makes the popular Visor electronic
organizer and was started by the people who developed the Palm,
scaled back its planned offering for the second time. The company
now hopes to sell 10 million shares at $17 to $19, down from its
previous offering range of $19 to $21.
</P>
<P>
   When Handspring (HAND) filed for its IPO on March 31, it hoped
to raise as much as $300 million. That was cut to $220 million
earlier this month. The current plan would raise $180 million and
value the company at about $2.25 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Handspring is falling in sympathy with Palm, which has dropped
to $24 from a high of $95, reached shortly after it went public
March 1 at $38 per share.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Handspring, ONI Systems, a San Jose maker of fiber-optic
gear, enlarged its offering, but then the deal mysteriously drifted
into limbo land.
</P>
<P>
   After New Focus, another optical networking company, pulled off
a successful IPO on May 17, ONI raised its offering range to $21 to
$23 per share for 8 million shares, up from $14 to $16.
</P>
<P>
   But on May 22, the company (ONIS) delayed the offer for a day,
then postponed it again. Some news reports said it would debut
yesterday, but as of last night it still hadn't been priced.
</P>
<P>
   One source in the investment community heard the deal was hung
up by ``minor problems'' the Securities and Exchange Commission had
with the deal. Another source heard the SEC was concerned with the
company's compensation package.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they can't get it worked up by the end of this week,
they're going to have to tell institutional investors what's going
on,'' Hirschkorn says.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, TheStreet.com reported that Williams Communications,
ONI's biggest customer, and Williams Chief Technology Officer
Matthew Bross &UR;  &LR; owned options in ONI that together would be worth
about $40 million after an IPO.
</P>
<P>
   Though legal and apparently common in the fiber-optics world,
the story questioned whether the arrangement would color Williams'
product-buying decisions.
</P>
<P>
   ONI did not return calls seeking comment.
</P>
<P>
   That brings us to CrossWorlds Software (CWLD), the Burlingame
company that gained national attention when its former CEO, Katrina
Garnett, appeared in ads for the company in a low-cut black dress.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 1 of PENDER31 () &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  CrossWorlds was scheduled to go public Friday but postponed it
until this week, Hirschkorn said.
</P>
<P>
   The firm, which makes software for integrating business software
from multiple vendors, was the subject of several news analyses
over the weekend that questioned whether it is lagging competitors
such as Tibco Software, Vitria and Active Software, which all had
the good fortune to go public before tech stocks went kerblooey.
</P>
<P>
   Hirschkorn says CrossWorlds ``has some good clients including
Siemens and US West. And it's developing partnerships with IBM and
SAP.''
</P>
<P>
   He expects the IPO ``will have an initial pop. If ONI doesn't
get done, I expect this to be the deal of the week.''
</P>
<P>
   SUMMER SLUMP REDUX: In a column Friday on the summer stock
slump, I ran a chart showing what would have happened if you
followed a seasonal strategy for investing in tech stocks between
1979 and 1999. That prompted an e-mail from one enterprising reader
who figured out what would have happened under a buy-and-hold
scenario.
</P>
<P>
   The chart, from Ned Davis Research, set up two scenarios:
</P>
<P>
   In the first, an investor puts $10,000 in a group of tech stocks
on May 1 of each year and sells on October 31. The investor does
nothing during the intervening six months. On May 1 of the next
year, he reinvests the $10,000, plus accumulated profits (or minus
any losses), in the index for another six months, then sells again.
</P>
<P>
   The second scenario is identical except the investor buys
November 1 of each year and sells April 30.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the 20 years, the investor would have $10,921 if
he owned stocks between May and October of each year, compared with
$109,390 if he owned from November through April.
</P>
<P>
   E-mailer Craig Willms responded: ``I took the data from the
chart, pasted it in Excel, and ran the calculation of what would
have happened if the investor were to have just left the money in
the stock, rather than attempting to time the market. I came out
with $119,579 as the end result.
</P>
<P>
   ``I might have been wrong in my calculations. However, if I was
correct, this seems like the better strategy, especially when taxes
are included. I realize that leaves out the obvious of being able
to place the money in other investments during that time.''
</P>
<P>
   I checked Craig's buy-and-hold number with Larry Winer from Ned
Davis Research, who came up with a number that was quite close:
$109,430.
</P>
<P>
   However, Winer added, ``if one switched into commercial paper
during the weak seasonal period (May to October) one would have
ended up with a total profit of $111,882.
</P>
<P>
   ``Granted this is not much of a gain over the buy-and-hold
numbers, and does not take into account the cost of making the
trades or tax liability. However, once again, I must stress that we
do not recommend someone use this (seasonal switching) strategy for
trading. It is meant to be used for perspective to show that most
of the gains ... have come from the seasonally strong periods.

ANGELS' MISTAKES ARE COSTLY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND -- The Angels signed shortstop Kevin Stocker Tuesday,
apparently because Ozzie Smith was not available.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels have fallen into a rut defensively the past couple of
weeks, and it couldn't have been more evident than in their 6-1
loss to the Cleveland Indians Tuesday night before 42,910 at Jacobs
Field.
</P>
<P>
   They made three errors in the game -- two by shortstop Benji
Gil, who figures to lose his starting job to Stocker by the end of
the week. Third baseman Troy Glaus is in no danger of losing his
job, but he also made a costly error in the game and wasn't happy
to talk about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``You think we enjoy making errors?'' Glaus said. ``You get
pissed. You get (expletive) pissed. If we didn't think we could
make every play, we shouldn't be out there. I made an error. You
saw it, I saw it, everybody saw it. I made an error I shouldn't
have made.''
</P>
<P>
   Angels manager Mike Scioscia saw it, but wasn't so hard on
Glaus.
</P>
<P>
   ``He takes so much pride in his defense, that's why he's such a
tremendous ballplayer,'' Scioscia said. ``He is one of the premier
third baseman in the game and he'll continue to improve.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has a passion for the game; he has a burning desire to
succeed and he will. But you have to be careful with Troy to make
sure his emotion doesn't turn to frustration. He expects a lot from
himself both in the field and at bat. When he doesn't meet that
level, we have to make sure it doesn't become a situation of
frustration.''
</P>
<P>
   Of Glaus' 13 errors this season (tied with Gil for the most on
the club), eight have come in the past 15 games. But Scioscia wants
Glaus and all his players to move forward.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are going to be errors made,'' Scioscia said. ``These
guys are going to make an error that will lose a ballgame. It's
what you do in the next one, how you turn the page. It's not a good
feeling when you let the ballclub down, but it's going to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Angels starter Scott Schoeneweis (5-3) easily could have become
frustrated by the game's turn of events. But he pitched well after
the Indians scored three unearned runs in the pivotal second
inning.
</P>
<P>
   The Indians had a runner at first with one out in the inning
when Alex Ramirez hit a grounder to Gil at shortstop that should
have been a double play. Instead, Gil booted it for an error.
</P>
<P>
   Schoeneweis got another potential double-play ball when Richie
Sexon grounded to Glaus at third. But Glaus' throw to second
baseman Keith Luuloa sailed wide right and went towards the
right-field corner, allowing both baserunners to score and Sexson
to reach third.
</P>
<P>
   Sexson scored on Sandy Alomar's single to give the Indians three
unearned runs in the inning and set the tone for the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish I was a strikeout pitcher and could strike guys out in
that situation,'' Schoeneweis said. ``Unfortunately I don't throw
95, so I just try to get another ground ball. ... I just wish I
could pick up my teammates a little better. They pick me up all the
time, I'd like to return the favor. They bailed me out by scoring a
lot of runs when I gave up runs. When something like (the errors)
happen, it's my job to put zeroes up there and I didn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Gil made a throwing error later in the game, giving the Angels
48 this season, second worst in the American League.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something we've paid a lot of attention to,'' Scioscia
said of the defense, which has gradually slipped from among the
best in the league to among the worst. ``Obviously it's something
we need to tighten up. A lot of the errors have been on routine
plays.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're going to make errors, you just can't make 'em the way
we have the last couple of weeks. We'll be all right, we'll clean
that up.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, even perfect defense might not have made a different
Tuesday because Indians starter Dave Burba (5-1) pitched well. He
gave up one run and six hits in seven innings, the only run scoring
when Bengie Molina tripled home Garret Anderson in the fourth
inning.

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SCOTT KAISER  
 c. 2000, Houston Chronicle  
EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ This isn't how the Dallas Stars wanted to
begin their defense of the Stanley Cup.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Seemingly a step slow all night, the Stars were handed a 7-3
whipping by the New Jersey Devils in Game 1 of the Stanley Cup
Finals before a raucous 19,040 at Continental Airlines Arena on
Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   The Devils' kid line of Petr Sykora, Jason Arnott and Patrik
Elias combined for 11 points as they outdueled the Stars' top line
that features Mike Modano and Brett Hull. Hull has more playoff
goals (86) and Modano more playoff points (98) than the combined
age (72) of the Devils' young bloods, but experience was no help.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if they were dominant, but they moved the puck
well and skated as well as I've seen them all year,'' Devils coach
Larry Robinson said.
</P>
<P>
   Stars goalie Ed Belfour, who allowed only 13 goals in seven
games in the Western Conference finals against Colorado, was lit up
for six goals on only 18 shots before being pulled for former Aero
Manny Fernandez with 16:58 left in the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was my decision to pull him,'' Stars coach Ken Hitchcock
said. ``He hasn't had too many nights like that.''
</P>
<P>
   On top of Belfour's misery, captain and top defenseman Derian
Hatcher suffered a hyperextended knee midway through the third
period and didn't return. Hatcher, who led the Stars with five
hits, provided the only consistent physical presence.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's minor,'' Hitchcock said of Hatcher's injury. ``I think
he'll be a player in Game 2.''
</P>
<P>
   The only positive the Stars might take from this embarrassment
is they are in familiar territory. The defending champs also lost
Game 1 of the Stanley Cup Finals to Buffalo last year, but a big
difference is they played Game 2 at home.
</P>
<P>
   ``For whatever reason we've played games like this before, but
the difference between 7-3 and 4-3 was Belfour,'' Hitchcock said.
``This puts pressure on us, but we know we'll play better.''
</P>
<P>
   Hitchcock also might have to consider what defensive tandem he
puts on the ice against the Devils' kid line as Darryl Sydor and
Sergei Zubov were victimized three times. Sydor and Zubov were on
the ice for the Devils' first five goals overall.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our whole group really struggled with their quickness,''
Hitchcock said. ``We haven't seen that kind of quickness from three
lines like that all year, and we made a lot of mistakes because of
it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Devils allowed only one shot in the first 10 minutes and
jumped out to a 1-0 lead at 7:22 of the first period. Elias started
the play as he skated behind the net and tried a wraparound Belfour
stopped, but Sykora picked up the rebound and dropped a
behind-the-back pass to Arnott, who had beaten Joe Nieuwendyk to
the front of the goal and deflected the puck in.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just did a little cycle, and we kind of know where each
other is,'' Arnott said.
</P>
<P>
   Sydor tied the game at 13:13 on a slap shot from the top of the
left circle. Mike Keane did the dirty work as he fought for
possession of the puck behind the net and fed Jere Lehtinen, who
slipped the puck back for Sydor's one-timer that beat a screened
Martin Brodeur.
</P>
<P>
   The turning point of the game came midway through the second
period after Ken Daneyko had given the Devils a 2-1 lead. Modano
streaked down the left side and fired a rocket on Brodeur, who gave
up the rebound in front of the goal. Hull was right there, but
Brodeur robbed him with a sparkling glove save while on his back.
Seconds later, Sykora scored off a behind-the-back pass from Elias
to make it 3-1.
</P>
<P>
   ``The game really swung there,'' Hitchcock said. ``Brodeur made
a great save on Hull, and that play behind the net (by Elias) was a
great one.''

AIRPORT CONTRACTOR TO ALLOW UNIONIZING VOTE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RICK ORLOV 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The Los Angeles labor movement scored another
victory on Tuesday in its efforts to organize workers, setting the
stage for even more union activity this summer with negotiations on
contracts affecting hundreds of thousands of workers.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement by Argenbright Security Inc. to end a two-year
labor dispute and allow an election by 700 of its workers next
month could remove it as a target of the demonstrations - on issues
ranging from unionism to free trade to abortion - expected against
the backdrop of the Democratic National Convention in August.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could be quite the street theater,'' said Jack Kyser, chief
economist of the Economic Development Corporation of Los Angeles
County. ``You will have all the world media here, so I wouldn't be
surprised to see local labor disputes mingle with all the other
demonstrations you would have at any political convention.''
</P>
<P>
   Miguel Contreras, executive secretary-treasurer of the Los
Angeles County Federation of Labor, AFL-CIO, didn't dispute that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think later this summer you will see unions taking advantage
of the media,'' Contreras said. ``And I'm sure some unions, like
the teachers union and the (Los Angeles) Police Protective League,
will use the convention as a bargaining tool in their
negotiations.''
</P>
<P>
   There will be negotiations in the huge Los Angeles Unified
School District, with its 75,000 teachers and classified employees,
followed by bargaining for 40,000 Los Angeles County government
workers, Contreras said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Naturally, we are focusing on the larger unions, but we also
have efforts under way to unionize 1,400 recreation and parks
(part-time) workers and the UCLA graduate students,'' Contreras
said.
</P>
<P>
   The county federation - an umbrella group representing nearly
400 unions and 800,000 workers - also has been approached by the
Los Angeles Police Protective League for support in collective
bargaining this summer for its 9,000 members.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure they will be pointing to the convention as the reason
for a quick settlement,'' Contreras said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the unions are looking to organize about 28,000
workers at Los Angeles International Airport who are not now
represented.
</P>
<P>
   ``Argenbright is significant because it serves as a symbol and a
model to other contractors at LAX,'' Contreras said. ``Of the
50,000 workers at Los Angeles International Airport, about 22,000
of them are represented by unions.''
</P>
<P>
   Kyser said the union movement's strategy of focusing on the
lesser-paid workers, such as security workers and, earlier this
year, janitors, has paid off.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, he said, it shows how the labor market is
changing in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at the aircraft-parts industry, it is really in
decline,'' Kyser said. ``We have 52,000 people in the heavy-duty
aircraft parts industry, but that's down by 7,800 this year alone.
They aren't leaving the union, but the jobs are disappearing.''
</P>
<P>
   But Contreras said there are growing numbers of ``invisible
workers'' such as janitors and airport workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are the folks who are making minimum wage and need a way
to get a leg up, to get the training and education needed,''
Contreras said.
</P>
<P>
   Although he said he played no direct role in the Argenbright
decision, Contreras said he has helped influence the five-member
Airport Commission, on which he serves, to be more supportive of
union efforts.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one member can do this alone, but this commission does have
a better understanding (than past commissions) on labor issues,''
Contreras said. ``I have been able to explain to them some of the
issues, and they have been completely supportive.''
</P>
<P>
   He cited recent contracts with the duty-free shops, H.W. Smith
and some other companies that traditionally have been nonunion but
agreed to union elections by their employees.
</P>
<P>
   Argenbright owners had resisted allowing an election for more
than two years, saying they wanted assurances that employees would
not be pressured into joining the union.
</P>
<P>
   Union leaders said the company was the one using pressure - to
try to block unionizing efforts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not pro-union or anti-union,'' said Henry Anthony,
senior vice president for the parent company that owns Argenbright.
``We are pro-employee and wanted to make sure a secret election
will be conducted.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the terms of the agreement, an election will be held June
30. If employees vote to join Service Employees International Union
Local 1877, talks will begin immediately on a contract.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Anthony said the outcome of that election will determine
if a similar vote will be held for about 250 security screeners. It
was decided to place them in a separate category because of the
differences in hiring requirements.
</P>
<P>
   Union leaders said their next effort after the election will be
focused on other security firms at LAX.

 LEGISLATURE OKS SMOG FEE REFUND _ DAVIS TO SIGN  &HT;     By LYNDA GLEDHILL 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO _ After months of wrangling, the Legislature sent two
bills to the governor's desk Tuesday that will refund the $300 smog
impact fee to residents who moved into the state.
</P>
<P>
   About 1.7 million Californians over the past decade paid the fee
when they moved here and registered their vehicles. But a state
appeals court ruled it unconstitutional last year, and Gov. Gray
Davis said he would refund the money.
</P>
<P>
   Despite agreement in the Legislature that the money should be
refunded, disputes about details have kept the bills stalled in
committees.
</P>
<P>
   ``Four months after a meeting of the minds on this issue, we are
finally returning the money we had no legal right to take in first
place,'' Assemblyman Tom McClintock, R-Northridge, said during
debate on one of the bills last week.
</P>
<P>
   McClintock had originally sponsored a bill to refund the money,
but it was killed and the task divided into two bills by Democratic
lawmakers in tough re-election battles, Sen. Betty Karnette and
Assemblyman Alan Lowenthal, both of Long Beach.
</P>
<P>
   Davis has said he will sign the bills and put $650 million in
his budget to pay for the refund.
</P>
<P>
   Once he does, anyone who has paid the $300 fee can expect to
receive notice that it will be refunded.
</P>
<P>
   The bills call for the checks to be issued by the Department of
Motor Vehicles, a technicality that allows Davis to reap the
publicity of signing the checks if he chooses. State checks are
usually signed by Davis' rival, state Controller Kathleen Connell.
</P>
<P>
   McClintock warned that the state is wasting more money every day
of delay.
</P>
<P>
   ``In addition to the moral delay, we are losing $14.5 million in
interest,'' he said.''
</P>
<P>
   Several lawmakers warned against making similar errors in the
weeks ahead. When the smog impact fee was passed at the end of a
legislative session more than 10 years ago, the Legislature's own
lawyer warned that it was illegal.
</P>
<P>
   ``As we think about voting on legislation over the next week,
let's make sure that we don't do another dumb mistake like the bill
in 1990 _ one that takes 10 years to undo,'' said Assemblyman Bill
Leonard, R-Rancho Cucamonga.

   The Assembly bill passed 79 to 0, and the Senate bill passed 38
to 0.

 2 ALASKA AIRLINES PILOTS FACE DISMISSALS OVER SAFETY  &HT;     By HENRY K. LEE 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Alaska Airlines said Tuesday that it plans to fire two pilots
for continuing a flight from Portland, Ore., to San Jose in March
with oxygen masks deployed after they failed to pressurize the
Boeing 737 jet.
</P>
<P>
   The pilots jeopardized the lives of passengers and should have
turned back to Portland when the problem began only 30 minutes into
the flight, an airline safety expert said.
</P>
<P>
   Capt. Michael Alan Reese, 56, of Long Beach, Calif., and First
Officer Vincent Emile Danet, 38, of San Diego were told of the
airline's ``intent to terminate'' them at a hearing that capped an
extensive airline investigation, Alaska officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The action will not be made final for 30 to 45 days under a
collective bargaining agreement between the airline and the pilots'
union, the Air Line Pilots Association.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Aviation Administration also is investigating
whether the pilots, who could not be reached for comment Tuesday,
should have their licenses suspended.
</P>
<P>
   When they took off from Portland, the pilots allegedly failed to
activate cockpit switches to pressurize the plane.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Wallin, 49, a man from Portland, Ore., who was on the
flight, said the first sign of something wrong came just a
half-hour into the 90-minute trip. He said his ears popped and the
oxygen masks then came down.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a collective gasp in the plane,'' Wallin recalled
Tuesday. ``I thought that was my last day, and I think that
sentiment was shared by just about everyone for awhile.''
</P>
<P>
   An aviation expert said Tuesday that while forgetting to
pressurize the plane ``does happen,'' the pilots made a far greater
mistake _ and jeopardized passenger safety _ by continuing to San
Jose, because half of the passengers' oxygen canisters were empty
by the end of the flight.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never run into that before,'' Bill Waldock, a professor
at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University in Prescott, Ariz., said of
the pilots' decision to continue. ``If there's no oxygen in there,
you might do OK with somebody that's in good health. But if you
have people with heart or other health problems to begin with, you
could kill them.''
</P>
<P>
   Reese and Danet have been on paid administrative leave since the
incident, the latest in a spate of problems that have plagued the
Seattle-based airline this year, beginning with the January crash
of Flight 261 off the Southern California coast, which killed all
88 people aboard. The crash investigation has focused on mechanical
problems with the airplane's stabilizer.
</P>
<P>
   According to the airline, Flight 506 left Portland at 7:30 a.m.
on March 25 with five crew members and 92 passengers _ including an
infant riding on an adult's lap and former Oregon Gov. Neil
Goldschmidt cq  &LR; _ aboard a new Boeing 737-700.
</P>
<P>
   As the plane headed south, ``somewhere between 10,000 and 14,000
feet, horns sounded in the cockpit,'' Alaska officials said,
without elaborating on the plane's location. At 14,000 feet,
emergency oxygen masks automatically dropped from the ceiling, and
passengers were told to put them on.
</P>
<P>
   After descending to 10,000 feet to pressurize the cabin, the
pilots decided to continue to San Jose at a 41,000-foot cruising
altitude despite requests by flight attendants to return to
Portland, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The airplane landed in San Jose without incident, said Alaska
spokesman Greg Witter. ``I understand some passengers were somewhat
upset by the situation, but I don't believe anyone needed to be
hospitalized,'' Witter said.
</P>
<P>
   The plane then was flown without passengers to Alaska's Seattle
maintenance facility to replenish the oxygen system.
</P>
<P>
   The incident came two months after the crash of Flight 261, amid
ongoing investigations into allegations that Alaska mechanics
falsified safety records.
</P>
<P>
   Allegations by John Liotine, 37, of Pittsburg, Calif., who
formerly worked as a lead mechanic at the airline's Oakland
facility, helped spark in 1998 a federal grand jury investigation
of airline records that earlier this month grew to include the
Flight 261 jet, an MD-80.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, John Young, a mechanic in Seattle, was placed on
leave after speaking to the media about maintenance problems. He is
expected to return to work Friday, Witter said. Both mechanics were
placed on leave to avoid disruptions in the workplace, he said.

 WOMEN DRIVERS, MEN DRIVERS  &HT;     By SCOTT OSTLER 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Two women drove in the Indy 500 Monday, a
historical first.
</P>
<P>
   On lap 74 the women collided, knocking them both out of the
race.
</P>
<P>
   So naturally all the funny guys are calling and sending e-mails
about how the two women drivers were probably putting on makeup or
talking on cell phones.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody mentions the accident-free 73 laps. Or the fact that race
drivers have become such rich, pampered multimedia stars that the
men are just as likely as the women to be putting on makeup while
driving.
</P>
<P>
   Some stereotypes are true, but I'm not sure which would be
worse: Having your car get nudged over the railing of the Bay
Bridge by a woman driver putting on makeup, or by a man driver
putting on his game face _ bringing his hostility and
aggressiveness to a boil to prepare for his day of being a guy.
</P>
<P>
   THAT GIANT Coke bottle at Pac Bell Park, it turns out, is a
metaphor.
</P>
<P>
   The big bottle is empty, and so were the Coke machines at the
Fan Center under the Big Bottle. Gerald White says the machines ran
out Saturday and stayed dry Sunday and Monday.
</P>
<P>
   So instead of kids paying $1 for a Coke in the Fan Center, they
had to go to a regular snack stand and pay $3. Why nobody thought
to transfer some of the sacred Cola to the Fan Center is anybody's
guess.
</P>
<P>
   SOMETIMES I'M right, and when that happens it's important to
point it out.
</P>
<P>
   Lots of e-mail has arrived on a recent reference here to the
bandito in ``Treasure of the Sierra Madre'' saying something about
``any stinking badges.''
</P>
<P>
   Readers pointed out that the bandito said, ``We don't need no
stinking badges.''
</P>
<P>
   I would like to mention that most people who write to inform me
of an error do so with utmost courtesy. Like, ``I love your column,
it is the high point of my day, indeed your prose makes my life
worth living. However, I feel it is important to let you know that
Thomas Jefferson was never a Heisman Trophy winner.''
</P>
<P>
   So it is with the utmost courtesy that I point out that
sometimes famous movie lines become famous and oft-quoted even
though they were never uttered in the movie. In ``Treasure,'' here
is the exact exchange between Humphrey Bogart and the bandito:
</P>
<P>
   Bandito: ``Oiga (listen), senor, we are the federales. You know,
the mounted police.''
</P>
<P>
   Bogie: ``If you're the police, where are your badges?''
</P>
<P>
   Bandito: ``Badges? We ain't got no badges. We don't need no
badges. I don't have to show you any stinking badges.''
</P>
<P>
   After a couple of grammatical mistakes, the bandito caught
himself and got back to his proper English, and history should not
forget that.
</P>
<P>
   BAD HOLIDAY HERE. And as a reader service, consider that if you
order a Gardenburger at an amusement park near closing time, and
the counter kid says, ``Wow, first one of the day,'' that while
that item was sitting around all day waiting for Mr. Nutrition, it
may have been taking on microorganisms until it looked like an
overbooked hayride.
</P>
<P>
   HOW DO you build a competitive baseball team in a ``small''
market like San Francisco?
</P>
<P>
   Doug Wilkins heard Giants' General Manager Brian Sabean, on
KNBR's Ralph &AMP; Tom show, say that the Giants are ``trying to strike
a delicate medium.''
</P>
<P>
   No word of protest yet from the Fortune Teller's Union.
</P>
<P>
   THIS COLUMN is on the record as being in support of cell phone
use in public, as long as certain rules are followed.
</P>
<P>
   No bellowing or theatrical gesturing. No cell conversations
during movies or plays, at church, or during major surgery (this
goes for doctor  &UR; and  &LR; patient).
</P>
<P>
   Add one more cell no-no: Jenefer Bickers heard from a friend who
was on a romantic gondola ride in Venice when the gondolier took a
cell phone call and held an extended conversation.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, woe is mio.
</P>
<P>
   WHO'S GOT TIME for culture these days?
</P>
<P>
   But Carroll Collins and his wife were in Albuquerque and saw a
listing for a play that sounds perfect for the busy dot.commer
hoping to soak up lotsa culture pronto: ``Cat on a Streetcar Named
Iguana.''
</P>
<P>
   ANOTHER BIGGIE for Jerry Springer. The Chronicle's TV listings
capsulized Tuesday's Jerry: ``A wife says she wants to break a
world record by sleeping with 2,000 men in one day.''
</P>
<P>
   Talk is cheap, but seldom  &UR; this  &LR; cheap.
</P>
<P>
   Wonder if Mr. 2,000 will receive a special gift, other than,
obviously, the pride.
</P>
<P>
   And will hubby get in on the, uh, festivities?
</P>
<P>

all that sleep.''

 PACIFIC BELL WILL GET $13 MILLION TAX BREAK  &HT;     By GREG LUCAS  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO _ Democratic state Controller Kathleen Connell cast
the deciding vote Tuesday to give Pacific Bell a $13 million break
on the phone giant's property taxes.
</P>
<P>
   The move by the state Board of Equalization means less property
tax revenues for public schools and cities and counties where the
company has facilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any time you give this type of reduction, there is also a
reduction in service for schools and fire and police protection in
parts of the state where this company has a presence,'' said Johan
Klehs, a board member opposing the lower valuation for Pacific
Bell.
</P>
<P>
   ``A utility shouldn't be getting a break when residential
property owners aren't getting a similar one,'' Klehs said.
</P>
<P>
   Connell said she voted in favor of the tax break because
deregulation of the telephone industry requires the board to change
its way of assessing Pacific Bell.
</P>
<P>
   ``The previous way of calculating value was done in a regulated
environment. Today, the industry is deregulated, and so the old way
of assessing value is no longer valid,'' Connell said.
</P>
<P>
   Pacific Bell's tax boon came as part of the board's annual
determination of the value of each utility operating in California.
</P>
<P>
   The issue is what factors the board should consider in
calculating value.
</P>
<P>
   For the past 10 years, that formula has been set by a court
settlement that expired last year.
</P>
<P>
   Now the board can use whatever formula it chooses to set the
values of Pacific Bell, Pacific Gas and Electric Co. and other
major utilities.
</P>
<P>
   A majority of the board, including Connell, favors setting value
based only on the replacement cost of a utility's physical assets.
</P>
<P>
   The board's staff argued that value should also be based, in
part, on the income generated by a fair market sale or rental of a
utility's property.
</P>
<P>
   The board's staff recommended a value of $14.1 billion for
Pacific Bell. Pacific Bell wanted a value of $12.9 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Connell joined two GOP members of the board in backing the lower
valuation, which will save Pacific Bell about $13 million in
property taxes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were seeking consistency and fairness. We think the
valuation from the board is fair and treats us like other telecom
companies in the state,'' said Bill Mashek, a Pacific Bell
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Mashek said the lower property tax bill for Pacific Bell would
not lead to a rate reduction for customers because the state Public
Utilities Commission, which regulates Pacific Bell, does not use
company costs as a factor in setting rates.
</P>
<P>
   Connell was also the swing vote on a disagreement with PG&AMP;E and
other energy utilities over whether cash reserves to pay federal
tax liability should be partially or totally excluded from the
property tax value of the company.
</P>
<P>
   The board's staff argued that roughly 56 percent of the reserves
should be excluded.
</P>
<P>
   PG&AMP;E and other electrical utilities, including Southern
California Edison and San Diego Gas and Electric, contended that
all the reserves should be totally excluded or the companies would
be overvalued.
</P>
<P>
   Connell agreed with the board staff, eliminating a $4.9 million
property tax break for PG&AMP;E and a $5.4 million tax break for
Southern California's three largest utilities.

CALIFORNIA'S BALD EAGLES COMPETE WITH DEVELOPERS FOR
REMAINING  HABITAT
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By GLEN MARTIN 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAKE NACIMIENTO, Calif. _ Life can be pretty sweet if you're an
eaglet in Central California.
</P>
<P>
   When things go right, you spend your days lollygagging in a
comfy nest as big as a king-size bed, rousing yourself occasionally
to accommodate the gobbets of fresh fish your parents are always
trying to cram down your gullet.
</P>
<P>
   But there can be downsides. Like when your nest lies in the path
of development. Or your more aggressive sibling kicks you out of
the nest and you tumble 100 feet through the canopy of a gray pine,
landing in a heap on a mud bank with a broken leg and two busted
wings.
</P>
<P>
   Both scenarios are playing out here by this sprawling reservoir
in the hills between Highway 101 and the southern Big Sur coast.
And while initially discouraging, both _ in this particular case,
at least _ have happy endings.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, a pair of bald eagles hatched two young in a
lakeside nest they have been using annually since 1995, one of only
seven active bald eagle brood sites in Central California. For the
first two months, both eaglets seemed to prosper.
</P>
<P>
   Then last week, one gave the other the old heave-ho,
demonstrating once again that while nature is very often beautiful,
it is not necessarily pretty.
</P>
<P>
   ``That happens quite a bit, actually,'' said Sal Lucido,
president of the Ventana Wilderness Society, which sponsors
preservation programs for California birds of prey. ``Two or even
three eaglets may hatch in a nest, but often only one makes it to
maturity.''
</P>
<P>
   Happily, the injured eaglet was rescued by local rangers and
rushed to the San Francisco Zoo. It has already undergone one
operation on its leg, and attending veterinarians hope it may
eventually be restored to the wild.
</P>
<P>
   But the larger drama involves more than avian fratricide; it is
about the long-term protection of the bald eagle and its
increasingly fragmented wild habitat in the face of California's
population and development boom.
</P>
<P>
   As in other parts of the state, bald eagle nests in the Big Sur
area were established by releasing birds captured in Alaska and
Canada. These eagles eventually found mates during their annual
migrations to the northern part of the continent; they then
returned to California to nest.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1986, 70 bald eagles have been released in Central
California. And 35 eaglets have been raised to maturity by these
transplanted raptors, creating some optimism for the future of the
species in the central state.
</P>
<P>
   Eagles were nearly eradicated throughout most of North America
in the mid-20th century by gunfire and the widespread use of
pesticides such as DDT, which weakened their eggshells.
</P>
<P>
   DDT was subsequently banned, and not too many people are taking
potshots at eagles anymore; that set the stage for a recovery.
</P>
<P>
   Their comeback during the past 30 years has been so successful
that President Clinton proposed removing them from the federal
endangered species list last year. A final decision on the
delisting is expected in July.
</P>
<P>
   Still, bald eagles have been slow to return in force to
California.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before this program, the last time an eagle nested in this
area was in 1934,'' said Lucido. ``We're making some progress in
bringing them back. We just have to make sure we don't blow it a
second time.''
</P>
<P>
   But what ultimately made a comeback possible, said Jim Davis,
executive director of the society, is something that has long been
reviled as an environmental horror: artificial reservoirs.
</P>
<P>
   Reservoirs may destroy salmon runs and riparian forests, but
eagles love them, Davis said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have everything that bald eagles need,'' said Davis.
``There are perfect nesting trees right next to the water, and the
reservoirs are full of the fish and waterfowl that the eagles like
to eat.''
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't mean California's bald eagles are out of the woods
yet.
</P>
<P>
   They may like reservoirs _ but so do people. Lake Nacimiento is
experiencing a development boom. Vacation homes are sprouting like
pink stucco fungi along the shoreline. Jet skis and cigarette boats
roar across the lake's limpid surface.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the eagles are handling it with equanimity, but it's
obvious they are going to need some long-term protection.
</P>
<P>
   Boaters regularly motor to within a hundred yards of the nest
and are only nominally dissuaded from getting closer by a boundary
line of buoys. And the parade of new homes continues to march up
the shore.
</P>
<P>
   But conservationists are joining with a local rancher to do
something about it.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Irving's family has ranched this land since the 1930s. He
owns 413 acres around the nest, including more than a mile of
shoreline.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess I'm not a Los Angeles-style environmentalist, but I've
always considered myself a preservationist,'' said Irving, who has
the soft manner of speaking and deft movements typical of someone
who has spent his life working with large livestock.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people who are moving up here don't really have the
respect for the land and the sense of community that the old
families had,'' Irving said. ``It's important to me that we save
what we can.''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Irving is negotiating with the Ventana Wilderness
Society and the Big Sur Land Trust to sell the land around the nest
with long-term conservation in mind.
</P>
<P>
   Basically, Irving has given the two groups a long-term option to
buy the land, which has a current market value in excess of
$900,000.
</P>
<P>
   The land trust, which has preserved 19,000 acres of land in and
around Big Sur since 1978, will bring the legal expertise needed to
close the deal, while the society will handle restoration and
management plans.
</P>
<P>
   Nikki Nedeff, director of conservation for the land trust, said
she is optimistic the necessary money can be raised to buy the
property.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is actually a little far afield from our primary mandate,
which is preserving land along the Big Sur coast,'' Nedeff said.
``But bald eagles are a historic part of the Big Sur ecosystem, and
it's essential to protect their nesting sites.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides, said Nedeff, wildland such as that encompassed by
Irving's ranch is becoming increasingly rare in California.
</P>
<P>
   ``This kind of habitat _ upland chaparral with mixed hardwoods
and conifers _ is terribly threatened,'' said Nedeff. ``It's
becoming fragmented, particularly by vineyards and housing tracts.
Eagles thrive in it, but so do a tremendous number of other
wildlife species. We always welcome the chance to save some of
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Lake Nacimiento's lone remaining eaglet is doing its
part to bolster its species _ by growing like a weed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's only been eight weeks since it hatched, but it's already
fully fledged and big as an adult,'' said Davis. ``In another few
weeks, it will be out of here. In a few months, it will have
migrated north, maybe as far as Great Slave Lake in Canada. As long
as we give them the few basics they need, they'll do just fine.''

OZONE HOLE FOUND OVER NORTH POLE 
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVID PERLMAN 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Clouds of ice and acid high in the stratosphere disrupted the
Northern Hemisphere's protective ozone layer this past winter, and
scientists say the ozone loss poses potentially serious health
problems for humans if it repeats in coming winters.
</P>
<P>
   An international team of researchers detected the unusually cold
ozone-destroying clouds in the stratosphere over the Arctic last
winter, and the team's leaders reported their findings Tuesday at a
meeting of the American Geophysical Union in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The findings are surprising because scientists had expected that
the protective ozone layer would recover after ozone-destroying
chemicals known as chlorofluorocarbons, or CFCs, were banned by
international treaty four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   But that has not happened, the team of nearly 200 scientists and
technicians found. Instead, the same phenomenon that has opened a
growing ``ozone hole'' over Antarctica each winter for more than 10
years is occurring over the Arctic Circle as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ozone levels over the Arctic have been dropping for the past
four to five years,'' said Brian Toon, an atmospheric scientist at
the University of Colorado and a leader of the team. ``As a result
the stratosphere over the Arctic is beginning to look a lot like
the Antarctic.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first time, in fact, that we've seen the polar
clouds lasting long enough to affect the ozone layer
significantly,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The ozone loss in the Southern Hemisphere is already causing
health problems for many people in Australia, New Zealand and
elsewhere in the South Pacific because the sun's damaging
ultra-violet radiation is no longer blocked by the layer of ozone.
</P>
<P>
   The same could happen in populated areas of the United States,
Canada and Russia if the Northern Hemisphere's ozone layer
continues to thin, the researchers said.
</P>
<P>
   Using an array of satellites, weather balloons and high-flying
aircraft, the scientists found that polar stratospheric clouds made
of ice particles and nitric acid were larger and lasted longer than
researchers had found in previous years.
</P>
<P>
   The clouds, known as PSCs, generally form about 13 miles above
the poles each winter when temperatures drop to 110 degrees
Fahrenheit below zero, Toon said.
</P>
<P>
   This past winter, he reported, instruments on satellites,
balloons and two high-altitude aircraft all showed that ozone
concentrations in some parts of the stratosphere declined as much
as 60 percent between November and March.
</P>
<P>
   The complex chemistry that caused the loss begins with the
presence of chlorine atoms. Chlorine was released into the
atmosphere for many years in the form of CFCs, which were once
widely used for refrigerators, air-conditioning equipment and many
industrial products.
</P>
<P>
   CFCs were banned in 1996 by a treaty known as the Montreal
Protocol, but they are expected to linger in the upper atmosphere
for many more years, scientists say.
</P>
<P>
   Highly reactive chlorine can destroy ozone molecules on contact,
and it is the nitric acid in the polar clouds that transforms
normally inert chlorine into the form that tears the ozone apart.
This past winter, the researchers found, nitric acid ``drizzled''
down from clouds high up in the stratosphere and turned even more
chlorine than usual into the ozone-destroying form.
</P>
<P>
   Much of what the international team discovered was also
predicted in computer models developed by a separate group of
scientists led by Azadeh Tabazadeh, am atmospheric physicist at the
NASA Ames Research Center in Mountain View, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   The arctic atmosphere is not nearly as cold as it is over
Antarctica, but it has been growing colder over the past 20 years
by more than four degrees Fahrenheit per decade, Tabazadeh said in
an interview last week. Because of this, she said, this past winter
should in fact have seen colder than normal temperatures over the
Arctic, leading in turn to larger and longer-lasting polar
stratospheric clouds.
</P>
<P>
   That is precisely what happened this past winter, and as a
result the nitric acid compounds high in the stratosphere dropped
down to turn the lingering chlorine atoms into ozone destroyers.
</P>
<P>
   ``If our model is correct and if our estimate of the cooling
rate in the stratosphere is correct, than we predict that by 2010
ozone in the (arctic) stratosphere will be decreased by up to 30
percent,'' Tabazadeh said.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, the situation is made worse by heat-trapping gases
that have been linked to global warming.
</P>
<P>
   Toon said the ``greenhouse gases'' in Earth's upper atmosphere
that continually trap heat at the Earth's surface, also act like
radiators to lower temperatures in the stratosphere. As a result,
the icy polar clouds this past winter grew larger and colder and
lasted longer than expected, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Although the clouds of ice and nitric acid particles form high
in the stratosphere directly over the Arctic, their influence on
the protective ozone layer extends far south each spring as they
drift over densely populated areas of the United States, Canada and
Russia.
</P>
<P>
   It is these regions that could see increases in skin cancer
rates and other damaging effects from solar ultraviolet radiation
if the ozone layer thins during future winters as it has now, the
researchers said.
</P>
<P>
   Based in Kiruna, Sweden, this past winter, the international
project was the largest in a series of annual efforts known as the
Stratospheric Aerosol and Gas Experiment. , or SAGE. This winter's
version was termed SOLVE, the SAGE III Ozone Loss and Validation
Experiment. The project included researchers from Canada, Russia,
Japan, and the United States, as well as from several European
organizations.

STOPPED-UP BELFOUR CAN'T STOP NEW JERSEY IN OPENER
</HEADLINE>

c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ Stars goalie Ed Belfour crouched down in
goal, his face expressionless. Only his eyes showed life, shifting
sideways towards Dallas' bench, where seconds later he began to
skate toward.
</P>
<P>
   A little less than 18 minutes remained in Game 1 of the Stanley
Cup Finals but Belfour's portion of Tuesday night's 7-3 humiliating
loss was done. The rest of the Stars weren't so lucky. They had to
wade through the mess they made.
</P>
<P>
   Let's just say the Stars, much like Belfour, had seen better
games.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very embarrassing,'' Stars defenseman Darryl Sydor said.
``We didn't give (Belfour) a good game. That's the bottom line.
It's not Eddie Belfour that lost the game. It's us. We let him
down.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, it was just one of those nights for the defending
champions. Whatever hadn't already gone wrong, they found a way to
screw up. After a solid first period that ended knotted at 1-1, the
meltdown began for the Stars. They allowed six goals in a span of
22 minutes and 21 seconds of the second and third periods.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pretty simple,'' Stars forward Joe Nieuwendyk said. ``We
got outplayed in every area. They played positionally sound as they
always do. We just did not compete for pucks and they took it to us
and we didn't respond.''
</P>
<P>
   How did they get outplayed? Let us count the ways.
</P>
<P>
   Defensively. The Stars usual strength failed them. Sydor and his
defensive partner Sergei Zubov were on the ice for all but one of
the Devils goals.
</P>
<P>
   Offensively. The Stars aren't usually the
light-up-the-scoreboard types, but their impact players practically
disappeared during the stretch where New Jersey scored all of its
goals.
</P>
<P>
   In goal. Dallas usually doesn't allow seven goals in two games
much less two periods. In fact, Colorado failed to score more than
a pair in any of the seven Western Conference Finals games.
Belfour, who brought a 1.81 goals-against average into Tuesday
night's game, allowed six goals on 18 shots.
</P>
<P>
   Belfour said he had been fighting a bit of a cold bug and felt
his decongestant maybe effected his play.
</P>
<P>
   When did he realize the medication was a problem?
</P>
<P>
   ``After six goals,'' Belfour deadpanned. ``It was 6-1, and
things weren't going our way and I think Hitch maybe realized that
it was time to get me out of there. It wasn't going my way and with
the score 6-1 in the third period he decided to get me out of there
and rest.''
</P>
<P>
   And ABC execs were fretting that Devils-Stars lacked
goal-scoring appeal?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nice for some of our guys to start scoring some goals
because they've been hard to come by,'' Devils coach Larry Robinson
said.
</P>
<P>
   Some goals? Hard to come by?
</P>
<P>
   The Devils couldn't miss Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey had talked about needing a good start which Devils
forward Jason Arnott provided with his goal seven minutes and 22
seconds into the Finals.
</P>
<P>
   After the Stars tied it with a goal by Sydor at 13:13 of that
period, their problems began.
</P>
<P>
   The Devils didn't waste any time jumping ahead of the Stars in
the second period either. Defenseman Ken Daneyko squeaked his first
playoff goal in at 2:52 of the second period on a shot that hit the
inside of Belfour's right thigh bounced to his left thigh and in.
</P>
<P>
   ``You saw from the start we didn't have that passion and emotion
for some reason. Why? We don't know,'' Stars winger Mike Keane
said. ``They got a goal and a second goal then a third goal then
things started snowballing.''
</P>
<P>
   Less than 30 seconds after Martin Brodeur's spectacular glove
save on Brett Hull midway through second-period action, Petr Sykora
scored on Belfour to stretch New Jersey's advantage to 3-1. Devils
forward Patrik Elias had a failed breakaway yet passed back to
Sykora.
</P>
<P>
   Follow that aforementioned snowball roll from that point on.
</P>
<P>
   Devils defenseman Scott Stevens scored. After a 17-minute
intermission between periods, New Jersey picked up right where it
had left off. A Sergei Brylin goal followed by another Sykora goal
which led to Belfour's departure.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was my decision to pull him,'' Stars coach Ken Hitchcock
said.
</P>
<P>
   And while Belfour got pulled, all 19 of the other Stars felt his
pain.
</P>
<P>
   ``For sure,'' Sydor said. ``We can't let so many scoring chances
happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Arnott scored his second and New Jersey's seventh against Stars
backup goalie Manny Fernandez.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars hadn't allowed that many goals in a playoff game since
Game 5 of the Western Conference Finals last season, and the pride
started hurting as they were skating around under a scoreboard that
read 7-1.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've played games like this before and the only difference
between 7-3 and 4-3 has been Belfour,'' Hitchcock said. ``We've had
a couple of performances like this and we've always bounced back.''
</P>
<P>
   Dallas' started that long bounce back by getting two goals in a
12-second span later in the third period. Obviously, Kirk Muller's
and Jon Sim's additions were too little, too late. But the Stars
have a lot of pride and they say that's just the beginning.
</P>
<P>
   The Devils believe it, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are going to come out hard, flying and playing dirty
hockey,'' Arnott said. ``No question about it, Eddie Belfour is
going to come out rock solid and I think we got to worry about what
we are going to do out there.''
</P>
<P>
   And the Stars managed to find a silver lining to the cloud
hanging over them.
</P>
<P>
   ``The positive is we're only down by one game,'' Stars winger
Scott Thornton said. ``They didn't get two games for that.''

TOM LIDDY RUNS FOR CONGRESS BUT NOT FROM DAD 
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By KRIS MAYES 
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Spend any time at all with Tom Liddy, one of four Republicans
scrambling for a foothold in the race for the 1st Congressional
District, and you quickly realize that his father, former Watergate
figure G. Gordon Liddy, is never far from his side.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps not literally. The G-Man lives only part time in
Scottsdale and does his nationwide radio show mostly from Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   But there he is in the photographs in the candidate's Tempe
campaign office, standing next to family friend Waylon Jennings.
</P>
<P>
   The Harley-Davidson and Corvette that the 37-year-old sometimes
drives to his fund-raisers are his dad's _ complete with H2O-GATE
license plates.
</P>
<P>
   G. Gordon makes frequent mentions of his son's candidacy, Tom's
first bid for office, on his syndicated radio show, aired on 290
radio stations nationwide, six in Arizona. Tom also runs political
ads on his father's show.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm proud of my parents,'' the younger Liddy said recently
while campaigning in Ahwatukee. ``They wanted my father to testify
against people during Watergate, but he preferred to remain silent.
And for that silence he was sentenced to 21 years in prison. The
guy doesn't lie.''
</P>
<P>
   Tom Liddy, a lawyer for a Phoenix firm, left his post as legal
counsel to the Republican National Committee in Washington, D.C.,
and moved to Arizona in 1998. He moved to Chandler and the 1st
Congressional District nine months ago. &QL; 
In most other states, Liddy might be labeled a carpetbag ger. But
like New York, a state where Hillary Rodham Clinton's campaign has
caught fire despite her newcomer status, Arizona is a place where
being from someplace else is almost a political advantage. John
McCain was one of the first candidates to prove that in 1982 when
he targeted the 1st Congressional District, moved there and won.
</P>
<P>
   Although Liddy has an uphill battle in a race that features
three other skilled Republicans _ former think tank director Jeff
Flake, cable TV executive Susan Bitter Smith and former Phoenix
City Councilman Sal DiCiccio _ experts do not discount Liddy's
candidacy. And they say if Liddy does win the heavily Republican
district, he will have his name to thank.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would seem like Flake is probably the institutional
favorite, but there isn't any reason to think that in an Arizona
Republican primary that the name recognition of someone who is
closely associated with the right wing of the party couldn't pull
an upset,'' said Zachary Smith, a political science professor at
Northern Arizona University. ``Tom Liddy could be a complete
unknown and still win this thing because of the name recognition.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, there can be a downside to being the candidate whose
father, however charismatic, is an avatar of the Nixon era.
</P>
<P>
   At a recent candidates forum, perennial GOP candidate Bert
Tollefson rose to denounce Liddy's lineage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your father was a burglar!'' Tollefson yelled.
</P>
<P>
   Liddy was also faced with a dicey question from a reporter
recently when it was discovered that the candidate's campaign Web
site was linked to his father's, which featured an advertisement
for a calendar of scantily clad women brandishing guns. ``Stacked
and packed!'' the ad read. ``America's most beautiful heavily armed
women.'' Within days, the advertisement for the calendar was
discreetly taken down.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Gordon Liddy is unapologetic about his past and says it has no
bearing on his son's candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's absolutely right,'' the elder Liddy said of Tollefson's
remarks in an interview last week. ``But the fact that I was a
burglar does not mean that Tom is. I don't see how that affects
Tom. Suppose I was a neurosurgeon. Would that make Tom a
neurosurgeon?''
</P>
<P>
   Tom Liddy, who from time to time has acted as his father's
lawyer and continues to represent him in an ongoing lawsuit filed
against him by fellow Watergate figure John Dean, speaks openly
about his father's imprisonment and the effect it had on him, Tom.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a time for my brothers and sisters and I to really rely
on each other for closeness and strength, and it was a time of
great suffering for my mother,'' Liddy said. ``We were impoverished
_ not Ethiopia impoverished, but we ended up $300,000 in debt and
didn't have any new clothes for five years. It humbles you and
makes you grateful for what you have got.''
</P>
<P>
   His father's time in the spotlight may have deprived him of a
father and new clothing for five years, but it gave Tom Liddy a
deftness for dealing with reporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``When (CNN anchor) Bernard Shaw comes into your living room
when you are 12 years old and you are shaking hands with Barbara
Walters, you are not awed by the media circus,'' Liddy said. ``I am
media savvy, as they say.''
</P>
<P>
   Being the son of Gordon Liddy has been beneficial in other ways
as well.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Gordon Liddy has lent his name to several of his son's
fund-raisers, and many of Gordon's friends, including Oliver North
and the late Richard Kleindienst, have helped out. In July, the
candidate will travel to Virginia, where Gordon Liddy and rocker
Ted Nugent will headline a Tom Liddy fund-raising event.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, most of Tom Liddy's fund-raising apparatus is outside
Arizona. According to an analysis by The Republic, 58 percent of
Liddy's contributions have come from donors outside the state,
tying Liddy with Bitter Smith for the title of biggest out-of-state
fund-raiser.
</P>
<P>
   After the most recent campaign finance reporting period, Liddy
reported having only $31,000 in cash on hand, even though he had
raised more than $212,000. By contrast, Flake had raised $237,755
and had more than $200,000 in the bank by mid-April. More than 50
percent of Liddy's campaign donations have flowed to consultants.
</P>
<P>
   Liddy has developed a base of support in the state that includes
McCain's state director, Larry Pike, and his wife, Nicole Bidwill,
the daughter of Cardinals owner Bill Bidwill.
</P>
<P>
   The senior Liddy talks as though his son were the front-runner
in the race rather than a newcomer who has never held office in
Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Tom has only one serious opponent. It's a race between
him and Jeff Flake,'' Liddy said, referring to the East Valley
Republican and former director of the Goldwater Institute. ``Jeff
Flake strikes me as one of these intellectual types. . . . There is
nothing wrong with being an intellectual, but this fellow seems to
think he is just entitled to it because he worked for the Goldwater
Institute.''
</P>
<P>
   ``By the way, he's a hell of a good shot,'' Gordon suddenly
interjected about his son. ``I saw him take a .45, and with one
shot, he took the head right off a snapping turtle.'' (Upon hearing
of his father's comments, Tom remarked dryly, ``Oh, great, that's
going to help me with the women's vote in Tempe.'')
</P>
<P>
   Tom Liddy's accuracy with a deadly weapon and his time spent in
the Marines aside, on the campaign trail the candidate is all
compassionate conservative. At every opportunity, he trumpets the
need to raise teachers salaries and his own experience teaching
seventh grade, which he hopes will help set him apart from his
competitors on what is the defining issue in the suburban
congressional district.
</P>
<P>
   And as he campaigns door to door, Liddy courts Independents, who
will be eligible to vote for the first time in the Sept. 12
Republican primary.
</P>
<P>
   Liddy also appears to be borrowing a page from McCain, talking
about the need for campaign finance reform and a kind of
lay-it-all-out style of governance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a guy who, if he will do anything, will talk straight,''
Liddy said during a recent candidate forum.
</P>
<P>
   And talk tough. At a recent forum, Liddy was the only candidate
who was willing to criticize an opponent whose salary from a
non-profit organization had been paid, in part, by a tax-deductible
donation from his campaign finance chairman.
</P>
<P>
   At a forum in Phoenix two days before Flake relinquished the
post, Liddy used time reserved for his own introduction to take on
Flake.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody knows there is an elephant in this room, and we're
going to talk about it tonight,'' Liddy said.
</P>
<P>
   At another forum hosted by gay Republicans, Liddy noticed that
Flake was absent from the controversial group's meeting and sensed
another opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where is Jeff Flake?'' Liddy asked loudly as the group
assembled. ``Has anybody seen Jeff Flake?'' &QL;

LAPD STEPS UP MANHUNT IN GONZALEZ SLAYING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Amid expressions of shock and grief across the
city, detectives widened the manhunt Tuesday for the killer of
Chief Bernard C. Parks' granddaughter.
</P>
<P>
   The brazen slaying of 20-year-old Lori Gonzalez on Sunday has
rocked members of the Parks family, as they gathered at his home to
mourn. Vice President Al Gore called to offer his condolences.
</P>
<P>
   As Parks made funeral arrangements, at least a dozen elite
detectives from the Robbery-Homicide Division fanned out across the
city in search of the gunman, described only as a heavy-set
African-American in his early 20s, 5 feet 10 inches to 6 feet tall,
with a long face and black, oily hair.
</P>
<P>
   A video surveillance tape from a nearby gasoline station could
provide needed clues as to who walked up next to Gonzalez's car
about 10 p.m. Sunday and fired at a passenger, missing him and
killing her instead.
</P>
<P>
   ``We firmly believe that she was not the intended target,'' said
LAPD Cmdr. Dave Kalish. ``This is a situation where we had a
beautiful young lady who had nothing to do with crime.''
</P>
<P>
   At a makeshift memorial, residents and friends placed a rag
doll, and flowers, and left written eulogies where she was slain,
in front of the Popeyes Chicken restaurant at La Brea Avenue and
Jefferson Boulevard.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez had been visiting friends and her mother, Felicia, in
Los Angeles after leaving Saddleback College in Mission Viejo where
she majored in English.
</P>
<P>
   Police identified the passenger as a 20-year-old longtime
acquaintance of Gonazlez.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's obviously pretty devastated by the incident. The
interviews with him have been pretty slow,'' said department
spokesman Lt. Horace Frank. ``We're not ruling anything out.''
</P>
<P>
   Councilman Nate Holden announced he would seek a $25,000 reward
to help track the killer but backed away at the urging of police.
</P>
<P>
   ``They thought a reward being noted at this time would interfere
with the investigation,'' Holden said. ``They were pretty emphatic
about it. I got the impression that they were onto someone.''
</P>
<P>
   Investigators urged anyone with information to call a tip line.
Some residents of the neighborhood said they already have told
police about seeing the attack and hearing shots.
</P>
<P>
   A 16-year-old girl who lives near the restaurant said she saw a
man run from the scene of the shooting shortly after hearing
several gunshots.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw him run up to the car,'' said the teen-ager, who asked
that her name be withheld because she fears retaliation. ``Then I
heard gunshots. I couldn't really see his face. He was wearing dark
clothes. But I saw him run into the alley. It was scary.''
</P>
<P>
   She said she called 911 to report the attack and spoke with
detectives Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Another woman said her teen-age son was in the area when
gunshots erupted, so she bolted out the door to find him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw him down the street,'' she said. ``He was waving his
arms and saying, `Here I am. I knew you'd come after me ...'''
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time he steps outside, I'm like, Oh gosh, I hear
something,'' she said. ``I'm tired of doing that.''
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez was fatally shot just a day after someone stabbed to
death a 90-year-old community leader, Albert Patton, and his
85-year-old wife, who uses a wheelchair, in their home a few blocks
away.
</P>
<P>
   According to Los Angeles police statistics, violent crimes in
that neighborhood have risen about 6 percent this year over last.
As of May 21, there were 13 homicides in the Southwest Division,
identical to the same time period last year. But rapes, robberies
and aggravated assaults have all risen this year over last.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Ken Deasy of St. Agatha's Parish Family Church, several
blocks away from where the shooting took place, said he was
disappointed because he and community members have been working to
make the streets safer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had two years of cultural exchange repairs, gangs have
gone down, blacks and Latinos are getting along, and we're getting
more whites to come in to live here,'' he said. ``Then this
happens. I really see this as disappointing. I hope no one from our
area (did) ... this.''
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles police homicide Detective Brian Carr said extra
detectives were assigned to the case because of the number of tips
generated by the prominence of the victim.
</P>
<P>
   ``That generates a lot of leads. It's not playing favorites for
the chief. If Joe Schmoe got the same media attention, we'd do the
same thing,'' Carr said.
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles City Council adjourned its meeting in memory of
Gonzalez, and council members offered their sympathy to the police
chief and his family.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very hard-hitting loss, not only to the family and the
people who knew her, but for the rest of the city to realize that
these kinds of tragedies can occur to anyone,'' said Councilwoman
Laura Chick.
</P>
<P>
   The Police Protective League, which has gone head to head at
times with Parks, sent a letter of condolence.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no secret that we have differences of opinion with the
management style of LAPD, but ... when a tragedy like this occurs,
we set everything aside to grieve with the grieving family,'' said
Ted Hunt, president of the league.
</P>
<P>
   Funeral services are tentatively set for Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Parkses are a very close family, a loving family. They are
together now. This is a real tough time for them,'' Kalish said.
</P>
<P>
   Detectives ask that anyone with information about the slaying
call them at (213) 485-2129 or (213) 485-2504 after hours.

   The brazen slaying of 20-year-old Lori Gonzalez on Sunday has
rocked members of the Parks family, as they gathered at his home to
mourn. Vice President Al Gore called to offer his condolences.
</P>
<P>
   As Parks made funeral arrangements, at least a dozen elite
detectives from the Robbery-Homicide Division fanned out across the
city in search of the gunman, described only as a heavy-set
African-American in his early 20s, 5 feet 10 inches to 6 feet tall,
with a long face and black, oily hair.
</P>
<P>
   A video surveillance tape from a nearby gasoline station could
provide needed clues as to who walked up next to Gonzalez's car
about 10 p.m. Sunday and fired at a passenger, missing him and
killing her instead.
</P>
<P>
   ``We firmly believe that she was not the intended target,'' said
LAPD Cmdr. Dave Kalish. ``This is a situation where we had a
beautiful young lady who had nothing to do with crime.''
</P>
<P>
   At a makeshift memorial, residents and friends placed a rag
doll, and flowers, and left written eulogies where she was slain,
in front of the Popeyes Chicken restaurant at La Brea Avenue and
Jefferson Boulevard.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez had been visiting friends and her mother, Felicia, in
Los Angeles after leaving Saddleback College in Mission Viejo where
she majored in English.
</P>
<P>
   Police identified the passenger as a 20-year-old longtime
acquaintance of Gonazlez.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's obviously pretty devastated by the incident. The
interviews with him have been pretty slow,'' said department
spokesman Lt. Horace Frank. ``We're not ruling anything out.''
</P>
<P>
   Councilman Nate Holden announced he would seek a $25,000 reward
to help track the killer but backed away at the urging of police.
</P>
<P>
   ``They thought a reward being noted at this time would interfere
with the investigation,'' Holden said. ``They were pretty emphatic
about it. I got the impression that they were onto someone.''
</P>
<P>
   Investigators urged anyone with information to call a tip line.
Some residents of the neighborhood said they already have told
police about seeing the attack and hearing shots.
</P>
<P>
   A 16-year-old girl who lives near the restaurant said she saw a
man run from the scene of the shooting shortly after hearing
several gunshots.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw him run up to the car,'' said the teen-ager, who asked
that her name be withheld because she fears retaliation. ``Then I
heard gunshots. I couldn't really see his face. He was wearing dark
clothes. But I saw him run into the alley. It was scary.''
</P>
<P>
   She said she called 911 to report the attack and spoke with
detectives Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Another woman said her teen-age son was in the area when
gunshots erupted, so she bolted out the door to find him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw him down the street,'' she said. ``He was waving his
arms and saying, `Here I am. I knew you'd come after me ...'''
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time he steps outside, I'm like, Oh gosh, I hear
something,'' she said. ``I'm tired of doing that.''
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez was fatally shot just a day after someone stabbed to
death a 90-year-old community leader, Albert Patton, and his
85-year-old wife, who uses a wheelchair, in their home a few blocks
away.
</P>
<P>
   According to Los Angeles police statistics, violent crimes in
that neighborhood have risen about 6 percent this year over last.
As of May 21, there were 13 homicides in the Southwest Division,
identical to the same time period last year. But rapes, robberies
and aggravated assaults have all risen this year over last.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Ken Deasy of St. Agatha's Parish Family Church, several
blocks away from where the shooting took place, said he was
disappointed because he and community members have been working to
make the streets safer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had two years of cultural exchange repairs, gangs have
gone down, blacks and Latinos are getting along, and we're getting
more whites to come in to live here,'' he said. ``Then this
happens. I really see this as disappointing. I hope no one from our
area (did) ... this.''
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles police homicide Detective Brian Carr said extra
detectives were assigned to the case because of the number of tips
generated by the prominence of the victim.
</P>
<P>
   ``That generates a lot of leads. It's not playing favorites for
the chief. If Joe Schmoe got the same media attention, we'd do the
same thing,'' Carr said.
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles City Council adjourned its meeting in memory of
Gonzalez, and council members offered their sympathy to the police
chief and his family.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very hard-hitting loss, not only to the family and the
people who knew her, but for the rest of the city to realize that
these kinds of tragedies can occur to anyone,'' said Councilwoman
Laura Chick.
</P>
<P>
   The Police Protective League, which has gone head to head at
times with Parks, sent a letter of condolence.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no secret that we have differences of opinion with the
management style of LAPD, but ... when a tragedy like this occurs,
we set everything aside to grieve with the grieving family,'' said
Ted Hunt, president of the league.
</P>
<P>
   Funeral services are tentatively set for Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Parkses are a very close family, a loving family. They are
together now. This is a real tough time for them,'' Kalish said.
</P>
<P>
   Detectives ask that anyone with information about the slaying
call them at (213) 485-2129 or (213) 485-2504 after hours.

FEDS HOPE TO EASE FOREST FIRE THREAT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JUDD SLIVKA  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Federal officials may close thousands of acres of Arizona
national forest as soon as next week to reduce the chances of a
disastrous fire season.
</P>
<P>
   The affected forests would be those on or close to the Mogollon
Rim _ the Apache-Sitgreaves, Coconino, Kaibab, Tonto and Prescott
national forests, all of which have had active fires in the past
month.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in the `Yes, but when and where?' part now,'' Conny
Frisch, supervisor of the Kaibab National Forest, said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're asking, `Do we have the money to do this?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Forest officials said that June 7 is their target date for
closures, but that they may leave areas of &QL; 
pinon-juniper open to the public because they don't burn as quickly
as the ponderosa pine at higher elevations.
</P>
<P>
   The closures could rival 1996, when nearly 4 million acres in
national forests were closed to the public because of fire danger.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to explore with other forests going for statewide
closures,'' Frisch said. ``We'd like to all do it at once.''
</P>
<P>
   A decision should be made by Thursday, she said. If the closure
does not encompass all forests _ the rainless winter has left
little grass to burn in the lower elevations _ individual forest
management can decide if and how much to close.
</P>
<P>
   There already are fire restrictions at all national forests and
on state and federal lands. Parts of the Apache-Sitgreaves, Kaibab
and Tonto national forests have been closed to the public for
several weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Keeping the public out of wild lands is neither easy nor cheap,
officials said. But it becomes a human-resources battle.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're at the point now where the entire nation is tipped
towards the Southwest,'' said Karen Malis-Clark, a Coconino
spokeswoman. ``Anyone who supports firefighting activity in the
country is coming to New Mexico and Arizona.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet the state's firefighting resources are nearly tapped out. On
the Kaibab, two large fires have sucked up many of the area's
resources.
</P>
<P>
   At the Coconino, the now-extinguished ``Clover'' fire took up
resources, and when that fire was mostly contained, many of the
engines and crews fighting it were transferred to the Kaibab fires.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Vultee'' fire near Slide Rock State Park this past weekend
strained resources still more, and although that fire is mostly
controlled, the personnel and equipment originally assigned to it
are now being sent to a fast-growing blaze north of Pecos, N.M.
</P>
<P>
   Widespread closures, officials say, would cut down on new
blazes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to limit the human starts,'' Frisch said. ``We
know that we get some lighting starts, but we know that there was
no lightning in Sycamore Canyon and Oak Creek Canyon (sites of two
recent fires). So we're trying to limit that part of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Especially after the holiday weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had people in the forest lighting fires all weekend,'' she
said. ``Our fire-prevention people had their hands full.''
</P>
<P>
   Calling even more attention to Arizona's cotton-dry, brush-heavy
conditions Tuesday, Gov. Jane Hull kicked off a daylong session
among the state's fire managers by alluding to the four major fires
in New Mexico so far this year _ and categorically stating Arizona
is next.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever is raging in New Mexico will soon be raging here,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Holding her arm above her waist, Hull said, ``I'm not the expert
you are, but I know when there is brush up to here, we have a
tinderbox.'' &QL;

THERE'S SIMPLY NO EXCUSE FOR STARS' FAILURE TO COMPETE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY GALLOWAY 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ Of all things that might have happened,
and for all the wrong reasons, the Dallas Stars were guilty of the
absolute worst Tuesday night. They failed to compete.
</P>
<P>
   Lifeless lumps in uniforms did show up and go through the
formality of a Game 1 defense of that prized possession they earned
a year ago _ the Stanley Cup. But it was 60 minutes of mere
pretending. That was obvious.
</P>
<P>
   This was not about losing a game. This was all about a failure
to compete at the same energized level as the New Jersey Devils,
leading to rampant national embarrassment and disgrace for the
Stars. And speaking of embarrassment, how about those fretting
folks from such networks as ABC and ESPN, who made no secret of
their displeasure with these two teams being in the Stanley Cup
Finals.
</P>
<P>
   Worried over ratings, the TV types were forecasting two weeks of
boring, low-scoring, defensive struggles. At least the Stars'
dismal performance shut up the talking heads.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, this 7-3 shocker had plenty to do with Eddie Belfour coming
apart in goal, which more than anything that happened Tuesday night
will privately rattle the confidence of the Stars. But there were
certainly a multitude of Dallas witnesses to the Belfour wreck,
including defensemen Sergei Zubov. who had an upclose view of
Eddie's sudden crackup.
</P>
<P>
   Zubov was on the ice for five of the six goals given up by
Belfour before Ken Hitchcock benched his goalie three minutes into
the third period.
</P>
<P>
   If New Jersey is this dominant, particularly the No. 1 line of
Petr Sykora-Patrik Elias-Jason Arnott, then this series will be
over in four games. Speed-wise, the Stars were no match for that
threesome. ``But it wasn't just the Sykora line,'' added Hitchcock.
``As a group their forwards gave us more speed and quickness than
we've seen this season from any team.''
</P>
<P>
   Publicly, Hitchcock was not in an angry mood afterwards. Neither
was general manager Bob Gainey, who watched every second from the
press box, calmly waited for the celebrating Continental Airlines
Arena crowd to dance out of the building, then said on departing,
``we've got 48 hours to recapture our energy and try to come up
with a new game plan.''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Hitchcock shrugged and said, ``We've had these
kind of games before this (in the playoffs), but the difference in
4-3 and 7-3 has been Belfour. Tonight, Eddie didn't have a good
game.''
</P>
<P>
   Someone mentioned to Hitchcock that his team didn't seemed to
have recovered from the grueling series against the Avalanche,
particularly the Game 7 win on Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this being an extension from Game 7 is irrelevant,''
answered Hitchcock. Amen.
</P>
<P>
   There are no excuses for opening a Stanley Cup Finals and
failing to compete on the same level as the opposition. Unless, of
course, the Devils are this much better than the Stars, which would
shock the hockey world and all odds-makers in Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   What happened to the Stars on Tuesday night was a duplicate of
Game 3 of the Western Conference Finals, which the Avalanche won,
2-0. Except Belfour played outstanding in holding the score down.
The remainder of the team did the lifeless-lump impersonation that
night. The Game 3 in the Edmonton series was much the same.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've seen this,'' repeated Hitchcock. ``We were flat and a
step late, and some of our best people were the ones who were late.
Then the game turned on the third goal (by New Jersey).''
</P>
<P>
   Truthfully, the Stars quit after the Devils made it 3-1 in the
second period. There was a bang-bang-bang sequence in the period
when a quick whistle took away a goal by Guy Carbonneau that would
have tied the game at 2-2. Then Devils goalie Martin Brodeur
rescued his team with a fine save on a Mike Modano wrister,
followed quickly by a terrific glove save as Brett Hull attempted
to slam home the rebound on the Modano shot.
</P>
<P>
   With no penalty whistles through almost two periods, the
end-to-end action went the other way, but this time Elias set up
Sykora for that third goal as Belfour failed to close off the side
of the net. At 3-1, the Stars appeared to be waiting on Thursday
night's Game 2. They promptly retreated.
</P>
<P>
   The optimist _ if he's really drunk _ will say the Stars now
have the Devils right where they want them. Within a year, the
Stars have lost four straight Game 1s in the Western Conference
Finals and the Stanley Cup Finals. But they have yet to lose a
series.
</P>
<P>
   There is, however, no comparing the other three to Tuesday
night. This was a failure to compete. This was even their goalie
folding up. This was, by far, the worst and the most troubling.

EDDIE THE ANGEL'S NIGHT OFF TOO UNUSUAL TO WORRY ABOUT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GIL LeBRETON 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ And before the seventh goal, Eddie
Belfour rested.
</P>
<P>
   And we saw that this was good. Real good. Almost merciful.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody ever said, of course, that the Angel Eddie was
infallible. For months he has been the rock that the defending
Stanley Cup champions have leaned on.
</P>
<P>
   But what in the Devils' name was this?
</P>
<P>
   Belfour stood there, alone in his team's end, while the New
Jersey Devils celebrated and the arena howled. He had just given up
his sixth goal of the night, and there wasn't a teammate defenseman
or a hotel security guard to put a headlock on.
</P>
<P>
   His shoulders slumped a little, and there was no need to argue
with what was about to happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was my decision to pull him,'' coach Ken Hitchcock said,
after the 7-3 lashing that his Stars had just absorbed. ``He hasn't
had too many nights like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Into the game came Manny Fernandez, who, rumor has it, is the
Stars' backup goaltender. Belfour's night ended with almost 17
minutes still to play.
</P>
<P>
   Through 17 previous playoff games, Belfour had allowed only 31
goals _ less than two per game. He had stood up to the likes of
Doug Weight, Owen Nolan and Peter Forsberg.
</P>
<P>
   He had survived jeering, chanting audiences in Edmonton, San
Jose and Denver. And he had stood tall amid the pressure of a Game
7 against the Avalanche.
</P>
<P>
   But the Stars themselves already know all that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eddie didn't have a good night,'' Hitchcock assessed, grimly.
``He's had great nights throughout the playoffs. I know he'll
bounce back.''
</P>
<P>
   You'd think so. Hitchcock knows that recent history is on his
side. The Stars sleep-walked through the finals opener a year ago _
losing at home, even _ yet bounced back to win four of the next
five. There were too many guys in dark jerseys Tuesday night _ guys
with Stanley Cup rings _ having too ghastly of a night.

<P>
   (UNDATED) _ Driving for long periods can cause more than frayed
nerves. Scientists have found sitting behind the wheel can also
result in falling sperm counts.
</P>
<P>
   The testicles of male drivers heat up enough to have an impact
on sperm production, and researchers believe the findings explain
why the wives of taxi and truck drivers find it harder to conceive
than the partners of casual drivers.
</P>
<P>
   But the discovery that the scrotum can heat up by as much as
35.6 degrees Fahrenheit (2 Celsius) after a couple of hours behind
a wheel is unlikely to account for the decline in sperm counts seen
in Western men over the past half century.
</P>
<P>
   Studies have shown sperm counts falling by 1.5 to 3 percent a
year. Tighter underwear or a more sedentary lifestyle is unlikely
to account for such a large decrease, scientists believe.
</P>
<P>
   A study led by Louis Bujan at the Male Fertility Research Group
at Hospital La Grave in Toulouse, France, showed scrotal
temperatures rise significantly in male drivers, accounting for at
least some of the loss of male fertility.
</P>
<P>
   Previous work has shown that sperm production depends on the
testicles remaining cooler than the rest of the body, leading
scientists to propose sitting for hours at a time can lead to a
fall in sperm quantity.
</P>
<P>
   The scientists say in the journal Human Reproduction: ``The
increase in scrotal temperatures observed in the present study in
men driving cars could be one of the strongest pieces of evidence
to explain the longer time required to achieve conception in men
who are occupational drivers.''
</P>
<P>
   Stewart Irvine, a specialist in male fertility at the
Reproductive Biology Unit in Edinburgh, said higher scrotal
temperatures are unlikely to be the main cause of the wider decline
in sperm counts. &QL;

<P>
   He is right, of course. It is just a shame that it took so long
for the obvious to be said out loud.
</P>
<P>
   In an exclusive interview with The Independent, Kofi Annan, the
United Nations' secretary general, pointed to the undeniable fact
that, too often, U.N. troops need a tougher mandate and better
hardware.
</P>
<P>
   It is too easy for U.N. peacekeeping troops to be used by the
world's politicians as mere fig leaves, covering up the fact that
nobody wants to do anything serious at all.
</P>
<P>
   During the war in Bosnia, U.N. peacekeeping troops were
permitted to do little except smile sweetly _ even if crimes were
committed under their very noses _ unless they themselves were
being shot at.
</P>
<P>
   It was a recipe for disaster _ as, for example, at Srebrenica,
where 6,000 people were massacred while Dutch U.N. troops, hampered
by lack of international support, stood by.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations can only take tough action if the powerful
Security Council votes in favor. Thus, huge responsibility lies
with the permanent members of the Security Council, most notably
the U.S., France and Britain, each of which can ensure that action
is blocked.
</P>
<P>
   But the secretary general's leadership is important, too.
Annan's predecessor, Boutros Boutros-Ghali, was notoriously more
interested in playing office politics in New York than in helping
to right the wrongs of the world.
</P>
<P>
   Annan, by contrast, has taken on some of the trickiest
diplomatic tasks imaginable _ successfully negotiating, for
example, with the Iraqi dictator, Saddam Hussein, and with his
Libyan counterpart, Colonel Muammar Qaddafi _ while continuing to
ensure that the U.N. conceals an iron fist in its velvety glove.
</P>
<P>
   Sierra Leone has proved a humiliation for the U.N., with 500 of
its troops being taken hostage by the lawless rebels of the
Revolutionary United Front. The bandit force made a mockery of the
theoretically powerful U.N. force.
</P>
<P>
   The arrival of well-equipped British troops has made things
better for the moment, though Annan is understandably wary lest
Britain pull out again soon. He noted the core problem
internationally: ``The capacity is out there; but the will is not
there to go in.''
</P>
<P>

<P>
   He is right, of course. It is just a shame that it took so long
for the obvious to be said out loud.
</P>
<P>
   In an exclusive interview with The Independent, Kofi Annan, the
United Nations' secretary general, pointed to the undeniable fact
that, too often, U.N. troops need a tougher mandate and better
hardware.
</P>
<P>
   It is too easy for U.N. peacekeeping troops to be used by the
world's politicians as mere fig leaves, covering up the fact that
nobody wants to do anything serious at all.
</P>
<P>
   During the war in Bosnia, U.N. peacekeeping troops were
permitted to do little except smile sweetly _ even if crimes were
committed under their very noses _ unless they themselves were
being shot at.
</P>
<P>
   It was a recipe for disaster _ as, for example, at Srebrenica,
where 6,000 people were massacred while Dutch U.N. troops, hampered
by lack of international support, stood by.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations can only take tough action if the powerful
Security Council votes in favor. Thus, huge responsibility lies
with the permanent members of the Security Council, most notably
the U.S., France and Britain, each of which can ensure that action
is blocked.
</P>
<P>
   But the secretary general's leadership is important, too.
Annan's predecessor, Boutros Boutros-Ghali, was notoriously more
interested in playing office politics in New York than in helping
to right the wrongs of the world.
</P>
<P>
   Annan, by contrast, has taken on some of the trickiest
diplomatic tasks imaginable _ successfully negotiating, for
example, with the Iraqi dictator, Saddam Hussein, and with his
Libyan counterpart, Colonel Muammar Qaddafi _ while continuing to
ensure that the U.N. conceals an iron fist in its velvety glove.
</P>
<P>
   Sierra Leone has proved a humiliation for the U.N., with 500 of
its troops being taken hostage by the lawless rebels of the
Revolutionary United Front. The bandit force made a mockery of the
theoretically powerful U.N. force.
</P>
<P>
   The arrival of well-equipped British troops has made things
better for the moment, though Annan is understandably wary lest
Britain pull out again soon. He noted the core problem
internationally: ``The capacity is out there; but the will is not
there to go in.''
</P>
<P>
   This soft-spoken Ghanaian is aware that to stand by while Sierra
Leone spirals downward into violent chaos merely paves the way for
a repeat performance elsewhere in the not very distant future.
</P>
<P>
   Somewhere, a line must be drawn. For that, the U.N. needs the
support of the major Western powers. Annan says: ``We will test
them.''
</P>
<P>
   For everybody's sake, we must hope that they pass the test. &QL;

   (UNDATED) _ You've heard of a laptop keyboard but how about
making your lap into a keyboard?
</P>
<P>
   Wait a year or so: Electrotextiles, a British company, has
developed a way of including conductive fibers in cloth to produce
a keyboard that can be rolled up or even knitted into clothes, with
the bonus of ties that can act as a mouse.
</P>
<P>
   The company, based in Buckinghamshire, England, is speaking to a
number of companies in Europe and the U.S. about developing the
system, which with the advent of mobile computing could be the
ideal way to carry a keyboard.
</P>
<P>
   Forecasts suggest the number of handheld devices will explode
over the next five years, but with voice recognition still
requiring too much computing power, and keyboards taking up too
much space, the devices could have limited potential for data entry
away from computers.
</P>
<P>
   ``You need a keyboard which is at a human scale to use with
those devices,'' said Tim Butler, Electrotextiles' sales manager,
who reckons the cloth keyboard could be in production before next
March. ``The cost won't be a commercial impediment; it's just
deciding how much functionality you actually want built into the
cloth.''
</P>
<P>
   The company was started 18 months ago by two art college
graduates who realized the potential of weaving conductive fibers
into insulating material such as nylon, which makes it washable,
ironable and shockproof.
</P>
<P>
   Venture capital companies have expressed interest in funding the
start-up. Among potential applications are an aircraft seat which
could sense too great a pressure build-up at a particular point,
and adjust itself, or a hospital bed which could sense continuous
pressure which might lead to bed sores.
</P>
<P>
   But the first _ and busiest _ market is likely to be for people
on the move who want to have a flexible data entry system.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can make a tie act as a mouse when it's moved over the
keyboard,'' said Butler. ``Or, using the software which decides
what various inputs actually mean, we can reprogram it so the
keyboard just turns into a device where you can draw, and the
drawing will be captured by the computer.'' &QL;

   CHINA-NKOREA (Yanji, China) _ Like hundreds of thousands of
hungry North Koreans have sneaked into neighboring China to find
food, escaping a deadly famine in their homeland. But now, Chinese
police have sharply increased their efforts to expel the North
Koreans living undercover in China, creating a climate of fear
along the border and fueling a potentially explosive international
refugee crisis. The number of ``food migrants'' sent back has at
least doubled this year, up to about 2,000 a month, aid groups on
the border say. By Elisabeth Rosenthal.

   LEBANON-HEZBOLLAH (Bint Jbail, Lebanon) _ After liberating

after the last Israeli soldiers retreated from the rocky hillside
villages that they controlled for nearly 18 years, the business of
keeping the water pumping and the hospitals running for an

   KOREA-MASSACRE-DAILY (Clarksville, Tenn.) _ Edward Daily seemed

Press began investigating reports that the unit he said he was with
had massacred hundreds of South Koreans nearly 50 years ago, Daily,
69, seemed an ideal guide. The story led to a Pulitzer for the AP
and the unmasking of Daily. As the Army and other reporters began
to study the records, it became clear that Daily was neither the
war criminal nor war hero he claimed to be. He was never at the
scene of the massacre or even with the unit. And interviews with
veterans show that Daily, while developing his books, may have
airbrushed himself into their memories of the war. By Michael Moss.

whom to meet so as to ensure that his company is next among the
dozens of insurers who have applied for a license to do business in
China. In China's murky business world, where market access depends
on whom you know and how happy you have made them _ though no one
will tell you who those people are. Instead, chief executives like
Sternberg operate on supposition and hearsay to identify the hidden
decision makers and cultivate ``top of mind,'' which means making
their company the first that Chinese leaders think of when

   BARCLAYS-AD-COLUMN (London) _ Barclays PLC, the British bank, is
in the midst of a very big cost-cutting program that at the very
least will make the 300-year-old financial institution smaller; it
just closed 172 branches. Matthew Barrett, the bank's new chief
executive, is hoping that by having a big brand, with the big reach
of the Internet _ where he thinks most consumers will bank in the
future _ he can counter the effect of the branch closings. The new

promising future who taught Bible study classes for children.
</P>
<P>
   Bright, attractive, hard-working and caring, Gonzalez, the
granddaughter of Police Chief Bernard C. Parks, had left her
community college in Mission Viejo just a few weeks ago to visit
her parents and friends in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday night, she was killed at a Popeyes Chicken
drive-through restaurant in the Jefferson Park area of South Los
Angeles by bullets police said were intended for a man described as
an acquaintance.
</P>
<P>
   Family members and friends said Gonzalez chose her friends
carefully.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's devastating. Everyone's in shock. I think everybody can't
believe this has happened,'' said the Rev. Eric Nachtrieb,
Gonzalez's pastor and a spokesman for her grieving family.
</P>
<P>
   She had three semesters behind her at Saddleback College. In
recent weeks, she was training for an entry-level job at Pacific
Bell.
</P>
<P>
   Nachtrieb called Gonzalez ``one of the key leaders'' of a
ministry serving children at Coast Hills Community Church in Aliso
Viejo. She regularly attended church with her father, Joe, and her
stepmother, Debbie. Each Sunday morning, she taught a group of
about 15 children, reading them Bible stories, leading them in
group singing, and introducing them to religious crafts.
</P>
<P>
   She also participated in mission trips to Mexico, where she and
other church members would build homes for disadvantaged children,
her pastor said.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was very warm, loving and friendly,'' he said. ``It was
not uncommon to see her on the floor with a couple kids in her lap.
She was very faithful with the kids and they loved her.''
</P>
<P>
   For the past year, Gonzalez had lived with her father in Mission
Viejo.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was really sad to hear what happened. It really hit me this
morning,'' said Goy Casillas, vice principal of Redondo Union High
School, where Gonzalez graduated in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was a very bright, genuine young lady who worked hard. She
was attractive and had a very nice, open personality. She was a
person who you could make friends with very easily,'' Casillas
recalled without a pause.
</P>
<P>
   When Gonzalez attended the Redondo Beach high school, she lived
mostly with her mother in the beachside community south of Los
Angeles. But about two months before she was set to graduate, she
moved down to Mission Viejo to be with her father. Her parents have
been divorced for 18 years and shared custody of their daughter,
family friends said.
</P>
<P>
   ``She moved, but she really wanted to graduate from Redondo,''
Casillas said. And she did.
</P>
<P>
   Administrators from the two schools allowed Gonzalez to finish
her Redondo Union classes in Mission Viejo. At the end of the year,
she returned to Redondo Beach and walked in the graduation line
with her friends and former classmates, Casillas said.
</P>
<P>
   Those who knew Gonzalez from high school - including teachers,
administrators and even a campus security guard - said she was a
hard-working student who volunteered to be a teacher's assistant
and enrolled in the Marine Corps ROTC program for a little more
than a year.
</P>
<P>
   Since the summer of 1999, Gonzalez attended Saddleback College,
where she majored in English. Gonzalez was close to completing a
three-week training program to be a Pacific Bell operator in
Anaheim. She previously worked at a Sav-On Drug Store in Mission
Viejo after becoming a beautician.

TRAIL BLAZERS DEFEAT LAKERS, 96-88 
</HEADLINE>
   By TOM SPOUSTA   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Using desperation as their sixth man, the Portland
Trail Blazers surprised the Los Angeles Lakers, 96-88, on Tuesday
night at the Staples Center and forced the Western Conference
finals to a Game 6.
</P>
<P>
   The Trail Blazers followed the lead of their two stars, Scottie
Pippen and Rasheed Wallace, who combined to hit the Lakers with a
tenacity that wasn't there while Portland fell behind, three games
to one, in the four-of-seven-game series.
</P>
<P>
   Pippen scored 22 points and had 6 steals and 4 blocked shots.
Wallace had 22 points and 10 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once I set the precedent of being aggressive early, I knew my
teammates would follow,'' said Pippen, who bruised his hand while
landing on the court after a collision with Robert Horry. ``It was
just a matter of making sure we stayed steady and continued that
throughout the game.''
</P>
<P>
   The Trail Blazers turned back every Laker rally and fiercely
protected the 80-67 lead they held through four quarters. Los
Angeles came within 9, at 87-78, with 6 minutes 18 seconds to play,
but got no closer as the Lakers lost for the second time at home in
this series.
</P>
<P>
   With a chance to reach the National Basketball Association
finals for the first time since 1991, the Lakers fell flat on their
jump shots, making only 38 percent. Shaquille O'Neal led Los
Angeles with 31 points and 21 rebounds. Kobe Bryant, playing with
five fouls for most of the fourth quarter, had 17 points.
</P>
<P>
   Glen Rice and Robert Horry combined for 4-of-19 shooting. The
Lakers also made only 6 of 27 3-point attempts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We shot too may 3-point shots,'' Lakers Coach Phil Jackson
said, ``and ended up standing on the perimeter too much trying to
get the ball to Shaq and not finding a way. You have to give
Portland credit for that.''
</P>
<P>
   Portland shot 43 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our defense has been strong this series, except for a few
lapses,'' said Trail Blazers Coach Mike Dunleavy. ``Tonight, we
really didn't have any for a few lapses. Tonight, we really didn't
have any breakdowns. It made a big difference for us.''
</P>
<P>
   After fighting off a 10-point surge by O'Neal, the Trail Blazers
broke down the Lakers late in the third quarter. They finished with
an 8-0 run, sparked by Steve Smith's jump shot and Wallace's two
free throws, before Detlef Schrempf ended the scoring with a layup
and two free throws with 1.3 seconds left following a foul by Rick
Fox.
</P>
<P>
   The Trail Blazers threatened to blow out the Lakers midway
through the third quarter, three times taking 9-point leads. But
O'Neal took charge, scoring 10 straight points and making a
full-court pass to Horry to pull the Lakers within 5, at 70-65,
with 2:30 remaining.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers made a quick 10-5 run early in the third quarter
after Arvydas Sabonis' jump shot gave Portland a 57-47 lead. Bryant
hit a 3-pointer, O'Neal had two baskets and a free throw, and Ron
Harper sank a jumper to pull the Lakers within 5, at 62-57.
</P>
<P>
   The Trail Blazers shot 50 percent in the first half, yet managed
only a 53-45 lead. Pippen, who led Portland with 15 points in the
half, took only one shot in the second quarter, a 3-pointer that
beat the horn and set up a familiar situation for the Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, the Lakers played a mediocre first half, this time
missing 31-of-45 attempts to shoot only 31 percent. Once again,
they stayed within striking range, this time by making 14-of-15
free throws. O'Neal scored 15 points and Bryant had 8 points
despite hitting only 1-of-7 shots. Horry was 0 of 6 and Rice was 1
of 4.
</P>
<P>
   A dunk by O'Neal and two free throws by Bryant cut the Trail
Blazers' lead to 48-45, but a basket by Wallace and Pippen's late
3-pointer lifted Portland's lead back to 8 points. Wallace had 11
points and 7 rebounds in the first half.
</P>
<P>
   As they did in the first halves of Game3 and 4, the Trail
Blazers seized the momentum, and they took an early 10-point lead.
Bonzi Wells hit a 3-pointer and Sabonis followed with a jump shot
to put Portland ahead by 40-30 with 7:21 to play in the second
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal continued his smooth touch at the free-throw line, making
3-of-4 attempts in the first half to go with 9 of 9 from Game 4.
From the field, O'Neal was 6 of 14 with 9 rebounds. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Pippen played a near-flawless first quarter, scored 12 points to
help the Trail Blazers take a 26-24 lead.

FAMILY, FRIENDS MOURN WOMAN WITH PROMISING FUTURE

   LOS ANGELES _ Lori Gonzalez's family and friends mourned the
slain 20-year-old Tuesday, describing her as a young woman with a
promising future who taught Bible study classes for children.
</P>
<P>
   Bright, attractive, hard-working and caring, Gonzalez, the

   &UR; c. 2000, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
LOS ANGELES _ It was the very spotlight under which he has always
felt so uncomfortable, but for a night it bathed him, caressed him,
made him look brighter than all of the Hollywood stars at
courtside.
</P>
<P>
   On this night when the Trail Blazers were fighting for their
playoff lives, it was Scottie Pippen in complete control, a vision
of dogged determination and sleek, fluid athleticism. He was a
velvet hammer, a running, jumping picture of poise, suffering no
mental meltdowns while showing the world all of the talent that is
inside of him in a 96-88 victory.
</P>
<P>
   It was an incredible touch of irony that Pippen should choose
this game and this night to step up and display all of the
leadership skills that Phil Jackson had said it would take for
Portland to triumph. Of course, the Lakers coach had said it in a
goading manner before the start of the series, hoping to put the
pressure on Pippen and then watch him collapse from it.
</P>
<P>
   So Pippen comes out with the Blazers teetering on the brink of
elimination to collect 22 points, six rebounds, six steals, four
blocked shots and three assists. But those are just numbers, and
Pippen was about more than numbers. He was about calm, confidence,
attitude.
</P>
<P>
   In a setting where so many members of the hipster audience
choose to wear their sunglasses indoors, it was Pippen who right
from the start always looked like the coolest cat in the Staples
Center.
</P>
<P>
   He had been fined $10,000 prior to the game for an elbowing and
forearm-exchange incident with the Lakers' John Salley in the final
minutes of the Game 4 loss in Portland. But rather than complain,
Pippen seemed to use that as a motivator, a sign he was willing get
down and dirty, do whatever it takes.
</P>
<P>
   After losing back-to-back games on their home floor and losing
second-half leads both times, the Blazers faced considerable
questions about their pedigree as real title contenders.
</P>
<P>
   Now, after letting an opportunity to close the deal slip through
their hands, the questions will be asked of the Lakers. The
presumed heirs to the throne got 31 points and 21 rebounds out of
Shaquille O'Neal. But the fresh prince of LA, Kobe Bryant,
struggled all night and shot just 4-for-13 before fouling out with
4:45 to play.
</P>
<P>
   It was another game in which the Blazers jumped out fast, and
you always had the feeling the Lakers would make another run. They
did, but they could never get the play that put them over the top.
</P>
<P>
   And through it all, you could never take your eyes off Pippen.
</P>
<P>
   There he was running the Portland offense, pushing the ball up
the court in the transition game, getting it to the proper scorers
in the sets. He knifed through defenders to make tough layups, and
he pulled up in the face of the LA defense with steely nerves to
make clutch jumpers.
</P>
<P>
   There he was at the center of a stellar Blazers defensive
effort, cutting off the passing lanes for his half-dozen steals and
playing spectacular help defense to block his four shots.
</P>
<P>
   There he was diving on the floor for loose balls, even
dislocating a finger on one fall to the floor and never missing a
beat.
</P>
<P>
   It was the kind of big-game performance that fans of the Chicago
Bulls dynasty were used to seeing from Michael Jordan. And maybe
somewhere on the other side of the country, Jordan was watching and
smiling. After all, he had seen much of this before over the years
from Pippen but rarely all together like this and never when all of
the burden was upon him.
</P>
<P>
   Surely Jordan, like the rest of us, watches with interest to
find out if the ultimate second banana on those six NBA
championship teams can pull the wagon by himself. For despite all
of his contributions, those Bulls were always Jordan's team first
and then Jackson's team, never Pippen's.
</P>
<P>
   His track record shows he has played big games before. But what
makes one question whether he is great or just very good has been
an inability to deliver them night after night.
</P>
<P>
   ``Scottie was a warrior out there,'' said Blazers coach Mike
Dunleavy. ``He kept us going in the direction we needed to go and
wouldn't let us waver.''
</P>
<P>
   This was the kind of game and the kind of situation Portland
wanted him for, to hold up the Blazers when their legs were wobbly
and to help Dunleavy dissect the famed triangle offense of the
Lakers that had been brought in from Chicago. To lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just did what I had to do,'' Pippen said.
</P>
<P>
   Which on one evening of desperation was enough to make him the
brightest star in Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   His legacy without Jordan will depend on what happens next.

STORM READY TO WRITE ITS OWN CHAPTER IN SEATTLE SPORTS SCENE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LAURA VECSEY  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ The final practice before showtime for Seattle's
newest pro sports franchise was the stuff of Army boot camp.
</P>
<P>
   It was tough to tell Tuesday whether Storm coach Lin Dunn was
trying to prepare her players for the inaugural season or kill 'em.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't really matter if we're ready,'' Dunn said,
unrelenting in her forward charge into history.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going.''
</P>
<P>
   That's right, Seattle's WNBA expansion team opens its season
Wednesday night in Sacramento, a team loaded with so much talent
there's talk that the Monarchs could knock off the three-time
defending champions from Houston.
</P>
<P>
   We'll wait and see on that one.
</P>
<P>
   Then, ready or not, the Storm make the quick turnaround back up
the coast for Thursday night's home opener in KeyArena against the
Comets.
</P>
<P>
   It may be especially memorable that the Storm will cut its baby
teeth on the likes of Yolanda Griffith, Ruthie Bolton-Holifield and
Ticha Penicheiro of the Monarchs.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it's best that when the lights, cameras, action and hype
kick in at KeyArena in front of what should be a sold-out crowd of
12,969, it's with Sheryl Swoopes, Cynthia Cooper and Tina Thompson
in the house.
</P>
<P>
   Women's basketball turns another page in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think in general it's a great opportunity, another stride,
another step forward for women's basketball, especially here in the
Seattle area,'' said Storm guard Jamie Redd, the all-time scoring
leader from the University of Washington who will make her pro
debut with the Storm.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a fan-based city. They really support sports here,
especially women, and I think it's a great opportunity for this
city, for this team. For me to be a part of it is a great
feeling,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   We all know the first chapters of the women's basketball story.
</P>
<P>
   It started at the University of Washington, where former coach
Chris Gobrecht and her Huskies were reliably compelling enough to
pack Hec Ed.
</P>
<P>
   We were watching when some of that love and loyalty carried over
to the short-lived reign of the Seattle Reign of the American
Basketball League.
</P>
<P>
   Outside of the Bay area, which does not have a WNBA franchise
despite the league's expansion to 16 teams, and outside of
Knoxville (University of Tennessee) or Storrs, Conn. (the OTHER
Husky women), no place in America has been quite so rabid for quite
so long as Seattle is for women's hoops.
</P>
<P>
   ``Seattle is deserving of this, the fans and everything,'' Storm
assistant coach Kathy Anderson said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   A former assistant with the UW women's program, Anderson helped
with stats during Reign games and later became an assistant to
Phoenix Mercury head coach Cheryl Miller.
</P>
<P>
   So Anderson has a keen sense of why this Storm debut is
something for the city to champion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Seattle was one of the first major cities to make women's
basketball go. It may have been the first. I can't think of another
place where women's basketball was accepted in a major city that
did it before Seattle did it,'' Anderson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me, I'm very excited to see all the people who were such a
part of that, who are having the opportunity to see professional
women's basketball.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that this is an entirely Pollyanna-esque proposition.
</P>
<P>
   The WNBA is here because of the NBA's muscle. The ABL was
prevented from expanding its sponsorship and broadcast base by the
strong-arm tactics of the NBA. The grass-roots, player-owned ABL
was squashed by the corporate Goliath that decided it, too, wanted
to field a women's league.
</P>
<P>
   There is some upside to this turn of events _ events that still
taste sour to some Reign fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think where (the WNBA is) different (from when the ABL was
operating) is that the best are all in one league now. So I think
you're going to see the best competing against each other,''
Anderson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me, there's a lot of versatility, especially in the post
players. You're going to see a lot of post players come out and
play out on the perimeter and be active out there. There are lot of
players, whether they're American or European, who have played over
there, so the international style might be more apparent. So in
some ways that brings a little more versatility, a little bit more
of a spread-out, wide-open game.''
</P>
<P>
   The new chapter opens with this sort of promise.
</P>
<P>
   What remains to be seen is whether ABL fans can forgive and
forget.
</P>
<P>
   What remains to be seen is whether the Storm can be an
entertaining alternative to a night at Safeco Field, where the
perfect Northwest summer weather is a draw regardless of how the
Mariners are faring.
</P>
<P>
   What remains to be seen is whether the Storm can carve an
identity for themselves _ separate from being the kid sisters to
the Sonics and something more than summertime filler for the people
who run Full House, owners of the Sonics and Storm.
</P>
<P>
   These things could seem like obstacles for a fledgling team like
the Storm.
</P>
<P>
   But given the history of women's basketball in Seattle, the
future surely holds some good times to be had by all.

PIPPEN FINALLY TAKES CHARGE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LEE BARNATHAN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Some Laker fans unfurled a banner high up in
Staples Center on Tuesday, probably too high for Scottie Pippen to
see.
</P>
<P>
   It said: ``Pippen + Jordan  &QC;  Ring. Pippen - Jordan  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Vacation.''
</P>
<P>
   The sentiment still might be proven true. But for this night,
Pippen, playing most of the night with two dislocated fingers on
his left hand, proved he could be an impact player without his more
famous partner.
</P>
<P>
   In leading the Trail Blazers to a 96-88 Game 5 victory, Pippen
did it all: brought the ball up the court, signaled instructions to
his teammates, exploited Lakers' foul troubles and led the team in
scoring.
</P>
<P>
   And this was after he was fined $10,000 for hitting John Salley
late in Game 4. The penalty came down earlier Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to be aggressive,'' said Pippen, who broke Jordan's
all-time playoff record for career steals with 380. ``We know in
our minds and hearts we can beat this team.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Scottie's a warrior,'' Blazers coach Mike Dunleavy said.
``He's out there, giving his best. ... He just really wanted it.''
</P>
<P>
   Pippen also whined and complained a little, but this time, he
rose above it and scored 22 points, six more than he has averaged
this series. That included a perfect 6-for-6 first half from the
field.
</P>
<P>
   Pippen attempted just one second-period shot, a 3-pointer at the
buzzer, and made it to give Portland a 53-45 lead.
</P>
<P>
   His other numbers - six steals, three assists, four blocked
shots and neutralization of Ron Harper (14 points but 1 of 5
3-pointers) - further illustrated his worth.
</P>
<P>
   So back to Portland for Game 6 they go.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's an all-around player,'' Detlef Schrempf said of Pippen.
``He's been around. He knows what it takes.''
</P>
<P>
   Schrempf has been around, too, having won the NBA Sixth Man
Award in 1990-91 and 1991-92. But, of course, he doesn't have the
six championship rings Pippen has.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's flashed me the gold a couple of times,'' Bonzi Wells
said. ``He blinded me with the diamonds. But that's Scottie. He's
here to give us a taste.''
</P>
<P>
   Pippen had been averaging 15.8 points, third-highest on his
team. But with elimination on the line, Pippen decided he needed to
make sure his team went home today - and take the Lakers with them.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's more aggressive, he's focused, and he's setting a good
example for everyone else,'' Schrempf said.
</P>
<P>
   Pippen seemed a step quicker Tuesday, driving the lane, making
some flashy passes, swatting away Shaquille O'Neal, that it offset
his whinier moments - making a dunk and wanting the call,
complaining when being called for a charge.
</P>
<P>
   But like the Pippen of Chicago days, he came to play and
inspired his teammates.
</P>
<P>
   Wells referred to his ``offensive intensity, defensive
intensity. Doesn't matter. Scottie's a real vocal leader. He talks
to on the court in a way that's respectable. He doesn't belittle
anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, anyone not wearing an NBA referee's shirt. But the fact
remains, Portland is alive today because the man called upon to
lead did.

PRACTICE TIME OVER FOR STORM; REAL DEAL STARTS IN SACRAMENTO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MEREDITH BAGLEY  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ It's the moment they've all been waiting for. After
months of planning, building, practicing and waiting, Seattle Storm
players and coaches realize their WNBA dream Wednesday night at 7
when the Storm visits the Sacramento Monarchs.
</P>
<P>
   For head coach Lin Dunn, the process of starting a team from
scratch has been a whirlwind.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems like just yesterday that I was dribbling a ball
through Seattle to sell tickets, and we were getting our logo and
name,'' she said as the Storm closed training camp Tuesday. ``All
of a sudden it's tipoff time.''
</P>
<P>
   Facing the powerful Monarchs, led by 1999 MVP Defensive Player
and Newcomer of the Year Yolanda Griffith, Dunn wouldn't mind a bit
more preparation time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like another week of practice since we're so young, but I
think a lot of teams wouldn't mind that,'' Dunn said. ``It doesn't
matter if we're ready _ it's time to go.''
</P>
<P>
   After their first franchise victory over Los Angeles on Friday,
the Storm players feel confident they can pull off a similar upset
in Sacramento.
</P>
<P>
   ``Beating L.A. was a tremendous morale boost for us,'' Dunn
said. ``We'd seen progress all week in practice, but to go into
their building and win was a real boost. It shows things are
working.''
</P>
<P>
   Seattle put the pieces together to top the Sparks 75-69, finding
an inside scorer in Simone Edwards (18 points, seven rebounds) to
complement Edna Campbell's deadly perimeter game.
</P>
<P>
   Campbell, who scored a career-high 25 in Los Angeles, finished
the preseason as the league's leading scorer.
</P>
<P>
   The Storm also cut down on turnovers and fouls against the
Sparks and shot over 40 percent from the field for the first time.
Dunn knows her team will need that kind of all-around effort to
dethrone the Monarchs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will try to balance our scoring like we did in L.A.,'' Dunn
said. ``We also need to be patient and take the air out of the ball
a bit. We need to break them down and hold the ball a bit longer
than other teams.''
</P>
<P>
   Seattle will depart from its usual uptempo style in response to
the potent Sacramento attack. The league's second-highest scoring
team last year, the Monarchs haven't slowed down, posting a 4-0
preseason record with two 20-point victories.
</P>
<P>
   Forward Tangela Smith leads Sacramento in scoring with 14.3
average, while the 6-foot-3 Griffith is averaging 12.5 points and
8.3 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   All-Star point guard Ticha Penicheiro led the league in assists
last year, with 7.1 per game, and Olympic team member Ruthie
Bolton-Holifield gives the Monarchs another All-Star threat on the
outside.
</P>
<P>
   ``As talented as Los Angeles was, Sacramento may be even
better,'' Dunn said. ``Yolanda Griffith is the premier power
forward in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Griffith, also Olympics-bound, led or ranked in the top three in
five major statistical categories last year, despite missing
several games late in the season to a knee injury.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't shut down Yolanda,'' Dunn said. ``We will try to
limit the time she touches the ball and make her give it up when
she does get it.''
</P>
<P>
   For its part, Seattle must continue to score inside to take the
pressure off Campbell, and play solid defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key is defense,'' Storm point guard Sonja Henning said.
``They have great athletes who can score a lot, and we need to slow
them down and make it a half-court game.''
</P>
<P>
   The Monarchs are candidates to unseat Houston as WNBA champion
this year, a prediction not lost on Henning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sacramento is one of the best, if not the best, teams in the
league this year,'' she said. ``We know that, and this game will be
a great opportunity to show us where we are and where we need to
be.''
</P>
<P>
   Win or lose, one outcome is for sure for Seattle's new WNBA
team: it's game time.

 By CARLTON THOMPSON  
 c. 2000, Houston Chronicle  
DENVER _ If Astros manager Larry Dierker starts wearing sunglasses
at night games, it won't be because he's trying to make a fashion
statement. It's just that he might do anything to shade his view of
what has been happening on the field night after night.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Astros let another victory slip through their grasp Tuesday
night, losing 10-7 to the Colorado Rockies at Coors Field.
</P>
<P>
   What was shaping up as an uplifting come-from-behind victory
ended like so many other losses this season. The Astros dug
themselves a four-run hole after three innings but took the lead in
the eighth, only to watch the comeback go to waste.
</P>
<P>
   Easy come, easy go.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockies scored four runs in the bottom of the eighth,
sending the Astros to their 11th loss in their last 15 games. The
Astros fell 11 games behind National League Central
Division-leading St. Louis, matching the most games they have been
out of first place this season.
</P>
<P>
   Yorkis Perez's bases-loaded walk to Todd Helton forced home the
decisive run, but the Astros were left to wonder if the eighth
inning might have played out differently if not for Craig Biggio's
throwing error on a ground ball by Jeff Cirillo with one out,
runners at first and second, and the score tied at 7.
</P>
<P>
   One out was a given, and a potential inning-ending double play
for reliever Marc Valdes (1-1) seemed like a possibility, although
it wasn't a sure thing. Biggio attempted to get an out at second
base, but his throw to shortstop Julio Lugo was off the mark.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't think we were going to get two (outs) on that play,''
Biggio said. ``But we should have gotten the one out. I didn't have
a good grip on the ball, and it ended up being costly.
</P>
<P>
   ``We made a lot of mistakes. When you're having the kind of
season we're having, every mistake is costly. There always seems to
be something happening during the course of a game that costs us.''
</P>
<P>
   Overall, it was another sloppy game for the Astros, who were
charged with two errors and failed to make at least that many other
plays. The baserunning also was suspect, particularly that of Mitch
Meluskey, who was picked off after leading off the third inning
with a walk and got caught in a rundown after driving in the
go-ahead run in the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   But it's the inconsistent defense that has made Dierker cringe
the most. The Astros are on a pace to commit 124 errors, which
would be their highest total in three years.
</P>
<P>
   ``This game was not about Todd Helton,'' Dierker said. ``This
was about catching the ball and not playing good defense. When you
play in a park like this, you have to play good defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we get the single out on the Biggio play, there's a base
open, and we walk Helton. You have to make the plays here, and we
didn't make the plays. If we make the plays, we can hold the score
down to a level we need to win games.
</P>
<P>
   ``This doesn't even seem like the team that we've seen for the
past three years. We're kicking the ball around, and it's hard to
watch.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this season, the Astros couldn't wait to get out of
Houston to escape Enron Field. Now, they can't wait to go back.
Tuesday's loss was their eighth in a row on the road and the 13th
in their last 16 games away from Enron.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros wasted a balanced 12-hit attack, led by Bill Spiers,
Ken Caminiti and Richard Hidalgo, who had two hits apiece. Lance
Berkman chimed in with a career-high four RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   Caminiti left the game after his sixth-inning single because of
a mild strain of his right hamstring. His status will be evaluated
daily.
</P>
<P>
   Astros starter Scott Elarton would have liked nothing more than
to pick up a victory in front of the 60 family members and friends
who made the trip from Lamar, Colo., to watch their favorite son
pitch.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockies scored four runs off Elarton over the first three
innings and had nine hits and six runs during the righthander's
six-inning performance, which was better than the pitching line
indicates.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's probably the best I've felt since the surgery,'' said
Elarton, referring to the offseason procedure on his right rotator
cuff. ``I felt like my pitches had good action on them. They hit
quite a few good pitches. I made my share of mistakes, but they did
a good job of situational hitting.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rockies scored two runs in the first inning, one on Helton's
sacrifice fly. Helton, who ranks among the league leaders with 51
RBIs, has driven in 10 runs in five games against the Astros this
season.
</P>
<P>
   Colorado added another run in the second on Tom Goodwin's
double, and Jeffrey Hammonds' RBI single in the third pushed the
lead to four runs.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros finally joined the scoring in the fourth inning on
Berkman's three-run homer off Rockies starter Kevin Jarvis. Berkman
has homered in three of the last four games, and the Astros have at
least one homer in a club-record 17 consecutive games. Since being
recalled from Class AAA New Orleans on Friday, Berkman is hitting
.375 with nine RBIs and six runs in five games.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockies added two more runs in the fifth on a single by
Darren Bragg and a sacrifice fly by Brent Mayne, who has driven in
four runs in the first two games of the series.
</P>
<P>
   Caminiti led off the sixth inning with a single up the middle
but was lifted in favor of pinch runner Lugo. Hidalgo's double to
left gave the Astros runners at second and third with nobody out.
</P>
<P>
   Lefthanded reliever Brian Bohanon replaced Jarvis after
Hidalgo's two-base hit. Berkman and Daryle Ward each drove in a run
with groundouts, trimming the Rockies' lead to 6-5.
</P>
<P>
   Meluskey's two-run single in the eighth gave the Astros their
only lead, but it was short-lived after the Rockies turned the
tables, scoring four runs (one earned) off Valdes, who was making
his second appearance with the Astros since being acquired in a
trade with Tampa Bay last weekend.

LAKERS SEE OPPORTUNITY SLIP AWAY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ When aggression gave way to duress, when momentum
was surrendered to desperation, and when precision disappeared in a
cloud of dust and a crowd of bodies in the lane, the Lakers' steady
charge toward the NBA Finals stopped with a thunderous thud,
accompanied by a repetitive clanging sound.
</P>
<P>
   Scottie Pippen charged, and the Lakers bowed.
</P>
<P>
   Rasheed Wallace attacked, and they deferred.
</P>
<P>
   And jump shot after jump shot after jump shot bounced and banged
and dropped harmlessly away as the Lakers lost a chance to clinch a
Finals berth, falling 96-88 to the Portland Trail Blazers on
Tuesday before a subdued 18,997 at Staples Center.
</P>
<P>
   Momentum belonged to the Lakers after a two-game sweep at
Portland over the weekend. But the night belonged to Pippen, whose
22 points and masterful play at both ends of the court took the
Lakers off balance, and gave Portland new life in the Western
Conference finals.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers take a fragile 3-2 lead into the Rose Garden on
Friday for Game 6.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should be ticked,'' said Glen Rice. ``We had an opportunity
to close it, and it was here on our home court. But now we've gotta
realize that we've got to regroup and be ready to go to war
Friday.''
</P>
<P>
   And they'll have to remember to pack instructions to assembling
the triangle offense.
</P>
<P>
   For most the evening, the Lakers alternated between standing
around, waiting for Shaquille O'Neal to free himself up, and
settling for perimeter shots. In a game they never led, the Lakers
attempted an eye-popping 27 shots from the 3-point arc, making just
six, and shot 30 for 79 (38 percent) overall.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just have to play smarter,'' O'Neal said. ``We need to
stick with what got us the wins.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal used a late charge to get to 31 points _ his high this
series _ and added 21 rebounds, but he also committed five
turnovers, and no one else could contribute consistent offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a disappointment for us,'' said coach Phil Jackson,
``but it's not a surprise. We didn't shoot the ball well, we shot
too many 3-point shots. And we ended up standing on the perimeter a
lot in this ballgame, trying to get the ball in to Shaq but not
finding a way, and you have to credit Portland for some of that.''
</P>
<P>
   The Blazers also get some credit for destroying the Lakers'
ability to play defense. Kobe Bryant was dogged by early foul
trouble, as were fellow guards Brian Shaw and Ron Harper, most of
that damage done by Pippen.
</P>
<P>
   No one criticized the officiating, but the Lakers clearly were
befuddled by some early tough calls.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's disappointing, because depending upon how the referees
call a ballgame in a night (determines) what kind of defense you
can play in this game,'' Jackson said. ``And we like to play good
individual defense, and suddenly all our players are in foul
trouble _ Shaw, Harper and Kobe. Then we have to end up rotating
and start running around playing junk defense. ... Scottie created
a foul situation. That's what happened to us.''
</P>
<P>
   Bryant couldn't accomplish much offensively either, going 4 for
13 from the field for 17 points, balanced out by six turnovers in a
wild performance reminiscent of the old Kobe Bryant.
</P>
<P>
   And Rice, coming off a 21-point breakthrough in Game 4, went
silent again, finishing with 4 points on 1-of-8 shooting, going 0
for 5 from the arc. Robert Horry added a 3-for-11 line off the
bench.
</P>
<P>
   ``Other than abandoning our offense tonight and not being able
to play the aggressive defense to stop their big guards, that put
us in a hole,'' said Rick Fox. ``And we got not passive, but a
little back on our heels again.''
</P>
<P>
   The defeat dropped the Lakers to 2-4 in closeout games in this
postseason, proving they still have a few things to learn about
becoming champions. As he has in the past, Jackson spun this as an
opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to have to take a little more time to win this
series,''Jackson said, ``and I think it's really good for us as a
basketball team. This team has not grown enough to understand some
of the subtleties of what we're trying to do. And it's a good
measure for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Holding to form in this series, the Lakers sputtered early and
fell to a double-digit lead. And after shooting 31.1 percent in the
first half, they were fortunate to be down only eight points, 53-45
at halftime.
</P>
<P>
   Pippen hit the floor with fire shooting from his fingertips,
once again becoming a force at both ends of the floor to lead the
Blazers' charge. By the end of the first quarter, he already had 12
points, a steal and three blocked shots.
</P>
<P>
   By halftime, he also had a dislocated left ring finger, but
still had a team-high 15 points and had upped his steals total to
three.
</P>
<P>
   The Blazers never trailed, hitting 50 percent of their shots _
including a buzzer-beating 3-pointer from Pippen to close the half.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe, just maybe, the Lakers got a little comfortable with
their 3-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were obviously looking to go home tonight with our minds on
preparing for the next round,'' Fox said, ``but that wasn't the
case.''
</P>
<P>
   And an odd series in which each team has won twice on the
other's homecourt stuck to its pattern.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, you all don't listen to me when I talk,'' Portland
coach Mike Dunleavy said. ``I told you from the very beginning that
I didn't think there was a home-court advantage in this series.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought that either team was capable of winning every game
on the other team's home court, that it was going to come down to
how you play every night, and that's been the key.''

PORTLAND PUTS LAKERS' CORONATION ON HOLD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RONALD TILLERY  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ This time, there was no second-half scoring
drought. The crucial free throws from an unlikely source did not
materialize. And the Portland Trail Blazers never lost their
composure.
</P>
<P>
   In other words: A coronation proclaiming the Los Angeles Lakers
as kings of the Western Conference was put on hold.
</P>
<P>
   The Blazers knew they needed a royal performance Tuesday night
in the Staples Center, and they crowned the Lakers 96-88 in Game 5
to extend the Western Conference finals.
</P>
<P>
   Once demoralized, the Blazers can force a Game 7 here Sunday by
winning Game 6 Friday in the Rose Garden.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know in our minds and hearts we can outplay this team,''
said Scottie Pippen, who led the Blazers with 22 points, six
rebounds, six steals and high intensity.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've outplayed this team throughout the series. We just
haven't finished them off (in games).''
</P>
<P>
   Now trailing the best-of-seven series 3-2, the Blazers exorcised
every demon that plagued them in back-to-back home losses. They
pressured the Lakers on both ends of the floor, got major
production from their key players and won their second straight
game on the road in this series.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not going to go down very easily,'' Portland coach Mike
Dunleavy said. ``I wouldn't expect any less.''
</P>
<P>
   The Blazers had won just two of their previous 11 road games in
the conference finals. But they knew they could win in the Staples
Center, as one of those victories was a 106-77 thrashing of the
Lakers here in Game 2.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's game took on similar characteristics, considering the
Blazers were crisp and the Lakers were cold offensively. Los
Angeles shot 38 percent, including a dismal 6-for-27 from beyond
the 3-point arc.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're still in a hole. We're still trying to fight out, and we
still have to take it one game at a time,'' said Blazers forward
Rasheed Wallace, who matched Pippen's 22 points and added 10
rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   The Blazers have reclaimed the momentum, if not planted a seed
of doubt in the Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to have to take a little more time to win this
series, and it's good for us,'' Lakers coach Phil Jackson said.
``This team has not grown enough to understand some of the
subtleties of what we're trying to do, and it is a good measure for
us.''
</P>
<P>
   That was Jackson's way of saying his team played out of control,
without focus and would not know killer instinct if it came wrapped
in purple and gold.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles is now 2-4 in potential series-ending games during
this postseason run. The Lakers had a 3-0 lead against Phoenix in
the Western Conference semifinals but lost Game 4 before winning
Game 5. They were up 2-0 against Sacramento and went the distance,
finally securing Game 5 in that first-round series.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was an opportunity missed,'' said center Shaquille O'Neal,
whose 31 points and 21 rebounds made him the only productive Laker.
``There is an old basketball saying: `You live by the jump shot and
you die by the jump shot.' We shot 27 threes and only made six. I
thought we played pretty good defense, but we didn't put the ball
in the basket.''
</P>
<P>
   The poise Portland displayed didn't help, either.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of going into a complete funk in the third quarter, the
Blazers, ahead 72-67 with 1:53 left in the third, closed out the
quarter with an 8-0 run.
</P>
<P>
   Led by Pippen, the Blazers' entire lineup remained in attack
mode.
</P>
<P>
   ``We fought that third quarter. The last two games they kicked
our (butts) in the third. But we fought hard this time,'' Wallace
said, his voice booming as he talked about his teammates'
contributions.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal had little help. Laker guard Kobe Bryant finished with 17
points but missed 9 of 13 shots. Glen Rice misfired on 7 of his 8
attempts.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we're going to be a championship team, we're going to have
to face adversity,'' Bryant said. `` ... Without stress, there's no
progress.''
</P>
<P>
   Several of those Laker misses were bricks, some _ particularly
in Bryant's case _ due to poor shot selection. There was also just
too much Pippen.
</P>
<P>
   With 9:20 left in the third quarter, Bryant picked up his fourth
foul while guarding Pippen, who made up for passive performances in
Games 3 and 4. Pippen took the ball right at Bryant and the rim
from the opening tip.
</P>
<P>
   Pippen did not miss until 5:47 was left in the third. He sank
his first six shots, including a 3-pointer that put Portland ahead
53-45 as the first half ended.
</P>
<P>
   Pippen took turns tormenting Bryant, Brian Shaw and Ron Harper _
all of whom played with foul trouble. Jackson argued that the
situation forced the Lakers to play ``junk'' defense, utilizing
double-teams when they would rather play straight up.
</P>
<P>
   Portland, the more active team, took advantage and kept making
shots.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even when it started to get rough out there, we continued to
go with it,'' Blazers forward Brian Grant said. ``We didn't blow
up, lose our cool or do anything to hurt the team. Now we can go
home.''

ABBOTT GOOD, BUT NOT GOOD ENOUGH AGAINST WHITE SOX 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JIM CAPLE  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ On the other hand, Paul Abbott avoided being hit by
any broken bats, baseballs, batting helmets, shin guards, water
jugs, Moose antlers or other assorted dangerous projectiles.
</P>
<P>
   Abbott also pitched very well in his first start since getting
hit in the face with a broken bat last week _ just not as well as
Chicago White Sox starter James Baldwin. Abbott allowed two solo
home runs in seven innings, Baldwin held the Mariners to one run
and that was the difference in Seattle's 2-1 loss to the White Sox
at Safeco Field Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a loss, so it wasn't good enough,'' Abbott said. ``I gave
up seven runs against Oakland (two weeks ago) and the result is the
same. James Baldwin was just excellent tonight, and I gave up one
run too many.''
</P>
<P>
   Abbott, who has been dogged by injuries throughout his career,
had a scary moment in his previous start last week in Baltimore
when Harold Baines' bat broke and sailed into the pitcher's face,
literally knocking him out of the game with cuts, a broken nose and
a black eye. As Jamie Moyer said, if the bat hit him slightly
differently, it could have been the end of his career.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, the bat could have missed him entirely as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made a mistake and watched it again last night. I probably
shouldn't have done that,'' Abbott said. ``The first time was all
right, but the second time ... I went to bed thinking about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Abbott said his close encounter with the bat didn't bother him
once he got on the mound Tuesday night, and he certainly pitched
like it didn't.
</P>
<P>
   With the area around his right eye bruised blue and green (``To
match the uniform,'' he said), Abbott pitched what was easily his
best game of the season, and one of the better games of his career.
He threw his pitches for strikes and kept the hitters off-balance
with his outstanding changeup. He walked none, struck out seven and
allowed only four hits in seven innings.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately for Abbott, two of those hits were home runs.
Carlos Lee slammed a pitch well over the center-field fence for a
game-tying home run in the fifth inning and Ray Durham lined a 3-2
pitch just over the wall in left, giving Chicago the lead in the
sixth.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the first one, I caught too much of the plate and he
hammered it, like he's supposed to do,'' Abbott said. ``I had
Durham behind 0-2 and had him on the defensive, but he fought back.
I didn't want to walk him.''
</P>
<P>
   Durham's home run spelled the difference, thanks to Baldwin, who
is 8-1 with a 3.09 ERA, off to the best start of his career. A
notoriously slow starter, Baldwin is 16-5 since last year's
All-Star break. He's pitching so well that ESPN called for a
postgame interview, which Baldwin did while standing in the dugout
in his underwear.
</P>
<P>
   Baldwin limited the Mariners to one run and four hits in seven
innings, even cooling down league batting leader Edgar Martinez,
who was held hitless for just the second time in the past 27 games.
</P>
<P>
   The only run Baldwin allowed was driven in by his old roommate
and good friend, Seattle center fielder Mike Cameron. The two
roomed together in the minors and Cameron's rookie year in the
majors, but had never faced each other until Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Baldwin struck out Cameron in the first inning, but the
outfielder fared better in the third when he gave Seattle a brief
lead, singling home Rickey Henderson from second base. That was all
Seattle could manage against Baldwin, while the White Sox scored
just enough against Abbott to win.
</P>
<P>
   ``He felt my presence and I felt his,'' Cameron said. ``He
pitched us pretty tough tonight. He kept us off-balance, and made
some good pitches when he had to. He's throwing all his pitches for
strikes.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the loss, the Mariners remained in first place in the
American League West, where just 1{ games separate Seattle from
last-place Oakland. Chicago maintained its surprising first-place
lead over Cleveland in the AL Central.

DODGERS LOSE IT IN NINTH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Another day, another Dodger injured. Or two.
</P>
<P>
   Catcher Todd Hundley and reserve outfielder Geronimo Berroa both
left in the sixth inning with injuries. Hundley strained a rib cage
muscle on his right side and Berroa suffered a contusion on his
left foot.
</P>
<P>
   Compounding the troubles of the night was a blown save by Jeff
Shaw as the Mets rallied for six runs in the ninth, including a
grand slam by Todd Pratt, to beat the Dodgers 10-5 Tuesday at
Dodger Stadium in a game than lasted more than four hours.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers entered the ninth leading 5-4, but Shaw failed to
record an out before being replaced by one-time Chicago Cubs closer
Terry Adams.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Piazza led off the ninth with a single to left and was
replaced at first by Jay Payton. Robin Ventura walked on four
pitches and Todd Zeile singled to center to score Payton, tying the
score 5-5 and chasing Shaw. It was Shaw's fifth blown save in 16
chances, and he fell to 2-3.
</P>
<P>
   Adams struck out pinch-hitter Joe McEwing for the first out, but
he walked Kurt Abbott, who was hitting .194, to load the bases.
Adams struck out Joe Nunnally, but then walked Melvin Mora,
recalled earlier in the day to replace Rey Ordonez, to force in a
run and give the Mets a 6-5 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Pratt then hit Adams' 1-2 pitch over the fence in left field to
give the Mets a 10-5 advantage.
</P>
<P>
   Making it potentially worse is the loss of Hundley, who's added
another dimension to the lineup because of his health. He has 13
homers and 33 RBI, and was providing offense as a left-handed and
right-handed hitter,as well as depth to the middle of the lineup.
</P>
<P>
   Hundley doubled to lead off the sixth off Mets starter Bobby
Jones. Pinch-hitter Kevin Elster singled to center off reliever
Dennis Cook, but Hundley was held at third by coach Glenn Hoffman.
Hundley apparently injured the intercostal muscle of his rib cage
while stopping suddenly. He was replaced by Chad Kreuter, who
scored on Berroa's single.
</P>
<P>
   Todd Hollandsworth struck out, but Mark Grudzielanek gave the
Dodgers a 5-4 lead with a single to left off Pat Mahomes to score
Elster. But on the play Berroa aggravated his injury, which he hurt
when he fouled a pitch off his foot during his at-bat.
</P>
<P>
   Berroa was diagnosed with a left foot contusion and was having
precautionary X-rays taken.
</P>
<P>
   Hundley will be re-evaluated today, but it didn't look good. He
needed help walking down the dugout stairs and was in obvious pain.
</P>
<P>
   If Hundley's injury forces him to the disabled list, he'll be
the fifth starter to be there this season. Currently, center
fielder Devon White and third baseman Adrian Beltre are on the
15-day disabled list. Elster and right-hander Kevin Brown spent
time on the disabled list earlier this season. Pitchers Gregg Olson
and Jeff Williams are also on the disabled list, and right-hander
Mike Fetters spent three weeks on the disabled list before
returning Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Dodgers right fielder Shawn Green singled to score Todd
Hollandsworth with two outs in the third to tie it 1-1 before Eric
Karros unloaded on Bobby Jones' 2-1 pitch for his 14th homer of the
season. It went deep into the left-field seats and gave the Dodgers
a 3-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
   The homer also pulled Karros within three of Ron Cey's Los
Angeles Dodgers record of 228 career homers.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets chipped away at the Dodgers' two-run deficit in the
fifth inning when Edgardo Alfonzo led off with a double and scored
on Mike Piazza's singled to right. That was the last batter starter
Eric Gagne faced.
</P>
<P>
   Matt Herges relieved and got out of the inning without further
damage, but the dependable rookie had trouble in the sixth after
striking out the first two batters. Melvin Mora singled, Derek Bell
followed wiP,th an infield single to third and the runners moved up
a base on third baseman Dave Hansen's throwing error. Alfonzo gave
the Mets a 4-3 lead with a two-run single to left.

TOUGH LESSON FOR SHAQ, KOBE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Rewind ``Pomp and Circumstance,'' hold the
commencement speeches. Shaquille O'Neal and Kobe Bryant have one
more test to pass before they complete their advanced course work.
</P>
<P>
   You know, toward their NBA degree.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, O'Neal and Bryant fell eight points short of a
passing grade in ``Clinching 300: The Art of Closing the Deal.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a tad troublesome that this one last class has caused them
such consternation. After all, everything they've learned to this
point was supposed to prepare them to ace it.
</P>
<P>
   We fully expected them to matriculate to the NBA Finals without
further delay, especially considering they've spent the past year
learning at the knee of the professorial Phil Jackson, the most
esteemed educator in their field of study.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, it would have been gratifying if O'Neal and Bryant
had been able to lead the Lakers past Portland in five games in
their best-of-seven Western Conference final.
</P>
<P>
   They gave no indication in the days leading up to this test that
they would suffer a panic attack and just freeze right there in
front of 18,997 people at the Staples Center.
</P>
<P>
   We were sure they'd be completely comfortable flaunting
everything they learned when Sacramento took them to five games in
the first round of the playoffs and Phoenix foiled their sweep in
the second round.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, their 96-88 loss to the Trail Blazers was a setback.
</P>
<P>
   But now is not the time to panic. Bryant and O'Neal have another
chance to pass this test on Friday. If they require it, Game 7 on
Sunday is out there like an ultimatum.
</P>
<P>
   This latest setback notwithstanding, O'Neal and Bryant remain on
schedule to graduate in four years from the L.A. satellite campus
of the School of Hard Knocks.
</P>
<P>
   They enrolled as Lakers together in the fall of 1996. Bryant
came straight out of high school while O'Neal transferred in from
the satellite campus in Orlando.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal, 28, got his first advanced NBA degree as a member of the
Magic, leading the team to the Finals in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the Magic lost to the Houston Rockets, O'Neal felt
pretty confident he'd have a wall full of these advanced degress by
the time he turned 30.
</P>
<P>
   But his learning curve seemed to hit a glass ceiling in L.A.
Bryant, meanwhile, had a lot of catching up to do.
</P>
<P>
   He had to learn how to co-exist on the court with other highly
skilled players, for one thing. Bryant, 21, also had to figure out
how to dispense all of his energy equally between defense and
offense.
</P>
<P>
   Bryant and O'Neal flunked plenty of tests before they finally
succeeded. There was their four-game loss to Utah in the 1998
Western Conference finals. They looked pretty unprepared for that
test.
</P>
<P>
   Then there was their four-game exit in the second round last
year to eventual NBA champion San Antonio. O'Neal looked like he
was winging that one.
</P>
<P>
   This time, Bryant was the one guilty of improvising as he went
along. He missed six of the first seven shots he tried against the
Trail Blazers and bore little resemblance to the composed player
that nailed the shot to beat Phoenix in Game 2 of that series,
blocked the shot to keep the Trail Blazers beaten in Game 3 of this
series and distributed a game-high seven assists in Sunday's Game
4.
</P>
<P>
   A single sequence in the waning seconds of the second quarter
perfectly captured Bryant's plight on this night. Bryant had the
ball with 15 seconds remaining and was looking to cut the Trail
Blazers' lead to three. But he lost the ball - one of his game-high
six turnovers - and ended up looking at Scottie Pippen drain a
three-pointer at the other end to put the Trail Blazers ahead 53-45
at the half.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal missed eight of the 14 shots he tried in the opening 24
minutes. But if he had trouble finding his rhythm, there was a
reason. Instead of working the ball inside to their seven-footer,
the Lakers obdurately launched quick shots from the perimeter.
</P>
<P>
   Bryant, who ended up fouling out with 4:45 left to play,
accounted for three of the Lakers' 27 three-pointers. That was four
more than they tried from beyond the three-point arc in their
29-point loss in Game 2 and about a dozen too many.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was an opportunity missed,'' said O'Neal, who finished with
31 points and 21 rebounds. ``We shot 27 threes and only made six.
You live by the jump shot and you die by the jump shot.''
</P>
<P>
   That's one lesson learned. We trust Bryant and O'Neal also are
wiser for having let this opportunity slip away. We're sure they
know it's best to matriculate to the NBA Finals without further
delay. They're much too advanced to be held back another year.

DON'T WORRY, IT'S JUST A SETUP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ What the Lakers need now, like NBA playoff losers
throughout the television age, is a good conspiracy theory.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately for their bruised egos, the best theory we can
come up with does not include the referees or the clock operators
or the schedulemakers or anybody with the power to tip the outcomes
of games and series to help the league's favorite network make more
money.
</P>
<P>
   This theory does not offer an excuse for the Lakers after their
latest clunker, a 96-88 loss at Staples Center to the Portland
Trail Blazers, who stayed alive in the Western Conference finals by
controlling Game 5 from start to finish.
</P>
<P>
   This theory has the Lakers going Grassy Knoll on themselves.
</P>
<P>
   How else do you explain how a team capable of brilliant
performances like Sunday afternoon's in Portland can turn in
efforts like Tuesday night's at home?
</P>
<P>
   How else do you explain how a team that can dominate the Trail
Blazers the way the Lakers did in Game 1 is capable of losing by 29
points in Game 2?
</P>
<P>
   How else do you explain how the Lakers keep finding ways to make
their postseason so fan-tastically exciting, just when they should
be putting opponents and TV audiences to sleep?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not one of those things where you can just give a reason;
it happens. There's a lot of circumstances that come into play,''
said A.C. Green, with tell-tale vagueness.
</P>
<P>
   Green added: ``I can't pinpoint one or two things. You could
pinpoint a hundred things. All of them would probably be right.''
</P>
<P>
   We imagine a cabal of 12 tall men, speaking in hushed tones in a
locker room, before the game where they could have completed an
opening-round sweep of the Sacramento Kings. After which they lost
two games in a row to force a do-or-die Game 5.
</P>
<P>
   As with any conspiracy theory, it (begin ital)could(end ital)
have happened.
</P>
<P>
   It could have happened before the game where they could have
completed a second-round sweep of the Phoenix Suns. After which
they were blown out in Arizona and had to come home to wrap up the
series.
</P>
<P>
   It could have happened Tuesday, as they stood on the verge of
beating Portland 4 games to 1 and going to the NBA Finals for the
first time since the era of Magic Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're making it look too easy,'' they might have said to each
other.
</P>
<P>
   They might have realized that great teams are measured by the
adversity they overcome and their response to critical tests.
</P>
<P>
   After so sublime a regular season - for instance, Kobe Bryant
was the only starter to get hurt, and he returned to action Dec. 1
- maybe they're just setting up tests for themselves.
</P>
<P>
   They lose playoff games by margins that should embarrass a team
with 67 regular-season wins. And when they win, they do so by
coming from behind, trailing by double-digit margins in their two
victories in Portland.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe they're like the rich men who race cars or climb
mountains. They like to put themselves in danger. For the thrill of
it, not just the ratings.
</P>
<P>
   But sometimes they lose control of games early and they can't
get it back.
</P>
<P>
   That's what happened Tuesday. The Blazers took their usual lead
in the opening minutes. The Lakers nibbled away at the lead but
never drew even.
</P>
<P>
   Kobe Bryant, perhaps limited by a foot sprain, had his worst
night in weeks. The Lakers deserved all those fouls for letting the
Blazers take the ball to the basket early and often.
</P>
<P>
   The Blazers made it a 10-point game early in the second quarter.
The Lakers kept firing up errant 3-point shots.
</P>
<P>
   A couple of postseason trends held. The Lakers shot 38 percent
and lost for the fifth time in six games where they've shot less
than 43 percent. They lost for the fifth time in eight games where
they've allowed 96 or more points.
</P>
<P>
   You'll hear from some hand-wringers that the Lakers are in
trouble now. Game 6 is in Portland on Friday and the Blazers will
be the ones with nothing to lose.
</P>
<P>
   Lakers fans, relax. Game 5 was just a case of the Lakers living
dangerously again.
</P>
<P>
   They'll win this series and they'll go to the NBA Finals against
the New York Knicks or Indiana Pacers. Then they'll be expected to
win that series in four or five games.
</P>
<P>
   NBC bean-counters, relax. The Lakers will find a way to make the
Finals interesting. For you, and for themselves. In these playoffs
they always find a way to do that.

TOUGH NIGHT FOR KOBE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By STEVE DILBECK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ These are not the nights that make superstars, not
that in the end any one needed to point it out to Kobe Bryant.
</P>
<P>
   Bryant was hardly the only Laker who struggled in their
disappointing 96-88 loss to the Blazers in Game 5 of the Western
Conference Finals on Tuesday night, but if only by status, he was
the most visible.
</P>
<P>
   He opened the game 1-for-8 from the field, before finishing
4-of-13. He had six turnovers. He was scorched for most of Scottie
Pippen's 22 points. The first-team, all-defensive standout did not
have a steal. And then as a final ignobly to his sorry night, he
fouled out with 4:45 to play.
</P>
<P>
   All and all, not the playoff game of his superstar dreams.
</P>
<P>
   Bryant finished with 17 points -- eight coming from the
free-throw line -- five rebounds and four assists.
</P>
<P>
   That's as much good news as he could muster.
</P>
<P>
   For most of the night, he found lanes closing quickly. He found
hands in his face. He found a ball that wouldn't stay in his hands.
</P>
<P>
   The player who almost single-handedly kept the Lakers in Game 3
before they could rally to pull out the victory, suffered through
an overall miserable night, often resembling the young guard who
played a little out of control.
</P>
<P>
   ``A little bit?'' repeated Lakers coach Phil Jackson. ``He got a
lot out of control.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers said Bryant sprained his right foot in the first
half. X-rays take n after the game were negative, and he is
scheduled to have it re-examined today.
</P>
<P>
   Bryant didn't blame his foot for his play, though he described
it a little more favorably than Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was shaky,'' Bryant said. ``I just have to take what the
defense gives me.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was trying to get to the basket, taking what Portland gave
me.''
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, it wasn't much.
</P>
<P>
   The officials also hardly treated Bryant with superstar status
with some of the borderline fouls they called against him.
</P>
<P>
   But after he traveled for his sixth turnover, Jackson sat him
with 7:05 to play in the fourth quarter, the Lakers down by 11 and
desperately needing offense to mount a charge.
</P>
<P>
   Did this ever happen to Michael Jordan?
</P>
<P>
   Bryant, though, has never been one to lack belief in himself and
he wasn't about to let Tuesday's performance impact his confidence.
``You just keep going,'' he said. ``Without stress, there is no
progress.''
</P>

NOTHING BUT BAD NEWS FOR DODGERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Another day, another Dodger injured. Or two.
</P>
<P>
   Catcher Todd Hundley and reserve outfielder Geronimo Berroa left
in the sixth inning with injuries. Hundley strained a rib cage
muscle on his right side and Berroa suffered a contusion on his
left foot.
</P>
<P>
   Compounding the troubles of the night was a blown save by Jeff
Shaw as the Mets rallied for six runs in the ninth, including a
grand slam by Todd Pratt, to beat the Dodgers 10-5 Tuesday at
Dodger Stadium in a game than lasted more than four hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hundley felt a little burning sensation in there and then
cramped,'' Dodgers manager Davey Johnson said. ``It's possible he
could have pulled something in there or torn an oblique muscle.
He's not doing good right now.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers entered the ninth leading 5-4, but Shaw failed to
record an out before being replaced by one-time Chicago Cubs closer
Terry Adams.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Piazza led off the ninth with a single to left and was
replaced at first by Jay Payton. Robin Ventura walked on four
pitches and Todd Zeile singled to center to score Payton, tying the
score 5-5 and chasing Shaw. It was Shaw's fifth blown save in 16
chances, and he fell to 2-3.
</P>
<P>
   Adams struck out pinch-hitter Joe McEwing for the first out, but
he walked Kurt Abbott, who was hitting .194, to load the bases.
Adams struck out Joe Nunnally, but then walked Melvin Mora,
recalled earlier in the day to replace Rey Ordonez, to force in a
run and give the Mets a 6-5 lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shaw, I'm going to have to stay off him for a while,'' Johnson
said. ``He needs a little rest. I'm going to have to play (the
closer's role) by ear. I probably might do a little committee. I
have a few guys with experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Pratt then hit Adams' 1-2 pitch over the fence in left field to
give the Mets a 10-5 advantage.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a bad stretch,'' said Shaw, who admitted he was feeling
tired but was not in pain. ``I'll do what (Johnson) says. I
understand his thinking.''
</P>
<P>
   Making it potentially worse is the loss of Hundley, who's added
another dimension to the lineup because of his health. He has 13
homers and 33 RBI, and was providing offense as a left-handed and
right-handed hitter, as well as depth to the middle of the lineup.
</P>
<P>
   Hundley doubled to lead off the sixth off Mets starter Bobby
Jones. Pinch-hitter Kevin Elster singled to center off reliever
Dennis Cook, but Hundley was held at third by coach Glenn Hoffman.
Hundley apparently injured the intercostal muscle of his rib cage
while stopping suddenly. He was replaced by Chad Kreuter, who
scored on Berroa's single.
</P>
<P>
   Todd Hollandsworth struck out, but Mark Grudzielanek gave the
Dodgers a 5-4 lead with a single to left off Pat Mahomes to score
Elster. But on the play Berroa aggravated his injury, which
occurred when he fouled a pitch off his foot during his at-bat.
</P>
<P>
   X-rays on Berroa's foot were negative and he's listed as
day-to-day.
</P>
<P>
   Hundley will be re-evaluated today, but it didn't look good. He
needed help walking down the dugout stairs and was in obvious pain.
</P>
<P>
   If Hundley's injury forces him to the disabled list, he'll be
the fifth starter to be there this season. Currently, center
fielder Devon White and third baseman Adrian Beltre are on the
15-day disabled list. Elster and right-hander Kevin Brown spent
time on the disabled list earlier this season.
</P>
<P>
   Pitchers Gregg Olson and Jeff Williams are also on the disabled
list, and right-hander Mike Fetters spent three weeks on the DL
before returning Friday.

 &HT;    Save Our Scraps! Art lovers unite to preserve the Cathedral of
Junk
 &HT;    By John Kelso
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ A group of Austin artists, high-tech people and
other yard art lovers has formed a nonprofit folk art foundation to
save a South Austin tower of junk known as the Cathedral of Junk.
</P>
<P>
   ``The outpouring is pretty incredible,'' said Bill Narum, an
Austin Web page designer, video game maker and former Armadillo
World Headquarters poster artist who is leading the move to
preserve the 32-foot-tall stack of coffee makers, bicycles,
urinals, McDonald's Happy Meal toys, blenders, riding mowers, bed
springs and what-all created by artist Vince Hannemann. ``Not only
the public was so interested in the preservation of it, but the
artists were behind it. So far, it's been unanimous support from
the local artists.''
</P>
<P>
   Narum says he even has the support of Billy Gibbons of ZZ Top.
</P>
<P>
   Others involved include fellow Armadillo artists Jim Franklin
and Micael Priest, Austin artist Bob ``Daddy-O'' Wade, TV producer
Jessica Thomas and Gary Fortin of the broadband Internet
infrastructure provider Aperian. They have been meeting to plan how
to save the tower in the back yard of Hannemann's little South
Austin rent house on Lareina Drive.
</P>
<P>
   The person they're trying to save the tower from is Hannemann
himself. Even though the sometimes-cranky Hannemann spent 11 years
wiring the items in the tower together, he is tired of dealing with
people coming to visit the structure and had begun taking it apart.
To preserve the tower of skateboard parts, pinball machines,
crutches, carburetors and just about any piece of junk you can
imagine, Narum and friends have created a nonprofit organization
called the Austin Folk Art Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   The foundation, Narum said, intends to raise money to buy the
house where Hannemann lives and to pay Hannemann $10,000 for the
sculpture so that he will move out and go away. One idea is to hire
another artist to live in the house and give tours of the junk.
Hannemann has said he wants to move to a small town and build an
even larger tower of junk.
</P>
<P>
   ``The good news is that Johnson City is too close for Vince,''
Narum said.
</P>
<P>
   Fortin, Aperian's vice president of marketing, is talking about
putting up some of his own money to save the junk.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's Austin's first significant piece of folk art that is in
jeopardy of being torn apart,'' he said. ``I think it's a great
opportunity for the high-tech community _ the multimedia cluster _
to come over to the south side of the river and make a
difference.''
</P>
<P>
   Narum estimates the asking price for the small house will be
about $45,000, and the group needs an operating budget to maintain
the site. ``We don't want to buy it and just let it rot,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Narum says the group already has enough money pledged to cover
the sculpture. His biggest problem has been Hannemann. When members
of the folk art foundation stopped by Hannemann's place for a tour
on a recent weekend, they discovered Hannemann was still taking his
piece apart. Narum, who had thought Hannemann had stopped
dismantling the tower, says he went ballistic on Hannemann and a
shouting match began. Only in South Austin would people argue over
junk preservation. Narum says he even used the ``A'' word on
Hannemann.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to blow up on him,'' Narum said. ``I got in a screaming
match with him with a bunch of supporters over there.'' Narum added
that the situation ended amicably when Cathedral of Junk supporters
gave Hannemann $500 to leave his artwork alone, until the full
$10,000 payment can be raised. ``After that we shook hands and made
up,'' Narum said.
</P>
<P>
   Hannemann says he had told Narum he was going to take down the
tower until he got some earnest money. ``Yeah, we had a little
misunderstanding; let's put it that way,'' Hannemann said. ``I had
been up front with him that I was going to dismantle it until they
gave me some money.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas, who has produced shows for the Austin Music Network,
thinks the Austin Folk Art Foundation could save other folk art
around town. ``Who knows what's out there and hasn't been talked
about?'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   So if you have a pile of trash at the end of your street, give
me a call and maybe we can find it a docent.

 &HT;    Cincinnati and pigs: Pure ham
 &HT;    By Mary McCarty
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Maybe you had to have been there, back in the Great Flying Pig
Debate of 1988, to get such a kick out of the fiberglass pigs
roaming the streets of Cincinnati. The Big Pig Gig boasts 375 pigs,
to be precise, designed by local artists a la Chicago's Cows on
Parade. (A tuxedoed pig at Music Hall; Pigasso at the Art Museum _
you get the idea.)
</P>
<P>
   I don't know if this says more about me or about Cincinnati, but
the pigscapade was my favorite controversy in all my years as a
reporter in Cincinnati.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody got hurt. But boy, was there ever a spectacle.
</P>
<P>
   It all started with artist Andrew Leicester's plans for a public
sculpture in Sawyer Point Park. The four pink, red-winged pigs atop
riverboat smokestacks were intended as a whimsical tribute to
Cincinnati's 19th-century status as Porkopolis.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal drew the ire of some city officials _ notably once
and future Mayor Charlie Luken and future Congressman Steve Chabot
_ who felt the swine presented a less-than-dignified image of their
city.
</P>
<P>
   The controversy went national. ``Why would a city with a team
like the Bengals be worried about flying pigs?'' quipped Bryant
Gumbel on the Today show.
</P>
<P>
   Things came to a head at a raucous public hearing of
Cincinnati's Urban Development Committee. A local DJ strolled City
Council Chambers cuddling a Butler County pig named Arnold,
announcing, ``We're pro-pig and we want the world to know it.''
Artists linked arms and sang, ``All we are sa-a-a-y-ing is give
pigs a chance.''
</P>
<P>
   Three of the five committee members donned felt pig hats.
Council member Arn Bortz donned a pig snout.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting was expected to drum up public opposition to the
pigs and the ``elite arts community.'' Instead, it turned into a
lovefest for the pigs.
</P>
<P>
   Chabot was roundly booed when he declared, ``I am neither
pro-pig nor anti-pig.'' (Being one of the House managers in the
impeachment trial must have been a breeze by comparison.)
</P>
<P>
   Beneath Luken's chair hung a Magic-Markered poster of
Charlotte's web with those immortal words, ``Some pig.''
</P>
<P>
   In all the clamor you could hear a battle for the city's image.
Were we a laugh-at-ourselves, whimsical city, or the stodgy,
repressive place the rest of the world liked to imagine us?
</P>
<P>
   Ever since then, Cincinnati has embraced its porcine heritage,
hosting the annual Flying Pig Marathon and Bockfest Pig Parade.
</P>
<P>
   Pig pride has never been so rampant in Cincinnati. (Check them
out in person through Oct. 31 or visit them online at
www.bigpiggig.com.) Make the acquaintance of ``Hogwarts,'' a hammy
Harry Potter, complete with spectacles and broomstick. ``Pigs were
Cincinnati's original waste management system,'' artist Liz
Duquette told The Cincinnati Enquirer. ``That's why we asked Rumpke
to be our sponsor.''
</P>
<P>
   What does it take for one individual to admit, in public, ``I
was wrong?'' Plenty, it seems, any more, when such a statement
seems tantamount to an admission of weakness.
</P>
<P>
   What does it take for an entire city to admit, ``I was wrong?''
When will that happen?
</P>
<P>
   In Cincinnati, the answer appears to be, ``When pigs fly.''

 &HT;    Standardized tests a fair way to assess skills for all students
 &HT;    By Rowland Nethaway
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's illogical, unfair and wrong to compare standardized tests
used to measure academic achievement in public schools with Jim
Crow tests used to discriminate against African Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Crow tests were used by racist southern officials to deny
blacks their constitutional rights. They were shameful barriers to
minority equality.
</P>
<P>
   The president of the NAACP Legal Defense and Education Fund has
compared standardized tests used in many public schools with racist
tests used to keep blacks from voting or getting into traditionally
white schools or professions.
</P>
<P>
   The standardized tests used in Texas, and especially in Waco,
are designed to tear down barriers to educational equality,
particularly for minorities and economically disadvantaged
students.
</P>
<P>
   Tearing down barriers to achieve equality can hardly be compared
to erecting barriers to deny equality.
</P>
<P>
   The reason NAACP officials complain about standardized tests is
because the tests are showing that many African Americans are
scoring behind white students on scholastic achievement.
</P>
<P>
   Unless the tests are racially or culturally biased, there is no
reason to blame the tests for the results. Most widely administered
standardized tests are painstakingly vetted to be as free of racial
or cultural bias as humanly possible.
</P>
<P>
   The fact is that school children across the nation have been let
down by public school systems that substituted sensitive, feel-good
gimmicks for the hard work of teaching, testing and learning.
</P>
<P>
   Students most hurt by the social promotions and politically
correct edubabble that dominated America's education community for
30 years were minority and economically disadvantaged students.
</P>
<P>
   Until recent efforts to ensure that public school students can
once again read their diplomas and obtain the skills needed to hold
down decent jobs, public schools studiously ignored accountability
at all levels of the educational process.
</P>
<P>
   Parents were not held accountable for their responsibility to
oversee their children's educational progress.
</P>
<P>
   Teachers were not held accountable for their responsibility to
teach their students enough to succeed in a higher grade.
</P>
<P>
   School administrators and trustees were not held accountable for
their refusal to hold anyone in their school districts accountable
for the downward spiral of public education.
</P>
<P>
   Out of fear of traumatizing students, the curriculum was watered
down, tests were dumbed down, grading was based on intentions, not
results, and students were promoted to higher grades when they had
not learned the material in their current grade.
</P>
<P>
   Hurt the most by more than a generation of social promotions
were minority and economically disadvantaged students.
</P>
<P>
   Students from middle and upper-income families with a heritage
of educational attainment were least hurt.
</P>
<P>
   NAACP officials would be more on target if they blasted the past
three decades of slacker education for the current testing gap
between minorities and whites.
</P>
<P>
   Standardized tests should be based on grade-level curriculum.
</P>
<P>
   Promotions should not be based on standardized test results
alone. Attendance and classroom work also should be considered.
</P>
<P>
   School districts need to be committed to fund and staff extra
classes to keep students from falling behind. These extra classes
must be conducted during the school year as well as during the
summer.
</P>
<P>
   Standardized tests and accountability measures must be directed
at preventing children from falling behind, not increasing academic
failures.
</P>
<P>
   There is no reason to blame or get angry with standardized
tests.
</P>
<P>
   Standardized tests simply measure learning. We need them the
same way motorists need to measure how fast they are going or how
much gas they have in their tanks.
</P>
<P>
   Standardized tests can always be made better, but they are not
the enemy.

an answer. Call 404-222-2002, or write him at The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution, P.O. Box 4689, Atlanta, Ga. 30302, or e-mail

<P>
   Q: A recent article contained a statement from someone who said
it was ``impossible for my brother to defend himself against these
Kafkaesque proceedings.'' What is meant by that?
</P>
<P>
   A: Derived from the name of Czech writer Franz Kafka
(1883-1924), ``Kafkaesque'' means surreal, nightmarish persecution.
</P>
<P>
   Kafka's works, written in German, combine a realistic, sometimes
grotesquely exact description of details with an overall atmosphere
of fantasies, dreams and nightmares. People find themselves trapped
in inexplicable, confusingly complex situations in which there is
no way out. The word conjures up the confusion, anxieties and
alienation of modern man. The article you saw reported on a case
involving the 1996 anti-terrorism act, which gives the Immigration
and Naturalization Service the authority to arrest, detain and
deport non-citizens based on secret evidence not revealed to the
defendant.
</P>
<P>
   Q: When and where was the first shopping mall built in the
United States?
</P>
<P>
   A: The book ``Famous First Facts'' lists it as Country Club
Plaza, on the outskirts of Kansas City, Mo. Construction began in
November 1922, and the first tenant moved in in March 1923. The
center occupied 40 acres and had 150 stores, a 2,000-seat
auditorium, and a parking lot for 5,500 cars.
</P>
<P>
   The first shopping plaza in which the stores faced in toward a
promenade, rather than out toward an access road, was the Highland
Park Shopping Village in Dallas, built in 1931.
</P>
<P>
   Q: It was reported last fall that an elephant inThailand needed
a foot amputation after she stepped on a land mine. Is any update
available on her condition?
</P>
<P>
   A: At last report, veterinarians at Thailand's leading pachyderm
hospital said Motola, the injured elephant, was in good health and
eating 600 pounds of food a day.
</P>
<P>
   A five-man surgical team amputated the 38-year-old animal's left
front foot after it stepped on a mine while hunting for food on the
rugged border between Thailand and Myanmar (formerly Burma).
</P>
<P>
   The animal's plight garnered worldwide attention and offers of
help, including more than $120,000 in donations. Motola's survival
was in doubt for weeks after the amputation in August, but by
December her condition had improved to the point that she was moved
from her pen to an area where she could practice walking.
</P>
<P>
   Veterinarians said fitting her with a prosthesis was being
considered. An American firm, Riecken's Orthotic Laboratory in
Evansville, Ind., has offered to make a prosthesis.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Why is San Diego's weather always so beautiful, in the low
70s all year long, while just to the north, in Los Angeles,
temperatures sometimes soar over 100 degrees?
</P>
<P>
   A: Actually, both cities _ which are about 125 miles apart _
have remarkably similar weather.
</P>
<P>
   The climate in both is termed Marine or Mediterranean. The
primary moderating influence is the Pacific Ocean, with coastal
mountain ranges acting as a buffer against extremes of summer heat
and winter cold to the east.
</P>
<P>
   A high over 100 is quite the exception in either city. Los
Angeles averages only five days a year with temperatures of 90 or
higher; San Diego averages three. It's possible, by the way, for
temperatures to top 100 in San Diego, primarily in the eastern
sections of the city, when dry easterly winds blow for several
days. But it's rare.
</P>
<P>
   Nor does either city have extremes of cold. There are no days
with temperatures of 32 degrees or below. Both cities also average
relatively little annual precipitation (12 inches in Los Angeles,
9.9 inches in San Diego), and average humidity levels are about the
same (69 percent in San Diego, 71 percent in Los Angeles).
</P>
<P>
   As the Weather Almanac notes, pronounced differences in
temperatures can occur in both cities within fairly short
distances.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I know that George W. Bush was released early from the
National Guard to attend Harvard Business School. But did he, in
fact, receive a degree?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes. He received his MBA in 1975. He received his
undergraduate degree from Yale in 1968, and enrolled at Harvard
after getting out of the Texas Air National Guard in 1973.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I saw an article the other day concerning a possible advance
in the treatment of diabetes, specifically transplantation of human
pancreatic islet cells. Where can I get more information?
</P>
<P>
   A: The American Society of Transplantation says information can
be found online at www.transplant2000.org.
</P>
<P>
   Pioneering work on the process, in which eight patients were
liberated from insulin injections by having pancreas cells from
dead donors transplanted into their livers, was done by
British-born surgeon James Shapiro of the University of Alberta.
Shapiro described his work at a recent meeting in Chicago of the
American Society of Transplant Surgeons and the American Society of
Transplantation.
</P>
<P>
   The cells that produce insulin are called the Islets of
Langerhans. In those who develop diabetes as children, the islets
are destroyed. Attempts have been made to transplant islet cells,
or in the entire pancreas, but have had limited success and
involved lengthy hospitalization.
</P>
<P>
   In the new approach, the islets are injected into veins, a
simple procedure not requiring a surgeon and involving, at most, an
overnight hospital stay. Getting a sufficient supply of islets is
seen to be a problem, but may be overcome in the future by cloning
techniques.
</P>
<P>
   If the technique continues to prove successful in further
research, demand for the treatment _ and costs _ are expected to be
high.
</P>
<P>
   Q: The move to disbar President Clinton brings to mind Richard
Nixon. Was he disbarred from the practice of law after his
resignation as president?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes. On July 8, 1976, Nixon was disbarred by a New York
court, marking the first time the former president had been found
guilty by an official body of charges relating to Watergate. That
action meant he could not practice law in any form in New York and
could not appear as a lawyer before any court or agency, or give
legal advice, in the state.
</P>
<P>
   Nixon, who previously had said he never intended to practice law
again, already had resigned from the bars of California and the
U.S. Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   The court sustained five charges brought by the Association of
the Bar of the City of New York that Nixon had obstructed ``the due
administration of justice'' and thus violated the Code of
Professional Responsibility, a set of rules that all lawyers are
required to observe. The charges weren't contested by Nixon.
</P>
<P>
   In its 4-to-1 opinion, the court, which had admitted Nixon to
practice law in New York in 1963, found that the charges were
substantiated by documentary evidence, such as the tapes of Nixon
himself, excerpts of testimony of individuals given to various
congressional committees, and affidavits.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Who is credited with writing the song ``Happy Birthday''?
</P>
<P>
   A: Facts on File Encyclopedia of Word and Phrase Origins
explains that it was written in 1893 by Patty Smith Hill
(1868-1946) and Mildred Jane Hill (1859-1916) as part of their
``Song Stories for the Kindergarten.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: What's the background on Atlanta Braves rookie shortstop
Rafael Furcal? A recent article described him as a candidate for
rookie of the year.
</P>
<P>
   A: To start at the beginning, Rafael Antoni Furcal as born Aug.
24, 1980, in Loma de Cabrera, Dominican Republic, where he still
lives in the off-season.
</P>
<P>
   He was signed by the Braves as a free agent on Nov. 9, 1996. In
1998, he played on the Appalachian League's Danville, Va., team,
where he had a ``standout campaign,'' as the Braves put it. He
batted .328 in 66 games and stole a league record 60 bases. He was
named Danville's player of the year that year.
</P>
<P>
   In 1999 he was named the Braves' top minor league prospect by
Baseball America after compiling a ``sensational campaign'' with
Class A Macon and Class A Myrtle Beach while being converted from
second base to shortstop. He led all of minor league baseball with
96 steals in 126 attempts and was named the South Atlantic League's
top prospect after leading the circuit with 73 steals in only 83
games.
</P>

<P>
   One of the most enduring figures in popular music, Mathis has
recorded more than 100 albums, including many that have become
milestones in 20th century popular culture. He has garnered more
than 60 gold and platinum album awards since his arrival on the
music scene in the mid-1950s.
</P>
<P>
   His latest CD is ``Mathis on Broadway,'' a collection of
contemporary show tunes released recently by Columbia Records. It
features duets with Broadway award-winners Betty Buckley, Nell
Carter and Forever Plaid, and is Mathis' first collection of
theater tunes since the ``Rhythms and Ballads of Broadway'' album
in 1960.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Q&AMP;A recently discussed the motto ``In God We Trust'' on
coins. How did that start?
</P>
<P>
   A: Although it was used by Francis Scott Key in a slightly
different form when he wrote ``The Star-Spangled Banner'' in 1814,
it originated as an inscription for U.S. coins during the Civil
War.
</P>
<P>
   On Nov. 13, 1861, when Union morale had been shaken by
battlefield defeats, Rev. M.R. Watkinson of Ridleyville, Pa., wrote
to Treasury Secretary Salmon P. Chase. ``From my heart I have felt
our national shame in disowning God as not the least of our present
national disasters,'' Watkinson wrote, suggesting ``recognition of
Almighty God in some form on our coins.''
</P>
<P>
   Chase ordered designs prepared with the inscription ``In God We
Trust'' and endorsed coinage legislation authorizing use of the
slogan. It first appeared on some U.S. coins in 1864, and
disappeared and reappeared on various coins until 1955, when
Congress ordered it placed on all paper money and all coins.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Articles about polls always refer to a margin of error. Can
you explain what that means, and how it was developed?
</P>
<P>
   A: The Gallup Organization explains that over the years,
statisticians have developed quite specific ways of measuring the
accuracy of samples _ as long as the fundamental principle of equal
probability of selection is adhered to when the sample is drawn.
</P>
<P>
   For example, with a sample size of 1,000 national adults
(derived using careful random selection procedures), the results
are highly likely to be accurate within a margin of error of plus
or minus 3 percentage points. Thus, if it is found in a given poll
that a president's approval rating is 50 percent, the margin of
error indicates that the true rating is very likely to be between
47 and 53 percent. It's very unlikely to be higher or lower,
according to Gallup.
</P>
<P>
   To be more specific, Gallup says the laws of probability show
that if the same survey were conducted 100 times, asking people in
each survey to rate the job a president is doing, in 95 out of
those 100 polls the rating would be between 47 and 53 percent. In
only five _ because of chance error _ would the rating be higher or
lower than that.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I was told that Walt Disney World is located on property that
formerly was the site of McCoy Air Force Base. Can you confirm?
</P>
<P>
   A: Wrong site. McCoy became the site of Orlando's airport, not
Disney World.
</P>
<P>
   McCoy Air Force Base was closed in 1974. The following year, the
surplus land was deeded to the City of Orlando for airport facility
use, and the Greater Orlando Aviation Authority was created by
special legislative act. In 1976 it received international airport
status and was renamed Orlando International Airport.
</P>
<P>
   The Disney World site is southwest of Orlando, off I-4 near Lake
Buena Vista. The airport is southeast of Orlando, off the Beeline
Expressway.
</P>
<P>
   And now, incidentally, you know why the airport designator code
for Orlando International Airport is MCO. It's derived from McCoy.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I know the word kamikaze came into the language when Japanese
pilots staged suicide attacks in World War II, but what is the
literal meaning?
</P>
<P>
   A: It cAAmerican Society of Transplantation.
</P>
<P>

Langerhans. In those who develop diabetes as children, the islets
are destroyed. Attempts have been made to transplant islet cells,

<P>
   Q: When a Postal Service truck is pulled over to the side of a
street to put mail into a mailbox, are other motorists expected or
required to yield to them? Or do they have to yield to the other
traffic?
</P>
<P>
   A: There are no specific U.S. Postal Service policies governing
the behavior of motorists while in the vicinity of postal delivery
vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   However, given the growing amount of traffic congestion on
Atlanta-area streets and roads, motorists certainly can increase
the comfort level of letter carriers by watching out for them and
yielding to them when they're making deliveries to roadside
mailboxes, said Postal Service spokesman Michael Miles.
</P>
<P>
   Q: At a recent state dinner, South African President Thabo Mbeki
presented President Clinton with a set of 24-karat gold coins
produced by the South African Mint. What happens to such gifts, and
who or what agency oversees the handling of them?
</P>
<P>
   A: The State Department Protocol Office physically handles the
exchange of gifts between heads of state, according to the White
House. Those received by any U.S. president are forwarded by the
State Department to the White House to be put on display in the
Oval Office or elsewhere in the ceremonial rooms of the White
House. The White House Gift Unit oversees placement.
</P>
<P>
   After that, gifts and other materials given to the president by
visiting heads of state go to the National Archives, where they are
held until a presidential library is built. At that point, they go
on display on an official basis.
</P>
<P>
   In the case you're inquiring about, Mbeki presented to Clinton a
limited edition legal tender proof coin set, the Natura Prestige
Set 2000. It consists of four 24-karat coins from the 2000 ``The
Sable-Queen of the Antelope'' collection, which is second in the
South African Mint's ``The Monarchs of Africa'' series.
</P>
<P>
   Mbeki's wife, Zanele, presented to Mrs. Clinton a 12-piece set
of ``Afrisilver'' napkin rings, each napkin featuring a different
animal found in Africa, including a lion, elephant, leopard and
buffalo.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Henry Aaron hit 755 lifetime home runs, making him the
all-time home run leader ahead of Babe Ruth and Willie Mays. How
many times did Aaron hit 50 or more homers in one season?
</P>
<P>
   A: None. Aaron's single-year home run top was in 1971, when he
hit 47. Ruth's top year was 1927, when he hit 60 homers; in 1921,
he hit 59; in 1920 and 1928, 54. Mays' top year was 1965, when he
hit 52; in 1955, he hit 51.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is Johnny Mathis still living? If so, what has he been up to
in recent years? I never hear anything about him any more or see
him on TV.
</P>
<P>
   A: He's very much alive, and when he isn't singing or cooking _
he's a gourmet chef of considerable renown _ usually can be found
on a golf course, playing for his own enjoyment or participating in
golf-related charities. Mathis, 64, lives in a Hollywood Hills
mansion built by Howard Hughes. He cherishes his privacy, and has
described himself in the past as ``a loner, but not lonely.''
</P>
<P>
   He has performed at five U.S. presidential dinners and has
appeared in numerous royal command performances in England. His
appearance on A&AMP;E's Grammy-winning ``Live By Request'' series in
1998 captured the series' highest ratings to date.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most enduring figures in popular music, Mathis has
recorded more than 100 albums, including many that have become
milestones in 20th century popular culture. He has garnered more
than 60 gold and platinum album awards since his arrival on the

Disney World.
</P>
<P>
   McCoy Air Force Base was closed in 1974. The following year, the
surplus land was deeded to the City of Orlando for airport facility
use, and the Greater Orlando Aviation Authority was created by
special legislative act. In 1976 it received international airport
status and was renamed Orlando International Airport.
</P>
<P>
   The Disney World site is southwest of Orlando, off I-4 near Lake
Buena Vista. The airport is southeast of Orlando, off the Beeline
Expressway.
</P>
<P>
   And now, incidentally, you know why the airport designator code
for Orlando International Airport is MCO. It's derived from McCoy.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I know the word kamikaze came into the language when Japanese
pilots staged suicide attacks in World War II, but what is the
literal meaning?
</P>
<P>
   A: It comes from the Japanese kami (god or deity) and kaze
(wind): thus, ``divine wind.'' It is traced to 1281, when a typhoon
_ hence, ``wind of the gods'' _ wrecked a Mongol fleet invading
Japan. Since World War II, the term has been used in English for
anyone or anything displaying recklessness.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What is known about mouth and throat cancer from smoking
cigars and pipes?
</P>
<P>
   A: The American Lung Association and the American Health
Foundation say cigar and pipe smokers face risks of lung, larynx,
mouth and esophagus cancer; chronic pulmonary disease; and heart
problems, including those caused when nicotine is absorbed into the
bloodstream.
</P>
<P>
   Even passive smoke from cigars and pipes can be harmful to
others, according to health researchers. Because cigar and pipe
tobacco burn at a lower temperatures than cigarette tobacco, the
smoke they release may contain higher concentrations of carbon
monoxide and cancer-causing substances such as nitrosamine.
</P>
<P>
   Health experts also refute the oft-held idea that risks are
lessened if people switch from cigarettes to pipes and cigars,
thinking they won't inhale. This is a myth, the experts say,
because the habit of inhalation is likely to continue.
</P>

Association); www.ahf.org/ (American Health Foundation).

   HAVANA, Cuba _ It's a sweltering Sunday afternoon, the
temperature fueled by a blazing Caribbean sun and the scorching
African rhythms floating skyward from a narrow alley tucked in an
otherwise nondescript corner of this capital city.
</P>
<P>
   Drummers pound an incessant beat on tall wooden drums,
triggering waves of swaying, hypnotic dance in the crowd of some
200 people jammed into the sweaty space. A young Afro-Cuban woman
wearing a skin-tight body stocking festooned with bright flowers
shimmies, her body rolling with rhythm, while two tall, blonde
European women gently rock to the beat, faces entranced by the
spectacle.
</P>
<P>
   A young American backpacker clad in sandals, shorts and T-shirt,
his chin darkened by a scraggly goatee, rolls his head, eyes
closed, as the drums crescendo.
</P>
<P>
   The throng somehow parts as tall, bearded Salvador Gonzalez
Escalona strolls calmly through the midst of an event he created.
Never breaking a sweat, he smiles as he speaks to acquaintances and
accepts handshakes from strangers, glowing with the energy of a
weekly gathering that has become a cultural and tourist magnet here
in Havana.
</P>
<P>
   ``Welcome to Hammel Alley,'' he tells a visitor in Spanish. ``We
are celebrating our African roots.''
</P>
<P>
   His arm swings out to encompass the two-story buildings crowding
the alley, which are covered with wild, flowing murals Gonzalez has
painted over the past decade to celebrate Cuba's mystical
Afro-Caribbean religion, Santeria.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our religion is very different from yours in the United
States,'' he said. ``It is a philosophy of the forces of nature. My
work responds to the codes and values of our African ancestors.''
</P>
<P>
   The murals incorporate swirling circles, bright orange eyes,
geometric shapes, crosses, scribbled poems and homilies, densely
packed bodies and intriguing faces. Gonzalez is also a sculptor who
recycles the objects of everyday life: an ancient cash register
stands on a pedestal; an old black manual typewriter is nailed to a
door; a bathtub on wheels is welded to a frame arching over the
street, a scrap-iron seahorse towing the tub with metal traces.
</P>
<P>
   Fidel Castro may have outlawed religion as the enemy of his
communist state, but Santeria still thrives in Cuba, and Salvador
Gonzalez has become one of its most visible advocates.
</P>
<P>
   He began his mural project in the early 1990s, when as a
struggling artist the idea of taking his paintings to the street on
a grand scale might have seemed risky. Cuba was _ and still is _
ruled by bureaucrats who often issue official decrees as to what
artistic forms and expressions are acceptable.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez, 52, simply started painting. His neighbors loved his
work, and helped him scrounge paint supplies. They helped him build
scaffolds, and set up lights at night to let him work as late as
his muse provided inspiration.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, the official types mostly overlooked him, then
gradually became fans. News of the growing mural spread by
word-of-mouth and it soon became a popular stop with the trickle of
tourists who began showing up in Cuba in the mid-1990s.
</P>
<P>
   By the late '90s, the mural was mostly finished, and Gonzalez
had carved out a spot as a hip representative of Cuban art and
culture. With tourism flourishing, he has become one of Cuba's most
notable artists. Magazine articles and press coverage led to
commissions overseas. He has painted a water tower in Germany, a
huge building in Caracas a homeless shelter in New Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   His subject is the mysterious world of Santeria. The religion
stems from the Yoruba people of West Africa, who kept their beliefs
when they were brought to the New World as slaves. Forbidden by
their masters from practicing their religion, they hid it by
incorporating the Catholic saints as representatives of each of the
Yoruban gods, called orishas.
</P>
<P>
   The orishas rule over every aspect of life and nature, from
relationships to the weather, to mountains, trees and the ocean.
Priests _ or babalawos _ instruct the faithful through sacrifice
and offerings, sometimes tossing pieces of coconut shells seeking
divination, or instructing their adherents to follow intricate,
secret rituals to chase away evil spirits or ensure good luck in
business or love.
</P>
<P>
   The religion also incorporates rhythmic drumming, dance and
trances. Followers can be seen swooning in religious ecstacy, their
bodies apparently possessed by fervor and spirits.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez has brought Santeria from Havana's back alleys into the
light of international attention, earning respect from art lovers
and the admiration of Santeria believers for preserving and
furthering a vital part of Cuban culture.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of life and music in his art,'' said Jacqui
Guillard, who visited Gonzalez's Sunday afternoon gathering
recently on a trip from Switzerland, where she is an artist. ``It's
fascinating and really shows the allure of Cuba _ it's such a
mysterious destination.''
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez clearly thrives on the attention, but insists his real
purpose is to keep alive the religion that has flourished in Cuba
for hundreds of years. He's happy that his art has provided a means
for people outside Cuba to understand a little more about Santeria.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am only a channel for the values of my ancestors,'' he said.
``My art is in homage to them, to their beliefs, to our culture.''

   Gonzalez has brought Santeria from Havana's back alleys into the
light of international attention, earning respect from art lovers
and the admiration of Santeria believers for preserving and
furthering a vital part of Cuban culture.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of life and music in his art,'' said Jacqui
Guillard, who visited Gonzalez's Sunday afternoon gathering
recently on a trip from Switzerland, where she is an artist. ``It's
fascinating and really shows the allure of Cuba _ it's such a
mysterious destination.''
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez clearly thrives on the attention, but insists his real
purpose is to keep alive the religion that has flourished in Cuba
for hundreds of years. He's happy that his art has provided a means
for people outside Cuba to understand a little more about Santeria.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am only a channel for the values of my ancestors,'' he said.
``My art is in homage to them, to their beliefs, to our culture.''

   HAVANA, Cuba _ It's a sweltering Sunday afternoon, the
temperature fueled by a blazing Caribbean sun and the scorching
African rhythms floating skyward from a narrow alley tucked in an
otherwise nondescript corner of this capital city.
</P>
<P>
   Drummers pound an incessant beat on tall wooden drums,
triggering waves of swaying, hypnotic dance in the crowd of some
200 people jammed into the sweaty space. A young Afro-Cuban woman
wearing a skin-tight body stocking festooned with bright flowers
shimmies, her body rolling with rhythm, while two tall, blonde
European women gently rock to the beat, faces entranced by the
spectacle.
</P>
<P>
   A young American backpacker clad in sandals, shorts and T-shirt,
his chin darkened by a scraggly goatee, rolls his head, eyes
closed, as the drums crescendo.
</P>
<P>
   The throng somehow parts as tall, bearded Salvador Gonzalez
Escalona strolls calmly through the midst of an event he created.
Never breaking a sweat, he smiles as he speaks to acquaintances and
accepts handshakes from strangers, glowing with the energy of a
weekly gathering that has become a cultural and tourist magnet here
in Havana.
</P>
<P>
   ``Welcome to Hammel Alley,'' he tells a visitor in Spanish. ``We
are celebrating our African roots.''
</P>
<P>
   His arm swings out to encompass the two-story buildings crowding
the alley, which are covered with wild, flowing murals Gonzalez has
painted over the past decade to celebrate Cuba's mystical
Afro-Caribbean religion, Santeria.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our religion is very different from yours in the United
States,'' he said. ``It is a philosophy of the forces of nature. My
work responds to the codes and values of our African ancestors.''
</P>
<P>
   The murals incorporate swirling circles, bright orange eyes,
geometric shapes, crosses, scribbled poems and homilies, densely
packed bodies and intriguing faces. Gonzalez is also a sculptor who
recycles the objects of everyday life: an ancient cash register
stands on a pedestal; an old black manual typewriter is nailed to a
door; a bathtub on wheels is welded to a frame arching over the
street, a scrap-iron seahorse towing the tub with metal traces.
</P>
<P>
   Fidel Castro may have outlawed religion as the enemy of his
communist state, but Santeria still thrives in Cuba, and Salvador
Gonzalez has become one of its most visible advocates.
</P>
<P>
   He began his mural project in the early 1990s, when as a
struggling artist the idea of taking his paintings to the street on
a grand scale might have seemed risky. Cuba was _ and still is _
ruled by bureaucrats who often issue official decrees as to what
artistic forms and expressions are acceptable.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez, 52, simply started painting. His neighbors loved his
work, and helped him scrounge paint supplies. They helped him build
scaffolds, and set up lights at night to let him work as late as
his muse provided inspiration.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, the official types mostly overlooked him, then
gradually became fans. News of the growing mural spread by
word-of-mouth and it soon became a popular stop with the trickle of
tourists who began showing up in Cuba in the mid-1990s.
</P>
<P>
   By the late '90s, the mural was mostly finished, and Gonzalez
had carved out a spot as a hip representative of Cuban art and
culture. With tourism flourishing, he has become one of Cuba's most
notable artists. Magazine articles and press coverage led to
commissions overseas. He has painted a water tower in Germany, a
huge building in Caracas a homeless shelter in New Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   His subject is the mysterious world of Santeria. The religion
stems from the Yoruba people of West Africa, who kept their beliefs
when they were brought to the New World as slaves. Forbidden by
their masters from practicing their religion, they hid it by
incorporating the Catholic saints as representatives of each of the
Yoruban gods, called orishas.
</P>
<P>
   The orishas rule over every aspect of life and nature, from
relationships to the weather, to mountains, trees and the ocean.
Priests _ or babalawos _ instruct the faithful through sacrifice
and offerings, sometimes tossing pieces of coconut shells seeking
divination, or instructing their adherents to follow intricate,
secret rituals to chase away evil spirits or ensure good luck in
business or love.
</P>
<P>
   The religion also incorporates rhythmic drumming, dance and
trances. Followers can be seen swooning in religious ecstacy, their
bodies apparently possessed by fervor and spirits.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez has brought Santeria from Havana's back alleys into the
light of international attention, earning respect from art lovers
and the admiration of Santeria believers for preserving and
furthering a vital part of Cuban culture.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of life and music in his art,'' said Jacqui
Guillard, who visited Gonzalez's Sunday afternoon gathering
recently on a trip from Switzerland, where she is an artist. ``It's
fascinating and really shows the allure of Cuba _ it's such a
mysterious destination.''
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez clearly thrives on the attention, but insists his real
purpose is to keep alive the religion that has flourished in Cuba
for hundreds of years. He's happy that his art has provided a means
for people outside Cuba to understand a little more about Santeria.

didn't want a big aqua rectangle to overpower her landscape. He
wanted a detached home office. She had her heart set on a guest
house that would double as a cabana. Through careful planning, the
Duanes created a versatile setting behind their Alpharetta area

<P>
   Every few weeks, some Silicon Valley startup tries to lure Mary
Morse, a software engineer, away from Autodesk Inc. a
computer-aided design company in San Rafael, Calif. At least one of
them has dangled an options package that could have made her rich
by now.
</P>
<P>
   But Morse invariably says thanks, but no thanks. The reason she
is staying put, she says, is simple: She likes her bosses.
</P>
<P>
   There is a lesson here for managers that they will ignore at
their peril in the current job market. Being a tough guy might have
worked a decade ago when corporate America was downsizing and
laying off workers by the millions. But that era, exemplified by
Albert J. ``Chainsaw Al'' Dunlap, the roving chief executive who
boasted about how many people he had fired in order to raise his
companies' stock price, is over.
</P>
<P>
   The American workplace has evolved into a kinder, gentler phase.
With unemployment at a 30-year low, bosses realize that they have
to do more than pay good salaries and lavish perks on their
employees if they want to keep them. They also have to be nice to
them.
</P>
<P>
   And now comes a Gallup Organization study that shows that most
workers rate having a caring boss even higher than money or fringe
benefits. In interviews with 2 million employees at 700 companies,
Gallup found that how long employees stay at companies and how
productive they are is determined by their relationship with the
immediate supervisor. ``People join companies and leave managers,''
said Marcus Buckingham, a senior managing consultant at Gallup and
the primary analyst for the study.
</P>
<P>
   Morse's two-year career at Autodesk is Exhibit A for that
reality. She has worked under several managers so far, she said,
and they have all gone out of their way to please her. The first
one guided her through a six-month internship, accommodating her
college schedule and providing time off for finals. The second
sealed her loyalty to the company by insisting on paying her $5,000
more than she requested as her starting salary.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think what he said without saying it was, `You're more
valuable than even that and I'm going to give you what your
worth,''' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Then that manager's supervisor approached her unexpectedly and
asked to be her mentor _ an offer that she says filled her with
``shock, amazement and delight.''
</P>
<P>
   She accepted, and the supervisor asked her to draw up a list of
short-term and long-term goals. Then, she provided her with a list
of training courses, both inside and outside the company, that
would help her meet those objectives. And finally, she contacted
Morse's boss to make sure he would give her the time off to take
the classes.
</P>
<P>
   Enter boss No. 3, David Lein, Autodesk's automation manager.
Lein, Morse said, summoned her to his office from time to time to
discuss her career hopes. After she completed a project for the
redesign of a large piece of computer code, he asked her what she
wanted to do next. When she said she wanted to be a software
engineer, he recommended classes and gave her the time off to go.
</P>
<P>
   Two months ago, Lein got together with other managers to arrange
for her transfer to a testing position, even though she lacked the
experience that was supposedly required for the position. While not
technically a promotion, the job required more expertise than her
previous one and was a logical step to a higher-paying job.
</P>
<P>
   All the kindness she has received over the last two years, Morse
says, is literally worth a million dollars to her. Before she
joined Autodesk, and again nine months after her arrival, she was
wooed by a telecommunications company that specializes in
high-speed data transfer.
</P>
<P>
   Both times, she says, the company had not yet gone public and
offered her 7,000 stock options at an exercise price of less than
$1 a share. She was tempted, but rejected the offer after she was
told that although she had career aspirations for software
development, the company would not honor them. The interviewer told
her, she said, ``If I hire you, you'll remain here in testing.''
</P>
<P>
   Had she accepted, she would be sitting on options worth $1
million at the current stock price. But she has no regrets. People
at the company that wanted to hire her tell her they are bored and
frustrated. ``The general feeling is that they are putting in their
time,'' waiting for their options to be vested so they can bail
out, she said.
</P>
<P>
   And friends at other Silicon Valley firms complain to her that
they have trouble getting up in the morning, telling her, she says:
``This thing worked out great, but I'm miserable.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; BC-R-NICE-BOSSES-ART-2NDTAKE-NYT &QL; 
UNDATED: I'm miserable.'' &LR;  &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Workplace specialists say Morse's experience is not unusual _
nor is the unhappiness of her acquaintances at other companies. The
No. 1 reason people quit their jobs, they say, is dissatisfaction
with their supervisors, not their paychecks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's taken a tight labor market for employers to think though
the social contract they are striking with people,'' says Charles
A. O'Reilly III, visiting professor at the Harvard Business School
and co-author ``Hidden Value: How Great Companies Achieve
Extraordinary Results with Ordinary People,'' which is to be
published this year by the Harvard Business School Press. ``When
job opportunities are plentiful, people with crummy bosses leave.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, they are four times more likely to leave than are
people with nice bosses, according to a 1999 study conducted
jointly by Spherion, a staffing and consulting firm in Fort
Lauderdale, Fla., and Lou Harris Associates. In the survey, only 11
percent of employees who rated their supervisor's performance as
excellent said they were likely to look for a job in the next year,
while 40 percent of those who rated their supervisors' performance
as poor were likely to jump ship.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, there are plenty of bosses out there with mean
streaks, especially in highly competitive industries like
movie-making or macho strongholds like oil. Scott B. MacKenzie, a
professor at Indiana University's Kelley School of Business who has
studied workplace behavior for several years, says ``jerks'' can
still rise to the top if they are stellar performers.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, being nice to employees is not a magic potion against
defections. The big layoffs of the late 1980s and early '90s all
but destroyed the tradition of loyalty to the company and replaced
it with a new culture of job-hopping. ``With downsizing, companies
began saying, `Don't expect a long-term future here, but keep your
skills up-to-date,''' says Mark Roehling, a professor at the
Haworth School of Business at Western Michigan University.
Employees complied, he says, with the result that many will leave
as soon as a better offer comes along.
</P>
<P>
   What should a company that is plagued by defections do? Change
its ways, advises B. Lynn Ware, an industrial psychologist who
heads Integral Training Systems in Menlo Park, Calif. If a company
learns that a valued employee is disgruntled, it should discuss it
with him. ``You should say something like, `I really want you to
have a better work experience than you've had recently,''' Ware
says.
</P>
<P>
   Some old-economy companies are training managers in the art of
benevolence. Macy's West, a division of Federated Department
Stores, based in San Francisco, recently began a pilot program of
assigning mentors to new managers _ and telling all managers that
up to 35 percent of their compensation would be linked to how well
they retain the people under them.
</P>
<P>
   The policy has apparently encouraged managers to be more
accommodating to employees' needs. Ellen Murrin, a group sales
manager for women's ready-to-wear clothing, for example, said she
was now more likely to grant requests for schedule changes and time
off than she used to be.
</P>
<P>
   Other companies are also pushing their managers to be
friendlier. An International Paper plant in Moss Point, Miss.,
holds morning training sessions on positive reinforcement, and
David Sulik, a paper-machine superintendent, says they have changed
his ways.
</P>
<P>
   He used to hover and watch for mistakes. As a compliment, he
would offer a pat on the back or a curt, ``Good job.'' Now, he has
cut back on the criticism and become more effusive in his praise,
even writing the occasional thank you note to an employee for an
exceptional performance. He also chats with workers more than he
used to.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they trust me more than in the past,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And that trust can pay off. Lein, the manager at Autodesk who
went to bat for Morse, says that he too has had to resist
entreaties from other high-technology companies. He averages two
job offers a week, to say nothing of an avalanche of 200 e-mail
pitches from headhunters that he filters out with a software
program that spots telltale words.
</P>
<P>
   His reason for staying is similar to Morse's. When he looks
around Silicon Valley, he says, ``I see people burning out,
companies going under and never making it to the IPO.
</P>
<P>
   `` Maybe I'm a bit of an anomaly,'' he adds. ``Job satisfaction
and being challenged means as much to me as the money part of it _
just so as long as I feel rewarded.''

 &HT;    FATHERHOOD SUMMIT MOVES FROM TALK TO ACTION
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (l) lifestyle categories.
 &HT;    By BOB DART
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The First National Summit on Fatherhood was
convened in 1996 to ``wake up America'' to the tragedy of absentee
dads. Two years later, the second summit showed how the problem
affects all of society. This week, the third summit will issue a
call for community action.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're now in a position to give people concrete things they
can do,'' said Wade Horn, president of the National Fatherhood
Initiative, a non-partisan advocacy group that promotes
``responsible fatherhood'' and sponsors the summits.
</P>
<P>
   The organization was formed in 1994 to dramatically declare that
dads matter _ especially in a nation where 40 percent of the
children, a total of 24.7 million, live in a home without their
biological fathers.
</P>
<P>
   Although the movement has focused attention on the importance of
fathers, Horn said, the problems have hardly lessened. Either
through out-of-wedlock birth or divorce or separation of their
parents, nearly 2.5 million children will join the ranks of the
fatherless this year.
</P>
<P>
   The previous summits helped establish a ``thriving fatherhood
movement,'' Horn said. ``This event is designed to equip
community-based organizations with the tools they need to help
bring dads back to their children.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It is important that we mobilize communities,'' said Horn, a
child psychologist and former Commissioner for Children, Youth and
Families in the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.
</P>
<P>
   This Third National Summit on Fatherhood will bring hundreds of
politicians, local activists and academicians _ and a few celebrity
dads _ to Washington on Friday and Saturday. Country music star Tim
McGraw, former Buffalo Bills quarterback Jim Kelly, and Detroit
Lions defensive end Robert Porcher are scheduled to receive awards
as ``Fathers of the Year.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We use these awards to tell a compelling story about
fatherhood,'' said Horn. ``These celebrities are deserving dads.''
</P>
<P>
   Along with his wife, Jill, Kelly co-founded the Hunter's Hope
Foundation in 1997 after their son, Hunter, was diagnosed with
Krabbe disease, an inherited, often fatal, affliction of the brain
and nervous system that strikes young children.
</P>
<P>
   After spending his early life absent from his biological father,
former major league pitcher Tug McGraw, Tim McGraw sought him out
and worked to establish a close relationship. Married to country
music singer Faith Hill, McGraw is also a devoted father to their
two children, Horn said.
</P>
<P>
   Porcher is among the NFL's biggest advocates for responsible
fatherhood, appearing on ESPN and other sports media to promote the
issue.
</P>
<P>
   The celebrity recipients will be joined by a fourth Father of
the Year, Joe Jones, the founder of Baltimore's Center for Fathers,
Families and Workplace Development, which helps low-income fathers.
</P>
<P>
   One goal of this year's summit is to ``mobilize whole
communities'' in the movement to find absentee fathers and help
them become meaningful parts of the lives of their children, Horn
said.
</P>
<P>
   The people attending the summit work with organizations in
prisons, schools, churches, businesses, entertainment and
neighborhoods around the country. The sessions include ``Working
With Incarcerated Fathers,'' ``Serving Hispanic Dads,'' ``Working
With At-Home Dads,'' ``Serving Fragile Families,'' ``Legal Issues
for Fathers,'' and ``Whatever Happened to Daddy's Little Girl?''
</P>
<P>
   The third summit starts a new action-oriented phase of the
fatherhood movement _ getting more dads to act responsibly, its
organizers said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most important battles are still before us,'' the NFI said
in a issues paper. ``Achieving attitudinal change may be hard, but
behavioral change is even harder. And that is what our children
need most of all.''

 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   John Sanford's 11th thriller featuring Minneapolis Deputy Police
Chief Lucas Davenport is a grisly look at the world of models,
photographers and socialites.
</P>
<P>
   ``Easy Prey'' (G.P. Putnam's Sons, $25.95, 407 pages) opens with
supermodel Alie'e Mason posing for fashion photographer Amnon
Plain, who is known for outrageous and often disturbing work.
Later, Mason goes to a party at a well-known socialite's home and
is found strangled. Davenport is called to the crime scene, where
another body has been found stuffed in a closet with a huge dent in
the head.
</P>
<P>
   As the media descend on the home, Davenport learns that one of
his undercover cops was at the party checking out the local drug
scene, and Davenport must keep the cop's name out of the papers.
Next the photographer is found murdered, then both of Mason's
parents. There are enough suspects to fill a Cecil B. DeMille epic,
and Davenport suspects there are two murderers.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Davenport's private life is complicated by the
presence of three women _ Jael Corbeau, a former model turned
sculptor, one of Mason's lovers and the photographer's sister and
one of the killers' targets; Weather, Davenport's former lover who
indicates she would like to renew their relationship; and Catrin,
Davenport's college lover who is undergoing a midlife crisis and
seems to want an affair.
</P>
<P>
   The love stuff doesn't slow the pace, because Sandford creates
very strong and independent women who are Davenport's equals. Add
good dialogue, good characters and a twisted plot and once again
Sandford serves up a winner.

   ``Double Shot.'' By Raymond Benson. G.P. Putnam's Sons. $23.95.
258 pages.
</P>
<P>
   The latest attempt to resurrect Ian Fleming's James Bond
franchise is so bad that the author Raymond Benson should be
charged with treason, convicted, put in solitary confinement and
forced to watch ``Barney'' 24 hours a day for the rest of his
natural-born life.
</P>
<P>
   Bond has been on medical leave for three months and is champing
at the bit to get back to work and hunt down the leaders of the
criminal group that calls itself the Union. Never mind that Bond is
having migraines and blackouts. The pain gets so bad that he finds
out where his doctor is dining, follows her home and begs for
medication to get rid of the headaches.
</P>
<P>
   They have sex, of course, and he eventually wakes up and finds
her dead. Not knowing whether he killed her, he dresses and rushes
out of the apartment. He doesn't wipe off his fingerprints from the
things he has touched, doesn't hunt for the missing buttons off his
shirt. Come on, James Bond would not be this stupid.
</P>
<P>
   I could go on and give you the basic outline of this
preposterous story, but I will not insult your intelligence.

   ``Free Fall.'' By Kyle Mills. HarperCollins. $25. 392 pages.
</P>
<P>
   Kyle Mills' third political thriller featuring FBI Agent Mark
Beamon is an explosive addition to the genre.
</P>
<P>
   Beamon has been suspended and given three weeks to decide
whether to plead guilty to obstruction of justice charges or face
prosecution. He breaks up with his girlfriend and accepts a
$300,000 commission to hunt down rock climber Darby Moore, whose
former boyfriend Tristan Newberry has been found murdered in her
van in West Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   However, Beamon doesn't know that Newberry was killed because he
had found a top-secret file called Prodigy that has been buried in
a government warehouse since J. Edgar Hoover's death. The file
contains documented evidence of indiscretions of young men who
Hoover thought might become powerhouses some day. One of those men
wants the file at any cost.
</P>
<P>
   Beamon follows Moore to Thailand, where she has been put in jail
when another friend is murdered. Beamon helps her get away, but
once back in the United States Moore escapes and Beamon is hot on
her trail as other trackers hunt them both. More of her friends are
killed, and eventually Moore must trust Beamon to stay alive.
</P>
<P>
   Taut, fast-paced and full of likable characters, ``Free Fall''
is a well-crafted thriller by a young writer who shows great
potential.

&HT;     PILOTS WANT MORE MINORITIES TO ASCEND TO THE COCKPIT 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By JOHN GUTIERREZ-MIER  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ Calvin Allen, dapper in a crisp black uniform
adorned with pilot wings, always turns a few heads as he makes his
way through busy airports.
</P>
<P>
   Allen doesn't attribute that to his good looks. He is one of the
very few African-American pilots for commercial airlines.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all about our comfort level,'' said Allen, 47, a Delta
Airlines captain who lives in San Antonio. ``People are used to
seeing white airline pilots, but if you're black, female or some
other minority, that's something people aren't used to.''
</P>
<P>
   Some 2,000 pilots from across the country will gather here Aug.
7-13 for the Organization of Black Airline Pilots' annual
convention. Members hope the convention will entice women and
minorities to consider a flying career.
</P>
<P>
   That is a difficult task, admits Allen, who is helping to
coordinate the event.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, there were 122,053 licensed pilots in the United
States, according to the Federal Aviation Administration. Of that
total, 5,366 were women. Federal law prohibits the agency from
tracking pilots by race or ethnicity, said Roland Herwig, an FAA
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   (OBAP, as the Atlanta-based airline pilots' organization is
called, has 1,400 members. The organization also includes
Hispanics, Asians and whites. It was formed in 1976, when
African-American commercial pilots numbered only about 80.)
</P>
<P>
   The actual number of pilots whose livelihood depends on flying _
for national and regional airlines, cargo companies, air charters
or air taxis _ is closer to 77,000. About 6 percent are women, 3.5
percent are Hispanic and 2 percent are black, according to the
Atlanta-based Air Information Resources Inc., a career service for
pilots.
</P>
<P>
   Allen, a former Air Force pilot and 1976 graduate of the Air
Force Academy, said African-Americans have a long history in
aviation, but discrimination and glass ceilings have traditionally
kept them and other minorities out of the cockpits of many
commercial airlines.
</P>
<P>
   The all-black Tuskegee Airmen of World War II fame, for example,
received segregated training at the Tuskegee Institute in Alabama.
Their unit was disbanded after the war, but their air combat record
over Europe shattered racial stereotypes.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, career barriers _ such as height requirement for
pilots that put females at a disadvantage _ have been chiseled away
by lawsuits targeting some of the nation's largest airlines.
</P>
<P>
   Patrice Clarke Washington, the first African-American woman to
serve as a captain for United Parcel Service, remembers the days
when she was the sole black female pilot flying big jets across the
country.
</P>
<P>
   ``I started training in 1979 and entered the market in 1982 at a
time when it was difficult to do because the industry was so
stagnant,'' said Washington, whose husband, Ray, is a pilot for
American Airlines. They live in St. Charles, Ill., a Chicago
suburb.
</P>
<P>
   Washington said co-workers were surprised to see a woman flying
the plane. Even today, she is often mistaken for a flight
attendant.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important that women know that they can do anything they
want,'' she said. ``Unfortunately, there are still too many young
women who don't know they can achieve their wildest dreams.''
</P>
<P>
   Jaime Pacheco, a pilot with Federal Express in Memphis, Tenn.,
and a longtime member of OBAP, said the organization has opened
industry doors for many.
</P>
<P>
   ``There aren't enough minorities out there, but there's a lot of
pressure to have a diversified work force,'' said Pacheco, a former
Navy pilot who also lives in San Antonio. He lamented the fact that
no similar organization exists for Hispanic pilots.
</P>
<P>
   ``OBAP is promoting the same things I want. Although the
pinnacle would be to become a pilot, the organization is there to
provide opportunities for engineers and mechanics as well,''
Pacheco said.
</P>
<P>
   The organization also works closely with military recruiters and
encourages them to actively seek minorities to enlist as pilots.
Allen said there were more black military pilots flying during
World War II than there are today.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unlike their white counterparts, the black pilots were not
allowed to fly commercially'' after the war.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 12,100 Air Force pilots, 10,976 are white males,
according to the Air Force Recruiting Service Headquarters at
Randolph Air Force Base in San Antonio.

&HT;     GE, UNION TALKS LESS TURBULENT THAN LAST ROUND 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By KENNETH AARON  
 &HT;     c.2000 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SCHENECTADY, N.Y. _ When labor officials sat across from General
Electric Co. executives in New York City to begin negotiations on a
new three-year contract, their primary goals were not be much
different from what they were the last time at the bargaining
table.
</P>
<P>
   Job security, increased pension benefits and health care issues
are the major concerns of the Coordinated Bargaining Committee of
GE Unions, which represents 14 labor groups and 37,000 workers of
the Fairfield, Conn.-based company.
</P>
<P>
   The fervor, though, may have subsided since the 1997 go-round.
Then, with bloodletting at Schenectady's GE Power Systems in
mid-flow, a fiery rally preceded the days before talks started.
Union bigwigs from Washington, D.C., trucked up to the Electric
City to stir the troops in the days before negotiations started.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the local job picture is stable and is expected to remain
so. Power Systems sales are projected at $14 billion this year, a
39 percent increase over last year's results. Instead of noise in
Schenectady, IUE rallies leading to the negotiations have been
scheduled for Indiana, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   ``Business is very good here in Schenectady. We're doing very
well _ people are making some good money,'' said Bob Santamoor,
business agent for the 2,000-member IUE Local 301.
</P>
<P>
   The current contract, ratified in 1997, expires June 25.
Negotiations on a new contract began Tuesday. If history is an
accurate crystal ball, negotiations will continue to the wire.
</P>
<P>
   The last set of talks yielded an 8.75 percent raise over the
three-year contract, an extra holiday and commitment by GE to
replace certain workers who take early retirement.
</P>
<P>
   The company is expecting talks to bear fruit, and on time.
``We're cautiously optimistic,'' said company spokesman Gary
Sheffer.
</P>
<P>
   Santamoor said pension issues remain the key concern of
Schenectady union members. With the average age of the Schenectady
union member at 52, retirement issues loom large.
</P>
<P>
   Convincing GE to award an annual cost-of-living increase to
pensioners, as well as other adjustments in the pension formula,
may be a tall order.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether we can get everything we've been asking for is going
to be tough,'' Santamoor said. ``GE just doesn't want to seem to
bend.''
</P>
<P>
   Sheffer said the company periodically boosts pension payments.
It did so earlier this year, and an increase in pension payouts is
fairly guaranteed anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ``In every contract negotiation, there are always some
increases, some improvements,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But if GE grants the request for an annual inflation adjustment
for retirees, it won't be plowing any new turf.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's fairly common in union pension plans to have some kind of
annual increase,'' said Richard Hurd, a professor of labor studies
at Cornell University in Ithaca, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Increases typically are tied to the Consumer Price Index, a
federal gauge that shows the relative cost of a big basket of
items.
</P>
<P>
   The company maintains that it cannot boost pension payments on a
regular basis because it wants to make sure funding is sufficient
for future workers. The unions maintain that GE wants to hold on to
the money because the surplus in its pension fund is reflected in
the company's net income: Last year, more than $1 billion of GE's
$10.7 billion in profits came from the pension fund.
</P>
<P>
   There are other issues, too. Job security is a big one. While
Schenectady employment has been consistent of late, the Coordinated
Bargaining Committee continues to seek assurances that GE will not
outsource its work and also wants to improve the process of
contesting the shipment of jobs elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of different approaches, and we've proposed all
that we can think of,'' said Lauren Asplen, an IUE spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   Sheffer said GE will not embrace any strategy that shackles its
competitiveness.
</P>
<P>
   As far as health care goes, Asplen said early indications show
that GE wants to put a heavier share of insurance costs on workers.
The Coordinated Bargaining Committee is ready to refute arguments
that the company's costs in that arena are up significantly.
</P>
<P>
   ``It might not be true to the extent that they're claiming,''
she said.

&HT;     LAPTOP TROUBLE? JUST CALL FOR ROOM SERVICE 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (EDs: Eirik is CQ)  
 &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ For many business travelers, the failure of a
laptop computer can be the ultimate nightmare.
</P>
<P>
   But if you are staying at the right hotel, there is nothing to
fear. Just pick up the room phone, call the desk and ask for the
``compcierge.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Ritz-Carlton in San Francisco, a 15-member team of
technology butlers works around the clock to fix modems, repair
printers, debug circuit boards and explain the inexplicable
software of guests' portable computers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The requests run the gamut, from `I'm having trouble getting
on the Internet' to `I'm having trouble opening a Word document' to
`My laptop won't boot up,''' said Eirik O'Neal, head of the
technology butler team and systems manager at the Ritz-Carlton.
</P>
<P>
   The service began in January 1999. So far, it has served between
400 and 500 customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``About 60 percent of our guests travel with their laptops; we
really are a business hotel,'' said Ritz-Carlton spokeswoman Angela
Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   The technology butlers don't just fix computers. They also have
wrestled with cranky cell phones and dotty Palm Pilots, Jackson
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a guest who lost his entire Powerpoint presentation,''
she said. ``One of the butlers went up to the room and re-created
the entire presentation for him.''
</P>
<P>
   The service is free and customers love it, technology butler
Paul Savarino said. ``Everyone I deal with is just head-over-heels
happy. They're amazed that such a service exists.''
</P>
<P>
   Another hotel chain, Toronto-based Four Seasons Hotels and
Resorts Inc., began offering its compcierge service two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``We saw that more and more guests were traveling with their
laptops,'' said Susan Maier, spokeswoman for the Chicago
Ritz-Carlton, which is managed by Four Seasons. Over a six-month
period, ``we saw computer-related calls go from about two a week to
about two per day.''
</P>
<P>
   The Chicago hotel's compcierge service has four employees.
</P>
<P>
   ``I carry a cell phone, and I've been awakened at night, say, by
requests from guests who need to print a document for a morning
meeting,'' said Joe Cardinal, who heads the Chicago Ritz-Carlton's
service. ``Most guests' problems involve connectivity, like trying
to get their e-mail or to get on the Internet.''

&HT;     KILLINGS HEIGHTEN TENSION ALONG THE MEXICAN BORDER 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By LISA SANDBERG  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRACKETTVILLE, Texas _ They trek across this harsh terrain by
the thousands, dirt-poor Mexican migrants in a quest for jobs in
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Hungry, thirsty and exhausted, they are accused of trampling
fences, slaughtering small livestock, cutting water lines, breaking
into homes _ enraging the ranchers and other property owners who
for years have watched helplessly as the numbers grow.
</P>
<P>
   The rage has grown to the point where some Americans have taken
justice into their own hands _ shooting and, in two cases, killing
Mexican nationals. These cases have exacerbated the uneasy ethnic
and class tensions that have long existed here and threatened to
draw the United States into a dispute with its southern neighbor.
</P>
<P>
   In the past year, two illegal immigrants have been killed and
three others wounded by landowners. All five were shot from behind.
</P>
<P>
   ``These people are taking the law into their own hands,'' said
the Mexican consul in San Antonio, Juan Jose Martinez. ``Some of
(the victims) weren't even on the men's property when they were
shot. We are very concerned.''
</P>
<P>
   Tommy Lee, the district attorney for a three-county area west of
San Antonio where the five shootings occurred, agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people here want to make a cause celebre out of these
shooters and think that we can just turn our back. ... `He was
trespassing and therefore I had the right to shoot him' doesn't cut
the mustard,'' Lee said.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the United Nations opened an investigation into the
shootings.
</P>
<P>
   A Washington law firm, hired by the Mexican government, is
seeking damages from the U.S. property owners for the victims or
the survivors of those killed.
</P>
<P>
   While the landowners say they do not condone the violence, they
understand the fear and frustration that may have led to it.
</P>
<P>
   The most recent shooting occurred May 13 on a 50-acre parcel of
land near Brackettville, a town of 1,800 people 130 west of San
Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   Sam Blackwood, a 74-year-old property owner, was charged with
murder. He is accused of using a handgun to shoot a 23-year-old
Mexican migrant named Eusebio de Haro from a distance of 100 feet.
</P>
<P>
   The shooting occurred in the late afternoon just after de Haro
and a companion, exhausted and dehydrated after a four-day journey
by foot through this rugged country, approached Blackwood's home
and begged for water.
</P>
<P>
   Their request denied, the companions apparently were obeying
orders to leave the property when de Haro was shot once in the rear
upper leg.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the sheriff arrived 45 minutes later, de Haro had
bled to death.
</P>
<P>
   His companion, Javier Sanchez, 28, is in the custody of U.S.
marshals facing a felony charge of illegal entry following a formal
deportation.
</P>
<P>
   Sympathy for Blackwood, who was been released on $150,000 cash
bond, runs deep among property owners in this desertlike expanse of
terrain along the Edwards Plateau.
</P>
<P>
   Residents, who complain the intruders have grown more
destructive over the years, have established a fund to help pay for
Blackwood's defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the man done it on purpose,'' said Harry White,
59, the manager of a 10,000-acre hunting ranch teeming with exotic
animals which, like Blackwood's property, is located along Farm
Road 674. ``The last thing he wanted was to kill one of them. I can
promise you that.''
</P>
<P>
   Kinney County Sheriff Leland K. Burgess said that while
Blackwood may have acted ``recklessly,'' he said others share blame
for the shooting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't understand why the ranchers don't get together and sue
the Mexican government for failing to keep their people home,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Migrants are not the only new faces in this remote region.
Attracted by this area's inexpensive and starkly beautiful terrain,
retirees from around the United States have flocked here to
purchase sprawling tracts of land, many of which were once part of
vast ranches.
</P>
<P>
   The newcomers are less tolerant of the Mexican trespassers,
longtime residents say.
</P>
<P>
   ``They just don't know what these aliens are going to do,''
White said.
</P>
<P>
   The authorities agree, noting that all four of the suspects
involved in the five shootings are non-native Texans.
</P>
<P>
   Tensions run particularly high along a 5- to 6-mile stretch of
the Rio Grande near Del Rio, where dozens of riverfront residents
on the Vega Verde subdivision say they are virtually under constant
attack from organized Mexican thieves.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they rob you and go across the river, you're out of luck,''
said Bonnie Rosser, an Alabama native who insists bandits scout her
property from across the river. ``We worked hard for our property,
and these people don't come looking just for food and water, they
want the TV and the VCR.''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   An interview with Rosser about recent burglaries turned into a
community gathering as a dozen neighbors arrived to tell their
stories.
</P>
<P>
   ``You call the sheriff when you're being robbed and someone
shows up two to three hours later,'' said Virginia Ferguson, 36, a
New Jersey native who said she and her grandfather have been
burglarized eight times in recent months. On one occasion, thieves
cut through the side of their house and stole $8,000 worth of
valuables, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Ferguson's neighbor, Patrick Bordelon, is accused of shooting
and killing a 16-year-old Mexican in November after the teen-ager
and a group of friends may have tried to burglarize his home.
</P>
<P>
   According to Lee, the district attorney, Bordelon chased Luis
Armando Chavez Vaquera off his property and shot the boy in the
back of the head as the teen was swimming back to Mexico. His
decomposed body was discovered 12 days later.
</P>
<P>
   Released on bond, Bordelon awaits trial for murder.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez Vaquera's grieving parents say Texas' reputation for
harsh justice appears less punishing when the victim is Mexican.
</P>
<P>
   ``They say over there the laws are very strict, but I don't
believe it,'' a tearful Maria del Carmen Vaquera Morrillon said
from the family's dirt-floor shack in Ciudad Acuna, the city across
the river from Del Rio. ``How can you kill someone and get out on
bond? Right now, those people are laughing at the (Texas)
authorities.''
</P>
<P>
   She said her son deserved to be punished for burglary, not
killed.
</P>
<P>
   ``They said he wanted to steal. We would have paid for those
things,'' she said, sobbing and holding a framed picture of her
son.
</P>
<P>
   Eloy Padilla, a Del Rio attorney with Texas Rural Legal Aid,
said no matter how much support Bordelon enjoys on the U.S. side,
Texas laws frown on people being shot from behind.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a guy's walking away and you shoot him in the back, even if
it is in your house, that's murder in the state of Texas, period.
... Just because they are burglars doesn't mean it's an open season
to kill,'' he said.

&HT;     COMPANY TOUTS SIMPLE PROCESS TO DECONTAMINATE DIRT  
 &HT;     (ATTN: N.H., N.Y.)

<P>
   FORD EDWARD, N.Y. _ It can turn a brownfield into a playground
in 20 minutes flat.
</P>
<P>
   That is about how long it takes Environmental Soil Management of
New York LLC to zap pollution out of contaminated dirt, using a
shake-and-bake technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the only treatment option that can prove and guarantee
destruction of contamination,'' said Bob Manz, president of the
company.
</P>
<P>
   For that reason, a host of private businesses and government
agencies flock to the 7.5-acre property located in Fort Edward's
Energy Park industrial complex with their tainted dirt. For $25 to
$40 a ton, ESMI's thermal treatment process virtually erases the
liability associated with owning contaminated sites by recycling
the soil.
</P>
<P>
   The company, which employs 24 people at its location in upstate
New York and another 22 at a similar facility in Loudon, N.H.,
specializes in hydrocarbons _ the long chains of carbon atoms that
constitute gasoline, oils and PCBs, or polychlorinated biphenyls.
</P>
<P>
   The cleaning process is relatively simple: Contaminated dirt is
sorted and screened before being ``baked'' in a large cylindrical
oven that breaks the molecular bonds of contaminants. After 15
minutes of baking, the soil is done.
</P>
<P>
   With other cleanup methods _ such as landfilling, capping and
trapping tainted soil in nonreactive materials like cement _ there
is always the risk that the landowner will be responsible for
contamination coming back to threaten either human health or the
environment.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you put it in a landfill, you're moving a spill from point
A to point B, but your liability stays the same,'' said Mike Craft,
owner of MC Environmental Services, a cleanup company based in
Glens Falls that has taken contaminated dirt to ESMI since it
opened five years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can offer our customers a certificate of treatment which
reduces their liability to the level of contamination that
originally existed in the soil,'' Craft said.
</P>
<P>
   ESMI does not have permits to treat hazardous or highly polluted
solid waste.
</P>
<P>
   Manz said soil investigations are commonplace in business today
as commercial property is transferred from one company to another.
``The majority of the time, some contamination is uncovered and
most likely it's petroleum,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   ESMI spun off from parent D.A. Collins Construction Co. around
the time the federal government enacted a law mandating the upgrade

 &HT;    AFTER 94 YEARS, MEANING OF 'WHOLESOME' FOOD STILL DEBATED
 &HT;    1020&AMP;add. For release Sunday, June 4.
 &HT;    By ELLIOT JASPIN
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In a long tale of horrors, it was among the worst.
</P>
<P>
   A workman slips and falls into a huge vat of meat being rendered
into lard at a packing plant. His bones are fished out, but his
body dissolves and is eventually packaged into ``Durham's Pure Leaf
Lard'' bound for America's kitchens.
</P>
<P>
   This scene from ``The Jungle,'' Upton Sinclair's 1906 novel
about conditions in Chicago's meat-packing industry, shocked the
nation. The U.S. Department of Agriculture launched an
investigation to find if such a thing had actually occurred (it
had), and Congress called hearings to placate a public angry that
it had practiced accidental cannibalism.
</P>
<P>
   The House Agriculture Committee, which convened on June 6, 1906,
was soon embroiled in a debate on what should be covered by a bill
to reform the meat industry.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone agreed that meat ``unfit'' for human consumption should
be banned. But a dispute arose about how the bill should deal with
something that might not hurt a person, but might be ``offensive to
his ideas as to what he will consume.'' The bill said food should
be ``wholesome,'' a term meat industry executives tried but failed
to have removed.
</P>
<P>
   Despite nearly a century of investigations, exposes, regulations
and legislation, the debate that began that June day 94 years ago
is still very much alive. While Congress was clear in 1906 that it
was regulating both the safety and quality of meat, the Agriculture
Department's new science-based inspection system
</P>
<P>
   may be tampering with that mandate.
</P>
<P>
   Under the new inspection rules, which the government started
enforcing in January 1998, traditional ``poke and sniff''
inspections were replaced with a series of tests intended to
monitor critical points in the production process after birds and
animals were slaughtered. Now the same science-based inspection is
being applied to inspections made at the time of slaughter.
</P>
<P>
   While these new experimental rules may protect consumers from
food that will kill or sicken them, the regulations against what
was termed ``loathsome food'' in 1906 have been weakened.
</P>
<P>
   Under the traditional inspection system, federal inspectors
viewed each carcass and culled diseased birds. To make absolutely
certain only healthy birds were used, samples were taken after the
first round of inspections. If a single lesion was found on a
sample, it immediately triggered additional testing. If more
defective birds were discovered, the government clamped
successively stricter controls on the plant.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, the experimental regulations say a certain
percentage of birds can have defects such as sores and scabs and
still be shipped to consumers. That is because the regulations
distinguish between health hazards such as fecal contamination and
flaws such as sores, scabs, pus and tumors which, while repugnant,
the government says are safe to eat.
</P>
<P>
   Depending on the type of defect, the government may or may not
take action. The new regulations say, for example, that 52 percent
of the birds sampled can have sores.
</P>
<P>
   It is clear that the people who framed the original laws
governing meat and poultry were concerned about not only with the
safety, but the quality of their food.
</P>
<P>
   Agriculture Department officials issued a report in 1906 that
said their inspectors condemned cattle which, while not diseased,
had ``repugnant conditions.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Flesh showing any unusual condition is always a source of
apprehension to the American public who do not care to eat meat ...
should it present an offensive appearance,'' the report declared.
</P>
<P>
   At the Agriculture Committee hearings, food industry executives
were less squeamish.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas E. Wilson, a meat packing executive, tried unsuccessfully
to weaken the language in the bill by replacing the words
``unsound, unhealthful, or otherwise unfit for human food'' with a
simple admonition not to use carcasses ``unfit for human food.''
</P>
<P>
   As Wilson explained, ``it might be possible for an animal to be
found in some particular unsound, and yet fit for food.''
</P>
<P>
   The suggestion caused an uproar.
</P>
<P>
   One perplexed legislator told Wilson, ``if it is unfit for human
food, it should be condemned. If it is unsound and unhealthful, of
course it is unfit for human food. I do not see why you object to
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Judge Samuel Cowan, representing Texas cattle ranchers, tried a
slightly different tack.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now the term 'wholesome' I would take out entirely,'' Cowan
told the committee. ``I would not have that in the bill, because a
thing that is wholesome to you might not be wholesome to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Cowan argued that federal inspectors could hamstring business by
interpreting ``wholesome'' any way they wished.
</P>
<P>
   When the bill was debated on the House floor 13 days later,
legislators paid little heed to the meat packers' objections. Words
such as ``wholesome'' stayed in because outside the industry, one
legislator noted, ``no one objects to them.''
</P>
<P>
   Nearly a century later, Agriculture Department officials still
say they are responsible for making sure that food reaching the
consumer is wholesome. But as recently as last February,
whistle-blowers inside the Agriculture Department said the
government was allowing diseased chickens to be turned into chicken
nuggets at a Gold Kist Inc. poultry plant in Guntersville, Ala.
</P>
<P>
   Following the inspectors' disclosures several school systems
refused to use the chicken nuggets, and a debate ensued on what was
meant by ``wholesome.''
</P>
<P>
   The inspectors at the Gold Kist plants readily acknowledged that
the chicken nuggets would not hurt anyone, arguing instead that
they were not wholesome. To several states such as Ohio, the idea
of ``wholesome'' seemed synonymous with safety because they tested
the product for pathogens. Federal officials would not respond to
repeated requests to explain what they meant by wholesome, but
their press releases emphasized that the Gold Kist products were
safe.
</P>
<P>
   John Bekkers, Gold Kist president and chief operating officer,
said in a statement, ``As we have assured our customers all along,
Gold Kist Farms brand chicken products are safe, wholesome and good
to eat.''
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   To critics, the Gold Kist case shows that the idea of
wholesomeness has become more flexible.
</P>
<P>
   As part of its program to implement its science-based inspection
methods, the Agriculture Department introduced its experimental
inspection program last October at the Gold Kist plant. While the
plant was supposedly chosen because it processed mostly young,
healthy birds, farmers in the area said the flocks they were
sending to the plant had been ravaged by disease for the past
several years.
</P>
<P>
   As one federal official later noted ruefully to investigators,
``When the Guntersville plant receives birds free of disease, the
(experimental inspection program) works very well. When there is a
high incidence of disease, complaints are raised.''
</P>
<P>
   Because they are supposed to prod the company into policing
itself, federal inspectors said they were ordered not to take
diseased chicken off the production line. That was the company's
job, they said. But the inspectors said that if the company didn't
do its job, nothing much happened.
</P>
<P>
   After the inspectors complained to Cox Newspapers in February
about diseased poultry being sold to consumers, plant records show
there was a dramatic change. Just before news leaked out, the
company condemned about 5 percent of its carcasses on any given
day. Afterwards, the number skyrocketed to 33 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the testimony of their own inspectors as well as plant
records, the Agriculture Department maintains that food leaving the
Guntersville plant was and is ``safe and wholesome.''
</P>
<P>
   In press releases and public meetings, department officials went
to great pains to point out that their new science-based inspection
prevents anything harmful to humans from slipping through.
</P>
<P>
   But as Nicols(cq) Fox, who has written extensively on the food
industry, pointed out, ``Unquestioned is whether science is even an
appropriate standard for food. It is certainly not the way most
people decide what to eat and what to avoid. Science might tell us
that a cooked fly in our soup isn't dangerous or that sterilized
manure is a safe protein ingredient in corn flakes, but neither
would be acceptable to most of us.''

   WASHINGTON _ Sean Conley, a deliberate and reserved
seventh-grader from Newark, Calif., correctly spelled nyctalopia,
discomfiture and floppety at the 73rd National Spelling Bee
Wednesday, hurtling him in Thursday's finals.
</P>
<P>
   Sean, 12, who is schooled at home, hopes to top his tie for
ninth place last year. The San Francisco Examiner is sponsoring him
in the bee.
</P>
<P>
   Sean was among 248 contestants in the bee, many of them
fidgeting and twisting in their chairs upon hearing a dreaded bell
that signals mistakes. While dozens of them went to the so-called
``comfort room'' to regain their composure after losing, Sean
calmly tapped his fingers on his thighs as if playing the piano,
awaiting his next turn.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just tapping,'' he said during a break in the contest.
``I'm getting bored. I've seen all these words before. There's no
challenge.''
</P>
<P>
   Each time Sean's turn came up and he faced the word pronouncer
at an imposing black podium beside the red-curtained stage, he
asked for the word's meaning, its origin and its use in a sentence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just ask a lot of questions because it gives me time to
think,'' Sean said. ``I want to make sure I don't say the wrong
letters.'' He added: ``Some kids race right through and sometimes
they accidentally say a wrong letter.''
</P>
<P>
   The first word was a cinch: Nyctalopia, a Greek word that means
unable to see at twilight. Then came discomfiture, which means
frustration or confusion. Sean knocked that one off too.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, he nailed floppety, which means soft and flexible.
</P>
<P>
   During the break, Sean said he was confident because he had
prepared thoroughly. ``I've been studying from lists of words
they've used in the past.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he hopes to have a computer job when he grows up. Sean's
father, Mike Conley, is an Apple Computer software engineer, said
he had one main objective: ``I want him to learn a little poise _ a
little grace under pressure.'' Conley, however, admitted that he
himself was not cool on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I sat there and bit my fingers just waiting for that bell to
ring,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Conley said Sean started reading at 18 months old. At age
two he was spelling, using plastic refrigerator magnet letters.
</P>
<P>
   Bry Conley, his mother, said Sean likes ``puzzles and
competitions and competing and winning.'' She added that she hoped
he would make friends at the competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's one of these absent-minded-professor types.'' She also
noted, however, that her son, whom she teaches at home through the
Tri-City Homeschoolers program, has ``worked really hard for it (a
victory) for so many years.''
</P>
<P>
   The spelling bee, sponsored by E.W. Scripps Co., offers the
winner prizes that include $10,000.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Sean Conley, a deliberate and reserved
seventh-grader from Newark, Calif., correctly spelled nyctalopia,
discomfiture and floppety at the 73rd National Spelling Bee
Wednesday and advanced to Thursday's finals.
</P>
<P>
   Sean, 12, who is schooled at home, hopes to top his tie for
ninth place in last year's bee. His entry is sponsored by The San
Francisco Examiner.
</P>
<P>
   Sean was among 248 contestants in the bee, many of them
fidgeting and twisting in their chairs upon hearing a dreaded bell
that signals mistakes. While dozens of them went to the so-called
``comfort room'' to regain their composure after losing, Sean
calmly tapped his fingers on his thighs as if playing the piano,
awaiting his next turn.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just tapping,'' he said during a break in the contest.
``I'm getting bored. I've seen all these words before. There's no
challenge.''
</P>
<P>
   Each time Sean's turn came up and he faced the word pronouncer
at an imposing black podium beside the red-curtained stage, he
asked for the word's meaning, its origin and its use in a sentence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just ask a lot of questions because it gives me time to
think,'' Sean said. ``I want to make sure I don't say the wrong
letters.'' He added: ``Some kids race right through and sometimes
they accidentally say a wrong letter.''
</P>
<P>
   The first word was a cinch: Nyctalopia, a Greek word that means
unable to see at twilight. Then came discomfiture, which means
frustration or confusion. Sean knocked that one off too.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, he nailed floppety, which means soft and flexible.
</P>
<P>
   During the break, Sean said he was confident because he had
prepared thoroughly. ``I've been studying from lists of words
they've used in the past.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he hopes to have a computer job when he grows up. Sean's
father, Mike Conley, who is an Apple Computer software engineer,
said he had one main objective: ``I want him to learn a little
poise _ a little grace under pressure.'' Conley, however, admitted
that he himself was not cool on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I sat there and bit my fingers just waiting for that bell to
ring,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Conley said Sean started reading at 18 months old. At age
two he was spelling, using plastic refrigerator magnet letters.
</P>
<P>
   Bry Conley, his mother, said Sean likes ``puzzles and
competitions and competing and winning.'' She added that she hoped
he would make friends at the competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's one of these absent-minded-professor types.'' She also
noted, however, that her son, whom she teaches at home through the
Tri-City Homeschoolers program, has ``worked really hard for it (a
victory) for so many years.''
</P>
<P>
   The spelling bee, sponsored by E.W. Scripps Co., offers the
winner prizes that include $10,000.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Let's start off with our own rumor killer and this comes
straight the horse's mouth. ``I was reading on the Internet, 'Dusty
leaves ECW, returns to WCW,' usty Rhodes said. ``What happened is
that Turner South came to me _ Turner South _ and they wanted me to
host a WCW Classic show. And I said, `cool.' And the show is going
to be hot, and they'll probably show it ten times a day, so I'll
become the new Andy Griffith,'' Rhodes said. ``But I'm still with
(ECW executive producer) Paulie (Heyman). (After being fired at
WCW) Paulie called and said, 'Dream are you OK, you need anything?
.. . You're never too old for me. Why don't you come up here, no
contract, I'll give you this much money, just come up here, right
now, as long as I'm here.''
</P>
<P>
   That made me feel good. I went, respected the guy's show and I
remembered how much I had missed it. If he calls me, I'll be
wherever he needs me. And if you don't see me for three or four
months, you'll see me because out of sight out of mind.''
</P>
<P>
   Bet you didn't know, Dusty Rhodes was the youth football coach
of the year in the Atlanta area for 1999. Rhodes coached his son
Cody's eighth-grade team to the conference championship. ``It was
the highlight of my career, even with all the places I've been,
it's my biggest thrill,'' Rhodes said.
</P>
<P>
   Do you think this is the end for Ric Flair? He has a career
match at the June 11th ''Great American Bash'' against his son
David, but as we have seen at previous pay-per-views, losing a
match that forces you into retirement doesn't mean you have to stay
retired. Right Kevin Nash?

 Secrets of Success: Delfina Marries Pasta and Rabe   By Michael Bauer  
 c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle  
   
 SAN FRANCISCO _  Craig Stoll shows how easy it is to create
magnificent pasta with little effort and few ingredients.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Stoll, who owns the popular Delfina restaurant in the Mission,
uses orecchiette, the disk-shaped pasta that retains a chewy
texture, in a dish that is fast enough for a weeknight dinner, but
complex enough for a dinner party.
</P>
<P>
   The sauce is made from parsley, chile flakes, garlic and anchovy
fillets, which add a subtle depth of flavor to the blend. For
interest, broccoli rabe and potato cubes are cooked in boiling
water and set aside. Then the pasta is added and cooked part-way
through.
</P>
<P>
   Stoll uses a clever technique that intensifies the flavor of the
dish. He places the pasta, along with some of the water, in a large
saute pan with the seasonings, where it finishes cooking. In the
process, the oil and other ingredients emulsify with the water to
form a silken sauce that just coats the pasta. It's a technique
Stoll also uses with other pastas.
</P>
<P>
   Much of Stoll's cooking is inspired by his stint in Italy. He
worked at many large restaurants in the Bay Area, but was
dissatisfied with what he could produce, and opened Delfina so he
could serve the rustic food he loves to cook.
</P>
<P>
   The interior of the small restaurant has a casual, industrial
feel, with tables lining each wall leading back to a bar and an
open kitchen. There's also a patio in the rear, making it one of
the best places for people who want to enjoy great food outdoors.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Delfina, 3621 18th St. (between Dolores and Guerrero), San &LR; 
 &LR; Francisco; (415) 552-4055. Dinner nightly. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
SECRETS OF SUCCESS:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _ The anchovy fillets. &LR;  Those who dislike anchovies will be
tempted to leave them out, but that would be a mistake. You won't
be able to taste them in the finished sauce, yet they add a complex
background note that would otherwise be missing.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _ Finishing the pasta in the sauce. &LR;  Boiling the partly cooked
orecchiette with the seasonings and pasta water infuses the pasta
with flavor and creates a silken sauce.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
ORECCHIETTE WITH BROCCOLI RABE AND POTATOES
</P>
<P>
   Ingredients:
</P>
<P>
   4 tablespoons olive oil
</P>
<P>
   3/4 cup fresh white bread crumbs
</P>
<P>
   3/4 to 1 pound broccoli rabe (also called broccolini)
</P>
<P>
   2 garlic cloves, minced
</P>
<P>
   2 canned anchovy fillets, drained and mashed to a paste
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons minced fresh Italian parsley
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon drained capers, chopped
</P>
<P>
   1/4 teaspoon dried red chile flakes
</P>
<P>
   1 russet potato, peeled and cut into 1/2-inch dice
</P>
<P>
   12 ounces orecchiette pasta
</P>
<P>
   Salt and pepper to taste
</P>
<P>
   Grated Pecorino Romano cheese
</P>
<P>
   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   Heat 1 tablespoon of the oil in a medium saute pan over medium
heat. Add the bread crumbs and stir until golden brown, about 5
minutes. Remove from the heat.
</P>
<P>
   Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.
</P>
<P>
   Finely chop the broccoli rabe by pressing the heads against a
cutting board to compress the leaves. Starting from the flowering
end, cut off 1/4-inch pieces. Continue cutting the head, discarding
the last inch or so of stem.
</P>
<P>
   Heat the remaining 3 tablespoons of oil in a saute pan large
enough to hold the pasta over medium heat. Add the garlic,
anchovies, 11/2 tablespoons of parsley, capers and chile flakes.
Cook until the ingredients are incorporated but before the garlic
browns, about 3 to 5 minutes. Remove from the heat.
</P>
<P>
   Place the broccoli rabe in a colander that fits inside the pot
of boiling water. Submerge it in the boiling water for 1 minute.
Remove the colander from the water and drain the broccoli rabe.
Cool. Cook the potatoes the same way, until just tender, about 7 to
10 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Add the pasta to the water and cook 7 minutes (the pasta will
not be cooked through). Drain, reserving 4 cups of the cooking
liquid.
</P>
<P>
   Add the broccoli rabe and potato to the garlic mixture and set
the pan over high heat. Stir until the broccoli rabe is coated.
Season to taste with salt and pepper.
</P>
<P>
   Add the pasta and 2 cups of the reserved cooking liquid to the
broccoli rabe. Bring to a boil. Stir constantly until the pasta is
cooked through and the liquid reduces and emulsifies with the oil
to form a thin sauce that covers the pasta, about 5 minutes, adding
more cooking liquid if the mixture becomes dry. Adjust the
seasoning as needed. When finished there should only be a bit of
sauce at the bottom of the pan.
</P>
<P>
   Transfer the pasta to large shallow bowls. Top with the toasted
bread crumbs, the remaining 1/2 tablespoon of parsley, and the
grated cheese.
</P>
<P>
   Serves 4.

 Romancing the Chicken: Just when you thought your affair
with  America's most popular bird was over, 10 chefs show you how
to 
 rekindle the flame   By Tilde Herrera  
 c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle  
   
 SAN FRANCISCO _  Chicken and I have been on the rocks for years.
<TEXT>
<P>
   I used to be a devout chicken-lover, always eager to include it
in casual and special meals. I found it so satisfying that it edged
beef, fish and other proteins from my diet and I ate it nearly
every day.
</P>
<P>
   But awhile back, I realized my romance was faltering. I became
disillusioned with chicken. It was too accessible, too mainstream.
My interest started to wane.
</P>
<P>
   Before long, carne asada replaced grilled chicken tacos. Ahi
tuna salad became too tempting to pass up. And then, the ultimate
betrayal _ I opted for seared ostrich loin instead of roasted free
range chicken.
</P>
<P>
   The honeymoon was over, the excitement long gone. Chicken had
become boring.
</P>
<P>
   I tried to salvage my relationship by asking some of the Bay
Area's top chefs what they do to keep chicken interesting. Johnny
Alamilla, chicken enthusiast and executive chef of San Francisco's
Ch &LR; e &LR; , uses spices and marinades to perk up his chicken dishes. He
loves the way the neutral meat reacts to countless flavors.
</P>
<P>
   Ben de Vries, of Ristorante Ecco in San Francisco, caramelizes
the skin by searing it to add a new dimension to the sweet flesh.
He also adds simple accompaniments, like fresh herbs and flavored
oils, to let the chicken's simple flavor shine through. De Vries
emphasizes that using good quality chicken is essential to a
satisfying meal.
</P>
<P>
   To help reignite my &LR;   &LR; affair with chicken, Alamilla and de Vries
came up with unique, easy chicken recipes I could cook at home,
using ingredients and techniques reflective of their specialities.
A host of other top notch chefs did the same.
</P>
<P>
   They'll work for you, too, if you've tired of chicken for
dinner, day in and day out. Most of these recipes can be made in a
short time. Some need to marinate overnight, but the actual cooking
is a breeze.
</P>
<P>
   These tips from the experts are just what I needed. If your
romance with chicken has been at a low lately, give these recipes a
try. They just may help you turn your ho-hum date with America's
most overused bird into an affair to remember.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; Handling Chicken &QL;  &LR; 
Chicken, like any raw meat, can harbor salmonella and other
potential disease-causing organisms, so storing and handling it
properly are essential to reducing the risk of contracting any
illness.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _ Refrigerate.  &LR; After purchase, refrigerate chicken on the
bottom shelf (generally the coldest part) of the refrigerator for
up to two days. Keep chicken refrigerated until ready to use. Store
chicken wrapped in loose wax paper or in loose plastic wrap. Place
it on a plate or dish to prevent the juices from dripping onto
other foods and surfaces.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _ Freeze.  &LR; In the freezer, chicken should be kept in a tightly
sealed container or heavy duty freezer bag for up to six months.
Its quality will be best if it's used within two months.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _ Defrost.  &LR; Defrost chicken on the bottom shelf of the
refrigerator. It is important that the chicken is defrosted evenly;
otherwise, parts of the flesh that are still frozen before cooking
may not reach the temperature required to kill salmonella bacteria.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _ Cook.  &LR; The U.S. Food and Drug Administration recommends that
chicken be cooked to minimum internal temperature of 165 to kill
salmonella and other bacteria. For a whole chicken, insert a meat
thermometer into the thickest part of the inner thigh area near the
breast without touching the bone. For a single breast, insert the
thermometer into the thickest part.
</P>
<P>
   After cooking, let the chicken rest about five minutes for
single breasts and 10 minutes for whole birds to let the juices
redistribute before carving.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _ Clean up.  &LR; Wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water
before and after handling raw chicken. Always use a separate
cutting board for chicken if preparing other meats or vegetables
simultaneously to avoid cross-contamination. Wash utensils and
cutting board in hot, soapy water and sanitize immediately.
</P>
<P>
   It's a good idea to keep a sanitizer on hand to spray on
counters, utensils and cutting boards after use. Simply fill a
spray bottle with water and add a splash of bleach (about 1/2
tablespoon to 1 quart of water). Shake to combine. Be sure to label
the bottle and keep it out of reach of children.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; Facts About Chicken &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Americans remain smitten with chicken, according to the National
Chicken Council and the U.S. Poultry and Egg Association. On May 1,
the two trade organizations released results from their latest
survey that shows nine out of 10 households consume chicken at
least once a week, while three out of 10 households consume chicken
three or more times per week. About 11 percent of those surveyed
declared they expected to eat even more chicken in the next year.
</P>
<P>
   According to Bill Mattos, president of the California Poultry
Industry Federation, Americans consume more chicken than any other
meat _ 81 pounds per person annually. That's five pounds more per
capita than last year. Meat and pork lag behind at 69 pounds and 52
pounds, respectively.

 &LR; CHE'S HAVANA-STYLE CHICKEN
</P>
<P>
   An airline chicken breast has the first half of the trimmed wing
bone still attached. Even if a boneless chicken breast is used,
make sure that the skin is still intact. Also, make sure the
plantains are ripe for this recipe, otherwise they will not absorb
enough flavor from the marinade. Chef Johnny Alamilla recommends
serving this dish with fresh or sauteed greens, such as spinach or
chard.
</P>
<P>
   Ingredients:
</P>
<P>
   The Marinade
</P>
<P>
   2 cups freshly squeezed orange juice (about 4 oranges)
</P>
<P>
   2 cups freshly squeezed lime juice (about 9 limes)
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon chopped fresh oregano
</P>
<P>
   1/3 cup chopped fresh Italian parsley
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoon chopped garlic
</P>
<P>
   2 Fresno chiles, seeded and chopped
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons ground coriander seeds
</P>
<P>
   The Chicken and Plantains
</P>
<P>
   6 chicken breasts, wing bone attached (``airline breast'')
</P>
<P>
   Salt and pepper to taste
</P>
<P>
   Olive oil as needed
</P>
<P>
   Juice of 1/2 lime
</P>
<P>
   3 ripe plantains, peeled and sliced lengthwise, then cut in half
</P>
<P>
   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   Combine all marinade ingredients and let stand for 30 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Rinse each chicken breast and pat dry, then add to the marinade.
Chicken may marinate overnight (in the refrigerator) for a bold,
citrus flavor, or for 1 hour at room temperature (if marinating for
only an hour, give the chicken a squeeze of lime before serving for
extra zing).
</P>
<P>
   Preheat oven to 375 degrees. Remove the chicken from the
marinade and pat dry. Season with salt and pepper. Add enough olive
oil to a heavy cast-iron skillet to coat the bottom. Place over
medium heat. When hot, add the chicken skin-side down and saute
until browned. Flip the chicken breasts and place the entire
skillet in the oven. Roast for 7 to 8 minutes, or until the chicken
is three-quarters cooked (timing will depend on size of chicken
breasts).
</P>
<P>
   Remove the skillet from the oven and transfer the chicken to a
plate.
</P>
<P>
   Add the lime juice to the skillet. Add the plantains and toss
them in the pan drippings until coated. Return the skillet to the
oven, and bake for 5 to 8 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Return the chicken breasts to skillet and roast for 10 minutes
longer.

JOJO'S PROVENCAL CHICKEN
</P>
<P>
   This earthy, Provencal-inspired dish, by Jojo's Curt Clingman,
requires a minimum of preparation and tastes fabulous. Clingman
specifies using quality olives like Picholine or Lucques. They
should not be pitted, Clingman says, because the pits add a
wonderful nutty quality to the dish. Be sure to warn your guests
before they start to eat. Serve with rice, lightly oiled pasta or a
loaf of country-style French bread.
</P>
<P>
   Ingredients:
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup all-purpose flour
</P>

   1 tablespoon chopped Italian parsley
</P>
<P>
   Instructions:

   Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   Mix together the flour, salt and pepper. Dredge the chicken
pieces in the flour mixture, shaking off excess.
</P>
<P>
   Heat the olive oil in an oven-safe skillet. Add the chicken and
fry until lightly browned, turning once. Remove the chicken from
the skillet and set aside. Add the onions cut-side down to the
skillet and saute until lightly browned; remove and set aside.
Drain the grease from the skillet. Add the wine and cook over high
heat until reduced by half. Tie the thyme and savory together with
kitchen string. Add the chicken broth and the thyme and savory.
Season with salt and pepper. Bring to a boil, return the chicken
and onions to the skillet, add the carrots and simmer for 5
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Loosely cover the skillet with a piece of parchment paper or
foil and place in the oven. Bake for 45 minutes. Check after first
15 minutes to be sure the liquid is simmering slowly.
</P>
<P>
   When the chicken is done, remove the pan from the oven. Give the
herb bundle a shake to free the leaves into the sauce. Discard the
stems. Skim the fat from the sauce. Add the orange peel and olives,
cover and let steep for 20 minutes. Stir in the mustard and bring
everything back to a simmer. Adjust seasoning. Garnish with
parsley.
</P>
<P>
   Serve with rice or pasta.

   11/2 teaspoons salt
</P>
<P>
   11/2 teaspoons pepper
</P>
<P>
   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   Combine the herbs and olive oil in a small bowl. Place the
chicken in a shallow pan and pour the olive oil mixture over it.
Turn the chicken in the marinade, rubbing it into all the nooks and
crannies, until the chicken is completely coated. Cover and
refrigerate for at least 2 hours; overnight is even better.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; To prepare the potatoes and mushrooms:  &LR; Preheat oven to 350
degrees. Heat the olive oil in a 12-inch roasting pan or a 14-inch
Dutch oven over medium heat. Add the potatoes and onions and saute
until lightly browned. Add the mushrooms and thyme and cook for an
additional 5 minutes. Drizzle with 2 ounces porcini oil, sprinkle
with the salt and pepper, and place in the oven. Roast until the
potatoes are cooked through, about 25 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Cooking the chicken:  &LR; While the vegetables are roasting, place
two 14-inch cast-iron skillets over high heat. When the pans are
very hot, add enough olive oil to one pan to coat the bottom.
</P>
<P>
   Place the chicken breast-side down in the hot oil (careful, it
will splatter). Place the second skillet on top of the chicken and,
using oven mitts, press down firmly. If the top skillet does not
seem heavy enough, weight it down with a brick.
</P>
<P>
   Reduce the heat to medium. Fry the chicken, turning it every 5
minutes and replacing the top skillet each time, for about 25
minutes, or until done. Remove chicken from skillet and let rest
for 5 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; To Serve:  &LR; Cut each chicken half into 2 pieces, dividing
between the breast and thigh/leg.
</P>
<P>
   Portion the vegetables onto warmed serving plates. Top each
portion with a chicken quarter. Drizzle each with an equal amount
of the remaining 2 ounces porcini oil.
</P>
<P>
   Serves 4.

 &LR; ROASTED CHICKEN WITH ASPARAGUS, FENNEL &AMP; POTATOES
</P>
<P>
   This homey, hearty dish is the type of casual meal that
Elisabeth Daniel's Daniel Patterson prefers to make on one of his
rare days off. Quality ingredients should be used because of the
recipe's straightforward nature. All of the ingredients, except the
aged sherry vinegar, usually can be found at the San Francisco
Ferry Plaza Farmers' Market (Saturday mornings). Patterson
specifically recommends using chicken from Hoffman Gamebirds,
organically grown vegetables and olive oil from Davero or Nick
Sciabica &AMP; Sons.
</P>
<P>
   Ingredients:
</P>
<P>
   1 chicken, 4 to 5 pounds
</P>
<P>
   Salt and pepper to taste
</P>
<P>
   1 pound small Yukon Gold potatoes (creamer size)
</P>
<P>
   2 fennel bulbs
</P>
<P>
   5 tablespoons green (also called Fall harvest) olive oil
</P>
<P>
   1 pound asparagus
</P>
<P>
   1 cup low-sodium chicken broth
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon aged sherry vinegar
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons minced chives
</P>
<P>
   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   Preheat oven to 400 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; The chicken:  &LR; Season the chicken generously, inside and out,
with salt and pepper. Place the chicken breast-up in a roasting
pan. Roast for about 1 hour, or until done. Transfer the chicken to
a platter and let rest for 10 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; The vegetables: &LR;  Place the potatoes in a saucepan. Fill with
water to cover by 1 inch; add a generous amount of salt. Bring to a
gentle boil, then simmer for 5 to 10 minutes, or until a sharp
knife can easily pierce the potatoes. Drain. When cool enough to
handle, peel the potatoes and cut into quarters. Set aside.
</P>
<P>
   Quarter the fennel bulbs lengthwise. Cut out the core, then cut
the fennel into 3/8-inch strips.
</P>
<P>
   Heat 1 tablespoon of the olive oil in a large skillet over low
heat. Add the fennel and gently saute until tender, about 30
minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Remove from heat and set
aside.
</P>
<P>
   Trim the tough ends from the asparagus and cut the spears into
2-inch lengths.
</P>
<P>
   Toss the asparagus with 2 tablespoons of the olive oil and a
little salt in a oven-proof saute pan. Place pan in the oven and
roast until the asparagus is tender, about 10 to 15 minutes,
tossing every few minutes. Remove from oven and set aside.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; After chicken is done:  &LR; Combine the asparagus and potatoes in
the skillet with the fennel. Keep warm.
</P>
<P>
   Pour off the fat from the roasting pan, reserving a few
tablespoons. Add this reserved fat to the vegetables.
</P>
<P>
   Add the chicken broth to the pan and bring to a boil, scraping
up the browned bits from bottom of the pan. Boil until the liquid
has reduced by one quarter. Strain the liquid into a bowl. Add the
sherry vinegar and remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil. Add any
accumulated juices from the chicken. Season with salt and pepper.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; To serve: &LR;  Mound the vegetables in the center of a serving dish
and pour the sauce over them. Place the chicken on top and garnish
with chives.
</P>
<P>
   Serves 4.

CHARD
</P>
<P>
   This is another excellent grilling option from Ondine's Seiji
Wakabayashi. The roasted garlic and miso nuances are accented by
the tanginess of the Asian-inspired chard. The chicken also would
be terrific incorporated into a Chinese chicken salad.
</P>
<P>
   Ingredients:
</P>
<P>
   The Chicken
</P>
<P>
   2 heads of garlic
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   4 garlic cloves, minced
</P>

</P>
<P>
   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; The Marinade: &LR;  Preheat oven to 450 degrees. Slice the top off
of the garlic heads, keeping the cloves intact. Remove the outer,
papery skins. Brush the heads of garlic with olive oil and wrap in
aluminum foil. Place in the oven and roast for 45 minutes to 1
hour, or until the cloves are completely softened.
</P>
<P>
   Squeeze the roasted garlic cloves from their skins and place in
a blender. Add the red and white miso, hot chile oil, chicken broth
and salt. Blend until smooth.
</P>
<P>
   Pour the marinade into a bowl; add the chicken breasts and turn
to coat. Cover and refrigerate for from 8 to 12 hours.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; The Chicken:  &LR; Preheat oven to 325 degrees. Place the chicken in

   &UR; The Chard:  &LR; Combine the sesame seeds, soy sauce and sugar in a
blender and puree. Set aside.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Portion the chard onto warmed serving plates, then place a
chicken breast alongside.

 Mushroom Magic Awaits Those Who Dare to Hunt   By Kim Severson  
 c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle  
   
 SAN FRANCISCO _  Wild king boletes and rumple-headed morels can
sell for $45 a pound or more in Bay Area markets _ a prospect that
makes gathering your own an attractive alternative.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Finding your own fungus in the woods is particularly sweet in
the spring, when mythic morels appear for just a handful of weeks
and the first bold, chunky king boletes (call them porcini or
cepes) are just starting their march through the forest.
</P>
<P>
   To the uninitiated, how and where to search _ and even what to
hunt for _ remains as much a mystery as the morels themselves. But
for those dedicated enough to camp out in the woods and tromp
through old burns and slag in search of springtime mushrooms, an
organized foray is the way to go.
</P>
<P>
   The Sonoma-based Wild About Mushrooms Sierra offers a series of
camps throughout the year that teach novices how find and cook wild
mushrooms. Longtime fungus freak Charmoon Richardson runs the two-
and three-day events, which cost around $100 depending on the trip,
and often serves as head chef when a visiting kitchen professional
isn't along.
</P>
<P>
   Charmoon, along with David Campbell, one of the Bay Area's
leading experts on identifying edible mushrooms, usually scour the
mountains a week or two before their forays to make sure campers
will find enough. They arrange a group campsite and alternative
lodging for people who don't want to stay in a tent.
</P>
<P>
   The first priority on a foray is to pick enough mushrooms to
feed the camp. Large morels, which take well to smoke, might get
stuffed with sheep's milk cheese, rolled in butter and grilled.
King boletes are sliced, dipped in a winey marinade and cooked on
the grill until crisp. A main course will feature morels paired
with smoked salmon and sour cream in a sort of stroganoff.
</P>
<P>
   The next morning, more mushrooms might be scrambled into eggs
over the propane stoves set up at camp.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever's left is divided among the group, allowing campers to
go home with enough bounty to cook with at home.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  The next Wild About Mushrooms camp is June 9-11 ($90). &LR;   &LR; Other
classes, food events and mushroom walks are also offered &LR; 
 &LR; throughout the year. Call (707) 887-1888 for more information, &LR; 
 &LR; or log on to  &LR; www.wildmushrooms.qpg.com &LR; . &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  The Mycological Society of San Francisco also holds &LR; 
 &LR; mushroom-related events throughout the year. Call (415) &LR;   &LR; 759-0495
or log on to the online calendar at  &LR; www.mssf.org &LR; . &LR;

<P>
   DRUG-PRICES (Washington) _ More and more in recent years,
private insurance has been picking up the cost of prescription
medicine. Only about one-quarter of the total drug costs of
Americans are now paid out of pocket. That explains why there is no
general political uproar, even though drug prices in the United
States have been rising by as much as 15 percent a year, the
pharmaceutical manufacturers are among the most profitable
businesses in the world and many new drugs in Canada and Europe
cost a fraction of what they do here. Imagine the political swivet
Americans would be in if that were the case with gasoline or some
other staple of daily life. The elderly, of course, are up in arms.
Those who are completely dependent on Medicare, which does not
cover the cost of outpatient prescriptions, bear the brunt of the
skyrocketing prices. But most Americans never face these high drug
prices. They pay no more than $5 or $10 for each prescription. By
David E. Rosenbaum. (1400 words)

taking aim at psoriasis, a chronic disease that affects seven
million Americans, and about 30 companies have psoriasis drugs in
clinical trials. While none of the drugs are expected to cure the
disease permanently, early test results show that some could be
safer and effective for longer periods than existing drugs. But
some analysts caution that psoriasis is deceptively hard to treat
and that one company after another has failed in its treatment
efforts. Another drawback is that since psoriasis is not considered
to be a very serious disease, the Food and Drug Administration
might set tougher standards for drug approval. By Andrew Pollack.

 Wine Potpourri: Champagne Deserves More than `Special Occasion' 
 Status  By Gerald D. Boyd  
 c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; SAN FRANCISCO _  &LR; Champagne has always been associated with the
finer things in life, a connection that has been both a blessing
and a bane to Champagne producers. Although Champagne is celebrated
around the world, many Champagne houses have looked to the United
States as one of their major export markets.
<P>
   Given the adult population of the United States, the potential
here for huge sales is great, even though Americans consider
Champagne and other quality sparkling wines as special occasion
drinks.
</P>
<P>
   Prince Alain de Polignac, of Champagne Pommery, would like
Americans to think of Pommery Champagne as an art. He says that
from 1858, when the young widow Louise Pommery decided to take over
her husband's business, Pommery has strived to create a luxury
product with a unique style. In 1860, Madame Pommery established a
direct marketing campaign, including the appointment of an export
manager, a position previously unknown in Champagne.
</P>
<P>
   Prince de Polignac has continued the tradition, maintaining that
the art of Pommery lies in its ``uniqueness of flavor, light and
brightness, which sparkles like the light.'' Perhaps a bit over the
top, but Prince de Polignac believes that all Champagne, and
especially Pommery, reflects ``the art of wine making and the art
of living.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, Pommery produces a line of Champagnes in one of the most
visually stunning properties in Reims, Champagne. The
Elizabethan-style architectural complex, built in 1866, is
surrounded by 61 acres of vineyards and stands rests on top of an
11-mile network of chalk aging cellars, dating from the Roman
Empire. But the heart of Pommery lies in the vineyards, 741 acres
of the highest rated vineyards, planted in seven ``grand cru''
villages.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything starts with Brut Royal,'' says Prince de Polignac.
``Brut Royal, a blend of one-third each Chardonnay, Pinot Noir and
Pinot Meunier, is the heart of the Pommery style'' Pommery Brut
Royal ($35) is fresh and lively with lifted fruit, a touch of
toasted nuts, and a long balanced finish.
</P>
<P>
   For more depth and complexity, there's Pommery Brut Royal
Apanage ($40), a cuvee that leans heavily on Chardonnay. The
bouquet is fresh, fruity and lively and the full-bodied flavors are
richly textured. This blend of wines from 12 crus is distinct and
bold.
</P>
<P>
   Pommery Brut Rose ($40), a delightful blend of Pinot Noir, Pinot
Meunier and Chardonnay, is a tasty wine with good structure, layers
of sweet fruit, crisp acidity and a long luscious finish.
</P>
<P>
   Moving up the scale in complexity and depth is Pommery Brut
1992, $60, with its fresh fruit flavors, creamy texture, crisp
acidity and just a touch of warm bread yeast in the finish. Vintage
Champagne often shows a little oxidation, but Prince de Polignac
says that oxidation is not the Pommery style.
</P>
<P>
   Pommery's crowning achievement is the 1990 Louise, $100, a rich
and creamy Champagne with focused fruit flavors, excellent acidity,
great finesse and charm. Louise first appeared on the market in
1986 and quickly took its place among the best of Champagnes grand
marques.

<P>
   &UR; Heidsieck Mis en Cave &LR;
</P>
<P>
   An American beer company gives the consumer freshness
information by putting a ``born on'' date on every can of its beer,
and now Champagne Charles Heidsieck has adapted the same concept to
its non-vintage Champagne.
</P>
<P>
   Heidsieck's winemaker, Daniel Thibault, calls the innovative
concept, ``Mis en Cave,'' which means ``laid down in the cellar.''
The year on the bottle refers to when the Champagne began its aging
in the cellar, not the vintage year.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, Charles Heidsieck Mis En Cave 1996 ($45) began its aging
in 1996. The wine aged on the yeast lees for three years and was
disgorged in 1999, a longer time on the lees than many non-vintage
Champagnes. Heidsieck also has Mis en Cave 1995 ($47) and Mis en
Cave 1993 ($50).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Learning to Love &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Winemakers trying to crack the huge market for wine in China are
either amused or horrified by what they often see there in
restaurants. Wine is not a traditional part of Chinese culture, so
the Chinese treat wine like any other beverage.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of the quality or value of the wine, many Chinese mix
white wine with Coca Cola and red wine with Sprite.
</P>
<P>
   On one of my recent trips to Australia, a winemaker friend told
me about his efforts to place his wines in Beijing, Shanghai and
Canton.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was in Canton participating in a big wine tasting at a
hotel,'' he said. ``The night of the tasting, I walked into the
room and found the Chinese pouring my reserve Shiraz into a large
glass and filling it with Sprite. I went outside to calm down, then
realized that if that's the way we're going to get into the bloody
market, so be it.''

 Learning To Cook: Make Brunch Special With James Beard's French 
 Toast  By Marion Cunningham  
 c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; SAN FRANCISCO _  &LR; Somehow my vote for the most satisfying of all
meals is the late Saturday or Sunday breakfast often called
``brunch.'' Companionable, indulgent and lazy, it turns the clock
back to when life was slower and simpler.
<P>
   In case you thought, like I did, that the word ``brunch'' was
coined in the U.S. late 1940s, it turns out that brunch was a term
in England in the 1900s.
</P>
<P>
   James Beard, one of the outstanding American cooks and cookbook
authors of the 20th century _ he wrote 28 cookbooks _ introduced me
to his favorite brunch recipe, J.B.'s French Toast. He told me that
they used to serve this in the dining cars on the Santa Fe
Railroad. The crumbled cornflakes give every bite a crisp crunch
that is mighty good.
</P>
<P>
   This will make a memorable meal with the addition of a lightly
sugared bowl of strawberries during the spring and summer. During
the winter, serve it with grapefruit halves.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &LR; J.B.'S FRENCH TOAST
</P>
<P>
   Ingredients:
</P>
<P>
   3 eggs
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup milk
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon nutmeg
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   2 cups cornflakes
</P>
<P>
   4 tablespoons (1/2 stick) butter
</P>
<P>
   6 slices thick white bread (1/2- to 3/4-inch thick)
</P>
<P>
   6 tablespoons sugar
</P>
<P>
   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR;   &UR; Prepare the batter:  &LR; Crack the eggs into a bowl. Add the
milk, nutmeg and salt and stir briskly so the mixture is blended
well and all one color. Using a shallow bowl makes it easy to dip
and coat the bread slices.
</P>
<P>
   Crumble the cornflakes slightly (to make each flake about half
of its original size) and spread them in a layer on a piece of wax
paper.
</P>
<P>
   Preheat the oven to 225 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Prepare the Bread:  &LR; Dip (don't soak) both sides of each slice
of bread into the batter. Press each slice of bread on both sides
into the cornflakes to coat the bread well.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Fry the French toast:  &LR; Melt 2 tablespoons of the butter in a
12-inch skillet over medium heat. Add 3 slices of the bread and fry
until golden on each side. When done, sprinkle about 1 tablespoon
of sugar on top of each slice and keep the toast warm in the oven.
</P>
<P>
   Fry the remaining 3 slices in the remaining 2 tablespoons of
butter. Serve hot.

 Best Way: Preparing Hamburgers   By Andy Lax 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; SAN FRANCISCO _  &LR; As millions of people roll their dusty Webers from
garages, we decided to test the ultimate of all barbecue delicacies
_ the all-American hamburger.
<P>
   Stripped of its bun and condiments, a great burger must be able
to stand alone. After a battery of tests, we found the best method
for preparing burgers that will make your neighbors envious of the
aromas drifting over the backyard fence.
</P>
<P>
   All the tests used 1/3-pound of hamburger seasoned with 1/4
teaspoon each of salt and black pepper. All were cooked to medium.
</P>
<P>
   We tested for fat content first. We compared 73 percent lean, 80
percent lean, 90 percent lean and 93 percent lean. Both the 90
percent and 93 percent were dry. Though some liked the meaty taste
of the leaner burgers, the ones with more fat were juicier.
However, the 73 percent lean meat, though suggested by many
butchers, was too mealy for some tastes. The 80 percent lean struck
the best balance between the requisite fat and a good, meaty
texture.
</P>
<P>
   Next, we determined the best way to season hamburger patties. We
seasoned three identical patties with 1/4 teaspoon each of salt and
pepper. We mixed the seasonings into one patty, sprinkled them on
both the top and bottom of the next, and both mixed them into and
sprinkled them on the third. Surprisingly, the panel prefered the
burger with the seasonings sprinkled on it. Though some bites were
saltier than others, the surface seasonings made a nice crust when
seared in the pan.
</P>
<P>
   The winner of the seasoning test went on to round three _
hamburger patty formation. The first burger was packed together
into a dense disc. The other was formed into a patty with minimal
handling. Though the tightly packed burger was more aesthetically
pleasing, the result was mealy, dense and lacked bite. The loosely
packed burger stayed firm and meaty and was the hands-down winner.
</P>
<P>
   Next, we tested cooking methods using a nonstick pan, a
cast-iron pan, a grill pan and a charcoal grill. The cast-iron pan
gave off a somewhat unpleasant metallic taste and was the least
favorite among the tasters. While the nonstick pan performed well,
it was neither a match for the grill pan nor the grill. The grill
produced a moist burger that was meaty, juicy and had a good smoke
flavor.
</P>
<P>
   However, the grill pan was the biggest surprise. This burger
also had a good smoke flavor and grill marks for visual appeal.
While there is no replacement for the grill in the hearts of most
Americans, the grill pan offers a fine alternative for those of us
driven indoors by San Francisco's chilly nights.
</P>
<P>
   Not content to let our winning burger rest on its meaty laurels,
we pitted it against the ultimate of all San Francisco hamburgers _
the Zuni Cafe burger. The secret of chef/owner Judy Rodger's
success is salting large strips of chuck overnight and then
grinding it. The only change we made to Zuni's recipe was to use a
food processor to grind the meat, pulsing it in chunks to the
desired consistency. The Zuni burger was voted superior by
unanimous decision. While it did not have the salty crust, the meat
was far juicier and of superior quality.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE BEST WAY &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Use 21/2 pounds of good quality chuck, cut the meat into long
strips. Sprinkle with 11/2 teaspoons of fine sea salt, cover and
refrigerate overnight. Using a meat grinder or a food processor,
grind meat to desired consistency. Handling the meat as little as
possible, form into patties of desired size. Using either a grill
or a grill pan over medium high heat, cook the burger to desired
doneness, about 3-4 minutes per side for a medium burger.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; AN APPEALING ALTERNATIVE &LR;
</P>
<P>
   If grinding your own meat doesn't appeal to you, the following
method produces a fine burger. Handling the meat as little as
possible, form 80 percent lean ground beef into patties. Sprinkle
both the top and bottom with salt and pepper to taste. Using either
a grill or a grill pan on medium-high heat, cook the burger to
desired doneness.

 Taster's Choice: Two Ricotta Brands Stand Above the Rest   By Robin Davis  
 c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle  
   
 SAN FRANCISCO _  Whole milk ricotta cheese is wonderful in so many
recipes like lasagne, or on its own served with fruit or crackers.
Italians have been making it for years, but now many American
cheesemakers have gotten into the act.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Today's panel tasted five whole milk ricotta cheeses, many made
in California. They ranged in price from $2.89 for 15 ounces to
$9.95 per pound. The panel found distinct differences between them,
with two coming out far ahead of the others.
</P>
<P>
   First place went to  &UR; Mozzarella Fresca &LR;  (15 ounces, $3.99 at
Whole Foods). Panelists described the flavor as wholesome, clean
and sweet; one thought it would work particularly well in recipes
calling for whole milk ricotta and another thought the cheese had a
pleasant nuttiness. Two panelists called the texture a bit grainy.
Four would buy it; one might.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Bellwether Farms &LR;  ($9.95 per pound at Draeger's) came in
second, although three panelists picked it as their favorite. Two
tasters particularly liked the creaminess. Others noted the nutty,
clean fresh milk flavor. Four would buy it; one would not.
</P>
<P>
   Third place went to  &UR; Polly-O &LR;  (15 ounces, $2.89-$3.99 at many
supermarkets). Three panelists thought the texture was too thin and
watery, although most liked the sweet flavor. One would buy it, one
might buy it and three would not.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Lioni Latticini &LR;  ($4.99 per pound at Rainbow Grocery) came in
fourth. Most panelists particularly liked the texture, though one
found it chalky and dry. One thought the texture resembled cream
cheese more than ricotta. Some also thought the cheese tasted too
tangy. One would buy it; four would not.
</P>
<P>
   The panel also tasted Formaggi di Ferrante, but it scored too
low to rate.
</P>
<P>
   Panelists were John P. Carroll, cookbook author; Shelley
Handler, consultant and food writer; Roland Passot, chef-owner of
La Folie in San Francisco and Left Bank in Larkspur and Menlo Park;
Kim Severson, Chronicle staff writer; and Kirk Webber, chef-owner,
Cafe Kati, San Francisco. All products are tasted blind.

 Cook's Books: Grilling Is Really Quite Simple  &HT;       
 By David A. Steinberg 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; SAN FRANCISCO _  &LR; I'm sure I'm not the only person to have
experienced Pittsburgh-style grilled chicken _ charred on the
outside, raw on the inside. Or how about chowing down on a batch of
barbecued chicken ``chips'' that could easily be mistaken for the
tiles used as heat shields on the space shuttle.
<P>
   Maybe it's a testosterone thing, but most guys I know who
erroneously profess to be ace grillers refuse to get the help they
so obviously need. It's sort of like asking for directions. To be
fair, however, it's not just a guy thing. Some women I know are
just as territorial around the fire.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of gender, if you like to grill outdoors or know
people who do (especially if they keep serving up hockey pucks
masquerading as burgers) then ``Pacific Grilling,'' by Denis Kelly,
is a great book to have on the shelf.
</P>
<P>
   Most of its premise revolves around using the best ingredients
and careful attention to preparing the fire, be it gas, charcoal or
wood.
</P>
<P>
   The recipes are short and, as a whole, very simple to follow. As
a result of their simplicity, the main ingredient in each recipe is
often the star flavor; Kelly eschews complex, multilayered sauces
that are often just overwhelming.
</P>
<P>
   This approach is evident in the recipe for Grilled Lamb Chops
With Rosemary-Garlic Paste. Just the title alone covers half of the
ingredients; the rest are salt, pepper and olive oil.
</P>
<P>
   Nowhere have I found a simpler or quicker recipe that yields
results worthy of any type of dinner party _ from homey to elegant.
The paste-rub highlights the flavors and tenderness of the lamb.
But be warned: This is no recipe for inferior meat. Any flaws in
the lamb will be more than obvious after grilling. And as with all
lamb dishes, trimming off every bit of fat is essential to success.
</P>
<P>
   Yet another recipe where the quality of the meat is paramount is
the Seared Tuna With Togarishi Pepper and Wasabi Mustard Sauce.
Once again, the recipe title says most of it. But the catch is yet
another hit to the wallet: The tuna has to be sushi-grade _ not
just because the flavor comes shining through, but because, as the
title suggests, the center is basically raw, and any lesser grade
may jeopardize your intestinal constitution, if not your health.
</P>
<P>
   But Kelly does have more than a few recipes that use sauces a
little more forcefully, such as Michael's Grilled Duck Breasts with
Berry Pinot Noir Glaze, a recipe from Michael Wild, the owner and
chef of Oakland's Bay Wolf restaurant. Not only does this recipe
use one of my favorite spices _ juniper berries _ but it also does
a wonderful job at rendering out most of the fat from the duck
breasts without overcooking the meat. The recipe could easily be
adapted to boneless chicken thighs.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly, a native Californian who lives in Oakland, does a nice
job of offering both a wide range of recipes and some techniques on
the art of grilling. He also includes a short appendix listing
sources of accessories, specialty foods and ingredients _ Tokyo
Fish Market in Berkeley, for example, is an excellent resource for
sushi-quality tuna.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly has done an excellent job at reintroducing us to the
simplicities of grilling. So fire up!

MICHAEL'S GRILLED DUCK BREASTS WITH BERRY PINOT NOIR GLAZE
</P>
<P>
   Michael Wild is the owner of Oakland's Bay Wolf restaurant.
Every year he travels up to Oregon to cook at the McMinnville Pinot
Noir Festival, where his duck and lamb dishes go beautifully with
the fragrant Pinot Noirs from the surrounding region. The trick
with grilling duck is to render the fat from the skin over a
medium-low fire. Serve this with fresh corn and green beans sauteed
in a little rendered duck fat or olive oil.
</P>
<P>
   Ingredients:
</P>
<P>
   6 boneless duck breasts
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons juniper berries, toasted and ground in a spice
grinder
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon coriander seeds, toasted and ground in a spice
grinder
</P>
<P>
   Salt and freshly ground black pepper
</P>
<P>
   1 cup duck or chicken stock
</P>
<P>
   1 basket raspberries or other similar berries
</P>
<P>
   3/4 cup Pinot Noir or other dry red wine
</P>
<P>
   1 shallot, minced
</P>
<P>
   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   Prepare the fire for direct grilling. Spray or rub the grill
with oil.
</P>
<P>
   Sprinkle the meat side of the duck breasts lightly with juniper,
coriander, salt and pepper. Reserve any leftover spices for the
sauce.
</P>
<P>
   Grill the duck breasts skin side down over medium-low heat until
the skin is browned and crisp and the fat is rendered, about 20 to
30 minutes. Move the duck to a cooler part of the grill if
flare-ups occur. Turn the duck breasts over to seal the meat side
and cook for 1 to 3 minutes more until medium-rare to medium, about
130 degrees to 135 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   Remove the duck breasts from the heat, cover loosely with
aluminum foil, and let rest for 10 to 15 minutes while you make the
sauce.
</P>
<P>
   In a small saucepan, simmer the stock, raspberries (reserve 1/4
cup for garnish), Pinot Noir, shallot and remaining spices for 10
minutes, stirring constantly. Strain the sauce through a stainless
steel sieve and reduce over high heat until it is thickened and
glossy.
</P>
<P>
   Pour the sauce over the duck breasts and garnish with the
remaining berries.
</P>
<P>
   Serves 4 to 6.

morels can sell for $45 a pound or more in Bay Area markets _ a
prospect that makes gathering your own an attractive alternative.
To the uninitiated, how and where to search _ and even what to hunt

   HERSH-MCCAFFREY (Washington) _ Pulitzer-Prize winning journalist
Seymour Hersh defends his controversial New Yorker article in which
he alleges that retired Army Gen. Barry McCaffrey ordered an
unprovoked attack against retreating Iraqi soldiers two days after
a cease-fire was announced in the 1991 Persian Gulf War. The
article also alleges that U.S. forces under McCaffrey's command
opened fire on some 380 Iraqi prisoners. The Army denies both
allegations and the White House has attacked the article. By ERIC
ROSENBERG.

<P>
   CIR-WEATHER-ONLINE (Undated) _ Carey Hoffman describes himself
as a weather nut. Since he was 9 years old and a tornado touched
down one block from his house in the suburbs of Cincinnati, Mr.
Hoffman has been in pursuit of information about the weather. ``The
day we got cable TV was a great day,'' said Hoffman, who saw his
first radar screen displaying weather information on a local cable
channel. The debut of the Weather Channel in 1982 was another
bright day for Hoffman. But it is the Internet that has made
Hoffman and others like him feel as if they are in weather
paradise. By Bonnie Rothman Morris.

   CIR-ONLINE-GAMER (Undated) _ The portrait of the online gamer as
a young incipient sociopath is inaccurate, game industry experts
say. Although fans of ultraviolent first-person shooter games
helped establish the culture of online gaming, there now is an
entirely new ruling class. These days, Internet gamers are not some
clan of elusive teenage demons. More likely, they are Mom and Dad,
playing games like hearts and bingo. By David Kushner.

<P>
   CIR-COMPUTER-COLUMN (Stockholm) _ The weekly column: The Big
Bang of telecommunications is now on the horizon, the long-awaited
moment when a third-generation of Internet-based mobile phone
applications and services will sweep across the world, changing
personal communications in a more profound way than the arrival of
the personal computer changed computing two decades ago. At least,
that is what they say at Nokia in Finland and at Ericsson in
Sweden, two of the largest makers of wireless telecommunications
equipment in the world. But the third-generation phones they are
talking about, so-called 3G phones, are still several years,
perhaps five years away for most of the world, according to
research scientists and wireless services developers here and in
Helsinki. By Peter H. Lewis.

<P>
   AUSTIN-HOUSE (Hartford, Conn. _ Arthur Everett Austin Jr., or
Chick, as he was known from childhood, managed to have the last
word on himself, by getting the first one in. ``The house is just
like me,'' he told critics and admirers of the 86-foot-wide,
one-room-deep, painted-wood Palladian villa with the Venetian
baroque and International style interiors. ``All facade.'' After 20
months and half a million dollars of cosmetic labor, the
``pasteboard palace,'' as local grandees dubbed it, will greet
Hartford society again. The Atheneum, which now owns the Austin
house and has restored it, will unveil it to trustees next
Thursday. By William L. Hamilton.

   PLANT-BUYING (Undated) _ When it comes to buying plants, I don't
like to order them on the Web. If it's something simple I'm after,
like more purple coneflowers or a couple of Miss Kim lilacs, I'll
head for a favorite nursery and wander down those aisles of trees,
shrubs and perennials. I flirt with all kinds of plants I don't
need, touching the leaves, sizing up their height, branching, color
and general health. By Ann Raver.

   CLINTON-EU _ LISBON, Portugal _ President Clinton warned
Wednesday of a ``new urgency'' in Middle East peace talks amid
recent developments in the region. He also said he favors a
national missile defense system that would protect U.S. allies _ as
Texas Gov. George W. Bush endorsed last week _ as well as the
United States. Clinton's meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak will be held Thursday in Lisbon, before he departs for

   MEXICO-VOTEBUYING _ MEXICO CITY _ Complaints that the PRI,
Mexico's ruling party, is using welfare programs to coerce votes
for this country's July 2 election prompted President Ernesto
Zedillo to give a speech this week claiming the aid is free of
``political manipulation.'' But a national magazine this week also
published an interview that contradicted Zedillo's version of
reality. With little more than a month to go before the
presidential election here, a controversial aide to the PRI's
candidate said: ``federal social programs are carried out by the
PRI, and their aim is to win the presidency.'' (Ferriss, Cox News
Service).

   OLY-BEIJING _ BEIJING _ Wang Wei has one especially fond memory
of the Atlanta Olympics: viewing the wild celebration that followed
the announcement that the city had been selected to host the games.
He hopes residents of Beijing will be able to take part in an even
wilder celebration when they are awarded the 2008 games. Wang and a
carefully selected team of staffers have taken over a floor in a
downtown Beijing hotel to map out plans they hope will secure the
bid. But Wang, the secretary general of the Beijing Olympics
Committee, knows that his city has come close before, only to be
bitterly disappointed. (Graham, Atlanta Journal-Constitution). WITH

how the problem affects all of society. This week, the third summit
will issue a call for community action. (Dart, Cox News Service).

   It is just now the end of May, and already the temperature has

summer. Of course, the way we'll deal with the debilitating heat is
to leave our air-conditioned homes, go out in the back yard and
start open fires on which to cook our meat. Certainly that only
makes it hotter, but you are allowed to drink all the beer you
want. Besides, many Texans believe that the Lone Star State is the
birthplace of barbecue and that we have an important tradition to
uphold. By ART CHAPMAN. Story will move in ``d'' food and dining

   Some of these death penalty opponents must have nothing to do
but fret over the fate of convicted killers and respond to
newspaper columnists who disagree with them.
</P>
<P>
   I have some advice for these folks: Get a life.
</P>
<P>
   That may take a while, so while we're waiting, I'll take a
moment to address the anti-capital punishment crowd's indignation
over civilized society's cold-hearted audacity in demanding the
ultimate punishment for the ultimate crime. If I may paraphrase
Oliver Stone's corporate raider in ``Wall Street:'' Capital
punishment is _ for lack of a better word _ good.
</P>
<P>
   But that's a piece of logic that escapes the death penalty
opponents. We're talking about a mind-set that consistently devises
mindless criticisms of capital punishment _ and of those who
support it. The latest rebuke directed at me is one of my all-time
favorites.
</P>
<P>
   In reply to my contention that innocent people are not being
executed in this country, the anti-execution folks have been
telling me that I need to check my ``facts.''
</P>
<P>
   And just exactly what facts do they offer to refute my
assertion?
</P>
<P>
   None. Zero. Not any.
</P>
<P>
   What they offer instead is the well-worn information that the
state of Illinois recently discovered that a number of its Death
Row denizens may have been innocent of the crimes for which they
were condemned to die. They offer this as evidence that innocent
people are being executed.
</P>
<P>
   I beg to differ. What the Illinois situation actually shows is
that innocent people are not being executed.
</P>
<P>
   It is unacceptable, no doubt about it, if defendants are being
wrongly convicted and sentenced to death for crimes they didn't
commit. But that doesn't mean there's a problem with the death
penalty; it means there's a problem with the process that leads to
conviction.
</P>
<P>
   Defendants who are convicted of capital offenses and sent to
Death Row are afforded ample opportunity to prove that they are
innocent or that they didn't receive a fair trial or that there is
some mitigating circumstance that should spare them the just
punishment assigned them by a jury of their peers.
</P>
<P>
   In Texas, the state so often derided as the capital punishment
capital of the world, a Death Row convict is awarded an appeal _
regardless of whether the inmate wants it. Condemned killers who
beg to be executed often find it difficult to get their wish
because so many do-gooders are scrambling to shield them from the
lethal needle.
</P>
<P>
   Multiple slasher/mutilator Larry Keith Robison was subjected to
one last competency hearing even after he pleaded with his
partisans to file no more appeals on his behalf. There was no
question about his guilt. He understood his fate and desperately
wanted to get on with it _ but the bleeding hearts insisted on
prolonging this brutal murderer's disgusting life.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, thank goodness, Robison got the injection he
deserved _ and justice was served.
</P>
<P>
   The appellate process in death penalty cases can drag on for 10
years, 15 years, 20 years. That should be more than enough time for
an innocent convict to prove his innocence.
</P>
<P>
   It was more than enough for those Death Row inmates in Illinois.
It was enough for confessed serial killer Henry Lee Lucas, whose
death sentence was commuted to life in prison because he may not
have committed the one murder for which he was sentenced to die.
</P>
<P>
   Facts? The fact is, there is plenty of evidence that people who
are wrongly convicted don't get executed. If the anti-capital
punishment lobby has a list of people who were executed and later
proved to be innocent, please send me the list as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
   I'm talking about people who were actually innocent, you
understand, not hideous vermin like Gary Graham, who has evaded the
death chamber for darn near 20 years by means of frivolous appeals
and outrageous delays. When this animal is finally executed _ soon,
if all goes well _ some folks will offer up his fate as evidence
that innocent people are being executed.
</P>
<P>
   Ridiculous.

DESPITE US LINK, GLOBAL MARKETS HAVE ROOM TO GROW 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN SYRE AND CHARLES STEIN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Nasdaq Composite index is down 15 percent for the year. The
Mexican stock market is down 16 percent, Brazil 12 percent, Great
Britain 15 percent, Spain 15 percent, Japan 17 percent, and Hong
Kong 17 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Raise your hand if you detect a pattern here.
</P>
<P>
   The global village has turned into the global stock market.
Practically everywhere you turn, stocks are down roughly in line
with the decline in US stocks.
</P>
<P>
   The worldwide sell-off has made life difficult for US investors
who ventured offshore in search of something better or at least
something different. More significantly, the tight link among
markets raises a question: Is international diversification dead?
</P>
<P>
   Investors have long been encouraged to keep a portion of their
money in overseas markets on the theory that those markets will
rise and fall at different times than US markets. If we just have
one big market today, does it still make sense to leave home?
</P>
<P>
   Most money managers say yes. ``We definitely feel international
diversification is still a viable strategy,'' said Steven Norwitz,
an executive with T. Rowe Price. Research at T. Rowe Price shows
that over long periods of time _ say three to five years _ American
markets and international markets move in very different patterns.
</P>
<P>
   Over shorter time frames, especially during difficult times,
however, the differences can disappear. ``You get a quick Pavlovian
reaction,'' said Allen Sinai, chief economist at Primark Decisions
Economics. ``If the US goes down, everyone goes down.''
</P>
<P>
   Market strategists say the worldwide drop in stocks this year
can be attributed to the confluence of three separate forces. The
three are:
</P>
<P>
   --Technology. When the United States fell in love with
technology stocks last year, the rest of the world was not far
behind. Internet companies, telecom companies, and software
companies had a worldwide rally and just as they did here, many
stocks soared to unsustainable heights. When the prices of American
tech stocks started to crumble, investors everywhere got nervous.
Softbank, a popular Japanese Internet stock, is down 70 percent
since February. Some money managers say that when it comes to
technology, there really is just one big stock market. ``You are
talking about an industry that is already globalized,'' said Lisa
Svensson, manager of Putnam's Global Growth fund. It remains to be
seen how tight that link will prove to be over time.
</P>
<P>
   --Currency. Most European stock markets this year are not doing
all that badly measured in local currencies. But when you factor in
the steep decline in the euro versus the dollar, the numbers look a
lot worse. If the euro rallies, as it has done for the last few
days, European markets may look better going forward.
</P>
<P>
   --Economic links. In large measure, US stocks are down because
investors anticipate a slowing in the US economy. Should that come
to pass, other countries will feel the impact. That economic link
explains why some markets, Mexico's for example, fall in sympathy
with ours. Syl Marquardt, research director of John Hancock Funds,
points out another economic tie. In many emerging markets, both in
Latin America and Asia, the governments link their currencies
tightly to the US dollar. When the United States raises interest
rates, those countries too must raise their rates and suffer the
consequences.
</P>
<P>
   Despite this year's synchronized sell-off, money managers
continue to believe overseas markets are appealing. In fact, most
expect Europe and Japan to outperform the United States over the
next few years.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Moore of State Street Research uses a baseball analogy to
explain why. The United States, he says, is in the eighth inning of
its economic expansion; Europe is in the fifth or sixth inning;
Japan only the second or third.
</P>
<P>
   In nonbaseball terms, that means both Europe and Japan have more
room to grow without bumping up against their limits or worrying
about inflation. What's more, both places are not as far along as
the United States in the deregulation of their industries or the
penetration of technology in their societies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Outside the US there is still a lot of good news to come,''
said Allen Sinai.
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line from money managers: The world may be getting
more homogenous, but we aren't all the same just yet.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Herring
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Breakaway Solutions, a Boston-based e-consulting
firm, decided to scrap its plans for a secondary stock offering
because the market for technology stocks was deteriorating.
</P>
<P>
   But Breakaway has found another way to raise money. On Tuesday,
the company announced that it sold 1.5 million shares to Putnam
Investments in a private placement. The money _ $39 million _ will
be put up by four Putnam mutual funds.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a perfect world, we wouldn't be selling at this price,''
said Gordon Brooks, Breakaway's chief executive. ``But this isn't a
perfect world, and this way if the markets don't turn around, we
have a cushion.''
</P>
<P>
   Breakaway's stock closed at $22.50 Tuesday, down from a peak of
$79 in March.
</P>
<P>
   Brooks said Putnam approached him and actually wanted to buy
even more of the company. When the deal goes through, Putnam will
own 8.8 percent of Breakaway.

as a weather nut. Since he was 9 years old and a tornado touched
down one block from his house in the suburbs of Cincinnati, Mr.
Hoffman has been in pursuit of information about the weather. ``The
day we got cable TV was a great day,'' said Hoffman, who saw his
first radar screen displaying weather information on a local cable

personal communications in a more profound way than the arrival of
the personal computer changed computing two decades ago. At least,
that is what they say at Nokia in Finland and at Ericsson in
Sweden, two of the largest makers of wireless telecommunications
equipment in the world. But the third-generation phones they are

SOFTBANK MISSES DEADLINE TO ACQUIRE NIPPON CREDIT BANK 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: This early version will be updated as needed.) 
 By STEPHANIE STROM   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ The Softbank Corp., Japan's leading Internet company,
was dealt a setback Wednesday in efforts to acquire a large
insolvent bank nationalized by the government, which said it would
seek other possible buyers.
</P>
<P>
   An investment group led by Softbank had won the exclusive right
to negotiate the purchase of the Nippon Credit Bank three months
ago, in what was described at the time as a deal with far-reaching
implications for Japan's banking and Internet industries. But the
deadline for reaching an agreement, which had been extended once,
expired Wednesday with little progress made on terms.
</P>
<P>
   The Financial Reconstruction Commission, the regulatory agency
overseeing the overhaul of Japan's troubled financial sector, said
it intends to keep talking to the Softbank-led group, which
includes Orix Corp., one of Japan's largest leasing companies, and
Tokio Fire and Marine Insurance Co. But the agency said it would
also talk to other potential bidders.
</P>
<P>
   Regulators said they could not agree with the Softbank group on
the scope of Nippon Credit Bank's bad loans and the value of the
collateral backing those and other loans. ``Those three each had an
opinion over how to estimate and deal with bad loans,'' said Shoji
Mori, a senior commission official. ``The situation at the final
meeting was that we were far from reaching an agreement.''
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, the Softbank-led group, which had tentatively
offered 100 billion yen, or about $938 million at current exchange
rates, for the bank, said it would continue to pursue Nippon
Credit.
</P>
<P>
   Some financial analysts were betting that the Softbank group
would win the bank, one of two big banks nationalized during
Japan's financial crisis in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have a credible business plan, and they want the
bank,''said Dean Perry, an analyst who tracks non-bank financial
companies at ING Barings.
</P>
<P>
   Government officials, speaking privately, said the failure to
meet Wednesday's deadline reflected political concerns over how
much responsibility the government would be forced to accept for
loans that sour after the sale.
</P>
<P>
   The commission has recently been criticized by politicians over
the terms of its deal to sell the Long-Term Credit Bank, the other
nationalized bank, to an investment group led by Ripplewood
Holdings LLC, a U.S. investment fund.
</P>
<P>
   Long-Term Credit Bank has emerged as the largest creditor of
several firms that have recently gone bankrupt or asked their
creditors for substantial debt forgiveness. Under the terms of
Ripplewood's agreement, the government must take responsibility for
bad loans that arise from such circumstances, lessening
Ripplewood's risk.
</P>
<P>
   Political concerns about the sale of these banks have come as
the country prepares for contentious parliamentary elections that
could weaken the power of the dominant Liberal Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   Approval ratings for the Cabinet led by Prime Minister Yoshiro
Mori plunged to a record post-war low this week, according to a
poll done by the Asahi Shimbun.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the setback to Softbank, some analysts welcomed the
possibility that it may not acquire Nippon Credit.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought this was a very expensive way to buy a banking
license that came with too much legacy management,'' said Thomas
Rodes, who follows Japan's Internet industry at Nikko Salomon Smith
Barney.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The failure to reach a deal by Wednesday's deadline did not come
as a complete surprise. Japan's Internet business community has
buzzed with rumors that Softbank's ardor for the deal was cooling.
</P>
<P>
   Yoshitaka Kitao, president and chief executive of Softbank
Finance Corp., Softbank's financing subsidiary, has been openly
debating the wisdom of buying into Nippon Credit Bank with
Masayoshi Son, Softbank's founder and chief executive, who wants to
use the bank to finance the fledgling companies that have
historically lacked access to bank financing here.
</P>
<P>
   Kitao has questioned whether Softbank can assume the risk of a
bank that has a sizable portfolio of bad loans, particularly at a
time when Softbank's own financing is considered shaky. The company
has a speculative credit rating, its stock has fallen more than 73
percent since February and earnings plunged 77 percent in the
fiscal year that ended March 31.
</P>
<P>
   Son has dismissed such concerns, saying Softbank has more cash
on hand than the total of its debts due for the next eight years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have enough reserves to repay all debts at once if we
want,'' he told a news conference last week.

<P>
   We're looking for a hot summer.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the way we'll deal with the debilitating heat is to
leave our air-conditioned homes, go out in the back yard and start
open fires on which to cook our meat.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly that only makes it hotter, but you are allowed to
drink all the beer you want. Besides, many Texans believe that the
Lone Star State is the birthplace of barbecue and that we have an
important tradition to uphold.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Flemmons, the Fort Worth Star-Telegram writer who
considered Texas chauvinism to be a high calling, once wrote that
``Texas foods, jazz, jeans and Elvis souvenirs are the only true
American art forms, recognizable around the world.''
</P>
<P>
   The Texas food he was referring to was barbecue.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, there are only three Texas foods anyway. The other two
are fried and Tex-Mex.
</P>
<P>
   Like most devout Texans, Flemmons understood the state's
emotional ties to barbecue. It is not only a cooking method, but a
challenge. Texans believe that they can barbecue anything they can
clean, but they prefer to barbecue beef.
</P>
<P>
   Flemmons was certain the word barbecue came from the Spanish
word barbacoa. Some people say it is a Spanish word, others say it
is Indian. In either case, it isn't exactly what most people
consider barbecue. Flemmons figured the old chuck-wagon cooks tried
it, mispronounced it, and therefore claimed it as their own. He
might have been right, but nevertheless, it is not uniquely Texan.
</P>
<P>
   Barbacoa is a festive kind of dish generally reserved for
special events, or at least weekends. In ``Homestyle Mexican
Cooking,'' Ida Romo writes, ``Pits are used as ovens in many parts
of the world. Mexico has the barbacoa.''
</P>
<P>
   In this variation, the large leaves of the maguey or agave plant
are used to line a pit, and a pig, calf or lamb is cooked in it.
Barbacoa is an ancient method of cooking that is still popular in
some parts of Mexico for large fiestas and family gatherings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Barbacoas are held most often in the state of Mexico,'' Romo
writes, ``but also in the Yucatan, where banana leaves are used to
wrap the meat.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the United States, where the other leaves are hard to come
by, use corn husks or aluminum foil instead.''
</P>
<P>
   Chicago chef (but native Oklahoman) Rick Bayless pretty much
agrees, but in his book ``Rick Bayless's Mexican Kitchen,'' he
leaves beef out altogether: ``When barbacoa is the featured fiesta
food, the party is usually in a rural setting. Traditionally,
barbacoa consists of a fresh-slaughtered pig, goat or lamb that's
marinated or not, wrapped in aromatic leaves and cooked in a
wood-fired pit in the ground _ a cross between steaming, roasting
and smoking.''
</P>
<P>
   Texans kind of liked the idea, all right, but they wanted beef.
It was just a little awkward trying to wrap a whole cow in leaves
and then dropping it in a pit. So, they just did the head.
</P>
<P>
   In ``The Texas Cookbook, Culinary &AMP; Campfire Lore from the Lone
Star State,'' by Arthur and Bobbie Coleman, the instructions are
straightforward:
</P>
<P>
   ``Dig a hole three feet deep. Build a fire in it and let the
fire burn down to coals. Cover the coals with three inches of dirt.
While the fire is burning down to coals, prepare the calf's head.
</P>
<P>
   ``Leave the hide on the head, and leave enough skin on the neck
to cover the cut portion. Remove the windpipe and wash the opening
thoroughly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wrap the head in a tow sack. Put the wrapped head in another
tow sack which has been thoroughly soaked with water. Place in the
hole. Cover with three inches of dirt. Build a fire on top of the
dirt, and let the head bake for 15 hours. When done, it will feed
about 6 hungry cow hands.''
</P>
<P>
   Pretty darned simple, but admit it, not what you consider
barbecue.
</P>
<P>
   To try it for yourself, here's a more contemporary version done
in an oven. You can buy a ``cabeza,'' or beef head, at local
Hispanic markets, but you might want to use eye of round or brisket
or any beef roast.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   BARBACOA CABEZA
</P>
<P>
   1 cabeza, brisket or roast (See note)
</P>
<P>
   4 onions, quartered
</P>
<P>
   3 heads garlic, separated
</P>
<P>
   2 bunches cilantro, separated
</P>
<P>
   Corn or flour tortillas
</P>
<P>
   Salt to taste
</P>
<P>
   Place first four ingredients in a large baking bag; the kind
used for roasting a large turkey. Put the bag in a baking dish on
the bottom rack of a 200-degree oven. On another rack place a
heat-proof container with water. It will help keep the meat moist
during the long cooking period. Cook the beef for 5 hours,
occasionally checking the water level.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the cooking period, allow the meat to cool
slightly, then shred it with a fork. The meat should be moist, but
if not, add drippings from bag as needed.
</P>
<P>
   Salt to taste and serve with tortillas.
</P>
<P>
   Note: Lamb, pork or goat can be substituted. Chicken doesn't
stand up well to the long cooking.

BEWARE OF TRYING TO OUTGUESS THE MARKET

<P>
   Problem: Allocating 401(k) assets; funding IRA through day
trading
</P>
<P>
   Income: $31,000 annually
</P>
<P>
   401(k) balance: $22,000
</P>
<P>
   Contributions: 6 percent of earnings, plus 3 percent match
</P>
<P>
   401(k) options:
</P>
<P>
   Putnam OTC Emerging Growth fund
</P>
<P>
   Templeton Foreign fund, Class A
</P>
<P>
   George Putnam Fund of Boston
</P>
<P>
   MFS Research fund
</P>
<P>
   Vanguard Institutional Index fund
</P>
<P>
   Vanguard Extended Market Index fund
</P>
<P>
   Merrill Lynch Global Growth fund, Class A
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q. &LR;  My 401(k) is merging into a new plan with a new set of
investment choices. I want to invest aggressively for the next five
years and am planning to increase my contribution to the 401(k) to
10 percent of my earnings. I am also planning to shelter about
$2,000 a year in an IRA _ this money will come from day trading in
stocks. How do you suggest I allocate my 401(k) money?
</P>
<P>
   J.S., West Roxbury, Mass. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A &LR; . Despite your desire to take an aggressive stance, I
nonetheless suggest you begin with a core position representing
half of your current balance and half of your contributions in
Vanguard Institutional Index fund. As you may learn in day trading,
trying to outguess the market is a very risky business, and you're
best off putting the largest investment in the broad index
represented by Vanguard's Institutional Standard and Poor's 500
fund.
</P>
<P>
   I suggest you then divide the remainder of your 401(k) money and
contributions among Putnam OTC Emerging Growth, Templeton Foreign
fund, and MFS Research fund, although I would watch the latter
fairly closely. By its name you would likely infer that the fund
takes heavy positions in health care and technology stocks, but the
current portfolio presented by Morningstar Mutual Funds shows very
little concentration there. Aside from underweighting utilities,
durables, and staples and overweighting in energy stocks, the fund
does not stray far from the makeup of the Standard and Poor's 500
Index.
</P>
<P>
   I think the idea of supplementing the 401(k) with an IRA is
solid, although I think your plan of funding it through the profits
from day trading is problematical. If you use a traditional IRA,
the account is tax-deferred rather than sheltered _ you'll owe
taxes on the money when it is withdrawn later on. If you use a Roth
IRA, you are basically prepaying the taxes by funding it with
after-tax dollars. In that case, any gains you achieve in such an
account are indeed permanently sheltered from taxation.
</P>
<P>
   If you do plan to fund the IRA with profits from day trading, I
suggest you adopt one strict discipline, which is not to tap into
the IRA in the event that your day trading ventures end up where
most of them do _ in losses. If you have to tap either a
traditional or Roth IRA prematurely _ before age 59 1/2 in both
cases, and before five years have elapsed for the Roth _ you will
face penalties for early withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
   Needless to say, I would be happier if you decided to fund your
IRA with regular contributions of $166 a month from your earnings
and keep any profits _ or losses _ that day trading might generate
in a completely separate account.
</P>
<P>
   Since there is no offering within the 401(k) that concentrates
on the field, I suggest you put your IRA money in Vanguard Health
Care fund.
</P>
<P>
   Problem: Should I cash out and invest my retirement plan?
</P>
<P>
   Retirement account: $8,500 invested in a money market account
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q. &LR;  I built my $8,500 balance in a tax-deferred retirement
account while working for a former employer. The plan offers no
other investment beyond the money market account, which is bringing
me $340 a year. I am thinking of cashing it in and investing the
proceeds fairly aggressively in mutual funds, where I would hope to
achieve 10 percent average annual returns. I would face a 10
percent penalty plus federal and state taxes, all totaling $2,630,
but if the returns on the remaining $5,870 are as projected, I
would soon enough catch up. What do you suggest?
</P>
<P>
   J.P., Cambridge, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. You would be much better off if you moved the money to a
rollover IRA, which would let you both avoid the penalties and
continue to defer the taxes. In addition, with a rollover IRA you
will have the option of adding the balance to a future qualified
retirement account, such as a 401(k) if you desire to (although
this option evaporates if you add to the account).
</P>
<P>
   The procedure for creating a rollover IRA is to go to the mutual
fund family you choose and have them receive the money directly
from your old employer's retirement plan. By that means, the money
does not enter your hands and thus the taxes and penalties are not
triggered.
</P>
<P>
   If I were making the move, I would simply move the funds to
Vanguard Index 500 fund, thus putting your reliance upon the 500
dominant American companies.
</P>
<P>
   Problem: Should new options mean investment changes?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q. &LR;  I am a postal employee and expect to retire in about 20
years. I am fully invested in the C fund of the Postal Services
Thrift Savings Plan, which is managed to track the Wells Fargo
Equity Index. Other current options are the G fund, invested in
short-term US Government securities and the F fund, which tracks
the Wells Fargo US Debt Index. In October there will be two new
options: the S fund, tracking a small-cap index and the I fund,
which will track an index of international stocks. Do you think I
should make any change?
</P>
<P>
   C.D., Billerica, Mass. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A. &LR;  Even though small-cap and international stocks are my least
favorite categories to index, I think the broader portfolio
diversity that these offerings provide merits their inclusion in
your portfolio. In both cases, I think a broadly diversified but
managed fund is likely to turn out better results than an index
fund in the long term. If these are the only way that you can get
exposure to these market segments, I would use them. My suggestion
would be to leave 60 percent of your accumulation in the C fund,
and to put 20 percent each into the new offerings, directing that
your ongoing contributions be similarly apportioned.
</P>
<P>
   Problem: Newsletter says no to Vanguard Windsor II
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q. &LR;  The April issue of Louis Rukeyser's Mutual Fund Newsletter
said it no longer considered Vanguard Windsor II to be an
appropriate long-term core holding. Because it is a core holding in
my portfolio, I was distressed. Do you agree with his opinion, and,
if so, what do you consider an appropriate alternative?
</P>
<P>
   W.C., San Diego &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A. &LR;  No, I do not agree with Rukeyser. One of the virtues of
Vanguard Windsor II is that it is a disciplined fund, seeking out
large cap stocks that fall into the value category _ with low
prices relative to their book values. The fund has been pursuing
this discipline since it was formed in 1985, and pursuing it
through markets that have been both good and bad for value-oriented
stocks. This can be seen in its portfolio price-to-earnings ratio
of 22.5, in its price-to-book ratio of 4.0, and in its 2.96 percent
yield. It also can be seen in its year-to-date total return of 2.96
percent, hardly a number to get excited about but comforting at a
time when most stock mutual funds are in the red for 2000. And its
discipline to stick by its mission can be seen in its low turnover
ratio of 26.
</P>
<P>
   If I were you, I would stay with Windsor II. But if you have
become disillusioned with value investments in general, I would go
no further than moving to Vanguard Index 500, which holds a
portfolio that represents a blend of both growth and value stocks.

LILLY IS A LEADING LIGHT AGAIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOE BURRIS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WILTON, Conn. _ Those who favor the phrase, ``You can't go home
again,'' have to bite their tongues around Kristine Lilly. The
``Welcome to Wilton'' sign boasts that it's the former US women's
national soccer team member's hometown. The high school soccer
field is named in her honor. The locals welcomed her with parades
after the team won the Olympic gold medal in 1996 and the World Cup
last year.
</P>
<P>
   She made the townfolks especially proud in the World Cup final
when she stopped a shot by China after goalie Briana Scurry was
beaten on the play. Now, Lilly has them beaming with pride again,
as she is set to further etch her name into American soccer
history.
</P>
<P>
   Lilly is one of several former national team members who will
play in the newly formed (and much-anticipated) women's soccer
league _ the Women's United Soccer Association. She will be the
marquee player for the Boston franchise, one of eight WUSA teams
that will begin play next April.
</P>
<P>
   Scurry, a former standout at the University of Massachusetts,
also will play in the league, as will Brandi Chastain, Mia Hamm,
Michelle Akers and Julie Foudy. Other WUSA teams will be fielded in
Washington, New York, Atlanta, Orlando, Philadelphia, the San
Francisco Bay Area, and San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am delighted for the USA world champions and all the elite
players in America,'' said former national team coach Tony DiCicco,
who will serve as the league's acting commissioner. ``They finally
have a league of their own.''
</P>
<P>
   Lilly said the inception of a women's professional league means
girls like those who play on the soccer field named after her won't
see their careers end at the amateur level.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the greatest thing that has happened to soccer because
basically the national team was all we had to play for,'' said
Lilly via a telephone interview from New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not to take anything away from the national team,'' Lilly
added, ``but players who didn't make the national team had nothing
else to play in. I always wanted to play for the national team, but
I love to play professionally. I'm excited about being in Boston, I
think it's going to be great.''
</P>
<P>
   In February, WUSA was formed by major US media companies and
individual investors. The group was organized by John S. Hendricks,
chairman and CEO of Discovery Communications Inc., the parent
company of the Discovery Channel and The Learning Channel, who will
also oversee the WUSA.
</P>
<P>
   Last Tuesday, Major League Soccer Commissioner Don Garber and
Hendricks announced that the two leagues have agreed to work
together to maximize growth and visibility. Until recently, MLS had
sought to organize the women's league itself.
</P>
<P>
   The formation of the league culminates a dramatic upsurge of
interest in women's sports in general and women's soccer in
particular.
</P>
<P>
   Soccer now is following the lead of women's basketball which
boomed when the US team captured the gold medal in 1996. That led
to the formation of two women's basketball leagues, the now-defunct
American Basketball League and the Women's National Basketball
Association, which kicked off its fourth season this week.
</P>
<P>
   As with women's basketball, talk of a women's soccer league went
on throughout the 1990s. Now that the league is coming to fruition,
players like Lilly aren't bemoaning how long it took.
</P>
<P>
   ``We started at the lowest point, with just a hundred fans a
game,'' said Lilly. ``And then everything escalated. First, the
World Cup was a turning point at the national level, and I knew
(the league) would never happen in 1996. It was not the right time.
But when people like John Hendricks got involved, everyone saw how
passionate people are about women's soccer.''
</P>
<P>
   Now that the league has been formed, folks are anticipating
former teammates battling against each other, players like Hamm and
Chastain attempting to fire shots past Scurry. Lilly, who said the
group has been together for eight years, is looking forward to the
next step as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the US soccer team is unique in that there is no other
sport at the national level where the players have been together so
long,'' she said. ``We have all been a part of the whole movement
of women's soccer, and it's been great to be a part of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Klem ``Whitey'' Budreckas, Lilly's former soccer coach at Wilton
High School, said the league will only get better because the
talent level of teenage players nationwide is greater than when
Lilly was in school.
</P>
<P>
   ``I coach 17-year-olds right now,'' he said, ``and when you look
at those girls play, it's amazing how far they've come. Nothing
against Kristine and when she played, but right now the girls are a
lot closer talentwise. It's amazing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always said it (a major league) would be great to have, but
in the back of our minds, no one dreamed of a professional league.
The women's national team brought forth recognition in the World
Cup and the Olympics. It's great for soccer and for young kids to
follow.''
</P>
<P>
   Budreckas said his only regret is that the WUSA didn't field the
New England team in Connecticut, which he said is now one of the
primary hotbeds for women's amateur soccer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a shame we didn't get one. I remember when you used to
talk about the talent in girls soccer, people talked about Maryland
and Virginia. Now, Connecticut is right there on top,'' he said.

CAN'T TELL 'EM APART WITHOUT A SCORECARD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A recent evening found me hobnobbing at the Canadian Women's
Club, whose members are not necessarily women, nor exclusively
Canadian. That is where I met John Cusack.
</P>
<P>
   This was the same John Cusack who alerted me to the existence of
the Minnie Driver shrine in Cambridge (May 12 column), but not the
downbeat dreamboat John Cusack, who has starred in 44 movies. Like
me, my John Cusack is a huge fan of his Chicago-born namesake. And
he's a fount of Cusack-iana, not only concerning former flame
Driver, but also on family lore.
</P>
<P>
   I had incorrectly assumed that John was related to the veteran
Irish actor Cyril Cusack, and was the brother of acting sisters
Sinead, Sorcha, Niamh, and Catherine. In fact, John is the brother
of acting sisters Joan, Ann, and Susie. Joan and Susie, along with
their father Dick, have roles in the wonderful recent release
``High Fidelity,'' a hilarious and poignant full-employment plan
for the Cusack family.
</P>
<P>
   My John then made a startling assertion about movie star John,
intended as a compliment: ``He's never been bad in a bad movie.''
It's true that Cusack somehow survived ``Pushing Tin,'' but ``Con
Air''? ``Chicago Cab''?
</P>
<P>
   Enough about them. It is time once again to chide parents for
failing to differentiate their children one from another. This is
hardly a recent problem. You will recall in Shakespeare's ``Julius
Caesar,'' the mob chases Cinna, shouting ``tear him to pieces; he's
a conspirator!'' But when the man proves to be Cinna the poet, not
Cinna the politican who has plotted against Caesar, the crowd
cries, ``Tear him for his bad verses!''
</P>
<P>
   A faithful reader has been logging William McDermotts for me and
filed this report: ``The number one Big Mac in my estimation is my
pal Bill McDermott of ML Strategies, a Dukakis-era Economic Affairs
functionary. Because lawyer Bill is from Dorchester originally, he
is often confused by the unwitting with William McDermott of Savin
Hill, one of the handful of Massachusetts lawyers expert at
election law.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both are unlikely to encounter in court the William McDermott
who is a well-known Brookline police officer, who is often quoted
when there is trouble with protests at Brookline abortion clinics.
I don't believe Officer McDermott is a member of the Harvard Club,
which is presently presided over by another William McDermott, this
fellow easily distinguished from the rest because he commonly and
wisely employs his Shavian middle name (Shaw). And then there is
the good Dr. William McDermott, yet another denizen of the Harvard
Club, former president of the Mass. Medical Society, now known also
for his World War II exploits following a recent Globe article.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just when I thought I had exhausted my supply of William
McDermotts, a nice-looking truck drove by the other day, the side
panel emblazoned with the legend _ William McDermott, Painter.
Quality Work. Reasonable Rates.''
</P>
<P>
   If you need a program to keep track of the McDermotts, how about
the three Jayson/Jason Williams playing basketball? Or the
father-son Don Nelsons coaching the Dallas Mavericks? (The boy
spells his first name Donn.) You probably remember when the
Baltimore Orioles tried out two pitchers for spring training named
Michael Anthony Smith. Happily for scorekeepers, only one made the
team. But the inevitable happened almost a year ago today: the
Colorado Rockies' lefthander Bobby Jones went up against the New
York Mets' Bobby Jones. The Gotham hurler surrendered 10 hits and
lost 8-5.
</P>
<P>
   Closer to home, we have the two Michael Goldsteins who are both
Kennedy School graduates and school reform entrepreneurs. And there
are the two Barbara Lees, who were sisters-in-law, and both donate
pots of money to worthy causes. Not long ago, I received an e-mail
from Tim O'Brien, and sycophantically inquired if he was the Tim
O'Brien _ the talented novelist who always poses in a Red Sox cap
to hide his bald pate. The answer came back . . . yes and no. ``No,
I'm just a Tim O'Brien, not the famous author nor the reporter for
ABC News, nor the (former) reporter for the New York Times.''
</P>
<P>
   Hey, Tim, you're my reader _ you will always be the Tim O'Brien
to me.

<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Business consultant and author Tom Peters writes
in the May 22 issue of Time magazine that he believes ``90 percent
of white-collar jobs in the United States will be either destroyed
or altered beyond recognition in the next 10 to 15 years.''
</P>
<P>
   He cites a variety of factors to back up what he calls his
``apparently bizarre'' prediction, but his article begs the
question: Where are those 10 percent of jobs that won't change? My
guess is they're with companies that will react so slowly that they
seem to be oblivious to this monumental change in the world
economy.
</P>
<P>
   So your career has two potential paths: the job headed for
oblivion or the company whose heads are oblivious. It's not a
pretty choice.
</P>
<P>
   The season finale of ``Sports Night'' this month on ABC included
some great workplace irony. As the fictional cable sports channel
on the show is about to be sold, the executive producer meets a man
in a bar who tells her how he became wildly successful, even though
he failed far more than he succeeded.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each time I fail,'' he tells her, ``I get my people together
and say, `Where are we going?' and it starts to get better.''
</P>
<P>
   She scoffs at his simplistic advice, until she finds out that
he's the man buying the cable channel _ and that he plans to keep
the fictional ``Sports Night'' on the air. After all, he says,
``Anybody who can't make money off `Sports Night' should get out of
the money-making business.''
</P>
<P>
   ABC, however, apparently can't make money off the real ``Sports
Night.'' Even though the show was a critical success, the network
canceled it.
</P>
<P>
   It's ironic, too, that although ABC can kill off that fictional
cable channel, cable television channels have been slowly killing
network TV for years. And as the Internet keeps getting faster,
network TV edges closer to oblivion.
</P>
<P>
   That's why Peters' forecast is not as outrageous as it might
appear. Network television hasn't changed all that much in 15 years
_ except, of course for The Philbin Factor _ but its jobs have been
altered dramatically because there is so much more competition.
Just as the network bosses are not exactly loyal to quality shows,
workers and viewers are not exactly loyal to the networks.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, I also realize it's ironic to write about this in a
newspaper, the product of another dying industry. (I also realize
I'm using the word ``ironic'' way, way, way too much, and promise
not to do it again until they bring ``Sports Night'' back.) It's an
industry that clings to the status quo, and although there are some
great newspapers, none has a reputation as a great employer.
</P>
<P>
   So are there no great employers because it's a dying industry _
or is it a dying industry because there are no great employers? I
don't know, but I think we'd all be better off working for the guy
on ``Sports Night.''
</P>
<P>
   Where are we going? Just because your company is oblivious
doesn't mean you should be.
</P>
<P>
   In one way or another, we're all in dying industries. Innovative
grocers and microwave ovens can wipe out restaurants, just as
Amazon.com and Barnes &AMP; Noble can eliminate local bookstores. But
good restaurants and independent bookstores manage to stay in the
money-making business.
</P>
<P>
   Even though technology in general is thriving, companies fail
all the time. And just as many blue-collar workers lost their jobs
to foreign competition, techies could well see more jobs outsourced
to places like China and India.
</P>
<P>
   So, assuming Peters is right, how do you protect yourself? Find
smart people and hook up with them, as a partner or as a boss or as
a follower. Think about whether your company's vision for the
future looks out far enough to suit your future. A status quo
company might be just what you want at 55, but not at 25.
</P>
<P>
   Is your company a good employer? This isn't just a warm and
fuzzy question, but a practical one. As baby boomers reach
retirement age, the competition for talent will intensify. There
are exceptions, of course, but companies with a reputation as good
employers also tend to do well financially. That is not a
coincidence.
</P>
<P>
   Are you failing enough? Certainly you want to build up a pattern
of success, but often you learn more from your failures. If all you
have are successes, maybe you're not pushing yourself hard enough
to try new things.
</P>
<P>
   Have you tried moonlighting in another career or thought about
starting your own business? Do you push for challenging
assignments? Can you honestly say that you work with people who are
smarter than you? If you had to take a temporary step down to move
to a competitor with a more promising future, would you do it?
</P>
<P>
   Have you ever thought that your career is demanding such long
hours that you're cheating yourself out of a life? Sometimes the
best career ideas come out of your leisure time.
</P>
<P>
   Careers used to follow logical paths, and industries took
decades to evolve. Now everything operates on microwave time, and
you can get burned before you know it.
</P>
<P>
   Having a comfortable job used to be the American workplace
dream, but now that comfort is deceiving. Those who don't take
risks may be more likely to get microwaved than those who do.
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't really matter which came first: the chicken employee
or the employer who laid an egg. All that matters is that
everyone's future will be scrambled.

ILLINOIS LAB ACCUSES CANCER EXPERT OF PATENT FRAUD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RAJA MISHRA  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ An Illinois pharmaceutical company has sued Children's
Hospital and its star cancer researcher, claiming that Dr. Judah
Folkman and his team of doctors falsely took credit for a medical
breakthrough that could lead to the development of drugs that
starve malignant tumors to death.
</P>
<P>
   The suit, filed Tuesday in US District Court in Boston, does not
affect any of the high-profile clinical trials of tumor-starving
drugs, called angiogenesis inhibitors, underway at various
hospitals around the country.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit highlights the intense competition and complexity
surrounding the recently accelerated race to find a cure for cancer
and other diseases, where a patent on a single molecule can be
worth billions of dollars in royalties.
</P>
<P>
   In the 21-page complaint, Abbott Laboratories says Folkman
``fraudulently'' told US patent reviewers that he discovered the
tumor-inhibiting properties of a small section of an angiostatin
protein known by scientists as Kringle 5. Abbott scientist Donald
Davidson made the actual breakthrough and Abbott is the rightful
owner of the patent, the complaint states. In 1995, Folkman and his
team took Davidson's research and, in violation of a
confidentiality agreement, sought to profit from it without
Abbott's knowledge, Abbott maintains.
</P>
<P>
   Folkman responded: ``This dispute comes down to Children's
Hospital wanting to protect its patent rights and Abbott wanting to
avoid paying any royalties. I have no personal interest in this
matter and hope that Kringle 5 continues to test well and
progresses from the laboratory to further stages of development so
that it can eventually benefit patients.''
</P>
<P>
   Abbott is asking the court to transfer the credit and patent for
the discovery to it. The company also wants assessment of $10
million in punitive damages and compensation for any other losses
incurred because of the alleged fraud. Abbott also wants the
licensing rights for any drug that results from the discovery, a
right that now belongs to EntreMed Inc., a Rockville, Md., company
that has exclusive rights to 24 patents based on the work of
Folkman and his colleagues at Children's Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   The two sides have been trying to settle the case for three
years, and were in negotiations as recently as Friday. Children's
Hospital requested that a third-party arbitrator be allowed to step
in, but Abbott resisted, according to a source familiar with the
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Abbott said: ``Abbott has thoroughly
investigated this issue and has attempted to reach a settlement
with the defendants. Unfortunately, the parties could not reach a
resolution. We intend to vigorously pursue this case.''
</P>
<P>
   An attorney for EntreMed said the suit is a routine patent
dispute that will nonetheless receive much attention because of
Folkman's high profile.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question here is: Who was the first inventor? These are
not uncommon types of lawsuits,'' said Atlanta-based patent
specialist James D. Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   EntreMed and Children's Hospital are expected to file their
responses within 20 days.
</P>
<P>
   The controversy is an outgrowth of Folkman's watershed 1971
insight that cancerous tumors might be vulnerable if their ability
to siphon blood from arteries were somehow crippled. Tumors release
substances that ``grow'' new blood vessels to the tumor from
existing blood vessels _ a process called angiogenesis. This allows
them to thrive and spread.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, Folkman and his colleagues filed a patent application
claiming that a protein named angiostatin prevents angiogenesis.
Angiostatin is part of a larger protein called plasminogen, which
helps blood clot. Plasminogen, at that time, was known to contain
five regions, consisting of danish-shaped structures dubbed
Kringles. Folkman found that Kringles 1 through 4 stopped
angiogenesis. Whether Kringle 5 had similar properties was unknown.
</P>
<P>
   Davidson, a Notre Dame-educated specialist on plasminogen and
Kringles, began researching tumors for Abbott in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   According to court documents, shortly after Folkman's patent of
angiostatin, one of his colleagues, Dr. Yihai Cao, called Davidson.
He requested help in Kringle research. He also wanted hard-to-get
plasminogen to conduct tests with. He called the right man:
Davidson was skilled at the difficult process of separating Kringle
sections, and his employer had one of the few stockpiles of
plasminogen in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Davidson and Abbott agreed to help, according to the documents.
In 1995, Abbott got Folkman to sign a confidentiality agreement
because some of the research Davidson was sharing had the potential
to benefit Abbott.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Davidson had a breakthrough of his own,
according to the court documents: He was able to create a new form
of Kringle 5 that showed greater tumor-starving potential than any
of the other Kringle sections. An excited Davidson told Folkman,
whose lab was able to confirm the discovery.
</P>
<P>
   According to court documents, Folkman congratulated Davidson's
supervisor and advised him that Abbott should file for a patent. In
personal notes from Dec. 1, 1995, Folkman even chided himself for
having ``overlooked'' Kringle 5, according to the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   But 12 days later an attorney for EntreMed, which works with
Folkman, filed a patent application for Kringle 5. It was approved.
Abbott was never told, according to the lawsuit, and instead ``the
defendants kept their scheme to patent Abbott's Kringle 5 invention
secret from Abbott.''
</P>
<P>
   The Kringle 5 discovery has no part in the much-watched test of
angiostatin that began in April at the Thomas Jefferson University
Hospital in Philadelphia. That drug involves only Kringles 1
through 3. The test, which is expected to conclude this summer, is
simply to see if the drug is safe to take before more extensive
patient tests can be conducted. Another, more promising, drug
derived from Folkman's work, endostatin, has already entered the
more extensive testing phase.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that the Kringle 5 discovery is not being tested in
drugs currently does not mean it is valueless, however.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just because we don't have that in our drug candidate doesn't
mean we won't be able to use it down the line,'' said EntreMed
attorney Johnson.

   There's an avalanche of mean-spirited pop allusions in
``Clerks,'' the new animated series adapted by Kevin Smith from his
own 1994 movie and his comic book. From ``Stand By Me'' and ``The
Phantom Menace'' to ``The People's Court,'' the show is a constant
flow of hipper-than-thou jabs at other pieces of entertainment and
at celebrities. Steven Spielberg, Pokemon, Gwyneth Paltrow, Matt
Damon, the NBA, they all take it square on the chin, which is a few
feet higher than they would probably take it on a similarly mocking
animated series called ``South Park.''
</P>
<P>
   But the endless ironic wit creates a big black hole in
``Clerks,'' and there's nothing left to fill the void but tedious
buddy characters doing their slacker thing in an unimaginatively
drawn New Jersey setting. Sure, ``The Simpsons'' loves to send up
pop culture, but it backs up all the timely goofs with great
characters and an original conception of the American family. It's
far from terminally cool. ``Clerks,'' on the other hand, gives us
only Randal, a video-store drone, and Dante, who mans the Quick
Stop convenience store. Neither one is engaging, to say the least,
as they bicker at each other and submit to the frustrations of
low-paying dead-end jobs. And, consistently, their racial and gay
jokes are as flat and half-realized as they are.
</P>
<P>
   The TV-ized ``Clerks'' lacks all the generational authenticity
and low-budget charm of the movie. Let's hope it ends up as the
butt of some joke about unnecessary entertainment rehashing in the
next razor-witted cartoon to come down the turnpike.

<P>
   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka _ Roshi, a 31-year-old businesswoman, recalls
driving along a highway some years ago and noticing two bodies
necklaced with flaming tires, burning at the side of the road.
</P>
<P>
   Accustomed to violence after years of ethnic warfare, she wove
her account matter-of-factly into the conversation. But minutes
later, she turned to a friend and remarked sadly:
</P>
<P>
   ``Can you imagine what our friends in England and America would
think of this? To us, that was just normal. What has happened to
us?''
</P>
<P>
   It is a question many Sri Lankans still are asking themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Hailed at midcentury as perhaps the Third World country most
likely to succeed, this island nation has instead sacrificed more
than 60,000 of its 19 million people, made refugees of nearly a
million, and forfeited its chances of serious economic development.
The cause: a 17-year war that exploded long-simmering tensions
between Sri Lanka's two main ethnic groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``People don't realize that this is one of the most active wars
in the world. A lot of people are dying here,'' said a foreign
diplomat. Citing a report last fall that 1,000 Russian soldiers had
died in Chechnya, the diplomat shook his head sadly: ``In my first
18 months here, there were three separate weeks where at least
1,000 Sri Lankan soldiers died in a single battle.''
</P>
<P>
   For a decade and a half, the battlefield advantage has swung
between the majority Sinhalese army and minority Tamil rebels, who
are fighting for an independent homeland. Now, after six weeks of
intensified fighting in the northern Jaffna peninsula, an estimated
5,000 to 7,000 rebels could be within striking distance of a
David-and-Goliath feat: recapturing Jaffna, the cultural center of
their would-be state, from as many as 40,000 soldiers defending the
peninsula. Last week, the rebels launched an assault in the
country's east, forcing the military to spread its soldiers even
thinner.
</P>
<P>
   The coming days may prove to be a turning point. But even if the
Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam win this battle, it would hardly
be the end of the war.
</P>
<P>
   Military analysts say neither side _ the 120,000-strong but
demoralized and desertion-plagued military; nor the minuscule, but
well-equipped and ruthless band of Tigers _ is strong enough to
wipe out the other. Analysts say a negotiated settlement is the
only hope, albeit an extremely faint one.
</P>
<P>
   The Sinhalese, who represent 74 percent of the country and
control the ruling party, its political opposition, and the
military, are often described as a majority with a minority
complex. Since independence in 1948, resentment has boiled against
the 18 percent Tamil minority _ who were better-educated and held
more powerful positions during British colonial times.
</P>
<P>
   Sinhalese was made the sole official language in 1956,
university and civil service admission was changed to favor
Sinhalese, and thousands of Tamils were killed in riots. But today,
years after discriminatory policies were reversed, many ordinary
Tamils still feel persecuted.
</P>
<P>
   Yet here in the capital, 200 miles south of the battleground,
from which journalists are barred, people of both the Sinhalese and
Tamil communities say they are tired of the war, and that it is the
government's vested interests that keep it going _ not the
sentiments of the people.
</P>
<P>
   Tales of incompetence and war profiteering among civil and
military officials were widely reported in local media before
strict censorship was imposed. Arms dealers interviewed allege that
amid the current weapons-buying spree, dealers are routinely paying
commissions to senior officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``The government has mismanaged this war from day one, and now
the war has become a business _ people are losing on purpose,''
said Sivasubramaniam, a development worker, who like many people
interviewed asked that his full name not be used.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, money is in part driving the war, from top to
bottom. Rural families encourage their young men to enlist; in the
face of 8 percent unemployment, the army is a job and the pay is
good. When a soldier dies, a handsome pension is paid to his
survivors, an insurance policy that discourages dissent.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, mainstream politicians, fearful of losing hard-line
Sinhalese votes in elections this August, are accused of dragging
their feet on an autonomy proposal for Tamils that might defuse the
war.
</P>
<P>
   Lack of information also feeds an odd acceptance of the body
count. The government recently imposed strict censorship, shut down
a critical newspaper, and arrested five people for
``rumor-mongering.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Censorship and self-censorship of the media has created a
situation where people don't know and don't want to know about the
war,'' said Paikiasothy Saravanumuttu, executive director of the
Center for Policy Alternatives, a local research institute. ``The
average Sri Lankan has seen more images of what war has done to
Bosnia, Kosovo, and East Timor than to Sri Lanka itself. With no
information coming out, there's nothing to galvanize people''
against war.
</P>
<P>
   People recall battles in which over 1,000 men died within 48 to
72 hours _ most recently last month _ and the sound of ambulances
carrying bodies from the front to Colombo hospitals was an unbroken
cry for days. Yet the stream of bodies didn't keep people from
work, school, or discos.
</P>
<P>
   ``The majority of deaths on both sides are rural youth. The
Colombo elite are still untouched,'' said Sugeeswara Senadhira,
associate director of the Regional Center for Strategic Studies.
</P>
<P>
   Colombo has not escaped occasional guerrilla suicide bombings,
which have claimed scores of lives and millions of dollars in
damage, but even they have become accepted in a way.
</P>
<P>
   ``As soon as a bomb goes off, you rush to school and pick up
your children and rush home, and for a few days you worry. . . .
But we have begun to learn to live with it, to think that we may
have to live with it for the rest of our lives,'' said Arjuna, 37,
a banker.

<P>
   A sense of doom has even pervaded everyday speech. It is
customary in Sinhalese to depart with the words, ``I will go and I
will return.'' But these days, some people simply say, ``I'm
leaving,'' because they don't know if they will come back.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than the numbness to violence, the biggest obstacle to
peace may be that neither side is willing to compromise on the
question of a Tamil homeland.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all have aspirations and expectations, but can we cater to
them all? No, certainly not,'' declared Thilak Karunaratne, general
secretary of the Sinhala Heritage Party, which rejects a homeland
or autonomy for Tamils, or even the idea that Tamils suffer
discrimination. ``We're all tired of this war, but it must go on.''
</P>
<P>
   Political scientist Jayadeva Uyangoda says the gap may be
widening between the two sides. ``Tamil nationalists and Sinhala
nationalists have reached a point where they don't even want to
recognize each other's legitimacy. . . . This will drag on for
years.''
</P>
<P>
   Whenever and however the war may end, it has left an indelible
scar.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was 14 when this war started, and it has become part of
us,'' said Roshi, as she sipped a gin and tonic at a colonial-era
rugby club filled with black-and-white photos, tatty leather
couches, and an air of genteel decline.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you hear of 60 people dying in a bomb blast, you think,
`That's sad,' but you go on. . . . Everyday I don't know if I'll
see my husband again. And you know, you learn to live with it.''

IN PACIFIC, ANOTHER ETHNIC CONFLICT WITH ROOTS IN IMPERIAL AGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES A. RADIN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Nationalistic racism can rear its head anywhere, as conflicts
from Europe to Africa to Asia have demonstrated time and again in
recent years. And the struggles are not limited to white-on-black
violence, as upheavals from the Balkans to the Middle East to the
current convulsions in the Fiji Islands illustrate.
</P>
<P>
   What is generally consistent about these episodes, as seen
clearly in Fiji, is that the trouble has roots in the Age of
Imperialism and that outbreaks occur when a group seems to be
gaining economic and political power at the expense of another
group that has been on the disputed turf for a longer period.
</P>
<P>
   That is precisely what is happening in the Republic of the Fiji
Islands, a southwest Pacific archipelago.
</P>
<P>
   To the extent that the country of 813,000 people, mostly
subsistence hunters and fishers, is known to the outside world at
all, it is as a scuba diver's paradise. But Fiji has been
struggling with simmering racial resentments since its emergence
from British colonial rule.
</P>
<P>
   Indigenous Fijians are descendants of Melanesians from southeast
Asia and Polynesians who migrated through Indonesia. For millennia,
these groups blended in the Fiji archipelago and evolved
distinctive customs, language, and religion.
</P>
<P>
   What the Fijians did not develop was a united country. Spread
across more than 300 islands, about 100 of which are inhabited,
they were ruled by local chiefs who continued to fight with one
another as first Dutch, then British, explorers came into view.
</P>
<P>
   In 1871, one powerful chief, Cakobau, was able to subdue the
clan warfare; in 1874, he asked the British to make Fiji a crown
colony as a strategy to avoid outside interference. This appeared
to work, as the British ruled through local chiefs and brought in
indentured servants from India to do grunt work on the sugarcane
plantations they established.
</P>
<P>
   Fiji remained a colony until, at its own request, it was granted
independence within the Commonwealth in 1970.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fiji's birthday present from the United Kingdom was an
enduring problem that the country is still trying to come to terms
with,'' said Michael Brown, a professor of international politics
at Georgetown University who specializes in the study of ethnic
conflict. ``The British completely changed the demographics in a
permanent way.''
</P>
<P>
   By the time of independence, there were, by many accounts, more
Fijians of Indian descent than of Melanesian heritage. Most of the
real estate was in the hands of the indigenous residents, but
modern business was the realm of ethnic Indians.
</P>
<P>
   A backlash against the Indians set in, similar to the Sinhalese
reaction against Tamils in Sri Lanka. It erupted in violence in
1987, when an election led to the first government in the young
country's history in which a majority of ministers were of Indian,
rather than Melanesian, descent.
</P>
<P>
   First a coup, then racial violence, occurred. Politicians forged
a compromise, but before they could put it in force, indigenous
nationalists staged a second coup. Fiji was ejected from the
Commonwealth, and the country was ostracized internationally until
civil government was restored. That was accomplished under a set of
arrangements that attempted to guarantee Indian Fijians their
rights while preserving a special sensitivity to the indigenous
Fijians.
</P>
<P>
   ``What that meant was never clear,'' said Robert Rotbert of
Harvard's Kennedy School of Government. While the nation settled a
bit after 1989-90, the underlying problem was not resolved.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, racial tensions rose as political leaders struggled
over a new constitution, but last year, after Fiji's first vote in
which seats in parliament were determined without regard to
ethnicity, there was hope that a corner had been turned.
</P>
<P>
   ``People hope that (Mahendra) Chaudhry's election (as prime
minister) meant indigenous Fijians had come to terms with the
ethnic realities,'' Brown said, ``and accepted power sharing.''
</P>
<P>
   Those hopes have died in recent weeks.

REVISITING TREATMENT OF WOMEN IN THE BIBLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL PAULSON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Of all the women in the Bible, few have a poorer image than Eve,
the first woman mentioned in the Old Testament. Through the
centuries, popular culture, whether literature or art, has depicted
the Eve of Genesis as a sinner who seduces Adam and precipitates
the fall of man.
</P>
<P>
   But a careful reading of Scripture in the original Hebrew _ not
in an English translation _ clearly debunks these views, according
to Carol Meyers, a professor of archeology and biblical studies at
Duke University.
</P>
<P>
   And Eve, Meyers asserts, is not the only woman in the Bible who
has not received fair treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Meyers is part of a growing body of scholars whose intense study
of the Bible is yielding new information about female figures in
Scripture, challenging conceptions _ and, in some cases,
misconceptions _ about women that have been used to justify biases.
</P>
<P>
   Now Meyers has brought together the work of about 80 scholars to
produce an unprecedented reference book, ``Women in Scripture.''
</P>
<P>
   Divided into three sections, the volume provides entries on more
than 200 named women in the Bible, more than 600 entries on unnamed
women, and 49 articles about nonhuman females, including feminine
deities.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there is a lot of distortion and misunderstanding
about biblical figures, both men and women, as a result of 2,000
years of biblical interpretation,'' said Meyers, who served as
general editor of the reference book.
</P>
<P>
   ``This interpretation, when it comes to women, has almost always
been done by men,'' she said. ``I'm not sure it's meant to be evil,
but there are biases and I'm hopeful the book will serve to correct
some biases and misconceptions.''
</P>
<P>
   Meyers and the rest of the book's contributors are quick to
point out that they did not set out to produce a polemical volume,
but rather a work based on thorough academic research.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, however, Meyers said the book is meant to be
accessible to general interest readers and not simply to scholars.
And, indeed, a perusal of the book offers articles easy to
understand even if you don't have a background in biblical
scholarship.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want this to be a coffee-table book,'' Meyers said.
``We want people to use it, whether it be pastors preparing Sunday
sermons, women in Bible study groups, or students in a college
course _ anyone who is interested in finding out about women in the
Bible and what scholars think about them.''
</P>
<P>
   Meyers, who has written extensively on Eve, contributed a piece
on Eve that attempts to refute popular interpretations of the first
woman of the Bible.
</P>
<P>
   While Eve is commonly associated with sin, Meyers points out
that she is not called a sinner and that, in fact, the word sin
does not appear in the Old Testament until the story of Cain and
Abel.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Eve does not seduce Adam with an apple. The fruit is not
an apple and Eve simply gives it to Adam, Meyers notes. And,
contrary to popular belief, God does not curse Eve; God curses the
serpent and the ground underneath it. Finally, the Eden story is
often described as the fall of man, but this is a Christian
application of views put forth by Plato.
</P>
<P>
   And, Meyers writes, ``The Hebrew word `adam' can indeed mean a
male and even be the proper name Adam; but it can also be a generic
term for a mortal or a human being.''

LET TAXPAYERS SHARE WEALTH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DERRICK Z. JACKSON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Since two can play pie-in-the-sky, taxpayers should not be shy
about what they get for their $275 million that the Red Sox want
for a new $627 million Fenway Park. Forget the nickel and dime
negotiating over parking garage revenues. Forget the hopeless
scheming for more leisure taxes. Forget being lulled into sympathy
by the fact that the Sox give money to charity.
</P>
<P>
   Taxpayers should no longer live on the edge of the stadium,
isolated in the bleachers and banished behind the Green Monster,
waiting for a home run to drop into their hands like the lottery.
It is time to get into the skybox. If the Red Sox want the public
to pay for 43 percent of the stadium project, fine. Build the park.
Build it now. Time is running out on the dream of seeing Pedro
Martinez strike out Mark McGwire in the ninth inning of the seventh
game of the 2005 World Series.
</P>
<P>
   There is just one catch. If the taxpayers build 43 percent of
the park, they should get 43 percent of the ownership of the team.
</P>
<P>
   As I said, taxpayers should not be shy. Besides, all they would
be doing is forcing Red Sox CEO John Harrington to live up to _ or
eat _ his own grandiose words.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent Globe op-ed piece, Harrington referred to stadium
subsidies as an ``investment'' no less than five times. He said he
wants to maintain the ``extraordinary relationship with this
community.'' Since it has been quite ordinary for cities to lose
$200 million and $300 million on stadiums, nothing could be more
extraordinary than to make this ``investment'' the real thing.
</P>
<P>
   Public ownership of teams has been suggested by everyday fans as
well as people who study stadium subsidies for a living. Jay
Weiner, author of ``Stadium Games,'' a new book on stadium funding,
said, ``Citizens who help to fund a ballpark that boosts the
owners' wealth must share in the increased value of the teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``How? When teams are sold to new owners, the city must get a
piece of that windfall. That can help to pay off the costs of the
stadium. Or, in exchange for funding the new Fenway, the city must
get an equity stake in the team. Owners always talk of
partnerships. Here's their chance to put their money where their
mouth is.''
</P>
<P>
   Since 43 percent is not a controlling interest, the Sox would
still get to run the team the way they want, which lately is pretty
good. But the taxpayers, who have up to now been asked by these
robber barons to mine the baseball diamonds, no longer need be left
behind in cold, dark caves of debt. They can share in the gleaming
profits at the jewelry store.
</P>
<P>
   The skyrocketing value of teams with new stadiums should end any
more taxpayer subsidies that do not involve an equity stake.
According to a new Forbes Magazine survey, the value of the
Cleveland Indians has gone up from $45 million in 1986 to $364
million today. The Baltimore Orioles has gone up from $70 million
in 1989 to $347 million. The Texas Rangers have risen from $123
million in 1991 to $294 million.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta Braves have soared in value from $83 million in 1991
to $388 million. The Seattle Mariners have jumped from $79 million
in 1991 to $290 million, the Detroit Tigers from $85 million to
$200 million, the Houston Astros from $95 million in 1991 to $280
million, the Colorado Rockies from $110 million in 1994 to $305
million, and the Arizona Diamondbacks from $130 million in 1995 to
$268 million.
</P>
<P>
   The San Francisco Giants, despite being forced to finance their
new ballpark privately, have risen in value from $99 million to
$237 million. The only team not to see exponential gains was the
Chicago White Sox, which built the ugliest of the new stadiums and
has been playing to mediocre crowds.
</P>
<P>
   How taxpayers are paid back is certainly negotiable, whether in
annual payments to state and city coffers or in a massive lump
whenever the team is sold. But let no baseball owner say it cannot
happen. The value of teams increases so immensely with new stadiums
and their skyboxes that the only roadblock against a true
``public-private partnership'' is owner greed.
</P>
<P>
   Harrington whined, ``to play here for another 100 years we do
need the kind of public investments'' that are ``justified by the
return to the state and the city in hard economic benefits.'' Since
studies show there are no such returns when the public pays $200
million and $300 million for stadiums, taxpayers should demand the
hardest economic benefit possible.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox were worth $160 million in 1991. Even without a new
Fenway, they are now worth $284 million, the 10th most valuable
franchise out of baseball's 30 teams, according to Forbes.
</P>
<P>
   The team will be worth so much more with a new Fenway, taxpayers
should call the team's bluff as to whose ``investment'' this is and
who benefits most from this ``extraordinary relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   Build the stadium. Build it now. But if the taxpayers pay 43
percent of the cost of building the mine, it gets 43 percent of the
diamonds. Otherwise, all the taxpayers get is the shaft.

   HOW MANY BOTTLES OF OIL ON THE WALL? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Paula Wolfert, author of ``The Cooking of the Eastern
Mediterranean,'' among other titles, says cooks should use olive
oil from the country of the cuisine they are cooking. Making
moussaka? Use Greek olive oil. Making paella? Use Spanish olive
oil.
</P>
<P>
   Faith Willinger, author of ``Red, White &AMP; Greens: The Italian
Way With Vegetables,'' says American cooks have it all wrong. She
uses extra-virgin olive oil in all her cooking. To do otherwise,
she says, is akin to frying a fish in margarine and then laying a
pat of butter on top.
</P>
<P>
   The home cook should have a couple kinds of olive oils in the
pantry but, culinary divas aside, a battalion of different bottles
is not necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Have a good bottle of extra-virgin on hand for drizzling on
summer ripe tomatoes or for jazzing up pieces of toast and calling
them bruscetta. A pleasing-to-your-palate, medium-priced olive oil
is fine for everyday cooking. And if you'd like to adjust your
baking to use olive oil as a replacement for more conventional
fats, buy a light olive oil.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, don't buy more oil than you'll use in a reasonable
length of time. Those huge tins of oil look great, but if you don't
use much oil, it can turn rancid before you see the bottom of the
tin.
</P>
<P>
   Store olive oil out of sunlight and away from the stove or any
other heat for the longest shelf life. Refrigerating olive oil will
dull the flavor. However, if you've made a marinade or dip and want
to save it before serving, refrigerate and then let it come to room
temperature before serving.

   WHAT PRICE FLAVOR? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A classic Turkish dish is Imam Bayildi, or ``the imam fainted.''
</P>
<P>
   One story goes that the eggplant/tomato/onion dish got its name
because it was a favorite of a Muslim cleric. When he found out how
much olive oil was used in the recipe, he swooned from the excess
of the expense.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   BETCHA DIDN'T KNOW &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Olive trees have been around since 3000 B.C.
</P>
<P>
   Each tree lives between 300 and 600 years. When an olive tree
dies, new shoots emerge around the base and grow into a new tree.
</P>
<P>
   The average tree yields 40 pounds of olives a year. It takes 10
pounds of olives to make 1 liter of olive oil.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   MARINATE YOURSELF
</P>
<P>
   After you get finished putting olive oil on your salad at the
picnic, rub some on your skin. Virgin olive oil, applied to the
skin after sunbathing, could protect against skin cancer, ``New
Scientist'' magazine reports. According to researchers at Kobe
University School of Medicine in Japan, a study concluded that the
oil slowed tumor growth in mice used in cancer experiments.

FEEL A PRESSING NEED FOR A SPECIAL OIL? CHANCES ARE THAT YOU CAN

<TEXT>
<P>
   Time was when the adventuresome cook took off to the
supermarket, ``Mastering the Art of French Cooking'' in hand, and
scoured the shelves looking for olive oil.
</P>
<P>
   Except in cities with a sizable Italian or Greek population, the
cook of yesteryear most likely had one lone brand to choose from.
The conical bottle of Pompeiian Olive Oil was the one that went
home to become an ingredient in the Julia Child production of the
week.
</P>
<P>
   But now, thanks to world travel and new nutritional information,
the most ancient of oils is hot again.
</P>
<P>
   Americans now know that there's more to Italian food than pizza.
There's pesto and bagna cauda, the obnoxiously named ``Italian
butter'' at Macaroni Grill. And we also now know that there's a
world of food to the east of Italy:
</P>
<P>
   Greek salad and Lebanese tabbouleh and Turkish meze spreads.
</P>
<P>
   And just as we were tucking into these food finds in the
culinary explosion of the 1980s, the American Heart Association
announced that olive oil was _ welcome news for once _ good for us.
A monounsaturated oil, olive oil beat out the grain- and seed-based
oils Americans had been downing for 100 years.
</P>
<P>
   In good American free-enterprise tradition, the grocery shelves
got loaded with different brands and variations of olive oil. We
got virgin olive oil, we got extra-virgin olive oil, cold-pressed
olive oil, flavored olive oil and lite olive oil. We got olive oil
spray. And organic olive oil.
</P>
<P>
   And now, it appears we're about to get even more.
</P>
<P>
   ``The olive oil industry in California is where the California
wine industry was 20 years ago,'' says Bruce Beauchamp, owner of
Capay Olives in Orland, Calif. Olive growers, Beauchamp says, are
turning to making ``boutique'' oils that sell for a premium.
Beauchamp himself is working with making kalamata olive oil, saying
the flavor is ``like kissing God.''
</P>
<P>
   And this summer, American consumers will experience another oil
onslaught from Italy. Carapelli, that country's leading
extra-virgin olive oil producer, is bringing four varieties of oil
to a supermarket near you. Looks like it's time to make more room
on the shelf.

   Heat oil in small saucepan over medium heat until very hot but
not boiling. Drop in 1 red pepper flake; if it skips to the surface
of the oil and bubbles, the oil is the correct temperature. If the
pepper turns brown or black, oil is too hot and you will have to
let it cool awhile. If pepper sinks and doesn't bubble, oil is not
hot enough. Keep heating and testing until you've got it right.
When oil is correct temperature, remove from heat and add remaining
pepper flakes. They will sizzle and bubble on surface of oil a few
minutes. When action subsides and oil turns a pale orange color,
add lemon juice, garlic and ground pepper. Let cool completely.

JUST A TAD SHORT OF WONDERFUL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By PAUL BOURGEOIS 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Zambezi is a solid, well-made but undistinguished beer that
falls firmly into that great class of beers that are merely good.
</P>
<P>
   It is by no means bad, but it is not wonderful either.
</P>
<P>
   Zambezi produces a very nice, effervescent head, if that means
anything to you, but it subsides quickly.
</P>
<P>
   We found Zambezi a tad astringent, almost citrusy. Still, it had
a freshness about it, and a pleasant gold color, but not much depth
of flavor.
</P>
<P>
   The finish was a little bitter, but should you find yourself
tromping through the African bush in the dead of summer, do not
turn Zambezi down.
</P>
<P>
   It was refreshing but without the complex layers of taste and
aroma that we crave. Zambezi is a good beer, but for the money you
can do better, despite its fine and educational label.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very enlightening beer,'' said The Norm, a
self-styled know-it-all who lives in my back yard, but who insists
that he is homeless.
</P>
<P>
   If it weren't for beer labels, The Norm wouldn't read at all,
but he's determined to get on ``Who Wants To Be a Millionaire.''
</P>
<P>
   He had planned to strike it rich as an inventor, but he said the
military seems uninterested in a helicopter that only flies upside
down.
</P>
<P>
   So now he's studying for his big break with Regis, and he found
the Zambezi label helpful.
</P>
<P>
   On it we learned that the beer is named for the Zambezi River,
the ``greatest river in Africa''; and that the river cascades over
Victoria Falls, which ``is one of the seven wonders of the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, we weren't sure about this wonder business, so we checked
and it seems there are several sets of wonders. There's the ancient
wonders; the modern wonders; the Middle Age wonders; the natural
wonders, which includes Victoria Falls; and the Forgotten Wonders,
which are wonders that failed to make any other ``wonder'' list.
</P>
<P>
   But none makes any mention of beer, so here are our Seven
Wonders of the Beer World.
</P>
<P>
   1) Lite beer. The big wonder is why? It isn't real beer, and
``lite'' isn't a real word.
</P>
<P>
   2) Fruit-flavored beer. Again, we wonder. If you have to eat
fruit, eat a fried pie and wash it down with a Schlitz, but don't
mix them first. It's gross.
</P>
<P>
   3) Genuine draft in a bottle? Listen up, people, if it's in a
bottle, it isn't draft.
</P>
<P>
   4) Coors. A waste of good water.
</P>
<P>
   5) Coors Lite. It IS water, only with a metallic taste.
</P>
<P>
   6) Designer beer. Designers are guys who don't like women and
make them wear goofy clothes that nobody, least of all a beer
drinker, would buy. Brewers make beer, not designers.
</P>
<P>
   7) Nonalcoholic beer. This is a tough one. We are sympathetic to
those who for whatever reason can't drink real beer. But the idea
of calling this stuff beer is like yanking the engine from an F-16
and calling it a plane. This just don't fly.

THE NEW URBAN LANGUAGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARTIN F. NOLAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ A word is passing out of the American language.
``Gentrification'' once described a lifestyle and complaints about
it. Its linguistic replacement is ``housing crisis,'' with adverbs
and adjectives trailing: ``ridiculously high rents'' and ``amazing
home prices'' in ``a crazy market.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Gentrification'' blossomed in the Reagan era, after recession
and inflation in the 1970s had depressed the urban housing market.
The American Heritage Dictionary in 1982 called it the
``restoration of deteriorated urban property, especially in
working-class neighborhoods, by the middle and upper classes.'' The
Oxford American Dictionary added a political spin: ``movement of
middle class families into urban areas, causing property values to
increase and having secondary effect of driving out poorer
families.''
</P>
<P>
   Poorer families suffered, especially from federal cutbacks in
housing in the Reagan era, but early gentrifiers benefited and
accumulated political clout. The scene in this city's neighborhoods
is familiar elsewhere. An organic-food store has replaced the
bodega, the old tavern is now a brewpub, and the luncheonette has
become a coffee parlor. OK, perfect, nobody else come unless you
want to be branded an Outsider and a Gentrifier.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one in the '60s or '70s worried about gentrification,''
recalls Barney Frank, who has grappled with housing problems in the
Massachusetts Legislature and now in Congress. ``We have to deal
with expiring Section 8s,'' a federal program aiding renters. ``You
can not prevent gentrification, nor should you. What you can do is
to offset the consequences. It's the same overall with capitalism
and globalism. It's what Franklin Roosevelt would do: Set aside
some money, slow things down, yes, but not antigentrification.''
</P>
<P>
   A recent study showed that 40 percent of San Francisco renters
pay more than a third of their incomes on housing and that 20
percent pay half of their salaries. With job growth outpacing
housing starts, the average one-bedroom apartment now rents for
$2,000 monthly.
</P>
<P>
   The board of education proposes a teachers' apartment complex
near the planned Dianne Feinstein Elementary School. The city also
hopes to build high-rise clusters near transit stations. More
federal and state money is needed, but a severe political problem
is local. Even though the city has been zoned for high-rise housing
in some areas for decades, neighborhood opposition stalls projects
for years. And who are the fiercest opponents? Not the families
whose roots go back generations, but those who hopped aboard the
vessel of prosperity in the '80s and '90s and now propose pulling
up the ladder.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gentrification'' has faded as a menace because early
gentrifiers won and have mostly prospered, these several ``greed
decades'' later. Many now own instead of rent, but still cherish
the anti-Reagan, anticapitalist stance of chic urban pioneers. They
oppose ``luxury housing for the rich,'' even though such housing
relieves the gentrifying pressure on rental housing for others. The
early gentrifiers do not believe that a rising tide lifts all
boats. Nor do they believe in the law of supply and demand.
</P>
<P>
   They were once called yuppies (young urban professionals), a
name they still don't like. They swiftly adapted to another
acronym, NIMBY: ``Not In My Back Yard,'' they say in this city and
others. They say no to new housing, to a new ballpark, to anything
new, though they're fairly new themselves.
</P>
<P>
   They chatter about a ``housing crisis,'' they no longer
experience themselves. They combine liberal views on social and
sexual issues with a robustly conservative defense of the economic
status quo. They intimidate politicians with NIMBY manifestos and
storm City Hall to protest outsiders who might lengthen their latte
line. The early gentrifiers have gone beyond NIMBY and gone
BANANAs: ``Build Absolutely Nothing Anywhere Near Anything,''
simple as that.

 &HT;    How to survive 'Survivor'
 &HT;    By Kevin D. Thompson
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   They slept dangerously close to poisonous snakes. Roasted rats
for dinner. Hiked for hours along treacherous, bug-infested trails.
</P>
<P>
   Is this any way to win a million bucks?
</P>
<P>
   It was for 16 adventure-seeking _ some might argue insane _
castaways on Survivor, CBS' bizarre reality series/game show
premiering tonight (8 p.m., WPEC-Channel 12). Combining elements of
The Real World, Gilligan's Island and Who Wants To Be A
Millionaire, Survivor is TV's latest ratings stunt in which people
are more than willing to humiliate themselves in front of a
prime-time audience for the sake of money and 15 fleeting minutes
of fame.
</P>
<P>
   And you thought it couldn't get any worse than Rick and Darva.
</P>
<P>
   This Truman Show meets Lord of The Flies one-hour series, hosted
by Jeff Probst (VH1's Rock and Roll Jeopardy!), is scheduled to air
for 13 weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Inspired by a similar Swedish game, the Survivor concept is
relatively simple. Sixteen people _ ranging in age from 22 to 72 _
are dropped on a tropical Malaysian island for 39 days with minimal
supplies. Actually, they're forced to jump off a ship and swim
about a mile to their temporary home. Among the eight men and eight
women are a housewife, a neurologist, a biochemist, a river guide,
a musician and a retired Navy SEAL. Round-the-clock camera crews
hidden behind coral reefs and palm fronds follow their every move _
from trekking two hours for water to participating in a live
worm-eating competition.
</P>
<P>
   In this modern-day Robinson Crusoe adventure, the castaways are
forced to work together to build shelter (makeshift huts) and hunt
for food (they made bamboo spears to catch fish). The contestants
also gather every third day to compete in various games (diving
contests, treasure hunts) for such luxury items as chocolate bars
and flashlights. But every third night, the castaways hold a secret
ballot to boot one of the contestants _ probably the weak link or
loudest snorer _ off the island. When two survivors are left, a
panel of seven expelled participants will choose the $1 million
winner. The winner's identity won't be revealed until the final
episode _ if no one blabs before then, that is.
</P>
<P>
   So, while teamwork and cooperation are important, so is the
ability to be a deceitful back-stabber.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the best and worst of office politics,'' notes Mark
Burnett, Survivor's executive producer. ``Very few people rise up
in organizations by being 100 percent on the straight-and-narrow
path. I gained enormous respect for some people and their
duplicity. At times this was an interesting mirror on life.''
</P>
<P>
   Burnett says he was surprised at how competitive the contestants
became. After one period of nonstop rain, for example, the
survivors were extremely hungry. So, Burnett gave them a map to
find fruit. ``They were offended,'' he recalls. ``They said, `Screw
you! Keep your map!' Most of these people didn't want to talk about
the money. They said they would've paid us for the experience.''
</P>
<P>
   But there were concerns. A few years ago, a contestant who
played the game in Sweden committed suicide a month after getting
kicked off the island. To keep that from happening on CBS' version,
two psychologists were hired to counsel exiled contestants. But
they didn't have much to do, Burnett says. ``It was boring for them
because we chose the people so well,'' he says. ``The psychologist
was like, `Can I have a beer?'''
</P>
<P>
   So, was there any hanky-panky on the island? After all, there
were manly studs and young college girls romping around the jungle
in skimpy bikinis. Burnett says he's sure one male and female
hooked up. ``But that wasn't a big factor in the show,'' he
explains.
</P>
<P>
   As expected, there were several tense moments. Some of the
castaways genuinely disliked each other. But most of those moments
occurred when someone was voted off the island. ``For most human
beings, not being liked is the most painful thing they can
endure,'' Burnett says. ``But most of them took it on the chin and
said, `OK, it was just a game.'''
</P>
<P>
   And there was a lot of interest in the game. CBS says it
received more than 6,000 applications and videotapes _ many from
Florida. In one video, a Floridian was seen shimmying up a palm
tree to show off skills he thought would be helpful on a tropical
island.
</P>
<P>
   Burnett had one major criteria for a Survivor contestant. ``We
didn't want to choose the kind of people you might see on The Jerry
Springer Show,'' says Burnett, who also produces Discovery
Channel's Eco Challenge. ``We went out of our way to choose people
who were very balanced.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Les Moonves, CBS' president and CEO, got in on the
five-month casting process when the field was narrowed to 50
Survivor wannabes. ``It was more interesting that any pilot we've
ever done,'' Moonves points out. ``Seeing these 50 people and
trying to put together a puzzle ... was fascinating.''
</P>
<P>
   But why did CBS want to do it? Well, that's easier than Regis'
first question.
</P>
<P>
   Survivor could help older-skewing CBS attract younger viewers.
Moonves adds that networks can experiment more in the summer, when
the ratings stakes aren't as high. ``This show will call attention
to the fact that CBS is not closed for the summer,'' Moonves says.
``There's a fascination with seeing average guys in unusual
circumstances.''
</P>
<P>
   We are, it appears, a nation full of thrill-loving voyeurs.
Everything from The Real World to Internet sites with 24-hour
cameras are extremely popular.
</P>
<P>
   ``Network TV has been looking for the next good idea for a long
time,'' says Robert Thompson, director of Syracuse University's
Center for the Study of Popular Television. ``Sleazy as it may be,
this may be the next big idea. TV and voyeurism were bound to
unite. The formula is one that clearly works. TV can let us be
peeping Toms without going to someone's window.''
</P>
<P>
   Thompson believes we'll see more reality specials because they
are cheap, low-risk ventures. In fact, Big Brother, a CBS series in
which 10 people who have never met live in a house under total
surveillance, debuts in July. CBS says it's already preparing
another Survivor series if this one does well. (Such locations as
Tibet, the Australian Outback and Africa are being considered.)
Even stodgy PBS is joining the fray with The 1900 House, in which a
family spends three months in a house without modern-day
technology.
</P>
<P>
   Somewhere, 1984 author George Orwell must be smiling.
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of him is saying, `I told you so,''' Thompson says. ``But
part of him was all wrong. This is not a state apparatus that's
being imposed upon us to keep us docile. We're doing it to
ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   kevinthompson(at)pbpost.com
</P>
<P>
   OPTIONAL
</P>
<P>
   The rules of the game:
</P>
<P>
   Sixteen castaways are marooned on a tropical island in the South
China Sea for 39 days and divided into two teams.
</P>
<P>
   With minimal supplies, the contestants work together to build
shelter and hunt for food. On the last day of each three-day cycle,
the castaways form a tribal council. At the meeting, each person
casts a secret ballot to boot one fellow castaway off the island.
</P>
<P>
   When only two survivors remain, the seven most-recently
eliminated contestants return to decide who the final survivor will
be.
</P>
<P>
   The winner takes home $1 million. Consolation cash prizes will
be awarded to the other castaways based on their order of
elimination. Those prizes will range from about $2,500 for the
first castaway ousted from the island to about $100,000 for the
runner-up to the final survivor.

 &HT;    Eds: Runs with SURVIVOR-LEDE
 &HT;    Rats! What are we going to eat here?
 &HT;    By Kevin D. Thompson
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Imagine eating a fried rat. Colleen Haskell says it's not that
bad.
</P>
<P>
   As one of the 16 Survivor contestants left on a tropical
Malaysian island for 39 days, it wasn't like the 23-year-old Miami
Beach resident had many fancy dining options.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were so many rats and we had nothing else to eat,''
shrugs the bubbly Haskell. ``We were killing them left and right,
after a while, we said, `What are we going to do with all of these
dead rats?' So someone just threw them in the fire. ... I took a
leg and said, `Whatever.'''
</P>
<P>
   Haskell, who admits she's a bit ``spacey,'' answered an open
casting call last year in Miami to become a Survivor contestant.
The Bethesda, Md., native says she was shocked after being
selected. Her parents, quite naturally, thought she was nuts.
``They said, `This isn't in the parental handbook,''' says Haskell,
giggling like a high schooler. ``They still don't know what to do.
My mom's a wreck.''
</P>
<P>
   While riding on the plane for the 12,000-mile trip to the remote
island in the South China Sea, even Haskell wondered if she did the
right thing. ``We (the contestants) weren't allowed to talk to each
other, but I was looking at this person and what they were wearing
and I was thinking, `What am I going to do living with this person?
Why did I sign on the dotted line?''' she recalls.
</P>
<P>
   Haskell, a student at Miami Ad School, calls her Survivor
experience ``amazing.'' Spending more than a month with 15 other
strangers in less than ideal conditions leaves a lot of time for
serious introspection. ``I learned a lot about myself,'' says
Haskell, who hopes to land a job in creative advertising. ``Being
23, everyone my age goes through insecurities about what they're
doing and where they're headed, but this experience put everything
in an isolated period. I had to set a goal and achieve it.... that
was in my face every day.''
</P>
<P>
   And the toughest part?
</P>
<P>
   Why, swimming across a muddy lagoon, of course.
</P>
<P>
   ``The water was thicker than mud,'' she recalls. ``It was awful,
awful, awful.''
</P>
<P>
   Haskell also wasn't too happy about the frigid night
temperatures, constant bug bites and lack of flavor in food.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't realize how important flavor is in food,'' Haskell
says. ``Sometimes it tasted like the most disgusting thing you ever
ate.''
</P>
<P>
   The contestants, Haskell says, often got antsy during the many
down times when there wasn't anything to do. ``You had nothing else
to do but wonder if something was wrong with you,'' she says.
``Someone would go, `This cut is really infected' and everyone
goes, like, `Yeah.' I think everyone thought they were going to die
at some point.''
</P>
<P>
   So, would she do it again?
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, it was fun,'' Haskell says excitedly. ``It was like I
went to summer camp and now I'm on TV.''
</P>
<P>
   On TV ... eating rats.

   WHAT I THINK I DID &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A Season of Survival in Two Acts &QL;
</P>
<P>
   By Larry Woiwode &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Basic Books, 309 pp., $25 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Larry Woiwode published his first novel, ``What I Did, I
Think,'' 31 years ago. All his subsequent fiction has, to various
extents, been autobiographical, reflecting the times, places, and
memories of his life. So was his first nonfiction book, a
meditation on the Book of Acts. Now he has turned his attention to
the genre of memoir, and he's called the first of three projected
volumes ``What I Think I Did.'' It closes with the publication of
``What I Did, I Think'' when he was 28; the closing words are ``I'm
launched.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What I Think I Did'' is a book about the development of a
writer, what has to happen before a launching can happen. It is
also necessarily a book about the development of a person. To
present this, Woiwode develops an unusual form, based at first on
juxtapositions rather than on strict chronology _ this form is the
result of his effort to get ``beneath the self-consciousness of
self.''
</P>
<P>
   He opens in the middle of the worst winter in the recorded
history of North Dakota, where he lives, in 1996-97. Much of the
book records his trials during a particularly severe storm, when
keeping a complicated wood-burning furnace going becomes a matter
of life or death when there is no electricity and almost no
firewood left; Woiwode is particularly wonderful on the bond
between himself and his son, Joseph _ and indeed on all human
relationships (a neighbor and friend, he writes, ``takes my wife's
hand, and I think that being a saint is not predicated on who you
are but what you do before anybody asks'').
</P>
<P>
   In the midst of the struggle, which occupies most of the first
third of the book, elements of autobiography appear and then swirl
away _ childhood, student days at the University of Illinois, early
years in New York, experiences with his own family. The brief
central section of the book is meditative, gathering up threads and
spinning new ones out. In the third section, the storm breaks up
and subsides and becomes more important as metaphor than as
reality, and the autobiographical elements come to predominate.
There are longer passages about his college days and about his
mentors, the most important of whom was the novelist William
Maxwell, who was also the fiction editor of The New Yorker, where
Woiwode's first stories appeared.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the New Yorker crowd make their appearance, including
the editor, William Shawn. Woiwode is uncomfortable, feeling badly
dressed. Maxwell reassures him, ``Don't let it concern you. All he
saw was your eyes.'' The formidable Janet Flanner (``Genet'')
erupts into the text later, in a characteristic example of the
echoes with which the book resounds: ``A gray-haired woman with the
portly build of Colette in her grand dame phase came up in an
imperious way right to my face and cocked her head and stared into
me as Mr. Shawn once did, and said, `I had to see for myself. Thank
you.' '' Woiwode also gives us telling glimpses of several other
literary figures _ Robert Frost, Jorge Luis Borges, Eudora Welty,
John Updike, Norman Mailer, Truman Capote, Robert Lowell _ and
there's an endearing memoir of a close friendship with an unknown
teen-age New York actor named Robert De Niro. ``It's difficult
talking to him because any question moves him to another quadrant
of character, if not a new character altogether.''
</P>
<P>
   But most of the book is about the agony and the bliss of
writing, of learning to listen and of figuring out how to use what
you've heard and remembered. Often Maxwell imparts sage advice
(``No character is complete without the writer's unconditional
love''). Woiwode also shares something of his own experience: ``A
story continues to reveal itself and to grow as a child does, even
after the child becomes an adult.''
</P>
<P>
   There are those who feel that Woiwode has not fulfilled his
early promise. His reputation has perhaps suffered because he
writes about themes significantly absent from much serious
contemporary writing _ love, family, place, all seen from a
religious point of view, sub specie aeternitatis. But he continues
to be a writer who can not only dazzle (``surfaces edged with a
crystalline light that shimmers everywhere form the snow-layered
landscape like fire on foil,'' he writes in his fourth sentence)
but illuminate. His value lies in the way he has for 30 years
doggedly gone on and written the difficult books he had to write
(``I can't set down a sentence if I don't know it's true, because
I'm the one responsible for it'') rather than the ones others would
have preferred him to write. There is something organic, whole and
necessary about his work that does, in his words, ``lodge in a
consciousness like a coat on a hook.'' Readers grateful for the
life-enhancing experience of Woiwode's great novels ``Beyond the
Bedroom Wall'' and ``Born Brothers'' will receive ``What I Think I
Did'' as another manifestation of a special grace, and will want,
with Janet Flanner, to say, ``Thank you'' for what he has enabled
us to see for ourselves.

 HARPER'S MARKS 150th; A CASUALTY OF WAR  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DON AUCOIN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   To mark the 150th anniversary of  &UR; Harper's,  &LR; Lewis Lapham &AMP; Co.
have thrown a high-minded party in print that reminds us how
indispensable the magazine is.
</P>
<P>
   Mining gems from the 19th century, the June issue offers, among
many other things, Mark Twain's hilarious spoof of the full
disclosure required of presidential candidates (which could be
written today, if only there were a Twain around to write it); a
surprising list of words that first appeared in 1850 (among them
buddy, employee, heartbeat, pornographer, sonny, wavelength); and a
stirring letter to the London Times from Frederick Douglass,
thanking the newspaper for editorializing against a racist assault
on him.
</P>
<P>
   Back here in the present, Tom Wolfe weighs in with another
scathingly stylish essay upbraiding the lefty intelligentsia. The
white-suited one evidently has no intention of mellowing as he
approaches his 70th year (of Susan Sontag, Wolfe writes that she
``spent her life signing up for protest meetings and lumbering to
the podium, encumbered by her prose style, which had a handicapped
parking sticker valid at Partisan Review'').
</P>
<P>
   But the issue's high point for this reader is the series of
short stories and essays written by present-day authors from the
vantage of 1850; more than a nod to the past, this amounts to a
genuinely searching look. The best of them is ``P.T. Barnum and My
Great-Great-Granddad's Slaves,'' in which Allan Gurganus turns his
ancestor's trip to see a Barnum roadshow (with family slaves in
tow) into a lyrical meditation on slavery. Who were the real
freaks, Gurganus asks, Barnum's bearded ladies and the other
hapless ``curiosities,'' or the people who actually felt they had
the right to own other human beings?
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Given the facile contempt so much of the public feels for ``the
media,'' it's worth noting that 34 journalists were killed doing
their jobs in 1999. One of them was Myles Tierney, a 34-year-old
producer for Associated Press Television who made a career of
bringing TV cameras into places others feared to go, right up to
the day he was machine-gunned by a rebel in Freetown, the capital
of Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
   Tierney's brief life is the subject of an excellent piece by his
colleague and sometime lover, Dianna Cahn, in the June  &UR; Brill's
Content. &LR;  This thoughtful, self-questioning account of the hazards
faced by foreign correspondents makes clear the price some
journalists are willing to pay in order to tell a story they think
the world needs to know _ even if, in the case of the civil war
that tore apart Sierra Leone and caused unspeakable suffering for
civilians, much of the world seemed indifferent.
</P>
<P>
   But the risk-loving, fearless Tierney seemed born for a war zone
and would cross enemy lines if that's what it took. ``He liked
covering wars and was good at it; he thrived on the commotion, the
negotiation, the adrenaline,'' writes Cahn. ``For him it was always
a chase, a story that needed to be told.''
</P>
<P>
   For Cahn herself, Tierney's death brought not just grief but a
deeper understanding of the strange kinship between war
correspondents and the desperate people they cover. She learned
that ``we go into these places knowing we can leave any time we
choose. We have lives outside. But in death, a very real part of
war, the difference is gone.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Salon columnist Cintra Wilson rails entertainingly _ but, of
course, futilely _ against the American obsession with fame in
 &UR; Utne Reader. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ``Fame is a perverse deformity, an ego swelling as ludicrous as
an extra sex organ . . ., '' Wilson writes. And: ``Celebrity is a
virulent killer of fundamental human values, and the only way to
control it is to quit believing in it.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilson's essential point is that the cult of fame and celebrity
is a pernicious trap for us, the gawkers, since it keeps us from
Getting a Life. She might be right, and it's certainly refreshing _
with the magazine stands clotted with odes to celebrity worship _
to see someone turning a rhetorical blowtorch on the whole
business.
</P>
<P>
   But there's another way to look at it. In an excerpt from Tyler
Cowen's ``What Price Fame?'' juxtaposed against Wilson's screed,
Cowen argues that the quest for fame has produced ``many of the
triumphs of contemporary culture'' in the arts, in business, and in
science, ``all achieved at relatively low cost.'' Cowen concludes,
depressingly but probably rightly, that ``false beliefs can be very
useful for society.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   To be a parent is to experience the deepest joy available to
human beings and also the deepest anxiety and confusion.
</P>
<P>
   It's a vast emotional territory, one that Alec Wilkinson
affectingly traverses in an essay about his 6-year-old son, Sam, in
the June  &UR; Esquire. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Sam has a sensory disorder that makes him extra-sensitive to
sound and touch and complicates the act of speaking. That makes the
act of raising him more challenging, but the feelings Wilkinson
touches on are universal: the desire to fill your offspring's life
with as many happy moments as possible, the virtual end to other
forms of recreation (movies? what are movies?), and the bedrock
realization every parent has, Wilkinson writes, that your love for
your child makes you a ``hostage to the unfolding of the
universe.''

ON THE GENDER-BIAS WARPATH AGAIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE LEWIS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Pamela Martens' voice carries remnants of her Virginia
upbringing as well as a ring of frustration that's hard to ignore.
</P>
<P>
   ``If all the women (in this case) knew what was going on, they
would be angry, too,'' said Martens, who helped launch the
so-called ``Boom Boom Room'' gender-bias lawsuit against Salomon
Smith Barney four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Martens is on the warpath again. This time the 54-year-old
Long Island stockbroker has launched a nationwide e-mail campaign
to focus attention on the case and protest a two-year-old court
settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Martens, who is seeking a jury trial, withdrew from the larger
class-action lawsuit in 1998 because the settlement did not give
brokers with discrimination claims the ability to take their cases
to court. Rather, the settlement says civi-rights claims may be
resolved before an independent arbitrator.
</P>
<P>
   As part of their employment, stock brokers are required to
register with the National Association of Securities Dealers and
sign a so-called U-4 securities arbitration form mandating that any
dispute or claim against their employer be submitted to
arbitration.
</P>
<P>
   Many employees, particularly women and minorities, have argued
that the system denies them the right to present evidence to a
diverse panel of peers. Instead, they say, the mediators are older
white males with ties to the financial services industry.
</P>
<P>
   On May 16, a day after US District Court Justice Constance Baker
Motley of New York tossed out the individual complaints that
Martens and Judith Mione filed against the firm last year, Martens
fired off a string of e-mails protesting the decision.
</P>
<P>
   Motley dismissed the claims after finding that over a 15-month
period the pair ``neglected their individual claims and, instead,
devoted substantial efforts to derailing the class settlement. . .
. The court now concludes that Martens' and Mione's failure to
advance their individual claims stemmed not from confusion but from
inexcusable delay sufficient to dismiss those claims . . . for
failure to prosecute,'' wrote Motley.
</P>
<P>
   Enraged, Martens took her concerns to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been creating massive e-mail lists,'' Martens said.
``Over time, I've gathered the e-mails for all the human-rights
groups, for all the members of NOW in New York City, for all the
members of the Business and Professional Women's Association, and
for certain women's activists online. I think people ought to know
exactly what happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Originally from Appalachia, Martens arrived at Smith Barney in
1985 hoping to garner access to the wealth she'd never had.
</P>
<P>
   ``My son was 5 years old,'' she said. ``I started to look at
what it would take for me and my husband to educate him. I said `I
need to move on and find out how to manage and save money.' So I
entered a Smith Barney training program.''
</P>
<P>
   Ten years after her arrival, Martens received a ``big bronze
plaque for a decade of loyal and dedicated service.'' Yet, she
said, her branch manager in Garden City, Long Island, frequently
criticized female and minority brokers, oftentimes using
disparaging epithets behind their backs.
</P>
<P>
   She said the manager of her office invited male brokers to a
golfing club, but noted at the time that he had not planned to
invite any of the women. ``He also turned a storage room in the
basement into a bar and he had a toilet bowl and rusty bike hanging
from the ceiling,'' she recalled.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the PA system, he would invite all brokers for drinks in
the Boom Boom Room. The one time I went he had a black garbage can
with a (plastic) liner in it and a soup ladle to serve Bloody Marys
to brokers.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, after a group of female clerical workers were told they
must volunteer some of their personal time to their supervisor's
charity or lose raises and time off, Martens protested. She says
her anger increased when the manager insisted that stockbrokers
contribute money to his charity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I laced . . . into him,'' Martens said. ``I said, `What you
have done  &UR; today &LR;  is extortion and it calls into question your
competency as a manager.' He said, `I'll toss you out of this
office and we will throw a party.' ''
</P>
<P>
   After Martens complained to a company official, her supervisor
told stockbrokers in the bond room that he would ``snap my neck if
anything happened to him,'' she said. ``He'd stroll around the
floor waving a baseball bat. I shut my door and tried to stay away
from him.''
</P>
<P>
   Martens hired a lawyer in January 1995, and was fired nine
months later for failing to attend a required meeting. ``They had
never fired anyone for not attending a meeting. Instead,'' she
said, ``people got, as a standard practice, a fine, but even that
was not enforced.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, she filed a lawsuit against her employer. Four years
later, Martens is still up in arms.
</P>
<P>
   But whether she will be able to rally a significant wave of
support is another matter. The New York division of NOW is backing
her and so is a national student group. But NOW's national office
has backed the court settlement hammered out by the Chicago law
firm, Stowell &AMP; Friedman. In all, some 23,000 current and former
stockbrokers at Salomon Smith Barney will be impacted by the
agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had 14 and later 15 of the 25 original plaintiffs say they
wanted to move ahead with the settlement,'' recalled attorney Mary
Stowell of Stowell &AMP; Friedman. ``We sent out hundreds of copies of
settlements to the women, and we told them to check a Web site
(www.classactionsb.com) where the settlement has been posted.
</P>
<P>
   ``We also notified people of the class-action lawsuit of their
right to opt out and pursue individual claims,'' she continued.
``We had two fairness hearings where the judge wanted to see better
goals and timetables established for the hiring and promotion of
women and minorities. The judge also wanted to maintain
jurisdiction over that. . . . It is too bad Pamela Martens is
angry. We did a fabulous job for many in the class.''
</P>
<P>
   In making her decision last week, Motley noted that in removing
themselves from the class, Martens and Mione forfeited the right to
involve themselves in the affairs of the class. In other words,
once you're out, you're out.
</P>
<P>
   Martens disagrees, and she intends to appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Martens's 1994 complaint against Salomon Smith Barney, now a
unit of Citigroup Inc., sought not only monetary damages but also a
declaratory judgment against the investment firm, the New York
Stock Exchange, and the NASD, stating that mandatory arbitration of
employment discrimination and harassment charges violates federal
law.

HERE'S THE DRILL: BRISKET IS SOMETHING YOU GRILL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BEVERLY BUNDY 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   From the not-from-around-here category, we received a letter
from a reader in Trophy Club, Texas, who was confused about
brisket.
</P>
<P>
   ``My husband went to the grocery store for me last week and
tried to buy a beef brisket. He's not that familiar with cooking,
so he asked the person working in the meat department to help him
find a beef brisket.
</P>
<P>
   ``The woman in the meat department sent him home with a corned
beef brisket. I told my husband I thought there was a difference
between a beef brisket for barbecuing and a corned beef brisket. He
said the woman said they were the same thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``My cookbooks list them as two different cuts, but I can't find
any explanations between the differences. Can you help me figure
this out? Can a corned beef brisket be prepared in the same way?''
</P>
<P>
   My clue that the reader is a newcomer to Texas is that beef
brisket is often not even sold in the rest of the country. And when
it is, it is sold ``corned'' in the British tradition (meaning in
brine in a heavy plastic bag). That's also how we see corned beef
here.
</P>
<P>
   But in Texas, what is a trash cut of beef to most of the country
is the apple of the barbecuer's eye. It was German butchers in the
Texas Hill Country who turned brisket, a cut taken from the breast
section under the first five ribs of the steer, into a thing of
beauty. In an attempt to market this very tough cut that no one
would buy, the butchers began smoking them in the backs of their
shops. Yahoo. Texans fell in love.
</P>
<P>
   Beef brisket can be found in every supermarket in Texas in the
beef section. It will be packaged in Cryovac (heavy plastic wrap)
or simply plastic-wrapped on one of those foam trays. The
vacuum-wrapped briskets are ``packer-trimmed,'' meaning that it's
the entire brisket and the fat is not trimmed. The ``market trim''
is usually a portion of the brisket, either the point cut or the
less fatty flat. I think you need the fat for flavor, so I
generally buy the entire brisket and freeze any leftovers that
don't go into weekday sandwiches.
</P>
<P>
   Starting around Easter, and lasting through Labor Day, brisket
is very attractively priced (some stores have it for as low as 57
cents a pound at this time of year) because stores use it as a lure
for Texas grillers.
</P>
<P>
   Do not, and we repeat, do not use a corned beef on the grill.
You'll end up with a soggy mess. A corned beef is best cooked in a
slow cooker or on the stove top.

   In the ``Food Lover's Companion,'' Sharon Tyler Herbst says,
``Brisket requires long, slow cooking and is best when braised.''
We'll excuse Tyler Herbst _ she's not from around here, either. The
best way to cook a brisket, any Texan will tell you, is in a smoker
or on a grill. And here are instructions from the Weber Grill
folks.
</P>
<P>
   TEXAS BEEF BRISKET
</P>
<P>
   Serves 8-10
</P>
<P>
   5- to 6-pound beef brisket, untrimmed
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup rub for beef
</P>
<P>
   1 bottle beer
</P>
<P>
   Wood chips or chunks, optional
</P>
<P>
   Rub brisket liberally with rub up to 1 day in advance and
refrigerate. Prepare coals or turn on gas grill. If using a
charcoal grill, place a drip pan between 2 piles of coals. In a gas
grill, place the drip pan under the grate between flames. Pour beer
into drip pan.
</P>
<P>
   Place brisket, fat side up, in center of cooking grate over drip
pan. Place wood chips that have been soaked in water for 30 minutes
directly on coals or in smoker box in your gas grill. Grill 3 to 4
hours or until meat thermometer registers 180 degrees. When done,
remove from grill and let rest 10 minutes. Slice thinly and serve
immediately.
</P>
<P>
   Note: Be sure to add coals each hour to keep heat constant if
using a charcoal grill.

   A treat from 1187: Beatrice Thomason loved the salad dressing
she sampled at Cafe 1187 on Easter Sunday. Chef-owner Michele Tezak
was glad to share the recipe inspired by her mother, Jodie. Her
mother made the salad dressing at least 20 years ago, and Michele
simply adapted it. At Cafe 1187, the dressing is served on a simple
salad of crisp romaine and tomato wedges.

   CAFE 1187 RED ONION SALAD DRESSING
</P>
<P>
   Yields about 2 cups
</P>
<P>
   1/4 red wine vinegar
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon sugar
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon black pepper
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon salt

<P>
   1 egg

   1 teaspoon dried basil
</P>
<P>
   1 medium red onion, coarsely chopped
</P>
<P>
   3/4 to 1 cup vegetable oil
</P>
<P>
   Place all ingredients, except oil, in blender. Turn on blender
and process until mixture is pureed. While blender is running,
drizzle oil in a continuous thin stream through the hole in the
lid. Make sure to do this slowly so the dressing will emulsify, or
combine into one ``unit.'' You have used enough oil when the hole
in the middle of the onion mixture, caused by the blender's
mechanism, has disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   This dressing can be turned into a seasoned mayonnaise by simply
adding more oil. Tezak suggests using a food processor instead of a
blender if you're making mayonnaise.

PALESTINIAN PRISONERS IN ISRAEL END HUNGER STRIKE 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: This early version will be updated as needed.) 
 By WILLIAM A. ORME Jr.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails ended a
month-long hunger strike Wednesday, averting a further round of
street protests that many here had feared could derail peace talks
between Israel and the Palestinian Authority.
</P>
<P>
   In a compromise forged by the authority's Ministry for
Prisoners' Affairs, Israel granted the inmates more liberal family
visitation rights and moved five prisoners out of solitary
confinement, among other concessions. Some 500 prisoners who had
been on a liquid diet for the past 31 days called off the protest,
though they continued to demand that other inmates be freed from
solitary confinement.
</P>
<P>
   Demonstrations in the West Bank and Gaza in favor of the
prisoners erupted into violence last week, leading to a suspension
of peace talks and to gun battles with the Israeli military that
left six Palestinians dead.
</P>
<P>
   The peace talks, which had been held in Stockholm, are to resume
in an unannounced location in the Middle East as soon as Thursday,
according to Israeli state radio. President Clinton and Prime
Minister Ehud Barak are to discuss the talks Thursday in Portugal.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian officials hailed Wednesday's deal as a belated
Israeli recognition of the extreme sensitivity of the issue of the
prisoners. But they repeated demands for the release of some 500
Palestinians who have been held in Israeli prisons for crimes of
political violence since before the the May 1994 start of
land-for-peace negotiations with Israel.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not fully satisfied, but the significant thing is that
this was a clear message from the Palestinian people that the
prisoners' cause is fundamental and needs to be resolved,'' said
Qadoura Fares, a Palestinian legislator who helped negotiate the
compromise. ``I believe the Israelis understood the message.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Hundreds of protesters camped for the past month in plazas
throughout the Palestinian territories had also been fasting in
support of the striking prisoners. The protests were called off
Wednesday, Issa Qarake, a chief organizer, said in Bethlehem.
</P>
<P>
   ``The solidarity activities in the street helped the prisoners
to achieve their main demands,'' Qarake said
</P>
<P>
   Among the concessions extracted by Palestinian negotiators was
the right of young children to visit with imprisoned parents
unimpeded by barred barriers. Prisoners will also now be allowed to
telephone their families on special occasions like weddings and
funerals, and to pursue studies with Palestinian universities,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Israel released some 360 long-term prisoners over the past year
in accord with agreements negotiated with the Palestinian
Authority. Palestinian negotiators are asking Israel to release
another 230 pre-1994 prisoners who they say were not directly
involved with fatal attacks against Israelis _ the key Israeli
criterion for their possible release.

CHINESE BEAT U.S. WOMEN, 1-0, IN SOCCER REMATCH 
</HEADLINE>
   By JERE LONGMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The audience and the temperature had fallen precipitously since
their last meeting, but the United States and China played a
riveting rematch in women's soccer in Canberra, Australia early
Wednesday. Again, the match was decided by a penalty kick, this
time in regulation. And this time, China prevailed.
</P>
<P>
   Four minutes from the end of regulation, the Chinese forward Sun
Wen got tangled with defender Danielle Slaton, and the two fell
down in the penalty area. China was awarded a penalty kick, and Sun
calmly placed her shot in the upper right corner for a 1-0 victory.
</P>
<P>
   The last time these teams had played, July 10, 1999, they had
drawn the largest audience ever to watch a women's sporting event _
90,185 at the Rose Bowl for the final of the Women's World Cup. The
rematch, held in the first round of the Pacific Cup tournament in
the Australian capital, was played Wednesday before an estimated
550 fans. And those summer temperatures that had risen above 100
degrees on the Rose Bowl turf last July had dipped to freezing in
the Southern Hemisphere's late autumn.
</P>
<P>
   Playing on a field made choppy from rugby matches and missing
three vital starters _ goalkeeper Briana Scurry (shin splints),
midfielder Michelle Akers (shoulder surgery) and defender Carla
Overbeck (knee surgery) _ the Americans outshot China by 10-5 but,
as in the World Cup, could not manufacture a goal during
regulation. Mia Hamm did not play one of her better games, and she
was replaced by Nikki Serlenga in the 81st minute.
</P>
<P>
   Five minutes later, after miscommunication in midfield between
Julie Foudy and Cindy Parlow, the ball bounced free in the penalty
area. Slaton attempted to shield it from a charging Sun, protecting
it for the sliding American goalkeeper Siri Mullinix, but Slaton
and Sun collided and the referee signaled a penalty kick.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a marginal call; nonetheless we weren't going to win
the game without scoring,'' Coach April Heinrichs said in a
telephone interview from Australia.
</P>
<P>
   Last July, after two overtime periods, the Americans had
prevailed 5-4 in a penalty kick shootout on Brandi Chastain's
famous shot. In the rematch, the Americans missed three point-blank
chances to score in regulation, Heinrichs said. In the 90th minute,
Milbrett ran onto a pass from Parlow and angled a shot from the
left side of the penalty area that beat goalkeeper Han Wenxia but
sailed just wide of the right goal post.
</P>
<P>
   ``We played well at times, but it would be misleading to say we
dominated, and it would be misleading to say the game was anything
more than a 1-0 game, with both teams having the possibility to
win,'' Heinrichs said. ``I don't think there was melodrama around
the big rematch.''
</P>
<P>
   With the captain Overbeck unavailable, Heinrichs moved Joy
Fawcett into central defense and started Christie Pearce at right
back. Lorrie Fair replaced Akers in defensive midfield, and
Mullinix continued to play capably at goalkeeper, aggressively
coming off her line. Sun, voted the most valuable player in the
World Cup, was muzzled for the first 85 minutes, until she broke
free to gain a penalty kick.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was very pleased how we played in the back,'' Heinrichs
said.
</P>
<P>
   China made one key change, replacing longtime goalkeeper Gao
Hong with Han. Gao, who has uncertain hands, had played poorly in a
3-0 loss to Norway at an important tournament in Portugal in March.
The entire Chinese team had seemed lethargic and overtrained in
Portugal, only to appear reinvigorated for the rematch against the
Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ``They looked tired, uninvested in Portugal,'' Heinrichs said.
``Tonight, they were invested.''
</P>
<P>
   The teams are expected to play a handful of times this year,
including again in Australia at the 2000 Summer Olympics in
September. Five consecutive matches between the United States and
China have been decided by one goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every one of those games is going to be excruciating,''
Heinrichs said.

 &HT;    IN BOOM TIMES, SOME NEW GRADS HOLD OUT FOR FULFILLMENT
 &HT;    With YOUNG-DATA. For release Sunday, June 4.
 &HT;    By CHARLES W. HOLMES
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLLEGE PARK, Md. _ A computer sciences graduate recently left
his Ivy League university straight for a newly formed software
company. Starting salary and benefits package: $250,000.
</P>
<P>
   The Class of 2000 has it made. The college graduates, 1.2
million of them, are entering the job market in a soaring economy,
with corporate America hungry for new workers.
</P>
<P>
   Show them the money _ but show them more. Mere mega-salaries and
stock options fail to impress many of these twentysomethings, whose
college careers have coincided with the nation's longest peacetime
economic expansion.
</P>
<P>
   Many are in no rush to begin chasing their first million. In
opinion polls and interviews, they rate job satisfaction, corporate
values and family life over personal wealth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just sitting in a room and writing (computer) code didn't
appeal to me,'' said Joel Martinsen, 22, a mathematics graduate
from the University of Maryland at College Park.
</P>
<P>
   His roommate took a job with IBM, which offered a signing bonus
and a $55,000-a-year salary.
</P>
<P>
   Martinsen, of Rockville, Md., leaves in late June for China,
where he'll work in the remote northern province of Jilin as an
English teacher for two years, and teach himself to speak Chinese.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not exactly a high-tech, high-paying job, but it's a
chance for me to learn. And who knows, with the China trade
agreement maybe it'll be useful for me when I'm looking for a job
down the road,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The trend is almost counter-revolutionary amid the dot-com
revolution.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it is the ultimate indulgence amid America's boom times,
the luxury to be picky about a job or to defer a career altogether.
Whatever the reason, the current crop of graduates seems less
materialistic and more concerned with their quality of life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've reached this turning point in my life where every job
I've had so far has been monkey work. A trained chimpanzee could do
my job,'' said Erica Lapidus, 28, of Plainview, N.Y., who works for
a corporate head-hunter. When she finishes her master's degree in
international business management this fall at Nova Southeastern
University in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., she wants a fulfilling job in
marketing that allows her to travel the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes me miserable just to roll out of bed in the morning.
I want a job that I love,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   More than four-fifths of men and women in their 20s said that
having a flexible work schedule that allows them time with their
families was more important than a status job or making a high
salary, according to a recent poll by the Radcliffe Public Policy
Center.
</P>
<P>
   According to a survey of more than 3,000 students conducted late
last year by Jobtrak.com, an online career-placement service, money
ranked a distant second to ``balancing work and personal life'' in
a listing of career values. Flexible work hours, the ability to
telecommute and living in a specific region of the nation were more
important than income level or signing bonuses.
</P>
<P>
   Adjusted for inflation, the average wage in America has actually
dipped slightly since 1964. The figures do not reflect non-salary
compensation such as stock options and other benefits now being
used to lure new workers.
</P>
<P>
   But aside from the robust economy, wage stagnation and the
decline in mutual loyalty between workers and employers could be
two possible explanations for the new lifestyle-over-money attitude
among college grads.
</P>
<P>
   Sun Microsystems, the software giant, has more than 3,100 jobs
to fill. A special Web site targeted to prospective workers
reflects the new reality of what students want, and includes a
come-on that offers something for everyone: ``Stick your neck out.
Get your hands dirty. Lose yourself in the work. Pick your hours
(and your attire) to suit your style.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Scott's words (CEO Scott McNealy), ``Kick butt, and have
fun.'' That means we expect 110% from everyone, but also honor and
support a balanced life. Our many perks can help with many personal
time-management challenges, the rest is up to you. Does this kind
of environment appeal to you? If it does, you could really thrive
here.''
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, college graduates with high-tech degrees in computer
sciences and engineering are in high demand, commanding average
starting salaries of about $50,000. About half of the 1.6 million
tech jobs available this year will go unfilled due to a lack of
qualified and trained candidates, according to the Information
Technology Association of America.
</P>
<P>
   But the need for skilled workers cuts across nearly every field,
with demand up this year for marketing and management grads and
liberal arts majors such as communications and psychology.
</P>
<P>
   Jobtrak.com, which monitors job-posting data at U.S. colleges
and universities, reported that there was a 40.8 percent increase
in the number of available jobs last April compared to a year
earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Corporate recruiters have scrambled to woo new workers,
including forays onto college campuses that have begun targeting
not only seniors, but also students in their junior year.
</P>
<P>
   They've also begin making stops at the traditional spring break
beaches. Along with the thousands of revelers in hot spots like
Panama City, Fla., and Myrtle Beach, S.C., last spring were scores
of corporate recruiters holding job fairs among the beer bashes.
</P>
<P>
   In Silicon Valley, the California bastion of the high-tech
economy, the recruitment frenzy is so wild that gimmicks include
raffles in return for resumes. Apply for a job, and qualify to win
a new BMW or a trip to Cancun.
</P>
<P>
   A dozen or more Web sites specialize in marrying recruiters with
potential workers, allowing students to post their resumes
electronically.
</P>
<P>
   ``Money is a factor, obviously. But it is a mistake to assume
that it is the end-all,'' said Monica Feid, spokeswes have jobs or
job offers by the time of graduation. This year, more than half
have found work.
</P>
<P>
   Many have job offers, but are choosing to postpone a decision.
</P>
<P>
   Dennis Hogan, 23, of Philadelphia, an engineering grad, is
weighing offers from private firms, or may take a lower-paying job
with the state of California's transportation department for the
chance to live the West Coast lifestyle. He'll decide soon, but for
now his mind is on an upcoming summer trip to Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   ``They feel, 'I'll get a job after I graduate and I've traveled
or done some other enriching things.' They don't feel pressed for
time,'' said Camille Luckenbaugh of the National Association of
Colleges and Employers in Bethlehem, Pa. ``The economy is that
good.''

&HT;     CLINTON, LAZIO BATTLE FOR UNDECIDED VOTERS 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   BUFFALO, N.Y. _ Pop quiz: The U.S. Senate candidate wants to
boost public education, protect the environment, wire up schools to
the Internet and protect health benefits for the disadvantaged. Oh,
and no mudslinging on the campaign trail. It's all about issues.
</P>
<P>
   Who is the candidate? Republican Rick Lazio or Democrat Hillary
Rodham Clinton?
</P>
<P>
   Both.
</P>
<P>
   For all of the talk of the stark differences between Lazio and
Clinton in the race for Senate, the four-term congressman from Long
Island is espousing many of the same themes that the first lady has
embraced in her 10 months on the campaign trail.
</P>
<P>
   And while he lashed out at Clinton for engaging in political
mudslinging, Lazio said his campaign is aimed at ``bringing people
together and building a stronger New York through unity, not
through division'' _ rhetoric that closely resembles that of the
first lady.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our campaign tactic is going to be to unite New Yorkers _ it's
about positive changes,'' Lazio told a packed ballroom at a women's
luncheon Tuesday afternoon. ``We have 150 days as the world looks
at us to prove who we are. This campaign is going to be about
inspiration and bringing people together and not going down the
dark path of division and hate.''
</P>
<P>
   Compare that to Clinton:
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to be the kind of leader who lifts people up, not
pushes them down,'' Clinton said on a recent campaign swing, asking
her crowd to ``reject the politics of division, revenge and
retribution.''
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, there are some distinct differences between the two.
Since Lazio entered the race last month when New York Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani abandoned his campaign, Clinton's camp has compared the
congressman to former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, the stridently
conservative politician who pushed through the Contract with
America in the historic 1994 Republican takeover of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio voted in favor of the contract in his first term and was
personally aided by Gingrich in winning two prominent committee
assignments.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio is also eager to point out differences between him and the
first lady.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you talk about what's mainstream and what's not, I think
most people in New York would consider tax relief as an important
issue,'' Lazio said, ticking off what he says are the three top
issues that set them apart. ``Most people would look at health care
and say, `Yeah, we need to extend prescription benefits for
seniors; we need to do it in a responsible way.' We don't want to
turn over our health care system to the federal government, to this
faceless bureaucracy. On the environment, one person can talk about
(protecting) it and one person's been doing it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of differences between Mrs. Clinton and
myself,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But with a small number of New Yorkers who have yet to decide
between Clinton and Lazio, neither candidate wants to be portrayed
as anything but mainstream and conciliatory to avoid alienating any
voters. Recent polls show Clinton and Lazio already locked in a
statistical dead heat, with as few as 6 to 10 percent of voters
undecided.
</P>
<P>
   Even Clinton spokesman Howard Wolfson indicated he was surprised
at Lazio's relative restraint on a day ripe for red-meat Republican
rhetoric.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sounds as though they've been reading her speeches,'' he
said. ``The difference is, one person has been saying it for a
year, and one person's been saying it for a day. These are the
themes Hillary Clinton has been campaigning on over the last
year.''

   Sacagawea, a Shoshone Indian who assisted Meriwether Lewis and
William Clark on their journey from the Northern Great Plains to
the Pacific Ocean in 1804-1806, is portrayed with her son Jean
Baptiste.
</P>
<P>
   There are no documented pictures of Sacagawea, so Goodacre
recruited as a model Randy'L Teton, 23, an arts student and member
of the Shoshone-Bannock tribe from the Fort Hall Indian Reservation
in Idaho.
</P>
<P>
   Goodacre, a West Texas native with residences in Sante Fe, N.M.,

publisher of a Web site devoted to Jeff ``Frugal Gourmet'' Smith.
</P>
<P>
   The bourree, a dance within the overall composition, is included
on the Classical Treasures CD ``Best of Handel'' by
Madacy/Duplicate Numbers and many other Handel collections.
</P>
<P>
   One place that offers ``Best of Handel'' is the classical and
jazz retailer CD Choice. Call (800) 648-2224 or visit the Web site
www.cdchoice.com.
</P>
<P>
   An audio clip of the theme is available on Warda's site,

<P>
   TAIBE, SOUTHERN LEBANON _ In the government hospital in Nabatea,
Abbas Koussan's battered face and body are a mark of shame on his
country; on the Hezbollah militia who liberated his village of
Taibe, on the U.N. troops who failed to protect him, on the
government security men who refused him permission to tell his
story even in his hospital bed, on the Israelis who tried to
blackmail him into collaboration.
</P>
<P>
   And on his neighbors in the pretty little Shiite Muslim hamlet,
some of whom _ convinced that he was (italics: was) a collaborator
_ beat Abbas Koussan insensible in the center of the village after
looting his little shop.
</P>
<P>
   I happen to know Abbas. I don't believe he was a fifth columnist
or an informer. The Israelis and their proxy militia tried to
intimidate him and blackmail him and they tortured him because they
thought he worked for the Lebanese army.
</P>
<P>
   They even asked him about my own movements in southern Lebanon.
But he was no spy. It didn't save him.
</P>
<P>
   There was no Lebanese government to protect him _ any more than
there was a government force to save the life of the Christian
civilian in Rmeich who was shot dead by an Amal gunman in a dispute
Sunday afternoon. For these are increasingly dangerous days in
southern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   Abbas Koussan knows it all too well. Having endured months of
harsh imprisonment in the notorious Khiam jail, he thought he was
safe running his store below the old Israeli gun position, selling
jackets and knives and sunglasses to Finnish U.N. soldiers,
drinking cups of coffee outside with his brothers Mohsen and Bilal
and sister Dalal.
</P>
<P>
   Then on Saturday morning, at 10 o'clock, at least 30 armed men
drove up to the shop, many of them carrying rocket-propelled
grenade launchers and Hezbollah flags. They said they were from
Hezbollah and they tore down pictures of the rival Amal flag and of
President Emile Lahoud of Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   Then they went into the house, ransacking every room, seizing
two legally owned pistols and a hunting gun and then thieving their
way through the shop below.
</P>
<P>
   The men knew the names of the intruders. There were Nehme Abbas
and Mohamed from the Souli family and Reda and Hassan Marmar who
lived just down the road.
</P>
<P>
   ``They screamed at us that we were dogs and bitches and they
said they were going to kill Abbas,'' Dalal said Sunday. ``He was
put in a car with two other men and taken into the village. They
opened fire everywhere _ into the house, the shop, around our feet,
over our head. They beat the rest of us, even the children. A car
came back later and Abbas's unconscious body was tipped out onto
the road.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought he was already dead because there was so much
blood,'' Dalal said. ``We got him into the house and the U.N. came
and gave medical assistance. It was about the only thing the U.N.
did.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was half and hour before the U.N. soldiers got to the
house, and turned up at the stagnant village pool _ known to the
U.N. as `Cholera Pond' _ where Abbas and two other men, Assad Souli
and Mohamed Musri, were beaten with rifles and clubs. The U.N. who
would have been outnumbered 30 to 12, have an observation post 30
seconds walk from the pond.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Cholera Pond Sunday, the crowd were all ignorance.
``Nothing happened here,'' an old man with a white beard lied to
me. And when I asked to talk to Ali Rislan, one of the local
Hezbollah leaders, he repeated the same story.
</P>
<P>
   With sunglasses shading his face and dressed from head to toe in
black, he was a little taken aback when I contacted Hezbollah
headquarters by phone _ and when a Hezbollah official in Beirut
asked him to cooperate with my enquiries. ``Wait here,'' Rislan
said.
</P>
<P>
   An hour later, a young man in the local mosque apologized for
Rislan's absence. ``He got a very bad toothache and we had to take
him to a dentist,'' he said. ``Can you imagine what it's like
trying to find a dentist around here?'' I could.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happened,'' the young man continued, ``was that some of
the local people _ not Hezbollah, you must understand _ were very
angry at some collaborators who lived in the village. They took
three of them to the pool here and beat them. Even some women were
doing the beating.
</P>
<P>
   ``Abbas Koussan _ you know there was a photograph we saw of him
yesterday eating a meal with the head of Israeli intelligence at
Metulla or somewhere. Yes, he was in prison but he was a
stool-pigeon.''
</P>
<P>
   I didn't believe that, I said. He had spoken with deep enmity of
his country's occupiers and had always told me the truth about
events in the occupation zone.
</P>
<P>
   Why had the gunmen looted the shop and stolen the family jeep
and mobile telephone? Why could Hezbollah not stop such acts of
anarchy in a village which they controlled? &QL;

   ``We thought he was already dead because there was so much
blood,'' Dalal said. ``We got him into the house and the U.N. came
and gave medical assistance. It was about the only thing the U.N.
did.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was half and hour before the U.N. soldiers got to the
house, and turned up at the stagnant village pool _ known to the
U.N. as `Cholera Pond' _ where Abbas and two other men, Assad Souli
and Mohamed Musri, were beaten with rifles and clubs. The U.N. who
would have been outnumbered 30 to 12, have an observation post 30
seconds walk from the pond.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Cholera Pond Sunday, the crowd were all ignorance.
``Nothing happened here,'' an old man with a white beard lied to
me. And when I asked to talk to Ali Rislan, one of the local
Hezbollah leaders, he repeated the same story.
</P>
<P>
   With sunglasses shading his face and dressed from head to toe in
black, he was a little taken aback when I contacted Hezbollah
headquarters by phone _ and when a Hezbollah official in Beirut
asked him to cooperate with my enquiries. ``Wait here,'' Rislan
said.
</P>
<P>
   An hour later, a young man in the local mosque apologized for
Rislan's absence. ``He got a very bad toothache and we had to take
him to a dentist,'' he said. ``Can you imagine what it's like
trying to find a dentist around here?'' I could.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happened,'' the young man continued, ``was that some of
the local people _ not Hezbollah, you must understand _ were very
angry at some collaborators who lived in the village. They took
three of them to the pool here and beat them. Even some women were
doing the beating.
</P>
<P>
   ``Abbas Koussan _ you know there was a photograph we saw of him
yesterday eating a meal with the head of Israeli intelligence at
Metulla or somewhere. Yes, he was in prison but he was a
stool-pigeon.''
</P>
<P>
   I didn't believe that, I said. He had spoken with deep enmity of
his country's occupiers and had always told me the truth about
events in the occupation zone.
</P>
<P>
   Why had the gunmen looted the shop and stolen the family jeep
and mobile telephone? Why could Hezbollah not stop such acts of
anarchy in a village which they controlled? &QL;

   (UNDATED) _ Most of the world's 6,000-plus languages will have
died out by the end of the century, experts predicted Monday.
Linguists issued fresh warnings about the perilous position of the
thousands of languages spoken mainly by adults but increasingly
rarely by their children and grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   They said the continuing drive for the young to communicate in
one of the three most popular tongues _ English, Spanish or
Mandarin _ threatens to destroy a key ingredient of humanity's
cultural heritage.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists estimate there are 6,000 to 8,000 identifiable
languages in the world and that most are spoken by less than a few
thousand individuals, making them especially vulnerable to
extinction.
</P>
<P>
   In areas where native languages are well studied _ notably North
America and Australia _ it is estimated that up to 90 percent will
be lost in the next few generations.
</P>
<P>
   Extrapolating the findings to the wider world, linguists
estimate that at least half and probably nearer three-quarters of
languages spoken today will be lost forever before the century is
out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ninety percent of languages today are each spoken by less than
100,000 people. With most languages being spoken by a small number
of individuals, that makes them very vulnerable,'' said Steve
Levinson, of the Max Planck institute for psycholinguists at
Nijmegen, in the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
   Only 200 to 250 languages are spoken by more than a million
people, with English, Spanish and Mandarin expanding faster than
any of the other popular tongues, Dr. Levinson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless something amazing happens, the estimates for the rate
of loss are probably right. We're losing our natural laboratory of
variation, our Galapagos,'' said Dr. Levinson, referring to islands
where Darwin studied the diversity of life.
</P>
<P>
   Matthias Brenzinger, of the University of Cologne in Germany,
who for the past year has led an investigation aimed at rating the
degree of danger faced by languages, said the scale of the problem
is immense. ``Most of the currently receding languages will
disappear without even being recorded,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In Papua New Guinea, which boasts the richest diversity of
languages in the world, many young people prefer to communicate in
``tok psin,'' which literally means ``talk pigin'' English, than
the language of their elders, Dr. Levinson said. ``We know of many
cases of language replacement taking place wholesale,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   English is growing in popularity because many people believe
their children will be better off as a result. Spanish and Chinese
are growing largely for demographic reasons _ as a result of
expanding populations, Dr. Levinson said.
</P>
<P>
   Languages can also be lost more dramatically through war and
ethnic genocide, as well as mass migrations and cultural
imperialism.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why should we be worried? For all sorts of reasons, including
sentiment. We will have lost the products of human creativity and
the extent of language variation gives us insight into the nature
of ourselves,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   South American children who speak the Mayan language Tzeltal,
for instance, learn how to distinguish between north and south when
they are as young as four as a result of the way their speech
inherently relates the geographical position of objects being
discussed.
</P>
<P>
   Only rarely is a dying language saved. One of the most famous
examples is the Mohawk language spoken by the indigenous people who
live in the Quebec region of Canada. Linguists began working with
Mohawk-speakers in the early 1970s to codify spelling conventions
and syntax.
</P>
<P>
   Mohawk lessons were offered as part of the curriculum of
elementary schools in Quebec and now hundreds of children have
learned a language that would probably have died out by now. &QL;

AMATEUR PIANO COMPETITION TAKES HEART _ AND BRAINS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By WAYNE LEE GAY 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Van Cliburn has been a professional musician
virtually all his life, having been trained by his mother for a
performing career. But the renowned Fort Worth-based pianist is
also an amateur in at least one respect: He practices music that he
will never perform in public, such as the sonatas of Schubert and
the keyboard music of J.S. Bach.
</P>
<P>
   ``I play music that I don't perform to hear the sounds from my
own fingers,'' he says. ``I play something that's close to my
heart.''
</P>
<P>
   Playing music from the heart is what inspires participants in
the Cliburn Foundation-sponsored International Piano Competition
for Outstanding Amateurs,
</P>
<P>
   which begins Monday and runs through June 10 at Ed Landreth
Auditorium on the Texas Christian University campus in Fort Worth.
And Cliburn is fully in tune with the spiritual and emotional
aspect of playing for the love of music.
</P>
<P>
   Cliburn sees the amateur competition as reaffirming the appeal
and durability of classical music. ``Those whom we call amateurs
live their lives as missionaries for classical music,'' he said in
a recent telephone interview. ``That's terribly important. And it
proves that the future is secure for great music.''
</P>
<P>
   The missionaries participating in this year's amateur
competition represent a cross section of society and are a
remarkably accomplished group, numbering medical doctors, lawyers
and academics.
</P>
<P>
   James S. Catterall, a cognitive scientist and professor of
education and information studies at the University of California
at Los Angeles, says this isn't an accident.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you get a lot of people over 35 who are accomplished
pianists, you're going to find that they are pretty accomplished at
other things, too,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   What may be surprising _ and certainly relevant, given the
credentials of many of the competitors _ is that playing the
keyboard has a stronger link to intelligence than any other form of
music-making, according to Catterall.
</P>
<P>
   ``The keyboard has a prominent geometry,'' he says. ``It is the
best for spatial, temporal reasoning _ ordering things in space and
time. It's lots better than computer training for this sort of
thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-four percent of the participants are professors of
medicine or health-care professionals at the doctoral level.
Attorneys, engineers, scientists and college professors are also
represented in substantial numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Hawley, for example, is a professor of media technology
at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He says that he is
energized when he is performing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year, when I started practicing piano after not playing
for four years, I noticed how much more creative I was in all of my
work,'' Hawley says. ``And how out of balance I was when I wasn't
practicing.''
</P>
<P>
   Cliburn does not need statistical evidence to second Catterall's
view that music can be significant in the development of the mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a mental stimulus, in addition to its spiritual
aspect,'' Cliburn says. ``Music is one of the essential academic
subjects.''
</P>
<P>
   And, he adds: ``The great works are to be played by everyone.
There is a responsibility for everyone to know about great music.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though his training was focused on a professional career,
Cliburn says that music appreciation need not have an ulterior
motive.
</P>
<P>
   ``When a young person studies music, it should be approached not
from the standpoint of becoming a performer, but from the direction
of learning the depth of the music,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   This year's amateur event is the second in what will become a
biennial competition in Fort Worth. Last year's amateur inaugural
was so successful that it was decided to have the contest every
other year. To fit the competition into the Cliburn's quadrennial
cycle, and take advantage of the local and national interest,
Cliburn Foundation executive director Richard Rodzinski decided to
have the second amateur competition this year before switching to
every other year.
</P>
<P>
   This year's competition will demonstrate a number of
enhancements. The first-prize winner will be presented in recital
at the Hirshhorn Museum in Washington, D.C., on June 18, a little
over a week after the end of the competition.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to prizes of $2,000, $1,000 and $500 for the top
three winners, the best performances of baroque, classical,
romantic and modern works will win $250 each.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since the basic concept of having an amateur contest is to
reward people who are dedicated to music, more awards means more
opportunities to reward,'' Rodzinski says.
</P>
<P>

<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Las Vegas has a colorful history of offering
refuge _ to scam artists, mobsters, racketeers and the criminally
insane, for a start.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps that explains why the city has been so ready to offer a
helping hand to an altogether different category of fugitive:
writers under threat from oppressive foreign governments.
</P>
<P>
   Las Vegas has just been named North America's first ``City of
Asylum'' _ the political sort of asylum, that is _ under a program
run by the International Parliament of Writers.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to the largesse of local gambling moguls and other
private donors, authors and intellectuals persecuted in Sudan, say,
or Iran, or Serbia, will be able to live in the Nevada desert free
of charge for a year.
</P>
<P>
   What they will make of a city where it is almost impossible to
find a bookshop, much less a vibrant literary culture, remains to
be seen.
</P>
<P>
   The scheme was dreamed up by Wole Soyinka, the Nigerian Nobel
laureate and president of the International Parliament of Writers,
who received an honorary degree from the University of Nevada at
Las Vegas last year.
</P>
<P>
   He floated the idea past Richard Wiley, an English professor at
UNLV, who in turn contacted a chum who runs the Mandalay Bay casino
resort.
</P>
<P>
   Soon they had raised enough money to invite the first writer to
take up residence this autumn. The name of the recipient will be
announced soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``The writer is rare who's never written purple prose. And Las
Vegas is purple prose, writ large,'' Soyinka said wryly as the
program was unveiled a few days ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a rather perverse way, Las Vegas actually echoes or mirrors
the predicament of the writer. The writer creates, in effect, a
virtual society, a virtual community. If ever there was a virtual
city, it is Las Vegas.''
</P>
<P>
   The City of Asylum idea grew out of Salman Rushdie's predicament
in the shadow of the Iranian fatwa. Strasbourg offered Rushdie
asylum in 1993, an offer that was turned down but which
nevertheless led to other cities _ Barcelona, Venice, Berlin and
Mexico City _ making similar offers to other writers.
</P>
<P>
   If Las Vegas has been quick to embrace the idea, it is partly
because it is seeking respectability and a reputation that goes
beyond gambling and whoring.
</P>
<P>
   Not all its citizens approve, however. Lou Piccinnetti, a
security guard, told a local newspaper he thought traffic fines
should be reduced for low-income residents before money was
lavished on foreigners. ``What about the persecuted people here?''
he asked. ``Who's going to help us?'' &QL;

NEW HOME SALES DROP 5.8 PERCENT IN APRIL 
</HEADLINE>
   By STEVEN VAMES   
 c. 2000 NYTimes.com/TheStreet.com   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sales of new homes dropped sharply in April to the lowest level
since November, echoing other evidence that have shown slowing home
sales across the country as mortgage rates continue to rise.
</P>
<P>
   New home sales fell 5.8 percent in April to a seasonally
adjusted 909,000 annual rate, the Commerce Department reported
Wednesday following an upwardly revised 5.8 percent pace in March.
Sales in April were significantly lower than the 3.2 percent drop
to a 937,000 annual pace that economists had been expecting,
according to a Reuters poll.
</P>
<P>
   While the data indicates that housing markets are feeling the
pinch of higher interest rates and the sell-off in technology
stocks, home sales continue to remain near historically high
levels. March, which has been revised from an originally-reported
4.5 percent pace of new home sales, was the second highest on
record.
</P>
<P>
   The news is likely to comfort economists and policy makers, who
have been looking for signs that the economy is slowing in response
the Federal Reserve's year-long effort to raise interest rates. But
anecdotal evidence indicates that the demand for homes in some of
the hottest U.S. markets is still outpacing supply, and that home
prices in those markets are still rising, even as sales are
slowing.
</P>
<P>
   But the new home sales data Wednesday provide some of the first
evidence that home prices may be moderating in response to slowing
sales. The Commerce Department also reported that the median sales
price for a new home dipped to $161,400 in April from $165,000 in
March.
</P>
<P>
   Most economists say higher mortgage rates are having the largest
influence on the slowing housing market, quelling demand as the
cost of financing goes up. According to mortgage giant Freddie Mac,
the Fed's most recent increase in short-term rates on May 16 pushed
mortgage rates sharply higher. The rate for a typical 30-year
fixed-rate mortgage stood at 8.62 percent last week, compared with
an average 8.15 percent for April, and 7.15 percent in May 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Other data Wednesday indicated that interest rates are also
having a broader effect on the economy. The Conference Board, a
private business research group, said its index of leading economic
indicators, a grouping of economic data designed to forecast future
economic activity, dipped 0.1 percent in April, following a 0.1
percent increase in March and a 0.3 percent decline in February.

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Las Vegas has a colorful history of offering
refuge _ to scam artists, mobsters, racketeers and the criminally
insane, for a start.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps that explains why the city has been so ready to offer a
helping hand to an altogether different category of fugitive:
writers under threat from oppressive foreign governments.
</P>
<P>
   Las Vegas has just been named North America's first ``City of
Asylum'' _ the political sort of asylum, that is _ under a program
run by the International Parliament of Writers.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to the largesse of local gambling moguls and other
private donors, authors and intellectuals persecuted in Sudan, say,
or Iran, or Serbia, will be able to live in the Nevada desert free
of charge for a year.
</P>
<P>
   What they will make of a city where it is almost impossible to
find a bookshop, much less a vibrant literary culture, remains to
be seen.
</P>
<P>
   The scheme was dreamed up by Wole Soyinka, the Nigerian Nobel
laureate and president of the International Parliament of Writers,
who received an honorary degree from the University of Nevada at
Las Vegas last year.
</P>
<P>
   He floated the idea past Richard Wiley, an English professor at
UNLV, who in turn contacted a chum who runs the Mandalay Bay casino
resort.
</P>
<P>
   Soon they had raised enough money to invite the first writer to
take up residence this autumn. The name of the recipient will be
announced soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``The writer is rare who's never written purple prose. And Las
Vegas is purple prose, writ large,'' Soyinka said wryly as the
program was unveiled a few days ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a rather perverse way, Las Vegas actually echoes or mirrors
the predicament of the writer. The writer creates, in effect, a
virtual society, a virtual community. If ever there was a virtual
city, it is Las Vegas.''
</P>
<P>
   The City of Asylum idea grew out of Salman Rushdie's predicament
in the shadow of the Iranian fatwa. Strasbourg offered Rushdie
asylum in 1993, an offer that was turned down but which
nevertheless led to other cities _ Barcelona, Venice, Berlin and
Mexico City _ making similar offers to other writers.
</P>
<P>
   If Las Vegas has been quick to embrace the idea, it is partly
because it is seeking respectability and a reputation that goes
beyond gambling and whoring.
</P>
<P>
   Not all its citizens approve, however. Lou Piccinnetti, a
security guard, told a local newspaper he thought traffic fines
should be reduced for low-income residents before money was
lavished on foreigners. ``What about the persecuted people here?''
he asked. ``Who's going to help us?'' &QL;

<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Almost a week after Israel's troops beat a hasty
retreat from Lebanon, Yasser Arafat has publicly acknowledged that
he faces growing political pressure to emulate the success of
Hezbollah's guerrilla forces.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hezbollah are being portrayed as heroes in the Arab world,
while the Palestinians look like losers,'' he reportedly told an
Israeli minister, Dalia Itzik, at a meeting in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
   His remarks were made two weeks after more than a week of bloody
unrest _ the so-called ``Days of Rage'' _ in the West Bank and
Gaza.
</P>
<P>
   The unrest began as a protest over prisoners in Israeli jails
but grew to reflect deep frustration among young Palestinians over
the failure of Arafat and his team to secure sufficient results in
six years of peace negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   According to Israel's Ma'ariv newspaper, Arafat's comments were
unusually forthright. ``You have to understand what sort of
pressure is being placed on me by the public,'' he told Itzik, the
Israeli environment minister.
</P>
<P>
   ``My public perceives Hezbollah to be heroes who succeeded in
getting the IDF (Israel Defense Forces) out of Lebanon and believe
that that is the route we should take as well.'' He also stressed
that he was also under pressure from the Arab world to follow
Hezbollah's example.
</P>
<P>
   ``My situation is not simple,'' Arafat added, ``The pressure
being applied on me is coming from every direction. The Palestinian
people want to see results in terms of the release of prisoners. In
practice they see that nothing is moving.''
</P>
<P>
   This may be a ploy to bounce Israel into offering more
concessions during talks, due to be transferred back to the Middle
East from Stockholm. In this, the message is clear: If Ehud Barak,
Israel's premier, and his team continue to play hard ball, then the
process could collapse as the Palestinian public will not tolerate
more long delays and feeble results.
</P>
<P>
   The Jerusalem Post reported Tuesday that the Palestinian leader
has written to Bill Clinton complaining about the state of the
talks _ which he said were in an impasse _ and asking the U.S.
president to push for progress.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton will have a chance of relaying these sentiments when he
meets Barak Thursday in Germany.
</P>
<P>
   But, while the Palestinians are unlikely to return to an armed
struggle to end the Israeli occupation of the lands, Arafat has
real cause to be worried about hardening public opinion.
</P>
<P>
   There is no doubt that the TV pictures from Lebanon of Hezbollah
celebrations at the end of Israel's 22-year occupation _ watched
joyously both by Palestinians in the occupied territories and
Israel's 1.2 million Arabs _ were embarrassing to him and his team.
</P>
<P>
   His dilemma has been deepened by being the target of criticism
from Hezbollah's leader, Sheikh Hassan Nasrallah, who told al-Wasat
newspaper that he believed ``that the Palestine Question can't be
settled in the way matters are being dealt with at the moment.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The struggle of the Palestinian people has been going on for
more than 50 years,'' he said, ``Fifty years is a long time;
leaderships may grow tired. If so, they must stand aside.
</P>
<P>
   ``But only yesterday,'' he continued, ``we saw on TV how the
youths of Palestine were confronting the Israeli soldiers with
stones. This is a generation that is prepared for sacrifice; a
generation that has not been exhausted despite the difficult and
harsh conditions it is living under.''
</P>
<P>
   Negotiations with Israel have limped along _ another deadline
next month is sure to be missed _ producing few results that
satisfy Palestinian demands.
</P>
<P>
   Barak has proved a master at presenting himself on the
international arena as a peacemaker, but Jewish settlement building
has continued on the West Bank. He tends to characterize any offers
to the Palestinians as ``concessions.''
</P>
<P>
   Arafat has not found Barak easy to deal with, as another remark
to Itzak revealed. ``Oh, how I miss Yitzhak Rabin. With him, a
fight was a fight, and spat was a spat, a date was a date and a
word was a word.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, as the example of Hezbollah looms over him, life is harder
still for the aging Palestinian leader. In the past, Arafat _ who
has some 17 security organizations attached to his Palestinian
Authority _ has ruthlessly cracked down on internal dissent. From
now on, it may not be quite so easy. &QL;

 &HT;    WILL WELFARE BE USED TO COERCE KEY VOTES IN HISTORIC MEXICAN
ELECTION?
 &HT;    (550&AMP;ADD)
 &HT;    By SUSAN FERRISS 
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ A month before the most bitterly fought
presidential election in Mexico's recent history, the ruling party
is under increasing fire for using federal welfare programs to lure
or coerce votes for its candidate.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Mexican President Ernesto Zedillo told farmers in
Morelos state that subsidies and other assistance ``get to where
they need to get, to your hands, without intermediaries,
bureaucrats or political manipulation.''
</P>
<P>
   Zedillo's comments seemed designed to quell complaints that some
bureaucrats are threatening to withhold subsidies to the poor
unless recipients pledge to vote for Mexico's 71-year-old
Institutional Revolutionary Party, the PRI, on July 2.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to Zedillo's speech, however, a top campaign advisor
to the PRI's candidate bluntly said in a national magazine article
published last Sunday that the PRI is ``at war'' and will use those
programs to fight to keep power.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, federal social programs are carried out by the PRI, and
their aim is to win the presidency,'' said veteran PRI politician
Manuel Bartlett, who joined the campaign of PRI candidate Francisco
Labastida Ochoa shortly after it was widely perceived that
Labastida had lost a nationally televised debate in April.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have no reason to deny it . . . ,'' Bartlett told Milenio
magazine. ``We are at war and if the public employees there are PRI
sympathizers they should defend the party.''
</P>
<P>
   Bartlett, a former Puebla state governor, ran unsuccessfully
against Labastida in a PRI primary election last year. He is
considered one of the old-fashioned PRI strongmen called
``dinosaurs.'' Although Bartlett denies it, he is widely suspected
of using his position as a cabinet member in charge of elections in
1988 to engineer fraud on behalf of the PRI's then-presidential
candidate.
</P>
<P>
   The PRI, which has controlled Mexico's presidency for seven
decades, has a history of doling out gifts of food and building
supplies to the poor before elections.
</P>
<P>
   This year's race comes in the wake of democratic reforms to make
elections fairer and cleaner. But opposition parties say they are
still concerned about PRI activists in remote areas attempting to
coerce votes by threatening to cut government subsidies.
</P>
<P>
   About 30 percent of Mexican voters live in rural areas, which
are a stronghold of PRI support.
</P>
<P>
   One program under scrutiny is Progresa, a family welfare program
started by Zedillo in 1997 that offers cash payments to poor
mothers who keep their children in school.
</P>
<P>
   More than 2.6 million families _ 14 million individuals _ are
enrolled in the program. Several publications in Mexico have
reported complaints by women in rural Veracruz and Chiapas states
that program promoters are warning them to vote for the PRI or
their benefits will be cut.
</P>
<P>
   Labastida aide Javier Trevino challenged critics to prove that
manipulation of social programs has really happened.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't stop investing in social programs,'' he said, just
because an election is about to happen.
</P>
<P>
   He added that Labastida campaign's position is that ``we don't
need any kind of support of activities outside the law.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe what (Bartlett) was referring to is that the government
of President Zedillo has made a commitment to the Mexican people
with these programs,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Recent surveys have found that about 40 percent of recipients of
federal subsidy and welfare benefits identify them with the PRI and
not the government.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, opposition politicians in the state of Mexico
discovered a storage area rented by a local PRI-dominated
government that was filled with construction materials a PRI
candidate was handing out to poor farmers in the area.
</P>
<P>
   Prior to that, the PRI was fined $125,000 because its mayoral
candidate, Jesus Silva-Herzog, a former ambassador to the United
States, was handing out government-owned milk in containers with
his photo and the party emblem.
</P>
<P>
   Silva was not found personally guilty because the incident
occurred in February before he had officially registered his
candidacy.

COMPUTERS QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (Circuits)  
 By J.D. BIERSDORFER    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. Many students entering college are being warned that their
personal computers must have ISA/PCI Ethernet adapters and that
networked PC's must be equipped with 10Base-T Ethernet adapter
cards, cables and communications software. What do these terms
mean?
</P>
<P>
   A. Many of those terms relate to networking _ specifically, to
getting the computer onto the university network.
</P>
<P>
   Although standards vary, most major colleges and universities
have Ethernet networks, which provide much faster connections to
the Internet than does access through a typical dial-up Internet
service provider.
</P>
<P>
   Ethernet is a local area network protocol that was first
developed in the 1970s and is now one of the most common networking
methods used by corporations and colleges. Many types of computers
can use it, including Windows PC's and Macintosh machines.
</P>
<P>
   Ethernet can transmit data at up to 10 million bits per second,
which is much faster than a 56K (56 kilobits per second) modem.
</P>
<P>
   The term ``10BaseT'' refers to the specific type of Ethernet
network and the cables it uses to connect the computer to that
network. Newer versions, called Fast Ethernet, can transfer data at
speeds up to 100 million bits per second and are also referred to
as 100BaseT networks.
</P>
<P>
   The ability to connect to Ethernet networks is not standard in
some computers.
</P>
<P>
   Most new Macs come with built-in Ethernet capability, but
computers running Windows usually need an Ethernet adapter card
installed. Some computer manufacturers will sell you a machine with
the card already installed, or you can buy an adapter card from a
computer store.
</P>
<P>
   ISA/PCI refers to the slot on the computer's motherboard that
the card snaps into.
</P>
<P>
   Older computers usually have ISA slots, but the PCI standard has
become the norm in newer machines. The Ethernet card should come
with the software that will let the PC communicate with the
network. You can also find the proper Ethernet cables at your local
computer store. The cable packaging may refer to the cables as
having ``RJ-45'' connectors, which is just a reference to the plug
type on each end.
</P>
<P>
   As far as the communications software requirements, these will
probably vary even more depending on the particular college and the
computing platform (Windows or Macintosh). Most colleges will
provide on request the specific information for what they prefer.
</P>
<P>
   You might try looking at the college's Web site for the
preferred standards, as well as at a Frequently Asked Questions
section focusing on hardware and software standards. If your future
freshman doesn't yet have a computer to take to school, you might
also ask if the campus bookstore or an affiliated outlet sells the
approved equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Is there any way I can tell what Web sites do with the
personal information I give them?
</P>
<P>
   A. Most commercial Web sites that ask for personal information
have a link to their privacy policy at the bottom of the home page,
which should tell you what the site is doing with your data and who
the site might share the information with.
</P>
<P>
   Although it is not a complete record of all the Web sites out
there, Enonymous.com's analysts have a database rating privacy
practices of 30,000 sites at www.privacyratings.org.
</P>
<P>
   The site offers a directory of sites that have high privacy
ratings, and you can check to see if a particular site has been
rated by typing its URL into a box on the Privacy Ratings page.
</P>
<P>
   There are a number of good sites for general information on
online privacy, including legislative measures.
</P>
<P>
   If you want to keep up on the issues, try the Electronic Privacy
Information Center (www.epic.org), the Online Privacy Alliance
(www.privacyalliance.org) or Americans for Computer Privacy
(www.computerprivacy.org).

   When it comes to buying plants, I don't like to order them on
the Web. If it's something simple I'm after, like more purple
coneflowers or a couple of Miss Kim lilacs, I'll head for a
favorite nursery and wander down those aisles of trees, shrubs and
perennials. I flirt with all kinds of plants I don't need, touching
the leaves, sizing up their height, branching, color and general
health. I open their jaws and look at their teeth. I spend a lot of
money on things I didn't come for.
</P>
<P>
   But that's part of the joy of gardening. It's easy enough to
spend money on the Internet, but you don't experience any of these
sensual pleasures. In fact, too often, it feels like work. There I
am on some gorgeous day, hunched over my desk, clicking my mouse,
straining my eyes at a rather blurry picture of Hydrangea
paniculata Tardiva, which I want, desperately. I add the $19
bareroot Hydrangea to my ``wheelbarrow'' and continue down the
list.
</P>
<P>
   The oakleaf hydrangea, for $13.50, looks pretty good, but it's
out of stock. I continue on, wearily. If I'm going to get
repetitive stress injury, I'd rather get it from pruning the privet
than from clicking a mouse.
</P>
<P>
   I'd much rather be thumbing back and forth through a favorite
catalog, drinking coffee on the porch, than clicking little icons
into my shopping cart. Granted, it is faster to order a long list
of roses, bulbs or seeds on the Web _ you don't even have to add up
your subtotal _ but many of my favorite mail order companies have
yet to get their Web sites up and running. For instance, when I
used a search engine to find Cricket Hill Garden, which grows
exquisite tree peonies, I was linked in less than a minute to the
garden's home page, www.treepeony.com. But when I tried to ``enter
the garden,'' the Netscape meteors just kept flying over the planet
in the icon box _ always a bad sign _ until the notice appeared:
``The server could be down or is not responding.''
</P>
<P>
   Most gardeners feel the way I do. According to the National
Gardening Association, 67 million households spent $30 billion on
lawn and garden products last year. Only 2 percent, or $160
million, was spent online.
</P>
<P>
   ``More than 90 percent go to retail outlets,'' said Bruce
Butterfield, the director of research at the association. Direct
marketing _ selling goods through not just the Internet but also
through catalogs and magazines _ only accounts for 7 percent of the
$30 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Why is that? Because buying a plant is like buying a peach.
</P>
<P>
   ``You want to pick it up, squeeze it, see what she is,''
Butterfield said.
</P>
<P>
   No matter how you order a plant _ by catalog or online _
shipping it live is tricky. Even the most reputable nursery, like
Heirloom Roses in St. Paul, Ore., cannot rule out a flood, a
drought, a sudden freeze or a gardener called out of town when 13
roses need to be unpacked and planted in two-foot-holes full of
compost with perfect drainage.
</P>
<P>
   Which is why I go to a good local nursery for all but the rare
plants I have to order elsewhere. For something really hard to
find, I choose a reputable grower or seed company, and order online
or by telephone or mail. (It hardly matters to the plant which
one.)
</P>
<P>
   Granted, as soon as the good nurseries get their Web sites
running smoothly, ordering online will be a nifty addition to the
joy of poring over the catalogs from those same companies. You can
just run inside for 10 minutes and click your mouse a few hundred
times and be done with it. You can see what's out of stock _ and
what has been added almost daily. So that will be good, if you
garden like a day trader.
</P>
<P>
   Online browsing, not shopping, has put the heat on retail
outlets.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the unintended consequences has been that customers
will go to Garden.com, print out a list of 27 varieties of hostas,
take it to the garden center and say, `I want this blue one,'''
Butterfield said.
</P>
<P>
   In the old days, they did the same thing with the Sears &AMP;
Roebuck catalog. ``It challenges retail to have more variety,'' he
said. ``It broadens people's horizons. But it's got to be hell for
the retailers. People say, `I saw this 12-pocket strawberry jar
with a rolled rim sold by Kinsman &AMP; Co. How come you don't have
it?'''
</P>
<P>
   That strawberry jar is an example of the real riches on the Web.
The Web's potential as a research tool is infinite. Wondering how
to compost? Go to some search engine and type in ``compost.'' Or
``compost'' and ``soil.'' On their Web sites, the New York
Botanical Garden and the Brooklyn Botanic Garden explain all you
need to know to get started. The more scientific minded can find a
virtual college course on all the life teeming beneath their feet
in www.soilfoodweb.com.
</P>
<P>
   I got full instructions and a plan for building a bluebird box
by typing ``bluebird society'' in a Google search box, which gave
me the North American Bluebird Society's Web site,
www.nabluebirdsociety.org.
</P>
<P>
   I've hooked up with organic farmers and wildlife biologists in
Maryland by surfing the Web, starting with general agencies, like
the state department of agriculture and the state department of
natural resources, and soon finding links to community service
agriculture, federal subsidies for turning cropland into wildlife
habitats, organic farms run by the state chapter of the National
Audubon Society.
</P>
<P>
   I logged onto the New York Botanical Garden Web site,
www.nybg.org, and found out that Rose Week begins on June 3, and
the Peggy Rockefeller Rose Garden is in peak bloom. But when I
clicked on ``rose garden'' to peruse its list of what's growing
there, I got an error message, which said, ``Sorry, the file you
requested does not exist.'' My temples started throbbing. Then it
occurred to me that I didn't need a list. I could go see real roses
blooming.
</P>
<P>
   You could spend all day indoors, reading articles by your
favorite gardeners, keeping up with their up-to-the-minute
thoughts. On her Web site, www.reneesgarden.com., Renee Shepherd
explains the difference between F-1 hybrids and open-pollinated
seed; she tells you how to plant tomatoes and peppers.
</P>
<P>
   On his Web site, www.cooksgarden.com, Shepherd Ogden, the owner
of the Cooks Garden, in Londonderry, Vt., offers his views on
genetic engineering; he keeps a garden journal on the progress of
his trial beds in Burlington.
</P>
<P>
   Oops, the last entry was April 21. Maybe Ogden is busy gardening
these days.
</P>
<P>
   Which reminds me: 13 bareroot roses are still sitting in my
vegetable garden, waiting for me to dig those really big holes,
full of really good compost, which I learned all about on the Web.
So the virtual gardener had better get real.

<P>
   One way to refinish a kitchen countertop where the plastic
laminate is worn is to resurface it with ceramic tile.
</P>
<P>
   First, check the condition of the laminate carefully. The
surface must be flat, relatively smooth and firmly bonded to the
counter. Once you have determined that the laminate bond is secure,
you can pick out the tiles you want for the counter. Avoid choosing
unglazed, porous tiles or tiles with a high-gloss glaze. Unglazed
tiles stain easily and will be hard to maintain. High-gloss tiles
will scratch.
</P>
<P>
   Ceramic tiles are available in a wide range of sizes and colors.
Most do-it- yourselfers will find that the standard
four-and-a-quarter-inch square ceramic tiles are easiest to work
with because they are a convenient size and they have spacing tabs
to ensure uniform grout joints. To determine how many tiles you
need, calculate the area of the counter top, including the
backsplash, and add 15 percent to cover cutting mistakes, breakage
and spares for future repairs.
</P>
<P>
   You will also need a latex or acrylic thin-set adhesive to bond
the tiles to the counter, and an unsanded grout to fill the gaps
between the tiles. Consult the specifications on the packages to
determine the required amounts for each, or check with the dealer
at the tile store.
</P>
<P>
   It is likely that you will have to cut some tiles and shape
others to fit around the sink opening. You will need a tile cutter
and a nibbler for these tasks. These can be rented from the tile
dealer or from a tool rental store. You will also need a notched
trowel and a grout float.
</P>
<P>
   Start by removing the sink and fixtures. First, shut off the
water supply to the faucets. Then disconnect the supply lines and
remove the fixtures. Loosen the sink tailpiece and the retaining
clips under the sink, then lift the sink from the counter.
</P>
<P>
   Wash the counter top with a mild detergent to remove all dirt
and grease, then sand the surface with 120-grit sandpaper. The
sanding will roughen the laminate surface and create a ''tooth''
for the tile adhesive to bond with. Use a damp cloth to clean all
dust from the surface.
</P>
<P>
   The hardest part of any tile installation is planning the layout
so the tiles will look symmetrical. Since the sink is the focal
point of the counter top, the layout should be centered on it. Lay
a row of tiles along the front edge of the sinkhole, making sure
the row is centered on the sinkhole.
</P>
<P>
   Use a pencil to place a mark on the counter at one end of the
row. This will be the starting point for the layout. Use a framing
square to extend the mark to the backsplash. Lay a row of tiles
along this new line, then repeat this operation on the other side
of the sinkhole.
</P>
<P>
   Next lay a row of tiles around the perimeter of the sink. If
they extend over the sinkhole, mark the overlapping material on the
underside of each tile, then cut them to fit the opening. Use the
tile cutter to cut straight pieces and the nibbler to break away
small portions to fit the corners. You may also have to cut the
tiles that fit against the backsplash.
</P>
<P>
   When all the tiles are cut to size, you can begin the
installation. First, nail a temporary wooden straightedge, called a
batten, to the edge of the counter. This will serve as a guide for
aligning the first row of tiles. Mix the adhesive according to the
package directions, then let the mixture stand for about 15 minutes
to develop stronger bonding power.
</P>
<P>
   Spread the adhesive with the flat side of the trowel, then flip
the trowel over and use the notched side to comb the adhesive in a
uniformly rigid pattern. Begin setting the tiles at the front edge,
starting at your pencil mark; then continue to tile the entire
counter. When you place the tiles along the backsplash, be sure to
align them with the rest of the counter tiles. After all the tiles
are in, place a piece of plywood (about 12 inches by 12 inches) on
top of the tiles and tap the board with a rubber mallet. This will
seat the tiles firmly in the adhesive.
</P>
<P>
   Allow at least 24 hours for the adhesive to set before applying
the grout. Mix the grout according to the package directions and
spread it across the face of the tiles with the grout float. Hold
the float at a shallow angle to force the grout into the gaps
between the tiles. Let the grout set for about 15 minutes, then
wipe away any residue with a damp cloth. When the grout has had
time to dry completely, apply a grout sealer with a small artist's
brush.

HEADING NORTH TO THE WIRELESS FUTURE 
</HEADLINE>
   By PETER H. LEWIS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   STOCKHOLM, Sweden _ The Big Bang of telecommunications is now on
the horizon, the long-awaited moment when a third-generation of
Internet-based mobile phone applications and services will sweep
across the world, changing personal communications in a more
profound way than the arrival of the personal computer changed
computing two decades ago.
</P>
<P>
   At least, that is what they say at Nokia in Finland and at
Ericsson in Sweden, two of the largest makers of wireless
telecommunications equipment in the world. But the third-generation
phones they are talking about, so-called 3G phones, are still
several years away for most of the world, according to research
scientists and wireless services developers here and in Helsinki.
The first-generation analog phones are still in widespread use,
after all, especially in the United States, and the second
generation of digital phones are still gaining in popularity.
</P>
<P>
   When the 3G mobile Internet devices do arrive, they may not even
be recognizable as phones, because voice conversations will be just
one of their many capabilities. In fact, the researchers here do
not even call them phones, preferring instead to call them mobile
communicators or mobile terminals. Eventually they will replace
cell phones, the researchers say, allowing people to tap into a
seemingly endless array of personal services, at any time,
anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   But there are daunting technical, commercial and regulatory
issues to resolve before the Big Bang is reality. Consumers,
especially in the United States, will have to wait through a
succession of interim steps _ requiring a change of phones at each
step, of course _ and wade through a morass of confusing terms and
services to get from 2G to 3G.
</P>
<P>
   There is a seemingly insatiable demand for new mobile Internet
services here in Scandinavia, where most people over the age of 15
carry wireless phones, and in Japan, where more than 20,000 people
a day are signing up for Internet access through their phones. The
new 3G services will roll out first in these areas, where the
``wireless lifestyle'' is already well established. In the United
States, where the Internet is closely associated with the personal
computer and where mobile standards are fragmented, the wireless
future is still slightly out of focus. But, the researchers here
point out, the early years of personal computing were also
confusing and frustrating, yet today the Internet and e-mail have
become indispensable to tens of millions of people.
</P>
<P>
   The key to 3G is speed, the ability to transmit and receive
digital data at rates of about 2 million bits per second, more than
35 times faster than today's fastest dial-up personal computer
modems and more than 200 times the speed of most current handheld
wireless data devices.
</P>
<P>
   At 3G speeds, a pocket-size communicator could zoom beyond
simple voice calls and messaging to include mobile video
conferencing, the routine use of video postcards, the delivery of
CD-quality music, the storage and retrieval of personal
information, as well as potentially endless variations on mobile
electronic commerce, or M-commerce.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just as we did not foresee the development of e-mail, the
World Wide Web or other popular services when the PC was first
introduced, we do not know what services will eventually emerge for
3G,'' said Yrjo Neuvo, executive vice president and chief
technology officer for Nokia's mobile phones division in Helsinki.
``But we do know that they will come faster'' than they did for the
PC, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Shown in nonworking prototype form at Nokia's research center in
Helsinki, the 3G phones are small enough to slip in a pocket. They
will not be held up against the ear as today's cell phones are, but
rather held in the hand and operated either by tapping on the
touch-sensitive screen or by voice commands. The screen will
display icons that represent calendar, address book, stored files
and other information familiar to people who today carry a handheld
computer like a Palm or Pocket PC.
</P>
<P>
   The device will also allow high-speed perusing of the World Wide
Web, modified to be displayed on a small color screen _ Web Lite,
as some people here call it _ as well as instant access to news,
impulse ordering of goods and services, personal banking and stock
trading, multiplayer games, and the ability to send and receive
multimedia messages easily with people all over the world.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike today's crazy quilt of incompatible wireless standards,
which prevent most American cell phones from working elsewhere in
the world and even in different parts of the United States, the
goal of 3G developers is a single, unified global standard, known
as Universal Mobile Telephone System, or UMTS.
</P>
<P>
   Licenses for a handful of 3G installations have already been
granted in Japan and Europe, for astonishing amounts of money.
``This is the second coming for the telecoms companies,'' said
Zaheed Hague, chief executive of Room33.com, a wireless application
developer here. ``They missed the Internet, and this time they
don't want to miss out.''
</P>
<P>
   (MORE)  &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   Like hundreds of companies in Scandinavia, Room33 is focusing on
an interim technology called Wireless Application Protocol, or WAP,
an evolving international standard for delivering Internet data
services and advanced telephony to WAP-enabled phones, pagers,
handheld computers and other wireless devices.
</P>
<P>
   The first WAP-enabled phones are just beginning to show up in
the United States, after a slow start in Europe. Motorola, the
largest American maker of cellular phones, said all of its new
phones will be WAP-capable by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   A somewhat similar but incompatible service called i-Mode is
wildly popular in Japan, attracting more than 7 million users in 15
months. Encouraged by such consumer enthusiasm, hundreds of
companies here are developing WAP applications for everything from
banking and stock trading to ticketing services, control of
industrial robots, Internet search engines and entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Codeonline, a start-up company in Espoo, Finland,
is preparing to introduce a mobile entertainment application that
will let people play trivia games on their WAP phones. PicoFun, a
Stockholm-based startup, has a WAP-based game that lets phone users
compete in fantasy soccer leagues.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of playing games on a phone may be curious to
Americans, where cell phones are still relatively rare compared
with Finland. But at Nokia, down the road in Espoo, executives
proclaim with almost religious fervor that more people worldwide
will be reaching the Internet through wireless devices by 2003 than
through personal computers. This is already the case in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Americans accustomed to browsing the World Wide Web on a big
color computer screen over a high-speed link will find the WAP
browser to be agonizingly slow and spare, with a clumsy,
thumb-controlled user interface and a display that is suitable for
only a few lines of text and perhaps a small crude graphic.
</P>
<P>
   The key to WAP, however, is the development of services that are
exclusively for mobile users who need snippets of information or
who want to make simple transactions or requests from a mobile
handset. It does not require a fancy graphical interface to make a
credit card payment or book a train ticket from a WAP screen, for
example.
</P>
<P>
   Early WAP users in Europe have complained that their wireless
phone bills leap when they use the system, because it takes extra
time to connect to the Internet and navigate through a WAP service.
</P>
<P>
   WAP will really take off, the developers say, when phones make
the transition from today's circuit-switched system, in which the
user has to dial into an Internet service, to a packet-based system
that is always connected to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   In a circuit-switched system, like the one used for most phone
calls today, a private line is established between the caller and
the recipient, and it remains open until the phone is hung up. It
is like having a road reserved just for your car as you drive to
the store and back. The user is typically billed for the length of
time the private circuit is being used.
</P>
<P>
   In a packet-based system, which is the basis of the Internet,
voice and data traffic is broken into chunks of digital bits, or
packets, that travel over a shared common network by taking the
most efficient _ and thus least costly _ route. Using the car
analogy, any number of cars can share your lane, yet you arrive at
your destination just the same. The roads are always open, whether
you are driving or not.
</P>
<P>
   In a packet-based wireless system, the user would pay either
according to the volume of bits that are sent and received, or on a
subscription basis for a fixed monthly fee. The pricing models are
still being decided.
</P>
<P>
   ``The shift from circuit to packet systems is far more
significant to consumers than was the shift from analog to
digital,'' said Bjorn Norhammar, manager of market development for
3G communicators for Ericsson.
</P>
<P>
   This transition to packet-based services is expected to begin
later this year in Europe, through a technology called General
Packet Radio System. Based on 2G networks, GPRS is often called
``two and a half G,'' signaling its status as a step between 2G and
true 3G networks.
</P>
<P>
   Although it is technically feasible that GPRS systems will have
a connection speed of up to 170 kilobits (thousands of bits) per
second, Nokia says the first packet-radio systems will have a
maximum rate of 26 or 39 kbps. Still, that is faster than 2G
phones, generally 9.6 kbps.
</P>
<P>
   A variant of the packet-based system called Cellular Digital
Packet Data, or CDPD, is being introduced in the United States by
AT&AMP;T Wireless Services, under the Digital Pocket Net brand name.
Users of the Pocket Net service have free, unlimited access to
about 40 Web sites for tasks like finding directions, shopping for
books and CD's, trading stocks, making flight reservations and
checking news headlines. However, the Pocket Net system has a speed
limit of about 19 kbps, and is seen as a transition step toward
GPRS, now primarily limited to phones based on European and Asian
standards.
</P>
<P>
   One of the more intriguing features of 3G communicators will be
locality _ that is, the ability for the network to ``know'' where
the user is whenever the phone is on. Location-based services are
being developed here, for example, to notify a subscriber to an
online dating service whenever another subscriber who matches a
certain profile is nearby.
</P>
<P>
   Or, a subscriber could sign up for a service that allows shops
or restaurants beam the digital equivalent of discount coupons to
the mobile device whenever the 3G customer is in the area. In
another example, a 3G device installed in a car would enable the
police to track it down if the car was stolen. Obviously, many
privacy issues remain to be resolved.
</P>
<P>
   Although 3G communicators are still years away, researchers here
are hard at work on 4G, which promises data rates of 100 megabits
per second _ sufficient for video teleconferencing _ and wireless
networking with televisions, garage door openers and other devices
using a technology called Bluetooth. But when Nokia officials were
setting up a computer presentation on Bluetooth and other future
mobile technologies, they still had to fumble with cables and wait
for Windows to boot up.
</P>
<P>
   ``If our phones took as long to turn on as Windows,'' Martin
Sandelin, a senior vice president at Nokia, said with a sigh, ``we
wouldn't make as many phone calls.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   It can be seen as the beginning of modern New York _ of
monumental scale, of structural steel _ or the end of old
Brooklyn,'' David McCullough wrote at the conclusion of his epic
history ``The Great Bridge'' (Simon &AMP; Schuster, 1972). ``It is all
these. And possibly its enduring appeal may rest on its physical
solidity and permanence, the very reverse of rootlessness. It says,
perhaps as does nothing else built by Americans before or since,
that we had come to stay.''
</P>
<P>
   Even McCullough's classic work, and the Ken Burns documentary
``Brooklyn Bridge,'' cannot fully capture the lore behind what has
become a national icon since it opened in 1883. Several Web sites
offer looks at the history and myths of the bridge, in both words
and photographs.
</P>
<P>
   Great Buildings Online has a collection of photographs, some new
and in color, some more than a century old
(www.greatbuildings.com/buildings/Brooklyn(underscore)Bridge.html).
There is a 1905 panorama of the East River and the Manhattan
skyline below and above the Brooklyn Bridge, and there is a modern
Quick Time color panorama that allows a viewer to scan 360 degrees
from one of the abutments.
</P>
<P>
   There is also a color poster for sale, showing the bridge and a
modern skyline in a purple dusk. Also on the site is an elevation
of the bridge and the river drawn by John Roebling, the designer of
the bridge, which was built by his son, Washington Roebling.
</P>
<P>
   The site also enables downloading of a simple 3-D exterior
architectural model of the bridge.
</P>
<P>
   The Brooklyn Bridge Web site
(www.endex.com/gf/buildings/bbridge/bbridge.html) has a summary of
facts about the bridge: engineering milestones, traffic flow and
strength data, construction fatalities, even information about its
opening ceremonies. There are directions for tourists, information
about the cavernous land-based anchorages, timelines about the
bridge, advertisements for walking tours and a 24-hour Web camera
fixed on the bridge (romdog.com/bridge/brooklyn2-.html). The site
also has a collection of historical photographs.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the best online resource on the bridge is the archive of
the John A. Roebling's Sons Co.
(www.inventionfactory.com/history/main.html), which supplied the
steel wire for the bridge and which revolutionized bridge design.
The Roebling family company was a major industry in Trenton for
more than 100 years before closing in the 1970s (the factory site
is being redeveloped, and its machine shop is being turned into a
museum), and the company's archives were put online with the help
of the New Jersey Council on the Humanities.
</P>
<P>
   Besides supplying the suspension wire for the Brooklyn, George
Washington and Golden Gate bridges, Roebling's was also the main
supplier of wire for the Slinky toy in the 1950s, said Ray
Dallavecchia, president of James Industries, the Slinky's
manufacturer.
</P>
<P>
   Dallavecchia passed that information along from Tom James, whose
father, Richard James, invented the Slinky. ``Richard and Betty
James were personal friends of Mary Roebling, the granddaughter of
John Roebling,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Yet for all the information available online, there is little
about the lore of ``buying the Brooklyn Bridge.''
</P>
<P>
   McCullough's book notes the influence of Boss Tweed in the early
years of the bridge (Tweed's ring was broken up before it could do
too much financial or physical damage to the project) and the many
bitter public debates connected with the shifting of the bridge
from private to public ownership. It also reports the occasional
charges of fraud in billing for materials.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow, the bridge became the symbol of the ultimate con game.
``Nobody really knows where it comes from,'' McCullough said in a
telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it's suspected that it comes from the confusion over who
owned it, whether it was Brooklyn or New York who owned the bridge.
And since the bridge is the most conspicuous symbol of New York and
all its grandeur and accomplishment, the easiest way for tricking
the rube would be selling the Brooklyn Bridge.''

UNLIKE VIRUSES, BACTERIA FIND A WELCOME IN THE WORLD OF COMPUTING 
</HEADLINE>
   By ANNE EISENBERG    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Can living cells be transformed into computers? A number of
researchers are betting that the answer is yes. They are trying to
use DNA, in and out of actual living cells, that can add, subtract,
store results and run programs.
</P>
<P>
   If they succeed, silicon and the microchips it made possible may
one day be replaced by bacteria that can handle computing. Such
biological computers could be able to handle very large numbers of
analytical steps simultaneously, a process called parallel
computing, and might be able to do that cheaply.
</P>
<P>
   Not quite yet, though. While scientists seek to hijack the
biological controls already present in cells and reprogram them for
their own purposes, no one knows how to get a billion or so cells
talking to one another in a controlled fashion.
</P>
<P>
   But a few advances have been made in this new crossover field in
science, part of a new area called biological computing, or
biocomputing. While biocomputing includes ways to do rudimentary
computing with DNA itself, scientists have begun looking at ways to
do computations in whole cells by engineering part of the cells'
DNA and the machinery controlled by those genes.
</P>
<P>
   For example, scientists have used genes to build a biological
toggle switch, which corresponds to a fundamental element in
computers, and a rudimentary clock. Such biological clocks might
someday mimic the clocks that synchronize various programs in
computers.
</P>
<P>
   A start-up company has even been set up to create what its
founders call ``genetic applets,'' pieces of DNA that handle
functions analogous to those handled by pieces of computer code.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the work on DNA-based computing is being done by
computer scientists, physicists, mathematicians and engineers who
have never taken a graduate biology class but have learned on the
job. Many of these scientists are finding that research in the dry
world of silicon has not prepared them for the uncertainties of a
``wet'' laboratory, where their mathematical models need to come
alive.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is nanotechnology in a wetter form, namely in a living
cell,'' said Dr. James Collins, a professor of biomedical
engineering at Boston University who is a physicist by training and
has become a leader in biocomputing. ``We are probably decades away
from having a jar of bacteria computing on your desk, but we are
nearing the point where you can have cells programmed for different
functions, and therefore be considered as computing devices.''
</P>
<P>
   Collins and his colleagues have in fact demonstrated it is
possible to program cells by injecting new gene networks engineered
from strips of DNA into the cells so that the cells respond to
changes in their environment in ways that could one day be useful
for computations. The mechanisms are slow and cumbersome _ on the
order of minutes, if not hours, and as much as a billion times
slower than the computations of current electronic computers. But
it is early days in the world of genetic circuits.
</P>
<P>
   At Boston University, a step toward a future of synthetic,
programmable gene circuits was taken about two years ago by Collins
and Dr. Timothy Gardner, who was a graduate student in Collins'
group at the time and coined the term genetic applets.
</P>
<P>
   Collins' laboratory wanted to create the biological version of a
basic element in a digital circuit, the on-off toggle.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were looking for the equivalent of a light switch to flip
processes on or off in the cell,'' Gardner said. ``Then I realized
a way to do this with genes instead of with electric circuits.''
</P>
<P>
   The idea meshed with the mathematical modeling the researchers
were doing to predict how switches would behave in the world of
living cells, where responses are often not the simple, predictable
ones of a linear system. ``We created a nonlinear model and made
some predictions about how the switch would behave in a cell,''
Gardner said. ``Then basically there was nothing left to do except
build it.''
</P>
<P>
   The idea was to engineer a circular section of DNA with two
genes that inhibit each other, so the first gene is on while the
second one is off, and vice versa. Those states can be thought of
as a zero or 1, just as a silicon switch is on or off. The gene
network is prodded to switch from one state to the other by a dose
of a particular chemical or a change of temperature. If the cell is
given enough of the chemical, for instance, the inactive gene will
turn on; by turning on, it turns off the other gene.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, like many scientists in this crossover field, Gardner
has had scant formal preparation in biology (one molecular biology
class taken as a college sophomore). ``Most biologists thought I
was crazy,'' he said. But at least one did not: Dr. Charles Cantor,
a molecular biologist at Boston University and a leader of the
Human Genome Project. He thought that the idea was promising and
lent laboratory space and guidance.
</P>
<P>
   Within a year, Gardner had built the switch _ fragments of DNA
cut and pasted together and inserted into a bacterial cell, where
the switch worked just fine. The results were reported in the
journal Nature in January.
</P>
<P>
   Other laboratories working on related problems in cell
computation and the design of genetic networks include that of Dr.
Stanislas Leibler at Princeton University, where Dr. Michael
Elowitz devised a type of biological clock that will work within a
cell. Elowitz worked on the project as a graduate student and is
now a postdoctoral fellow at Rockefeller University.
</P>
<P>
   The system consists of four genes put into a bacterium; Elowitz
calls it a genetic circuit. Each of the first three genes inhibits
the activity of the next gene down the line. The fourth gene
controls the production of a fluorescent protein, so the pulses of
fluorescence indicate the periodic output of the clock.
</P>
<P>
   Elowitz said the output could be viewed as ``something like the
hands of a watch.'' But the biological clock shows a good deal of
variation, or signal noise, he said, so it may need more elaborate
molecular controls. ``We are working on the source of the noise,''
he said. The results of the research are reported in a January
issue of the journal Nature.
</P>
<P>
   While Elowitz's project is still in the laboratory stage,
Gardner and Collins have started a company called Cellicon
Biotechnologies. The name is taken from the words cell and control
and the word silicon, the material the technology may one day
usurp. While their biological switch and extensions of it could
have a future in biocomputing, they said such switches could have
immediate results in gene therapy.
</P>
<P>
   The current commercial techniques for activating therapeutic
genes require the continual application of a drug to keep the gene
active. If a drug could be used to flip a genetic switch to the on
position, and that switch could then turn on the gene that is
needed by the patient, the gene would presumably stay on until
another drug or other signal was used to switch it off. ``With the
toggle, which only requires transient delivery to switch the system
from off to on,'' Collins said, ``you would only need to take a
drug once, removing the dependence on sustained drug ingestion.''
</P>
<P>
   Most applications of biological computing are far in the future.
The old-fashioned, silicon-based electronic way is certainly not
threatened yet, and it is in fact integral to the analytical
calculations, modeling and simulations that many of the
scientists-turned-biologists do before they get down to bench work.
But one day there may indeed be that unlikely thing, computers in a
flask, and even injectable cells that will travel through the body
to help the patient.
</P>
<P>
   After all, if cells can be made to compute at scientists'
bidding, instead of doing just the computing that nature intended,
biological problems are the ones that cells are most suited to
solve.

VIETNAM MEMORIAL HAS VIRTUAL TWIN 
</HEADLINE>
  
(ATTN: Minn., Mass.)  By MIKE RENSHAW    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The day Kim Vogelsang was born, her father was buried.
</P>
<P>
   Ten days before, on June 6, 1969, Pfc. John Kim Vogelsang, a
soldier from Minnesota, had been killed in action while serving
with the First Cavalry Division in South Vietnam. He was 23.
</P>
<P>
   She was named after him. But over the years, it was difficult to
learn much about him.
</P>
<P>
   ``While my mother and I have always been very close, it was just
too traumatic for her to talk about him,'' Vogelsang said. ``She
rarely ever went to his grave.''
</P>
<P>
   It was not until Vogelsang's career as an assistant to a
Broadway producer brought her to Manhattan that she began trying to
learn about the father she never met.
</P>
<P>
   About two years ago she turned to the Internet and, in that
unending maze of Web sites and hyperlinks, discovered the Virtual
Wall, the cyberspace equivalent of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has been absolutely amazing,'' Vogelsang said. ``I'm in
touch with several Vietnam veterans who served with my father's
unit. They've drawn maps of my father's base camp and brought me
into a world that was part of his life.''
</P>
<P>
   Each year, about 2 million people visit the Vietnam memorial,
the black granite wall, built in 1982, that contains the names of
58,220 American men and women killed in the war. Its Internet twin,
the Virtual Wall (www.thevirtualwall.org), is recording about 1
million hits a month.
</P>
<P>
   The site includes information about the real wall and a
traveling replica, an image gallery and a link to the home page of
the Vietnam Veterans Memorial Fund. But the main feature is the
virtual wall itself: Each of the 140 granite panels of the real
wall can be viewed. And when a visitor clicks on a name, a pop-up
screen appears with the person's name, date of birth, rank and date
of death, along with links to any audio, image or text files
provided by friends or relatives.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the files are tributes to the dead. Others are questions
from family members seeking information about the last moments of
their loved ones or from members of the same unit trying to find
former comrades in arms. From Vietnam come pleas for information
from children who were fathered by American military personnel.
</P>
<P>
   The site is the result of a connection between Jan C. Scruggs,
president of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial Fund, and Nathan Kantor,
chief executive of Winstar Communications, a wireless broadband
company.
</P>
<P>
   ``I met Jan Scruggs when he came to me for financial help for
the Vietnam Memorial,'' Kantor recalled. When Kantor, a West Point
graduate, became a board member of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial
Fund in 1995, he used the talents of his Internet Webmaster and
designers to transport the Vietnam Memorial to cyberspace. Scruggs
credits Winstar with the technological success of the Virtual Wall.
</P>
<P>
   The site is undergoing some refinements, including the addition
of chat rooms. One eventual goal is to post a photograph of every
one of the dead.
</P>
<P>
   There is no advertising on the site. ``That's not what this is
about,'' Kantor said. ``This is something we do because it's the
right thing to do.''
</P>
<P>
   The Virtual Wall serves men like Ron McClain of Wales, Mass. On
May 1, 1968, he was serving with the Ninth Infantry Division in the
Mekong Delta when he stepped on a land mine.
</P>
<P>
   With serious damage to both legs, he returned to the United
States and lost contact with the soldiers he had served with.
Having served in the Army as a medic, he dedicated himself to a
career as a nurse.
</P>
<P>
   Like so many others, McClain went to the Virtual Wall to find
those he had served with and perhaps heal the psychic scars left by
his experience in Vietnam. McClain linked his own Web site to the
Virtual Wall; his Web site
(community-2.webtv.net/DocII/VIETNAMRECOLLECTIONS) lists the names
of men in his unit who were killed _ many of whom he tried to help
_ and of survivors who served with him.
</P>
<P>
   Through his site, McClain made connections. He received warm
e-mail messages and set up reunions with some old friends. One
fellow veteran told McClain that he had recently visited the
location of their old base camp in Vietnam and found that it had
been turned into a snake farm.
</P>
<P>
   So why does McClain search for his friends of more than 30 years
ago?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's about reaching back and trying to reconnect with only
those who know what it was like,'' he said. ``The main thing I ask
those guys is, `What do you think really happened there?'''
</P>
<P>
   Vogelsang seems to have found answers to some of her questions.
</P>
<P>
   Her search has put her in contact with Sons and Daughters in
Touch, an organization for survivors of those killed in action.
Today, one of her closest friends is Mara DeMay, whose father, John
DeMay, is No. 23-W on the wall. Vogelsang's father is No. 24-W.
They met through Sons and Daughters in Touch and will be together
at the Vietnam Veterans Memorial on Father's Day.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have become very close,'' Vogelsang said, ``and without
these relationships, there is no way I would have healed this
much.''
</P>
<P>
   This is what she posted on the Virtual Wall under her father's
name:
</P>
<P>
   ``In the most literal sense, I have never met my father. We
missed each other by 10 days. He never even knew if I was a boy or
a girl. But I can feel how much of him is alive in me. We have the
same eyes, I am told, and the same favorite ice cream flavor
(burgundy cherry). And with the help of veterans who have been
willing to share their stories, and my brothers and sisters at Sons
and Daughters in Touch, I am finally feeling like he is part of my
life.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Kurt Masur and the New York Philharmonic ended
another season at Avery Fisher Hall June 3 with Mahler's Ninth
Symphony, one of the great valedictory works in the symphonic
repertory. And indeed, goodbyes might seem to be in order, as talk
in musical circles centers increasingly on who will replace Masur
as the orchestra's music director.
</P>
<P>
   Philharmonic representatives traveled to Milan recently to talk
terms with Riccardo Muti, and other candidates are said to be
waiting in the wings. But often lost in the seeming confusion of
the last year or so has been the fact that whoever is selected, the
72-year-old Masur, who has done so much to restore the orchestra to
a lofty international standard of performance since taking it over
in 1991, is to remain in place for two more seasons.
</P>
<P>
   This imposing and politically savvy maestro, who played a
significant role in the downfall of the East German regime, is
surely no one's idea of a lame duck, and few have ever found it
wise to underestimate his determination, staying power or
resilience. Yet his ebullience seems to have faded a bit during
years of battles with the Philharmonic management.
</P>
<P>
   To a visitor who had not spoken to him at length for years, he
seemed subdued in a conversation in his Avery Fisher Hall studio
the other day, as he reflected on his achievements in New York and
discussed the future. This year he also becomes the principal
conductor of the London Philharmonic, and in 2002, he exchanges one
music directorship for another, taking over the Orchestre National
de France in Paris.
</P>
<P>
   ``The major point for me is still the New York Philharmonic,
because I don't want to leave as someone who says, `I'll say
goodbye poco a poco, diminuendo,''' Masur said, giving a musical
twist to the fate of MacArthur's old soldiers. ``This I never can
do, because we are too close together. The players are expecting
that I will fight till the last day.''
</P>
<P>
   Fight with them as well as for them, one suspects, given the
tempestuous nature of some of Masur's rehearsals over the years,
especially the early ones. His tone of voice made clear that he
does not intend to disappoint them.
</P>
<P>
   Justifiably, Masur, whose annual salary is about $1.3 million,
takes great satisfaction in the orchestra's improvement over the
last decade. What Zubin Mehta left behind was a group loaded with
talent, largely because of his many superb hires, but seemingly
bereft of morale. Although Masur has hired wonderful players
himself, including Carter Brey as principal cellist and Sheryl
Staples as associate concertmaster, his greatest feat may have been
to instill the needed spirit, pride and sense of discipline among
the players.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, this was not a one-time feat but something that had
to be maintained, as became apparent when the orchestra repeatedly
lapsed into old bad habits under lenient guest conductors; it still
does so on occasion.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I would like to leave behind is this kind of feeling
responsible,'' Masur said, ``this kind of pride to be a member of
the New York Philharmonic, to be a member of one of the leading
orchestras of the world, as it is now without a doubt, so that the
ups and downs are not so dependent on the music director or the
director or the board or the money they have.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew my goals exactly when I came, and it was not easy with
the orchestra at the beginning. But as they learned that I was open
to them, they started to trust me. We have grown together, and this
is the most wonderful thing I have achieved.''
</P>
<P>
   In this sense, his greatest satisfaction may have led to his
greatest disappointment. ``It disturbed some people,'' Masur said.
``I was criticized for being too close to the orchestra. Where else
should I be as a conductor? My disappointments are not in any
direction toward the orchestra. Absolutely not. My disappointment
is that it was possible that with a change of chairman of the
board, the whole politics of the Philharmonic turned around 180
degrees.''
</P>
<P>
   This was as close as Masur came to naming names. Stephen Stamas,
who had been the chairman of the orchestra since 1989, was replaced
by the present chairman, Paul B. Guenther, in 1996. Deborah Borda
was then the executive director of the Philharmonic, having arrived
shortly after Masur in 1991; she left last December to become
managing director of the Los Angeles Philharmonic. The resulting
vacancy has just been filled by Zarin Mehta, the executive director
of the Ravinia Festival and Zubin Mehta's younger brother.
</P>
<P>
   Masur's relationship with Philharmonic management through the
years has been at least as stormy as his relationship with the
players ever was. The final battle became public in early 1998,
when the board refused to extend his contract the usual three
seasons ahead. It was agreed that Masur would stay until 2002 but
that a search for a successor would begin immediately.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a raw deal with some people,'' Masur said. ``Decisions
were made by three or four people.'' Masur's view that he got a raw
deal is widely shared among players as well as the public. Not that
he finds much comfort in such support.
</P>
<P>
   ``It bothers me that this is a free country, and a lot of people
don't feel free,'' he said. ``They come to me and say, `I'm so
sorry about what happened, but I have no power.' Maybe they should
have gone through the school we went through in East Germany. You
had no power, but you had to be brave. And it makes you proud if
you always try to say what you think and to say what you believe is
useful.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   At the very least, the timing of the board's action was awkward,
for Masur had resigned his longtime position as Kapellmeister of
the Leipzig Gewandhaus Orchestra just a year before, ostensibly to
devote himself more fully to New York. The conductorial world was
not rich in obvious candidates to succeed him, and the Philharmonic
did not seem to have anyone particular in mind: certainly no one,
it may be said two years later, whom it could pin down quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever will happen to the Philharmonic was, in my opinion,
not planned very carefully,'' Masur said. ``I was ready to stay
longer. I was ready to go earlier if we found the right person,
just to keep things going as they should go. And at the moment we
are a little bit between two chairs, as we say in Germany.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a wonderful achievement of the board that we have a lot
of money. We can do nearly everything, and we can do everything in
an artistic way. On the other hand, it could have been a closer,
more open cooperation. This is my only disappointment, that I found
some people who are simply not honest, only looking for their
interests, their power.''
</P>
<P>
   Guenther, for his part, said, ``If you look at the history of
the New York Philharmonic, we have had very few music directors who
have served much longer than a decade.'' Zubin Mehta, at 13 years,
served the longest tenure in this century.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our philosophy is that for a dynamic institution like the
Philharmonic, change is often necessary, and this was one of those
times,'' Guenther continued guardedly. ``Kurt Masur has done a
spectacular job.''
</P>
<P>
   Philharmonic administrators have also expressed dissatisfaction
with perceived limitations in Masur's repertory, which leans
heavily toward the Germanic.
</P>
<P>
   So what remains for Masur to accomplish?
</P>
<P>
   He has evidently given up one of his cherished goals: to see a
pipe organ installed in Avery Fisher Hall. Although such an option
exists in current planning for renovation of the building along
with others in Lincoln Center, it seems to be largely theoretical,
for the ample cost has not been included in figures bandied about
to date.
</P>
<P>
   But Masur is still hopeful about setting up a summer home for
the orchestra in the Seventh Regiment Armory, across Central Park
from Lincoln Center, and establishing a series of informal,
adventurous concerts modeled after the London Proms, to attract,
especially, a young audience. Although complex negotiations with
the various parties controlling the building have repeatedly bogged
down, they evidently remain alive.
</P>
<P>
   ``My last goal, even if it doesn't occur until I go away, will
be to do the first concert,'' Masur said, ``an open concert in
whatever condition the hall will be in in summertime, to prove that
young people will come with the right programming.''

 &HT;    BRITISH UNHAPPY OVER US THEFT OF 'THEIR' WAR STORY; WHAT OF
POLES?
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (i) international categories for
release Sunday, June 4.
 &HT;    By JEFF NESMITH and BARTOSZ WEGLARCZYK
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ London newspapers are up in arms over the movie
``U-571'' because it changes history and has U.S. commandos
capturing a German submarine and a priceless encoding machine, when
in fact the feat was performed by British sailors.
</P>
<P>
   Ignored in the transatlantic tempest is the fact that it was
neither British nor Americans who swiped Hitler's famous ``Enigma''
encoding machine, but Poles.
</P>
<P>
   More than half a century after the end of World War II, the
crucial involvement of Polish intelligence in breaking the Enigma
code is still largely unknown to the public.
</P>
<P>
   Possession of the device, which the Germans thought was
producing an unbreakable code for military communications, has been
cited as a critical Allied advantage in World War II.
</P>
<P>
   ``Enigma intelligence enabled Britain to defeat German forces _
without it, it is no exaggeration to say that Germany might have
won the Second World War,'' wrote Cmdr. Patrick Beesly, a former
British Navy intelligence officer, in his 1977 book, ``Very Special
Intelligence.''
</P>
<P>
   Polish-American groups have responded philosophically to
Hollywood's treatment of the history of Enigma.
</P>
<P>
   ``U-571 claims credit for the Americans for Enigma work done by
Poles and Brits,'' one Polish-American wrote on an Internet
discussion site. ``Some may see no problem in this; after all, it's
a Hollywood movie, fiction and all that. Some others of us may be a
bit annoyed at this rewrite of history.''
</P>
<P>
   But the British press has been less laid-back.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whupped by the Yanks Again,'' declared The Times of London in
a May 13 article bemoaning the decision of Universal Pictures to
ignore in ``U-571'' that a crew of sailors from a British destroyer
captured an Enigma from a German submarine in 1941 _ six months
before the United States even entered the war. Other British papers
were similarly indignant.
</P>
<P>
   ``Saving Private Ryan was bad enough,'' The Times declared.
``Ignoring your partners is one thing: pretending you pulled off
one of their more spectacular coups looks like outright theft.''
</P>
<P>
   In the area of ignoring your partners, the British might
remember the Polish Military Cypher Bureau, which turned over the
Enigma machine to British intelligence shortly before Adolf
Hitler's army attacked Poland in 1939.
</P>
<P>
   The story of how Polish mathematicians not only figured out how
the Enigma machine worked, but built several working models, is
often relegated to footnote treatment in World War II histories.
</P>
<P>
   An exception was ``Ultra Goes to War,'' published in 1978 by
McGraw Hill. The book is primarily an account of ``the Ultra
Secret,'' a guarded British program of using Enigma to monitor and
decode German military radio traffic. However, author Ronald Lewin
credits Polish cryptanalysts with learning how the German Enigma
code was generated and how to break it.
</P>
<P>
   In 1926, Lewin wrote, Polish military commanders realized that
the military buildup then under way in Germany was accompanied by
the appearance of a new and evidently unbreakable code.
</P>
<P>
   Alarmed, the Polish cryptanalysts set out to learn how the code
was generated and how to break it. Three of the most brilliant
young mathematics students from a Polish university with knowledge
of German were selected for special training in cryptology.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Operation Wicher (Gale),'' with pieces of information
provided by spies in Germany and endless calculations by the young
mathematicians, the Poles figured out how Enigma worked.
</P>
<P>
   Poles used plans of the Enigma machine sold to the French
intelligence service by a German General Staff clerk. French,
British and American cryptologists decided, however, that the plans
were not enough to break the code.
</P>
<P>
   The Poles disagreed. Using the German plans, they built the
first working Enigma device. The only problem was, they did not
know how to use it to read German messages.
</P>
<P>
   Basically, the device consisted of a succession of turning
wheels somewhat like the dials of an automobile odometer. With
these wheels and a profusion of electric circuitry, Enigma would
change a ``typed'' letter to the encoded substitute.
</P>
<P>
   The ingenious _ and at that point unprecedented _ element was
the machine's capability to change the code after each letter. For
instance, a typed ``K'' might appear as an ``X'' the first time it
was used in a message, then as a ``B'' the next time. Only someone
with another Enigma machine could decode the message.
</P>
<P>
   However, the settings used to let two machines communicate with
each other were a mystery in itself. Marian Rejewski, a Polish
mathematician in his early 20s, finally determined how to decode
these settings. Rejewski spent several months breaking the code.
</P>
<P>
   Lewin wrote that when it became clear that Polish spies and
cryptanalysts had successfully solved the Enigma mystery, the
Polish General Staff secretly adopted a policy: ``In the case of a
threat of war, the Enigma secret must be used as our Polish
contribution to the common cause of defense and divulged to our
future allies.''
</P>
<P>
   Two months before the German invasion of Poland, the Polish
intelligence service secretly met with French and British officials
in France and turned over to their Western allies two working
copies of Enigma with instructions on how to decode Enigma
settings. One went to Paris, the other to London.
</P>
<P>
   ``To quantify the value of Enigma's arrival in London is beyond
mathematics,'' Lewin wrote. ``If the Polish General Staff had
decided to keep their secrets to themselves, things might have gone
differently.''
</P>
<P>
   A month after the invasion of Poland, 15 Polish code breakers
and two more Enigmas were secretly slipped into France by way of
the Orient Express, and from there to England.
</P>
<P>
   However, shortly before the British acquired the Polish-made
Enigmas, German cryptologists had added two more wheels to the
machine, greatly complicating the code and making it impossible to
use the three-wheel Polish models to decode messages. Moreover,
wheels could be moved around and wires attached in different ways,
enormously increasing the coding possibilities.
</P>
<P>
   It became an urgent goal of ``Ultra'' to locate a five-wheel
device.
</P>
<P>
   The goal was achieved in May 1941, when the German submarine
U-110 attacked a north Atlantic convoy near Greenland. U-110 was
depth-charged by the British destroyer Bulldog and forced to
surface.
</P>
<P>
   Although the German commander set charges to destroy the
submarine after ordering his crew to abandon it, the charges failed
to go off. British sailors immediately boarded the U-boat and
recovered a five-wheel Enigma and enough precious code papers to
fill several shelves.
</P>
<P>
   For three hours, a whaler shuttled back and forth through the
rough North Atlantic waters, ferrying the Enigma and documents to
the Bulldog.
</P>
<P>
   That was the heroic action that became the basis for Universal
Studio's rewrite of history in U-571.
</P>
<P>
   But without the decision of Polish officers, on the very eve of
the destruction of their own country, to share the Enigma as ``our
Polish contribution'' to the war that loomed ahead, there never
would have been even an attempt to capture the machine.

 &HT;    BRITISH UNHAPPY OVER US THEFT OF 'THEIR' WAR STORY; WHAT OF
POLES?
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (i) international categories for

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ London newspapers are up in arms over the movie
``U-571'' because it changes history and has U.S. commandos
capturing a German submarine and a priceless encoding machine, when
in fact the feat was performed by British sailors.
</P>
<P>
   Ignored in the transatlantic tempest is the fact that it was
neither British nor Americans who swiped Hitler's famous ``Enigma''
encoding machine, but Poles.
</P>
<P>
   More than half a century after the end of World War II, the
crucial involvement of Polish intelligence in breaking the Enigma
code is still largely unknown to the public.
</P>
<P>
   Possession of the device, which the Germans thought was
producing an unbreakable code for military communications, has been
cited as a critical Allied advantage in World War II.
</P>
<P>
   ``Enigma intelligence enabled Britain to defeat German forces _
without it, it is no exaggeration to say that Germany might have
won the Second World War,'' wrote Cmdr. Patrick Beesly, a former
British Navy intelligence officer, in his 1977 book, ``Very Special
Intelligence.''
</P>
<P>
   Polish-American groups have responded philosophically to
Hollywood's treatment of the history of Enigma.
</P>
<P>
   ``U-571 claims credit for the Americans for Enigma work done by
Poles and Brits,'' one Polish-American wrote on an Internet
discussion site. ``Some may see no problem in this; after all, it's
a Hollywood movie, fiction and all that. Some others of us may be a
bit annoyed at this rewrite of history.''
</P>
<P>
   But the British press has been less laid-back.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whupped by the Yanks Again,'' declared The Times of London in
a May 13 article bemoaning the decision of Universal Pictures to
ignore in ``U-571'' that a crew of sailors from a British destroyer

EARTHBOUND KITE IS A SOARING LEGACY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MARY ROGERS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Manny Estrada made his way happily through
the tables in the ballroom at the Best Western Inn. It was prom
night, so Manny wore a tuxedo and a proud smile. He carried an
impressive bouquet of red roses wrapped in green paper.
</P>
<P>
   Almost shyly, he stopped here and there to hand a long-stemmed
blossom to each of ``his girls.'' Manny is the only man in the
Masonic Home and School's Class of 2000. There are six young women
graduates, and Manny had a rose for each of them, but the flowers
were not the only remembrance he would present that Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   At that early hour, Manny still possessed the treasure: a box
kite with no string attached. He had safeguarded it for months, but
before the banquet ended and the dancing began he would pass it on,
just as others before him had done for 25 springs.
</P>
<P>
   This small kite has become a touchstone for the young men of the
Masonic Home and School, a century-old facility on Fort Worth's
south side that offers shelter and a sense of family to more than
100 youngsters from ages 4 to 19.
</P>
<P>
   Each year, during the annual Junior Senior Banquet, the kite is
handed from a senior man to a junior man. It is a reminder that
each is expected to climb high, to fly with no strings attached,
never tethered to the hurts of yesterday. ...... &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The wooden dowels are painted red now, and the brittle paper
once singed by a dormitory fire has been replaced by sheer cloth.
Each junior man who receives the kite keeps it through the year.
Then, just before graduation, he attaches his senior card to the
thin fabric and gives it away to a friend or a brother.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the young men who attended this year's banquet and prom
didn't know that the kite was flown only once, and then but
briefly, but Dan Cloud knows very well.
</P>
<P>
   In 1975, Dan was a senior at the Masonic Home and School. It
was, he remembered, a time when ``50 cents was the whole world.''
He built the kite because he didn't have one _ and because he likes
to build things.
</P>
<P>
   Dan, now of Granbury, used dowels ``liberated from the wood shop
and butcher paper from the school cafeteria;'' when he was
finished, the kite looked perfect but was too heavy to fly.
</P>
<P>
   Try as he might, Dan could not make the kite lift into the air.
It remained earthbound, its destiny never fulfilled _ until one
stormy afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   A malignant wind boiled across the sky. Weather-watchers
predicted tornadoes. The heavens turned an ominous green.
</P>
<P>
   The kite was the perfect match for the swirling gusts of wind.
Dan held the string and the little box kite raced erratically into
the stormy sky, dipping and twisting, riding briefly on the gale
like an eagle riding the updrafts.
</P>
<P>
   ``It didn't last long, but it did fly a short distance,'' Dan
recalled. He laughed, a small rumble of delight rising through
layers of memory.
</P>
<P>
   That year, at the Junior/Senior Banquet, Dan presented the kite
to his brother and the next year his brother passed it to another,
and so it has been each year since.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wonder how many of those boys have tried to fly it,'' Dan
mused. After years of civil engineering courses, time in the
construction industry, a job producing filter elements for
industrial use; after marriage and children; disappointments and
successes, Dan knows why the kite wouldn't fly.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was too much wing for the mast,'' he explained. He
needed more paper to lift the heavy burden of wood. Dan knows that
now, but then he knew only that the kite seemed married to the
soil.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I built it today, it would fly,'' he said, echoing an
oft-repeated lesson of life.

ON A SHOE QUEST FROM CLICKS TO MORTAR 
</HEADLINE>
   By MICHELLE SLATALLA   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ I am not going to waste anyone's time here with a
long theoretical discussion about the relationship of new shoes to
self-esteem. I think we can agree that the right pair will really
improve your life, at least for a day or two. That is why I got so
excited a few weeks ago in Bloomingdale's, where I saw these really
adorable Tommy Hilfiger blue plaid sneakers.
</P>
<P>
   I believe that the industry term for this style of shoe, which
resembles a bedroom slipper because it has no back, is ``mule.''
(Am I kidding? I know very well the technical term for this and
every other style of shoe ever invented, and I would be happy, if
called upon, to talk extemporaneously for a couple of hours about
the subtle differences among mules and slides and thongs.)
</P>
<P>
   Picture these plaid sneakers with denim capri pants. I did, as I
caressed one _ I mean, tested the quality of its stitching. Then I
tried to flag down one of the 50 million salesclerks stampeding
through the shoe department as though they were all late for a
Bruce Springsteen concert in another state.
</P>
<P>
   Years of shopping for shoes in Bloomingdale's have trained me to
persevere. Sure enough, after about 10 minutes, a clerk reluctantly
met my gaze. No matter what he may say later under oath, I did not,
to the best of my recollection, tap him forcefully on the shoulder
with the display sneaker to get his attention. I admit, however,
that I may have used an ``urgent'' tone to persuade him to help me.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, it didn't matter: my size was sold out. In the past
I would have accepted that bleak verdict, and after a period of
mourning I would have tried to forget the feelings I had for the
sneakers.
</P>
<P>
   But I knew that somewhere in the world was a pair of those blue
plaid sneakers in my size. A complicating factor was that I have
long counted myself among the majority of Internet shoppers who say
they are reluctant to buy clothing online because they cannot see
or touch or try it on first. But in the tug-of-war between the
sneakers and my long-held shopping convictions, the sneakers won.
</P>
<P>
   So I went right to Nordstrom.com, which claims that its
collection of 20 million pairs is the ``largest selection of shoes
on earth.'' (That may well be true, but if there isn't one pair
among the 20 million that is the right one for you, who cares?)
</P>
<P>
   A search for ``Tommy Hilfiger'' yielded a red sneaker-mule
hybrid that looked familiar. I clicked on it, and learned that it
came in many colors, including ``multi.'' A quick call to the
toll-free customer service line at Nordstrom.com confirmed that
multi meant blue plaid. So I ordered the shoes, which cost an
amount that my husband, if he is reading this, need not bother to
look up online.
</P>
<P>
   Would they fit? With the sweet rush of a highly successful
shopping experience coursing through my veins, I decided that it
didn't matter.
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly, I visit online retailers that I know, retailers
with real stores where I can return unwanted items. I ordered six
T-shirts (on sale) from Gap.com and a pair of denim capri pants
from Jcrew.com.
</P>
<P>
   Within days, packages started arriving. The plaid sneakers fit
(we are inseparable). Ditto the capri pants. The T-shirts I
returned to a Gap store three minutes away.
</P>
<P>
   The convenience reminded me of something I hadn't thought of
since childhood: Ruby's Department Store. In the Midwestern town
where I grew up, a van from Ruby's would pull into the driveway
every autumn. Inside was a selection of potential ``school
clothes'' for me and my three brothers. My mother, who was too
smart to take four small children into a real store, kept whatever
fit and sent back the rest.
</P>
<P>
   That level of personal service did not seem unusual back in the
1960s, a decade when dry cleaners and butchers and fruit sellers
stopped weekly at the homes in our middle-class neighborhood. But
in the inflationary years that followed, such deliveries became a
luxury. Most vendors gravitated in one of two different directions,
either providing a high level of customer service or low prices.
</P>
<P>
   But now the Internet makes it possible to get both. For one
thing, you can quickly compare prices online. ``But at the same
time it is a customized medium,'' said Joseph B. Pine, co-author of
``The Experience Economy'' (Harvard Business School Press, 1999).
``Anything you can digitize, you can customize how a product is
presented. You can even customize the product itself.''
</P>
<P>
   I'm not naive enough to think that I will shop for all my
clothes online in the future. Kathryn Olson, executive vice
president of marketing at Nordstrom.com, predicted that it would
depend on my mood. Some Nordstrom customers, she said, browse first
in a store, then go home and order several sizes of an item online.
They try the clothes on at home at their leisure, then return
unwanted apparel to the store.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes you may shop online for convenience,'' Olson said.
``Other times you may want the in-store environment.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, I got both. I considered a pair of pale green silk
shantung ballet flats at Talbots.com. My size was sold out, but the
Web site offered 10 percent off another style. Instead, I used the
online chat function to pester the site _ I mean, ask nicely _ to
find out if I could have the discount if I ordered the ballet flats
in a slightly larger size. Yes, a customer service representative
wrote back.
</P>
<P>
   Knowing that it would break my heart if they did not fit, I
jumped up and drove five minutes to a nearby Talbots store, tried
on the flats (the only color in the store was a less attractive
beige) and found that the larger ones in fact fit better. So I
drove home and ordered them online.
</P>
<P>
   The flats are back-ordered and will not be shipped before June
9, luckily. By then I may be ready to betray the sneakers.

graduates, and Manny had a rose for each of them, but the flowers
were not the only remembrance he would present that Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   At that early hour, Manny still possessed the treasure: a box
kite with no string attached. He had safeguarded it for months, but
before the banquet ended and the dancing began he would pass it on,
just as others before him had done for 25 springs.
</P>
<P>
   This small kite has become a touchstone for the young men of the
Masonic Home and School, a century-old facility on Fort Worth's
south side that offers shelter and a sense of family to more than
100 youngsters from ages 4 to 19.
</P>
<P>
   Each year, during the annual Junior Senior Banquet, the kite is
handed from a senior man to a junior man. It is a reminder that
each is expected to climb high, to fly with no strings attached,
never tethered to the hurts of yesterday. ...... &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The wooden dowels are painted red now, and the brittle paper
once singed by a dormitory fire has been replaced by sheer cloth.
Each junior man who receives the kite keeps it through the year.
Then, just before graduation, he attaches his senior card to the
thin fabric and gives it away to a friend or a brother.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the young men who attended this year's banquet and prom
didn't know that the kite was flown only once, and then but
briefly, but Dan Cloud knows very well.
</P>
<P>
   In 1975, Dan was a senior at the Masonic Home and School. It
was, he remembered, a time when ``50 cents was the whole world.''
He built the kite because he didn't have one _ and because he likes
to build things.
</P>
<P>
   Dan, now of Granbury, used dowels ``liberated from the wood shop
and butcher paper from the school cafeteria;'' when he was
finished, the kite looked perfect but was too heavy to fly.
</P>
<P>
   Try as he might, Dan could not make the kite lift into the air.
It remained earthbound, its destiny never fulfilled _ until one
stormy afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   A malignant wind boiled across the sky. Weather-watchers
predicted tornadoes. The heavens turned an ominous green.
</P>
<P>
   The kite was the perfect match for the swirling gusts of wind.
Dan held the string and the little box kite raced erratically into
the stormy sky, dipping and twisting, riding briefly on the gale
like an eagle riding the updrafts.
</P>
<P>
   ``It didn't last long, but it did fly a short distance,'' Dan
recalled. He laughed, a small rumble of delight rising through
layers of memory.
</P>
<P>
   That year, at the Junior/Senior Banquet, Dan presented the kite
to his brother and the next year his brother passed it to another,
and so it has been each year since.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wonder how many of those boys have tried to fly it,'' Dan
mused. After years of civil engineering courses, time in the
construction industry, a job producing filter elements for
industrial use; after marriage and children; disappointments and
successes, Dan knows why the kite wouldn't fly.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was too much wing for the mast,'' he explained. He
needed more paper to lift the heavy burden of wood. Dan knows that
now, but then he knew only that the kite seemed married to the
soil.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I built it today, it would fly,'' he said, echoing an
oft-repeated lesson of life.

   Embrace of the Lespedeza
</P>
<P>
   Q. Two years ago, I planted two small bush clovers (Lespedeza
thunbergii). Last summer, they grew well over six feet tall and
produced gorgeous purple blossoms in August and September, drowning
a rose bush next to them. This spring, all those branches are dead
and new growth is coming up from the base. Will it be just as huge
this summer? If so, should I move the rose bush or can I trim back
the lespedeza?
</P>
<P>
   A. With any luck, your plants will indeed be just as large this
year. Or maybe a bit larger. Other than that, expect the same
performance. Whether it's too big a show for the rose depends on
the rose and on your appetite for crawling around at the base of
the lespedeza.
</P>
<P>
   If the rose bush is small or prone to fungus, it should be
moved. If it's medium to large, and robust, it probably won't
suffer long-term harm from a late lespedeza embrace, especially if
those loving arms are fewer than nature intended.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, the lespedezas should be thinned rather than
trimmed. Remove up to a third of the shoots from each clump,
cutting them off right at the base. If the cut shoots keep growing,
cut them again. The less-dense lespedezas will still be tall and
weep gracefully over their neighbor, but they'll be too light and
lacy for any serious smothering.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of which, the words bush clover can terrify anyone
familiar with your plants' evil cousin, the highly invasive Chinese
lespedeza (L. cuneata). L. thunbergii isn't worry-free, but it's
usually less threatening to the surrounding countryside. It's also
inclined to be more tender than generally advertised, though
individual plants have survived as far north as Maine.
</P>
<P>
   L. thunbergii is available from Plant Delights Nursery, 9241
Sauls Road, Raleigh, N.C. 27603; (919) 772-4794. Catalog: 10
postage stamps or a box of chocolates. It's also available from
Avant Gardens, 710 High Hill Road, North Dartmouth, Mass. 02747;
(508) 998-8819. Catalog: $3, refundable with order.
</P>
<P>
   Mulch, Rain and Rot
</P>
<P>
   Q. Our vegetable garden in the upper Hudson Valley suffered
badly in last summer's drought, so this year we mulched the lettuce
and peas with straw as soon as they came up. We also put a thick
layer of it around the peppers and tomatoes. But now we're afraid
all the recent rain will lead to problems with rot. Should we take
the mulch off again and allow the garden to dry out a bit?
</P>
<P>
   A. Think about straw mulch the way you're supposed to think of
stock funds: Apply the money wisely, then leave it alone.
</P>
<P>
   Cool-weather crops like lettuce and peas should be mulched
early. The insulating layer of straw will keep the soil around
their roots nicely chilly. Hot-weather crops like tomatoes and
peppers, on the other hand, don't like cold feet. They should not
be mulched (or ideally, even planted) until the soil is thoroughly
warmed. If you have to set them in cool soil, mulch with a thin,
dark, porous weed barrier, ideally a biodegradable one.
</P>
<P>
   Arrange straw around tomatoes, peppers, eggplants and okra after
the soil is well warmed but before it's hot. If you used a barrier
at planting time, just pile the mulch on top.
</P>
<P>
   Once the mulch is in place, close to but not touching the
plants, don't mess with it unless you see rotting stems, moldy
leaves or an invasion of slugs. You put it on to help hold that
spring rain in the ground. If you move it to let the garden dry
out, that's just what the garden will do, and when the rainless
weeks of summer come, you will be sorry you didn't stay the course.
</P>

AGRI-TOURISM TAKES ROOT IN VERMONT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ELLEN BARRY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WILMINGTON, Vt. - Bill Adams was 4 when he took the job of
shifting gears on a tractor. He was a teenager when he took control
of the family farm and 45 when he despaired of it, selling off his
herd of milk cows and ultimately hoisting his powerful farmer's
body into the cab of an 18-wheeler.
</P>
<P>
   And he was 55 before he was reborn as talent.
</P>
<P>
   But here he was, in a John Deere cap and overalls, regaling
visitors from a Baltimore senior center with stories about killing
frosts and hired hands. Astride a tractor, hauling a dozen tourists
in sun visors and crepe-soled shoes, he extinguished his cigarette
on a rotating tire with two enormous
</P>
<P>
   dirt-caked fingers.
</P>
<P>
   He has been photographed chewing on a piece of hay. His daughter
Jill, who pays him by the hour to accompany tourists around the
farm, said her father has adjusted well to his new role as an
entertainer.
</P>
<P>
   ``After a couple of years doing sleigh rides, I think my dad's
accent thickened a little,'' said Jill Adams, who greets tour buses
in a checked apron with a baby on her hip, introducing herself as
the farmer's daughter. ``His accent thickened, and his body
language became a little bit more pronounced, and then he became
this Vermont character.''
</P>
<P>
   Six generations after purchasing this land, the Adams family has
become a pioneer of ``agritourism,'' or, as it is known in some
states, ``agri-tainment.''
</P>
<P>
   In Vermont, whose constellation of small dairy farms has
struggled to survive &UR;  &LR; in an age of more efficient corporate
operations, some are looking to
</P>
<P>
   agritourism as one of the last hopes for preserving the state's
quintessential &UR;  &LR; landscape.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, legislation written by Representative Bernard
Sanders, the &UR;  &LR; Vermont Independent, doubled the nation's agritourism
program to $2 million, &UR;  &LR; with assurances that at least $500,000 of
that will go to Vermont.
</P>
<P>
   And a growing number of venturesome farmers are swapping ideas
from their &UR;  &LR; agritourism wish list - a Napa Valley-style Cheese
Trail, corporate &UR;  &LR; agricultural retreats, statewide distribution of
decorative outhouses, &UR;  &LR; cornfields shaved into eye-catching
patterns, and the mobilization on the &UR;  &LR; front porches of hobby farms
of genuine, out-of-work, cranky Vermont farmers.
</P>
<P>
   It's all right with Bill Adams, who sees public relations as
just another &UR;  &LR; of the sidelines required to make ends meet on this
rocky land, like his &UR;  &LR; father's sawmill and his great-grandfather's
sap-gathering tub.
</P>
<P>
   ``The simple old life is gone. It don't fit in today's world,''
he said. ``Our &UR;  &LR; crop is fleecing the city folks.''
</P>
<P>
   It was about 80 years ago that expanding rail links and an
Eastern longing &UR;  &LR; for frontier experiences came together to form a
new kind of recreation: the &UR;  &LR; dude ranch. Agritourism's proponents
say 21st-century consumer culture has &UR;  &LR; planted the seed of a new,
but equally potent, longing - the desire to stay on &UR;  &LR; or visit a
farm and learn where food comes from, to handle the earth, and
to &UR;  &LR; touch live animals.
</P>
<P>
   The University of Southern Maine's Mark Lapping, who has
researched &UR;  &LR; agri-tourism as a route to rural development, sees a
potential for deep &UR;  &LR; relaxation as urbanites ``adapt to a different
calendar and a different &UR;  &LR; expression of time.'' They rise at 4 or 5
a.m. and fall into bed at 8 p.m., and &UR;  &LR; the time in between is
marked not by the clock but by chores.
</P>
<P>
   When Adams Farm first opened its doors to day-trippers eight
years ago - &UR;  &LR; last year the number rose to 35,000 - it took Jill
Adams a few seasons to &UR;  &LR; realize that for city dwellers, the daily
rhythms she grew up with carried the &UR;  &LR; allure of the exotic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just thought people would want to come see the baby
animals,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; ``I had no idea they would find our life and our family
fascinating. It's just &UR;  &LR; been a process of listening - of people
coming up to you and touching you and &UR;  &LR; looking at you with a deep
longing in their eyes and saying, `I wish I could &UR;  &LR; do this.' &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; ``But even with federal funds disbursed for physical
improvements like &UR;  &LR; bathroom facilities and milking-parlor viewing
stands, the fledgling hybrid of &UR;  &LR; farming and tourism has met with
skepticism.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, New England farmers are typically stretched to
their limits &UR;  &LR; with physical labor, and ``the last thing you want to
do is be nice all the &UR;  &LR; time,'' said Bob Townsend, who has pushed
agri-tourism for the past seven years with the University of
Vermont extension service.
</P>
<P>
   Others wonder whether the most vigorous, well-meaning urbanites
could integrate themselves into the life of a real farm - and if
they could, whether it would feel like entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not terribly sure,'' Lapping said, ``that there is enough
happening on a farm to keep contemporary Americans really happy for
oodles and oodles of time.''
</P>
<P>
   But at Adams Farm, as at agri-tourism ventures across the state,
there's an urgent, almost desperate message behind the down-home
showmanship. Vermont is home to 1,700 of New England's remaining
3,000 dairy farms, and many of those businesses are driving
themselves into debt, fighting for survival. Vermont's
</P>
<P>
   Washington delegation has battled to save the Northeast Dairy
Compact, which sets minimum prices for milk in an effort to keep
farms afloat financially.
</P>
<P>
   On an individual level, Vermont dairy farmers feel a passionate
need to communicate to city dwellers that they should take an
interest in where food comes from and who spends their lifetimes
producing it. As the Baltimore tourists gazed up at him from the
wagon on a recent afternoon, Bill Adams told the story of the year
he gave up his herd in a government buyout.
</P>
<P>
   ``It finally dawned on me, there's got to be a better way to
make money than to lose $100 a day,'' he said. ``Now I do what
comes naturally to me: Nothing. I'm not part of the milk surplus
problem today.''
</P>
<P>
   The tourists laughed.
</P>
<P>
   When his daughter watches him riff about the years he has spent
trying to make a living, she sees a man whose heart has been broken
by the price of milk.
</P>
<P>
   ``Growing up, milk was liquid gold to him. Now he's trucking
this fancy produce - that's what he calls it - the strawberries
that are six to a container. These are precious, precious things
right now,'' she said. ``He'll say, `Over there in the corner, all
the milk is stacked in a heap. You don't even waste your time
counting it. It's not worth anything.'''
</P>
<P>
   While farmers wait for a national initiative to save the family
farm, Sanders said, Vermont should take another route,
acknowledging the contribution that farmers already make to
tourism, the state's second-biggest industry. When National
Geographic listed 50 must-see spots recently, Vermont was the only
entire state designated - largely, Sanders said, because of the
picturesque working landscape.
</P>
<P>
   The challenge for agri-tourism is accommodating and attracting a
large number of tourists without destroying the authentic quality
they so admire. Restrooms are a major problem, for example, as are
parking lots. And many tourist attractions, like the salaried
appearance of old-time farmers, require the artificial ratcheting
up of quaintness.
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell Rasor, a Falmouth writer at work on a book about
landscapes called ``Twisted Pastoralism,'' compared the agritourism
idea to Maine's ``beauty strips'' - 100-foot stands of trees that
keep daytripping canoers from seeing
</P>
<P>
   the clear-cut forests behind them.
</P>
<P>
   But then tourism, Mark Lapping observed, has never been about
gritty truth-telling.
</P>
<P>
   ``My dad, who is the certainly the smartest man I've ever met,
will put on a very thick Vermont accent because you're going to pay
a dollar more a gallon for maple syrup,'' said Lapping, who grew up
on a dairy farm in Jericho. ``It's like so much in life. It's
marketing.''

`MONDAY NIGHT' TALENT SEARCH IS STALLED BY A LACK OF STAR
ANALYSTS 
</HEADLINE>
   By RICHARD SANDOMIR   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the 10 weeks since Boomer Esiason was fired from ``Monday
Night Football,'' ABC has offered no information about
replacement(s).
</P>
<P>
   Don Ohlmeyer, the producer, has cheerfully refused to stoke
speculation. When last seen, Howard Katz, the president of ABC
Sports, was waving the starter's flag at the Indianapolis 500 on
Sunday, leading to speculation that he was interviewing Bobby
Knight for Esiason's job.
</P>
<P>
   Current rumors have Rush Limbaugh out, Sterling Sharpe of ESPN
in and Dan Fouts, an ABC college football analyst, being
considered. Ohlmeyer said: ``We've talked to a lot of people and
auditioned a good number of people.'' Is the Star Search over?
``Maybe not,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Who besides the play-by-play announcer Al Michaels is in? Well,
Hank Williams Jr., who sings ``Monday Night's'' theme song.
</P>
<P>
   ``Probably,'' Ohlmeyer said.
</P>
<P>
   ABC's post-Esiason search has been vexed by the absence of
available superstar analysts, and the inability to find escape
clauses in the contracts of big names like Fox's Terry Bradshaw,
Howie Long and Cris Collinsworth, whom Fox made action figures of
last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``They contacted my representatives, but I'm under contract,''
Long said. He said he would have difficulty leaving Fox ``even if
there were an out in my contract'' because of loyalty to the sports
division's top executives, David Hill and Ed Goren. ``I know where
the rudder is in my shop,'' he said. ```Monday Night' is a
tremendous stage, but I don't know where it's going.''
</P>
<P>
   Ohlmeyer is on target for a mid-June announcement of his
analyst(s). ``I'm doing hard-core planning,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a ton of different pieces to pull together.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``We're focused on details like the logo, where to
shoot our openings and the number of cameras.''
</P>
<P>
   LORD STANLEY'S FINALS ON ABC
</P>
<P>
   In Year 1 of its National Hockey League contract, ABC has a
chance to carry up to five games in prime time, starting with Game
3 Saturday. During its five-year tenure with the NHL, Fox reached
its maximum of three once, last year.
</P>
<P>
   But the Devils-Dallas series offers a problem for ABC: a
possible fifth game on June 8, a Thursday, would pre-empt ``Who
Wants to Be a Millionaire.''
</P>
<P>
   On Thursdays during the recently concluded prime-time season,
``Millionaire'' averaged a 17.5 Nielsen rating, while the finals
never achieved more than a 4.0 rating on Fox. Last season, Fox
averaged a 3.4 for the finals.
</P>
<P>
   ABC's lowest-rated show this season, ``Wasteland,'' averaged a
3.8.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Hyams, ABC's vice president of audience analysis, smoothed
over the coming precipitous fall of its June 8 rating.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though ABC's prime-time number would be lower with
hockey, we are exposing the Stanley Cup finals to a much larger and
broad-based audience than those who would watch it on Saturday or
Sunday afternoons,'' Hyams said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, that benefit accrues more to the ratings-starved NHL than
to ABC. ``If hockey does well, it helps ABC,'' Hyams added.
</P>
<P>
   ABC's postseason 1.5 rating is the same Fox had through the same
stage of the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   EXTENSION PERIOD TO EXPIRE
</P>
<P>
   The exclusive period for NBC and Fox to extend their deals with
Major League Baseball expires on June 5. But baseball is unlikely
to get the maximum until it opens bidding to all comers when the
period ends.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball clearly wants a major jump above the combined $950
million Fox and NBC will have paid since 1996 when their contracts
expire after the World Series.
</P>
<P>
   ESPN's new six-year deal _ three very expensive years added to
the last three years of the previous contract _ pays baseball an
average of $135.8 million annually, nearly four times more than the
1999 fee.
</P>
<P>
   ``Show me a negotiation where anybody pays less, and we'll have
a headline,'' said Ed Goren, the president of Fox Sports. In his
view, ESPN is paying so much because its previous deal was
undervalued.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see the NBC and Fox packages as being undervalued,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   KNIGHT GETS OFF EASY
</P>
<P>
   ESPN's hourlong interview with Bob Knight on Tuesday night was
riveting as the embattled Indiana basketball coach challenged
nearly every question about his anger put to him by Roy Firestone
and Digger Phelps. But by not showing Knight the tape of him
choking a former player, Neil Reed, during a practice in 1997, ESPN
failed viewers.
</P>
<P>
   ESPN said it planned to show Knight the tape, but five minutes
before air time an Indiana official called to say that the
university believed the tape would not be aired. ``That wasn't our
understanding,'' said Josh Krulewitz, the spokesman. Why did ESPN
give in? It is reasoned, rather lamely, that it had used the tape
to introduce the show. Knight couldn't see it, rendering it
useless. What if ESPN had defied Indiana?
</P>
<P>
   ``He could have walked out,'' Krulewitz said.
</P>
<P>
   Not showing the tape lessened the program and Firestone's
ability to challenge Knight when he said he hadn't watched the tape
``because I didn't have to look at it to know that I didn't choke
anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   But Firestone was in a bind. He inexcusably admitted that he
hadn't seen the tape _ just freeze frames _ so he couldn't dispute
Knight's insistence that Reed's allegation was not fully upheld by
the tape.

PLAYING FIELD IS MORE LEVEL, BUT CROWDED 
</HEADLINE>
   By MATTHEW PURDY    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEDFORD, N.Y. _ Mauricio Auricio Alejos has spent his life on
grass. He played on two national championship soccer teams during
the 1980s in his native Guatemala. When his career dipped, he left
professional soccer and came to the United States, where he now
owns a landscaping business. Making his living on suburban lawns,
he's noticed something about his great love.
</P>
<P>
   ``The houses where I go, mowing the lawns, planting flowers, 10
years ago you never saw a soccer ball,'' he said. ``Now you see one
in every back yard.''
</P>
<P>
   He is delighted that the youth of America have discovered
soccer. But the question for Alejos is, where does that leave the
men from Latin America?
</P>
<P>
   Around 7:30 Sunday morning, about 40 Latino men were traipsing
across the dew-soaked grass behind the Fox Lane High School,
heading for the first of the day's five adult soccer games in the
Mount Kisco Soccer League. Like golfers who sleep in their cars to
beat the crowds at public courses, the soccer players rose early
partly to satisfy a passion, but mostly because it was the only
time the grass was theirs.
</P>
<P>
   The fight for space in the suburbs comes in many guises _
monster mansions vs. town houses, SUV's vs. minivans, big box
stores vs. malls. But the competition for fields of competition has
turned feverish with youth soccer still mushrooming and the
formation of more and more adult leagues, many made up of Latino
immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   Children, because they are children, come first. But immigrant
men, mostly Latino, have a cultural claim on the fields.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is our dream,'' Alejos said, watching his Kisco United
team defeat the Crow Hill Capitals. For some players, Alejos is
both coach and employer. ``I try to give a job to the guys and then
they play for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Alejos also trains young players and has seen the difficulty of
getting fields from two perspectives. ``We have no problem with the
kids,'' he said. ``But for the adults, it's very hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Soccer's boom is sometimes compared to the 1970s tennis craze or
the growth of ice hockey, but soccer stands out for its cultural
passion. Mount Kisco's adult league began three years ago after
town officials settled a federal lawsuit alleging discrimination
against the town's growing Latino population. Men complained that
they were not being allowed to play soccer in Leonard Park, an
expansive park in Mount Kisco.
</P>
<P>
   With 10 adult teams, officials in Mount Kisco and the Bedford
Central School District (which serves Mount Kisco and three other
towns) are trying to accommodate them while an endless list of
other sports beg for fields, from youth soccer and baseball to
lacrosse and field hockey.
</P>
<P>
   It's the same elsewhere. White Plains, with 50,000 people, has
about 400 adult players in three leagues and about 800 youth
players. ``In our leagues we have every South American country
represented,'' said Joseph Davidson, the city's commissioner of
recreation and parks. ``Soccer is their national sport and they
want to play it.''
</P>
<P>
   Gladys Buitron, the president of the White Plains Scorpion
Soccer Club, said city officials made many demands before allowing
adults field time for soccer four years ago. Finally, Buitron said,
a local Hispanic leader called officials and said, ``Let my people
play.'' More than 400 people showed up for opening day.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of the Hispanics who are coming to the county have very
few ways of socializing,'' said Robin Bikkal, chairwoman of the
county's Hispanic Advisory Board. ``The one bond they all have,
other than the language, is soccer.'' A recent board report called
for more soccer fields, and the county is considering five new
ones, but the soccer players keep on coming.
</P>
<P>
   Barry Salter, the president of the Westchester Youth Soccer
League, said he does not see youths and adults in competition.
They're all desperate for fields, he said. Look at his numbers.
About five years ago there were 4,500 young players in the county.
Now there are 9,000.
</P>
<P>
   Jorge Alvarado, who came here from Mexico just 13 years ago,
remembers how different it once was. He used to travel to Staten
Island, Long Island, even Connecticut, just to find players for a
game. Now there are too many players, not enough fields. But he'll
go where he has to.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let me tell you,'' said Alvarado, 33, lacing his cleats and
tying back his long black hair early Sunday morning, ``When you
have the love of this game, you'll go anywhere to play.''

 By SOMINI SENGUPTA    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In October 1998, Cynthia Marquez was suspected of
child abuse after her son Juan, a 10-year-old who takes six pills a
day to temper his behavioral problems, pummeled a younger brother,
leaving bruises on his arms. School officials called in a complaint
to the state hot line, and a city child welfare investigator
appeared at her Brooklyn apartment, inspecting her kitchen
cupboards and questioning her children.
</P>
<P>
   Nine days later, after the charges had been declared unfounded,
the case was closed. But the memory lingered.
</P>
<P>
   And so one recent evening, after Juan started misbehaving again
_ screaming, hurling things in the apartment, pushing his younger
siblings _ Marquez considered dialing 911, but stopped. What if,
she wondered, the police call the welfare agency on her for failing
to protect her other children?
</P>
<P>
   She called no one. Juan calmed down. But the disquieting choice
that Marquez, 26, faced that evening underscored a larger,
complicated fact of family life in Bushwick and other neighborhoods
like it across the city. There, where the Administration for
Children's Services is regarded as a potent, ubiquitous presence,
there is a real everyday fear that a momentary crisis can become
something worse. That a parental mistake can lead to an
investigation. Or that in the nightmare case, a difficult child can
be taken away.
</P>
<P>
   Every day, Marquez says, she worries about the consequences of
her troubled boy's temper tantrums and horseplay. ``Problem is, you
call 911, and BCW is coming to take your other kids away,'' she
said, referring to the agency, like most other parents here, by its
old name, short for the Bureau of Child Welfare.
</P>
<P>
   That kind of fear _ whether well founded or excessive _ is the
product of a tangled mix of circumstance and public policy. There
is, after all, a very real problem of child abuse and neglect in
this and other poor neighborhoods, where drug abuse, violence and
the everyday stresses of poverty have taken a heavy toll on family
life.
</P>
<P>
   Today, 20 out of every 1,000 children in Bushwick are in
protective custody, a rate 10 times as high as it is in the Upper
East Side of Manhattan and seven times what it is in solidly
middle-class section of Bayside, Queens, according to city figures.
And in Bushwick, there were 1,413 investigations of neglect or
abuse complaints in 1998, the most recent year for which statistics
are available, while there were only 109 on the Upper East Side.
</P>
<P>
   If the stakes are high for Bushwick parents, so, too, are they
for the city. The next flawed investigation could be the next
high-profile tragedy, and the city, which has stepped up
enforcement in recent years, has been alternately criticized for
sometimes failing to spot children in grave danger and at other
times for removing children far too rashly.
</P>
<P>
   That combustible combination of children at risk and an
oversight agency under pressure not to slip up can create an
atmosphere in which a wide range of parents _ some good, some bad,
some in between and stressed out _ alter their conduct, color their
conversations and have the frankest of strategic conversations with
their children, all because they worry about their first or next
encounter with the child protective agency.
</P>
<P>
   Parents in Bushwick talk with dread about the possibility that
missing eyeglasses or a broken arm could result in accusations of
child abuse. Some carry documents clearing them of child abuse
charges in case they find themselves being questioned by a
caseworker. They tell one another to always have a doctor's note
for school absences. They warn their children about what can happen
if they tell tall tales at school.
</P>
<P>
   Marquez keeps receipts showing that she has been to the food
pantry when her cupboards run bare. ``I have to protect myself,''
she said simply.
</P>
<P>
   Historically, anywhere from two-thirds to three-quarters of the
tens of thousands of reports of possible neglect or abuse
investigated by the city's child welfare agency every year turn out
to be unwarranted. And while parents in Bushwick say vigilance in
reporting concerns is a good thing, they feel they are living out
every parenting move under suspicion.
</P>
<P>
   Such suspicions and fear that abound in a neighborhood like
Bushwick do not make things easier for the agency's caseworkers.
</P>
<P>
   ``In poor neighborhoods, people get reported more often,'' said
Faye Moore, a former child protective worker in Brooklyn and now a
vice president for Local 371, the union that represents the city's
caseworkers. ``In neighborhoods where there are more reports, there
is mistrust of the agency. We walk in knowing we're not trusted.''
</P>
<P>
   Sitting along the Brooklyn-Queens border, Bushwick is among the
city's poorest neighborhoods. Nine out of 10 children in the school
district here live below the federal poverty line. A majority of
residents are blacks and Latinos, and growing numbers are newcomers
from Mexico and the Dominican Republic, with little or no ability
to communicate in English.
</P>
<P>
   In the neighborhood's schoolyards and bodegas, on tenement
stoops and in community meetings, parents trade tales about their
own encounters with the agency. Some are true; others are bits of
scary folklore. All, while hard to definitively confirm, stoke the
very real emotional stress of the neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   Marquez says she has heard of a mother who was reported for
neglect because her son's school uniform was not properly pressed.
</P>
<P>
   Nieves Padilla, 43, a single mother of four teen-agers in the
Hope Gardens housing project, had a social worker arrive at her
door, she says, because she refused to sign papers authorizing her
daughter to be placed in special education. The charges, brought in
1991, were ultimately dropped, according to papers that Padilla
still takes with her to school meetings.
</P>
<P>
   Nery Mejia said her daughter, then 5, suffered a gash below her
eye during a squabble over a stuffed toy several years ago. Mejia
wound up with a child abuse case against her after a school
official reported it to the state central register.
</P>
<P>
   The city cannot confirm or deny either Mejia's or Padilla's
version of events because they both occurred at a time when charges
ultimately deemed to be unwarranted were expunged from the record.
Under a new law passed after the 1995 killing of 6-year-old Elisa
Izquierdo, case files are now maintained even if charges are
dropped. Elisa was beaten to death by her mother, whom the city had
long suspected of child abuse and neglect.
</P>
<P>
   By Mejia's account, she spent months after the investigation
sleeping at her daughter's side, reassuring the child, and
apparently herself as well, that nothing would come between them.
``I was scared one day they'd come and take my daughter,'' she
recalled.
</P>
<P>
   Padilla, 43, wondered aloud whether there was a financial
incentive for calling in a complaint to the state child abuse
register. ``I don't know if the teacher gets some money!'' she
suggested, rolling her eyes to the sky.
</P>
<P>
   They do not.

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Charlotte Bunch is an earnest woman with a mission: to build a
worldwide network of feminists who will press their local
governments to end violence against women, be it genital mutilation
in Africa, bride burning in India, honor killing in the Middle East
or rape on the battlefields of Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   In certain hands, these are the topics of tabloid television.
Picture women in exotic dress, with their backs to the camera,
telling lurid tales of abuse. Picture prime-time promos, studded
with exclamation marks. Picture early Geraldo, braying outrage.
</P>
<P>
   This is not Bunch's way. She makes her case with the measured
convolutions of academia and diplomacy, verbal porridge to some but
suitable to her position as director of the Center for Women's
Global Leadership at Rutgers University and a key player in the
movement for international human rights for women.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, Bunch will lead a symposium at Columbia University on
the eve of a special session of the U.N. General Assembly, known as
Beijing Plus Five, which will review the progress made since the
1995 World Conference on Women. That conference of 181 nations
produced a ``platform for action,'' which women's groups hoped
would become an international standard.
</P>
<P>
   Bunch's 10-year-old institute trains many of these international
feminists in leadership skills and organizing techniques. What may
be new to the women of Namibia or Guatemala is old hat to Bunch,
who in the 1960s and '70s was quite the firebrand.
</P>
<P>
   It is hard to see the radical passion of youth in the
55-year-old woman who spends most of her time these days in
conference rooms overlooking U.N. Plaza. Bunch is conservatively
dressed, her hair cropped for convenience and her only accessory a
utilitarian tote bag. She calls herself an activist and remains
one, staid but fervent.
</P>
<P>
   Bunch came of age at Duke University, in the midst of the civil
rights and anti-war movement, learning community organizing as a
member of the World Student Christian Federation, one of many
faith-based organizations of that era that schooled the leaders of
the New Left.
</P>
<P>
   She took a path different from her family's, but came naturally
to her social action. Her parents, Methodist missionaries, were
studying to go to China when Pearl Harbor intervened. Instead, her
father, a family doctor, volunteered for assignment in under-served
rural areas.
</P>
<P>
   He wound up in Artesia, N.M., far from Taos or Sante Fe, in a
part of the state known as Little West Texas. ``We were liberals in
a conservative small town,'' Bunch said. ``Professionals, when
everyone else was working class.''
</P>
<P>
   Her mother was a social worker until her four children were
born, then what Bunch calls a ``civic actor,'' the first woman to
be president of the school board and later founder of the state's
first community mental health program. Her mother is now 87 and is
teaching English to immigrants and feeding the homeless.
</P>
<P>
   Bunch's two sisters are schoolteachers, and her brother a
small-town doctor. ``I'm the only one who made a career of being an
activist,'' she said. ``But all of us made a life of service in the
community.''
</P>
<P>
   After Duke, where Bunch studied history and political science
and participated in the early sit-ins, she accepted a fellowship at
the Institute for Policy Studies, a left-leaning research group in
Washington. She had expected to be a full-fledged member of an
intellectual community, as she had been in the Christian
Federation, but instead encountered male chauvinism typical of the
times.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd make a comment at a meeting, and nobody would even
acknowledge me,'' Bunch said. ``Then some man would say the same
thing, and they'd all nod and say, `Good idea.' They turned me into
a feminist because I was so frustrated. I'm grateful to them.''
</P>
<P>
   It was during her years at the institute, from 1969 to 1977,
that Bunch identified herself as a lesbian, organized a radical
women's discussion group and founded the Furies Collective, a
lesbian newspaper, and Quest: A Feminist Quarterly.
</P>
<P>
   The discovery of her sexual orientation, after living as a
member of the white, middle-class Protestant majority, clarified
``what it means to have privilege and what it means not to have
privilege,'' she said. ``It enabled me to understand, emotionally
as well as intellectually, what it feels like to be marginalized.''
</P>
<P>
   To be an American, Bunch knew, is to be privileged, so she
turned her gaze toward the international arena, becoming, in
effect, a feminist missionary. That meant nearly a decade
organizing conferences around the world. In 1987, she accepted an
invitation to bring her global perspective to Rutgers.
</P>
<P>
   The Center for Women's Global Leadership was the gleam of an
idea, intended as an adjunct to the Center for American Women in
Politics, an existing research and policy organization at Rutgers.
Bunch was determined that it not take the predictable course as an
incubator for international political leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need women leaders,'' she agreed. ``But we need them to
have a vision for something.''
</P>
<P>
   That something, Bunch decided, should be an end to violence
against women in all its permutations, from a battered executive
wife in America to a starving Eastern European woman sold into
prostitution. ``This is what women have in common,'' Bunch said,
``without pretending we are all the same.''

   Warner Books, $25.95
</P>
<P>
   What makes it OK to turn the spotlight on Jacqueline Kennedy
Onassis again?
</P>
<P>
   This spring, there are two new books on the former First Lady:
``Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy Onassis: A Life,'' by Donald Spoto,
and ``Jackie, Ethel, Joan'' by Randy Taraborrelli, about Jackie's
relationship with the wives of Robert and Ted Kennedy. Both turn
over JFK-era rocks and poke at the squirmy, icky things underneath
_ the stuff no one should want to touch, look at or hear. That
period has been filed under ``National Tragedy,'' and the staining
of memories with additional details offered by Taraborrelli and
Spoto ought to leave readers swimming in a cesspool of
self-loathing.
</P>
<P>
   Taraborrelli's book is slimy with hot, sticky gossip. Even
though the pages are sandwiched between hard covers, they read like
clippings from the cheesiest of tabloids.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jackie loved to gossip, and always had. However, when the
gossip was about her, she didn't much like it,'' Taraborrelli
writes.
</P>
<P>
   After slogging through Taraborrelli's chapters on betrayal,
assassination, infidelities, assassination, manipulation, and
tragedy, tragedy, tragedy, readers might fear a karmic comeuppance
for having touched these books.
</P>
<P>
   Even Spoto's work, which attempts a higher road, is tainted with
tell-all.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was required only to be and to appear at the proper place
and time, smiling, waving, an ambassador of what-you-will. She did
not have to accomplish anything of significance. People required
only that she look magnificent,'' Spoto writes. ``She had perhaps
no alternative but to offer the public a kind of mask and to
retreat into her deserved privacy behind that mask. She was not a
cold woman, but her image became that of someone predictable in her
elegance and almost immutable in her character.''
</P>
<P>
   He avoids the seamier moments of the Kennedy and Onassis
marriages, and expands on Jackie's third act, as an editor for
Doubleday, a period of great satisfaction for her.
</P>
<P>
   She wanted a simple life with a happy family. She was raised to
be a trophy wife by a mother who cared more for social standing and
wealth than emotional well-being. Jackie tried to please everyone,
and in doing so became the tragic queen of Camelot.
</P>
<P>
   Our longtime allegiance is with Jackie; yet, with these and
previous books about her, we've forged a retail covenant with
gossipy writers. The paradox would have trapped her, too.

FOUR SUMMER SURPRISES BY UNKNOWN AUTHORS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JEFF GUINN 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The summer blockbuster books are about to descend upon us.
Beginning in early June with ``Portrait of an Artist, as an Old
Man'' (Simon &AMP; Schuster, $23), Joseph Heller's posthumous,
near-autobiographical final novel, and finishing in late August
with ``The Bear and the Dragon'' (Putnam, $28.95), another Jack
Ryan multipager from Tom Clancy _ with J.K. Rowling's ``Harry
Potter and the Doomspell Tournament'' (July, Levine/Scholastic,
$25.95) in between _ many of modern literature's biggest names will
compete for your vacation and/or poolside reading dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, it's easy to forget that this summer's books will, as
always, include wonderful work by authors whose names aren't so
familiar. For those who'd like to alternate titles by favorite
writers with books by newcomers, here are several suggestions for
near-guaranteed summer reading pleasure:
</P>
<P>
   Above all, try ``World of Pies'' by Karen Stolz (June, Hyperion,
$18.95). A creative-writing teacher in Austin, Stolz utilizes a
striking approach to fiction in her first novel: Each chapter
chronicling the life and times of small-town Texas girl Roxanne
involves some sort of recipe, which is faithfully printed at
chapter's end. That approach could quickly become too cute and
stale, but Stolz is such a skillful writer that it seems entirely
natural that her characters would use food as a sort of emotional
lighthouse.
</P>
<P>
   ``A woman bakes a little piece of herself into a pie,''
Roxanne's mother says.
</P>
<P>
   By book's end _ when the once-semirebellious Roxanne moves back
to the quaint town of Annette so her daughter can experience the
pleasures of small-town life _ readers will want to move there,
too, and gobble some lemon meringue pie or Dutch crumb cake.
``World of Pies'' is likely to garner rapturous reviews and
gradually increasing sales.
</P>
<P>
   Whether or not ``Sorority Sisters'' (Villard, $19.95) is a
bestseller, Tajuana Butler and her novel provide perhaps the most
heartwarming story of the summer.
</P>
<P>
   Butler originally self-published ``Sorority Sisters,'' a salty
tale of several vastly different young women who become friends and
soul mates in college. Last year, after months of peddling the book
at flea markets and garage sales, Butler attended Book Expo
America, the publishing industry's annual national trade show, and
forced a copy on an associate editor from Villard. The editor
reluctantly agreed to read ``Sorority Sisters:'' one day later, she
purchased it.
</P>
<P>
   And with good reason; Butler's characters glimmer with
multidimensional charm, even while pondering seemingly
insignificant things, like whether the paraphernalia table should
be where the hors d'oeuvres table is, as they arrange a room for a
sorority mixer.
</P>
<P>
   It is rare for a self-published writer to have book rights
purchased by a major publishing house, and then go on to become a
famous, bestselling author. The best recent example? None other
than John Grisham.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Sherman Alexie was selected by ``The New Yorker''
magazine as one of the best American fiction writers under age 40.
That honor was based on Alexie's short-story collection ``The Lone
Ranger and Tonto Fistfight in Heaven.'' The Spokane/Coeur d'Alene
Indian always creates fascinating scenarios featuring American
Indians, and his latest series of stories, ``The Toughest Indian in
the World'' (Atlantic Monthly Press, $24), is no exception.
</P>
<P>
   There is, perhaps, one major difference here between Alexie's
usual protagonists and those populating ``The Toughest Indian in
the World.'' This time, he has chosen to depict American Indians
who have achieved at least middle-class success. They still have to
be wary of the white world, though. As one character in the title
story notes, ``Love you or hate you, white people will shoot you in
the heart.'' Enemies may now substitute innuendo for bullets, or
social repression for physical assault. But the result, Alexie
believes, is the same: ``We could have been a thousand vestigial
reproductions of a single organ, all of us struggling to find a
purpose, a place to stand and breathe, enough room to function
within the large body of a thing, a person, a crowd called
Indian.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, there is Jim Knipfel's ``Quitting the Nairobi Trio''
(Tarcher/Putnam, $23.95) _ the title comes from a regular sketch on
the old ``Ernie Kovacs'' TV show _ a book that ought to be
dismaying, if not downright off-putting, but isn't.
</P>
<P>
   Knipfel, now a staff writer for the ``New York Press,'' writes
candidly about his 1987 stay in a Minneapolis mental hospital after
a failed suicide attempt. Most chapters are obviously based on
actual experience. But several, which are never presented as
different from the others, describe Knipfel's hallucinatory
episodes. These, he notes in a foreword, ``are as real to me as
lunch. They may have been simple hallucinations. They may represent
what my doctors later called a `psychotic break.' Or as I believed
for some time afterward, I may have died after that overdose and
gone to Hell for a few days.''
</P>
<P>
   Every page of ``Quitting the Nairobi Trio'' will make readers
uncomfortable. The topic of mental illness, Knipfel notes almost
gleefully, makes ``most people get creepy and nervous ... I
understand that.''
</P>
<P>
   But what he has to tell us _ not only that the mentally ill are
people, too, but that they're interesting people we should study
instead of compulsively ignore _ is important. Where ``I Never
Promised You a Rose Garden'' and ``One Flew Over the Cuckoo's
Nest'' were primarily entertainment, ``Quitting the Nairobi Trio''
is more read-and-learn, with occasional amusement as a side
benefit. It's powerful and, frankly, wonderful.

&HT;     A PRESCHOOL IS SPARED, FOR NOW 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     Commentary  
 &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By ROB MORSE  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ ``Don't mess with parents,'' Kathy Jones said.
``It's like that old rule about not coming between a bear and her
cub.''
</P>
<P>
   The Carmel Companies, the new owner of the Parkmerced housing
development, walked into the middle of the parents and the 50
children of the Montessori Children's Center, and found itself
thoroughly clawed.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, Carmel gave the 24-year-old preschool 50
days' notice of eviction, with no time for parents like Jones to
get their kids into any other school in the fall. Carmel became
villain-of-the-month in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday night, Carmel's attorney, Joe Bravo, was brave enough to
venture into a meeting of outraged and tearful parents and do a
little back-pedaling. He said Carmel will not evict the school for
at least a year, and will engage in good-faith mediation with the
school.
</P>
<P>
   Bravo received some polite applause, but also some questions
about why the school ever has to leave, and what will happen to
teachers given a year's notice. Parents also wanted to know why
Carmel suddenly was willing to give the school a year's stay of
execution.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pressure, that's why,' yelled someone in the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   It was a crowd that did remarkably little yelling, considering
they were parents faced with a big corporation coming between them
and their children. It was a crowd that knew how to bring San
Francisco-style moral suasion to bear on an outside corporation.
</P>
<P>
   They raised hell. They went to newspapers with the ultimate
eviction story, the story of big-bucks developers evicting an
excellent school and its students.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Tom Lantos, D-Calif., wrote a letter offering to serve as
mediator. The Board of Supervisors issued a resolution, by
Supervisor Mabel Teng, urging Parkmerced do everything it can to
keep the school alive.
</P>
<P>
   You had to wonder how Carmel was dumb or arrogant enough to walk
into this public relations disaster. Tuesday night's meeting was
attended by two news crews and representatives of Supervisors Tom
Ammiano and Leland Yee and Assemblyman Kevin Shelley.
</P>
<P>
   You also have to wonder, as parent Kent Dauterman did, what will
happen in four or five months, or a year, if the media loses
interest.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to stop a big corporation from doing what it wants
with its property, and it may be naive to ask for some humanity in
the greedy marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   Behind the Montessori Children's Center are acres of open space
suitable for development, some of it slated to be a day care
center, but not a school, according to Carmel's lawyer. The
Montessori Children's Center occupies street-front property, and
could be in the way of something big.
</P>
<P>
   ``Remember that these children do not see themselves simply as
students at school,'' Dauterman wrote last week in his letter of
protest to the Carmel Companies. ``They are young enough that this
school is their entire world.''
</P>
<P>
   What does that little world mean? Ask Caan Nguyen, who came to
this country in 1975 from Vietnam, learned how good the Montessori
Children's Center is, and when he had children sent two of them
there.
</P>
<P>
   His oldest son, Alexander Nguyen, went on to kindergarten at
West Portal Elementary School, and has won first prize in a
district-wide essay contest for kindergartners.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know he didn't get it from me,'' Nguyen said. ``He got it
here, at this school.''
</P>
<P>
   The little school is neat as can be, with fresh paint, clean
floors and teaching materials stacked by the eight staffers who
stand to lose their jobs in a year, or whatever length of time is
mediated.
</P>
<P>
   A watercolor of the school, painted by Robert Flynn, husband of
school director Judith Flynn, hangs in the entrance next to
paintings of mothers with children by Raphael and Mary Cassatt. The
school glistens with care and pride.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the management of Parkmerced says the school has to go
because the building isn't up to some not-quite-specified ideas of
snuff. Bravo, Carmel's attorney, says the building is too old and
wasn't designed as a school.
</P>
<P>
   One of the school's founders, Rebecca Cherny, listed dozens of
schools, modest and glamorous, that are in old buildings not
designed as schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``Twenty-four years ago, my daughter opened the doors of this
school, and now she's a third-year med student at Stanford _ that's
what good early childhood education did for her,'' Cherny said.
</P>
<P>
   Phyllis Deets is a parent of another of the school's graduates
who went on to Stanford. ``My daughter wants to go into foreign
service, be a diplomat. How many kids graduating out of Stanford
want to do that?'' Deets said. ``It's because they're teaching
values here.''
</P>
<P>
   Judith Flynn, the school's director, said that last summer she
was at a meeting of an international group called Educators Without
Borders, and jokingly said the frontiers for children may not
necessarily be in places like Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``Little did I know,'' she said, ``that my frontier would be in
my back yard.''

NEW `OFF-RAMP' A FUN-FILLED RIDE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN LEVESQUE  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the star-driven world of tellytainment, the anthology series
is up there with pyorrhea on the list of items generally not wished
for when blowing out the birthday candles.
</P>
<P>
   Even a story-driven show like ``Law &AMP; Order,'' famous for its
revolving-door casting, could never have made it to a 10th season
without some semblance of year-to-year stability. Be honest. Would
you tune in every week if you knew Jerry Orbach wasn't returning as
Det. Lennie Briscoe, or if Angie Harmon was never again to make an
appearance as A.D.A. Carmichael?
</P>
<P>
   This absence of star power makes ``Hollywood Off-Ramp'' the most
likely candidate for best new series you won't remember next year.
But enjoy it while it lasts. Beginning with a Sunday night premiere
and then moving to Mondays at 10 p.m. on E! Entertainment
Television, ``Hollywood Off-Ramp'' looks to be the Chee-tos of
cable: salty, not very good for you, lots of fun.
</P>
<P>
   True, this would define most of the programming on the E!
channel. But when placed alongside ``Wild On ...,'' ``Howard
Stern'' and the latest ``Sexy Swimwear'' installment, ``Off-Ramp''
actually offers some fiber. OK, maybe it's more like the stringy
filament from a celery stalk, but we're talking E! Entertainment
Television here, not PBS.
</P>
<P>
   Hosted by Brian Unger, ``Hollywood Off-Ramp'' borrows
shamelessly _ correction: steals shamelessly _ from ``The Twilight
Zone.'' Unger, a former correspondent and fill-in anchor on ``The
Daily Show'' at Comedy Central, writes his own wry intros and exits
for each half-hour episode.
</P>
<P>
   In Sunday's premiere, which centers on a producer's frantic
efforts to woo a reclusive actor to his next film, Unger intones
with Rod Serling-like seriosity: ``A truly great actor chooses to
work once every 10 years, creates a definitive role, then retreats
_ with the cash _ back to the ashram, where he slowly bloats up
like a tick.''
</P>
<P>
   After episode three, which follows the activities of a 1940s-era
gossip columnist, Unger allows that the appetite for entertainment
dish is even more insatiable today. He adds: ``That's why these
days celebrities pay managers and publicists, who protect them by
making sure their clients' names appear with mind-numbing frequency
in every gossip column on the planet, no matter how much they have
to lie to get it there.''
</P>
<P>
   Shot in Vancouver, B.C., the stories that play out between
Unger's pithy prose are crafted stylishly with black humor and
brick-subtle satire. Each has a ``Twilight Zone'' twist at the end,
which will encourage regular viewers to tune in and guess how
things turn out. Some make sense, some blur the line between fact
and fiction. Either way, ``Hollywood Off-Ramp'' is a refreshing
throwback to an earlier age, when television was more interested in
content _ and so were the people who were watching.
</P>
<P>
   Episode Two, which airs Monday at 10 p.m. in the show's regular
time period, puts it in beautifully succinct perspective when a
famous actor, tired of starring in slasher films, tells his
director and his manager that he wants to be an artist, not a hack.
The director replies: ``You are better than an artist. You are a
pop-culture icon!''
</P>
<P>
   Hollywood Off-Ramp. Half-hour anthology series satirizing the
antics of people in show business. Series premiere Sunday at 10
p.m., E! Entertainment Television. Show moves to its regular day
and time Monday at 10 p.m. Parental guideline rating: TV-PG.

movie called ``Dummy,'' he could not help feeling a little hopeful.
There is a difficult combination of realism and optimism that life
as a New York actor demands, and Walker had perfected it, scraping
by on the odd bits of work that define daily existence for so many
people in the profession. It was on his trip home that Walker was
fatally struck by a double-decker tour bus, setting off a wave of
outrage against its operator, the problem-ridden New York Apple
Tours. The reaction in theater circles was more than anger or
sadness; New York's acting rank and file, who live the rare highs
and relentless lows of the city's performing arts, had lost one of
their own. By Robin Pogrebin.

STOP CHATTING AND DEAL, GRANDPA 
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVID KUSHNER    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Online gamers have been sensationalized as social misfits,
juvenile delinquents, even aspiring sharpshooters. They have been
the subjects of psychological studies, including one reported last
month in The Journal of Personality and Social Psychology that
linked exposure to violent video games to aggressiveness and
delinquency.
</P>
<P>
   But the portrait of the online gamer as a young incipient
sociopath is inaccurate, game industry experts say. Although fans
of ultraviolent first-person shooter games like Doom and Quake
helped establish the culture of online gaming, there now is an
entirely new ruling class. These days, Internet gamers are not some
clan of elusive teen-age demons. More likely, they are Mom and Dad.
</P>
<P>
   Across the Net, sites like Uproar, Pogo.com and Mplayer and
portals like Excite and Yahoo are scoring big with casual adult
gamers. Card and board games, most of which can be played free,
have become a sensation among middle-aged adults and retirees.
</P>
<P>
   According to Media Metrix, a company that measures Internet and
digital media use, nearly 50 percent of Web site gamers are over 30
and prefer killing time with classics like hearts, bridge,
checkers, backgammon and bingo. Nearly half of all online gamers
are women, the company says.
</P>
<P>
   Helen Frederick, 59, of Huntington Beach, Calif., says she
spends three to four hours a day playing puzzle games like Overflow
and Poppit on Pogo.com.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to watch TV,'' she said. ``But now I play these games.
I like them better than TV because they make me think.''
</P>
<P>
   Donald and Laura Bergstrom, a middle-age couple in Saddle Brook,
N.J., have given up prime-time television for online bingo. ``It's
competitive and addictive,'' Bergstrom said, ``and we don't have to
go to some smoky bingo hall.''
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Ryon, senior vice president and general manager of the
new-media group at Media Metrix, said that much of the appeal of
these games was their simplicity. ``People want games that don't
require a great learning curve,'' he said. ``People don't want to
think that much. They just want to have some fun.''
</P>
<P>
   With these kinds of games, fun does not require the latest
technology. High-end multiplayer PC games like Unreal Tournament
and Ultima Online work better with faster chips and speedy Internet
connections. But online board or card games, cobbled together as
quick and easy Java programs, do not require complicated
installations, computers equipped with the latest multimedia
technology or even the hijacking of a company's lightning-fast T-1
Internet connection. Within minutes of visiting a site like
Pogo.com or Yahoo, gamers can be tossing the dice, going
head-to-head in a game of backgammon.
</P>
<P>
   For the sites offering these games, low-end programs mean low
start-up costs. A typical high-end PC game, like those that can be
played online, costs about $4 million to produce, according to an
estimate by the Interactive Digital Software Association. By
contrast, a tiny Java-based parlor game like hearts or spades can
be made for less than $100,000.
</P>
<P>
   To lure players, casual gaming sites like iWin and Uproar offer
prizes like cruises, theater tickets or cash. Brenda Lesack, a
50-year-old artist from Brandon in Manitoba, Canada, won $2,320 by
playing Blowout Bingo on Uproar. Lesack said she typically spent
two to three hours a day playing online.
</P>
<P>
   Though the cash payout was nice, she said, it is not the only
reason she plays. ``I like to meet people around the world,'' she
said. ``It's nice to chat with people while you're playing.''

   Karen McCarthy, of Fredericksburg, Va., has formed offline
relationships with other adult gamers on Mplayer. com. ``I play for
friendship, not prizes,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The social atmosphere often seems to be the biggest draw. Casual
games not only offer free and fast competition but also inspire
small talk. Instead of going to the water cooler, people can shoot
the breeze online while they shoot the dice.
</P>
<P>
   ``These games combine all the great elements of the Web:
community and entertainment,'' said Michael Latham, senior director
of production for Yahoo's entertainment and media group. ``We see
this community as something that's as important as having e-mail or
a calendar.''
</P>
<P>
   In the gaming communities within portals like Excite and Yahoo,
players mingle throughout the day looking for quick pick-up games.
In a typical round, a gamer might be carrying on three different
games at once, chatting simultaneously with the various opponents.
</P>
<P>
   With so much online activity, it is no wonder the dot-coms have
been clamoring for the family gaming pie. Pogo.com abandoned its
hard-core gaming roots for that reason. Just a couple of years ago,
Pogo.com, which is based in San Francisco, was known as Total
Entertainment Network, one of the pioneering pay-to-play services
aimed at connecting fans of high-end games. But the company quickly
realized that serious gamers had no need to pay someone else to
facilitate their online battles.
</P>
<P>
   The model broke down, said Erick Hachenburg, Pogo.com's
president and chief executive. ``When we looked at market, it
didn't make sense,'' Hachenburg said. ``Hard-core gamers are very
much a niche market.''
</P>
<P>
   The company jettisoned Quake for checkers and several other
low-end games in 1998 and changed its name the next year to evoke a
more traditional family toy: the pogo stick. Visitors to the site
now have a choice of matching their skills at everything from
euchre to crosswords.
</P>
<P>
   The gamble has paid off. Since the makeover, Pogo.com's usage
hours have doubled every quarter, with 25,000 new members joining
every day. In January, Neilsen/Net-Ratings ranked Pogo.com as the
second-most ``sticky'' site on the Web for its ability to keep
visitors on the site for long periods.
</P>
<P>
   But not all the earliest online gaming sites have abandoned
their hard-core roots. Half of the users of Mplayer.com, based in
Mountain View, Calif., play high-end games like Quake III Arena.
Those games have loyal followings, said Chris Early, a vice
president and the general manager of Mplayer.com, so the company
has no need to do without them. To woo the more sophisticated
players, the site offers features like voice chat, which allows
players to talk to each other online via a microphone.
</P>
<P>
   Surprisingly, Early said, many of the younger, more
stereotypical gamers often cross over into the low-end arena.
``Every time we launch a new casual game,'' he said, ``we get a
rash of traditional hard-core gamers coming to try them out. It's a
little unusual for Martha from Wiscogee to play hearts with someone
with a nickname like I'm Gonna Kill You. ''
</P>
<P>
   Then again, with the way online games are going, all bets are on
Martha.

DON'T MAKE A MESS OF SOCIAL SECURITY SUCCESS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JACK Z. SMITH 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Social Security is the single most successful program in
government history. Without it, more than half of all seniors would
live in poverty.''
</P>
<P>
   _ George W. Bush, in Rancho Cucamonga, Calif., May 15. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Dear Gov. Bush:
</P>
<P>
   I certainly agree with you that Social Security has been a
splendid program.
</P>
<P>
   But I've read in the papers that you want to make a big change
in it. I hear that you want to partly ``privatize'' it.
</P>
<P>
   You were pretty doggone vague when you announced your
privatization ``plan'' for Social Security two weeks ago. But you
said enough to make me antsy about what might happen to ``the
single most successful program in government history'' if you land
in the White House.
</P>
<P>
   You said you want to let people invest part of their Social
Security payroll taxes in individual retirement accounts. They
could put the money in stocks or other investments that might earn
a higher rate of return than Social Security funds invested in
government bonds.
</P>
<P>
   Here's why your strategy bothers me:
</P>
<P>
   For every dollar a person earns up to $76,200, 6.2 cents is
deducted for Social Security payroll taxes. The employer kicks in a
matching amount, for a total of 12.4 cents.
</P>
<P>
   Under your plan, an employee could keep a portion of the payroll
tax _ perhaps 2 cents of each 12.4 cents _ and put it in an
individual retirement account.
</P>
<P>
   The trouble is, Social Security is a pay-as-you-go program.
About 90 percent of payroll taxes go to pay current Social Security
benefits. If workers divert money into individual accounts, that
will sharply reduce the amount of incoming payroll taxes devoted to
paying current benefits.
</P>
<P>
   To make up for this shortfall, you'll probably have to cut
benefits, since you're opposed to raising payroll taxes. Or you
might try to find some highly questionable source of supplemental
funding, such as those projected long-range federal budget
surpluses that may never materialize.
</P>
<P>
   Your plan also would diminish the progressive nature of the
Social Security system, which has historically given low-income
people retirement benefits that represent a higher percentage of
their lifetime wages than the benefits that high-income earners
get.
</P>
<P>
   Unselfish Americans have long viewed this progressive feature as
social insurance that provides a decent floor of retirement
benefits for the less fortunate among us.
</P>
<P>
   If you want to raise Social Security's rate of return, why not
preserve the present system but have Congress change the law to
allow a limited portion of Social Security trust funds to be put
into potentially higher-yielding investments such as stock funds?
</P>
<P>
   By the way, AARP, the leading U.S. senior citizens'
organization, likes that approach much more than your privatization
scheme. With such an approach, payroll tax revenues would be
sufficient to pay current benefits. And the investments would be
pooled nationwide, reducing administrative costs and making them
less risky than individual retirement accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Social Security should be just one leg of a personal retirement
plan. And it should be the ultrasafe, secure part, not some Las
Vegas crap shoot based on dicey investments. If you want to pour
money into highly speculative stocks, you can do it on your own or
through vehicles such as a 401(k) plan.
</P>
<P>
   Everybody should be concerned about projected future Social
Security deficits. But the system is not expected to come up short
in paying benefits for 30-plus years, even if no changes are made.
</P>
<P>
   We'll probably need to increase the payroll tax modestly over
time and gradually raise the amount of income taxed, because people
are living longer and the ratio of workers to retirees is falling.
</P>
<P>
   But, Governor, please don't jeopardize what you call ``the
single most successful program in government history.''
</P>
<P>
   Sincerely,
</P>
<P>

NORTH KOREAN LEADER REPORTED TO HAVE VISITED CHINA 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: This early version will be updated as needed.) 
 By ELISABETH ROSENTHAL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ Beijing was buzzing Wednesday with reports that North
Korea's reclusive leader, Kim Jong Il, made a secret visit to
Beijing this week to consult with China's leaders on the upcoming
summit meeting between North and South Korea.
</P>
<P>
   The story first appeared Wednesday morning in a South Korean
newspaper, which said that Kim stayed at China's state Diaoyutai
Guest House from Monday to Wednesday and was returning to Pyongyang
by train Wednesday evening.
</P>
<P>
   The report could not be independently confirmed.
</P>
<P>
   The visit would be Kim's first overseas trip since succeeding
his father, Kim Il Song, who died in July 1994, and a significant
sign that he is interested in reducing his country's diplomatic
isolation, experts here said.
</P>
<P>
   The trip was not announced in either North Korea or China, and
an official at the North Korean Embassy here denied the reports.
</P>
<P>
   But Sun Yuxi, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman, was more
cryptic, saying, ``I do not confirm or deny that.''
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese have long encouraged Kim to visit Beijing, and
Foreign Ministry officials have predicted that he would come later
this year, perhaps following an exchange of visits by other senior
officials. Kim made an unusual visit to the Chinese Embassy in
Pyongyang several months ago, in what was seen as a prelude to such
a trip.
</P>
<P>
   A number of previous invitations by Beijing were rebuffed, or,
more commonly, never answered, Chinese officials say.
</P>
<P>
   But many experts were skeptical that Kim himself was in town
this week, since China's leaders have been busy entertaining
President K.R. Narayanan of India.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   An official at the train station in Shenyang, in northeast China
near the North Korean border, said that a special train bound for
North Korea had passed there Wednesday afternoon, but he did not
know if Kim was on board, according to Reuters. But Wednesday
evening dispatchers there said they knew of no such train.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   North Korea's Kim and South Korean President Kim Dae Jung are
scheduled to meet in the North Korean capital of Pyongyang on June
12-14.
</P>
<P>
   Although China and North Korea are old political allies, and
fought side by side during the 1950-53 Korean War, China has also
cultivated ties with South Korea in recent years and is strongly
supporting the upcoming bilateral talks, eager to avoid renewed war
so close to its border.
</P>
<P>
   But also, the Chinese government is clearly becoming impatient
with North Korea's unwillingness to undertake reforms that might
help rescue its economy and end years of desperate food shortages.
</P>
<P>
   Those problems spill over into China in the form of hundreds of
thousands of North Korean migrants who cross illegally into China
in search of food and other necessities.
</P>
<P>
   Chinese officials say they have been encouraging North Korea to
follow their economic example: scrapping a command economy for
market-driven reforms. And there have been signs that Kim is
considering that possibility, for example, by tolerating the growth
of small private produce markets.
</P>
<P>
   North Korea's government has also shown signs recently of
relaxing its hostility toward Western countries, particularly the
United States. In recent months, it has established diplomatic
relations with several countries, including Italy and Australia.
And the U.S. State Department announced ``progress'' in talks
between U.S. and North Korean officials this week in Rome, which
dealt mostly with security issues on the Korean peninsula.

   The rapping (``I Sings''), stomping (``Can't Give Up Now'') and
hand-clapping (first single ``Shackles'') might make it hard to
believe that there's actually serious praising going on here. But
this R&AMP;B-sounding debut doesn't hide its inspiration in ambiguous
lyrics. And while the vocal mettle of this duo only weighs as
heavily as the similar-sounding Mary J. Blige in the lower
registers, those yearning for more youthful and earnest female
voices in this sub-genre should still be ``Thankful'' for these
sisters' arrival.

   The Jayhawks' second CD without former frontman Mark Olson,
``Smile'' lacks the freshness of the band's rough-and-real,
format-bending work from the Olson era. ``Smile'' comprises mostly
slick, familiar-sounding pop. For that kind of thing, it's not bad;
Gary Louris, who wrote or co-wrote all the tunes on the album, can
turn out a ballad with a hook that'll stick with you. The title
track, for example, has a catchy sound reminiscent of regional pop
fave the Connells.

<P>
   That's the lament ``Engines of Creation'' should invoke en masse
among longtime fans of guitar virtuoso Joe Satriani. A postmodern
pastiche that meshes break beats, techno and industrial stylings,
Satriani's latest release proves a disjointed, misguided effort.
``Until We Say Goodbye'' and ``Clouds Race Across the Sky'' sound
most like the Satriani of old; driving guitar solos and deft
fingerwork ring out clearly over seemingly misplaced beats and
loops. If Satriani was going for a concept album, he's got one.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the concept apparently involved using all
available studio gimmickry rather than time-tested talent.

   Here's one for the headbangers. And the Tori fans. And even

this patchwork quilt of music from (and inspired by) ``M:I 2.''
There's something here for just about everyone, but nothing that
really holds it all together. New music from Metallica, Chris
Connell, Tori Amos and Latin-guitar sensation Heitor Pereira make
the album worth the price of admission. And Limp Bizkit lands a
direct hit with ``Take a Look Around,'' a blistering metal-rap
retread of Lalo Schifrin's famous ``Mission: Impossible'' theme.
But the rest of the disc is a wildly inconsistent mishmash of
mostly unmemorable metal.

   The one bright spot on this otherwise middling effort is that
nothing here remotely resembles the Grateful Dead-style space jams
that have (often unfairly) drawn comparisons to Jerry Garcia and
Co. Most tracks are more poppy than trippy short songs that build
on Trey Anastasio's spare fretwork and vocals _ a far cry from the
extended live cuts on last fall's six-disc box set. Now for the bad
news: Phish also seems to have thrown out its usually consistent
songcraft with the jams. And the result isn't exactly fillet. A few
tracks are worth a listen, such as the elegant acoustic
guitar-driven ``Sleep'' and ``The Inlaw Josie Wales.'' But the rest
is Phish filler _ or bait.

 &HT;    Dupri has a keeper in first soundtrack
 &HT;    By Sonia Murray
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Atlanta producer-rapper-label president Jermaine Dupri's first
soundtrack has the kind of singles that last. It begins with a
remix of a song that's already hovered in the Top 10 of the pop,
R&AMP;B and rap charts _ the rubbery ``That's What I'm Looking For'' by
rapper Da Brat. This time her quite capable compadres Missy
``Misdemeanor'' Elliott and Dupri join in.
</P>
<P>
   It introduces a new act on Dupri's So So Def label, named Bow
Wow, which exhibits as much dexterity with a lyric as
million-selling labelmate Da Brat on ``Bounce With Me''; and as
much potential to be a preteen pinup as Dupri's first big find,
Kris Kross.
</P>
<P>
   And most importantly, ``Big Momma's House'' establishes a strong
enough foundation with those first tracks _ including Dupri, Nas
and Monica's kinetic boast over a Peter Gabriel sample
(``Sledgehammer''), ``I've Got to Have It'' _ to weather the
sizable number of weaker offerings that follow (Devin ``I Want to
Kiss You,'' Kurupt, R.O.C. &AMP; Phats Bgossi's ``Radio'').

 &HT;    Multifunctional settings blend pools with the landscape
 &HT;    By Danny C. Flanders
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Jim and Edie Duane had a shopping list of features
when they set out two years ago to create an outdoor living space
in their back yard. Not all of them were in sync.
</P>
<P>
   Jim, who swam competitively in his youth, wanted a pool for
exercise. Edie, an avid gardener, didn't want a big aqua rectangle
to overpower her landscape.
</P>
<P>
   He wanted a detached home office. She had her heart set on a
guest house that would double as a cabana.
</P>
<P>
   Through careful planning, the Duanes created a versatile setting
behind their home that meets all their needs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I learned you can have your cake and eat it too, as far as
having all the aesthetics and being practical at the same time,''
Edie said.
</P>
<P>
   Plenty of others are opting for pool-centered environments as
they extend their homes to outdoors, where they can exercise,
relax, garden and entertain.
</P>
<P>
   ``People want to feel like they're creating their own little
resort in their back yard,'' said Richard Fricker, owner of
Specialty Pool &AMP; Spa of Alpharetta, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   The best designs are in the details.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people, whether (they desire) formal or informal, are
going with pools nestled in an area that gives them yet another
reason for going outside _ additional seating, cabanas, outdoor
chimneys,'' said Phillip Cates of Lifescapes/TruGreen LandCare, a
Canton landscape company.
</P>
<P>
   That total package, including pool, structures, decking and
landscaping, can cost six figures, depending on amenities. Yet
unlike a simple swimming pool, these oases can greatly enhance a
home's resale value.
</P>
<P>
   ``If done well, with a little creativity a pool can make a
property pop and sizzle,'' Fricker said.
</P>
<P>
   These days, ``creativity'' includes finishes that make the pool
look like a pond. Decking that blends the pool into the landscape.
Water features that add soothing sound. Lighting and sound systems
that set a mood. Plants that soften a pool in a garden. Structures
that lend the conveniences of indoors.
</P>
<P>
   Planning makes perfect
</P>
<P>
   The Duanes carved their retreat out of woods on their rural
property near the community of Crabapple in Ga. Until then, their
only outdoor amenity had been a deck.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted more of a mountain pond than a swimming pool, very
secondary to everything else,'' Edie said.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time Jim, a real estate appraiser, was planning a
home office for his second job as a builder.
</P>
<P>
   So the couple decided to first build a guest house at the rear
of their property with a basement that included an office, exercise
area and dressing rooms for their future pool. Jim Lesty of
Lifescapes designed a setting that links the guest house to the
house via a series of hillside terraces that include a pond, pool,
gazebo and garden.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted them to take a 17-year-old ho-hum back yard, make it
into paradise and then border it with a Garden of Eden,'' Edie
said.
</P>
<P>
   Specialty Pool &AMP; Spa created a free-form, or abstract-shaped,
pool with a medium blue surface that complements the surrounding
rust tones of crab orchard stone decking. Short stacked-stone
retaining walls provide natural seating areas, behind which Edie
planted annual and perennial beds that spill with color. On the
highest terrace, a waterfall splashes into a goldfish pond.
</P>
<P>
   The pool's clover-like shape didn't leave Jim much room for
doing laps. He solved the problem by installing a Super Swimmer, a
harness contraption that provides resistance while swimming in
place.
</P>
<P>
   The pool is still large enough for when the Duanes' teenage
daughter hosts a swim party for friends. ``That's one reason we
built this area _ so that we could meet the kids and their
parents,'' Edie said. ``They all love it.''
</P>
<P>
   Follow your garden's style
</P>
<P>
   The Duanes chose a free-form pool with natural stone decking
because they wanted an informal setting.
</P>
<P>
   Choices in a pool's shape, color and materials should be based
on the landscape's design, designers said.
</P>
<P>
   Formal landscapes typically call for rectangular pools, not
those that are kidney-shaped.
</P>
<P>
   Medium blue or gray tones give the pool's surface a
sophisticated feel, bright blue, aqua and white lend a more casual
Caribbean look, while dark tones make for a natural lagoon look.
(Light bottoms reflect the sky, while darker ones absorb the
light.) One popular finish is Pebbletect which contains an
aggragate that disguises the mottling effects of plaster.
</P>
<P>
   For decking, the top choices are limestone, bluestone and crab
orchard stone, said Graham Pittman, an Atlanta landscape architect.
</P>
<P>
   Water features are another must. ``Their sound is undeniably
therapeutic because it provides a sense of tranquility that makes
people want to kick back and relax,'' Fricker said.
</P>
<P>
   Spas and fountains are among the mainstays, but for today's
large pool environments, waterfalls and vanishing edges (also known
as negative edges) are popular. Rock-laden waterfalls help create a
natural setting surrounding a free-form pool, while vanishing edges
most often are used in formal, terraced ones containing rectangular
pools.
</P>
<P>
   In Morgan and Mary Lee Pridemore's northwest Atlanta garden, the
pool extends perpendicular to the rear of their house. At the far
end, water cascades over the vanishing edge, spilling into a trough
on a lower terrace and creating the illusion that the pool is
overflowing.
</P>
<P>
   Carl and Pat Hartrampf love living on the edge _ so much that
they designed their pool so that its spill can be enjoyed from the
front instead of the back. From a statue and fountain, water gushes
into a square pool, then glides over the edge several feet into the
main pool and finally a trough at the base. The effect, when viewed
from their Buckhead house, is a multi-tiered waterfall.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like a ribbon of water,'' Pat said.
</P>
<P>
   Those little extras add up!
</P>
<P>
   Creating a pool environment is like designing an interior: It's
all in the details.
</P>
<P>
   If the pool will be used for entertaining, lighting _ both task
and ambient _ becomes a must. Suddenly, the transistor radio
doesn't do the job so a sound system seems necessary. Depending on
the purpose of the area, structures such as cabanas, gazebos and
pavilions figure into the package, too.
</P>
<P>
   For Calvin and Cindy Thompson, the challenge was to integrate a
number of structures, including a house, detached garage and tennis
courts, around the pool outside their country home in Dallas, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our design criteria included a unique pool area with
waterfalls, water gardens, outdoor fireplace/barbecue area and
gathering areas that could accommodate large parties on a frequent
basis _ all while providing our clients with an intimate,
comfortable surrounding,'' said Cates, whose company developed the
site's master plan.
</P>
<P>
   Lifescapes made the pool area private by lowering it 2 feet and
hauling in tons of boulders to retain the soil and create a
dramatic waterfall. Drainage proved a challenge, so an intricate
system was designed to avoid buildup in the planting areas.
</P>
<P>
   Plants are crucial for blending a pool into the landscape. ``A
pool without landscaping is a concrete hole in the ground,'' Cates
said. ``Landscaping accentuates it and frames the views of the
pool.''
</P>
<P>
   Flower beds were once believed off limits to poolsides because
of chlorine's harmful effects, but advances in nonchlorination
systems allow plants to dangle over the water's edge.
</P>
<P>
   Ask Pat Hartrampf, who insisted on maintaining a dogwood tree
when Superior Pools installed her pool. ``They said you cannot put
a pool under a dogwood, but it was already here and I wanted it,''
she recalled. ``It looks great.''
</P>
<P>
   After all, the pool, which is enjoyed by their eight
grandchildren, is only one element in their garden.
</P>
<P>
   It's that mix of features in a pool environment that comes with
a price. An average 20-by-40-foot pool costs about $40,000 to
$80,000, depending on its bells and whistles, Fricker said. Decking
and hardscaping can cost as much as the pool. Add in structures,
furnishings and landscaping, and projects totaling several
hundred-thousand dollars aren't that unusual.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the amenities that add up because it's like building an
outdoor park in your back yard,'' he said. ``But for many this is
becoming the way of the land _ whether they swim or not.''
</P>
<P>
   Before you dig
</P>
<P>
   Careful planning is the key to creating a pool environment. Here
are some points to consider:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Determine why you want a pool, how you'll use it and how
often. Lifestyle in part dictates the design of the pool and its
surroundings.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Consult a landscape designer for developing a master plan for
your property before adding a pool. A professional can help you
site the pool according to views from both indoors and out.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Determine restrictions on construction. Most cities require
fencing to ensure safety and, because pools are considered an
accessory structure, a permit as well, said Bret Benninghoff of
Superior Pools. Some community covenants also address pools.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Avoid starting a project in spring, when most pool contractors
and landscape designers are busiest. It takes an average of eight
weeks to construct a pool depending on the amenities, Benninghoff
said. ``A day of rain can cost you two or three on a job.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  For information: The National Spa &AMP; Pool Institute offers
consumer guidelines on planning a pool and selecting a contractor.

   Q: Could you please tell me where Oxiclean is sold locally?
</P>
<P>
   _ Ardie McDaniel, Alpharetta, Ga.,
</P>
<P>
   A: This concentrated cleaner can be used for removing such
stains as mildew, algae, juice, pet messes and odors and tile grout
stains. Or simply add a scoop to a load of laundry. Or use it to
clean your dentures, coffeepot, wood deck and ice chest. Pick up a
16-ounce tub of Oxiclean ($9.99) at Linens &AMP; Things in the Peach
Shopping Center, 2900 Peachtree Road N.E., 404-816-2700. For
cleaning purposes, you might consider a $19.99 starter kit (shown)
from manufacturer Orange Glo International. It includes a 16-ounce
tub of Oxiclean and a squirt bottle; a 16-ounce spray bottle of
Orange Glo wood cleaner and polish; a 20-ounce spray bottle of
Orange Clean multipurpose cleaner; and a synthetic chamois cleaning
cloth.

   Q: For several months, I have been trying to find Campbell's
Chunky Manhattan Clam Chowder (tomato based). I had been buying it
at Publix, but they appear to no longer carry it, and I can't find
this soup anywhere else in the Atlanta area. I would appreciate
your help in finding this item.
</P>
<P>
   _ Steven Levy, Atlanta
</P>
<P>
   A: New Yorkers might have an easy time finding this soup, but we
in the South do not. Publix no longer carries the soup, says
spokeswoman Leslie Spencer. However, the soup can be ordered at any
Publix store, at customer service. A 19-ounce can is $2.19.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I've been trying to locate a picture of two little boys in
overalls walking down a dirt road. One of them looks at the other
and says, ``You been farming long?'' I can't remember if this is on
a sign or if it's a poster. Can you please help?
</P>
<P>
   _ Angie Thornton, Cumming, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   A: These ``Little Farmers'' will never grow old. You can
purchase a poster (18 by 14 inches, $4.95) exclusively through the
Country Store catalog: 1-800-558-1013. Or order it on the Internet
at www.countrystorecatalog.com. A plaque is also available _ the
company mounts the poster on a wood base and seals it with acrylic
for a glossy finish ($14.95).
</P>
<P>
   A California woman took the picture of her twin sons in 1978.
(She won third place with the photo at the San Luis Obispo, Calif.,
fair.) Over the years it was used in farm advertising until Roy
Reiman of Reiman Publications obtained the picture for posters.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I have been trying to find DuBarry's cleansing cream. I have
used it for years; it gives my skin such a soft feeling. I had a
source, but they no longer carry it. Help me, please.
</P>
<P>
   _ Carlie Davis, Atlanta
</P>
<P>
   A: In 1903, Richard Hudnut created the DuBarry Co., one of the
first cosmetics giants in the United States. It was named in honor
of Comtesse Jeanne duBarry, who reflected ``the essence of
beauty.'' The products were especially popular in the '40s and
'50s, but fans have remained loyal to this line, which contains all
types of skin-care products. We found an 8-ounce jar of DuBarry's
Cleansing Cream ($10.95) at Barwick's Pharmacy, Briarcliff Shopping
Center, 2724 Clairmont Road N.E. (404-634-3361). Ingredients
include mineral oil, deionized water, beeswax and paraffin.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Recently, I heard that bison meat is reported to be lower in
fat than beef. Is this true and, if so, where can I find it in the
Atlanta area?
</P>
<P>
   _ Brian Eilertson, Atlanta
</P>
<P>
   A: A bison burger or a hamburger? Which should you eat if you
are watching your fat and calorie intake? Bison is the winner. A
4-ounce serving of bison has 124 calories and 2 grams fat while a
4-ounce serving of beef tenderloin has 179 calories and 8 1/2 grams
fat.
</P>
<P>
   You can buy bison at Whole Foods Grocery, 2111 Briarcliff Road
(404-634-7800). Ground bison ($5.99 a pound) is carried all the
time. The store also stocks bison steaks around holidays such as
July Fourth, Thanksgiving and Christmas. Steaks are $18-$19 a
pound.
</P>
<P>
   Harry's Farmers Market, 1180 Upper Hembree Road, Alpharetta
(770-664-6300) carries bison around holidays, including July
Fourth, Thanksgiving and Christmas. Ground is $4.99 a pound; ribeye
and New York strip steaks are $16.99 a pound. Customers can also
special order bison at other times. Call meat buyer Joe Illescas
(770-664-6300, Ext. 3331). Kroger will also special order bison for
you through its meat departments.

 &HT;    Carrey embodies late comic Kaufman
 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   A dizzying look at the mind of comic genius Andy Kaufman, capped
by Jim Carrey's spectacular lead performance.
</P>
<P>
   Carrey's impersonation of the late, prankish Kaufman, a
performer as interested in making people squirm as making them
laugh, is often so pitch-perfect, it's more like channeling than
acting. The movie's title comes from an R.E.M. song about the
comic, and the Athens band wrote the movie's score.

   &QR;  ``Snow Falling on Cedars'' (PG-13) _ Pretty but chilly. Based
on the best seller, Ethan Hawke plays a newspaperman looking into
slaying charges against a Japanese-American. The case rekindles
memories of internment during World War II and Hawke's youthful
romance with the suspect's wife. Beautifully photographed to mask
its thin plot, ``Cedars'' generates little passion and, frankly, is
flatline drama. Grade: C

   &QR;  ``Miss Julie'' (R) _ A mistake. August Strindberg's late
19th-century play was once considered so controversial that it was
banned in his native Sweden. Today, his study of class warfare
spiced with sexual politics seems merely boring and misogynistic.
The aristocratic Miss Julie (Saffron Burrows) initiates a doomed
flirtation with her father's footman, Jean (Peter Mullan). As the
ambitious servant, Mullan has a suitably arrogant and manipulative
presence but Burrows is lamentably weak as the neurotic and
conflicted Julie. Grade: D

 &HT;    Thandie Newton was on scene before ``M: I-2''
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel Gillespie
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   For many mainstream moviegoers, Thandie Newton, Tom Cruise's
co-star in ``Mission: Impossible 2,'' may be a relatively new face.
But there are those of us who've known about _ and pretty much
worshipped _ her for almost a decade. Born in Zaire and raised in
England, Newton has a combination of focus, grace and daring that's
unique among today's young actresses. After you fall for her in
``M: I-2,'' check her out in these pictures.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Flirting'' (1991): Set in two prep schools in rural
Australia in 1965, this film has become best known for featuring a
young, pre-Tom Cruise Nicole Kidman. However, Kidman's role as the
school trophy date is actually secondary (though she does stand
out). The real star is Newton who plays a smart, self-possessed
daughter of an African diplomat forced to endure ugly schoolgirl
``witticisms'' about jungles. When she becomes involved with
another outsider _ a weedy white boy who loves Sartre _ their
relationship poses every imaginable threat to their close-minded,
thick-headed schoolmates. ``Flirting'' was Newton's movie debut.
She was all of 16.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``The Journey of August King'' (1995): The journey in this
underappreciated movie is mostly a spiritual one. Almost biblical
in its 'tis-a-gift-to-be-simple spareness, the picture reunites
Newton with her ``Flirting'' director, John Duigan. It's set in the
mountains of North Carolina in the early 1800s. Jason Patric plays
a farmer who's lost his wife _ and, with her, his sense of who he
is and why he is. Then, reluctantly at first, he helps a teenage
runaway slave (Newton) escape her brutish, vengeful owner (Larry
Drake looking like he fell off the Ugly Tree). Patric, who's done
some scenery chewing in his time (``Speed 2''), gives a lovely,
restrained portrayal. But Newton is the movie. Resisting P.C.
revisionism _ as she did in a similar role as Sally Hemings in the
flawed ``Jefferson in Paris'' _ she never condescends to her
character. It's a performance as breathtakingly delicate as it is
complex.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Besieged'' (1998): This is not director Bernardo
Bertolucci's (``The Last Emperor'') finest hour. Nor is it British
actor David Thewlis' (``Naked''). However, Newton manages to escape
unscathed from this moody fable of a rich, reclusive musician
(Thewlis) who falls in love with his African housekeeper (Newton),
a proud exile who mops by day and studies pre-med by night.
Actually, the film is more bothersome than bad and, being a
Bertolucci work, it can't help but have a few exquisite touches.
The most exquisite, of course, is Newton who, yet again, raises a
problematical role to the level of art. She later said her accent
and gestures were modeled after her mother.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Beloved'' (1998): Maybe it was people had OD'd on Oprah
Winfrey (she was on every magazine cover short of Consumer
Reports). Or maybe it was the three-hour length. Whatever the
reason, ``Beloved'' failed to catch fire at theaters. That's too
bad because this adaptation of Toni Morrison's Pulitzer
Prize-winning novel is a passionate powerhouse of a picture. Think
``Roots'' crossed with ``Poltergeist.'' Winfrey, who produced,
stars as a former slave living in post-Civil War Cincinnati. She
shares her modest house with her shy daughter (Kimberly Elise), her
lover (Danny Glover) and a troubled spirit. ``It ain't evil,''
Winfrey insists. ``Just sad.'' The haunt goes quiet when a
beautiful, childlike creature calling herself Beloved (Newton)
mysteriously shows up and forms an attachment to Winfrey that's
touching and very dangerous. Harmonic convergence note: Newton's
real first name, Thandiwe (she used it in ``Flirting''), means
``beloved'' or ``loved one'' in Zulu.

 &HT;    Kid-friendly sites to inspire future Emerils
 &HT;    By Betty Parham
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   More and more people are realizing that a lot more goes on in
the kitchen than just eating and preparing food. When kids are not
shooed out of the way but allowed to make a real contribution, a
new world of learning that goes way beyond washing and drying
dishes can open up. Reading, math, chemistry, science, physics,
biology, nutrition, history, geography, botany, art and social
science are just some of what kids will be exposed to as they make
their way around the kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   A little hands-on kitchen duty can also lead to increased
self-esteem, personal responsibility, creativity, communication and
just the plain fun and satisfaction of preparing food and having
others enjoy it.
</P>
<P>
   Supervision is the key. By taking the time to supervise your
kids in the kitchen, you will be giving them a rich experience that
will likely stay with them for the rest of their lives. And who
knows? You may even launch a future Emeril or a million-dollar
Pillsbury winner.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet is loaded with sites geared to kids in the kitchen
and parents who want to get the most out of the experience. Here
are a few:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  SAFETY FIRST
</P>
<P>
   First things first. The kitchen is not a playground. There are
fire, electricity, hot surfaces, boiling pots, sharp knives and
implements and any number of accidents waiting to happen. Here are
some sites that every parent should go over.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Hurts and Hazards Kids, Kitchen Accidents and Safety at
www.ext.vt.edu/pubs/preschoolnutr/348-655/348-655.html is put
together by the Virginia Cooperative Extension Service, helping
even the youngest child identify potential hazards.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Along the same lines but geared to older kids is Kids in the
Kitchen Without Catastrophe at
www.familyfoodzone.com/cooking/tip.html. Learn good kitchen habits
early and keep them for life. This site provides common-sense
kitchen guidelines for any age.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  HOW OLD?
</P>
<P>
   Just how young can you start introducing your child to the
kitchen? According to some sites, there are a number of activities
that even a pre-K child can handle.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  About.com's Kids in the Kitchen

Skills for Kids for age-appropriate activities for those as young
as 3. For instance, ages 3 to 6 can easily stir ingredients in a
bowl, wash fruits and vegetables, tear lettuce to make salad and
add ingredients to bowls. Ages 6 to 8 can fill and level measuring
cups and spoons, set the table and beat ingredients with a wire
whisk. Ages 8 to 10 can use a microwave. By ages 10 to 12, kids are
ready to use the oven, use a knife with supervision and use a
grater to shred ingredients. By the time they are 13 to 16, they
are ready to prepare recipes independently. The real payoff begins
when you hear the magic words from your offspring: ``You can relax
tonight, I'll make dinner.''

TONYS A TIME TO LOVE, HONOR, DISOBEY RULES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JEFFREY ERIC JENKINS  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In the odd marriage of commerce and art that is
Broadway theater, June brings the joy of the season. For theater
people, ordinary rites of passage pale in comparison to the
infighting, oddsmaking and lobbying that surround the Tony Awards.
</P>
<P>
   With the broadcast of the first hour of the ceremony Sunday on
PBS, and the final two hours on CBS, the Broadway theater community
looks back over the past 12 months to honor those who make magic in
the 37 theaters that comprise the Great White Way.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the Tony broadcast has seen its audience decline
during the past two decades, it remains the only consistent
national exposure for theater in America. Rosie O'Donnell, whose
syndicated talk show is practically a Broadway-musical worship
service, returns to host the telecast after a hiatus in 1999.
Co-hosting is Broadway veteran Nathan Lane.
</P>
<P>
   Broadway may be the financial pinnacle to which theater artists
can aspire (royalties for writers and composers can run to tens of
thousands of dollars a week), but it is not always the artistic
zenith of the stage. Mainly concerned with musical entertainments,
Broadway has seen plays gradually migrate to off-Broadway _ a
thriving industry of comfy jewel-box theaters with fewer than 500
seats.
</P>
<P>
   Following recent practice, the Pulitzer Prize in drama and the
New York Drama Critics Circle Award for best new play each went to
plays ensconced in off-Broadway houses. Donald Margulies received
the Pulitzer for his hilarious and affecting ``Dinner With
Friends,'' which was directed by former Seattle Rep artistic
director Daniel Sullivan.
</P>
<P>
   August Wilson's 1979 play, ``Jitney,'' although hardly new,
received the drama critics' nod for a work that amply shows the
promise of a developing writer. It also features one of the most
powerful acting ensembles in recent memory.
</P>
<P>
   The single biggest news item to emerge from Broadway this year,
though, wasn't the dearth of plays, the development of two separate
musical versions of Joseph Moncure March's epic poem, ``The Wild
Party,'' or even Elton John and Tim Rice's glitzy new musical for
Disney, ``Aida.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the announcement that ``Cats,'' which opened in 1982 and
has been the long-run champ since 1997, would close on June 25. The
announcement created a bump in ticket demand and caused the show's
producers to extend the run. On Sept. 10, the fat kitty will sing
one last time and ``Cats'' will fade into memory (let's hope) with
a record 7,485 performances.
</P>
<P>
   SOMETHING OLD
</P>
<P>
   Revivals have long been part of the commercial theater tradition
and this season is no exception. Interesting, though, was the Tony
committee's decision to confer ``new play'' status on Sam Shepard's
20-year-old ``True West.''
</P>
<P>
   While it's true the current production is the first on Broadway
_ and the committee made a similar decision regarding the
playwright's ``Buried Child'' in 1996 _ Shepard's best-known play
had two earlier runs off-Broadway. This time, starring independent
film demigods Philip Seymour Hoffman and John C. Reilly, ``True
West'' certainly has easier competition than it would in the
play-revival category.
</P>
<P>
   The play itself is better than the current production, which is
a slick, facile, go-for-the-obvious-laugh approach. Kurt Beattie's
1997 production at the Seattle Rep was much stronger and more
deeply felt. Closing two weeks after the Tonys and sporting four
nominations, ``True West'' is likely to score none.
</P>
<P>
   A play revivals go, this season has been a lively one. A
high-profile production of Eugene O'Neill's ``A Moon for the
Misbegotten,'' also directed by Sullivan, received positive notices
and has performed nicely at the box office.
</P>
<P>
   However, a British production of Tom Stoppard's meditation on
love and art, ``The Real Thing,'' cruises to success on the
strength of David Leveaux's taut direction and finely crafted
performances by Stephen Dillane and Jennifer Ehle. Look for the
revival Tony to go to the O'Neill play and for ``Real Thing''
actors Dillane and Ehle to be honored.
</P>
<P>
   The Tony Award possibilities turn rosier when it comes to
musical revivals. Leading the parade is ``Kiss Me, Kate'' with 12
nominations, including three actors vying in one category. Giving
``Kate'' a run for its best-musical statue is ``Meredith Willson's
The Music Man'' with eight nominations. While there isn't a thing
wrong with Susan Stroman's direction of ``Music Man'' _ it's the
sort of show that gets you to smile and won't let you stop grinning
_ its homespun, apple-pie Americanism doesn't have the appeal it
once did. ``Music Man'' is a delight, but it misses the emotional
nuances offered by ``Kate.''
</P>
<P>
   The other nominees in the musical-revival category, ``Jesus
Christ Superstar'' and ``Tango Argentino,'' are mere window
dressing to fill the group. ``Superstar,'' which opened Easter
week, is a dreadful failure on every level except one: at the box
office. Roundly and deservedly panned by the critics, this revival
of the 1971 Andrew Lloyd Webber and Tim Rice musical seems ignorant
of progress made in recent years, particularly between Catholics
and Jews.
</P>
<P>
   SOMETHING NEW
</P>
<P>
   Broadway's burdens are nowhere clearer than in the categories of
best new play and best new musical. It is always easier to reach
back in time and revive something that has already succeeded. Far
more difficult is the expensive and adventurous process of
developing new work.
</P>
<P>
   This year, Tony voters have tough choices in the ``new''
categories _ for both plays and musicals. In addition to ``True
West,'' the plays include Arthur Miller's ``The Ride Down Mount
Morgan,'' Claudia Shear's ``Dirty Blonde'' and Michael Frayn's
British import ``Copenhagen.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller's entry in this group means that he has plays nominated
in both the new and revival categories (``The Price''). Originally
staged in England nearly a decade ago and then at off-Broadway's
Joseph Papp Public Theater in 1998, ``Mount Morgan'' surveys the
thought process of a bigamist who believes that it suits everyone _
his wives, his children and himself _ if he is ``true'' to himself
by having two distinct lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mount Morgan'' is an oddity for Miller, who spent years
instructing his audiences about the role of morality in society.
Here the playwright cloaks a fantasy of middle age in clever
arguments that rely on the lead actor's charisma.
</P>
<P>
   Since Patrick Stewart has charm in spades, the production shifts
uncomfortably between a repellent point of view and the utter
delight the character (and we) take in his roguish behavior.
Without Stewart's presence, this piece cannot sustain its specious
argument and that's not a good sign for a play. But touts can never
discount a living playwright of Miller's longevity and success.
</P>
<P>
   Shear's ``Dirty Blonde'' is a plausible candidate to snare the
best new play award. With a simple set and three actors playing a
variety of characters, the playwright attempts to unearth the dark
impulses that fed Mae West's lust for stardom. Shear portrays both
West and an actress much like herself in scenes that shift from now
to the distant past when tough-gal Mae trod the boards.
</P>
<P>
   The production is not without its pleasures, but its great
weakness is Shear's portrayal of West. The only time she truly
captures the essence of the great sex symbol is when West has sunk
into her decrepitude. Shear as the young West lacks the necessary
warmth and earthiness that lurked beneath the legend's exterior.
</P>
<P>
   The great discovery in ``Dirty Blonde,'' however, is journeyman
actor Kevin Chamberlin who plays an obsessed film historian with a
fetishistic secret. His performance shows what the play could be if
a more sympathetic performer handled the female role. Playwright,
fire thyself.
</P>
<P>
   In the musical arena, the choices aren't much easier.
``Contact'' is a dance-play; more ballet than musical, it uses
recorded songs.
</P>
<P>
   ``James Joyce's The Dead,'' which won the critics' prize for new
musical, is a play with lots of music. A lovely and haunting work,
``The Dead'' has already begun to tour and may sneak a win as best
musical.
</P>
<P>
   ``Swing!'' probably cannot win due to its revue style _ but at
least the music is live.
</P>
<P>
   Michael John LaChiusa's ``The Wild Party,'' which was unloved by
the critics, may have a slim chance. LaChiusa has toiled in the
musical vineyard for years and has earned a reputation for noble
failures. The drawback for ``Wild Party'' is that a much better
version appeared off-Broadway a month or so before the Broadway
production. LaChiusa also competes with himself for best book and
best score of both ``Wild Party'' and ``Marie Christine.''
</P>
<P>
   Written by Andrew Lippa, the earlier version of ``Wild Party''
closed before attempting a Broadway run when reviews were seen as
too weak. After LaChiusa's Broadway production, though, the critics
seemed to wish they had given more support to Lippa's musical.
</P>
<P>
   SOMETHING BORROWED
</P>
<P>
   In these days of a global economy, it probably doesn't pay to
get worked up over productions that originate in London. Actor's
Equity, however, begs to differ. As with any union, Equity's
mission is to protect the jobs of its membership. Therefore,
whenever a producer wants to bring a member of British Equity to
these shores for a Broadway run, there must be an exchange that
takes an American to London.
</P>
<P>
   Every year, a number of British performances snare headlines and
positive reviews, which leads to more American paranoia. However,
of the 84 nominees this year, only a dozen or so are England-based
and just a handful are expected to win.
</P>
<P>
   A leading candidate for best new play is the British import,
``Copenhagen.'' There are points in this play to make the most
engaged listener glaze over, but the actors battle with passion for
our attention. Although Frayn's play bears more than a passing
resemblance to Sartre's ``No Exit,'' in which three characters
torture one another over the ``truth'' of their existences, the
main attraction of the piece is its intellectual aspiration.
</P>
<P>
   The playwright focuses his tale of love, friendship and betrayal
through the lens of physics. We watch as Niels Bohr and Werner
Heisenberg enact and re-enact a crucial meeting in the 1940s that
has been interpreted again and again in the years since. Bohr, who
provided important assistance to the making of atomic weaponry in
the United States, does a kind of moralizing dance with Heisenberg,
who headed the failed German attempt at creating an atomic bomb
during World War II.
</P>
<P>
   It is interesting, engaging stuff, but almost guaranteed to be a
hard sell on the road. Even with all of the reviews and awards to
date, a recent week saw only 70 percent of the seats filled. Will
it play in Peoria? If it wins best play, the tour operators _ who
are the largest bloc of Tony voters _ will have said, ``Yes.'' The
bet here, though, is, ``No.''
</P>
<P>
   SOMETHING BLUE
</P>
<P>
   Pity poor ``Saturday Night Fever.'' A top draw since its bow
last fall, the musical failed even to earn one nomination for its
Broadway run. Lambasted and dismissed by the critics, the show
circumvented its naysayers and built a healthy advance. The past
few weeks, however, have seen attendance figures drop by 30
percent. It may finally demonstrate that audiences won't be fooled
forever.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lion King'' director Julie Taymor's latest production is an
adaptation of Carlo Gozzi's ``The Green Bird.'' Performed by a
terrific cast who wear Taymor's trademark masks, ``Green Bird'' is
another play that has so much music it might easily be considered a
musical. Cleverly updated by Taymor and Eric Overmyer, the play
seems to be missing something at its core. Awe-inspiring and
beautiful in its theatricality at times, the piece lacks the warmth
and humanity that marked her work for Disney.
</P>
<P>
   So what, finally, is a musical? What is a play? Those
definitions will continue to evolve as Broadway tries to move with
the times.
</P>
<P>
   For now, though, it's time to celebrate the pleasures of the
past season and enjoy watching the winners waltz down the aisle
like freshly minted June brides and grooms.

<P>
   When Tommie Granville and Brad Troxel separated in June 1991,
Tommie was pregnant with their second child. They had never
married, but their Seattle-area family broke into pieces just like
the divorced ones do.
</P>
<P>
   Troxel moved back in with his parents, and Jenifer and Gary
Troxel began enjoying the regular weekend visits of his two
daughters. Then Brad Troxel killed himself in May 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Granville said she was worried about the stress on the girls
when she began trying to limit their visits with their paternal
grandparents. The Troxels hired a lawyer, and almost seven years
later their attempt to force overnight visits with little Natalie
and Isabelle is before the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully, whatever the court's decision is we'll be able to
mend fences,'' Jenifer Troxel said. ``I just wanted to be a part of
their lives when they're young because they're so much fun.''
</P>
<P>
   The Troxels' battle with their grandchildren's mother is not
uncommon due to the shaky status of the American family. As the
divorce rate has climbed in recent decades, and social problems
such as drug abuse have derailed or destroyed parents, more than
2.5 million grandparents now find themselves raising their
children's children, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.
</P>
<P>
   On the flip side are people such as the Troxels who fear losing
their grandchildren when parents split, and a burgeoning
grandparents' rights movement.
</P>
<P>
   All 50 states have laws that allow grandparents to petition for
visitation with their grandchildren, largely due to the lobbying
efforts of the AARP. But the Troxel case out of Washington is the
first to test grandparent visitation law before the Supreme Court,
which is expected to rule on the case by July.
</P>
<P>
   Passions run high in these intense family fights.
</P>
<P>
   Julie Mehring of Illinois has been jailed at least part time for
the past six months rather than consent to a court order forcing
her to turn her 7-year-old daughter, Jenna, over for visits with
the girl's paternal grandmother. The parents' rights movement has
turned Mehring into a hero _ the ``P.O.W. Mom.''
</P>
<P>
   And groups such as the American Academy of Matrimonial Lawyers
(AAML) believe much of this issue boils down to the rights of
children, rather than those of the parents or grandparents _ their
right to have relationships with extended family members.
</P>
<P>
   ``As our generation ages there are going to be many, many more
grandparents,'' said AAML attorney Sandy Ain. ``And because divorce
has become so common, these confrontations are becoming more common
and more litigated _ which is in some respects a sad commentary on
our society.''
</P>
<P>
   Every divorce or death of a parent creates a family situation in
which moms or dads are no longer related to the same family as
their child, said Richard Victor, founder of the national
Grandparents Rights Organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``So how should we define family _ through the eyes of the
adult, or the eyes of the child when we make decisions pertaining
to family rights?''
</P>
<P>
   Groups such as the American Civil Liberties Union fear that the
very concept of grandparents' rights implies a weakness in
nontraditional families such as single parents and gay and lesbian
couples. In most states it is difficult if not impossible to sue a
legally married couple for visitation.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of our concerns was the possible impact (of a Supreme
Court decision) on gay and lesbian parents,'' said Michael Adams,
associate director of the ACLU gay rights project. ``But our
broadest concern was this was a case about parents' rights vs. the
rights of the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most fundamental issue of this case is that decisions
about children have to be made all the time,'' Adams said. ``Who's
going to make those decisions, the parent or the government?''
</P>
<P>
   The mother doing jail time in Illinois has refused to discuss
the specific nature of the disagreement with her daughter's
grandmother. But Mehring told the St. Louis Post-Dispatch that she
considers her incarceration _ eight hours a day, after which she's
allowed to return home _ a ``mother's sacrifice.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to remind people this isn't an argument between two
people. This is about the government going over a parent's head,''
Mehring said. The Washington law being scrutinized in the Troxel
case is broader than the grandparent visitation statutes in other
states, and provides that anyone, whether related or not, can
petition for visitation rights to serve the best interest of the
child.
</P>
<P>
   Because it is so broad, it opened the door for a myriad of
parties with competing agendas to file friend-of-the-court briefs
on how and when the government should be allowed to weigh in on
decisions made for children by their parents.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have been many petitions to the Supreme Court on this
issue, but we were the first case to hit all the issues squarely,''
said Troxel attorney Mark Olsen. ``We had a constitutional issue, a
very broad-based statute, so any ruling would apply to virtually
all the states.''
</P>
<P>
   Victor is frustrated that the Supreme Court is testing the issue
of grandparents' rights in a law unique to the state of Washington.
The clause that allows ``any person, at any time'' to sue for
visitation is simply bad law, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you test a law in an attempt to make public policy, you
really should have a law that is generic, or at least reflective of
the rest of the country,'' Victor said.
</P>
<P>
   The high court could simply strike down the ``any person, any
time'' language as unconstitutional, Victor said, a ruling that
would have no effect in any state but Washington and on no
grandparents other than the Troxels.
</P>

   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   What parents' rights groups and the ACLU are seeking is that the
court change the burden of proof most commonly used in grandparent
visitation cases to one that requires the grandparents to prove
that a child would be substantially harmed if they are not allowed
to visit. ``It's a nearly impossible burden of proof,'' Victor
said.
</P>
<P>
   The prevailing standard in most states leaves it up to the
individual judge to determine if court-ordered visitation by
grandparents is in the ``best interest of the child.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the nine Supreme Court justices considering the Troxel case,
six are grandparents. Justice Clarence Thomas was raised by his
grandparents. Jenifer and Gary Troxel believe that their
granddaughters will be harmed emotionally by separation from their
grandparents. But they have no complaint with how their
granddaughters are being raised, only the amount of time their
mother allows them to spend with the girls.
</P>
<P>
   Jenifer Troxel said she thinks that she and her husband serve as
a reminder of a life the girls' mother wants to leave behind.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think she thought she had made a mistake by having a
relationship with our son,'' Troxel said. ``She wanted to begin a
new life.''
</P>
<P>
   The girls' mother, Tommie Granville, married Kelly Wynn shortly
after the district court judge first ordered grandparent
visitation. Wynn adopted the girls in February 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like she thought we were going to hinder her
relationship,'' Troxel said. ``And all we want to do is know our
son's girls.''
</P>
<P>
   In an open letter seeking help with legal expenses before the
Supreme Court heard arguments in January, Kelly Wynn and Tommie
Granville Wynn wrote, ``The Troxels were upset by visitation
arrangements we asked them to accept during a very stressful period
in the girls' lives. At the time, Natalie was 3 and Isabelle was 18
months.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Troxels wanted to have overnight visitation every other
weekend and holidays and part of the summer,'' according to the
Wynns. ``We asked them to begin with one Sunday a month and hoped
we could begin to build on that.''
</P>
<P>
   The Troxels filed suit, and won court-ordered visitation of one
weekend a month, one week in the summer, and four hours on each
grandparent's birthday. But the Wynns appealed, and the Washington
Supreme Court ultimately ruled that the law allowing ``any person,
any time'' to petition for visitation was unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   The Troxels then appealed that verdict to the U.S. Supreme
Court, which heard arguments in the case in January.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having experienced the reality of unnecessary court
intervention in our personal family, we believe that this
interference is completely wrong,'' the Wynns wrote.
``Grandparents' support is always welcome, but court-ordered
visitation is not supportive.''
</P>
<P>
   Troxel said they were still seeing the girls at the time that
she and her husband filed suit, but felt like those visits were
getting fewer and farther between. They decided they had better sue
before the visits disappeared altogether, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Relations between the Troxels and the Wynns are strained, at
best, the grandmother said. She said she sends Natalie and Isabelle
cards and letters, but she and her husband have not seen the girls
in more than a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if we just have to start out with a couple of hours,
we're willing to try anything,'' Troxel said.

 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: I have to cut some rectangular openings for electric outlet
boxes in the middle of a sheet of plywood.
 &HT;    I've done this by first drilling a starting hole for the blade
in each corner of the outline, then using a small tapered handsaw
to cut around the outline.
 &HT;    However, I now own an electric sabre saw and have been told that
there is no need for drilling a starting hole _ the blade can start
its own hole if properly used.
 &HT;    I tried this but broke the blade.
 &HT;    Can you tell me the right way to get such a cut-out started
without having to bore any starting holes first?
 &HT;    A: Tip the saw's base all the way forward so that its front end
rests on the plywood with the tip end of the blade not quite
touching the wood along one side of the penciled outline.
 &HT;    Turn on the saw and slowly tilt it back down onto the plywood
and allow the reciprocating blade to start scratching the surface.
 &HT;    Keep lowering the base of the saw until its blade cuts through
the plywood and the saw's base is flat against the surface of the
wood, then proceed to cut along all four sides of the outline.
 &HT;    You can make angled cuts from one side of the outline to the
other when necessary to cut out square corners without having to
make any more starting cuts.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: Our old bedroom dresser which is covered with mahogany wood
veneer has a bad cigarette burn on the top.
 &HT;    Stain will not cover up this black scorch mark and the veneer is
burnt off in a small area.
 &HT;    Is there any way you know of that I can cover up or patch the
veneer in order to make the stain less noticeable?
 &HT;    A: The best way would be to cut out the damaged section of wood
veneer and then fill in with another piece of matching wood veneer.
 &HT;    Since finding a matching piece of veneer is not easy, your best
bet would be to use a razor blade and metal straightedge to cut out
a small piece of the original veneer from an inconspicuous surface
on the same piece of furniture _ along a hidden side or near a back
corner.
 &HT;    After cutting out a rectangular patch, lift it off carefully by
sliding the razor blade under the veneer.
 &HT;    Place this piece on top of the damaged section and move it
around until its grain pattern lines up with that of the veneer
under it.
 &HT;    Then tape it down and use the razor to cut through both layers
of veneer at one time _ that is, the new patch and the damaged
veneer under it.
 &HT;    Lift off the top piece and peel out the piece of damaged veneer,
then glue the new piece down in the cut-out just made.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: Our house has a crawl space instead of a full basement and
this space has an uncovered dirt floor.
 &HT;    There are signs of mildew showing up on the exposed floor joists
in this crawl space, and there is a musty odor that is starting to
seep up into the house.
 &HT;    What can I do to correct this condition?
 &HT;    A: The dirt floor should be completely covered with sheets of
heavy plastic to keep moisture from seeping up into the house.
 &HT;    The sheets should overlap at least 6 inches where they meet, and
bricks or stones should be put on top to hold the seams in place.
 &HT;    The plastic should also lap up onto the foundation walls by 6
inches on all sides and you should make sure there is adequate
ventilation of the crawl space to avoid condensation problems.
 &HT;    Vents are needed in the foundation walls on all four sides.
These should be large enough to provide at least 1 square foot of
unobstructed opening for every 300 square feet of floor space (if
vents have louvers and screens they must be twice as large).
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: The main sewer pipes inside our basement are made of PVC
plastic.
 &HT;    They make a lot of annoying noise each time we flush one of the
upstairs toilets.
 &HT;    The plumber says that we have a proper vent system that is not
plugged, so there is really nothing he can do.
 &HT;    Can you suggest anything?
 &HT;    A: The noise you hear is the sound of water rushing through the
drain pipes each time the toilet is flushed. This is not unusual
with plastic drain lines that are exposed.
 &HT;    The only suggestion I can offer is to ``box in'' or enclose
these pipes by first wrapping them with acoustical insulation and
then enclosing them with plywood or drywall panels.

 &HT;    CLINTON WARNS OF 'URGENCY IN MIDEAST, SUPPORTS SHARED OF MISSILE
DEFENSE
 &HT;    (600&AMP;ADD)
 &HT;    Moving in both (i) International and (w) Washington categories.

<P>
   LISBON, Portugal _ Trying to press Palestinian and Israeli
leaders toward a long-sought peace accord, President Clinton warned
Wednesday that Israel's surprise withdrawal from Lebanon last week
has added ``a new sense of urgency,'' to the search for peace in
the troubled Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   ``It changed the landscape,'' said Clinton, who spoke by
telephone Wednesday with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and was
to meet Thursday here with Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak.
</P>
<P>
   ``It both turns the tension up in all camps, and increases the
overall price of not reaching an agreement fairly soon,'' Clinton
told reporters. ``It changes everything, in a way that both
increases the pluses and increases the potential minuses.''
</P>
<P>
   Separately, Clinton said he supports sharing the benefits of a
proposed national missile defense system beyond U.S. borders, to
American allies and other nations that are committed to controlling
the spread of nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said such benefits could even extend to Russia, adding
that it would be ``unethical'' to deny the protections of advanced
missile defense technology to countries that see eye-to-eye with
the United States on nuclear nonproliferation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have always said that ... every country that is part of a
responsible international arms control and nonproliferation regime
should have the benefit of this protection,'' said Clinton.
``That's always been my position.''
</P>
<P>
   His remarks were made in response to questions at a news
conference following a summit here with Portuguese Prime Minister
Antonio Guterres and European Commission President Romano Prodi.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's comments on national missile defense came a week after
Texas Gov. George W. Bush, the presumptive Republican presidential
nominee, said a U.S. missile shield should be far more
comprehensive than the system Clinton has proposed, adding that it
should also protect Israel and other U.S. allies from a rogue
missile attack.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, though, said he had long favored protection for other
countries, and not only U.S. allies. Further, he suggested that the
same was true for Vice President Al Gore, on track to become the
Democrats' presidential nominee.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think that we could ever advance the notion that we
have this technology designed to protect us against a new threat
... to other civilized nations who might or might not be nuclear
powers, but were completely in harness with us on a
nonproliferation regime, and not make it available to them,''
Clinton said. ``I think it would be unethical not to do so.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's always been my position and I think that is the
position of everyone in this administration,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Appearing in the gardens of Portugal's stately Palacio Nacional
de Queluz, Clinton, Prodi and Guterres all hailed the strength of
U.S-European relations. They announced a host of low-octane
agreements, mostly reaffirming previous policies such as support
for stability and democracy in the Balkans, implementation of an
earlier accord protecting American companies from data piracy on
the Internet and a determination to work out trade disputes through
the World Trade Organization (WTO), rather than engaging in
tit-for-tat transatlantic trade skirmishes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We decided also that megaphone diplomacy will be replaced by
telephone diplomacy,'' Prodi said. ``It is more constructive, even
less sexy.''
</P>
<P>
   There was agreement, also, on a broad U.S.-E.U. initiative to
combat AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis in poor countries and a
strengthening, the three leaders said, of the security ties binding
the two continents.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was not a business-as-usual summit,'' Guterres said. ``It
was a stragetic summit.''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Begin optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   U.S.-European summitry was overshadowed, however, by the two
most ambitious foreign policy challenges Clinton is likely to face
in his remaining months in office _ the question of whether to
build a national missile defense system and the search for an end
to half a century of enmity and war in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is weighing whether to build a limited national missile
defense system that would help defend the U.S. from a ballistic
missile attack from so-called ``rogue states,'' unpredictable and
considered a potential danger to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon plans to test the key technology _ using a U.S.
missile to intercept and destroy an incoming enemy missile _ in
July and to make recommendations to Clinton, probably by September,
as to the advisability of installing a powerful set of radar
stations in Alaska, along with 100 interceptors. At a cost
estimated at between $26 billion and $60 billion, that system would
be able, supporters claim, to protect the entire United States from
a trans-Pacific missile attack of limited order.
</P>
<P>
   The matter will be near the top of a crowded agenda when Clinton
travels to Moscow Saturday for two days of summitry with Russia's
new president, Vladimir Putin.
</P>
<P>
   Russia opposes the missile defense system, which it regards as
undercutting the deterrent value of its own nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he hopes to explain to Putin that such a system
could be a tool for stability and even added security for both
countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've done a lot of information sharing already with the
Russians,'' Clinton said. ``We have offered to do more, and we
would continue to.''
</P>
<P>
   The administrations of Putin and Clinton agree that a missile
defense system would require changes to the Nixon-era
Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) Treaty, which restricts defense
shields of both nations as a way to deter systems that could fuel
an arms race.
</P>
<P>
   The two leaders are also in the opening stages of talks over a
third Strategic Arms Reductions Treaty (START), with Russia
favoring deeper cuts than the United States is so far prepared to
accept.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he didn't expect to resolve either issue during
this weekend's visit _ his first with Putin since the former KGB
officer was elected president two months ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would be surprised if we resolved all of our differences on
the question of missile defense, although we might make more
headway than most people expect,'' said Clinton. ``Sometimes it's
most important to be talking when there's still unresolved
differences.''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is hoping, on a separate front, to help bridge
differences between Israelis and Palestinians. With negotiators
from both sides set to meet in Stockholm Thursday to resume
working-level peace talks, Clinton is hopeful that he can host
Barak and Arafat for a face-to-face summit in the coming weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The two Middle East leaders are working to resolve their
outstanding land-for-peace issues _ including such tough matters as
the future of Jerusalem, the question of Palestinian statehood and
the right of Palestinian refugees to return to Israeli-held lands _
by September 13.
</P>
<P>
   Recent Israeli-Palestinian violence in Gaza and the West Bank
have raised doubts about the men's ability to make that deadline.
</P>
<P>
   Barak's surprise decision last week, though, to pull Israeli
troops out of southern Lebanon, ending an 18-year occupation, has
sharply shifted the dynamic, said Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The move was ``a daring one, which creates both new challenges
and new opportunities,'' said Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``It also imposes a much greater sense of urgency,'' he said.
``I think the consequences of inaction are now likely to be more
difficult because of this move.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton telephoned Arafat immediately after his press
conference, White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said, then Clinton
dashed off for a round of golf on a course 20 minutes outside of
Lisbon.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is scheduled to meet with Barak in Lisbon Thursday
morning, before journeying to Berlin, stop two on a week-long swing
that takes him to Russia this weekend. On Monday he travels to the
Ukraine before returning to Washington late that night.
</P>
<P>
   Barak had originally planned to meet with Clinton in Berlin, but
Clinton said an Israeli holiday would prevent that.

every conceivable threat weapon for weapon or division for

</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush, in leading the Republican charge against the
Clinton-Gore record on military matters, is attempting to step out
from the shadow of John McCain, a Vietnam POW and his former
primary foe. Bush, by focusing on defense issues just ahead of
U.S.-Russia arms talks, also is hoping to counter his lack of
foreign policy experience compared to Democratic opponent Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   . . . AND RAISING MORE MONEY
</P>
<P>
   All the stops on George W. Bush's four-day trek through the West
will prove fertile _ with money. Bush reaped an estimated $100,000
at a luncheon in Denver, and another $300,000 for the Republican
National Committee and $125,000 for the New Mexico Republican Party
at a reception in Albuquerque. By week's end, after visits to
Arizona and Nevada as well, Bush should collect $350,000 for his
own campaign, $200,000 for state GOP organizations and about $2
million for the national committee, campaign officials said.
</P>
<P>
   A PUSH ON MENTAL HEALTH . . .
</P>
<P>
   In an unusual joint campaign appearance with wife Tipper today
in Chevy Chase, Md., Al Gore proposed requiring insurance companies
to cover mental health services for children under the same
co-payments and deductibles used for other health benefits. He also
called for special mental health training for all new teachers and
promised to fight for strong patient rights to privacy. Gore said
his child-only insurance proposal, like his plan for universal
health insurance for children, would help build momentum for what's
called ``parity'' in benefits for all patients.
</P>
<P>
   . . . AND PLAYING UP THE PERSONAL
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore's campaign schedule is reflecting an attempt to
highlight the personal stories of his life. Today, he and wife
Tipper discussed mental health and Mrs. Gore talked about the
depression she suffered in 1989 after her son, then 6, was almost
killed in a car accident. On Thursday in Atlanta, Gore will speak
out for the privacy and treatment rights of people with cancer,
which killed his older sister in 1984. Friday's topic, in
Washington, is fatherhood. On Memorial Day, he told veterans about
his decision to enlist in the Army and volunteer for Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   POP QUIZ
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Senate candidate wants to boost public education,
protect the environment, wire up schools to the Internet and
protect health benefits for the disadvantaged. Oh, and no
mudslinging on the campaign trail. It's all about issues. Who is
the candidate? Republican Rick Lazio or Democrat Hillary Clinton?
Both. For all of the talk of stark differences, the congressman is
espousing many of the same themes that the first lady has embraced
in her 10 months on the campaign trail.
</P>
<P>
   CO-OPTING THE CENTER
</P>
<P>
   Starting a first full day of campaigning aboard his ``Mainstream
Express'' bus today, Republican Rick Lazio said his race against
Hillary Clinton was ``a struggle between somebody on the far left
and somebody in the center.'' The Long Island congressman, the
unanimous pick of his party's state convention, said he had given
the bus its nickname ``to reinforce my record in the House, which
is a mainstream record, which is, I think, where the vast majority
of New Yorkers are.''
</P>
<P>
   MCAIN LIKING WHAT HE SEES IN BUSH . . .
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush's recent statements on arms-control policy,
missile defense and trade with China have drawn hearty praise from
John McCain. In a Wall Street Journal opinion piece, McCain
applauded Bush for embracing internationalist positions that
benefit America's interests. Now, McCain lamented, if only more
Republicans in Congress would follow Bush's lead. McCain is
shunning Bush's three Arizona fund-raisers today, though, because
of those ``soft money'' donations he's campaigned against.
</P>
<P>
   . . . AND SPREADING HIS MAGIC IN CALIFORNIA
</P>
<P>
   John McCain is endorsing Tom Campbell for Senate in California,
a move Campbell hopes will boost his appeal to fellow Republicans
and non-Republicans alike. McCain and the GOP congressman from
Silicon Valley were appearing together today for the announcement.
Campbell is aiming to unseat second-term Democratic Sen. Dianne
Feinstein.
</P>
<P>
   BUT IT'S BUSH'S STATE, ANYWAY
</P>
<P>
   The Reform Party, with its roots in the presidential campaigns
of Dallas billionaire Ross Perot, will not be on the statewide
ballot in November. The party notified the state's elections
division that it would not file a petition to place its candidates
on the ballot. Kelly Abt, a member of the party's national
committee from Texas, said the two major parties made it too
difficult for his party, which has never been on the ballot, to get
on this year.
</P>
<P>
   A ROLE FOR MADISON AVENUE
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush is turning to an executive of one of the nation's
best-known advertising agency, Young &AMP; Rubicam, for creative
suggestions on TV spots. Jim Ferguson, the ad agency's chief
creative officer, has accepted an unpaid, advisory role in the
campaign, said Stuart Stevens, a Republican consultant and a member
of Maverick Media, the advertising arm of the Bush campaign.
Stevens said Ferguson will assemble an informal group of people in
New York who may be asked to help write Bush's TV ads.
</P>
<P>
   SIERRA CLUB RESERVATION . . .
</P>
<P>
   A Sierra Club board member wrote colleagues six months ago to
urge they not endorse Al Gore, arguing the vice president had a
``tawdry environmental record'' and left natural resources
``hostage to the highest bidder. With this legacy, no real
environmentalist could ever endorse Al Gore,'' Michael Dorsey wrote
in an internal e-mail copied to Gore. The message was released by
the Republican National Committee. Six months after the e-mail, the
Sierra Club is airing $250,000 worth of ads criticizing George W.
Bush for his environmental record in Texas, but has not endorsed
Gore.
</P>
<P>
   . . . AND THE SENTIMENT IS SECONDED
</P>
<P>
   A pioneer in the environmental movement joined Sierra Club board
member Michael Dorsey in criticizing Al Gore's ``tawdry
environmental record.'' David Brower, the club's executive director
in the 1950s and1960s, said that when he resigned from the board
earlier this month he urged that they support Ralph Nader. ``The
other two (presidential) candidates are really the same color'' on
environmental issues, and ``it's too bad,'' the 87-year-old Brower
told the Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   CLOSE TO THE VEST ON VEEP
</P>
<P>
   For all the speculation, George W. Bush says only two other
people know what's going on in his thinking about a running mate:
his wife, Laura, and Dick Cheney, who is heading the search. Asked
about the process, Bush scoffed and said, ``Total gossip.'' He said
his wife is simply interested in the process, while he and Cheney,
a former secretary of defense, speak regularly to plot strategy.
Bush suggested that some of the speculation is fueled by the way he
reacts to suggestions: ``I say, `I appreciate that piece of
advice,' and all of a sudden that becomes `inside information.' ''
</P>
<P>
   ANYBODY SEEN BRADLEY?
</P>
<P>
   After withdrawing from the presidential race March 9 and
offering Democratic rival Al Gore his support but not his outright
endorsement, Bill Bradley has disappeared from the national stage.
There have been no public comments or events, no fund-raising or
campaigning for congressional candidates. And there has been no
get-together to make peace with the man who pummeled him in the
primaries. Bradley aides said the former senator is still living in
Montclair, N.J., getting ready to close his campaign office and
trying to figure out what to do with his life.
</P>
<P>
   READ HER LIPS: NEW TAXES
</P>
<P>
   New Hampshire Gov. Jeanne Shaheen said she plans to run for a
third term _ but won't renew her pledge to veto an income tax.
Failing to take the pledge to veto broad-based taxes historically
has been a kiss of death in New Hampshire. But there's a changed
landscape this year: an education funding crisis triggered by a
1997 court ruling that demanded they find a fairer way to pay for
schools, and other candidates are campaigning for an income tax as
the means to do it.
</P>
<P>
   MOSCOW ON THE HUDSON?
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey Senate hopeful Jim Florio lashed out at Democratic
rival Jon Corzine for using private detectives in their primary
campaign. Florio claimed operatives hired by Corzine's attorney
called several of his staff members asking for personal information
about him, his family and key advisers. Florio, a former governor,
said the investigators were involved with the campaign against
tobacco company informant Jeffrey Wigand. ``It sounds like the
KGB,'' Florio said. Corzine, an ex-Wall Street executive, said he
was unaware his attorney, Stanley Arkin, had hired the sleuths.
</P>
<P>
   PRETTY PRICY CHEAP EATS
</P>
<P>
   For the famished at the Republican convention in Philadelphia,
$165 will buy a ``Snacks and Junk'' basket, with a dozen Tastykakes
and a dozen soft pretzels, a bag each of Oreos, chocolate chip
cookies and potato chips, and six Hershey's chocolate bars and six
bags of peanut M&AMP;Ms. For the really hungry, $249 will fetch a
2-foot-long Italian hoagie, plus a quart each of pasta and potato
salads, a dozen Tastykakes and a dozen pretzels. Aramark, the
exclusive caterer, also will feed Democrats at their convention in
Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ACROSS THE CANADIAN BORDER, THEY'RE CHEAPER
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Slade Gorton (R-Wash.) formally began his re-election
campaign with a five-day bus tour of the state. Gorton, 72, vowed
to make the rising cost of prescription drugs a centerpiece of his
campaign. He's introduced a bill that would bar drug manufacturers
from charging Americans more for prescriptions than they charge
patients in other countries. A September primary will determine
Gorton's Democratic opponent, either state Insurance Commissioner
Deborah Senn or former Rep. Maria Cantwell, now an Internet
executive.
</P>
<P>
   WATCH OUT! HERE COMES THE WEASEL
</P>
<P>
   Rep. George Nethercutt (R-Wash.), who can thank the term-limits
movement for helping him unseat House Speaker Tom Foley in 1994, is
running for a fourth term despite his promise to serve only six
years. Cartoonist Garry Trudeau dubbed Nethercutt ``Weasel King''
in ``Doonesbury'' last year, and since then George the Weasel King,
a costumed, crowned animal character sponsored by U.S. Term Limits,
follows Nethercutt around, taunting him. U.S. Term Limits says
Nethercutt is one of three members of the congressional class of
1994 who broke term-limits pledges. The others: Marty Meehan
(D-Mass.) and Scott McInnis (R-Colo.).

GLIMPSES INSIDE A WORLD BARELY IMAGINED BY MEN 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sun., June 4) 
 By MOLLY HASKELL    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Love is a minefield, but women would rather blow up than be
single,'' says the unflappable heroine of ``Love and Sex,'' Valerie
Breiman's romantic comedy (opening in August) that could be the
female response to ``High Fidelity.'' Kate (Famke Janssen), the
movie's Don Juanita, casts an eye over the loves of her life,
affectionately sending up the pretenses of men as she surveys
sexual warfare in the trenches from a survivor's-eye view. She has
emerged bloody but unbowed, having withstood even a traumatic
childhood passion which in the film's hilarious opening flashback
locates the love-hate roots of screwball comedy squarely in the
playground.
</P>
<P>
   Two 12-year-olds are mutually smitten, but only one of them _
the girl, of course _ can admit it. To protect her beloved's
reputation as an officially girl-hating male, little Kate allows
Bobby to call her names and shove her in public so that his
tough-guy buddies won't know he's in love.
</P>
<P>
   She then loses him when her own best friend rats on her and
reveals the couple's trick. ``Among the many differences between
man and woman when it comes to love,'' the now older and wiser Kate
says ruefully, ``is women's need to tell the world every little
detail.''
</P>
<P>
   The need to discuss love and sex from a female point of view
coupled with a new freedom to do so would seem to be the launching
pad of a gaggle of women-directed movies, many of them first films,
that take us behind the scenes to a world barely imagined and
perhaps not entirely welcomed by men. It's a world of whispers and
confidences and giggles and tears, a great many gradations of
sensuality, from the barely understood to the actively carnal,
along a wide spectrum of appetites and longings; a portrait of sex
that differs from the male variety in being both sadder and more
humorous. Colette Burson's ``Coming Soon,'' a female
rite-of-passage and right-to-orgasm film that opened last month,
might be the ``she said'' version of the ``he said'' teen picture
`American Pie,'' or a prep school prequel to HBO's ``Sex and the
City.'' A trio of seniors, best friends, discuss orgasms, boys and
getting into college, trying to sort out their relative importance.
</P>
<P>
   In ``The Virgin Suicides,'' Sofia Coppola's recent magical
adaptation of Jeffrey Eugenides' 1993 novel, the five Lisbon
sisters share such an intense togetherness in their feverish,
cloistered adolescence that they are like a single organism.
</P>
<P>
   Not only the attitudes, but the actresses in these made-by-women
movies defy conventional male and Hollywood criteria for
seductiveness and sex appeal. The heroines aren't always the
glamour pusses of movie-star gloss or men's wishful thinking.
</P>
<P>
   Kirsten Dunst, as the sexually precocious 14-year-old Lux
Lisbon, is lovely, but closed off and opaque in her bafflement, and
the other three sisters (after the death of the youngest, Cecilia)
are appropriately blurred, almost indistinguishable. Where a male
director might have selected five ready-for-my-close-up babes for
the roles, Sofia Coppola has managed to cast and direct them as a
collective, girls whose tragedy is precisely that they never had a
chance to become remarkable or individual.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Coming Soon'' (with a screenplay by Burson and Kate Robin),
Stream, the main character, is played by the freckled and often
scruffy Bonnie Root. She is less stunning than one sidekick _
Tricia Vessey, a comically depressed beauty who becomes a model _
but more straightforward than the third member of the trio, Gaby
Hoffman's unhappily overweight sexpert who mingles lies and bitter
truths in a defensive response to the constant and combined
pressures of college entrance and orgasmic ecstasy. In her
determination to find out what the fuss is all about, Stream is no
shy blossom waiting to be plucked but an intrepid explorer, testing
her reactions against the alleged experiences of her friends; nor
does she suffer the consequences that once lay in store for good
girls who strayed from the straight and narrow.
</P>
<P>
   Famke Janssen's Kate in ``Love and Sex,'' a writer and editor at
a women's magazine, is model-tall but real-woman funny, a
lay-it-on-the-line type of heroine who shows the disadvantages of
being a string bean among peas and butter beans. As the little girl
who conspires in her oppression on the playground, she's 6 inches
taller than the swaggering tot boyfriend she worships, and the guys
never catch up.
</P>
<P>
   On their first date, the artist (Jon Favreau) who becomes the
love of her life says, ``You're the tallest woman I've ever
known,'' then has the gall to ask her shoe size.
</P>
<P>
   The two connect with the spacey, goofy eroticism of a Woody
Allen-Diane Keaton couple, and Janssen and some of the other odd
enchantresses of recent women's movies _ Hilary Swank and Chloe
Sevigny in Kimberly Peirce's ``Boys Don't Cry,'' Kate Winslet in
Jane Campion's ``Holy Smoke'' _ represent a new type: attractive
enough to make demands, but neither coy nor narcissistic. ``This is
what I want. What do you want?'' they seem to say.
</P>
<P>
   French movies, which have always found sexiness and fascination
in a wider range of women, have recently featured such offbeat
stars as Sandrine Kiberlain and the versatile, dark-haired,
pale-skinned Karin Viard, who is mesmerizing in two women's films,
Solveig Anspach's ``Haut les Coeurs'' (shown at Rendez-Vous with
French Cinema at Lincoln Center in March), where she plays a woman
struggling with breast cancer, and Catherine Corsini's ``La
Nouvelle Eve'' (at Rendez-Vous last year), in which she's a
terrorista of love.
</P>
<P>
   The girls in ``The Virgin Suicides'' range in age from 13 to 17,
roughly the equivalent of the boys across the way whose narration,
in book and film, charts the girls' brief lives and mysterious
deaths. Yet despite a strict upbringing in which their repressed
and domineering mother (a brilliant Kathleen Turner, tight-lipped
and inscrutable) has isolated them from any socializing outside of
school, the girls are nevertheless, and typically, light years
ahead of the stumbling, gawky guys who adore them from afar. Yet
their poise and maturity are in some sense a sham, a mask or at
least a veneer, intimidating to the boys, but only on their home
ground where they form a united front.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   Their family is collapsing from within, a plant poisoned at its
roots. Lux, the only one who does get out, who speaks for herself
or who asserts her desires, gets violently punished, and her
sisters along with her. In the '70s, when the story is set, a woman
who is free with her favors is branded a tart. Just how different
is it today? This question and its implications serve as the
thematic motif of most of the teen films, whether guy or chick
oriented.
</P>
<P>
   But where guy films hinge on a binary system as rigid as a
computer, the women's films take a more nuanced approach to sex and
its permutations, and the varying degrees of enthusiasm for it.
They refuse to be pinned down by the coitus-or-bust philosophy, or
the either-or vision of women as tarts or virgins, straight or gay,
lusty or prudish. In Gil Junger's ``Ten Things I Hate About You''
(1999), one of the few male-directed teen films that allows its
heroine to talk back, Julia Stiles brazenly ridicules the
monomaniacal and hormonally indiscriminate male. ``Oh, yeah, let's
do it in the back seat right now!'' she says, her sarcasm letting
the guys know just how charming their idea of nirvana is to her.
</P>
<P>
   If there is a common enemy in these films, it's not the men but
the cheerleader view of sex perpetrated by the women's magazines.
In ``Coming Soon,'' Stream memorably lashes out at the very idea of
the Cosmo girl, and at the other extreme, in ``The Virgin
Suicides,'' Lisbon has banished all such magazines from the house.
As Eugenides writes, ``Mrs. Lisbon had never given the girls beauty
tips, and forbade women's magazines in the house (a Cosmo survey,
`Are you multiply orgasmic?' had been the final straw).''
</P>
<P>
   In their relentless and mechanistic focus on sexual
satisfaction, these magazines have put women on the spot, ratcheted
up the pressure to experience constant and fulfilled sex lives.
``What about liking the guy?'' the girls in ``Coming Soon'' wonder.
</P>
<P>
   Interestingly, Burson's ``Coming Soon'' had a hard time finding
a distributor, almost got an NC-17 rating (with behavior far less
sexually graphic than that of ``American Pie'') and seems to have
earned unusually hostile reactions not only from men in the
industry but from male critics who complain of its
``amateurishness.''
</P>
<P>
   Hearing women talk about sex makes men nervous, like those
giggling groups of girls in high school _ and high school hovers
over the proceedings like a bad dream; having constructed an
identity that passes as adult, confident in the world, we don't
want to revisit the trauma of anxiety and rejection. It was one
thing for guys in movies to tell dirty jokes in the locker room,
compare notes on the sexual attributes of various girls, take bets
on getting some and rate girls on a scale of one to 10.
</P>
<P>
   But they didn't bargain for the reverse, for getting rated in
return. The idea of the sexually insatiable woman was a delirious
fantasy that in reality posed only terror for the man who might not
be able to satisfy. Hence the pathologizing of female promiscuity
as nymphomania _ a term that, as Carol Groneman points out in her
fascinating new book on the subject, ``Nymphomania,'' has undergone
almost comical permutations according to each of the anxieties and
misogynies in society's ever-changing view of acceptable female
behavior.
</P>
<P>
   In ``The Decline of the American Empire' (1986), the Canadian
director Denys Arcand's wonderfully even-handed and now-classic
dark comedy of the sexes (he also wrote the screenplay), the
endlessly voluble and confessional women discuss their affairs with
each other, just like their husbands and lovers.
</P>
<P>
   When the moment comes, a woman knows just how to drive her man
crazy: ``Jean, I love you; with Jacques it's nothing but sex ...''
Women were supposed to be the sweeter sex, the redeemers _ or, if
sexual, the entrappers, responsible for man's downfall.
</P>
<P>
   Male anxiety over independent women often translates into a
demonizing of the sexually spirited female. In ``Fatal
Attraction,'' Glenn Close comes on to poor Michael Douglas like a
harpy in heat, and more recently in the Danish film ``Mifune,'' in
a gratuitous and surprisingly nasty scene, the hero is stunned on
his wedding night by his bride's unbridled lust.
</P>
<P>
   There have been films over the years that give us glimpses of
that once taboo subject _ young women's sexual initiation _ but the
predominant view of the mating experience, especially in the
hormonally driven teen-age years, has been male. A notable
exception was Amy Heckerling's ``Fast Times at Ridgemont High''
(1982), a funny, poignant adaption of Cameron Crowe's story about
surfers and make-out artists in Southern California which showed
the holy grail of sexual initiation as something more shadowed and
equivocal where the girls were concerned. As in Heckerling's
glorious ``Clueless'' (1995) and her forthcoming ``Loser'' (with
Jason Biggs and Mena Suvari), the director exhibits a genius for
getting into the heads and libidos of a whole gamut of high school
types, male and female, nerds and royalty.
</P>
<P>
   Eugenides, the novelist, shows in ``The Virgin Suicides'' the
same extraordinary ability to imagine life from both sides of the
fence in his portrait of five girls who baffle and entrance a group
of boys. Looking at them from across the street, collecting
mementoes when they are gone, the guys probe, pry, spy and try to
imagine the lives of human beings so close to them and yet so far,
and finally realize the very limits of understanding. In a line
lifted directly from book to film, ``We felt the imprisonment of
being a girl, the way it made your mind active and dreamy.'' In her
astonishingly subtle evocation of that bevy of sisters, Coppola
(who wrote and directed) captures both the mystery and the
yearning, and finally the sense of the hiddenness of all lives, of
differences and similarities between male and female which make the
struggle to understand both so difficult and so endlessly
compelling.
</P>
<P>
   Possibly the movie's most charming and revealing scene occurs
when the boys and girls go on a group date to the prom _ the Lisbon
sisters' first and only social outing. All crammed into the same
car, the boys are stunned to hear the girls talking about
everything from one neighbor's house improvements to another's
rumored Nazism. That these creatures who existed only in pantomime,
wafting lyrically and mysteriously behind glass windows, were in
reality chatterboxes who had looked out just as the boys had looked
in, radically alters the voyeuristic equation. The awesomely
unknown, silent Female of romantic illusion suddenly and
confusingly mutates into four living and breathing girls, voluble,
idiosyncratic, full of opinions, human beings not so different from
themselves. That is, until the sisters merge again in death, and
are once again silenced, now by the deep freeze of memory: forever
young, forever fair, virginity intact.

SOFTWARE TO PREDICT POWER NEEDS 
</HEADLINE>
   By IAN AUSTEN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   If nothing else, most American computer users have been able to
count on one thing: electricity to run their machines. But high
demands for electricity this summer could produce power shortages
like those in parts of the country last year.
</P>
<P>
   A recent study led by the Sandia National Laboratories, however,
concludes that one remedy for the nation's overburdened power grid
may be rethinking the software that oversees it.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very difficult time for the electrical industry,''
said Mark Ivey, principal member of the technical staff at Sandia
and a co-author of the study for the Department of Energy. ``A lot
of people out there are just running to stay ahead of the next
emergency. They don't have the time to sit back and think.''
</P>
<P>
   The study, with the unwieldy title ``Grid of the Future White
Paper on Accommodating Uncertainty in Planning and Operations,''
suggests that utility planners and operators begin using software
that judges the probability of risks to the power system.
</P>
<P>
   Ivey compares the programs to the Eight Ball toys, which contain
a floating polygon with different predictions printed on each of
its facets. When the ball is tipped over, only one prediction is
revealed at a time through the window on the bottom.
</P>
<P>
   Risk assessment software involves inserting scenarios of
everything that can go awry on the power grid into a computer,
rather like putting the predictions inside the Eight Ball. Then,
using a variety of factors, sophisticated software could calculate
how frequently and under what circumstances each of the scenarios
would pop up.
</P>
<P>
   Corporations use probability predicting software to manage
production, but Ivey said that most of it was not sophisticated
enough for the extremely complex power grid.
</P>
<P>
   ``The grid is sufficiently specialized that it's going to take a
directed, concentrated and expensive effort to get something that's
useful,'' Ivey said.
</P>
<P>
   Many players in the power grid that serves more than 400 million
people in the United States, Canada and Northern Mexico have not
modified the software they use to plan and control the network, he
added.
</P>
<P>
   Ivey, who is also working on a climate change research project,
said that he was concerned by the way power companies use weather
data from the past 10 years and data on the past year's electricity
demands in determining future power needs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The planner at one utility told me that to forecast future
demand she takes last year's numbers and adds a factor to them,''
he said. ``That kind of backward looking approach is getting people
into trouble. With the changing complexity of the grid, we're
heading for a problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Even small miscalculations in forecasts can mean trouble. A
difference in demand of 1 percent for most parts of the grid (it is
broken into several segments across the continent) could represent
the entire output of a major generating station, Ivey said.
</P>
<P>
   One starting point being explored at Sandia, a Department of
Energy laboratory that is operated by a subsidiary of Lockheed
Martin, is software that is currently used to analyze the
reliability and maintenance of nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   But Ivey said that any software would encounter major
statistical problems without some changes in industry habits. A
competitive utility market has made many electrical companies
reluctant to part with statistics for fear the data will be used by
competitors. And much of the data that they do release proves to be
outdated or inaccurate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just getting information is a challenge,'' Ivey said.

 &HT;    Spring home checkup
 &HT;    By James Cummings
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ It's time to go out looking for trouble.
</P>
<P>
   A house is thousands and thousands of individual parts that work
together to keep you comfortable and safe, and there's a good
chance dozens of those parts need maintenance, repair, replacement
or general sprucing up right now.
</P>
<P>
   Your job, now that it's warm enough to spend a few hours
outside, is to take a close look around the house to figure out
what needs attention and how badly. Once you've done a thorough
inspection trip, you can prioritize and give yourself a good to-do
list.
</P>
<P>
   Today we'll list some of the important things you should check
and give you some tips on how to check them. We'll save tips on
correcting most of the problems you might find for another day.
</P>
<P>
   LAWN AND LAWN TOOLS
</P>
<P>
   While walking across the lawn, notice the feel of the ground.
Freezing and thawing sometimes creates spongy soil. You also may
notice mole trails that appear as raised lines of grass.
</P>
<P>
   Some lawn care experts suggest running a roller over a spongy or
mole-damaged lawn. Others prefer an aerator that takes plugs out of
the soil to improve water and fertilizer penetration.
</P>
<P>
   Go with aeration if the lawn has a thatch layer more than
1/2-inch thick. Thatch is the tightly intermingled layer of living
and dead stems and other plant parts that develops between the
grass and the soil surface.
</P>
<P>
   To measure the thatch layer, cut a plug of the lawn a few inches
deep with a shovel. You'll see how thick the thatch is by looking
at the plug from the side.
</P>
<P>
   You also may run across a few insect larvae buried near the
surface. You won't be able to do much about the grubs now, but make
note to deal with them in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   If you have small bare spots scattered around the lawn that were
green last summer, you may have a crabgrass problem. Larger bare
spots usually indicate bigger problems.
</P>
<P>
   Now's a good time to spread a pre-emergent crabgrass agent over
the lawn. It will kill the young crabgrass plants before they take
root firmly.
</P>
<P>
   Check your garden hoses for leaks and cuts. Attach a sprayer to
the end of the hoses, but leave the sprayer closed when you turn on
the water.
</P>
<P>
   Leaks at connections can usually be fixed by replacing hose
washers, but hoses with splits or breaks should be replaced to
avoid wasting water. Save the damaged hoses; you'll find lots of
uses for lengths of rubber tubing cut from an old hose.
</P>
<P>
   If you have a sprinkler system, turn it on and see if it's
working properly. If it has a timer, set the clock to trigger the
system to be sure it turns on and off when it's supposed to. An
elaborate professionally installed sprinkler system may need
attention from your irrigation contractor.
</P>
<P>
   Check your lawn mower if you haven't used it yet. Use a paint
scraper to clear any clipping residue stuck inside the mower
housing. Then scrape the inside of the housing with a wire brush.
</P>
<P>
   While cleaning, examine and tighten all the screws and bolts and
make sure all the switches, levers, pulleys and other control
devices are moving properly.
</P>
<P>
   Before you use your lawn mower, sharpen the blade, change the
oil, replace the spark plug, clean or replace the air filter and do
other maintenance tasks the owner's manual suggests.
</P>
<P>
   Also fire up your other lawn equipment _ weed trimmers, hedge
trimmers, power saws, etc. You may still be able to beat the worst
of the spring rush at repair shops if you find a problem soon.
</P>
<P>
   DECKS, WALKS AND DRIVES, LIGHTING
</P>
<P>
   Examine wooden decks and fences. You probably will wait for
spring rains to pass before cleaning and resealing your outdoor
wood, but structural repairs can be handled earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Check all joints and fasteners on the deck; they should be
secure and free of rust. Look for deck nails that are working
loose. You might want to replace them with screws. Are the posts
that support the deck showing any signs of decay?
</P>
<P>
   To see if your deck will need to be resealed this year, toss a
bucket of water on the deck when it is dry (no rain in about three
days). If the water beads, you're in good shape for this year. If
it soaks in, you'll need to apply a sealer.
</P>
<P>
   On your wooden fences, look for loose boards, popped nails,
``weep'' lines under nails, discoloration and rotting wood.
</P>
<P>
   Concrete walks and driveways and asphalt driveways naturally
develop cracks. Large cracks will have to be repaired to keep large
holes from developing, but whether you deal with hairline cracks is
up to you. Some people ignore them, although others insist that no
crack is a good crack.
</P>
<P>
   Look for a smooth, even black surface on an asphalt driveway. If
the surface is discolored or if pebbles clearly show, you probably
need to apply an asphalt sealer.
</P>
<P>
   On walkways, look for evidence that tree roots are lifting the
pavement. Roots can create dangerous breaks that will trip
unsuspecting walkers. Breaks are especially dangerous in winter
when they're difficult to keep free of snow and they're difficult
for pedestrians to see.
</P>
<P>
   Check any landscape lights you have running along the walks and
driveways. Turning the lights on for a daytime inspection may mean
resetting a timer or disabling a light sensor.
</P>
<P>
   Check the course of the wires leading to landscape light
fixtures. Are the wires in danger of being unearthed and exposed to
lawn mower blades?
</P>
<P>
   Check your porch lights and security lights. Turn them on and
look for burned-out bulbs or flickering fluorescent light tubes.
</P>
<P>
   After dark, check such things as motion sensors. Do the lights
come on as expected as you approach?
</P>
<P>
   SIDING
</P>
<P>
   Paint on wooden siding deteriorates over time and must be
periodically replenished. Examine painted siding for peeling,
flaking, bubbling and powdering. Also look for rusting nails and
gaps around seams and openings or rotting and damaged boards.
</P>
<P>
   If your paint job has gone bad less than five years after the
last painting, seek advice from a seasoned professional before
repainting. You may need to correct some underlying problem to make
your next paint job last.
</P>
<P>
   Look for dark blotches or spots on the walls. If the spots fade
when wiped with bleach, you have a mildew problem.
</P>
<P>
   Aluminum siding also deteriorates over time, although not as
quickly as paint. If your siding is more than 15 years old, look
for fading and chalking. If the original color layer has failed,
exposing unprotected metal, you need to act quickly to repaint it.
</P>
<P>
   Brick, like other sidings, can develop a salty white coating.
The white residue is caused by moisture passing through the brick,
so you must find and fix any leaks or sources of condensation that
may be causing moisture to make its way into the masonry.
</P>
<P>
   WINDOWS, DOORS AND AIR CONDITIONERS
</P>
<P>
   The points at which the frames of your doors and windows meet
the siding should be caulked to keep air from passing through
cracks around the frame. Caulk can harden and crack over time, so
check all the frames for problems.
</P>
<P>
   Also check the putty that holds the glass part of the window in
its wooden frame. Dry, hard, cracking window putty should be
replaced.
</P>
<P>
   The window frames themselves usually show stress at the joints
first, and all hardware and home-improvement stores sell metal
corner plates to shore up loose frames.
</P>
<P>
   While checking the airtightness of frames on your doors and
windows, don't forget the door of your attached garage. Keeping
some of the cold air out of your garage reduces the heat loss
through walls adjacent to the garage in winter and help. Sealing
the garage in summer reduces the cost of air conditioning.
</P>
<P>
   Check that exterior doors are equipped with sweeps, which seal
the area where the bottom of the door meets the threshold. Replace
broken or brittle sweeps.
</P>
<P>
   Carefully examine all locks and tighten any loose screws. Assess
whether additional locks are needed; good deadbolt locks should
protect all entry doors.
</P>
<P>
   Inspect all screens for holes. If you have the kind of screens
that are removed and replaced with storm windows in the winter,
check the screen frames to see if they need repair or painting.
</P>
<P>
   If you have central air conditioning, also inspect the outside
condenser unit. Leaves and other debris should be cleared before
the first use. Also trim shrubs or plants that crowd around the
condenser.
</P>
<P>
   The system should be inspected professionally once a year in
most cases. Check your owner's manual for tips on how often your
unit should be serviced.
</P>
<P>
   When you install window air conditioners, be sure they fit
snugly in the windows. If you find gaps around the unit or between
window sashes uses weatherstripping materials to seal them.
</P>
<P>
   Most units have a removable front filter. Check the filter
before turning on the unit, and clean it if necessary. If the
filter is frayed or otherwise deteriorated, replace it. Clean the
filter at least once a month this summer, or more often if your
owner's manual says so.
</P>
<P>
   Make sure your clothes dryer is set to vent outdoors, and be
sure the vent cover is working properly. Clean accumulated lint
from the lint exhaust system.
</P>
<P>
   ROOF AND GUTTERS
</P>
<P>
   The top is as good a place to start as any, so we'll start at
the chimney and work down.
</P>
<P>
   After a hard rain, go up to the attic to examine the underside
of the roof deck using a flashlight to check unlighted areas. Poke
with a knife or screwdriver to locate wet, darkened or
deteriorating wood on the ceiling beams or rafters. If you find
any, trace the moisture path back to its origin. This may be
difficult; the steeper the roof's pitch, the farther the moisture
can travel from its entry point to where it has collected.
</P>
<P>
   Next, turn off the lights and look for pinholes or cracks of
daylight in the roof surface. When you find the leak, measure its
location in relation to a reference point such as a chimney or vent
stack. This will help in locating it from the top of the roof.
</P>
<P>
   Take a look at the chimney if it passes through the attic. It
should be sound without deteriorating plaster or bricks.
</P>
<P>
   Outside, start in the yard with a pair of binoculars on a strap
around your neck. Look with your bare eyes for problem areas, then
use the binoculars for a closer look.
</P>
<P>
   When looking at your chimney, check for cracks, missing bricks,
deteriorating plaster or signs of water damage. If you have a
chimney that runs up the side of the house, check its entire
length.
</P>
<P>
   Is the top of the chimney equipped to keep out birds or other
animals or is there evidence animals have entered?
</P>
<P>
   Check the fireplace damper and close it if you're through using
the fireplace for the season.
</P>
<P>
   On the roof, worn shingles may have dark spots where the
granules on their surface have washed off. Another sign of roof
problems are shingles that have curled at the edges.
</P>
<P>
   If your house has wooden shingles or shakes, check for curled,
warped and split shingles. Also look for stains from rusted nails
or shingles that have become loose. On slate or tile roofs, look
for breaks or loose roofing material.
</P>
<P>
   Flashing is the metal plating around chimneys, skylights, vents
and other holes through the roof. It should be flat and rust-free,
and the sealing material around its edges should be smooth and
intact.
</P>
<P>
   After looking up from the ground, position your ladder for a
closer look at the roof and the gutters.
</P>
<P>
   Check the gutters and look for evidence of leaks, rust and
depressions where water might collect. Also check for loose
connections between gutters and downspouts and for loose nails or
brackets.
</P>
<P>
   If you wish, you can clean debris out of your gutters now or you
can wait until the trees near your house have shed their blooms and
seed pods later in the spring. Remember that even if your gutters
are screened, small plant debris will still get in, and you have to
occasionally remove the screens to clean the gutters.
</P>
<P>
   Spray the roof with a garden hose and make sure water coming out
of the downspouts is carried two feet or more from the house and
that the lawn slopes away from the house at least a little where
the water is released.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, check out the hammock or patio lounger. By this time
you deserve an inspection that can be done from a prone position.

 &HT;    Classic Rock
 &HT;    By James Cummings
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Written in stone. Solid as a rock. Resting on
bedrock.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing says permanent, substantial and dependable like stone,
so it's no wonder that people seeking to shape the landscapes
around their homes often turn to natural or manufactured stone.
</P>
<P>
   Local landscape designers and home-improvement materials
suppliers say various kinds of landscape timbers are still in use,
but stackable concrete blocks have become the first choice where
walls are needed to hold and shape the earth.
</P>
<P>
   Walls serve several functions in landscaping. They can prevent
the erosion of a hillside and turn a steep slope into a series of
level terraces for gardening. They can provide an elevated area
within a flat landscape for special treatment such as a rock
garden. They can define spaces and provide visual interest. And a
wall can provide protection, creating a sturdy, solid barrier near
driveways or other traffic areas.
</P>
<P>
   Denise Walsh, owner of the landscape design firm Garden Images,
said one reason for the increasing popularity of stone walls is
that much of the land being used for home building in recent years
is not as flat as traditional housing land.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, housing development in the Dayton area has occurred
on former farm fields that are generally level. Now that much of
that kind of land has been consumed, housing developers are forced
to use land with more ravines, hills and other dips and rises.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whenever I see a hillside on a property that is very steep,''
Walsh said, ``I always think of a concrete block wall. They're
great at stabilizing the land and preventing erosion.''
</P>
<P>
   She said she favors natural stone where the grade is not as
severe. It's harder to build a wall of natural stone, but Walsh
said the results can be very attractive.
</P>
<P>
   Walsh worked with Springboro homeowners Ginger and John Kennedy
to create a two-tiered limestone wall that looks almost like a
naturally occurring stone outcropping.
</P>
<P>
   Ginger Kennedy said she and her husband had their Springboro
house built about five years ago, and her husband built a stone
waterfall and pond with a stone border in their small back yard not
long after. John Kennedy gathered the stones for the waterfall and
pond border from around the subdivision, which was still being
developed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had the yard landscaped, but we were never really happy
with it. It was just kind of boring,'' Ginger Kennedy said.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy said her husband contacted Denise Walsh, and their ideas
for a system of retaining walls in the small, sloping yard meshed
perfectly.
</P>
<P>
   To create a wall that looked natural took lots of planning and
preparation, Walsh said. Building a stone wall involves a lot more
than stacking rocks on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   The garden wall is made of irregularly shaped slabs of
limestone, some of them about 3 feet across and weighing up to half
a ton. And almost half the stones in the layout are buried out of
sight.
</P>
<P>
   As with all walls, construction started with excavation. The
plants in the Kennedy landscape were removed and set aside for
reuse, and trenches were dug where the two wall sections were to be
installed.
</P>
<P>
   While her crews were digging the lower trench, Walsh said,
ground water that had been trapped under the Kennedy's patio gushed
into the hole, creating a little pond. She had to add a drainage
system including a buried well to catch the excess water that
tended to pool near the patio.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Kennedys said the soil near their patio had always been
soggy,'' Walsh said. ``One thing you never want to do is try to
build a wall in a mud hole.''
</P>
<P>
   After digging and providing an outlet for the ground water, the
next step was providing a level base of porous gravel under the
wall. Gravel under the wall improves drainage and eliminates the
freezing-and-thawing cycle that can deform a wall over time.
</P>
<P>
   The final step was setting the stones themselves and adding the
right combination of small stones and dirt to make the wall stable.
Like most stone walls, the Kennedy project was built without
mortar. Gravity and the surrounding soil keep the wall in place.
</P>
<P>
   With a wall of regularly shaped concrete blocks, positioning is
fairly simple. Positioning irregular stones is an art form.
</P>
<P>
   ``Building this kind of wall is like working on a puzzle,''
Walsh said. ``I had the guys working with me lay out a few stones,
then pick some up and try a different arrangement. It's very time
consuming and labor intensive.''
</P>
<P>
   Rob Petrosino used concrete blocks for the area around his
backyard swimming pool. But he said the work on the 150-foot
retaining wall was still back-breaking.
</P>
<P>
   ``Make sure you've got a good pair of work gloves on if you try
something like this,'' Petrosino said. ``I was sore all over; my
thighs were bruised from bouncing blocks against my legs. Not only
were we wrestling with those 60-pound blocks, but we had to shovel
about 20 tons of gravel.''
</P>
<P>
   Petrosino bought his house six years ago and has been adding
features one at a time for years. He first installed a swimming
pool, then he added a large deck and gazebo. This year the
retaining wall goes in, and next year it's to be a picnic shelter
followed by final landscaping.
</P>
<P>
   ``My neighbors kid me that I never do anything small,''
Petrosino said.
</P>
<P>
   The Petrosino house and pool are elevated somewhat from the land
behind the house, and Petrosino is using the retaining wall to
divide the property into zones of differing heights.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the slope of the yard, some portions of the wall are
four blocks high while others are only one block high. But the top
of the wall is level from end to end.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no way I could have laid it out on my own and had it
come out right,'' Petrosino said. ``I had an architect plan it, and
Judd Powell used the plan to design the actual wall.''
</P>
<P>
   Powell owns Tom's Mulch, and he worked with Petrosino on the
project. Petrosino did ``a lot of the grunt labor,'' while Powell
did the planning and the detail work.
</P>
<P>
   The detail work included cutting away portions from the backs of
some blocks so they could be fit into curves.
</P>
<P>
   Petrosino said he bought about 600 blocks and the company
delivered the blocks on skids of about 50 that were scattered
around his yard. He said he drove a forklift to move the blocks
around.
</P>
<P>
   Concrete stacking blocks are designed to be stacked in staggered
rows, side by side in a straight line. Generally the underside of
each block is made with protrusions or grooves that make it sit
firmly on top of the blocks underneath. The protrusions also make
each row of blocks sit slightly further back than the row
underneath.
</P>
<P>
   To create curves, the builder often has to chip away part of the
protrusion and cut the sides of the blocks into angles.
</P>
<P>
   As with the Kennedy project, Petrosino said the trickiest part
of the job was not placing the blocks but preparing the ground. A
series of trenches had to be excavated and leveled, and the work
was especially tricky at the points where the level of the wall
changed from two blocks thick to three blocks thick, for example.
</P>
<P>
   Powell said he used a base of ``chips and dust'' under the wall.
Chips and dust is a combination of small pebbles and chips of rocks
surrounded by loose dry dirt. He said the dust helps create a firm,
level surface while the pebbles provide drainage.
</P>
<P>
   Petrosino said that after each level of the wall was installed,
the area behind it was filled with gravel. The blocks are partially
hollow, and the gravel flows into the spaces in the blocks to help
anchor the wall.
</P>
<P>
   The last step of the construction was the addition of a row of
decorative capping stones.
</P>
<P>
   Petrosino said he's pleased with the project now that it's
nearly complete, but he said it has been a lot of work.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did most of the lifting and placing blocks on a Saturday,
and the next day it rained so we couldn't work,'' he said. ``I was
never so glad to see a rainstorm in my life.''

 &HT;    A rich bounty of salad greens
 &HT;    By Ann Heller
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ June is somewhere between asparagus and green
beans.
</P>
<P>
   It's a month best-known for fruit, with an abundance of local
strawberries and raspberries. A few peas show up at farm markets,
but not enough for dinner for all of us.
</P>
<P>
   What June does offer to meet our need for green vegetables is
salad greens. And this year, after a cool May, the crop is
bountiful.
</P>
<P>
   We've come a long way since a green salad meant just lettuce.
When Guy Ashmore takes his salad greens to the Saturday Waynesville
Farmers Market, he may include peppery arugula, lemony sorrel,
vibrant Russian red kale and frilly mizuna in the mix.
</P>
<P>
   At the Yellow Springs farm market, Doug Siebert of Peach
Mountain Organics sells bagged mixes that change from week to week.
They may include exotica such as tiny leaves of Bright Lights
chard, Bull's Blood beet greens, pretty leaves of red orach or
small green leaf amaranth, snow pea tendrils and salad burnet.
Radicchio, two kinds of endive and frisee add a contrasting bitter
edge.
</P>
<P>
   Siebert rattles off the crops, mentally walking through his
fields, which also produce red and green Russian kales, and
sometimes Italian broccoli raab. An organic farmer in a constant
battle with bugs, he may be able to harvest peppery broad leaf
cress, Japanese mizuna and spoon-shaped tatsoi. Arugula is a staple
addition, and herbs such as flat leaf Italian parsley, celery-like
lovage and feathery bronze fennel have a place in the mix. He even
tucks in brightly colored nasturtium flowers and the plant's
peppery leaves as well, and a scattering of petals from the orange
yellow calendula blossom.
</P>
<P>
   All of which means salad has moved light years beyond a wedge of
iceberg lettuce, or, at its spring best, a bowlful of tender leaves
clipped from a back yard patch of Black Seeded Simpson leaf
lettuce.
</P>
<P>
   These days salad greens are multicolored. And the farm market
combinations are the trend-setters that have moved beyond the
mesclun mixes sold routinely at every supermarket.
</P>
<P>
   The attraction is the variety of taste and texture _ and a
pumped-up nutritional profile.
</P>
<P>
   Eating iceberg lettuce is about the nutritional equivalent of
drinking a glass of water. The darker the greens, the more
nutritious they are in terms of vitamins, minerals, fiber and
phytochemicals.
</P>
<P>
   The colors of these ``greens'' range from deep burgundy to
blue-black. The tastes are often assertive, which is why they are
usually mixed with milder lettuce such as heirloom varieties of
Speckles and Freckles or crisp Green Ice. Mixtures can pack
surprises with each bite, making salad an adventure.
</P>
<P>
   But the season is limited. Many of the varieties can't stand
heat of midsummer and disappear from markets until fall. So enjoy
the salads this month. Pretty soon it will be time for beans.
</P>
<P>
   Putting a dressing such as blue cheese or Thousand Island on the
tender leaves of a farm market mesclun mix is too heavy-handed.
There are lighter dressings that complement the sometimes delicate
leaves. Vinegar and oil vinaigrettes are the best choices, but
there are lots of ways to add flavor to that basic mix.
</P>
<P>
   Here are a few choices.
</P>
<P>
   BASIC VINAIGRETTE
</P>
<P>
   Makes 1/2 cup
</P>
<P>
   1 clove garlic, minced
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon kosher or coarse sea salt
</P>

   This is a good dressing to use when adding shavings of Parmesan
cheese, crumbles of blue cheese, nuts or slivers of smoked meat to
the salad.

   The addition of Dijon mustard not only adds flavor but helps
emulsify the dressing. When using mustard, remember to blend the
mustard with the vinegar before adding the oil. If you add the
mustard last, the dressing will not be smooth.

&HT;     SAY HELLO (AND GOODBYE) TO `CLERKS' 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By TIM GOODMAN  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Even with a show that reeks, that offends the senses as you
watch every pathetic minute of it, you're not completely sure of
its demise.
</P>
<P>
   That is because everybody else might like it. Look how long
``Veronica's Closet'' was around. A hit, no matter how horrible,
remains a hit. Nobody cancels shows in Hollywood just because they
are bad.
</P>
<P>
   That said, a really solid case can be made that ``Clerks,'' the
new animated series from ABC is, in effect, DOA.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clerks'' is indeed a spin-off of the popular independent cult
film of the same name. Creator Kevin Smith and his band of actors
from that picture are behind this animated effort. And a brave
number of stars have lent their voices to the show, a la ``The
Simpsons.''
</P>
<P>
   That's a decent pedigree. Why then the absolute certainty that
``Clerks'' is dead? Let's enumerate.
</P>
<P>
   1. ABC decided to put the show on when the TV season was over.
Not a good sign. In fact, that's dead fish wrapped in paper,
delivered to the rival mob.
</P>
<P>
   2. Kevin Smith, upon hearing when his show _ the one he'd
labored over for a full year _ was going to debut after the season,
went into a huge rant on his personal Web page. There was much
anger and verbal stench. Word of those words leaked into the press,
and ABC, as clueless as it is most times, took notice. It's pretty
hard to get your show renewed when you assault the network.
</P>
<P>
   3. ABC is, truly, clueless. And instead of trying to cash in on
what has been a pretty lucrative market _ young males _ filled most
of its half-hour slots with shows deemed unwatchable by both
genders. Besides, this is the network that didn't know how to make
money off ``Sports Night,'' and canceled the riveting series
``Wonderland.''
</P>
<P>
   4. Animated shows are falling out of favor.
</P>
<P>
   5. ``Clerks'' essentially draws on what is a limited audience _
cult hit movie or not _ and almost no network is interested in
gambling on niche programming, much less in patiently growing the
audience.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, ABC went after ``Clerks'' in the first place because of
Smith, who has scored well with ``Chasing Amy'' and ``Dogma'' as
feature films and is revered among certain types as some sort of
alternative pop culture genius.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the aforementioned five reasons may not have
played into the future of ``Clerks'' even if it was given a
24-episode run. This animated show, centered on slackers working at
a convenience store and its neighboring video store, lacks the raw
pop of the film and relies instead on inconsistent jokes that try
to prop up premises that don't exist.
</P>
<P>
   Whereas ``Seinfeld'' got the erroneous rap of being a show about
nothing, ``Clerks'' manages to prove that you can make 22 minutes
with virtually no ideas.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the appeal of the show, actually, is watching them
stretch to fill the time with one-liners, flashbacks and random
bits desperately thrown together.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Clerks,'' time is something that doesn't exist, and hanging
out and talking nonlinear nonsense is a breezy way to kill a
half-hour. But there's not enough to keep you interested _
particularly if you know there are only going to be six episodes
(and that's if ABC is generous). Maybe if there was a no-kill
clause to the show, you'd cut it some slack and learn to get its
vibe.
</P>
<P>
   But as it stands now, ``Clerks'' is filled with jokes that will
offend minorities. The movie didn't have a wide-enough appeal to
prepare TV audiences for this kind of 'tude, and the actions of
these animated characters aren't drawn broadly enough to present a
series of scathing offend-everyone jokes while getting away with it
by wink-winking.
</P>
<P>
   So we're left with a partially amusing, very offensive,
completely doomed summer series. For true ``Clerks'' fanatics only.

SUMMER FINALLY COMES _ BUT AT A PRICE
</HEADLINE>
 (for use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CATHERINE NEWTON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   I envisioned a column about the dawn of summer. A
Letterman-esque Top 10 Reasons to be Glad It's Here, packed with
silly, somewhat ironic vignettes about the glories and challenges
of summertime when you have children. You know, lemonade stands
where you do all the work. Fire ant bites and bee stings. Constant
anxiety about listening for the ice cream truck.
</P>
<P>
   I was forming said column in my mind and planned to write it one
evening after work in the comfort of my study (otherwise known as
the room taken over by Barbie and her pink plastic prefab
township), where screened windows let gentle breezes cool the air.
</P>
<P>
   But the school year was not yet inclined to release me from its
cruel talons. I arrived home at 7 to find my friend Brittany _
temporary after-school sitter extraordinaire _ on the phone and son
Jack in tears. Apparently, he had forgotten about his fourth-grade
life science projects.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, he'd made the ant farm and had been toting the jar around
for weeks. And he'd designed, in remarkable detail, a fictional
creature that looked like a flying turtle and had all sorts of
special adaptations to nature. He had just forgotten all the other
projects, he said. All 14 of them. All due the next day.
</P>
<P>
   I thought he was joking. But the alarm in Brittany's voice was
clear as she explained the situation to me in-between brief,
staccato bits of one-sided conversations with her
encyclopedia-graced fiance, in which he informed her exactly what
you call a baby hog, a female goat and a male sheep.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mom already drove us around hunting for leaves,'' she
explained, pointing to a pile of leaves on the kitchen table. ``She
kept pulling over to the side of the road, and if anyone saw us she
would shout, `We're not bad people. We're just working on a little
boy's science project!' ''
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, Brittany and her mother had been attacking the
project list for hours. My first instinct was to throttle my child
and go watch some season finales, but on careful reconsideration,
this seemed a bit selfish.
</P>
<P>
   I grabbed the assignment sheet. And screamed.
</P>
<P>
   There were four chapters' worth of work with 12 projects each,
and the students were assigned to do four projects from each
chapter. I decided to start at the beginning and work our way done.
</P>
<P>
   Chapter one, project one. ``Soak 20 bean seeds in one cup of
water for 24 hours. Chart how much water is soaked up.''
</P>
<P>
   Moving right along to project two. ``Grow a bean plant. Chart
its growth for about two weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   This was much worse than I imagined. I scanned through the
possible projects. Grow a stalk of celery in food coloring for a
week. Observe the stages of a beetle's life. Ask your vet for
pamphlets on animal parasites. Do a vocabulary puzzle _ see your
teacher for the appropriate sheet. Do a project on traveling seeds
_ see your teacher for the appropriate sheet.
</P>
<P>
   We didn't have two weeks or even 24 hours. We didn't have any
appropriate sheets. And having recently moved and completely purged
our magazine collection in an anti-pack-rat fury, we didn't have
any pictures with which to make collages, which eliminated at least
two of the possibilities.
</P>
<P>
   There were, in fact, only four projects from each chapter that
we might possibly be able to complete in one night.
</P>
<P>
   While Brittany continued to gather information on the proper
names of baby lions, female ducks and male horses, I set 6-year-old
daughter Hadley to work making rubbings of the leaves that had been
collected. While Jack drew a flower, labeling its parts _ stamen,
sepal, pollen _ I ran out to the garage to find some plant food for
which Jack could list the ingredients. Then I gingerly picked my
way through Kelly's schoolroom and Barbie's ranch to open the
screened windows before I turned on the computer.
</P>
<P>
   I asked Jeeves, my favorite cyber source: Is a bean derived from
a fruit, leaf, stem or root?
</P>
<P>
   By 8:30, Brittany and I couldn't think of the name of the 19th
and 20th grown-ups whom Jack could theoretically have surveyed to
ask if they were vegetarians.
</P>
<P>
   By 8:45, we ran out of computer paper, and Brittany tried in
vain to print out her list of carnivores, herbivores and omnivores
on a sheet of three-ring binder, lined paper.
</P>
<P>
   By 9 p.m., Brittany left to have dinner and return to her own
life's challenges.
</P>
<P>
   By 9:30, Hadley was in bed, having practiced her 10 spelling
words twice.
</P>
<P>
   And by 11, Jack was finished. We had found pictures of him to
chart his growth in the bottom of an unpacked box of books. We had
found an illustration of a colorful chameleon for him to copy, and
two kinds of penguins for him to draw. He had mapped out the life
cycle of a frog. As the 14th and final project, we would bring his
pet turtle to school the next day and he would give a report on its
eating habits and its care and how its adaptations helped it
survive.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't great work. But it was done.
</P>
<P>
   At 11:30, I sat down at my computer, felt the cool breeze waft
in, and found to my surprise that I could not think of one thing
even mildly funny about the dawn of summer.
</P>
<P>
   The One and Only Reason to Be Glad It's Summer was all I could
envision: No more homework.
</P>
<P>
   Bring on the ice cream-truck worries and the lemonade-stand
work. And if an ant bites, so what. I'm sure Jeeves can tell me
what to do.
</P>
<P>
   And the best thing is that nobody will want to know what the
male and female and baby ant are called.

week. Observe the stages of a beetle's life. Ask your vet for
pamphlets on animal parasites. Do a vocabulary puzzle _ see your
teacher for the appropriate sheet. Do a project on traveling seeds
_ see your teacher for the appropriate sheet.
</P>
<P>
   We didn't have two weeks or even 24 hours. We didn't have any
appropriate sheets. And having recently moved and completely purged
our magazine collection in an anti-pack-rat fury, we didn't have
any pictures with which to make collages, which eliminated at least
two of the possibilities.
</P>
<P>
   There were, in fact, only four projects from each chapter that
we might possibly be able to complete in one night.
</P>
<P>
   While Brittany continued to gather information on the proper
names of baby lions, female ducks and male horses, I set 6-year-old
daughter Hadley to work making rubbings of the leaves that had been
collected. While Jack drew a flower, labeling its parts _ stamen,
sepal, pollen _ I ran out to the garage to find some plant food for
which Jack could list the ingredients. Then I gingerly picked my
way through Kelly's schoolroom and Barbie's ranch to open the
screened windows before I turned on the computer.
</P>
<P>
   I asked Jeeves, my favorite cyber source: Is a bean derived from
a fruit, leaf, stem or root?
</P>
<P>
   By 8:30, Brittany and I couldn't think of the name of the 19th
and 20th grown-ups whom Jack could theoretically have surveyed to
ask if they were vegetarians.
</P>
<P>
   By 8:45, we ran out of computer paper, and Brittany tried in
vain to print out her list of carnivores, herbivores and omnivores
on a sheet of three-ring binder, lined paper.
</P>
<P>
   By 9 p.m., Brittany left to have dinner and return to her own
life's challenges.
</P>
<P>
   By 9:30, Hadley was in bed, having practiced her 10 spelling
words twice.
</P>
<P>
   And by 11, Jack was finished. We had found pictures of him to
chart his growth in the bottom of an unpacked box of books. We had
found an illustration of a colorful chameleon for him to copy, and
two kinds of penguins for him to draw. He had mapped out the life
cycle of a frog. As the 14th and final project, we would bring his
pet turtle to school the next day and he would give a report on its
eating habits and its care and how its adaptations helped it
survive.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't great work. But it was done.
</P>
<P>
   At 11:30, I sat down at my computer, felt the cool breeze waft
in, and found to my surprise that I could not think of one thing
even mildly funny about the dawn of summer.
</P>
<P>
   The One and Only Reason to Be Glad It's Summer was all I could
envision: No more homework.
</P>
<P>
   Bring on the ice cream-truck worries and the lemonade-stand
work. And if an ant bites, so what. I'm sure Jeeves can tell me
what to do.
</P>
<P>
   And the best thing is that nobody will want to know what the
male and female and baby ant are called.

<P>
   ``The Balance of the NIV' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   By Kenneth Barker &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (Baker, $13.99) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Think of Kenneth Barker's ``The Balance of the NIV'' as
``Goldilocks and the Three-Plus Bible Translations'': Some versions
take too many interpretive liberties, some are too wooden and
literalistic, but at least one is just about right.
</P>
<P>
   ``What constitutes a good translation?'' Barker asks in the last
installment of a Baker Books trilogy on the New International
Version. His answer: balance in its translation committee approach,
textual basis, translation philosophy, handling of tough passages,
and support resources. ``The Balance of the NIV,'' then, is
essentially an explanation and defense of the NIV's approach to
those matters.
</P>
<P>
   Barker's book often deals with scholarly technicalities, so a
passing acquaintance with the principles of textual criticism is at
least handy. ``The Balance of the NIV'' will be most helpful to
those with a serious interest in matters of biblical translation. &QL;

</P>
<P>
   ``This Mystery'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Nichole Nordeman &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sparrow Records &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Nichole Nordeman treats her listeners to a bit of nostalgia by
including the old Stevie Wonder classic ``As'' on this album. The
song is given some updated, Christian lyrics, but the music and the
beat are true to the original.
</P>
<P>
   The song is a pleasure, but it's also a diversion.
</P>
<P>
   Nordeman's strength is not covering other people's work, but
creating her own.
</P>
<P>
   On ``Wide Eyed,'' her debut album, Nordeman gained a reputation
as a songwriter of considerable depth. That reputation is enhanced
here.
</P>
<P>
   She has a good voice, and her music has a nice piano-heavy pop
sound, but the thing that sets Nordeman apart from the crowd is the
thought-provoking message in the music.
</P>
<P>
   The theme of ``Wide Eyed'' was personal faith. On this one, it's
the mystery of God.
</P>
<P>
   The 10 songs _ Nordeman wrote eight and collaborated on two,
including the lyrics-tweaking on ``As'' _ consider the miracles and
majesty of God, the depth and breadth of God, the questions and
doubts about God, and ultimately challenge the listener to live for
God. &QL;

   Palm Storage Device Makes Room for Fun
</P>
<P>
   Road warriors who get that syncing feeling with their Palm
organizers can now safely back up their data, even when there is no
desktop in sight. JKS Technologie, a German company, has created
the FlashPlug, a small device that adds 8 megabytes of storage.
</P>
<P>
   Palm owners have traditionally backed up data by syncronizing
the unit with a desktop or laptop computer via a Palm cradle
attached to it. FlashPlug users can connect the gadget to the Palm
and back up files onto the unit with the device's file manager
software.
</P>
<P>
   The lightweight FlashPlug does not require extra batteries and
will run on the Palm operating system, version 2.04 or higher. It
connects easily to most models of the Palm organizer, although the
Palm V and Vx require an adapter. Storage space on the FlashPlug
can also be partitioned. More information can be found on the
FlashPlug Web site (www.flashplug.de). The FlashPlug costs about
$120 and can be purchased in the United States from the PDA Life
Web site (www.pdalife.com).
</P>
<P>
   The FlashPlug is also being promoted as a storage drive for
large Palm databases like files containing medical reference
materials. (Files have to be copied back to the Palm before they
can be used.) Better yet, the FlashPlug might make room for the
really fun stuff, like electronic texts, games, digital maps and
graphic images, which are handy to have but are voracious space
hogs when you have only a couple of megabytes of memory.

   Soccer Fans Can Follow Euro 2000 on the Web
</P>
<P>
   For most of the world outside the United States, soccer is not a
matter of life and death _ it is much more important than that.
</P>
<P>
   The rabid _ and sometimes violent _ devotion to the sport will
be on display in Belgium and the Netherlands beginning on June 10,
the opening date for the European Championships, or Euro 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Fans of the sport can follow the 16-nation tournament, which
begins in Brussels and ends with the championship match on July 2
in Rotterdam, the Netherlands, on the Euro 2000 Web site
(www.euro2000.org).
</P>
<P>
   The site offers voluminous information in five languages:
English, French, German, Spanish and Italian. There is information
on each nation's team, a history of the tournament since its
inception in 1960, video tours of the eight cities in which the
games will be held and a video library of every goal scored in the
competition since 1980.

and WAV files and is about the size and shape of a heavy portable
CD player, but it has a hefty six gigabytes of hard drive space.
That's more than 90 times that of most smaller MP3 players.
</P>
<P>
   That means the Jukebox can hold up to 100 hours of music in the
MP3 format, which is equal to the music on 150 music CD's.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the limitations in the MP3 player market has been lack
of storage space.'' said Hector Martinez, a company spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Those many audiophiles who do not believe the commonly heard
claim that MP3's produce ``near CD sound quality'' can use the
Nomad Jukebox to store less music but at higher speeds, up to 320
kilobits per second.
</P>
<P>
   The Jukebox can be plugged into a home computer through a U.S.B.
port and can be played through car stereo systems or used with
headphones.
</P>
<P>
   At a suggested retail price of $499, however, the cost matches a
hefty hard drive.
</P>
<P>
   Pump Up the Power In a Cell Phone Battery
</P>
<P>
   If the battery in your cell phone is about to die, get a grip.
That is the underlying message in a new charger called
Aladdinpower, a portable power generator that lets cell phone users
reinvigorate their batteries by squeezing a small, handheld pump.
</P>
<P>
   Diane Collins, advertising director for the Bridges Equipment
Co., an outdoor-power company in Brandon, Fla., that distributes
the chargers, said she pumps the grip while she is on and off her
cell phone and has found that the time it takes to recharge the
battery differs depending on how fast and hard she squeezes. Her
husband had a dead cell phone battery, she said, and it took him
about three minutes of steady pumping to recharge it halfway.
</P>
<P>
   Designed by Japanese engineers, Aladdinpower works by converting
each squeeze of the grip into electricity that replenishes the cell
phone battery. The brushed aluminum device weighs 11 ounces and is
5\ inches long.
</P>
<P>
   To work with the variety of cell phones on the market, it must
be used with a DC power adapter designed for your particular phone.
Cell phone users who charge their phones through their car's
cigarette lighter probably already have the adapter, Collins said.
</P>
<P>
   For now, the device is sold only through Magellan's, a travel
supply catalog (www.magellans.com), and through a branch of the
Bridges Equipment Web site (www.aladdinpower.com). Magellan's site
sells the power charger for $75, including a leather carrying case.
On the Bridges site, the charger can be purchased alone for $59.95.
On both sites, the power generator comes with a small flashlight
that can be squeezed into action in an emergency.

FOR THE ULTRA BUSY, ALL MESSAGES IN ONE BASKET 
</HEADLINE>
   By KAREN J. BANNAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Don Damico, vice president and general manager of an industrial
holding company in New York, visits three of his company's offices,
in New York City and Pennsylvania, during the week. Even though he
carries a cellular phone, it can be difficult to get in touch with
him. Sometimes he turns off his phone for meetings, and he finds it
hard to get cell phone coverage in some places.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always have salespeople trying to find me,'' Damico said.
``With all the travel I do, it's tough to get me in one place.''
</P>
<P>
   A friend suggested that he try Messagepoint, a service that
handles voice, e-mail and fax messages. He signed up with the
service for $19.95 per month and was instantly hooked.
</P>
<P>
   Messagepoint, like other unified messaging services, gives users
like Damico individual telephone numbers they can call to check
their messages _ all their messages. Since calls to Damico's other
telephone lines are forwarded to his Messagepoint number if he does
not answer them, he has to check only one number for voice mail.
All of his e-mail and faxes also go to the same Messagepoint
mailbox, and he can check them when he checks his voice mail.
</P>
<P>
   Although Damico cannot use the phone to find out what is in his
faxes, he is notified when faxes are waiting for him. He can then
log on to the Internet to view them at a Web site. E-mail is read
to him over the phone, and he can dictate e-mail replies. That
saves him hours every month, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If one of my guys has an important question for me,'' he said,
``they can send me an e-mail, and I can respond to it right away,
even if I don't have my laptop.''
</P>
<P>
   Unified messaging services have been available for more than six
years, said Megan Gurley, a research analyst at the Yankee Group, a
research firm based in Boston, but they did not catch on until
recently because there was not a real need for them. And consumers
did not understand what the services could do.
</P>
<P>
   But as more people try to keep up with home-based, office-based
and cellular phones, as well as with multiple e-mail addresses,
unified messaging may be on the verge of becoming a mass market
product. Demand for the service has also been fueled by
technological improvements in voice recognition systems.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Messagepoint, companies like General Magic,
Onebox.com, Ptek Systems and Webley Systems offer unified
messaging, and each has its own take on the service. Some let users
dial a local number to retrieve messages, while some offer the
option, for an additional fee, of a toll-free number. Some
services, like Onebox.com, are free; Onebox.com plans to make money
by licensing its technology to telephone companies and cellular
carriers. Others, like the Portico service from General Magic, cost
$9.95 per month or more and offer news and stock quotations over
the phone in addition to message services.
</P>
<P>
   Once unified messaging services catch on, free services may
become hard to find. For example, Telebot.com, a free service of
Portelco, based in Hayward, Calif., recently closed. Nader
Rahimizad, the company's chairman and chief executive officer, said
Telebot.com would reopen soon as a service designed for cellular
carriers.
</P>
<P>
   All the services let users listen over the phone to their
e-mail; the text is ``spoken'' by text-to-speech software. If a
user wants to reply to an e-mail note, that person can dictate a
response; the service will send an e-mail reply that contains an
audio file attachment with the dictated message. Anyone who gets
one of these replies can listen to the message by double-clicking
on the attachment. Since most PCs today come with the Windows Media
Player, which handles WAV files, recipients do not need any
additional software to play the messages.
</P>
<P>
   Message services let people like Damico roam without a laptop
computer and still remain connected to the office.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was traveling once, and there was a decision that had to be
made on whether we could meet a certain quote for a very large
piece of business,'' Damico said. ``The client e-mailed me. I was
able to get his message and listen to it, which I wouldn't have
until later that night. I was able to work out a deal with him, and
I never saw the e-mail.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Some services, like Webley from Webley Systems, Orchestrate from
Ptek and Portico, have a ``find me, follow me'' feature that
bounces an incoming call from one of the user's phone numbers to
the next until the user is located. Even if the user is found in
this way, the user can still choose to screen the calls and send to
voice mail.
</P>
<P>
   If a user listens to an e-mail or a voice mail message and wants
to respond, there are several services that can handle outbound
calls. Webley, for example, lets users dial by name or number and
connects the calls at a flat rate of 14.9 cents per minute
(expected to drop soon to less than 10 cents). Depending on the
service, the fee for outbound calls is in addition to what users
pay for calling the messaging center.
</P>
<P>
   Unified messaging can eliminate the need for a fax machine.
Senders can dial a phone number provided by the service to send a
fax to one of the service's customers. That fax is then stored as
an image file on the Web. Customers can use their computers to view
and print their faxes directly from the Web site. That feature
proved valuable to Jan Weiss, a vice president at a large
commercial bank in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Weiss was in Washington on business when she ran into a small
problem. She was waiting for a fax from her office, but the
business center in the hotel she was staying in had already closed.
Using Onebox.com's service, she was able to receive her fax when
she needed it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The documents I needed were for a conference call,'' Weiss
said. ``A client wanted an answer on something. I wouldn't have
been able to give them the answer if I didn't get that fax.''
</P>
<P>
   To sign up for a messaging service, users usually fill out an
online form and choose a toll-free telephone number. Generally, the
telephone numbers are available for use within minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The process will become even simpler in the next six to 18
months as local telephone companies and cellular carriers start
offering versions of unified messaging, Gurley said. Instead of
having customers go through the sign-up process manually, the
carriers will do all of the setup. Pacific Bell already offers its
customers the Wildfire service from Wildfire Communications, while
Bell Atlantic is also working on a unified messaging system.
</P>
<P>
   Even with the many benefits, there are several problems with
unified messaging services. For one thing, a user generally cannot
transfer a home or office number to a message service, so dialing
the service means another number to remember. Only customers who
sign up for a messaging service through a telephone or cellular
carrier can make their regular phone numbers their message numbers
(although many services let users have calls forwarded from their
regular numbers to their message services). And users may have to
give out one more number to business associates if they want things
sent via fax to services when they are out of their offices.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, none of the companies offer local telephone numbers
for customers to use to call the message center directly in all
areas of the country. So unless users are willing to take on the
added expense of having services provide them with toll-free
numbers, they may end up incurring long-distance charges.
</P>
<P>
   Users say the extra trouble is worth the result: simplified
communications.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is definitely bringing things together for me,'' said Meg
Luttrell, a Onebox customer in Palo Alto, Calif. ``Right now we're
transitioning offices, and I'm moving in my personal life. Having
one number to check is a godsend.''

INTERNET OFFERS ALL THE WEATHER YOU'LL EVER NEED 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: optional sidebar at end of article)  
 By BONNIE ROTHMAN MORRIS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Carey Hoffman describes himself as a weather nut.
</P>
<P>
   Twice in the last three years, Hoffman, a public information
officer at the University of Cincinnati, has taken off from work to
attend a severe-weather symposium at Ohio State University ``for
fun and entertainment,'' he wrote in an e-mail note. Since he was 9
years old and a tornado touched down one block from his house in
the suburbs of Cincinnati, Hoffman has been in hot pursuit of
information about the weather.
</P>
<P>
   ``The day we got cable TV was a great day,'' said Hoffman, who
saw his first radar screen displaying weather information on a
local cable channel. The debut of the Weather Channel in 1982 was
another bright day for Hoffman.
</P>
<P>
   But it is the Internet that has made Hoffman and others like him
feel as if they are in weather paradise. Using several elaborate
sites, a weather fanatic can keep tabs on the temperature, the
barometric pressure, the wind speed, even the movement of storm
clouds.
</P>
<P>
   Hoffman now pursues his hobby by checking a half dozen sites on
a stormy day. He particularly enjoys exploring the Web site of the
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (www.noaa.gov).
</P>
<P>
   NOAA, part of the Commerce Department, is the parent agency of
the National Weather Service, and its site is a favorite among
meteorologists and weather fanatics.
</P>
<P>
   On the site, Hoffman said, he finds forecasters discussing
severe storms with one another. ``It's somewhat scientific, but
they talk more openly than what they're going to tell the public,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Hoffman's obsession does not surprise those who provide weather
information. Weather, they said, is simply fascinating. ``It's a
24-hour story,'' said Joel N. Myers, president and founder of
AccuWeather, a forecasting service.
</P>
<P>
   ``The U.S. is a country that gets more different kinds of
weather than any other country in the world,'' said Dr. D. James
Baker, who is administrator of NOAA and undersecretary for oceans
and atmosphere at the Department of Commerce, who is responsible
for the National Weather Service.
</P>
<P>
   Decker Anstrom, chief executive of the Weather Channel, said,
``The unpredictability of weather and forecasts' being wrong is
what keeps people interested in the weather.''
</P>
<P>
   Organizations ranging from the National Weather Service to
private forecasting companies and television stations are trying to
muscle in on the Weather Channel and grab the attention of weather
enthusiasts with their Web sites. The advantage of the Internet,
the organizations said, is instantaneous, updated, personalized
weather information.
</P>
<P>
   The sites, including AccuWeather, (www.accuweather.com), Weather
Services International (www.intellicast.com) and Automated Weather
Source (www.aws/instaweather.asp), are providing more detailed,
more colorful and more graphic information. Not to be outdone, the
Weather Channel also has an elaborate site, www.weather.com.
</P>
<P>
   These sites are useful to people whose interest in the weather
starts and stops with wanting to know if they need an umbrella that
day. But for weather fanatics, the sites are the mother lode. They
show real-time satellite weather photos, current temperatures for
cities around the world, wind speeds on the ocean, tornado watches
on the plains.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike television broadcasts _ even the Weather Channel _ and
radio reports where you have to wait for a forecast, the Web sites
offer continually updated information.
</P>
<P>
   Many sites offer what has been referred to as now-casting or
personal weather views. At intellicast.com, for example, weather
reports are intended for hobbyists with weather-related interests,
like sailors, golfers and amateur astronomers.
</P>
<P>
   While National Weather Service forecasts (which can be found on
these sites as well) depict what the weather is at the airport, the
commercial sites can take microviews, zeroing in on a particular
town or a street. The sites are designed to allow users to get
information quickly; travelers, for instance, can easily find the
10-day forecast for their destination.
</P>
<P>
   One such service is AWS's WeatherBug (www.weatherbug/aws), a
free service that PC users can download onto their computers. When
severe weather has been forecast, a weather icon alerts the user.
The service is about a month old and has about 31,000 subscribers.
The average user has been clicking in 13 times a day, said
Stephanie M. Blozy, a meteorologist at AWS, formally known as
Automated Weather Source. Users of Web-enabled cell phones and
organizers like the Palm VII can download the free AWS WeatherNet
software for access to weather information on the go. A particular
favorite with weather hobbyists is weather.gov, the National
Weather Service page that says 10,000 weather sites link to it.
Here, users can scan for warnings of severe weather around the
world and check the latest satellite pictures and even 3-D images
of potential hurricanes. The site is extensive. As Hoffman found,
the deeper into the site you go, the more technical the information
becomes.
</P>
<P>
   To prepare forecasts, the National Weather Service and the
Federal Aviation Administration collect data from weather stations
at most airports and other sites once every hour. Weather
instruments _ everything from thermometers and barometers to
satellites, weather ballons and Doppler radar _ are used to gather
information. Doppler radar detects the location and intensity of
rain, snow and other forms of precipitation.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Meteorologists at the National Weather Service and some
independent weather companies, like AccuWeather and the Weather
Channel, run the weather service information through computer
models that generate forecasts. Meteorologists then interpret the
data. The information is packaged and sent to media organizations
and is also put on Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   Local meteorologists often gather additional information to
compile forecasts. The data is culled from instruments, including
Doppler radar owned by the broadcast stations, and from local
weather stations, including one or more of roughly 4,000 schools
set up with instruments through a program sponsored by AWS through
its School WeatherNet program.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the vast amount of information, weather forecasting is
still inexact.
</P>
<P>
   ``The average user doesn't understand the degree of uncertainty
behind this,'' said Dr. Mark S. Monmonier, professor of geography
at Syracuse University and author of ``Air Apparent: How
Meteorologists Learned to Map, Predict and Dramatize Weather''
(University of Chicago Press, 1999).
</P>
<P>
   Monmonier likened weather forecasting to a horse race where one
forecaster places all bets on one horse (one weather prediction
model) while other forecasters use different models.
</P>
<P>
   Linda Church, a longtime television meteorologist in New York,
said, ``Models of the atmosphere include wind speed, humidity, and
temperature of the atmosphere at different heights.'' One model
might indicate rain in the morning, Church said, while another
might predict rain later in the day. Accuweather.com is testing a
streaming feature called ``point-counterpoint,'' in which
meteorologists debate forecasts.
</P>
<P>
   When the forecasts are wrong, some people get angry, Monmonier
said. ``The difficulty stems from the tendency of the general
public to think that because we are spending hundreds of millions
of dollars on high tech that it will remove uncertainty,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Mel Goldstein, a meteorologist, said, ``Accuracy is around
85 percent today, and it was 85 percent accurate 85 years ago.''
Goldstein is a former professor of meteorology at Western
Connecticut State University, a meteorologist at WTNH television in
New Haven and the author of ``The Complete Idiot's Guide to
Weather'' (Alpha Books, 1999).
</P>
<P>
   ``We're talking about a 24-hour forecast,'' Goldstein said.
``Most of the time it's easy to predict the weather _ you look out
the window. But during rapidly developing weather situations the
forecast accuracy falls far below that 85 percent, and
unfortunately, those are the occasions when most people are
watching.''
</P>
<P>
   Some elements of forecasts, however, have become more accurate.
A five-day forecast today is as accurate as a three-day forecast 10
or 15 years ago, said Jim Candor, a vice president of AccuWeather.
And these forecasts are far more detailed, far beyond the old
``clear and sunny tomorrow, temps in the high 60s.''
</P>
<P>
   Baker of NOAA said even more accuracy and detail are in the
offing. ``Better and more accurate data and higher speed and better
computers to take in all the data and tell us where weather will
happen'' will result in better forecasts, he said.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, weather enthusiasts will have to choose from
the information that is already available, unless, of course, they
prefer to make their own forecasts, like Roger Perry. Perry, an
eighth grade science teacher at the Plymouth Community Intermediate
School in Plymouth, Mass., has a weather station at the school.
</P>
<P>
   Along with the standard instruments, Perry has two receivers for
NOAA weather satellite information, a live weather radar feed, five
weather stations with logs for data, lightning detection antennas
and all-day connections to the Internet. And a television in
Perry's weather station is tuned in to the Weather Channel.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a live weather radar image running in real time,''
Perry said. With all of this kind of data, he added, ``anybody can
make a forecast.''
</P>
<P>
   Perry and his students extend their weather activities beyond
the classroom. They serve as spotters for the weather service, a
loosely knit group of enthusiasts who watch for severe weather and
report their observations. They also offer weather information to
local cranberry growers and the nuclear power plant in town.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his interest and his equipment, Perry said he would
still like more information. To him, there can never be enough
weather information. That, he says, makes him a true weather nut.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   EQUIPMENT FOR AMATEUR FORECASTERS
</P>
<P>
   According to Roger Perry, a science teacher at the Plymouth
Community Intermediate School in Plymouth, Mass., weather
forecasting is simple, once you have set yourself up with the right
equipment and access to information.
</P>
<P>
   Perry said that ``a good Internet connection and a list of
weather information Internet sites,'' starting with weather.gov, a
National Weather Service site, can point an amateur forecaster in
the right direction.
</P>
<P>
   The following equipment is also helpful:
</P>
<P>
   _ An outdoor thermometer that will record the minimum and
maximum temperatures for the day.
</P>
<P>
   _ Wind speed and direction instruments.
</P>
<P>
   _ A barometer to measure air pressure.
</P>
<P>
   _ A 4-inch plastic rain gauge.
</P>
<P>
   _ A yardstick or meter stick to measure snowfall.
</P>
<P>
   _ A shelter to protect the instruments from heating up on sunny
days.
</P>
<P>
   _ A weather log chart.
</P>
<P>
   _ A National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration weather
radio, which can receive high-frequency weather broadcasts.
</P>
<P>
   Thermometers and rain gauges can be found for as little as a
dollar, but Perry suggested using sturdier equipment. These can be
found on the Web at sites of companies that sell weather
instruments, including Maximum Inc. (www.maximum-inc.com); the
Weather Store (www.wxstore.com), a folksy site offering
weathervanes and weather stations; and Davis Instruments
(www.davisnet.com), which sells home weather stations, some of
which can be linked to a personal computer. Lightning detectors are
for sale at Stormwise (www.stormwise.com), a site specializing in
these instruments.
</P>
<P>
   For the true weather fanatic, individual weather satellite
receivers and other weather information systems can be purchased
through Zephyrus Electronics (www.big-z.com), DTN Kavouras Weather
Services (www.dtn.com/weather) and Alden ELectronics
(www.alden.com), among others. These sites cater mostly to
industrial and commercial users but will sell to individuals.

 &HT;    Gelatin's jiggly appeal suspended in place and time
 &HT;    By Rachel Sauer
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GRAND JUNCTION, Colo. _
</P>
<P>
   Quiz:
</P>
<P>
   1. You're sick with what feels like alien torture flu. Your mom
(or spouse, or roommate) brings you:
</P>
<P>
   a. a doctor to surgically remove your throat because otherwise
it's just going to use those teeth and claws to crawl into your
head and eat your brain.
</P>
<P>
   b. down, man. You know you're sick, but it doesn't help to be
told to stop coughing.
</P>
<P>
   c. Jell-O.
</P>
<P>
   2. You're at the church potluck picnic. It's 100 percent
guaranteed that someone will bring:
</P>
<P>
   a. Uncle Ed who wears the head umbrella.
</P>
<P>
   b. a guitar and play the same three chords in different song
variations until you want to bash the instrument on something, like
John Belushi did in ``Animal House'': Learn a new song!
</P>
<P>
   c. Jell-O.
</P>
<P>
   3. You're giving a public speech and your legs feel like:
</P>
<P>
   OK, enough with the quiz. Your legs feel like Jell-O, and you
know it. Everyone else knows it, too.
</P>
<P>
   The point is this: Jell-O gelatin has 99 percent name
recognition in the United States and is found in 72 percent of
homes, according to Kraft Foods Inc. About the only other thing to
rival Jell-O in universality is TV.
</P>
<P>
   Jell-O _ and we're talking gelatin, not pudding or no-bake
desserts or whatever _ is everywhere. It's a cultural reference
point for a society that increasingly celebrates what is different
about us rather than what is the same.
</P>
<P>
   But Jell-O is the same. It's something we share, a jiggly
commonality, if you will, of similar experience. Oh, there have
been other gelatins _ Knox and Knorr and a few other forgettables _
but it's the big red letters that do something for us. Jell-O. It's
weird and mysterious, a renaissance food that you love or hate, sip
or slurp, wiggle or jiggle, or... just gimme the Jell-O.
</P>
<P>
   A SEMI-BRIEF HISTORY
</P>
<P>
   History shows that cooks through the ages have used gelatin, or
jelly, for stuff. We don't know why, and it seems like a lot of
work to look up, but trust us: There was gelatin being used.
However, it was usually made by boiling animal parts (gelatin being
nothing more than processed collagen found in the connective
tissues of animal parts, so there's a grain of truth to what you
heard in your elementary school cafeteria about Jell-O being made
from horses' hooves) (but it was later discovered there's other
stuff that gels), which was a hassle.
</P>
<P>
   In 1845, Peter Cooper _ builder of the Tom Thumb locomotive,
founder of Cooper Union, former presidential candidate, glue
factory owner _ registered a patent for ``an improvement in the
preparation of portable gelatin. He said it ``consists in making a
transparent concentrated or solidified jelly containing all the
ingredients fitting it for table use, in a portable form and
requiring only the addition of a prescribed quantity of hot water
to dissolve it, when it may be poured into glasses or molds and
when cold will be fit for use.''
</P>
<P>
   It didn't take off. Cooks still used sheets of prepared gelatin,
which had to be clarified by boiling them with egg whites and
shells and poured through a jelly bag before they could be turned
into molds.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of boxed, easy-to-prepare gelatin languished for 52
years until Pearle B. Wait, a carpenter and cough medicine
manufacturer from LeRoy, N.Y., wanted to enter the packaged food
business. He came up with a fruit-flavored version of Cooper's
gelatin and his wife, May, named it Jell-O. It was available in
strawberry, raspberry, orange and lemon, and for two years Wait
tried selling it door-to-door. It didn't take off.
</P>
<P>
   Frustrated, Wait sold the Jell-O business for $450 to his
neighbor, Orator Francis Woodward, founder of the Genesee Pure Food
Company. The first year's sales were abysmal and Woodward tried
selling Jell-O to his plant superintendent for $35, but the offer
was refused. Woodward then looked for creative sales techniques,
including sending out a well-groomed sales force to parties, fairs,
socials and picnics, offering to supply each event with free Jell-O
gelatin.
</P>
<P>
   And that's when Jell-O took off. By 1906 sales had soared to
just under the $1 million level. By printing cookbooks encouraging
the use of molds to make fancy Jell-O salads, Woodward launched a
Jell-O juggernaut. Famous artists _ including Rosie O'Neill,
Maxfield Parrish, Norman Rockwell and Linn Ball _ were commissioned
to make art for Jell-O ads. Recipe booklets reflected the times _
the decadence of the '20s, the economy of the '30s, the patriotism
of the '40s and the renewed American spirit of the '50s. Jack Benny
and Kate Smith became Jell-O spokespeople. Bing and Dixie Lee
Crosby duetted on a song called ``A Fine Romance'' with the line,
``You take romance, I'll take Jell-O.''
</P>
<P>
   Jell-O represented a miracle of marketing: Jell-O molds and
posters and crates and creamers and figurines and dolls and aprons
and cookbooks and magnets and just about whatever you can think of.
Flavors came and went _ concord grape, apple and, in Canada, bubble
gum and root beer. The Jell-O rocket took off and still is in
orbit.
</P>
<P>
   These days, and now owned by Kraft Foods, Inc., Jell-O sales
average 854,795 packages per day purchased in the United States.
There's a Jell-O museum in LeRoy, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   All this for what essentially is a see-through food.
</P>
<P>
   A JELL-O HAIKU:
</P>
<P>
   Eighty-nine cent box
</P>
<P>
   Of jiggly, wiggly weird food _
</P>
<P>
   What's with the carrots?
</P>
<P>
   Seriously, what is with those carrot flecks floating there in
green Jell-O with something entirely unrelated, like pineapple or
marshmallows? Floating there like they're cryogenically frozen and
waiting to wake up when the world's a better place or man is living
on Mars. You can be sure there will be Jell-O on Mars.
</P>
<P>
   But back to the point: Since it was invented, people have been
inspired to put stuff in Jell-O and call it salad, or mold, or
surprise, or mousse, or delight or whatever. It's all code for
Jell-O with stuff in it, possibly shaped like a Bundt cake.
</P>
<P>
   The question is, why? Camille Rustige, public relations
representative for Hunter &AMP; Associates Inc., which does public
relations for Jell-O, wasn't sure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hmmm,'' she said. ``Good question.''
</P>
<P>
   We'll just say the big ``Why did people start putting stuff in
Jell-O'' question is like Jell-O itself: a mystery. And then we'll
just go with it and say it happens. Stuff gets put in Jell-O and
taken to a potluck.
</P>
<P>
   For something interesting to do, borrow the ``Joys of Jell-O''
cookbook, printed in the late 1960s, from your mom (she calls it
``Diary of a Mad Housewife''). Thumb through the pages and pages _
87 in all! _ of molded, shaped and otherwise coiffed Jell-O
concoctions. Avocado Strawberry Ring! Citrus Surprise! Chicken
Mousse! We probably don't need to point out that not all Jell-O
creations are good.
</P>
<P>
   Kirsten Maakestad of Grand Junction has vivid memories of tomato
aspic (recipe: 1 16-ounce can stewed tomatoes, 1 small package
lemon, strawberry or mixed fruit gelatin, 1/2 teaspoon salt and 1
tablespoon vinegar or lemon juice, prepared and poured back in the
tomato can to mold) at Thanksgiving dinner.
</P>
<P>
   ``And it was served with a dollop of mayonnaise on top,'' she
said. ``At first I thought it was Cool Whip _ it didn't occur to me
at the time how gross Cool Whip with tomatoes would be. So maybe it
would be OK, but it was mayonnaise. For two nights I had to sit at
the table until I ate it, but finally my mom said I just had to eat
a bite.''
</P>
<P>
   Ask just about anyone and they have a Jell-O memory. Marilyn
Felling described herself as a child of the '50s who grew up with
Jell-O. It was just something she and the rest of her generation
ate for dessert, fancy Jell-O molds prepared by Mom.
</P>
<P>
   About 10 years ago she started collecting anything Jell-O,
because she's a collector and because she just loves Jell-O, and
now her collection fills a room in her house and boxes in her
garage. She has Jell-O dresses and original advertising prints and
molds and figurines and just about everything else, plus hundreds
and hundreds of boxes. The license plates on her Jell-O-red car say
``JELL-O.''
</P>
<P>
   She smiled and laughed. ``There's just something about Jell-O,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mom always made the green Jell-O with Cool Whip and
pineapple,'' said Raphael Allred of Grand Junction. ``It's a picnic
salad, a happy salad. And when we were sick she'd give us liquid
Jell-O. She was so young, but she always knew what to do. She had a
soothing voice and her hands were always so soft. She'd rub my face
and feed me spoonfuls of liquid strawberry Jell-O when I was
sick.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And what about those Jell-O eggs?'' added her sister, Tara
Allred of Salt Lake City. She said at Easter time the family made
Jell-O in egg molds and then their dad, Vance, would slurp them and
sing, ``Have you ever slurped Jell-O?'' to the tune of Olivia
Newton-John's ``Have You Never Been Mellow.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We would have Jell-O and my mom would make it really fancy,''
said Kerry Glynn of Grand Junction. ``She would put it in wine cups
with a dollop of Cool Whip.''
</P>
<P>
   Glynn and Maakestad both rhapsodized about Jell-O poke cake. Oh,
those Jell-O memories.
</P>
<P>
   WHICH OF THESE HAVE YOU SAID?:
</P>
<P>
   _ I feel a little green Jell-O today (get thee to a hospital!).
</P>
<P>
   _ Eew. My abs are like Jell-O. I gotta do some crunches.
</P>
<P>
   _ It was a red Jell-O event (church potluck, kids running around
crazy, questionable potato salad).
</P>
<P>
   _ Watch it wiggle, see it jiggle, cool and fruity Jell-O brand
gelatin. Of all desserts you'll love this one, it tastes so light,
it makes such fun. It's Jell-O brand gelatin _ make some fun.
J-E-L-L-O! (Quick, where are your car keys? You can't remember, can
you? But you remember this jingle.)
</P>
<P>
   _ Glasidfasnfak nviasdnkga (Jell-O shots: a bad idea).
</P>
<P>
   The thing is, people know Jell-O. We've all been to dinners
where Jell-O salads with marshmallows and nuts were served. We've
all had mixed success making Jell-O. We joke about it. We see it in
movies. And with picnic season beginning this weekend, we can't
help but think about Jell-O.
</P>
<P>
   It enjoys periodic resurgences _ the 100th anniversary three
years ago brought renewed interest, plus the wonderful sparkling
Jell-O you make with ginger ale. Twentysomething hipsters who love
all things retro-ironic host '50s style dinner parties with Jell-O
salads. There are Web sites dedicated to all things Jell-O and
physicists who analyze the chemical composition of the fun food.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone seems to have a favorite _ or at least notable _ Jell-O
salad: the lime Jell-O with cottage cheese, the one with cherries
and cream cheese cubes, the cherry Coke one, the one with the
pretzel crust and cream cheese layer, the cranberry-and-nuts
Thanksgiving Jell-O salad.
</P>
<P>
   Jigglers have replaced molded salads, and Jell-O has adjusted
with the times to add easy-to-make salads and sugar-free products
to their repertoire. Jell-O has become a food for the family on the
go, the health-conscious, the nostalgic and the faithful who always
have made Jell-O and will keep making Jell-O oblivious to the
fickle winds of food trends.
</P>
<P>
   Bring on the marshmallows and carrot bits.

`THE ANGEL ON THE ROOF': THE GRIT OF DAILY LIFE MEETS SPIRITUAL
EPIPHANY 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Publication notes at end of review) 
 By JANET MASLIN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``You! You're not mad at me like that, are you?'' asks a
character in Russell Banks' story ``Firewood.'' ``For leaving your
mother and all?'' Only a few pages later, in the next of the 31
stories in this beautifully lucid, frequently wrenching collection,
another father is asking his disaffected child essentially the same
thing. ``Was I wrong, to divorce your mother? To leave you?'' a man
asks in ``Quality Time,'' only to be spurned by an adult daughter
not interested in giving him a second chance. ``Now you've lost us
both,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   At his shattering best _ that is, in stories less easily
schematic than ``Quality Time'' turns out to be _ Banks offers
answers that are tough, honest and inevitable without being simple.
He returns again and again to the caldron of domestic life, in
which hard drinking, deep-seated strife and often the prospect of a
bleak New Hampshire winter make the walls close in. ``In those
days, women and me not finding out about them are what connected
everything in that man's life,'' one woman tells her son about his
father in ``Assisted Living.'' In ``Success Story,'' the narrator
observes that ``in some ways, my family was a civic reclamation
project _ the bright and pretty children and pathetic wife of a
brute who, nearly a decade ago, had disappeared into the northern
woods with a woman from the post office, never to be heard from
again.''
</P>
<P>
   In ``Firewood,'' Banks describes a man who has had his third
drink of the day by 8 a.m. as part of a familiar pattern (``and
before he knows how it happens, it has happened again, and there he
is, being pulled off some guy and hustled out the door or picked up
off the floor and aimed by strangers toward his car'') and winds up
alone in the snow, finding it easier to stack wood than to make
sense of his life. In ``Plains of Abraham,'' as in many of the
stories here, a character registers real regret about the wreckage
in his past. ``Family life had slipped from his grasp without his
having noticed, as if, closing his eyes to drink from a spring,
he'd lost a handful of clear water and was unable afterwards to
imagine a way to regain it. The spring must have dried up. A man
can't blame his hands, can he?''
</P>
<P>
   As this book reveals, with stories dating back to his 1975
``Searching for Survivors'' and nine previously uncollected stores
from Esquire, Ploughshares and other sources, the contrasts here
between quotidian reality and spiritual epiphany have been as
central to Banks' short fiction as they have to his novels. Anyone
who first became familiar with his work through the transcendent
film adaptations of ``The Sweet Hereafter'' and especially
``Affliction,'' which is closer in eloquent, unflinching tone to
the author's writing, will find nearly as much to discover here as
in the best of his longer fiction (those novels and the magnificent
``Continental Drift'').
</P>
<P>
   What elevates these stories far above their tacitly
heartbreaking events are the vast reserves of compassion and wisdom
that Banks brings to framing tragedy. One of the most eloquent
stories in the book is ``The Child Screams and Looks Back at You,''
in which a woman witnesses the death of her son.
</P>
<P>
   But ``The Angel on the Roof'' so knowingly and movingly explores
this kind of intimacy that its efforts to reveal a larger range
cast an unflattering light on some of its more marginal material.
Although this book collects work from four previously published
short story collections, almost all of the best entries come from
the 1981 ``Trailerpark,'' which features interwoven accounts of the
Granite State Trailerpark and its community of residents. Shuffling
the order of these pieces (so that ``The Fisherman'' is the first
to appear here, though it provided an ending to ``Trailerpark'' and
is best read after all its characters are already familiar) is
perhaps meant to show them off in a new perspective. But they still
stand out starkly amid more awkward conceits, like the stories
``The Caul'' and ``Indisposed,'' narrated respectively by Edgar
Allan Poe and Jane Hogarth, wife of the renowned portrait painter.
Within these stories are the seeds of ``Cloudsplitter,'' the
voluminous historical novel in which Banks reconstructed John
Brown's raid on Harper's Ferry. But far more successful and less
manipulative are the more direct, down-to-earth accounts of
ordinary lives as glimpsed by an extraordinarily wise observer.
</P>
<P>
   As a book that is not to be missed but is best read selectively,
``The Angel on the Roof'' is especially impressive for stories like
``The Guinea Pig Lady,'' a trailer park novella that builds to a
harrowing finale for its eccentric heroine, and ``Queen for a
Day,'' a stunning account of how a young boy tries helping his
mother to redefine their family. ``Lobster Night,'' previously
uncollected, begins its first paragraph this way: ``Stacy didn't
mean to tell Noonan that when she was 17 she was struck by
lightning.'' And its second paragraph starts this way: ``The night
Stacy told Noonan about the lightning was also the night she shot
and killed him.'' Among Banks' extraordinary skills, the technical
prowess and storytelling grace that hook a reader so seemingly
easily should not be overlooked.
</P>
<P>
   The story that best encapsulates Banks' cyclical sense of
domestic strife is ``The Visit,'' in which a man returns to the
scene and the memories of his father's bullying. ``It's as if
violence were a gift worth any price. Beyond the light and the
heat, it's a gift that engenders gorgeous dreams of retribution,
and they last for tens of generations of fathers and children,
husbands and wives _ it's a gift that shapes and drives fantasies
of becoming huge as a glacier and hard as iron, fast as light, and
sudden, like a volcano.'' Or of being able to articulate and
confront it as mightily as this.

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A front separating chilly air near the Canadian border from
summery warmth over most of the Plains and Eastern states will be
the focus for clusters of thunderstorms Thursday and Thursday
night. The heaviest thunderstorms will occur over the northern
Mississippi Valley and western Great Lakes where a plume of humid
air from the south is forced to rise over the cool air farther
north. Some storms will have damaging winds and hail. A few of the
thunderstorm clusters will pass over ground saturated by recent
rain, posing the threat of local flooding.
</P>
<P>
   A surge of very warm air will spread across the Ohio Valley into
the Middle Atlantic states. Variable clouds and a few thunderstorms
will occur near a front as it stalls later Thursday in the interior
Northeast. The Southeast will stay mainly sunny and hot with little
chance for rain.
</P>
<P>
   Cool, unsettled weather will linger over the northern Rockies,
especially in Montana. Most of the Southwest will be hot with ample
sunshine.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   FOCUS: FIRE AND THUNDER
</P>
<P>
   Isolated thunderstorms are expected Thursday in parts of New
Mexico where wildfires are burning thousands of acres of forest.
But the air near the ground is also relatively dry, raising the
likelihood that raindrops falling from the some of the storms will
evaporate before reaching the ground. Without wet trees and brush,
lightning strikes could ignite new wildfires. Gusty thunderstorm
winds may also cause erratic behavior of existing fires. &QL;

STRAT-O-MATIC IS BASEBALL BY THE NUMBERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (Circuits)  
 By PETER OLAFSON    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The manager in ``Bull Durham'' who declared ``baseball is a
simple game'' never had to keep the books. Strat-O-Matic CD-ROM
Baseball offers a fascinating window into the information-rich
world of the baseball manager and the subtle, but enduring,
satisfactions of statistics.
</P>
<P>
   Strat-O-Matic Baseball is based on the classic Strat-O-Matic
game played with cards and dice. Using data from past baseball
seasons (this version has the 1999 statistics, but statistics from
each of the last 100 baseball seasons are available), you draft
players and give them positions in the lineup or starting rotation.
You cannot simply draft an All-Star team, because you are competing
against other, computer-generated managers.
</P>
<P>
   You assign as many as 16 tendencies per player. Give that
inconsistent starter the quick hook. Bump up the hit-and-run
attempts for your most reliable hitter. And then they're off. The
games are played out either automatically, at a daunting speed, or
play-by-play, with the player making decisions like stealing a
base, adjusting the outfield or delivering an intentional walk
before each at-bat. The results, reported in charmingly detailed
text, reflect both the players' historical statistics and the
tendencies they receive from their Strat-O-Matic managers.
</P>
<P>
   Visually, the games don't compete with slicker products like
Triple Play 2001 by Electronic Arts or Microsoft Baseball 2001. The
players' names are superimposed on generic-looking players against
a black-and-white stadium background. The only on-screen action is
the animated path of the ball.
</P>
<P>
   But the game resonates with echoes of real baseball. You are not
simply following the dead hand of history: merely replicating the
statistics of real-life players would not be much fun, after all,
and changes in the variables can have a significant impact on how a
player performs. Adjusting the variables of any player's statistics
can drastically alter his season. For instance, could a Mark
McGwire or a Sammy Sosa hit 80 homers playing half his games in the
thin air of Denver? Would Kenny Lofton be able to steal against a
team stacked with power pitchers? Could Pedro Martinez or Randy
Johnson break the single-season record for strikeouts if his
manager gave him less rest or left him in games longer?
</P>
<P>
   Even a straight historical replay of the 1999 season found the
World Series champion Yankees edged out for the division title by
third-place Toronto and losing the wild card slot in a tiebreaker
with Boston.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, Strat-O-Matic's opening screen looks like the first
page of a database (not surprising, since organizing data is a
significant part of the game) and the game itself is spartan. Color
stadium backgrounds cost another $28. The game does include an
option for a batter-pitcher confrontation in which the player does
not actually swing the bat or pitch the ball. Rather, you have to
time a well-positioned mouse click on an on-screen bull's-eye.
</P>
<P>
   But Strat-O-Matic has a breadth and depth I have not experienced
in other baseball games. The team is distinctly my team, the
results are distinctly my results, and the level of control of that
team and the displays of those results are nothing less than
mind-boggling.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent season, my Boston-based team was anchored on the
sluggers Luis Gonzalez and Mike Sweeney, and included Billy Wagner
as my closer. How did we fare in extra-inning games in May? How did
Wagner perform against left-handed hitters at night? Strat-O-Matic
knows. Double-click on a player's name on the main screen to summon
a table that contains his performance in every simulated game. A
Strat-O-Matic team has lots of room for its owner's fingerprints,
and lots of feedback to indicate whether they are on the right
buttons.
</P>
<P>
   The uninitiated may see the results simply as columns of
numbers, ranging from sports-section standards like batting and
earned-run average to obscurities like isolated power. They would
be right, but after a 162-game season of tweaks, experiments,
promotions and demotions, I cannot bring myself to feel cool and
calculating. I feel like the people who line up at Strat-O-Matic's
headquarters in Glen Head, N.Y., every year to collect the new
cards for the table-top game. I can pore over the statistics for
hours, until they begin to signify something more. My players have
come to seem like adopted children, their records like report
cards, and the post-season, if I have done my job, a kind of
graduation. After all, I have chosen them from a field of hundreds
in the Draft-O-Matic. I have placed them in the lineup, the
pitching rotation and the substitution slots to accentuate their
natural gifts and compensate for their defects. And _ just to
puncture this father analogy _ I have traded them ruthlessly and
opportunistically in the Swap-O-Matic when they have repeatedly
disappointed me.
</P>
<P>
   I suspect the appeal of statistics lies partly in their
distinctiveness and partly in their purity. In life, we can know
relatively little of other people's hearts and minds, and
statistics represent, if not absolute certainty, then at least a
refreshing illusion of certainty _ that what has been might be
again. If action-oriented baseball games live for the fleeting
moment of the pitch, the swing and the catch, statistic-oriented
ones speak to tendencies: the streak, the slump, a gift for
hammering lefties with two on and two out.
</P>
<P>
   It is agreeable to find Strat-O-Matic now also speaking in a
non-numeric voice. After each game, the software generates a
newspaper-style game report, complete with a description of the key
plays, a modest sense of context and even occasional cliched
quotes.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, the computer game Baseball Mogul did that first, but it
is delightful to find it here. A peculiar validation springs from
reading about events that you have engineered _ rather like hearing
yourself discussed by passengers on a bus _ and it is interesting
to see how your games look from the outside. This is a voice I
would like to encounter more often between the numbers, and I
wonder if the game's publisher could find a way to integrate the
vast storehouse of accumulated data into its sports-writing machine

&HT;     TEXAS GROUP SEEKS TOUGHER RULES FOR OIL, GAS PRODUCERS 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By RUSSELL GOLD  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Antonio Express-News

<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ A report prepared by energy industry
representatives and large landowners urges the state to crack down
on oil and gas producers who abandon wells without properly
plugging them.
</P>
<P>
   The orphaned wells threaten aquifers and force the state to bear
the clean-up costs, the report says.
</P>
<P>
   The report was delivered this week to Texas Railroad Commission
Chairman Michael Williams, who convened the group. Williams is
reviewing the recommendations and will present specific proposals
to the three-member Railroad Commission, which sets state oil and
gas policy.
</P>
<P>
   The report comes as regulators, the industry and landowners
struggle to find a new way to oversee oil and gas production in
Texas.
</P>
<P>
   There is widespread agreement the current system lets too many
``bad actors'' and poorly financed companies walk away from their
depleted wells, leaving behind expensive headaches for the state.
</P>
<P>
   The proposals include letting fewer companies pay the $100
annual fee to operate. More would have to provide a larger
performance bond, lien or nonrefundable fee. Also, the report
suggested that companies should be required to either plug or
produce wells after four years, ending an increasingly common
practice of keeping them idle indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
   Far from fostering a consensus, the report is drawing criticism
for being too weak.
</P>
<P>
   A top commission official wrote an ``alternative proposal'' that
suggested even more aggressive action might be warranted.
</P>
<P>
   ``The potential for pollution by those wells has continued to
increase and decisive action is necessary,'' Colin Lineberry, the
assistant director of the commission's oil and gas section, wrote
in a memorandum.
</P>
<P>
   He noted that a decade after the state created a cleanup fund to
aggressively deal with abandoned wells, the problems appear to be
worse than ever.
</P>
<P>
   The number of documented inactive wells rose 59 percent to
102,000 over the past 10 years, even as the number of wells plugged
by companies dropped 42 percent to 5,912 a year, he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   State rules require monitoring of inactive wells, but many
observers worry that as the number of inactive wells grows so does
the incidence of oil well-related contamination. An unplugged or
improperly plugged well can let extremely salty brine ruin
freshwater aquifers.
</P>
<P>
   The proposals ``are an important step in the right direction,
but more needs to be done,'' wrote A. Scott Anderson, executive
vice president of the Texas Independent Producers and Royalty
Owners Association, or TIPRO.
</P>
<P>
   TIPRO officials have expressed concern about the number of
unplugged wells, which at the existing pace will take 20 years to
plug.
</P>
<P>
   The commission cannot close abandoned wells at a faster pace
because of the limited number of available plugging contractors,
too little money in the cleanup fund and too few employees to
supervise plugging.
</P>
<P>
   Generally, the commission has tried to keep wells unplugged,
even wells that produce only a couple barrels a day, because they
may have economic value in the future. Operators are allowed to pay
$100 for a one-year extension to keep an unproductive well idle
rather than going though the expense of plugging it.
</P>
<P>
   This W-1X extension program, created in 1988, is being abused,
particularly by a handful of bad operators, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real and most immediate problem is that the W-1X option is
also available to operators who have not demonstrated that they are
willing and financially able to operate responsibly,'' the report
said.
</P>
<P>
   Some operators are getting extension after extension without
taking steps to put the wells back into production. These wells can
end up abandoned or sold.
</P>
<P>
   In April, a plan by Commissioner Tony Garza to limit producers
to a single extension was voted down, so operators still can get an
unlimited number of extensions.
</P>
<P>
   The industry group would like to create a four-year limit, as
well as require more financial assurance, or bonding, for certain
operators.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't go near far enough, but it's so much better than
what we had before that overall I have to say I'm pleased,'' said
Ceci Wallen, mineral and land manager for the San Antonio-based
Petty Ranch Co.
</P>
<P>
   Wallen, who represented the Texas Land and Mineral Owners
Association in the group, said she was surprised state rules let
operators with a poor compliance history buy wells and idle them.
</P>
<P>
   ``The concept of approving a known bad actor is just bizarre to
me,'' she said, ``but that's what has been happening.''

SEARCHING THE WEB AS A MATTER OF LIFE AND DEATH
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Md., Minn. , Ill., Netherlands)  By MICHAEL POLLAK   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Daniel Brown, a 32-year-old lawyer in Bethesda, Md., got the
news in February that he had chronic myelogenous leukemia and that
no one in his family had the proper genetic match to donate
life-saving bone marrow.
</P>
<P>
   The disease kills 60 percent to 70 percent of patients within
five years of diagnosis, according to bone-marrow specialists.
``Time is not on your side,'' said Brown's wife, Jolie. ``So some
families do their own bone-marrow drive, and that's what we've
done. We're not going to sit around and wait.''
</P>
<P>
   Within three weeks after hearing the diagnosis, the Browns were
calling every friend and organization they knew, printing fliers
and setting up drives to attract volunteer donors whose marrow
might provide the critical match of proteins needed for a
successful transplant.
</P>
<P>
   The family did something else, too. They got on the Internet,
establishing their own Web site, Tomorrow for Dan
(www.viaduct.com/helpdan). It is not just a plea for help; it is
also a brief primer on the disease, a family photo album and a link
to the National Marrow Donor Program (www.marrow.org) and the donor
program the Browns are working with, the Gift of Life Foundation
(www.hlamatch.org).
</P>
<P>
   Brown estimated that his family and volunteers directly sent out
at least 10,000 e-mail messages, not including those forwarded by
their recipients. ``It's clearly opened a door that didn't exist
previously, to allow you to communicate with a mass number of
people in a short period of time,'' Brown said. It gave him a huge
respect, he said, for the patients and groups that previously had
to rely on direct mail.
</P>
<P>
   Bone-marrow donor registries and the Internet have grown up
together in the last 10 years, and both have revolutionized the
potential of bone-marrow transplants when a matching donor cannot
be found in a patient's immediate family.
</P>
<P>
   Since the National Marrow Donor Program, a nonprofit
organization based in Minneapolis, began in 1986, the number of
volunteer potential donors registered with it has risen to just
under 4 million, from fewer than 100,000 at the beginning of 1990.
As of May 14, the program had been involved in 9,715 transplants of
stem cells from unrelated donors, compared with 533 by 1990. Stem
cells are what transplant patients need to make new, healthy
marrow.
</P>
<P>
   It is much harder to match types of bone marrow than types of
blood. People have about a 30 percent chance of matching with a
family member. If that fails, the next option is to search
registries of people who have volunteered to donate marrow. On
average, about 1 in 20,000 unrelated people match closely enough
for a bone-marrow donation.
</P>
<P>
   The number of registered potential donors has roughly doubled
since the first of the program's Web sites was set up in 1995.
``Originally we created a site with a target audience of
physicians,'' said Devan Shepherd, director of information systems.
``We discovered that patients and their families were using it.''
</P>
<P>
   The program's computer system manages all patient searches,
tracks detailed patient histories and maintains the
4-million-member registry. At any time, it is processing searches
for more than 3,000 patients. The donor program communicates online
daily with 350 to 400 groups around the country, including
hospitals, community groups and donor centers.
</P>
<P>
   In transplant centers, Shepherd said, new online tools provided
by the program shorten the time it takes to search national and
international registries to find matches. In some cases, the search
for a potential unrelated stem-cell donor that used to take a day
can now be done in seconds.
</P>
<P>
   There are dozens of independent bone-marrow and related
registries worldwide, and they do not share all their information.
Most, but not all, do share the basic tissue data for the more than
6.4 million people worldwide who have given samples; it is
forwarded to Bone Marrow Donors Worldwide, in Leiden, Netherlands.
That group's Web site, www.bmdw.org, is open to doctors and the
public, and includes technical data, information about how to
become a marrow donor, extensive links to more information about
the procedure and cancer treatment, and information on donor
registries worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not updated as often as some of us would like,'' said Dr.
Dennis L. Confer, the chief medical officer for the National Marrow
Donor Program. The international registry updates its list monthly.
For information other than the basic tissue types, doctors have to
write, phone or send faxes or e-mail to the individual registries,
Confer said.
</P>
<P>
   ``More and more, the ability to access donors through online
communications is going to become the norm,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Pamela J. Weisdorf, director of the program's office of patient
advocacy, said its Web site was being redesigned for
user-friendliness with the help of a 12-member advisory group,
including patients and their family members. ``They want
information about their disease,'' sometimes even before they know
they need a transplant, she said. ``One of the other things they
tell us is, `Please, you have to put things into language we can
understand.'''
</P>
<P>
   There is also a difference between Web language and medical
language. Take the word ``search,'' Weisdorf said. It means one
thing to most Internet users, but to patients facing a
life-or-death deadline, it means searching for an unrelated-donor
match.
</P>
<P>
   A related site, BMT Information (www.bmtinfo.org) is a
cooperative effort of the National Marrow Donor Program and the
national and international donor registries, and receives federal
financing. It has a glossary and an Ask the Expert section, with
doctors' answers to submitted questions.
</P>
<P>
   Another online resource is the Blood and Marrow Transplant
Newsletter (www.bmtnews.org), run from Highland Park, Ill. It lists
books that can be ordered online and links patients with people who
have undergone the process. It has a database of more than 250
transplant centers that can be searched by location, type of
disease treated and type of transplant offered. The newsletter also
has an online directory of specialized health care organizations
with more information, and guidance for patients with fund-raising
needs and insurance problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``It became apparent that a lot of people were starting to get
their information in the wee hours using their computers,'' said
Susan K. Stewart, executive director of BMT Infonet, a small
nonprofit group that sponsors the newsletter. It gets about 100,000
hits a month, she added.

<P>
   With the help of the Gift of Life Foundation, which is open to
anyone but has focused on patients and donors of Eastern European
Jewish background, the Brown family organized six drives for Daniel
through early May, attracting 7,238 potential donors who had their
blood tested. (Having your tissue type determined and getting on
the registry is like having a blood test in a doctor's office, and
requires only a test tube's worth.)
</P>
<P>
   One of the 703 blood donors at the April 31 drive at the Central
Synagogue in Manhattan, David Wohl, 29, was a fraternity brother of
Daniel Brown's, but had been three years behind him and knew him
only vaguely. ``I received an e-mail from another frat brother,''
Wohl said. The news shocked him. ``I felt for Dan and his family,''
he said. ``I went to the Web site and read more.''
</P>
<P>
   Evan Cowit, 31, a lawyer and a friend of a friend of Daniel
Brown's, also donated. Without the e-mail he received, he said, he
probably would never have heard about the drive. ``I sent it around
to everyone I could think of who was Eastern European Jewish and
who hadn't already got it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In late May, the Browns were informed that at least two
potential matching donors had been identified, and those tissue
samples are undergoing further tests. Because of confidentiality
rules, they do not know whether the donors had been previously
registered or if one of them came from their family's drives for
Dan. Regardless, to Jolie Brown, their efforts were worth it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of the thousands of people we're trying to test,'' Brown said,
``we'll surely save somebody's life, and that is a wonderful
feeling.''  &QL;

&HT;     HERSH DEFENDS HIS CLAIMS OF U.S. GULF WAR ILLEGALITIES 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By ERIC ROSENBERG  
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Pulitzer-prize winning journalist Seymour Hersh on
Wednesday defended his controversial assertions that Army Gen.
Barry McCaffrey ordered an unprovoked assault against retreating
Iraqi troops two days after the cease fire ending the 1991 Persian
Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think McCaffrey's action was an absolute violation,
certainly of a commander's responsibility to act proportionately,
and a violation of international law,'' Hersh told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   During the Gulf War, McCaffrey was a major general commanding
the 24th Mechanized Infantry Division. He retired in 1996 as a
four-star general and is now President Clinton's drug policy
adviser.
</P>
<P>
   McCaffrey and representatives of the White House and the Defense
Department have denied Hersh's claims.
</P>
<P>
   President Bush announced the cease fire on Feb. 28, 1991, after
U.S. forces had routed the Iraqi military in only 100 hours of
ground combat.
</P>
<P>
   As the Iraqi troops departed Kuwait on their way north to Iraq,
McCaffrey ordered his division to stay close to the retreating
Iraqis, a move that Hersh called ``an amazing act of arrogance''
because, according to the author, McCaffrey had put his troops in
harm's way for no valid military reason.
</P>
<P>
   On March 2, according to Hersh's article, the U.S. force
attacked the Iraqi units. The American forces shelled Iraqi troops
and tanks, even though the tanks were being ferried home on flatbed
trucks. Hersh said he didn't know the extent of Iraqi casualties,
though McCaffrey told Congress after the war that there were some
400 Iraqi casualties in this engagement.
</P>
<P>
   An Army investigation concluded that McCaffrey's troops had been
provoked by weapons fire, a finding that was contradicted by the
military personnel cited in Hersh's article.
</P>
<P>
   Hersh said the original tip for his lengthy 32-page New Yorker
article came from a retired four-star U.S. officer, who, like
several other military officials, was ``enraged'' by McCaffrey's
actions.
</P>
<P>
   In the article, Hersh quotes several Army officials by name who
say that the attack on the Iraqis was unprovoked.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Lt. Col. Patrick Lamar, the division's operations
officer, told Hersh that the attack was a ``giant hoax'' in which
Iraqis who put up little or no resistance were decimated by
overwhelming U.S. force.Retired Lt. Gen. James H. Johnson Jr., who
commanded the 82nd Airborne in the Gulf War, was quoted in the
magazine as saying that ``there was no need to be shooting at
anybody'' on March 2, 1991. ``They couldn't surrender fast enough.
The war was over.''
</P>
<P>
   Hersh's article also alleged that 24th Division forces fired on
at least 380 Iraqi prisoners on Feb. 27, 1991, one day before the
cease fire. In Hersh's account, based on on-the-record comments
from eyewitness troops and an audio tape of radio conversations
during the event, U.S. forces had disarmed the prisoners and
radioed their location to other troops, who later opened fire with
machine guns on Bradley fighting vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   Hersh, who broke the story of the massacre of Vietnamese
civilians at My Lai during the Vietnam War, said Wednesday that one
of the companies under McCaffrey's command was ``out of control''
and ``shooting everything.''
</P>
<P>
   The Army and McCaffrey deny Hersh's allegations. The Army said
that it had already investigated the post-cease fire assault and
cleared McCaffrey and his troops of any wrongdoing on the basis
that U.S. forces were provoked by the Iraqis.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of the POWs, the Army said ``there was no evidence
to indicate that members of the (24th Infantry) killed or
mistreated (Iraqi POWs).''
</P>
<P>
   McCaffrey attacked Hersh's article as ``revisionist history.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Hersh has the safe luxury of armchair quarterbacking the every
move of the 24th Infantry during the Gulf War, 10 years after the
fact. We did not have that luxury,'' McCaffrey said. ``We were out
there fighting the fourth largest army in the world, which was
armed with chemical and biological weapons .''
</P>
<P>
   The New York Times and a Gulf War veteran's group have called
for an investigation into allegations.

 &HT;    TURNER AND HIS CABLE EMPIRE WILL BE STRONGER, AOL EXEC SAYS
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The man who soon will replace Ted Turner as head of
the Turner cable TV empire said Wednesday its employees should not
fear layoffs or editorial meddling when the new parent company, AOL
Time Warner Inc., takes over.
</P>
<P>
   And they should ignore a recent newspaper story that suggested
Turner won't have much influence over the businesses he created,
said Robert Pittman, chief operating officer of America Online
Inc., the Internet giant that plans to absorb Time Warner Inc.,
parent company of Turner Broadcasting System.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there is a 'post-Ted Turner' era'' coming after
the merger, Pittman said in a telephone interview. ``I think Ted's
going to have more influence than he had before, because I fully
expect that he'll have a say in a lot broader areas of the company
than just Turner networks and CNN.''
</P>
<P>
   Pittman added that the Atlanta-based executives who make
decisions about salaries for Turner employees, such as baseball and
basketball players, will continue to operate as independently as
they have under Time Warner.
</P>
<P>
   A management reorganization plan released in May showed Turner
would no longer head the Time Warner division that includes
operations he built or bought, including CNN, TBS, TNT, the Atlanta
Braves and the Atlanta Hawks.
</P>
<P>
   But Pittman dismissed a story Friday in the Los Angeles Times
that said Turner was unhappy about not getting a formal operating
role in the immense new company. ``I thought it was so far off the
mark in terms of what Ted is in this company,'' he said. ``I
couldn't quite understand where all of that was coming from.''
</P>
<P>
   Given that shareholders still have to approve the merger of the
Internet giant and the media company, Pittman and other AOL
executives have a stake in Turner's happiness. In a merged company,
Turner would be the largest individual shareholder, with about 4
percent of the stock.
</P>
<P>
   Shareholders will vote June 23 on the proposed combination. The
world's biggest Internet service provider, AOL, will hold its
shareholder meeting in Vienna, Va., a suburb of Washington, while
shareholders of Time Warner will gather in New York.
</P>
<P>
   If approved, AOL Chairman and Chief Executive Steve Case would
become the chairman of the new company, while Time Warner Chairman
and Chief Executive Gerald Levin will serve as chief executive of
AOL Time Warner. Pittman will be co-chief operating officer, along
with Time Warner president Richard Parsons. Turner will be vice
chairman, a role without day-to-day operating power.
</P>
<P>
   The merger also has to win the approval of government regulators
concerned about concentration of power in the media. Given that the
deal is not yet done, Turner could cause trouble if he decided to
fight it.
</P>
<P>
   Pittman said he had no fears about Turner making a late effort
to derail the deal because Turner wants AOL's resources to boost
the companies he created.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just talked to Ted last week and just went over a fairly
extensive list'' of improvements that Turner wants at CNN, he said.
``I fully expect to make that (list) part of my mandate.''
</P>
<P>
   Cable viewers, too, have nothing to fear from an AOL and Time
Warner merger, such as a pullback in CNN's coverage of breaking
news around the world, Pittman said. ``They've gone global probably
better than any other TV network,'' he said. ``All we're going to
do is expand their opportunities and probably give them additional
resources.''
</P>
<P>
   Pittman said Tom Johnson ``absolutely'' will continue to run
CNN, and will do so with the editorial freedom he always has had.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, Pittman has said that a combined company would be
able to save $1 billion a year. But those savings will not come
from cutbacks in staff or spending on news or sports teams, but
instead from ``synergies'' achieved primarily in advertising, he
said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of (the savings) are linked to shared marketing,'' he
said. ``We spend at AOL about a billion a year on marketing. If we
re-purpose those dollars and buy from existing Time Warner
properties _ the magazine group, the Turner networks, etc. _ in
areas where we are not displacing a paying advertiser, that money
all drops to the bottom line.''
</P>
<P>
   Pittman, 46, says he believes he has an especially close
relationship with Turner because their careers have followed
similar paths. Pittman started as a radio disk jockey in his native
Mississippi. In 1980, while Turner was creating CNN, Pittman was
thinking up another cable TV ``first.'' In 1981, he made his mark
as the programmer who created MTV.
</P>
<P>
   Under Pittman's leadership, MTV Networks grew into the first
profitable basic cable network company. He also helped create the
VH-1 and Nick at Nite cable television channels.
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, Pittman sold Quantum Media Inc., an entertainment
company he helped found, to Time Warner. He then went to work for
Time Warner, helping overhaul its Six Flags amusement parks. He
left Time Warner and spent a short time as chief executive of
Century 21 Real Estate Corp. In 1996, joined America Online, which
means he now has the advantage of having been an executive for both
AOL and Time Warner.

STUDY SAYS LEATHERBACK TURTLE FACING EXTINCTION

 By HENRY FOUNTAIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Leatherback turtles, whose numbers in the Pacific
have plunged in recent years, will all but disappear within a
decade unless commercial fishing practices are changed, according
to a new analysis of the giant animals' nesting activity.
</P>
<P>
   The turtles, which nest on beaches and then spend almost all of
their lives in the open sea, have been dying in large numbers _ at
least 1,500 females every year, by some estimates _ caught in the
long lines and nets used by commercial fishers.
</P>
<P>
   This level of mortality, combined with the natural high
mortality of turtle hatchlings, means that the population is
unsustainable, according to the analysis, a computer model devised
by scientists at Drexel University in Philadelphia who have studied
the turtles' nesting activity at a major site in Costa Rica since
1988.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rate of adult mortality is too high,'' said Richard Reina,
a marine biologist at Drexel and one of the authors of the study,
which is being reported Thursday in the journal Nature. ``They just
can't recover.''
</P>
<P>
   From a high of 1,367 females that nested at Playa Grande, Costa
Rica, in 1988, the model forecasts that fewer than 50 will nest by
the year 2004, a number that means the turtles will be effectively
wiped out in the Pacific Ocean.
</P>
<P>
   Efforts to protect the turtles where they nest will only delay
reaching that number by about five years, Reina noted. ``Our model
always predicted extinction,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Cynthia Lagueux, a zoologist with the Wildlife Conservation
Society who is working on a turtle project in Nicaragua, said there
was general agreement among scientists that turtle populations were
declining, particularly in the Pacific.
</P>
<P>
   ``But there's lots of disagreement or discussion on where the
regression line will hit zero,'' Lagueux said.
</P>
<P>
   John A. Musick, a sea turtle specialist with the Virginia
Institute of Marine Science, said: ``There's no doubt that
something has to be done for those Pacific leatherbacks.
Extirpation of those breeding populations is probably inevitable.''
</P>
<P>
   Leatherbacks, which can weigh 800 pounds or more and are listed
as endangered by the World Conservation Union, return to the same
beaches to lay their eggs on average every three years. At Playa
Grande, the scientists tagged females to determine whether and with
what frequency they returned.
</P>
<P>
   The scientists found that not only were the overall number of
nesting turtles declining sharply, but also that the number of
returning females fell far below what was expected. The researchers
ruled out an increase in the time between nesting as a cause, and
conducted aerial surveys of the entire western coastline of Central
America to determine that the turtles were not nesting elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   The only explanation, the researchers said, is that the turtles
are dying during the years they migrate throughout the ocean. And
although the fishing industry's reports on what is known as the
bycatch _ unintended victims hauled in along with the fish being
sought _ tends to be poor, particularly in Asia, the few reports
available indicated that leatherbacks were being killed in
substantial numbers.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the evidence showed that this was the cause,'' Reina said.
</P>
<P>
   Most turtle conservation efforts have involved building of
hatcheries and protecting nesting beaches from human activity.
Reina said that while these steps were important, ``you're working
on the wrong end of the equation.''
</P>
<P>
   What is needed, he said, are several modifications of commercial
fishing practices. Exclusion zones, where fishing would be banned
at certain times of the year, could be established in known turtle
migration corridors, he said. And a limit to the length of time
long lines are in the water would mean that the turtles that are
caught would be less likely to drown.
</P>
<P>
   Reina also said that more independent observers were needed on
boats to ensure that live turtles hauled on board were returned to
the sea still alive. Now, he said, it is more convenient and cost
effective for the crew to kill or permanently disable the turtle to
get the hook out.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really comes down to time and effort,'' Reina said. ``For a
commercial fishing boat, time is money. Hooks are money. Nets are
money. Turtles are not money.''

&HT;     49ERS RUNNING BACK VOWS TO PLAY IN 2000 SEASON 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By JOHN CRUMPACKER

<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA CLARA, Calif. _ As he sat in an equipment cart, his
elevated left leg in a cast, Garrison Hearst talked confidently of
returning to football despite 16 months away from the game with
what might be the most troublesome ankle injury in NFL history.
</P>
<P>
   You remember Hearst. Tough guy, locker room funnyman, started
the 1998 season with a 96-yard touchdown run in overtime against
the Jets and ended it with a broken left leg in a playoff game
against Atlanta on Jan. 9, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Hearst missed the entire 1999 season and faces more down time in
2000 after surgery in Seattle three weeks ago in which Dr. Pierce
Scranton performed a procedure that is designed to stimulate blood
flow to his ankle.
</P>
<P>
   The bone he broke 16 months ago has long since healed. The
problem is the ankle developed necrosis as a result of the injury;
the joint was dying because circulation had become compromised.
Necrosis of the hip forced Bo Jackson to retire from football a
decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   Hearst is scheduled to have the cast removed on Friday, at which
time he will be fitted with a walking boot that will aid his
rehabilitation. Still, the earliest Hearst could return if his
recovery goes well is October. There is also the possibility that
he could miss another full season as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``Feeling good,'' is how the San Francisco 49ers running back
described himself. ``It was four weeks in this, three weeks in a
walking boot and we'll see how things go after that. I always kept
my head up about this injury.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked what he expected of himself this season, he said, ``I
expect to play.''
</P>
<P>
   At this point, Hearst in uniform would be a bonus for the 49ers.
The club is prepared to play the season without him as it did last
year, when, with Charlie Garner's 1,229 yards, the 49ers led the
league in rushing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have my fingers crossed,'' coach Steve Mariucci said Tuesday
of Hearst, after the first of a four-day minicamp for rookies and
selected veterans. ``If you have Garrison with you, then it's icing
on the cake. We have to prepare to be without him, as we were last
year. We have everyone back. We should be as good or better than
last year.''
</P>
<P>
   Because it has been so long since Hearst has been able to run
unfettered, his cardiovascular condition is what he will have to
attack when and if his ankle permits. In the meantime, his work in
the weight room shows in an upper body that is thicker than it was
in 1998, when Hearst rushed for a club-record 1,570 yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the hardest part,'' he said of his long recovery. ``I
see my progress every day and keep working until I reach that next
level. I feel very comfortable about the surgery. It's been rough,
but I just think positive.''

BOLSHOI BALLET: STRIFE BETWEEN ARISTOCRATS AND THE CHILDREN OF
TOMORROW

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ It was not just another company, another show. The
return of the Bolshoi Ballet from Moscow for its first U.S. tour in
10 years fills a gap for U.S. audiences that has been sorely felt.
</P>
<P>
   No other foreign ballet company had the explosive impact on the
West that the Bolshoi did when it first appeared in London in 1956
and in New York in 1959.
</P>
<P>
   The troupe has certainly had its ups and downs over the decades.
But the Bolshoi has never lost the effect of the initial images it
impressed upon the eye. Here was power in technique, dramatic
projection and even choreographic novelty. Every American ballerina
held aloft in an overhead lift by her partner owes something to the
Bolshoi, as does the cascade of ballets throughout the world that
are set to Prokofiev's ``Romeo and Juliet.''
</P>
<P>
   There is nonetheless only one landmark version of the Prokofiev
score, and it is the version by Leonid Lavrovsky with which the
Bolshoi opened on Tuesday night at the John F. Kennedy Center for
the Performing Arts here.
</P>
<P>
   It is a magnificent ballet, a museum piece of extraordinary
dimension that is couched in a style of dramatic realism that is
very difficult for contemporary dancers to capture. In a somewhat
diluted version, it was the surprise hit of the Kirov Ballet's 1992
season at the Metropolitan Opera House in New York. Then as on
Tuesday, the ballet was led by Nina Ananiashvili, a guest with the
Kirov, and now even more of a poignant Juliet with a Bolshoi Romeo,
the noble Andrei Uvarov.
</P>
<P>
   Prokofiev wrote his now overly popular score (heard on one U.S.
television commercial too many) for the ``Romeo and Juliet'' that
Lavrovsky choreographed in 1940 for the Kirov Ballet in Leningrad.
When Lavrovsky and his legendary Juliet, Galina Ulanova,
transferred to Moscow after World War II, he restaged the ballet
with some changes in 1946. It is with this Bolshoi version that the
company made its historic debut in New York in 1959.
</P>
<P>
   It was a stupefying production (also seen on film with Ulanova)
that initially left critics and audience stunned, sometimes
baffled. Above all, it was an exercise in Stanislavsky-type
realism, with each dancer, down to every beggar in Verona,
motivated by meaning in gesture. What looked like silent acting was
a flow of dance and modern mime that was direct rather than
symbolic.
</P>
<P>
   In tune with Soviet times, Lavrovsky cast ``Romeo and Juliet''
as a class drama: a bold and sprawling picture of the people
contrasted with haughty aristocrats who crushed the human spirit.
</P>
<P>
   The Soviet dance historian Yuri Slonimsky saw Lavrovsky's theme
as ``the unequal struggle waged by the children of tomorrow against
the injustice of yesterday.'' Lavrovsky, however, never lost sight
of the love story while placing it in an interpretive social
context. And unlike the later Western versions that he himself
spawned, his ``Romeo and Juliet'' reconciled the Capulets and
Montagues at the end, thus remaining true to Shakespeare.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the Kirov revival, the current Bolshoi version does not
turn its aristocrats into cartoons. Andrei Sitnikov is not an
exaggerated Lord Capulet but rather an autocratic patriarch enraged
by his daughter's refusal to marry Paris. After she has taken her
potion and he thinks she is dead, his pain, hand to heart, is
telegraphed with intensity and depth.
</P>
<P>
   The Kirov's Paris was vain, but Alexei Barsegyan, as a
strong-willed but uncomprehending youth, merely looked into a
mirror held by his page and did not preen. Similarly, when
Lavrovsky has Tybalt kick a peddler, the scene is part of a social
fabric not a vicious image for its own sake.
</P>
<P>
   The Bolshoi has brought along the famous checkerboard floor that
the Kirov omitted and that is such a striking part of the sets and
costumes by Pyotr Williams. Williams was a major Russian designer,
and the Renaissance luxury he created for the Leningrad and Moscow
productions is felt especially in his ballroom scene in Act I and
the richly patterned drapes of Juliet's bedroom in Act III, which
precedes the epilogue and its reconciliation of the clans.
</P>
<P>
   But the opera house stage at the Kennedy Center is too small to
give full justice to the pictorial power of this ``Romeo,'' which
is to be repeated with other casts on Saturday afternoon and
evening. ``Don Quixote,'' in a new production by Alexei Fadeyechev,
the Bolshoi Ballet's artistic director since 1998, will also be
performed on this five-city tour presented by the Kennedy Center
with David Eden productions: ``Don Quixote,'' led by Ananiashvili
on Thursday night, will be repeated Friday night and Sunday
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   The creased look of the old scenery in the beginning could be
eliminated with better lighting. But despite the cramped space, the
animated crowd scenes with their wonderful folk-flavored dances in
heels and boots gradually build up in the town square. The statues
there differ from those in the Kirov version, focusing on David,
slayer of Goliath. Another change has Juliet wearing a different
cross around her neck with every formal gown, which Ulanova
certainly did not.
</P>
<P>
   How much the ``Romeo and Juliet'' of Kenneth Macmillan (1965)
and John Cranko (1963) owe to Lavrovsky's Capulet ball is obvious.
The Bolshoi wall tapestry depicts a Lady Godiva and three goddesses
with three golden apples. (In 1992 the Kirov had Europa on her
bull.) Whatever the decor, the overall dramatic effect is stunning,
opening on a banquet with Tybalt atop a table and lounging
courtiers. This bacchanalian decadence is then channeled into the
famous dance with the cushions. The Capulets advance, holding
pillows, kneel on them and grab their partners in a passionate
embrace.
</P>
<P>
   Ananiashvili and Uvarov, as well as Maria Alexandrova and Sergei
Filin, who lead the classical divertissements at the ball and Act
III, are outstanding dancers. Nikolai Tsiskaridze's charismatic
Mercutio and Dmitri Belogovtsev's aptly hardened Tybalt rounded out
a fine cast of principals. Yet they act like contemporary dancers
everywhere, and Lavrovsky's ``Romeo and Juliet'' is very special.
To move from position to position in a duet is not its style. It is
a danced play that requires no break in style.
</P>
<P>
   To be touched by Ananiashvili's performance was easy: It is
filled with intelligence and nuance, a Juliet who is overtaken by
events and deeply in love. That she dominates the ballet,
overshadowing her Romeo, is not a surprise.
</P>
<P>
   Alexander Kopylov conducted the Kennedy Center orchestra: It was
too expensive to bring the Bolshoi's own to the tour, which
includes Chicago (Tuesday through June 10), Seattle (June 14-18),
Los Angeles (June 21-25) and Orange County Performing Arts Center
in Costa Mesa, Calif. (June 27 to July 2).

IT SHARES CUSTODY, BUT PBS GETS THE TONYS FIRST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, June 4) 
 By ANITA GATES   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Jeff Folmsbee seems calmer now. ``Do You Wanna
Dance?'' is playing, and Boyd Gaines is onstage in the empty Vivian
Beaumont Theater, wooing Deborah Yates, better known as the Girl in
the Yellow Dress (but at the moment wearing a fleece top and
pants). A crew of five is filming the couple's every move as they
run through a scene from Susan Stroman's dance play ``Contact.''
The crew has already shot Stroman leading a rehearsal of dancers
and a rehearsal of the show's 18th-century girl-in-a-swing scene.
</P>
<P>
   Folmsbee, who is carrying a collection of a dozen or so
scribbled-on Playbills, was pacing earlier in the day. At this
point in early May, the Tony Awards are less than five weeks away
but the nominations have yet to be announced, so he and his team
are running around town madly filming shows they are guessing will
be nominated. This film will go into the documentary segments that
dot the first hour of the Tony Awards telecast Sunday night at 8).
You know, the hour that's on PBS before the CBS show begins.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people may think of us as the preshow, but we're not,''
says Folmsbee, the hour's co-executive producer, understandably
offended by the notion. This year, he hopes, that point is being
made more forcefully than before. The title of the hour is ``The
First 10 Awards: Tonys 2000'' (last year it was ``Broadway '99:
Launching the Tonys,'' which the producers concede may have
contributed to the misconception). The first-hour show is getting
equal space with the CBS show on the official posters. Rosie
O'Donnell _ who is returning as host of the overall telecast _ will
be acting as live host of the first hour, with Nathan Lane as
co-host.
</P>
<P>
   Lane put in a plug for the PBS hour on O'Donnell's daytime talk
show last Tuesday (a good thing, since the show has been promoting
the awards as ``this Sunday on CBS at 9 p.m.''). ``It's like the
early part of the party,'' he said, urging viewers to tune in.
O'Donnell chimed in, ``It's like the cocktail party _ with
awards.'' O'Donnell and Lane will open the show with a glitzy
number to the tune of Stephen Sondheim's ``Comedy Tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It will reinforce what is true,'' says Folmsbee. ``This is a
three-hour ceremony on two networks.''
</P>
<P>
   When that three-hour broadcast begins, Folmsbee and the
documentary segments' producer, Mark Mannucci, will be in black tie
but packed with other workers inside a control room on wheels, a
huge tractor-trailer truck parked near Radio City Music Hall. It's
a CBS truck.
</P>
<P>
   This strange dual-network arrangement began in 1997 after the
League of American Theaters and Producers and the American Theater
Wing, which present the Tonys, approached WNET (Channel 13), New
York's public broadcasting station. CBS _ troubled, like other
networks, by the growing and unpredictable length of awards
telecasts _ had decided it could no longer commit to more than a
two-hour show.
</P>
<P>
   The people at WNET said yes. ``I had some compassion for this,''
says Jac Venza, the station's director of culture and arts programs
and the show's other co-executive producer. In the past, he says,
when classical music shows he produced received awards, the
category was relegated to the off-air presentations.
</P>
<P>
   He does not consider the first hour of the Tonys a poor relation
to the CBS portion of the show, but he sees that attitude as par
for the course. ``Everything we've started was once thought of as
something the networks didn't want,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Lots of the hour's loyal viewers consider the first hour
superior to the rest of the telecast. ``Oh, I love the 8 o'clock
show,'' says David F. Richardson, a theater critic for WOR Radio.
``PBS always does a fantastic job. It's one of the best parts.''
</P>
<P>
   Bob Burrichter, a movie-theater marketing manager, feels the
same way. ``Wouldn't miss it,'' says Burrichter, a onetime theater
publicist. ``I just think it brings a whole different dimension to
watching the Tonys on TV. It gives the designers and the other
people behind the scenes their just due, and it nurtures interest
in the theater on the creative side, not just commercial.''
</P>
<P>
   Creatively, the show has been well received too. Mannucci, who
this year is producing five three-minute to nine-minute documentary
segments (on the musical season and on the nominated scenic
designers, lighting designers, costume designers and directors),
sees the segments as ``the heart of the hour.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You get to root for the people you saw,'' says Mannucci. ``The
stories are told from a human angle.'' There are the same humans
from the short films, sitting in the audience in evening wear,
chewing on their cuticles, accidentally applauding their own
nominations, preparing to look brave.
</P>
<P>
   The PBS hour has its critics as well. Last year, while CBS was
being lambasted for cutting a musical number from ``It Ain't
Nothin' but the Blues'' but keeping a deadly dramatic reading from
the nominated plays, WNET was being criticized for its treatment of
Uta Hagen. Hagen, who played Desdemona to Paul Robeson's Othello
and won Tonys for originating the lead female roles in ``Who's
Afraid of Virginia Woolf?'' and ``The Country Girl,'' was honored
with a lifetime achievement award. But she wasn't even asked to go
onstage. On the Oscars, a career like this would be occasion for
five minutes of film clips and a standing ovation. On the Tonys,
Hagen stood at her seat and waved. ``We got letters,'' Folmsbee
admits.
</P>
<P>
   With or without gaffes, for people who love theater, the show's
first hour has a glamour all its own. Last year the first
presenters were Alan Cumming (wearing a red shirt, a long black
jacket and what appeared to be a fishing hat), who had won for
``Cabaret'' the year before, and Audra McDonald, who has won for
``Carousel,'' ``Master Class'' and ``Ragtime.''
</P>
<P>
   The documentary segments included Kevin Spacey, on the stage set
of ``The Iceman Cometh,'' commenting on the experience of being
directed (``Sometimes you just say, `Just tell me how you want me
to say it'''), Kristin Chenoweth rehearsing her star-making
performance as Sally in ``You're a Good Man, Charlie Brown'' and
Harold Prince reflecting on why there will always be theater.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday night's segments will include this season's toasts of
Broadway, like Heather Headley of ``Aida,'' Stephen Dillane and
Jennifer Ehle of ``The Real Thing,'' and Philip Seymour Hoffman and
John C. Reilly of ``True West.''
</P>
<P>
   The hour's awards aren't just important; sometimes they're
historic. In 1998, after some 50 years of men having received the
best director Tonys, women were named best directors of a play
(Garry Hynes for ``The Beauty Queen of Leenane'') and of a musical
(Julie Taymor for ``The Lion King''). Both Hynes and Taymor
received their awards and made their speeches during the PBS show.
</P>
<P>
   Which, come to think of it, always ends promptly at 9 p.m. How
do they do it, while the commercial networks let Oscar and Emmy and
Grammy telecasts ramble on into Letterman-Leno territory?
</P>
<P>
   ``We have different versions of the segments _ long, short and
medium,'' says Mannucci. ``I don't want to tempt fate.''

NUREYEV'S PARTNER, THE CAMERA 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Russia, Australia, France, Britain)  ( For release Sunday, June 4)  
 By DAVID HAY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Thirty-four years ago, during the filming of his
ballet ``Le Jeune Homme et la Mort,'' the French choreographer
Roland Petit walked into Rudolf Nureyev's dressing room to check on
his star's makeup. ``He said to me, `Am I looking good?''' Petit
recalled recently. ``I said, `You're as good as Marilyn Monroe.' He
looked at me. `Is it a compliment?' I replied, `Of course.'''
</P>
<P>
   Like any star, Nureyev was anxious about his screen image. From
his early days in Leningrad, he used film to critique not only his
dancing but his curtain calls. ``The first time he saw 8-millimeter
footage which a friend shot at the end of a Kirov performance, he
became very depressed because his bows were, in his words,
`pathetic,''' said Wallace Potts, the film archivist for the Rudolf
Nureyev Foundation in Liechtenstein and the dancer's longtime
friend.
</P>
<P>
   But Nureyev's ideas about what film could do for dance extended
beyond his own personal use, in part because he developed a
sophisticated knowledge of film language. According to Potts,
Nureyev could describe the Odessa Steps montage in the classic 1925
film ``Potemkin'' ``as if he were some kind of VCR quickly playing
back the entire sequence.''
</P>
<P>
   As a consequence, Nureyev was keen to expand the scope of the
ballet film beyond preserving a particular choreography or
broadcasting a stage performance. For him, film could show off a
dancer's kinetic energy as well as provide a close-up of the
disciplined and expressive use of the body.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday through next Sunday the Film Society of Lincoln Center
is presenting ``This is Nureyev! A Weekend of Dance on Film,'' a
series of four programs that will be repeated on June 16 and 17 at
the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. Shot mostly during the 1960s,
when Nureyev was at his peak, the films provide an intimate look at
his extraordinary dancing prowess. They also bear witness to his
strong but seldom realized ambitions for the ballet film.
</P>
<P>
   The program starts with the earliest 35-millimeter film of
Nureyev dancing. In April 1958, he won first prize at the Moscow
National Classical Ballet Contest. In a voice-over to the
two-minute, black-and-white clip of his winning ``Le Corsaire''
solo, shot two days after the contest, the narrator notes that
``this artist is characterized by his hot temperament and
boldness.''
</P>
<P>
   Liuba Myasnikova, a close friend from Nureyev's student days and
now a research scientist at the Institute of the Academy of
Sciences in St. Petersburg, recalled in a telephone interview:
``His movements weren't as pure as they were later on. But he was
beside himself with joy at winning. He always wanted to be at the
top.''
</P>
<P>
   Not long after defecting to the West in 1961, Nureyev began his
legendary partnership with Margot Fonteyn. The magic of this
pairing is captured in an eight-minute excerpt of their 1965 ``Le
Corsaire'' pas de deux.
</P>
<P>
   The couple is also featured in the 126-minute filmed version of
Kenneth MacMillan's highly successful 1965 Royal Ballet production
of ``Romeo and Juliet,'' with the 46-year-old Fonteyn as Juliet.
This was supposed to have been a breakthrough in the ballet film,
because its director, Paul Czinner, placed eight cameras in front
of a sound stage at Pinewood Studios. According to production notes
from the time, this enabled Czinner to shoot ``the spectacle from
every conceivable angle.'' But the ploy did not make the experience
more intimate, and the result remains a standard theatrical
performance in which the audience is always distant from the
action.
</P>
<P>
   There was no time for cinematic experimentation during the
making of the documentary ``This Is Rudolf Nureyev'' in Spoleto,
Italy, in 1964. Never before publicly screened in this country, the
film shows Nureyev, at 26, flexing his wings as a choreographer for
the second company of the Royal Ballet, staging a production of
Petipa's ``Raymonda.'' In the 50-minute film, his persistent
attention to detail and encouragement of the company becomes a
fascinating portrait of a dancer truly obsessed.
</P>
<P>
   According to Potts, it was around this time that this obsession
with every facet of ballet led Nureyev to demand more input into
the films he was starring in.
</P>
<P>
   Being in front of the camera, however, often made this
difficult. He argued continuously with Pierre Jourdan, the director
of the documentary ``I Am a Dancer,'' begun in 1970, and finally
refused the producer's wish that only ``Rudolf Nureyev'' appear
above the title. As a way of expressing his displeasure, Nureyev
demanded that Margot Fonteyn be given equal billing, even though he
was the subject of the film.
</P>
<P>
   ``I Am a Dancer'' offers a rare glimpse into the daily rigors of
Nureyev's professional life. Arriving in a leather trench coat and
a cap, a very Russian outfit, he transforms a utilitarian dressing
room into a private haven, methodically unpacking his glittering
costumes and changing into a worn leotard. This is followed by a
rigorous warm-up, in which Jourdan's camera closely observes the
dancer's extraordinarily fast and controlled footwork.
</P>
<P>
   Originally shot for French television and including such period
gems as the complete Fredrick Ashton ballet ``Marguerite and
Armand,'' the film was expanded to feature length for theatrical
release. According to John Percival, the editor of the now defunct
Dance and Dancers who wrote the narration, Nureyev insisted that
the longer version show a broader range of his work.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, Jourdan included an extraordinary sequence of Nureyev and
Deanne Bergsma, their bodies often totally intertwined, rehearsing
Glen Tetley's modern ballet ``Field Figures.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There was this animal instinct, almost animal movement in him,
that made him fit quite naturally into every nuance of the
choreography,'' Tetley said recently.
</P>
<P>
   But suggestions about content were not enough for Nureyev. ``He
made sure the editor took his direction for the film rather than
the ostensible director's,'' Percival recalled.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In 1972, Nureyev finally got his chance to go behind the camera.
The 103-minute ``Don Quixote,'' scrupulously restored last year by
the Australian Broadcasting Corp., was directed by Nureyev and the
Australian dancer Robert Helpmann. It features members of the
Australian Ballet, and Nureyev performs the role of Basilio and
Lucette Aldous that of Kitri.
</P>
<P>
   As director, Nureyev took the camera onto the stage. ``He wanted
it to be one of the dancers,'' said Peter McDonald, the first
assistant cameraman.
</P>
<P>
   Both McDonald and the director of photography, Geoffrey
Unsworth, had joined Nureyev's crew following their work on Bob
Fosse's ``Cabaret'' and Stanley Kubrick's ``2001: A Space
Odyssey.'' Using an aircraft hangar in the Melbourne suburb of
Essendon, Nureyev took advantage of a colorful set twice the size
of a conventional stage. It was constructed to allow the dancers to
be captured from almost any angle, and Nureyev insisted that the
camera move at the same speed as the dancers.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the beginning he came out of the wings at 40 miles per hour
and went right past us,'' recalled McDonald, now a director, who
had to rely on six burly Australian grips to push the camera.
``After that, we learned how to keep up.''
</P>
<P>
   Whenever the disciplines of ballet and film collided, Nureyev
never wavered in his loyalty to his first love. ``He would never
want to cut to a close-up because he wanted at all times to
preserve what the body was doing,'' recalled Potts, who, in 1972,
was a first assistant director on ``Don Quixote.''
</P>
<P>
   The directing role suited Nureyev's temperament. ``When Barry
Kay was making my costume, Rudi would stand there, approving of
some it and tearing off the bits he didn't like,'' remembered
Aldous, who, at 61, is senior classical-ballet lecturer at the
Western Australian Academy of Performing Arts in Perth.
</P>
<P>
   Nureyev looked through the camera before every shot, and during
the editing of the film he moved its editor, along with his
Moviola, into the bedroom of his London flat. In a review in The
New York Times in November 1973, Anna Kisselgoff called ``Don
Quixote'' ``a dance film for all audiences, an exciting,
intelligently conceived spectacle.''
</P>
<P>
   Nureyev got only one more chance to get behind a camera. In
1986, he directed the Paris Opera's television production of ``The
Nutcracker,'' shot on videotape (it is not in the festival).
</P>
<P>
   ``Ballet film productions never made any money,'' said John
Hargreaves, the producer of ``Don Quixote.'' Probably no one would
be sadder about this than the film producer and distributor Walter
Reade, who put up $750,000 to make ``Don Quixote.'' Happily, in the
Lincoln Center theater that now bears Reade's name, what was
accomplished nearly three decades ago can now be seen again.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Has there ever been a more obscure Tony Award honoree
than Sylvia Herscher? Even Herscher herself does not think so.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who am I? I wasn't unique,'' she insisted recently, seated in
her favorite chair in her neat apartment on the 40th floor of
Manhattan Plaza, the artists' residence high above Theater Row on
West 42nd Street.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lots of people did what I did. It's just that I was lucky.
Timing. In real estate, it's location; in the theater, it's timing.
A confluence of everything coming together and a lot of luck.
That's all.''
</P>
<P>
   Most Tony Awards are self-explanatory. Best performance by a
featured actress in a musical; nothing could be clearer. Then there
is a relatively new award, dating from the early 1990s, something
called the ``Tony honor for excellence in theater.'' This year, the
actress Eileen Heckart, who starred in ``The Waverly Gallery'' Off
Broadway, and the popular ``Encores!,'' the seven-year-old concert
musical series at City Center, are recipients of the honor. Along
with Sylvia Herscher.
</P>
<P>
   Who?
</P>
<P>
   The facts are as follows. After a 50-year theatrical life
spanning several careers _ as a general manager, a producer, a
music publisher, an agent _ Sylvia Herscher, 86, is retired. She
was the second in command for the composer and producer Jule Styne
for many years and the composer Jerry Herman's self-avowed
``mentor'' for even longer. In her own words, she was ``a
theatrical matchmaker''; in Herman's words, ``the woman who
arranged things,'' the living embodiment of his greatest leading
lady, Dolly Levi herself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I brought Sylvia every one of my new scores first,'' Herman
readily acknowledged recently. ``I clung to her _ for her ears and
her instincts. You can't go to school for that. Sylvia, more than
anyone I've ever known, represented an entire world that has
disappeared.''
</P>
<P>
   Always, Herscher functioned in the offstage shadows. The threads
of her professional existence were spun with finesse. Unraveling
their intricate weave reveals one of the best-kept secrets, in a
sense, of Broadway's increasingly mythic past: a woman whose quiet
impact was felt on shows ranging from ``Gypsy'' to ``A Chorus
Line.''
</P>
<P>
   Her work with Styne, for example, included assisting on his
celebrated 1952 revival of Rodgers and Hart's ``Pal Joey'' _
literally sitting between the show's book writer, John O'Hara, and
its composer, Richard Rodgers, who would not speak to each other,
as their referee. She was the associate producer for Styne's hit
1955 production of the comedy ``Will Success Spoil Rock Hunter?,''
and his general manager for the musicals ``Hazel Flagg,'' ``
Wonderful,'' ``Say, Darling'' and ``Gypsy,'' among others.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jule was a madman,'' Herscher recalled, ``the most wonderful
madman _ writing with one hand, producing with the other. I
remember him sweating over `You Gotta Have a Gimmick' in `Gypsy.'
They couldn't figure out what to do with those three ladies. And
one day he screamed out: `Come in here! I think this is gonna
work.'
</P>
<P>
   ``They were an odd couple, Jule and Steve Sondheim. Jule was so
ebullient, he couldn't put a sentence together. Steve just played
with words. Did they communicate at all? Yes. But it wasn't the
easiest thing.''
</P>
<P>
   She shook her head at the memory. ``I learned more up there in
that little office of Jule's over the Hellinger Theater. I learned
what makes a song work. What makes a scene work.''
</P>
<P>
   Did she always want to be in the theater? The question brought a
crooked smile. ``I wanted to be an actress,'' she confessed.
</P>
<P>
   Born Sylvia Kossovsky in New York to Eastern European immigrant
parents of modest means, she studied piano from the age of 5 and,
as Herscher remembered: ``I spent my life at Carnegie Hall. For me,
it was serious music and theater, concerts and Eva Le Gallienne's
Civic Rep. Not musical theater. Not at first.''
</P>
<P>
   She graduated from college in 1934, married in 1935 and worked
at a variety of jobs until 1941, including summers in the borscht
belt serving up theater at Rosenblatt's Hotel in Glen Wild, N.Y.
``That's when I started doing musicals,'' she said. ``Though I made
the guests listen to Eugene O'Neill, too, on Sunday nights _ all
his one-acters. They actually began to like it after a while.''
</P>
<P>
   She paused. ``I didn't decide I couldn't be an actress; it was
decided for me, if you know what I mean. Then I had a family _ two
children. My husband, Seymour, worked at the Bulova watch company,
he was Artie Bulova's assistant. When they were looking for
somebody to do publicity, Seymour interviewed a guy named Alexander
Cohen _ in 1942, I think _ and Alex was hired. Then Alex began to
produce. Seymour eventually left Bulova and joined Alex in 1959.
They were together until Seymour died, six years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Cohen, who died in April, gave Herscher her start. ``My parents
believed that every woman should have a career,'' she said. ``Once
my kids were born, I wanted to work again. Alex first gave me a job
doing publicity for a `King Lear' he was producing, with Louis
Calhern, in 1950. Then he and Jule Styne were going to do a show
called `Make a Wish' and Jule needed a secretary. Jule used to say
he got stuck with a secretary who could neither type nor take
dictation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Which was true. If you were a working woman in those days, you
could be maybe a doctor _ but the sciences came not trippingly into
my head, you see. Or you could teach _ and I knew I could never
teach. Or you could become a secretary. The way not to be a
secretary was to not learn how to type. And so I never did. Within
a few years I was Jule's general manager.''
</P>
<P>
   She was silent for a moment, a trim, tiny woman with
astonishingly alert eyes magnified by great enveloping spectacles.
``Jule and Alex had one thing in common,'' she announced, as if
realizing the fact herself for the first time. ``They were never
afraid to fail. They dusted themselves off and started all over
again. So different from today. Everything today is by committee.
Jule thought `Pal Joey' should go on, `Pal Joey' went on. We went
to a factoring company and he put all of his Ascap royalties as
collateral to get the balance of the money he needed to open that
show. If he believed in something he got it on. Alex was the same
way. Courage of your convictions _ go out and do.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1960, Herscher went out and joined William Morris. ``Jule
stopped producing,'' she said simply. ``The agency thought I might
represent performers, but it became very clear early on that my
strengths really were with writers. There were producers who were
interested in adapting a book; I would meet with them and find the
right playwright. Composers looking for a project to musicalize,
lyricists looking for a composer; whenever there was a situation
that needed a little something, they would throw me in there.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's how I met Jerry Herman. For whatever reason, there was
a problem with who should direct his first show, `Milk and Honey.'
I got involved and everything worked out very nicely. Jerry and I
met. And we realized that we were truly soul mates. I don't think a
week goes by still that we don't speak.''
</P>
<P>
   After five years, Herscher moved on to Edwin H. Morris, one of
Broadway's leading music publishers. ``Buddy Morris wanted to
become a producer, which is why I signed on,'' she said. ``But it
became very apparent that if you're publishing 8 or 10 top
composers and lyric writers, you can't choose to produce A and not
B.
</P>
<P>
   ``Still, it was a joy. So much talent: Harold Arlen. Charles
Strouse and Lee Adams. Jerry Herman. At Morris, a composer got
support _ financial and emotional. You made a commitment to what
you heard.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't always art,'' Herscher added. ``In 1965 I saw this
little show, `Man of La Mancha,' up at the Goodspeed Opera House in
Connecticut. And I didn't particularly like it. But I knew it was
going to make money. I said to Buddy, `Let's get ``Man of La
Mancha.'' ' And he said, `No.''' She shrugged. ``After that he
never said no to me again.''
</P>
<P>
   ```Grease,''' Herscher went on. `` `Grease' was not a great
show. I picked it up after hearing a runthrough downtown in the
East Village. I went and I had a good time. I thought, `This is
going to work.' I arranged for the entire office to go to the last
preview. And nobody would talk to me after that. They all hated it
with a passion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course,'' she added, ``they sure got over that.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``Ed Kleban,'' Herscher suddenly recalled. ``Ed left his job _
he'd been working in record producing _ and came to meet with me
and said, `I have a show I've written, music and lyrics.'
`Gallery,' it was called. I arranged for Michael Bennett to hear
the score. Michael wound up very impressed with the lyrics. He
asked Ed if he would mind coming downtown to see some of the
workshops he'd started with dancers and to meet this composer named
Marvin. And out of that came `A Chorus Line.' Which we published.''
</P>
<P>
   Herscher sighed. ``Soon after that, Buddy Morris sold the
company to his lawyer, John Eastman. You know, you end with `A
Chorus Line,' it's time to get out. I went to work as head of the
theater department at G. Schirmer. By the late '70s I saw things
were really changing. In 1982, I retired.''
</P>
<P>
   Which isn't to say that she stopped. ``I've just made a new
musical,'' Herscher practically crowed. ``It's called `Haunted.'
Steven Schoenberg did the music, Diane Seymour did the lyrics and
Marilyn Stasio did the book, based on an old Victorian novel. I put
them all together; they'd never met each other. Things are rippling
and rumbling. And I blackmail, I use every weapon in the book _
`How long do you think I have to live?,' I tell the producers.
`Let's get moving.'''
</P>
<P>
   She grew silent. ``This is the difference between theater then
and theater now. It's boring after a while to talk about. But you
could have so many new things going then because there were people
who were ready to take the chance. Now, unless you can show
somebody the bottom line, forget it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Money _ the importance of money _ has had a profound affect on
everything we do, so why not the theater, too? Of course, Jule and
Alex all expected to make money. But they also recognized that
failure was possible, too. And they went on their own gut. It was a
passion. And that's not what we have now. Now we have calculation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like to talk about it,'' Herscher said, ``because I
really start to cry.'' She actually did start crying, for just a
moment. ``I was involved in so many. Sometimes your heart broke,
but if this didn't work, the next did. Now _ what they consider
great (and I don't even know who `they' is), I just don't
understand. I try to remember a musical that left me feeling
something. I can't.''
</P>
<P>
   Her tone brightened: ``I listened to Audra McDonald's first
album'' _ ``Way Back to Paradise'' _ ``listened to it very
carefully, to all the new writers. And obviously they aren't
writing for me. But. If I could only work with some of those kids.
Because this is the talent of the age. I get so upset! Working is
hard now for everyone, but they have to understand that it's
working with the specific people that makes sense; that's what's
important. And it's so hard to find the projects that sing.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's where I can help,'' Herscher insisted adamantly. ``I
know what sings. Still.''

SHOWING OFF THE PROFUSE CULTURE OF BRAZIL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, June 4) 
 By LARRY ROHTER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAO PAULO, Brazil _ Nothing is ever done on a small scale here
in the largest city in Latin America's largest country. So when
cultural and business leaders gathered a few years back to plan how
to commemorate the 500th anniversary of the Portuguese colonization
of Brazil, it was preordained that they would want to make a bold,
sweeping statement about the state of the arts in Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, the dimensions of the mega-exhibition that opened here
in late April exceed all expectations. With nearly 15,000 objects
on display in 13 separate ``modules'' in four buildings that have a
combined area larger than the Louvre, ``The Rediscovery Show:
Brazil+500'' is, quite simply, the largest and most ambitious
display of Brazilian visual arts ever assembled.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not partisans here of the notion that less is more,''
Nelson Aguilar, the exhibition's chief curator, said dryly. As a
result, the exhibition, which has a $25 million budget, ranges from
the Stone Age to the 21st century, with lingering stops along the
way to examine and admire the fusion of European, African and
Amerindian components that is the main characteristic of Brazil's
complicated cultural mix.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things didn't start out that way, but we would find one
important piece, which would lead us to another, and before we knew
it, the project had taken on a life of its own,'' explained Edemar
Cid Ferreira, a prominent Sao Paulo banker who is president of the
exhibition's organizing committee. ``So what we ended up with is a
panorama of Brazil that says to both Brazilians and the rest of the
world that this country has a cultural density that few others can
match.''
</P>
<P>
   The section that may most surprise the average visitor is the
one devoted to what is designated as ``Popular Art.'' Brazilians
have often looked upon the folk and ``primitive'' art produced
around them with marked disdain, reserving their admiration for
more formal manifestations of high art, but this section of the
show, which is perhaps the largest, is likely to force a
reassessment.
</P>
<P>
   Wood engravings and earthenware figures from Pernambuco, carved
figureheads for boats sailing the Sao Francisco River, ex-votos
from the churches of the Northeast, papier mache masks from
carnival and folk festivals, even homemade rudimentary toys: All
have found their way into the exhibition, mounted with respect and
affection. The sheer volume and variety of the pieces is a powerful
demonstration of the remarkable fecundity of the popular
imagination.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to look at this art as something that is ours, ours
in the sense that it is not linked to any canon except our own,''
said Emanoel Araujo, the exhibition's curator. ``This is art that
comes from the very core of our being, and the objective is
precisely to show that these artists are profound in their own way,
that they are not beings from some other planet but from this
earth, expressing the strengths of this people.''
</P>
<P>
   Araujo is also the driving force behind ``Black in Body and
Soul,'' a unit that displays art both by and about blacks. It
includes objects that have little to do with Brazil _ photographs
by Robert Mapplethorpe, French colonial postcards of quotidian
scenes in West Africa in the 1930s _ as well as chains and other
``instruments of punishment'' from the days of slavery. But Araujo
said the message he wanted to convey was as much political as
aesthetic.
</P>
<P>
   ``The racial question is always one and the same, with the same
ancestry, no matter where in the black diaspora you happen to be,
and that is what this exhibit is addressing,'' he said. ``I want a
positive construction of the black image, so this is not an
exposition of Afro-Brazilian art, but an exposition about black
people and how they express themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   In an exhibition whose scope is so vast, the principal
underlying concepts are obviously diversity and variety. Yet it is
possible to discern some common threads that link apparently
unrelated works from different periods, such as, for example, the
glossy feathered cape of a Tupinamba Indian chief sent to Europe in
the 1630s and the ``Tupinamba Cloak,'' a mixed-media construction
created by Lygia Pape this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a sense of continuity in Brazilian art that is very
dramatic to me, and it has to do with humor and playfulness and a
sensuality that is expressed in rhythms that are visual as well as
musical,'' said Edward J. Sullivan, chairman of the Department of
Fine Arts at New York University and an expert on Brazilian art.
``High seriousness with an undercurrent of irony is a constant
feature of Brazilian art, literature, cinema and even music.''
</P>
<P>
   The distance Brazil has had to travel in creating its own
exuberant aesthetic is perhaps best demonstrated in the weakest of
the exhibitions, that devoted to the 19th century. The paintings
and sculptures displayed are frankly imitative of conventional
French salon art of the same period, with little to identify the
works as Brazilian except for the tropical landscape.
</P>
<P>
   Yet a module called ``The Distant View,'' which examines the
ways in which foreigners have portrayed Brazil, makes clear that
Brazil has also influenced Europe. The unit begins with the
landscapes painted by the Dutch artist Frans Post in the 1630s and
concludes with Anselm Kiefer's 1998 mixed-media series based on
photographs of the Sao Paulo skyline, with constant references
along the way to Brazil's extravagant flora and fauna and
resplendent natural light.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to make the exhibition attractive to a mass public
that does not ordinarily frequent museums, the organizers have
taken the unusual step of asking prominent stage designers from the
Brazilian theater to mount each section. That has led to a
startling diversity in ways of presenting works of art _ and to
most of the complaints about the exhibition, aside from the $5.75
admission fee, which some find too steep.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Indigenous Art'' section, for instance, is strikingly
simple and stark, with feather headdresses, masks, baskets and
fetishes suspended in glass cases with no further adornment and
sometimes even without a label, leaving the objects to speak for
themselves. The ``Baroque Art'' unit, in contrast, is a bizarre and
darkly lighted fantasy of purple and yellow paper flowers that
recalls nothing so much as the set of ``The Wizard of Oz'' and
never ceases to be distracting.
</P>
<P>
   To their credit, the organizers have also devoted a great deal
of attention to the exhibition's catalogs. There are a dozen of
them, totaling more than 3,000 pages, with gorgeous photographic
reproductions and thoughtful essays that explain, in both
Portuguese and English, the historical and social context in which
the artworks were produced and their creators lived.
</P>
<P>
   ``Taken as a whole, we envisioned these catalogs as a huge
encyclopedia, a vade mecum of Brazilian civilization,'' Ferreira
said. ``Brazil is a country that is not in the habit of looking
back, and so it never gets to know itself as it really is. We
wanted to remedy that both with the exhibition and the catalogs.''
</P>
<P>
   The catalogs are available in CD-ROM form as well, and some of
the works on display can also be viewed at a bilingual Web site
that will continue to function even after the show closes here on
Sept. 7: www.br500anos.com.br.
</P>
<P>
   After visits to other Brazilian cities later this year, parts of
the exhibition will begin a long overseas tour, including stops
next year in Washington and at the Museo del Barrio in New York
City.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the Guggenheim Museum will be selecting a few of
the works being shown here for a separate show that is to run from
Sept. 23, 2001, through Jan. 20, 2002. ``There will surely be some
overlap in terms of objects, but the two enterprises are completely
independent in terms of organization,'' said Lisa Dennison, the
Guggenheim's chief curator and deputy director. ``Our project is
highly selective, with probably 250 objects, and will focus on the
relationship between the Baroque and modernism.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Both of those periods are of course effectively represented in
the ``Rediscovery'' show, earning displays and catalogs of their
own. Modernist painters like Tarsila do Amaral and Anita Malfatti
and contemporary sculptors like Helio Oititica and Lygia Clark are
among the 20th-century standouts, while the Baroque module focuses
on polychrome woodcarvings and terra cotta works of 18th-century
masters like Aleijadinho and Francisco Xavier de Brito.
</P>
<P>
   This was one of the most extraordinary flowerings of painting,
sculpture, architecture and decorative arts ever seen in the
Americas, and very different from the Spanish sense of melancholy
you see in the Mexican or Peruvian art of this period,'' Sullivan
said. ``In general, it contains a sense of lightness and optimism
carried out in color and architectonic form that have a high degree
of theatricality, like constantly being involved in a rococo
opera.''
</P>
<P>
   It was an exhibition of modern art here in 1922 that set
Brazil's cultural agenda for the rest of the 20th century,
producing a manifesto arguing that the basis for all Brazilian
culture was a ``philosophy of anthropophagy,'' or appropriation,
amalgamation and regurgitation. With that concept now enshrined as
part of the national orthodoxy, ``The Rediscovery Show'' is making
a conscious effort to promote an updated agenda for the new
century.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we are doing is opening the doors and leaving them
open,'' Aguilar explained. ``By doing that, we can break taboos,
destroy myths and completely change the perspective that people
have of themselves. It is a scandal that an exhibition like this
was not mounted 20 or 40 years ago, but important that it is
finally being done now.''

   PHONE-CHARGES (Washington) _ The Federal Communications
Commission and most of the nation's leading telephone companies
announced Wednesday a sweeping reshuffling of the telephone rates
that should reduce costs for all businesses and consumers.
Officials said the reductions amounted to the largest rate cut in
the history of federal telephone regulation and that they would
have their biggest impact on the poor and those who use their
telephones the least. For tens of millions of Americans who make
few or no long distance calls each month, the government estimated
the rates would be reduced by as much as 50 percent. By Stephen

   EMAIL-POLITICS (Undated) _ Hour by hour the e-mails arrive like
digital daggers from the presidential candidates and their parties.
Catty, pithy, weighty, gossipy, they materialize via the open
cyberfaucet of the 2000 campaign. ``Bush's Million Mom
Manipulation,'' began a message from the Democrats. ``Democrat Fat
Cat Discriminates Against Those who Flee Castro's Clutches,'' read
an e-mail from the Republicans. ``New York Honor Guard Spat on at
Clinton Nomination,'' read another. Only by extension is the target

   INDIA-JUSTICE (Moradabad, India) _ If, as the adage goes,
justice delayed is justice denied, then India's courts can be said
to customarily live in a state of denial. Some 25 million cases are

unsatisfied aggrieved. By one expert's calculation, if no new
actions are filed, 324 years would be needed to clear the dockets.

ANALYSIS: AMERICA AND THE NEW EUROPE EYE AN UNCERTAIN FRIENDSHIP 
</HEADLINE>
   By ROGER COHEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN _ At his most recent meeting with Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright, the German foreign minister, Joschka Fischer,
was astonished to be presented with a diagram showing the American
view of Europe today.
</P>
<P>
   ``It showed circles intersecting with other circles that
intersected with still more circles in a rather bamboozling way,''
said Andreas Michelis, a Foreign Ministry spokesman. ``The American
question was: where do we turn among all these elements?''
</P>
<P>
   The circles in question represented national governments, the
European Union, the new office of Europe's high representative for
foreign and security affairs and other institutions. As President
Clinton starts a three-day visit to Berlin Thursday, they also
provide an apt image of the uncertain flux in the U.S. relationship
with Germany and its European partners.
</P>
<P>
   That an era has passed is clear. This is the first visit by the
U.S. president to Berlin since the government moved here from Bonn
and so brought down the final curtain on the decades of postwar
Allied tutelage of Germany. Less apparent, however, are the focus
and equilibrium of a relationship set adrift by the end of the Cold
War.
</P>
<P>
   At a recent meeting with a handful of correspondents here,
Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder complained that the United States
constantly pressed the ``new Germany'' to assume responsibilities
commensurate with its size, but whenever Germany raised its voice,
the old misgivings about German power reared their head once more.
</P>
<P>
   The chancellor was speaking in the aftermath of the debacle over
the choice of a new managing director for the International
Monetary Fund, an appointment pursued and won by Germany with a
bludgeoning vigor that shocked officials in Washington. But his
point was a broader one about the awkward transition in
trans-Atlantic relations.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration, under pressure from Congress, wants
Germany to do more _ send thousands of troops to Kosovo, increase
its defense spending, stimulate its big economy through
deregulation _ just as it wants several other European allies to
assume broader responsibilities.
</P>
<P>
   But when Germany and its European partners try to coordinate
that defense spending, develop their own military identity within
NATO through the formation of a 60,000 strong rapid-reaction corps,
and generally sketch a partial emancipation from U.S. strategic
dominance, Washington gets uneasy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The United States says it wants a clear phone number for a
Europe with some real cohesion,'' said Juergen Chrobog, the German
ambassador to the United States. ``But when we try to give it one,
we have problems.''
</P>
<P>
   A NATO diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
main U.S. concern was that the European Union's push to develop a
military capacity within NATO would multiply committees and
bureaucracy, increasing confusion but not effectiveness. ``And in
the end, if the European Union takes on its own collective defense,
you would have to ask what NATO is for,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   At the root of the U.S. unease lies the fact that, having
completed their economic union through the introduction of the
shared euro currency, Germany and its European allies have embarked
on a determined push for political and military integration.
</P>
<P>
   This European road is fraught and will certainly be long.
Britain is by no means the only place where resistance to further
integration exists. But Europeans have already done something that
now distinguishes the essence of their nationhood from that of the
United States: given up a huge slice of sovereignty by surrendering
control of the currency to a transnational European institution.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any major German interest now requires multilateral action,
whether it's the euro, or security concerns over Russia, where we
deal through the European Union and NATO,'' said Karl Kaiser, a
political scientist. ``But that is not the case in the United
States, and this can cause tension.''
</P>
<P>
   The most recent instance of such tension has arisen over U.S.
plans for a limited missile defense system that Germans see as a
doubtful defense against rogue states whose real menace is widely
questioned. Clinton sought to allay these concerns Wednesday by
saying the technology would be shared with ``other civilized
nations'' _ a reference to allies in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   But however this debate is handled, it has already illustrated
divergent views between the United States and a Europe increasingly
ready to speak with one voice on a strategic issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have an overwhelming superpower on the one hand and an
emerging Europe learning to articulate its interest on the other,''
said a close aide to Schroeder. ``That is the delicate
post-Cold-War equation we face.''
</P>
<P>
   The shifting nature of that equation is evident in the fact that
some people here have taken to saying that a more accurate name for
the new ``Berlin Republic'' would be the ``Brussels Republic.''
Brussels is the capital of the European Union.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have learned that the more we press our interests
multilaterally through Europe, the more we in Germany get for
ourselves,'' said Josef Joffe of the respected weekly Die Zeit.
``This will not change.''
</P>
<P>
   How far Germany will be able to combine this strategy with its
traditional role as chief European bridge to Washington is the
long-term question facing a country that still feels deeply
beholden to the United States for its post-war recovery.
</P>
<P>
   During his stay, Clinton will receive the International
Charlemagne Prize, presented annually to a person who has worked
for European unity. The choice of the president suggests the hope
that, despite much evidence to the contrary, America and European
nations have an identical interest in the forging of a United
States of Europe.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ ``I was wonderin' what it was like to be you.''
</P>
<P>
   Things are still more or less in control when these words are
spoken in the revival of Sam Shepard's ``True West,'' one of the
high points in the dizzyingly uneven Broadway season that just
ended. The spilled quarts of beer and sweat, the ransacked drawers,
the smashed furniture and the mutilated egos all lie ahead.
</P>
<P>
   But that simple sentence, uttered with gruff shyness by one
brother to another, is what really opens the doors to the ensuing
chaos. You have to be careful about wondering what it's like to be
someone else. It can take you into strange and slippery places.
Isn't it exhilarating?
</P>
<P>
   Imagining yourself into another existence, and then giving
physical life to those imaginings, is at the primal heart of drama.
It is what makes play-acting so incredibly glamorous to children,
and it is a large part of what keeps many of us hooked on live
theater. Much of literature may be fueled by this empathic leap of
the imagination. But what art form other than theater gives that
leap such unnerving immediacy, the sense of watching a circus
performer grabbing in midair for the trapeze?
</P>
<P>
   Books are consumed in the head, in a private dialogue between
writer and reader; movies, while often experienced communally, are
inevitably distanced by being confined to two dimensions. Theater,
taking place in the flesh in real time, is the most public and the
least lonely of the narrative arts.
</P>
<P>
   Even when it ponders the opacity of people, as it frequently
does these days, theater pulses with its vital human connection
with its audience. This may be one reason that the televised Tony
Awards ceremonies (this year's take place Sunday night) have
traditionally captured so little of what makes the theater
distinctive.
</P>
<P>
   But if the celebration that is the Tony Awards falls short of
embodying what it celebrates (and limiting itself to the parochial
professional village known as Broadway doesn't help matters), there
is much to toast in the first New York theater season to stretch
into a new century. The best offerings of the last year, at least
among nonmusical productions, reached with a heady suppleness of
both form and content to envision complete lives, to open human
minds for public display.
</P>
<P>
   The director Matthew Warchus' dynamic production of ``True
West,'' Shepard's portrait of diametrically different brothers who
unwittingly trade roles, took on a new Pirandello-like vividness
with its electric young stars, Philip Seymour Hoffman and John C.
Reilly, switching the two leads in alternating cycles of different
performances.
</P>
<P>
   To see either version is a thrill; to see both is to perceive
the very essence of the play _ which is, after all, about the
mutability of personality _ being both altered and confirmed by the
changed casting. You become newly aware of just how much an actor
is an author of any given production, and the degree to which a
play reinvents itself on a nightly basis.
</P>
<P>
   Uptown and down, the quest to peer into the consciousness of
others took varied and vigorous forms: from the avant-gardist
Richard Foreman's fragmented landscape of a philosopher's mind,
``Bad Boy Nietzsche!,'' to the director and playwright Moises
Kaufman's ``Laramie Project,'' in which a team of performers shaped
interviews surrounding the murder of a gay student in Wyoming into
a heartbreaking work of theatrical journalism.
</P>
<P>
   The best new plays to open on Broadway, Michael Frayn's
``Copenhagen'' and Claudia Shear's ``Dirty Blonde,'' summoned the
lingering presences of long-dead real-life figures _ the movie star
Mae West (``Dirty Blonde'') and the physicists Niels Bohr and
Werner Heisenberg (``Copenhagen'') _ to figure out what made them
run and how they shaped the world around them. They are
biographical mystery plays, in a sense, in which the dramatists
invite those watching to follow along as fellow detectives.
</P>
<P>
   Our feeling of being in on the process is achieved through the
actors, too. In ``Dirty Blonde,'' staged with an astonishing
fluidity by James Lapine, two characters, played by Shear and Kevin
Chamberlin, actually turn into Mae West. The transformations are
the engine of the play, a reflection of the characters' (and our)
hunger to understand West and, most ingeniously, a means of letting
us come to understand the characters.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, in ``Copenhagen,'' directed with canny precision by
Michael Blakemore, who had previously staged it in London, it's a
ravenous, frustrated curiosity that propels the drama, in which the
ghosts of Bohr, his wife and Heisenberg try to pin down exactly
what did happen during a tense World War II meeting among the three
characters.
</P>
<P>
   Philip Bosco, Blair Brown and Michael Cumpsty bring a contagious
fierceness to their characters' quests, and what is effectively a
shifting dance of subjective points of view, that keeps the evening
from drifting into the ether of abstraction. The implicit
watchwords of the evening are ones we have all said from time to
time: ``What were they thinking?'' ``Copenhagen'' makes the point
that even the participants themselves couldn't answer the question.
</P>
<P>
   A spirit of wonder at the opacity of people, even those you
think you know well, infuses this year's Pulitzer Prize winner for
drama. That's Donald Margulies' ``Dinner With Friends,'' and like
most recent Pulitzer winners, it is tellingly an Off Broadway
production.
</P>
<P>
   As familiar in its shape, dialogue and sensibility as an episode
of the television series ``thirtysomething,'' the play nonetheless
has a piercing emotional eloquence that speaks directly to the baby
boom audience that has made it a long-running hit. Given a
top-drawer production by Daniel Sullivan, ``Dinner With Friends''
paints a portrait of two 40-ish couples, best friends, who come to
realize they have never understood one another at all.
</P>
<P>
   It's a cold and isolating perception, yet the production
emanates a continual warmth, generated by the four actors' loving
embrace of characters who aren't always sympathetic. The fact that
it is a live drama, staged in an intimate theater, only strengthens
its connection with middle-aged audience members just beginning to
confront their own mortality.
</P>
<P>
   Sullivan, demonstrating a directorial versatility matched this
season by Blakemore (who is responsible for the triumphant revival
of ``Kiss Me, Kate'' as well as ``Copenhagen''), is also the man
behind the soul-stirring Broadway revival of Eugene O'Neill's
``Moon for the Misbegotten.'' The play itself is a deeply affecting
example of an artist reclaiming unhappy elements from his own life
and transforming them into something redemptive.
</P>
<P>
   ``A Moon for the Misbegotten'' was O'Neill's elegy for and
apology to his alcoholic brother James, whose character in the play
(also named James) is granted a moment of absolution and
unconditional love before dying. Yet most previous interpretations
have been dominated by the actress playing Josie, the strapping
farm girl who prompts James' cleansing confession. Though Josie is
here ably portrayed by no less a performer than Cherry Jones, it is
Gabriel Byrne's James that makes this production a milestone.
</P>
<P>
   Byrne has an emotional transparency that allows you to see
straight to the core of James' self-lacerating guilt and to realize
how it determines his every gesture. What you are witnessing is an
extraordinary collaboration between a dead dramatist and a living
actor, a convergence of wills to come to terms with and to redeem a
given character. Byrne, turning in the richest dramatic performance
of the season, gives ``A Moon for the Misbegotten'' back to James
Tyrone, and there is no understating the significance of that
accomplishment.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   A contemporary play from a young writer achieved its own
transcendent transformation of autobiography. Kenneth Lonergan's
``Waverly Gallery,'' seen Off Broadway at the Promenade Theater,
was inspired by the last years of his grandmother, an enduringly
strong-willed woman sliding into dementia. The resulting work is
both harrowing and funny, suggesting how much Beckett's absurdity
is rooted in real life.
</P>
<P>
   What took the play to another level, however, was Eileen
Heckart, the fabled octogenarian actress. Playing the grandmother,
Heckart rendered senility with such limpid sharpness that even as
you lamented the character's decline, you cheered the performer's
triumph. A crystalline order emerged from the muddle that is life.
Watching Heckart serve as its chief architect, in what she has said
will be her last stage performance, was a kind of transporting
privilege that only the theater affords.
</P>
<P>
   Other productions played directly and appealingly with a
self-conscious awareness of just what the theater achieves and how
it does it. The sparkling Broadway revival of ``The Real Thing,''
Tom Stoppard's keen-witted tale of a playwright in love, makes the
case that certain things (love, for example) defy articulation.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, with the infinitely charming Stephen Dillane
playing the playwright in this import from London, even groping in
the dark acquires a glistening stylishness that is pure theater.
Dillane's co-star, the radiant Jennifer Ehle, is, by the way, the
daughter of an actress who gave another sublime study this season
in stage-savvy artifice.
</P>
<P>
   That's Rosemary Harris, whose portrayal of a great lady of the
British stage exiled to a retirement home was the touchstone of
``Waiting in the Wings,'' a 40-year-old play by Noel Coward that
received its Broadway debut only this season. Harris slyly plied,
and gently sent up, the tricks of her trade to conjure a vanished
era of stagecraft, turning them into the tools by which her
character dominated her fellow residents. There is after all, it
seems, a practical use for the skills acquired on stage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Waiting in the Wings'' provided the additional pleasure of
presenting a host of actresses on the far side of 60, from Lauren
Bacall to Helen Stenborg, working as a team with contagious
delight. But the laurels for ensemble acting this season
unquestionably go to the cast of August Wilson's ``Jitney.''
</P>
<P>
   This reworking of an early play by the author of contemporary
masterpieces like ``Joe Turner's Come and Gone'' and ``Ma Rainey's
Black Bottom'' presented a slice of life, from the streets of
Pittsburgh in the 1970s, so invigoratingly fresh that you somehow
felt you had lived it yourself.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the cast members, directed by Marion McClinton, had been
together through earlier incarnations of the play, and they wore
their roles with a deceptively easy-looking assurance. By the end
of the performance, you had the sense that you had been listening
to these people regularly for most of your life. You left the
theater with the heartening illusion that it really is possible to
know people thoroughly, after all.
</P>
<P>
   In what is becoming a dispiriting tradition, musicals did not
begin to match their nonsinging siblings in moments of revelation,
with the merciful exceptions of two envelope-pushers: ``Contact''
and ``James Joyce's `The Dead.''' The season had one glorious
pinnacle of a revival, Cole Porter's backstage musical ``Kiss Me,
Kate,'' and a charming if imbalanced new version of Meredith
Willson's all-American ``Music Man,'' courtesy of the director and
choreographer Susan Stroman.
</P>
<P>
   Less encouragingly, the trend of reinventing, and usually
flattening, movie musicals for the stage _ which seemed to have
reached a nadir with the sterile ``Footloose'' _ scraped even
deeper with the mechanical interpretation of ``Saturday Night
Fever,'' which managed to erase every vestige of sensuality and
period authenticity from the film that inspired it.
</P>
<P>
   An original musical from Disney, Elton John and Tim Rice's
``Aida,'' somehow felt as if it, too, had been translated from the
screen _ in this case, from a Disney cartoon _ though it did have
the virtue of establishing the incandescent Heather Headley, in the
title role, as a bona fide Broadway star.
</P>
<P>
   More ambitious, and hence ultimately more disappointing, were
two separate productions that adapted ``The Wild Party,'' Joseph
Moncure March's cult poem of the Jazz Age, as musicals: Andrew
Lippa's version for the Manhattan Theater Club and the current
Broadway incarnation by George C. Wolfe and the composer Michael
John LaChiusa (the latter also represented this season by the
overweening ``Marie Christine'' at Lincoln Center).
</P>
<P>
   Following a battalion of self-destructive sybarites through one
evening of dubious pleasures, both shows suffered from feelings of
arrested development. The notes of shrill unhappiness and brooding
restlessness were struck early and held for the musicals'
remainders, imprisoning their characters and scores in a frieze of
decorative decadence that never became fully animated.
</P>
<P>
   There were, however, two productions that bravely and
successfully staked out new territory for the musical: Stroman's
``Contact'' at Lincoln Center and ``James Joyce's `The Dead,''' by
Richard Nelson and Shaun Davey, which transferred to Broadway from
Playwrights Horizons. The slew of Tony nominations heaped upon
``Contact'' has caused some grumbling in the New York theater,
since the show is a dance play, with minimal dialogue and no
original music.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, its three vignettes blissfully capture what
has always been most seductive about the American musical: its
ability to lift off from everyday reality into a music-driven
empyrean, while pulling its audiences skyward with it. Boyd Gaines'
portrayal in the evening's final scene, of a suicidal urbanite who
finds his feet and his heart by learning to dance, became the
perfect metaphor for the audience's implicit participation in the
show.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Dead,'' though less flashy, was even more innovative: a
musical that dared to be quiet. In retelling Joyce's great story of
mortal shadows at a Christmas party in Dublin, the show presented a
group of people who appeared to be performing for one another
rather for than the audience. The responses of those onstage became
as important as those who were singing or dancing for them, and a
whole other level of naturalistic character definition was
introduced to the musical form.
</P>
<P>
   No musical season in New York will ever be entirely barren as
long as the ``Encores!'' series of American musicals in concert
continues to flourish at City Center. This year the program's peak
was its final offering, a heavenly resurrection of a
never-never-land, an idealized New York City of the 1950's, in
``Wonderful Town.''
</P>
<P>
   Overseen by the prodigiously gifted Kathleen Marshall, also the
choreographer on ``Kiss Me, Kate,'' the evening provided myriad
pleasures but none quite so astonishing as those offered by its
star, the two-time Tony winner Donna Murphy. Hitherto most notable
as a performer of somber emotional intensity (``Passion,'' ``The
King and I''), Murphy turned her image on its head with a dazzling,
razor-sharp comic performance.
</P>
<P>
   Which further confirms that really good theater artists are an
enviable lot. They can, after all, turn into anyone.

<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. _ Arthur Everett Austin Jr., or Chick, as he was
known from childhood, managed to have the last word on himself, by
getting the first one in.
</P>
<P>
   ``The house is just like me,'' he told critics and admirers of
the 86-foot-wide, one-room-deep, painted-wood Palladian villa with
the Venetian baroque and International style interiors. ``All
facade.''
</P>
<P>
   Austin, director of the Wadsworth Atheneum, built the striking
house here on staid Scarborough Street in 1930 at age 29.
</P>
<P>
   After 20 months and half a million dollars of cosmetic labor,
the ``pasteboard palace,'' as local grandees dubbed it, will greet
Hartford society again. The Atheneum, which now owns the Austin
house and has restored it, will unveil it to trustees June 8,
appropriately, at a party. A National Historic Landmark, it may
eventually be on view by appointment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I talked to the son of the man who lived across the street
when Chick was building the house, who was one of the founders of
the august Hartford law firm Robinson &AMP; Cole,'' said Eugene R.
Gaddis, the curator of the Austin house and author of ``Magician of
the Modern,'' a biography of Austin to be published by Alfred A.
Knopf in the fall. ``The son was in his mid-70s. `What did your
father think of the house?' I asked, and he said, `An excrescence.'
I said: `Oh, well, that's very interesting. And what do you think
of it, after all these years?' `An excrescence,' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `Oh, well, that's very interesting. And what do you
think of it, after all these years?' `An excrescence,' he said.''
</P>
<P>
   But Philip Johnson, who was introduced to Austin in the 1920s by
Henry-Russell Hitchcock, the architectural historian, called the
house more important now than even its designer could have
understood.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course none of us could stand his house, heavens no,''
Johnson recalled in Gaddis' biography. ``The least we could do was
copy Gropius. Today, every architect that I know under 45 wouldn't
think of building a house without going through his books of
Palladio first. And there it sits on Scarborough Street. A
postmodern house, if you please.''
</P>
<P>
   Behind Austin's legendary chain-smoking, cocktail-swilling,
brilliantined matinee-idol facade was the work of a serious
avant-gardist.
</P>
<P>
   As the director from 1927 to 1945 of the Atheneum, America's
oldest public art museum (established by Daniel Wadsworth in 1842),
Austin mounted the first comprehensive Picasso exhibition in the
United States. The evening the show opened, guests like Alexander
Calder, Isamu Noguchi, Buckminster Fuller and Clare Booth Luce sat
for the world premiere of Gertrude Stein and Virgil Thomson's first
opera, ``Four Saints in Three Acts,'' in the theater of a
Bauhaus-inspired building that was Austin's newest, personally
designed addition to the museum, the Avery Memorial.
</P>
<P>
   The young director also staged the country's first Surrealist
exhibition, featuring a Spaniard named Salvador Dali with a
painting called ``Persistence of Memory.'' With a Harvard friend,
Lincoln Kirstein, Austin sponsored the immigration of a dancer and
choreographer named George Balanchine and gave his new company its
first public appearance in America. At the Atheneum, he ran the
first film retrospective at a museum. ``The Art of the Motion
Picture'' opened with Fritz Lang's ``Metropolis.''
</P>
<P>
   Behind the facade of the Modernist was an old-world connoisseur
of painting and sculpture, a curator and a collector. With his
parents, Austin had been making trips to Europe since he was 3. He
had lived in Dresden and Paris. He had studied with Bernard
Berenson. Austin's exhibition of Italian Baroque art in 1934 is
credited by scholars with rediscovering a period that had been
dismissed for 100 years.
</P>
<P>
   And behind his academic facade was a bisexual adventurer who
married a local socialite, Helen Goodwin, who happened to be the
niece of the Atheneum's board president, had two children,
sporadically pursued a second career in Hollywood away from his
family, and was fired by the museum in 1945 in part because of
uncovered financial chaos. For his next and last act, he brought a
Florida circus millionaire's museum to international prominence,
then died at home in Hartford in 1957, at 57, of an inoperable
tumor, having abandoned his male lover of 10 years to return to his
wife.
</P>
<P>
   Austin claimed he saw an angel before he slipped into a coma. No
one knows whether it was shaking its head.
</P>
<P>
   Behind the pilastered facade on Scarborough Street, he had
nothing to hide. Austin liked to show his house, bringing the
curtain up with a flourish on its stagelike, set-piece rooms. A
devotee of drama who designed several theaters and play
productions, including ``Medea'' in 1934, directed by John
Houseman, translated by the Harlem poet Countee Cullen and
choreographed by Martha Graham, Austin also appeared in Hartford as
Hamlet, challenging the loyalty of even good friends.
</P>
<P>
   The two-story, 18-foot-deep house involved every aspect of the
dilettante's interests, training and talents (he called himself an
``amateur,'' in the 18th-century sense), including a gift for
magic. Austin toured publicly as the Great Osram, a name taken from
the German light fixtures used in his new Bauhaus-inspired
bathrooms.
</P>
<P>
   The house's exterior was based on the Villa Ferreti in Dolo,
Italy, built in 1596 by Vincenzo Scamozzi, a student (later a
rival) of Andrea Palladio. The Austins saw it on their honeymoon.
</P>
<P>
   The interiors were an artistic showman's display of his two
great aesthetic loves: the Baroque and the Modern. ``Part of being
a Modernist, in Chick's view, was rediscovering the past,'' Gaddis
said on a recent visit, standing in the imitation Baroque dining
room, the walls of which are covered in a blue-green brocatelle
silk recreated by Scalamandre from scraps of the original that the
Austins bought in Venice. ``It created a dramatic world for his own
very Modernist existence. You go from this very 18th-century
atmosphere downstairs to the very edge of design in the Bauhaus,
upstairs. For Chick, all art was contemporary. If you understood
how it was created and why it was created, it was alive.''
</P>
<P>
   The house cost $43,000 to build. Austin's adoring mother, Laura,
paid for it. She spent her life constructing an elaborate genealogy
to prove that she and her son were royalty. After four years of
dunning letters from Adolf Loewi, his Venetian antiques dealer, for
a payment of $15,000, which was four times Austin's salary, the
furnishing bills were sent to her, too.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The house is a precociously educated pastiche. In addition to
studying with Berenson in Italy, Austin was also a student of
Federigo Ioni, a notorious restorer who was also reputed to be a
forger, copying 15th-century pictures as exercises.
</P>
<P>
   In the dining room, the carved cobweb-like boiserie that frames
the serving niche is in fact a Bavarian bed alcove. The grand
doorway that leads into the living room is taken from a massive
armoire. The harbor tableaux of fantastic voyages with pantalooned
buccaneers that form its views are the output of ``a third-rate
journeyman simulating a painting by Claude Lorrain, which hangs in
the Louvre,'' Gaddis said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's more or less wallpaper,'' he explained. ``Chick started
to enlarge the boat in one panel, then gave up on it. So you see,
this is not the grand Newport kind of a finished palace. It's
Chick's stage set. Many things are not of the highest quality, but
he didn't care. He wanted the aura.''
</P>
<P>
   He was also, in the tradition of the theater and the studio
arts, a do-it-yourselfer.
</P>
<P>
   There were only four walls for the five 18th-century Italian
chinoiserie painted-silk panels in the music room. Austin installed
the extra one on the ceiling. In 1935, Virgil Thomson, Aaron
Copland, Paul Bowles and George Antheil sat here and played at the
piano until 4 in the morning.
</P>
<P>
   Austin marbleized and trompe-l'oeiled steps, mirror frames and
door surrounds. He mixed the house's 56 interior colors himself.
``That's the extraordinary thing,'' Gaddis said, ``the fact that
you have this house from a great connoisseur of fine arts that was
created by him personally.'' Austin was an assistant to Edward
Forbes, the director of the the Fogg Art Museum in Cambridge,
Mass., for three years before Forbes recommended the young man for
the job in Hartford.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was trained in the methods and processes of Italian
Renaissance painting,'' Gaddis said, ``and he knew how colors were
created and what they did, from an artist's point of view. This
house was a painting to him.''
</P>
<P>
   Krystyn Hastings-Silver, the project manager for the
restoration, said that when carpeting was pulled up for
replacement, ``the floors looked like Jackson Pollocks _ he mixed
the colors for each room right there in the room.'' Colors were
frequently pulled from artwork: the living room's dark green copies
the storm-clouded skies in the 18th-century harbor scenes.
</P>
<P>
   Hastings-Silver also found valuable wall fabric samples, which
she used to match for color with replicas, under baseboards that
Austin had tacked on.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could follow the line of his scissors as he cut along the
wall,'' she said. ``A professional tradesman wouldn't have left
this kind of evidence.''
</P>
<P>
   Because of its conceit as a backdrop, the uneven quality of its
furniture and Austin's attention to decoration, the house's
backgrounds were treated as its most important historical elements,
from the rose silk taffeta draperies in the living room to the flat
planes of paint in Helen Austin's dressing room and bathroom
upstairs, which were based on Walter Gropius' bathroom at the
Bauhaus in Dessau. In it, each section of every wall is coordinated
by color to its exposure: east-facing surfaces are beige, west are
blue, north are cream and south are a deep cocoa brown.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was the first room the painters did,'' Hastings-Silver
said of her team, which included more than 30 trades, ``and we're
so glad they didn't quit.''
</P>
<P>
   The house was given to the Atheneum by the Austin family in
1985, when Helen Austin, then in ill health, moved out. With a
bequest from her cousin, Genevieve Harlow Goodwin, the museum
started its investigations of the house, ``a place of odd
enchantments,'' as Gaddis describes it.
</P>
<P>
   Brought back, waiting for its next role, it seems more a
restoration of a remarkable spirit, with remarkable taste and a
remarkable irresponsibility to the truth, than the reconstruction
of historic rooms in an architecturally significant building.
</P>
<P>
   Fired pink and gold by late afternoon sunlight, the Austin house
showed what it knew of its creator: every incautious corner of it
grew warm with seduction, never missing a trick.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ The paying guests are about to arrive, and Michael
Henry Adams, a Harlem private-tour impresario, is bustling around
his apartment, lighting candles atop a fireplace mantel and laying
out tea in a porcelain pot and smoked salmon on a silver-plated
platter.
</P>
<P>
   His own basement apartment, assembled since March but looking as
if it had been that way since the Harlem Renaissance, leads off his
$100 tour, which, on any given night, might include St. Nick's Pub
or the Lenox Lounge. Most tours benefit some group. Who benefits
from this one? ``Me,'' Adams said.
</P>
<P>
   He is certainly qualified to lead a tour: this spring, he taught
a course called ``The Harlem Community'' at City College. At the
end of the year, Monacelli Press is bringing out his architectural
compendium, ``Harlem: Lost and Found: 1765-1915.''
</P>
<P>
   Adams once wanted to be an interior designer; his last
apartment, a tiny studio room in Hamilton Heights, was featured in
a book on New York style. His current three-room apartment on 122nd
Street off Lenox Avenue (which he rents for $800 a month) is an
exotic tossed salad, with Louis XVI and a crystal chandelier mixed
up with street finds. His front room is an intimate parlor. There
is no bedroom; his daybed sits in a niche on one wall in the back
room.
</P>
<P>
   Adams is an avid preservationist, and his apartment is a prism
through which the tourist can glimpse bits and pieces of Harlem
past.
</P>
<P>
   Over his bed, for instance, is a galvanized tin frieze. ``It
came from the Marion Building at the corner of 125th Street and
Lenox _ ripped out and thrown into a Dumpster,'' he said. Over his
fireplace hangs a gilded garland, part of the demolished interior
of the Audubon Theater, where Malcolm X was assassinated.
</P>
<P>
   His decorating with Harlem's lost-and-found objects makes sense.
When he was 13, his father scoffed at his ambition to be an
interior designer, telling him, ``Only white people hire interior
designers.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1974, he went to the Addingham Summer School in England, and
eventually studied historic preservation for two years at Columbia
University. He gave up becoming an interior designer: too many
people told him his father was right.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, meanwhile, Adams developed a passion for
preservation that some find abrasive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why would you say abrasive?'' he asked. ``I'd rather you say
`confrontational.'''
</P>
<P>
   He is most confrontational when demanding landmark status for
large chunks of Harlem. Usually, he speaks in a deliberate, low
voice. But his voice rises when he talks about the historic
buildings that have come down, and are coming down, in Harlem.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Abyssinian Baptist Church is trying to turn Small's
Paradise _ the only one of the three major jazz clubs, and the only
one owned by a black man _ into an International House of
Pancakes,'' he said. ``Would they turn the Stork Club into an
International House of Pancakes?'' (Karen Phillips, president of
the church's development corporation, confirmed that negotiations
with the pancake chain are under way.)
</P>
<P>
   The best way to protect such unofficial landmarks, Adams said,
is to incorporate them into a series of historic districts, and
until that happens, he will continue to protest.
</P>
<P>
   Although the city landmarks commission has designated the Hotel
Teresa, the Mother Zion AME Church, the Abyssinian Baptist Church,
Wadleigh High School and dozens of other Harlem buildings during
the last decade, Adams contends that thousands more need
protection, among them the newly restored Lenox Lounge, the
Renaissance Casino, Blumstein's Department Store and 321 Edgecombe
Avenue, where the Mills Brothers and the Nicholas Brothers lived.
``Almost all of Greenwich Village, much of the Upper East Side and
Upper West Side and most of Park Slope and Brooklyn Heights are
landmarked,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A commission spokeswoman, Terri Rosen Deutsch, rejected Adams'
criticisms. The current commission, she said, has done more in
Harlem in the last five years than any other commission.
</P>
<P>
   Adams said that after the panel voted to protect some buildings
_ but not to create an entirely new district _ one commissioner
asked if he was grateful. He says he is far from grateful. To prove
it, he chained himself to the doors of commission headquarters in
Manhattan last year. He spent a night in jail.
</P>
<P>
   Some preservationists may be wary of Adams because of such
stunts, but Anthony C. Wood, chairman emeritus of New York City's
Historic Districts Council, says his voice is an important one in
Harlem preservation. ``You can question the wisdom of his tactics,
but you can't question his dedication,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Is Adams an outright zealot, or just zealous?
</P>
<P>
   ``In our culture, to call someone a zealot is pejorative, but to
call someone zealous is not,'' he replied. ``All I want is for
Harlem to have the same degree of protection that the other
historic neighborhoods have.''

CARLY SIMON LATEST IS A TOUCHING, MOVING LOVE LETTER
</HEADLINE>
 By BILL DEAN   
 The Ledger, Lakeland, Fla.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAKELAND, Fla. _ In the comparatively carefree 1970s, when Carly
Simon was forging a career as a pop-queen and a singer/songwriter,
she once sang, ``I haven't got time for the pain.''
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1990s, however, the pain caught up with her: Simon
developed breast cancer and underwent surgery.
</P>
<P>
   But her return to health, and music, is marked by her first
recording of new material in six years.
</P>
<P>
   She called it ``The Bedroom Tapes'' for what turned out to be
obvious reasons: Virtually the entire album was written (and some
of it performed and recorded) in the bedroom of her home on
Martha's Vineyard.
</P>
<P>
   If music is indeed therapy, then Simon, 54, deserves praise as
the Dr. Jonas Salk poster girl of rhyme and reinstatement, because
``The Bedroom Tapes'' is impressive on several levels.
</P>
<P>
   It's a touching and moving love letter to listeners everywhere
of what can be accomplished in the darkest of hours. And it's proof
that Simon (the winner of the 1971 Grammy for best new artist)
hasn't lost her punch. Lyrically, her pen is heartbreakingly honest
and biting when required. And when her melodies match that
intensity, the results are nothing short of breathtaking.
</P>
<P>
   ``So Many Stars'' offers the virtue of hindsight when
reassessing a former love and pondering its premature death while
gazing at the stars over Manhattan. It is plaintively poignant but
buoyed by intriguing vocal lines and keyboards. It serves as a
winning platform for Simon's little-heard falsetto.
</P>
<P>
   In the especially heart-moving ``Scar,'' her illness is
presented as less of a threat to her as it is to the approach of
those around her. ``It's after the knives and the sutures and
needles, I'm left with an arrow that points at my heart,'' Simon
sings.
</P>
<P>
   Some are blatantly callous: ``A man I knew once said he wanted
to see me. I said I'd been sick but was on the mend. I told him a
few of the overall details. He said `That's too bad' and never
called again.''
</P>
<P>
   But another voice, perhaps Simon's own, offers appropriate
encouragement: ``And the night is cold as the coldest nights are.
There's a wise woman, she comes from an evening star. She says
`Look for the signs, you won't have to look far; lead with your
spirit and follow your scar.''' Whew. You should be sitting down
when you hear that one.
</P>
<P>
   Simon's songwriting breadth expands in disparate directions on
such songs as ``Big Dumb Guy'' and ``We Your Dearest Friends.''
</P>
<P>
   The former, with a slightly contemporary country sound, is
teasing and tongue-in-cheek in its takes on prospective suitors.
``Cyberman lights up, but mostly he's floppy. Computer man crashes,
he's so humpty-dumpty,'' she smiles.
</P>
<P>
   And on the latter tune, a scathing answer to former friends (and
perhaps lovers), Simon pulls out all her sarcastic stops.
</P>
<P>
   ``We, your dearest friends are having dinner without you...in
just another minute we'll be laughing about you,'' she sings.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're witty, and we use it to be vicious...to the untrained
eye, it wouldn't look suspicious.''
</P>
<P>
   Melodically, the music on ``The Bedroom Tapes'' rarely tumbles
except on ``Our Affair,'' an unfortunate choice to open the album
since the melody of its verses echo Simon's 1972 hit ``You're So
Vain,'' while the choruses sag with boring sameness.
</P>
<P>
   Others, like ``Cross the River'' and ``I'm Really the Kind,''
benefit from funky piano and Beatlesque harmonies, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   But don't expect hit singles. ``The Bedroom Tapes'' is not about
individual, or commercial, contrivances. It's more about overall,
and singularly inclusive, achievement in the face of long odds.

 &HT;    Oh, the sudden joy of cooking with soy!
 &HT;    By Kitty Crider
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Three magic words in the new millennium: Deborah
Madison and tofu. This popular vegetarian author's cooking class on
tofu sold out recently at Central Market. When the waiting list
grew to 50 names, Madison added another class.
</P>
<P>
   Austin may have always had some tofu tendencies, but this is a
first on the solid soy scene.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have been unable to make the minimum _ let alone sell out a
tofu class _ in the past three years,'' says cooking school
director Cathy Cochran-Lewis. But now soy's hot. And the
award-winning Madison, who lives in Santa Fe, N.M., has a new book,
``This Can't Be Tofu'' (Broadway, $15). Talk about timing!
</P>
<P>
   TEA OR MILK
</P>
<P>
   Nope, the cows haven't gone dry. But Promised Land Dairy, that
Floresville plant that puts milk in real glass bottles, has gotten
into the tea business. Texas Teas _ found in the refrigerated case
at local groceries _ come in 16-ounce bottles in four flavors,
including green tea with ginseng.
</P>
<P>
   It's a refrigerated product with a 45-day shelf life because it
does not contain citric acid like many shelf-stable drinks. ``We
wanted to get something that tastes close to fresh-brewed,'' says
Gordon Kuenemann, senior VP.
</P>
<P>
   Promised Land is still in the bottled milk biz, but a lot of
dairies are getting into all kinds of drinks to make things
profitable, Kuenemann says. And brewing tea has got to be a lot
easier and cheaper than milking cows.
</P>
<P>
   Now, if consumers can just remember to keep those tea bottles in
the fridge.
</P>
<P>
   FLOUR POWER
</P>
<P>
   The architect was flying back to Austin when a fellow
first-class passenger asked if that was a sack of flour at his
feet. Sure was, the architect acknowledged. But not just any flour.
White Lily, a soft wheat flour that many experts think makes the
best biscuits, shortcake, scones . . .
</P>
<P>
   It's a basic ingredient that is found everywhere in the South,
from Florida to Tennessee. But it's rarer in Austin than sushi in
Amarillo. However, Austinites who have been hauling those bags of
flour in their carry-on luggage need to know that it is now
available at Williams-Sonoma, where a 2-pound bag of the
self-rising variety goes for $2.
</P>
<P>
   FLYING HIGH WITH FAT
</P>
<P>
   eFit.com says an airline flier is worse off eating the food on
the plane than a McDonald's Big Mac, french fries and a strawberry
sundae. eFit, which is an online health and fitness network,
conducted a survey of first-class and coach meals from 15 airlines,
and found that a single airline meal contains 1,000 to 1,200
calories, 50 to 60 grams of fat and 2,000 mg of sodium. Daily
Reference Values established by the Food and Drug Administration
say that an average person should consume no more than 2,000
calories, 65 grams of fat and 2,400 mg of sodium each day.

<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Patrick Ewing. Can't live without him. Can't live
with him.
</P>
<P>
   The truth is, the New York Knicks are better off without Ewing
in the lineup. But that's not the whole truth. The Knicks
desperately need Ewing to have any hope of being the last team
limping at the end of the NBA playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   No, feeling strongly both ways isn't a copout. No, it's not a
sign of schizophrenia triggered by the sight of the Knicks dropping
a bunch of three-bombs on the Indiana Pacers in the Eastern
Conference finals.
</P>
<P>
   The NBA playoffs are a prolonged series of games of
rock-scissors-paper. One team's patsy is another team's poison.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to playing the Pacers, Ewing is more of a
hindrance than a help. Ewing is too old a warrior to teach the new
trick of getting out of the way enough for his sprightlier
teammates to attack at the Pacers' must vulnerable points.
</P>
<P>
   At first blush, the notion of the Knicks being better off
without a member of the NBA's Greatest 50 Team is as preposterous
as Larry Johnson becoming the president of Planned Parenthood.
</P>
<P>
   ``Asinine,'' Knicks coach Jeff Van Gundy insists.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, coaches aren't in the habit of publicly floating
the notion that the absence of an 11-time all-star could be
addition by subtraction. For another, Ewing is the player most
responsible for allowing Van Gundy to establish himself as an NBA
head coach. Van Gundy has returned the favor with fierce loyalty.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, the Knicks functioning better without Ewing means that
the whole is less than the sum of the parts. That's an indictment
of everybody involved. Ewing, for his inability to lift the play of
his teammates. The teammates, for not figuring out how to
effectively assert themselves when Ewing is on the court. Van
Gundy, for not fully meshing the talents of Ewing with the other
players.
</P>
<P>
   Wherever and in whatever proportions the blame rests, the Knicks
lost Games 1 and 2 with Ewing in the starting lineup. Ewing sat out
Games 3 and 4 with tendinitis in his right foot. The Knicks won.
His status the rest of the series is uncertain.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at the percentages with or without him,'' Pacers
center Rik Smits said, ``I guess I hope he comes back.''
</P>
<P>
   With Ewing, Van Gundy pulls in the reins on the Knicks. You have
to wonder: If Van Gundy had turned the Knicks loose once in a
while, could they have made shorter work of the Miami Heat in the
previous series? As it was, the Knicks averaged 81.1 points and
shot 40.4 percent against the Heat.
</P>
<P>
   The shackles _ and Ewing _ were gone the previous two games.
Latrell Sprewell and Allan Houston played free and easy in Game 3,
combining for 60 points. Johnson had a 25-point breakout
performance in Game 4, and there was still room for Kurt Thomas (16
points) and Charlie Ward (16 points) to breathe. The Knicks
averaged 94.5 points in the two games, shooting 51 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Without Ewing. With Sprewell nursing a fracture in his left
foot. With Marcus Camby hobbled by a sprained right knee.
</P>
<P>
   ``No matter who played wasn't nearly as important as how we
played,'' Van Gundy argued. ``We play well when we share the ball
and we play inside-out.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, Ewing never has been one who shared well. Sure, he's
averaging a respectable 14.4 points and 9.5 rebounds this
postseason. He's also shooting only 43 percent from the field,
averaging an assist every 98.5 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks have a sleeker, surer look about them lately. The
10-of-14 3-point shooting in Game 4 wasn't as flukey as it sounds.
The Knicks kept slicing through the Pacers' defense and getting
ridiculously open looks at the basket.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're a slow team,'' Pacers forward Jalen Rose said. ``We're
not an athletic team.''
</P>
<P>
   Just as clearly, the Pacers are no match for the Knicks when it
comes to steely resolve. Damning Pacers quote No. 1, from forward
Dale Davis: ``We're still in the driver's seat. We just have to
come out and play harder.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, what have the Pacers been waiting for, what with a spot in
the NBA Finals at stake? Damning Pacers quote No. 2, from guard
Reggie Miller: ``It is very frustrating. We felt we could come in
here, get one, possibly two.''
</P>
<P>
   A team with a champion's mentality doesn't think about
``possibly'' coming into Madison Square Garden and winning two
against the ailing Knicks. A team with a champion's mentality comes
into Madison Square Garden expecting to kick the Knicks while
they're down.
</P>
<P>
   No, the Knicks don't need Ewing now, against these Pacers. They
sure could have used him in last year's Finals against the San
Antonio Spurs' 7-footers, Tim Duncan and David Robinson.
</P>
<P>
   Down the road, where Shaquille O'Neal and the Los Angeles Lakers
lurk, the Knicks will be grateful to have Ewing on their side. If
his achy, breaking body isn't beyond repair by then. The sight of
Chris Dudley, Camby, Thomas and Johnson trying to guard The Big
Aristotle is for mature audiences only.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Ewing. Can't live without him. Can't always live with
him.

BUILDING A NEW CONSERVATORY THE AMERICAN WAY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Ohio, Texas, Mo., Japan, Germany ,  Turkey and China.)   (For release Sunday, June 4)  
 By DAVID SCHOENBAUM   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CINCINNATI _ Between his sensational debut in 1781 and his
premature death in 1805, among the stack of plays, verses and
histories that he produced, the German writer Friedrich Schiller
also found time to think about the link between arts education and
civic education. For Schiller the connection was obvious.
</P>
<P>
   Although some of his contemporaries thought so, too, including
Thomas Jefferson, the well-known architect, prose stylist and
amateur violinist, the connection has never been obvious to the
U.S. Congress, most state legislatures or countless school boards.
But Americans have never entirely dismissed it, either.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Schiller's ``On the Aesthetic Education of Man'' is tough
going even for a doctoral candidate in German. Yet its traces can
be seen in contemporary American translation, from Wes Craven's
film ``Music of the Heart'' to the new conservatory complex in this
Middle American metropolis, which once elected Jerry Springer
mayor.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   Historically, Americans have envied the public largess that
Europeans used to consider normal. Today, as their own baby-boomers
age, health costs climb and economies stagnate, Europeans
increasingly ask how Americans manage so well without it.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   Craven's homage to Roberta Guaspari's landmark Suzuki violin
program in East Harlem provides part of the answer. Artistic
differences with Madonna caused Craven to substitute Meryl Streep
in the leading role. Yet the very fact that two such different
superstars should leap to play an inspirational violin teacher
might tell us that there is more to the current American
classical-music scene than empty seats and graying audiences.
</P>
<P>
   The long march to a Miramax film by way of Germany, Japan and
East Harlem might tell us something, too. In 1921, Shinichi Suzuki
went to Berlin to study the violin. In 1929, he returned home with
a German wife, Schiller's conviction that great art makes good
people, and a hunch, worked out over the next few decades, that
children could learn an instrument the same way they learned a
language.
</P>
<P>
   But it was in America where his method took off, after a
contingent of tiny Japanese fiddlers dazzled the 1964 meeting of
the American String Teachers Association. By latest count, there
are some 1,500 registered Suzuki teachers in Japan, 5,600 in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   Among them is Guaspari, whose program acquired such resonance
that the New York music establishment famously stepped in to save
it when the Board of Education cut financing in 1991. Fed from the
uniquely American salad bar of private contributions,
patron-friendly tax laws, media attention and civic respect for
achievers, her nonprofit Opus 118 Music Center has since become
something of a Field of Dreams for inner-city children with
quarter-size Chinese violins.
</P>
<P>
   If the lesson is, ``Build it and they will come,'' the
University of Cincinnati's new conservatory complex is as
instructive as East Harlem and in many ways more representative. A
major river's length from the cultural citadels of the east coast,
Cincinnati is American Generic, with an impressive waterfront, a
lovingly preserved art deco hotel, a bank mysteriously known as
Fifth Third, and the large civic presence of Procter &AMP; Gamble. It
also boasts a May Festival, clearly descended from Schumann's
Dusseldorf prototype; a 3,400-seat concert hall in a part of town
still known as ``Over the Rhine''; and a long history of local
support to cover the resulting deficits.
</P>
<P>
   By the 1960s, the old infrastructure, including two 19th-century
conservatories and a city university, was nonetheless badly frayed.
The solution turned out to be a cocktail of personal initiative and
American-style public spending that Schiller himself might have
proposed had he been a management professor at the University of
Cincinnati rather than a sometime history professor at the
University of Jena.
</P>
<P>
   First, the conservatories merged. Second, they were absorbed as
the College Conservatory of Music of the University of Cincinnati.
Third, the university was absorbed in the Ohio public system. By
the early 1990s, 1,000 students were pushing hard on the
conservatory's resources, and administrators were again thinking
seriously about the links between the arts and the civic culture.
</P>
<P>
   When the new conservatory opened recently, guests could admire
the architect Henry Cobb's elegantly functional ensemble of stages,
recital halls, classrooms and storage spaces, neatly designed to
bridge a former gothic dormitory and a recycled women's gymnasium.
The name of the Corbett Center for the Performing Arts recognizes a
major patron. That of the Robert J. Werner Recital Hall honors the
entrepreneurial dean who leveraged private patronage into a major
commitment by the board of regents and the Ohio legislature.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the guests walked past a plaque in the lobby that most
Americans would take for granted. But Schiller would probably have
noticed it, and it is hard to imagine that it escaped the attention
of one guest in particular, Robert Helmschrott, the director of the
Bavarian State Conservatory in Munich.
</P>
<P>
   The plaque acknowledges more than 40 corporate and individual
contributors, all private except for the National Endowment for the
Arts. Private contributions accounted for about 25 percent of the
$90 million project. But above all, they document the easy
interaction of the private and public sectors. Combined with a
historic capacity for importing and energizing immigrant
enterprise, this may be America's biggest comparative advantage in
the early 21st century.
</P>
<P>
   The interaction is virtually personified in Kurt Sassmannshaus,
the chairman of the conservatory's string department. On arriving
in Cincinnati in 1982, Sassmannshaus began developing and combining
a clientele extending from 6-year-olds to concert performers with
networks extending from the Ohio Valley to China. What an economist
might call Sassmannshaus' vertically integrated violin
multinational is one of the conservatory's comparative advantages.
It leads full circle back to Schiller.
</P>
<P>
   Like many American success stories, this one begins with
opportunity knocking. In the 1920s, Dorothy Richard Starling earned
a teacher's certificate and diploma from the Cincinnati
Conservatory. She also studied for one year with the great Eugene
Ysaye and for three more with the legendary Leopold Auer. On her
death in 1969, her husband, Frank M. Starling, of Houston, created
a foundation in her name, dedicated to violin teaching.
</P>
<P>
   The special relationship with Cincinnati began with a call to
Werner's predecessor as dean, Jack Watson. Since then, the Starling
Foundation has also endowed chairs at Indiana University, the
Juilliard School, the Curtis Institute and Carnegie-Mellon
University. But Cincinnati has always been the bellwether and
pacemaker. After consulting the renowned LaSalle Quartet at the
university, Watson offered a new chair to Dorothy DeLay of
Juilliard, a legendary teacher in her own right.

CINCINNATI: own right.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   To everyone's delight, DeLay accepted, bringing with her three
assets that helped turn a promising start-up into a global player.
The first, amplified by scholarship money from Starling, was her
own magnetic field, drawing talent from as far away as Korea,
China, Japan, Germany, Russia, Romania, Albania and Israel. Today,
60 percent of the Cincinnati conservatory's violin students are
international.
</P>
<P>
   The second was her own network of artist managements, concert
managements and instrument dealers going back to the 1940s, and
extending from Juilliard, still DeLay's institutional home, to the
Aspen Music Festival in Colorado and the Beijing Conservatory.
</P>
<P>
   The third asset was Sassmannshaus. A violin teacher's son from
Wurzburg, Germany, and a graduate of the Cologne Conservatory,
Sassmannshaus reassessed his own sense of the instrument after
hearing and meeting a few of DeLay's prodigies in the late 1970s.
With a grant from the German Academic Exchange Service, he set out
for Juilliard. On the eve of his return to Germany for a
respectably tenured career as a big-city concertmaster, a job
opened at Sarah Lawrence College.
</P>
<P>
   It was already clear to Sassmannshaus that the typically
American conjunction of conservatory and foundation would let him
do things that were practically impossible at home. In Germany, as
on most of the Continent, foundation aid is underdeveloped.
Civil-service status practically forecloses private, even
nonprofit, spinoffs. Civil-service law defines permissible working
hours. Sassmannshaus took the American job on the spot. He has
never regretted it.
</P>
<P>
   A new job in Cincinnati allowed him to act on a second
observation. All the emblematic teachers, he noticed, made their
mark with very young players. Aided again by seed money from
Starling, he added another working day to his conservatory teaching
week and started a Saturday music school for 9- to 16-year-olds.
</P>
<P>
   Their names and faces as diverse as the unit roll call in a
World War II movie, some 20 youngsters have turned up weekly since
1987 from as far away as Chattanooga, Tenn., Sioux City, Iowa, and
St. Louis. Awaiting them on arrival is a full-service curriculum of
theory, ear training, private lessons and quartet playing, as well
as the Starling Chamber Orchestra, which appears regularly at the
Aspen Festival and has toured Germany, Turkey and China.
</P>
<P>
   At first, Sassmannshaus himself did the management and
paperwork. He then turned again to the parent foundation; created
the Starling Project Foundation with a board made up of Starling
parents, including an executive of the city's power company; opened
a downtown office; and hired a manager to deal with logistics and
grant applications. Referred by teachers, chance acquaintances and,
in one case, the violinist Isaac Stern, Starling players emerge
from an audition process that admits one candidate in 10.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think of a Saturday without Starling as a wasted day,'' said
Ryan Miller, a high school senior from nearby Middletown, Ohio.
Linda Johnson, a Starling mother from Festus, Mo., said that the
students regard one another as peers and mentors. Their mothers
regard one another as a support group.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, with help from selected conservatory students,
Sassmannshaus took the next step, a pilot program for 6-year-old
beginners at Seven Hills, a group of private elementary and prep
schools. The program is intended to generate a school chamber
orchestra within four years.
</P>
<P>
   If participants in the Starling program opt for careers in
music, Sassmannshaus will be pleased. His job, as he sees it, is to
ensure that they learn what they need to know to make it as
teachers, orchestra players, chamber musicians and, at least in
theory, soloists.
</P>
<P>
   But solo careers are not the object. Nobody thinks less of a law
school graduate for not making the Supreme Court. If Starling
students prefer to be lawyers, that is OK with Sassmannshaus, too.
Then they can come back and join his board, he adds cheerfully.
</P>
<P>
   Among them, the pieces make up an arabesque of synergies and
virtuous circles. Parents, patrons, foundations and the
conservatory, which subsidizes the Starling program with rent-free
rehearsal halls, classrooms and practice space, dance cheek to
cheek. Younger students create jobs for older students. Talent
attracts more talent. Contacts lead to more contacts.
</P>
<P>
   University fund-raisers travel with Starling CDs. A letter from
Streep accompanies the orchestra's recent videocassette. ``Music
has the power not only to bring great joy to children's lives,''
she writes, ``but to encourage in them an awareness that diligent
effort brings lasting rewards.'' In other words, arts education as
civic education.
</P>
<P>
   At the dedication, Liu Yang, 23, wowed the opening-night
audience with a scorching performance of Sarasate's
``Zigeunerweisen'' on a Guarneri on loan from Dietmar Machold,
whose shops in New York, Bremen, Zurich, Tokyo and Vienna make him
perhaps the world's only truly global violin dealer. A Chinese
national prize winner, originally dispatched to America to study
with DeLay, Liu now studies with Sassmannshaus.
</P>
<P>
   Next January, Liu will perform at a national New Year's concert
in the Great Hall of the People in Beijing, which will be televised
around the nation. Meanwhile, the Starling orchestra has been
invited back for another tour of China. While there are no current
plans for Germany, Schiller's Weimar should come due around 2005,
the 200th anniversary of his death.

   FORT WORTH, Texas: pests, Russel says. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Schools, golf courses and cities responsible for controlling
ants in parks, roadways, athletic fields and public swimming
complexes pay much of the cost, Russell says.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Texans shelled out $80.6 million for repairs and
$152 million to replace electrical equipment such as swimming pool
pumps and air-conditioning units destroyed by fire ants, according
to Drees' calculations.
</P>
<P>
   Medical treatment, primarily for over-the-counter remedies, cost
Texans an additional $47.2 million.
</P>
<P>
   Treatment is aimed primarily at preventing secondary bacterial
infection, which may occur if the blister is scratched or broken.
</P>
<P>
   Most folks should clean the bite with soap and water and apply a
topical corticosteroid ointment or antihistamine cream to relieve
itching. An oral antihistamine such as Benadryl may also help
relieve itching and keep you from scratching the bite.
</P>
<P>
   If used quickly enough _ within 15 minutes of getting stung _
ammonia or diluted bleach (1:1 bleach and water) will quickly break
down the protein in the ant's venom and lessen the pain and
itching.
</P>
<P>
   The Extension Service urges neighbors to work together to treat
the whole neighborhood with a two-step program using bait and
insecticide to control fire ants.
</P>
<P>
   ``We like to see people take the less toxic approach and use a
pesticide bait (available at feed and grain stores, nurseries and
discount centers, such as Wal-Mart) or one of the botanical
products available, such as pyrethrin,'' Russell says. ``Beneficial
insects won't eat the bait.''
</P>
<P>
   The first step is a wide-broadcast application of a bait over
the entire yard, while the ants are out collecting food during the
early morning, cooler evenings and at night. The ants collect the
bait and take it home to eat, but it can take several weeks to
work.
</P>
<P>
   The second step is to treat individual mounds with a little of
the approved insecticides such as diazinon. Mounds also can be
treated directly with boric acid, vinegar or a citrus oil product
or by pouring two to three gallons of boiling water directly into
the middle of the mound to kill ants more quickly _ within two to
three days.
</P>
<P>
   Overuse of insecticides, especially diazinon, has become an
environmental problem, and experts say using gasoline is a bad idea
because it is extremely flammable and contaminates the
environment. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   FLEAS, TICKS AND MOSQUITOES &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Fire ants and killer bees sound more exotic and dangerous, but
in Texas, ticks and mosquitoes present a bigger health problem
during the summer.
</P>
<P>
   This year's mild winter and early summer heat are bringing out
the ticks and fleas in force, and mosquitoes can't be far behind,
says Julie Rawlings, chief of the Infectious Disease Epidemiology
and Surveillance Division at the Texas Department of Health in
Austin.
</P>
<P>
   A bite from an infected tick can cause Lyme disease, Rocky
Mountain spotted fever or ehrlichiosis, she points out. Mosquitoes
sometimes carry dengue ``break-bone'' fever and encephalitis.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Louisiana, they are already reporting equine encephalitis
in horses, and in South Texas, we have been checking on some dengue
fever cases,'' Rawlings said.
</P>
<P>
   Last year's dengue fever outbreak, which continued into
December, might have been worse than a 1980 outbreak in which 63
Texans came down with the tropical disease, according to state
health officials who are continuing to review the cases.
</P>
<P>
   Fifty-six dengue cases were confirmed by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had no encephalitis in humans last year, but several equine
cases were reported in East Texas,'' Rawlings said.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Texas reported 10 cases of Rocky Mountain spotted
fever _ up from two or three the year before.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lyme disease is the state's most prevalent tick-borne
disease,'' Rawlings says. ``We have 50 to 100 cases that meet the
case definition out of 200 to 300 suspect cases each year. The
definition is very strict, and reporting is bad, and tests for it
aren't perfect, so there could be a lot more of it out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Spotted fever can be deadly, but Lyme disease can cause more
chronic, incapacitating problems, Rawlings says.
</P>
<P>
   A vaccine is available for Rocky Mountain spotted fever and is
recommended for people in Texas who are outdoors in wooded areas
for long periods, including farmers and ranchers, telephone line
workers, and Parks and Wildlife staff, Rawlings says.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are bit by ticks every day in this state. You need to
protect yourself, no matter what. Wear long pants and long-sleeve
shirts tucked into boots, and use repellents, the same type as ward
off mosquitoes. DEET does the best job,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   She always carries tweezers for ``tick checks'' whenever she is
outdoors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Families and other people outside together should check each
other for ticks every two or three hours. If you find one, grasp it
as close to its mouth part as possible and pull it straight out
with a steady motion. If you don't have tweezers, cover your
fingers with a Kleenex and pull it off.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't touch it with a hot match or cover it with petroleum
jelly, like some people recommend. If the tick gets irritated, it
can regurgitate its stomach contents and make matters worse,''
Rawlings warns.
</P>
<P>
   Pets should be examined, and ticks removed in the same way.
Several new products are available from veterinarians to kill fleas
and ticks on pets.
</P>
<P>
   Keeping your yard mowed and trimmed will help greatly to reduce
flea and tick and mosquito problems, and several new chemicals are
highly effective for treating the yard.
</P>
<P>
   ``Probably most important is to treat everything you need to
treat at the same time,'' Russell says. ``It doesn't work to treat
animals today and the yard next weekend. Because of the life cyles
of insects, you need to treat your carpets and bedding and pets and
yards all at the same time to be effective.''

By CAROLYN POIROT 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Ah, the good ol' summertime, when mosquitoes
eat us alive, fire ants raise welts on our bare feet, fleas and
ticks plague our poor pets, and bees and other fearsome insects
terrorize our parks and playgrounds.
</P>
<P>
   Armed with stingers and occasionally ready to bite, the bugs of
summer start taking over the great outdoors about the same time we
foolish humans begin venturing out wearing fewer clothes _ just
daring those bugs to attack.
</P>
<P>
   Concerned? You should be. This summer, the usual pests should be
a little worse than average, because of the mild, dry winter and
the timing of spring's rains, says Paul Jackson, the Texas A&AMP;M
researcher who confirmed last month that Africanized honeybees,
better known as ``killer bees'' have indeed found their way into
North Texas.
</P>
<P>
   And, yes, that's another sting of summer to worry about. An
entomologist and the state's chief apiary (beehive) inspector,
Jackson says this is a good year for swarming (good for the bees,
that is).
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had more swarm reports this year than either of the last
two, in part because of the mild winter,'' Jackson says. ``The
timing on the rains has also been good for the bees. We've had
plenty of flowers for them, blooming over a longer period than
usual. You could say Mother Nature has been kind to the bees the
past six months.''
</P>
<P>
   We're glad she's kind to some creatures. Meanwhile, here's what
you need to know about protecting yourself from the bugs that bite
in this season of stings.
</P>
<P>
   AFRICANIZED HONEYBEES &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The first Africanized bees crossed the South Texas border near
Hidalgo in October 1990, and Jackson had previously quarantined 119
Texas counties to help prevent the spread of the aggressive
critters.
</P>
<P>
   He quickly corrects anyone who uses the term, ``killer bees.''
</P>
<P>
   Their venom isn't any stronger, in general, and they are
slightly smaller than their more genteel European cousins, he says.
The bees get their bad rap because they swarm for a much longer
season each year and are very aggressive about protecting their
nests, Jackson says.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have bred wild bees to become gentle,'' Jackson points out.
``In Texas, we've got queen breeders that have been selected and
bred for gentleness and high production for more than 100 years.
Africanized bees act like the wild bees they are _ highly defensive
around their breeding nests.''
</P>
<P>
   They are more likely to sense a threat at a greater distance,
become more upset with less reason and sting in much greater
numbers.
</P>
<P>
   ``A domestic honeybee may sting you on the arm, and release
pheromone that will attract other bees, and 30 seconds later you
may have five stings. Africanized bees do the same thing, but 50 or
100 or 500 may come at you as soon as they sense the first sting,''
Jackson says. ``That's what we are worried about _ large numbers.
Each bee can sting only once.''
</P>
<P>
   A person may be stung hundreds of times in a few moments. In
isolated instances, people and animals have been stung to death
because they could not get away from the bees quickly enough. Some
pets and livestock were reportedly killed because they were penned
up and could not escape the bees.
</P>
<P>
   Wild bees were imported from Africa to Brazil in 1952 to
strengthen some breeding programs. They did well in hot desert
conditions, but somewhere along the way a few queens escaped, mated
with European drones and began swarming north, inbreeding their
strongest wild traits.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't distinguish them from regular honeybees just by
looking,'' says Scott Russell, the entomologist in charge of
Integrated Pest Management for the Tarrant County office of the
Texas Agricultural Extension Service.
</P>
<P>
   During a massive brood rearing period, there may be 35,000 to
40,000 bees in a colony, and when there are lots of baby bees, the
adults are highly protective. Disturb them, and they will come
after you, and they are easily disturbed. Step on a vine 20 feet
away, and the vibrations might disturb them. In the late afternoon,
casting a shadow near them may cause a disturbance, the bee experts
say.
</P>
<P>
   To escape a deadly attack, run away, and don't swat the bees.
Swatting will only make more bees want to sting you. Run inside and
shut the door if possible, Jackson recommends. If a pet is trapped
in a cage or even the back yard, open the gates so it can escape,
and turn on the sprinklers or hose. Bees stop flying when their
wings get wet.
</P>
<P>
   Pest control experts recommend calling a beekeeper to remove any
bees, or an exterminator with a high-pressure hose to kill them.
</P>
<P>
   Any time you see nests near the ground, especially under mobile
homes or in and around water meters or in holes or cracks in
building walls or tree cavities or drainage pipes or junk piles,
you should suspect Africanized bees and call an exterminator. Don't
try to spray them yourself, Jackson says.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, he recommends staying away from all bees, just to be
safe. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   FIRE ANTS &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Imported fire ants infest more than 260 million acres in the
Southern United States, where they are the No. 1 agent of insect
stings. Since the first fire ants were dumped near Houston in 1958,
they have taken over more than 80 million acres in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Those first fire ants were accidentally imported in tons of dirt
used for ballast on cargo ships coming back from South America, the
experts say.
</P>
<P>
   Almost everyone bitten by a fire ant develops an itchy,
localized hive or lump at the sting site, followed by a small
blister or white pustule within about 24 hours. Each ant can sting
multiple times.
</P>
<P>
   If you have been stung by any ant, chances are it was a
``Solenopsis invicta,'' the red imported fire ant, says Bart Drees,
coordinator of the Texas Imported Fire Ant Research and Management
Project at Texas A&AMP;M University.
</P>
<P>
   Fire ants are a major burden to Texans in rural and urban areas.
They cost millions of dollars annually in control and treatment and
to repair and replace equipment damaged or destroyed by the pests,
Russell says. MORE &QL;

<P>
   NEW YORK _ In yoga classes from New York to San Francisco, a
voice emanates from compact disc players, leading students through
their salutes to the sun. The tone is deep, open, American. The
music accompanying it pushes ahead like rock 'n' roll, stirred by
African rhythms or prettified by a New Age flute. But this sound is
not merely for relaxation or exercise.
</P>
<P>
   The words are Sanskrit, the ancient invocational tongue of
India, and the repetitive melodies stimulate a trancelike mental
openness. This is the gospel sound of American yoga, expressed in
the music of Krishna Das.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody loves music,'' Krishna Das, the chanting master who
was born Jeffrey Kagel in Long Island in 1947, said in a recent
interview at Les Deux Gamins in Greenwich Village. ``Here's an
offering of music that's also claiming to be a spiritual practice.
It's not heavy, it's not hard, you don't have to sit there not
moving all day as somebody beats you on the back with a stick. But
it is meditation.''
</P>
<P>
   The tuneful route to spiritual bliss is surging in popularity.
Organized chanting sessions, called kirtans, happen weekly
throughout New York. Even at gyms like Crunch, many classes begin
and end with a short chant. No longer are cries of ``Hare Krishna''
uttered only in airports by saffron-robed ecstatics. Like bindi
jewels and the writings of the Dalai Lama, yogic hymns are making
enlightenment accessible.
</P>
<P>
   Krishna Das is an unassuming icon of this trend. A practitioner
of Bhankti yoga, the devotional limb of mystical Hinduism, he has
fashioned himself into a ``kirtan wallah,'' or traveling singer,
bringing divine praises to gatherings nationwide. Yoga Journal
recently called him ``The Pavarotti of Kirtan.'' His most popular
album, ``Pilgrim Heart'' (1996), has sold nearly 50,000 copies. He
has sung with Sting and given instruction to Madonna. He tours
constantly; in May alone he led 14 events, including the keynote
address at the national ``New American Yoga'' conference at Kripalu
Yoga Center in Lenox, Mass. Triolka Records, the label he cofounded
10 years ago, has been significant in building the bridge between
world and New Age music.
</P>
<P>
   Meditation beads around his neck, cellular phone at the ready,
Krishna Das might seem to some to be a cultural interloper who has
found a way to turn his hippie ideals into a profitable venture.
Yet he remains unpretentious. It's easy to believe his claim of
doing what comes naturally.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's perfectly natural that a Westerner should go to
India, soak it up and come back and then work with the forms
they've absorbed in this lifetime, which for me was Little Anthony
and the Imperials and rock 'n' roll,'' said this self-described fan
of the Clash. ``I've never formally trained in Indian classical
music, which is an extraordinarily subtle and amazing technique.
I've never had the discipline, and now I just don't have the time.
I want to sing to God, I want to sing to my own heart. And I want
to be open.''
</P>
<P>
   Unfettered enthusiasm is the source of Krishna Das' art. His
kirtans could make an atheist drop his guard. At a recent session
at the Jivamukti Yoga Center in downtown Manhattan that attracted
about 200 people, the genial leader began with a joke about missing
``The Sopranos'' and a gentle reminder that this music was not just
entertainment, but prayer. He cued his band, which included Jim
Donovan, the percussionist for Rusted Root, the Bansuri flute
virtuoso Steve Gorn and a crowd of other players and singers on
both Indian and Western instruments.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll sing a line and all y'all sing along,'' he said,
beginning an invocation to the monkey deity Hanuman.
</P>
<P>
   Krishna Das pumped his harmonium, and the full band added heft
to the litanies. Although one skeptical newcomer leaned over to a
stranger and opined, ``He's the Studio 54 of chanting,'' most
attendees let the proverbial spirit take them, whether they
believed in the chants or simply relished the strong, simple
melody.
</P>
<P>
   ``I try to loosen people up,'' Krishna Das said later. ``This
isn't a course in how to chant. We're chanting! It's a
hootenanny.''
</P>
<P>
   Sharon Gannon, a founder of Jivamukti, said: ``K.D. has just
kept developing. He's like the tortoise in the story of the
tortoise and the hare. He keeps plodding along, and now he's won
the race.''
</P>
<P>
   Krishna Das' journey reflects the twisted path of yoga in
America, which evolved from a health craze to a part of the
countercultural dream in the 1960s, quietly developed in the '70s
and '80s and has returned to full force within the holistic
lifestyles of the new century. A midcareer period of retreat primed
the singer for his current, fortuitously timed comeback.
</P>
<P>
   Like so many young people in the 1960s, Jeffrey Kagel turned to
Eastern practice out of frustration and hope. ``There was a
tremendous naivete,'' he said. ``We thought we could change the
world. A lot of people got very discouraged and felt very betrayed
by life, when things didn't change just because they took acid.''
</P>
<P>
   Playing in bands and on his own, Krishna Das sought freedom in
folk music, the blues and even heavy metal. A new route opened up
when he met Ram Dass, whose inspirational books about life under
the guidance of the guru Neem Karoli Baba had taken the
counterculture by storm. In 1970, he traveled to India.
</P>
<P>
   ``In India, they didn't see me as a failed, depressed rock 'n'
roller,'' he said. ``They saw me as a devotee of the god, and they
honored that tremendously.''
</P>
<P>
   The stimulating environment and the guidance of Neem Karoli Baba
led the newly dubbed Krishna Das to a new musical challenge. ``I
sang with guys who were chanting, for hours, sometimes 10 hours at
a time,'' he said. ``When I first came, I couldn't even keep a
beat. They gave me this big cymbal. And one guy would go like
this,'' he said, clapping his hands together, ``and then he'd take
his hand away and I'd mess up. And he'd do it again. All day for
three days. At the end of a few days I had it.''
</P>
<P>
   Krishna Das lived blissfully at Neem Karoli Baba's temple until
1973, when he returned to America at the guru's behest. His teacher
called him back about a year later, but Krishna Das, who was making
money and enjoying a new romance, hesitated. Within months, Neem
Karoli Baba died.
</P>
<P>
   ``It ran over me like a truck,'' he said. ``I thought I had
blown it, and could never be happy.''
</P>
<P>
   Fighting off depression, Krishna Das pursued music in Northern
California. He played in an early world-fusion band, Amazing Grace,
with Jai Uttal, another popular modernizer of kirtan. He toured
with Ram Dass, singing before the writer spoke, an activity he
continues.
</P>
<P>
   He also got into the music business with two friends, Mitchell
Markus and Paul Sloman. They founded Living Proof Records in the
late 1970s to record jazz elders they admired. The label, later
renamed Triloka, shifted toward world music with successful
releases from the sarod master Ali Akhbar Khan and the Tahitian
Choir.
</P>
<P>
   ``The label's identity came out of Krishna Das' and my
experience with India,'' Markus said by telephone from a recording
studio in Los Angeles, where the label is still based. ``The idea
is to keep intact the culture from which the music comes, and yet
make it completely accessible to a Western audience.''
</P>
<P>
   As Triloka grew, Krishna Das sequestered his own talent. He sang
only in small circles of friends. He intermittently returned to
India, seeking relief from his torment over Neem Karoli Baba's
death.
</P>
<P>
   Then in 1994, living in New York, he realized that singing with
strangers might actually help him. ``I knew I was hiding stuff,''
he said. ``I had to sing with people in order to reach it.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   One night he attended a Jai Uttal concert at Jivamukti. He
noticed that the studio offered satsangs, or religious services.
``The next morning I got a phone call,'' Gannon remembered. ``This
man said: `Hello, my named is Jeffrey Kagel, and I also used to
chant. I know you have evening satsangs. I could do some chanting
after you talk.' He was such a nice, humble guy. I said, `OK, why
don't you come by this afternoon and we'll talk this over.' I left
for the yoga center, and when I arrived, there he was!''
</P>
<P>
   The Monday night kirtans soon drew a crowd, including musicians
and vocalists whom Krishna Das nicknamed his ``posse.'' He was
alternately pleased and bothered by his newfound fame. Back in
India in 1995, he prayed for inner reconciliation. To his surprise,
in the flash of recognition that seekers call satori, he attained
it. After that, the pieces of his vocation rapidly fell into place.
</P>
<P>
   He has released three albums since 1995, the most recent of
which is the double disc ``Live on Earth ... for a Limited Time
Only.'' Krishna Das says he can deal with such attention now,
neither recoiling from it nor letting it rule his ego.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's changed in him is what's different about a lot of us
who went over to India,'' Markus said. ``Major things like
developing a real sense of humor and an awareness of the poignancy
of any moment in your life. He's really becoming who he is, without
second thoughts about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet even the peace Krishna Das has found, and his subsequent
success, has not tempered a certain melancholy within. Sharon
Gannon thinks it is the force behind his growing renown.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of my teachers in India told me that for a song to be a
really good song it must have the element of sadness,'' she said.
``It has to wrench your heartstrings, that yearning. Unfulfilled
desire. Krishna Das has that. He still is the blues singer.''

 &HT;    Gators-Vols is CBS' top football pick
 &HT;    By Tony Barnhart
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DESTIN, Fla. _ CBS has made the Sept. 16 Florida-Tennessee game
the No. 1 pick for its SEC television football package for 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the annual SEC spring meetings indicated that the
Florida-Tennessee game, which would be played in Knoxville, would
be broadcast at 3:30 p.m. CBS does not have the option of showing a
prime-time game this season.
</P>
<P>
   CBS gets six of the top nine preseason picks for games while
ESPN gets the other three. The other games picked by CBS were
Alabama at Tennessee, Oct. 21; Auburn at Alabama, Nov. 18; Georgia
vs. Florida in Jacksonville, Oct. 28; Auburn at Florida, Oct. 14;
and Georgia Tech at Georgia, Nov. 25. All except Georgia
Tech-Georgia should start at 3:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   ESPN used its top pick in the rotation to select the
Tennessee-at-Georgia game Oct. 7. That game is expected to start at
7 or 7:30 p.m. Other games picked by ESPN were Alabama at Arkansas
on Sept. 23 and Arkansas at Tennessee on Nov. 11.
</P>
<P>
   A complete television schedule will be released this summer.
</P>
<P>
   GOODBYE FOR C.M
</P>
<P>
   Technically, this will be the last SEC meetings for Kentucky
athletics director C.M. Newton, who retired earlier this year.
Newton, who is scheduled to be inducted into the Basketball Hall of
Fame, isn't sure about his future plans. Some of the league's
basketball coaches think he would be an excellent commissioner of
college basketball.
</P>
<P>
   Many basketball people have complained that non-basketball
people have been making decisions for the sport, such as the recent
decision to end summer recruiting in 2001. They think that college
basketball has a unique set of problems and should have its own
governing body. Newton, who played at Kentucky and coached at
Alabama and Vanderbilt, would be the perfect person to lead that
body, they say.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need a guy like C.M. in there calling the shots,'' Alabama
coach Mark Gottfried said. ``He's been there. He knows the problems
that are unique to the sport.''
</P>
<P>
   VOTE FOR KRUGER
</P>
<P>
   Kentucky basketball coach Tubby Smith, who was thought to be a
candidate for the Hawks job vacated by Lenny Wilkens, said Atlanta
made a good choice in former Illinois coach Lon Kruger.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know it can be tough for college guys trying to break into
that league, but, I'm telling you, Lon is a tough guy,'' Smith
said. ``I've coached against him, and I really believe the young
guys on that team are going to be able to relate to him.''
</P>
<P>
   WORTH NOTING
</P>
<P>
   The SEC's athletics directors voted 12-0 to approve the new
football scheduling format. It will result in such games as
Florida-Alabama and Georgia-Alabama being played more often. The
league's presidents still must give final approval on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Florida is contemplating a multi-million-dollar renovation to
the press box and other facilities at Ben Hill Griffin Stadium. The
school is conducting a feasibility study. Florida's new athletic
budget was approved at more than $43 million.
</P>
<P>
   Mississippi State soon will begin a renovation to Scott Field
that will raise the seating from 40,656 to more than 55,000. It is
scheduled to be completed for the 2001 season.
</P>
<P>
   The football coaches discussed a new rule that would allow
quarterbacks to throw the ball away after they have break the
pocket and not be called for intentional grounding. The rule
basically is the same as the NFL's.

&HT;     CHRISTY MARTINEZ OF LAREDO FALLS IN FIRST ROUND OF SPELLING
BEE 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By JUDY HOLLAND  
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Christy Lynn Martinez, an 8th grader from Laredo,
Texas, who started spelling competitively this year, stumbled over
the word philately in the 73rd National Spelling Bee Wednesday and
was eliminated after the first round.
</P>
<P>
   Christy, 13, approached the imposing black podium on the stage
where the contest was held and asked the so-called pronouncer to
repeat philately, which means stamp collecting. She then paused and
asked him to define it and use it in a sentence.
</P>
<P>
   Then she quickly tried P-H-A-L-A-T-A-L-L-Y.
</P>
<P>
   That's when she heard the dreaded bell that signals a mistake
and was ushered away from the stage into the bee's ``comfort room''
to regain her composure.
</P>
<P>
   But almost immediately she appeared smiling beside her father,
Arnulfo Martinez, an oil field worker for Chevron who measures how
much oil comes out of wells.
</P>
<P>
   Christy said ``it was scary'' when she was on stage and realized
she didn't know the word.
</P>
<P>
   But her father put a positive spin on the event. ``It's an honor
to have one of your children compete at a national level,'' said
Martinez, who grew up in Nuevo Laredo, Mexico, and became a U.S.
citizen in 1987 along with his wife Silvia.
</P>
<P>
   ``This trip is like a reward for her diligence,'' he said. ``We
never thought that we would be here.''
</P>
<P>
   Christy's mother Silvia Martinez predicted that the experience
will give her daughter new ideas about what she can become in life:
``She will be able to do anything that she wants to,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Martinez, an assistant at a company that researches
property titles and the daughter of a Mexican produce peddler,
labeled the trip to Washington ``a great experience.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We got to see a lot of places we never dreamed of,'' such as
the U.S. Capitol, the Lincoln and Washington monuments, the White
House and the U.S. Holocaust Museum, she said.
</P>
<P>
   She said Christy, who is always searching for a good book, was
reading ``The Diary of Anne Frank,'' a book by a Jewish teenager
who perished in the Holocaust along with her family.
</P>
<P>
   Silvia Martinez said she and her husband have always stressed
education for their four daughters, of which Christy is the
youngest.
</P>
<P>
   ``We try to encourage her to stay in school,'' said Silvia
Martinez, who dropped out of high school herself and later got her
general equivalency diploma.
</P>
<P>
   At home, both parents speak Spanish to their children. ``We
don't want them to lose their heritage,'' Arnulfo Martinez said.
</P>
<P>
   Christy is an honors student at Crossroads Christian Institute
who volunteers as a babysitter in the nursery of her church, of
which the school is a part. Her father is an elder at the church.
</P>
<P>
   Christy, who beat 56 other competitors from Laredo area schools
last month in the regional spelling bee, said she would like to be
a pediatrician or a veterinarian.
</P>
<P>
   The National Spelling Bee, sponsored by E.W. Scripps Co.,
continues with final rounds on Thursday.

 &HT;    Net pioneer: E-mail needs more emotion
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. _ E-mail might work better in the hands of
William Shakespeare than it does for the guy in the cubicle next to
you.
</P>
<P>
   That limitation of Internet communication frustrates Mitch
Kapor, founder of Lotus Development Corp., co-founder of the
Electronic Frontier Foundation and keynote speaker at the third
biannual Harvard Conference on Internet and Society, which
continues through Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Kapor thinks the future of the Internet lies in developing ways
to allow people to communicate face-to-face without actually being
in the same place. But even he, as a venture capitalist, knows
better than to put money into that.
</P>
<P>
   As a venture capitalist currently working in Silicon Valley,
Kapor says the driving force of the Net right now is focused on the
reshaping of business, leaving other pressing needs undeveloped,
unexplored and unfunded.
</P>
<P>
   However, Kapor still believes that the Net isn't just about
commerce. ``The humanist in me refuses to give up,'' he told the
capacity crowd at Harvard's Sander's Theater.
</P>
<P>
   He sees the future of the Net not in the convergence of the PC
and the television, but in the convergence of e-mail and telephony.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still communicate through text e-mail and the written
word,'' he said. That, he said, is where a great many problems
arise as Web users struggle to say what they mean and mean what
they say when they craft an e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   ``The written word is lovely in the hands of Shakespeare,''
Kapor said. ``But most people have trouble expressing their
feelings and opinions in e-mail.''
</P>
<P>
   He said part of the problem is that text-only messages strip
away body language, tone of voice and other ways that people use to
communicate.
</P>
<P>
   Kapor says he's adopted a personal rule that if his message is
crucial, he'll either use the telephone or actually seek out the
person he wants to speak to.
</P>
<P>
   However, he believes that eventually there will be a way for the
Internet to combine the personal inflections of phone or in-person
contact with traditional e-mail functions. ``What the Net lacks is
`emotional bandwidth,' '' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Does this mean all computers will come complete with Web cams so
users can see each other in real time? Kapor says no. ``Web cams
are not the answer,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he said he was placing his bets on the possibilities
generated by computer graphics and avatars, or representations of
people so that users can see their emotions as they communicate
their e-mail messages.
</P>
<P>
   But before e-mail can be taken to the next level, there is the
question of development and funding. Kapor worries about how this
type of development could be done in the current start-up climate.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't get them funded in the current angel
investor/venture capital environment,'' he said. ``These things are
very interdisciplinary, and it could be a public issue. But we need
to find the institutions who can do the basic research.''
</P>
<P>
   Kapor has a cautious optimism about the future of the Net.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some things about the Internet you have to love if
you have a beating human heart,'' said Kapor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made a lot of speeches saying the Internet was going to make
everything better, but I was wrong,'' he said. ``The Internet will
not bring the end of civilization or herald a new utopia. It's
going to be somewhere in the middle.''

SOFTBANK MISSES DEADLINE TO ACQUIRE NIPPON CREDIT BANK 
</HEADLINE>
   (SUBS to CORRECT name of Tokio Marine and Fire Insurance Co. in 3rd
graf.)  
 By STEPHANIE STROM   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ The Softbank Corp., Japan's leading Internet company,
was dealt a setback Wednesday in efforts to acquire a large
insolvent bank nationalized by the government, which said it would
seek other possible buyers.
</P>
<P>
   An investment group led by Softbank had won the exclusive right
to negotiate the purchase of the Nippon Credit Bank three months
ago, in what was described at the time as a deal with far-reaching
implications for Japan's banking and Internet industries. But the
deadline for reaching an agreement, which had been extended once,
expired Wednesday with little progress made on the terms.
</P>
<P>
   The Financial Reconstruction Commission, the regulatory agency
overseeing the overhaul of Japan's troubled financial sector, said
it intends to keep talking to the Softbank-led group, which
includes Orix Corp., one of Japan's largest leasing companies, and
Tokio Marine and Fire Insurance Co. But the agency said it would
also talk to other potential bidders.
</P>
<P>
   Regulators said they could not agree with the Softbank group on
the scope of Nippon Credit Bank's bad loans and the value of the
collateral backing those and other loans. ``Those three each had an
opinion over how to estimate and deal with bad loans,'' said Shoji
Mori, a senior commission official. ``The situation at the final
meeting was that we were far from reaching an agreement.''
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, the Softbank-led group, which had tentatively
offered 100 billion yen, or about $938 million at current exchange
rates, for the bank, said it would continue to pursue Nippon
Credit.
</P>
<P>
   Some financial analysts were betting that the Softbank group
would win the bank, one of two big banks nationalized during
Japan's financial crisis in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have a credible business plan, and they want the
bank,''said Dean Perry, an analyst who tracks non-bank financial
companies at ING Barings.
</P>
<P>
   Government officials, speaking privately, said the failure to
meet Wednesday's deadline reflected political concerns over how
much responsibility the government would be forced to accept for
loans that sour after the sale.
</P>
<P>
   The commission has recently been criticized by politicians over
the terms of its deal to sell the Long-Term Credit Bank, the other
nationalized bank, to an investment group led by Ripplewood
Holdings LLC, a U.S. investment fund.
</P>
<P>
   Long-Term Credit Bank has emerged as the largest creditor of
several firms that have recently gone bankrupt or asked their
creditors for substantial debt forgiveness. Under the terms of
Ripplewood's agreement, the government must take responsibility for
bad loans that arise from such circumstances, lessening
Ripplewood's risk.
</P>
<P>
   Political concerns about the sale of these banks have come as
the country prepares for contentious parliamentary elections that
could weaken the power of the dominant Liberal Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   Approval ratings for the Cabinet led by Prime Minister Yoshiro
Mori plunged to a record post-war low this week, according to a
poll done by the Asahi Shimbun.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the setback to Softbank, some analysts welcomed the
possibility that it may not acquire Nippon Credit.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought this was a very expensive way to buy a banking
license that came with too much legacy management,'' said Thomas
Rodes, who follows Japan's Internet industry at Nikko Salomon Smith
Barney.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The failure to reach a deal by Wednesday's deadline did not come
as a complete surprise. Japan's Internet business community has
buzzed with rumors that Softbank's ardor for the deal was cooling.
</P>
<P>
   Yoshitaka Kitao, president and chief executive of Softbank
Finance Corp., Softbank's financing subsidiary, has been openly
debating the wisdom of buying into Nippon Credit Bank with
Masayoshi Son, Softbank's founder and chief executive, who wants to
use the bank to finance the fledgling companies that have
historically lacked access to bank financing here.
</P>
<P>
   Kitao has questioned whether Softbank can assume the risk of a
bank that has a sizable portfolio of bad loans, particularly at a
time when Softbank's own financing is considered shaky. The company
has a speculative credit rating, its stock has fallen more than 73
percent since February and earnings plunged 77 percent in the
fiscal year that ended March 31.
</P>
<P>
   Son has dismissed such concerns, saying Softbank has more cash
on hand than the total of its debts due for the next eight years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have enough reserves to repay all debts at once if we
want,'' he told a news conference last week.

ADVERTISING: PUBLIC SERVICE ANNOUNCEMENTS REQUIRE SPECIAL
CREATIVITY 
</HEADLINE>
   By ALLISON FASS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When it comes to public service campaigns, the goal is not so
very different from the intent of advertising for commercial goods
and services. Public service announcements, which appear pro bono
on behalf of organizations that promote safety, health and social
causes, must engage the audience and build awareness.
</P>
<P>
   To that end, the producers of pro bono campaigns are working
harder than ever, it seems, to catch the attention of television
viewers and readers of magazines and newspapers. Their
unconventional creative efforts _ on issues as disparate as
Parkinson's disease, birth defects, suicide prevention and vision
impairment _ have another audience, too: the so-called gatekeepers
in the media who determine which few public service announcements
will benefit from free time and space out of the many that are
pitched.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole point of public service advertising is to get
somebody to take action,'' said Gary Scheiner, vice president and
associate creative director at McCann Relationship Marketing
Worldwide in New York, part of the McCann-Erickson World Group unit
of the Interpublic Group of Cos. ``You have got to make the most of
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, McCann Relationship Marketing used the season finale
of the ABC sitcom ``Spin City'' as the vehicle for a public service
announcement for the Michael J. Fox Foundation for Parkinson's
Research. The star of the series, Michael J. Fox, who has
Parkinson's, appeared in the commercial, discussing how he was
leaving to devote his time to help search for a cure for the
disease.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you've got somebody like Michael, you'd be an idiot not to
use him,'' said Steve Cowles, senior vice president and group
creative director at McCann Relationship Marketing.
</P>
<P>
   Another agency, The Lord Group in New York, a joint venture of
Dentsu Inc. and Young &AMP; Rubicam Inc., took a different creative
approach _ casual humor _ to bring attention to a serious health
issue. A television campaign for the March of Dimes encourages
women to take a daily multivitamin with folic acid, which could
prevent birth defects.
</P>
<P>
   Avoiding a stodgy approach that would have, say, delineated the
chemical effects of folic acid, the commercials show a live stork
arriving at an office to tell an employee she is pregnant. As the
visitor inches its way through the cubicles, employees react
differently: a woman tries to lure the stork closer with a sandwich
and a man climbs on his chair to avoid it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Humor gives it a more contemporary tone,'' said Penny Redfern,
an associate creative director at Lord, so ``you don't necessarily
realize it's a PSA.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In order to change their behavior,'' she added, referring to
the target audience, ``you've got to shake them up. Just giving
them the information straight, they're not going to change.''
</P>
<P>
   Along the same lines, Henry Hagerty, the president at the Think
Bank in New York, which represents companies that produce special
effects for advertising, created a short film meant to serve as a
public service announcement to raise awareness about suicide.
Hagerty plays the lead role in the film, called ``Easter
Clearing,'' which he said was based on a dream he had after a
friend committed suicide.
</P>
<P>
   The short film tells the story of a distraught man who loses
interest in his thoughts of suicide when he finds himself suddenly
trying to save a kidnapped child.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not the easiest film to watch,'' Hagerty said. ``But if
you could just save one life with that film, wouldn't that be a
cool thing to do.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Easter Clearing'' can be viewed at www.atomfilms.com, the Web
site of Atom Films in Seattle. The film has also been distributed
at 340 centers of the National Mental Health Association, said
Patrick Cody, a vice president at the association, where it is used
to begin discussion groups for suicide survivors.
</P>
<P>
   Another organization trying to get the attention of a specific
audience is Lighthouse International in New York, which helps blind
people and people with partial vision lead more independent lives.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of starting a campaign to promote its cause, Lighthouse
prepared pamphlets that seek to demonstrate how contrasting colors
and more legible text can benefit readers. The goal is to encourage
agencies that produce ads and TV commercials with text on screen to
make them more readable.
</P>
<P>
   The effectiveness of print as an advertising medium is being
weakened, said Jerry Della Femina, chairman of Della Femina/Jeary &AMP;
Partners in New York, because 13.5 million Americans 45 or older
suffer some form of vision impairment even when wearing glasses or
contact lenses.
</P>
<P>
   Della Femina said he sent a memo to the art directors at his
agency, owned by top managers and the Omnicom Group, urging them to
make sure the type in the ads they create is larger and more
readable. He is also helping Lighthouse organize meetings to
educate agencies and advertisers about the guidelines and form an
advisory board to sponsor a competition of the ``best and worst''
ads in terms of readability.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's good business to make type large enough for people to
see,'' Della Femina said. ``It's not just altruism, it's smart.''

 &HT;    MICROSOFT SETS STAGE FOR BREAKUP APPEAL
 &HT;    600&AMP;add. Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ An embattled Microsoft Corp. drew a legal road map
Wednesday of how it will contest a likely judicial decree to break
up the world's largest software company that could come as soon as
this week.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's lawyers issued their antitrust battle plan in the
form of a lengthy response to a government proposal that would
slice the firm in two. The Justice Department and 17 states filed
their final brief last Friday at the behest of U.S. District Judge
Thomas Penfield Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft charged that the ``government's proposed final
judgment is defective in numerous respects, making the document
vague and ambiguous.''
</P>
<P>
   It suggested numerous substantive and technical changes in the
breakup document, but then added: ``No comment, or lack thereof,
should be construed as reflecting Microsoft's ... agreement with
any aspect of the government's (plan).''
</P>
<P>
   For example, it sought to delay the implementation of any
breakup for 12 months following the expiration of a stay, assuming
it lost an inevitable appeal that could go directly to the U.S.
Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   The federal antitrust laws were changed in the mid-1970s to make
it easier to bypass the federal court of appeals in cases of
significant national importance.
</P>
<P>
   After a widely watched 78-day trial, Jackson branded Microsoft
as an abusive monopolist that had squelched innovation in the
software industry, strong-armed its competitors and harmed
consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Under the government's final proposal, Microsoft would be
divided into two separate companies. One would run its core Windows
operating system. The other would market its applications software,
such as Microsoft Office, as well as Internet products, such as
browsers and online services.
</P>
<P>
   But the company, claiming it has done nothing wrong, has
rejected the proposed breakup as an unjustified and extreme action
that would injure its consumers, its employees and its investors.
</P>
<P>
   Taking sharp issue with Jackson's abrupt closing down of the
landmark trial on May 24, Microsoft said it was its ``position and
understanding'' that the hearing ``was to be the beginning _ not
the end _ of proceedings on the issue of relief. Microsoft
believed, and still believes, that its position and understanding
were well-founded in both law and fact.''
</P>
<P>
   In playing its last legal card, Microsoft offered, under a
``supplemental offer of proof,'' to bring to court such top
executives as Michael Kapellas of Compaq and Jeffrey Katzenberg of
DreamWorks SKJ, who would testify to the negative effects a
Microsoft breakup would have on their companies and industries.
</P>
<P>
   But under Jackson's restricted timetable, those potential
witnesses, as well as Microsoft chairman Bill Gates, are unlikely
to ever be heard in the landmark case. The government, in its
revised filing, had called the proposed Microsoft extended witness
list a ``cynical ploy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Anyone who sat in the courtroom at the final hearing last week
had to come away with the impression that the judge wanted to the
government to give him a 'clean copy' of a final judgment so he
could sign it and get on with the appeal,'' said Rick Rule, a
former head of the Justice Department's antitrust division and a
current Microsoft legal adviser.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point, it would take the judge all of 10 minutes to
file his final judgment with the clerk,'' said William Kovacic, an
antitrust expert at the George Washington University School of Law.
``It's entirely possible we might see that later this week.''
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't be surprised to see Judge Jackson rule by the end
of this week,'' echoed Joe Sims, an antitrust lawyer at Jones Day
Reavis &AMP; Pogue. ``He hasn't shown a lot of patience here
recently.''
</P>
<P>
   Steven Salop, a professor of economics and law at Georgetown
University Law Center said Jackson ``wants to get something on the
table that could get appealed, since there is an expectation that
any remedy he orders will come back to him for refinement.''
</P>
<P>
   Experts disagreed about whether the Supreme Court would agree to
take the case directly.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not just any case. It's in a narrow category where
Congress has provided the option for direct review,'' said Donald
Falk, an attorney at Mayer Brown &AMP; Platt in Washington. ``It's not
a privilege that the government has abused over the past 26 years
</P>
<P>
   However, ``there are good reasons for the Supreme Court not to
take the case directly,'' said Bill Kolasky, head of the U.S.
antitrust practice at Wilmer Cutler &AMP; Pickering in Washington, D.C.
``There is a large, complicated factual record in this case that
would benefit from an appellate review.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there is an above 75 percent chance that the Supremes
will not get the case immediately,'' said Richard Gray, a lawyer at
Outside General Counsel in Menlo Park, Calif. who has followed the
Microsoft case for the San Jose Mercury News. ``I think you're
looking at two years in the appeals court.''

THE NOISE FROM THE CANDY WRAPPER IS INEVITABLE 
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Mass., Md.)   By JAMES GLANZ   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A team of physicists has made a giant leap in understanding the
prime scourge of audiences for opera, theater and concerts _ the
crinkling and crackling of candy wrappers.
</P>
<P>
   But their work will be scant help to audiences maddened by the
noise. The scientists demonstrated what plenty of dismayed
concertgoers have already intuited: the noise is inevitable no
matter how the candy is opened.
</P>
<P>
   The research, which will be presented on Friday in Atlanta at a
meeting of the Acoustical Society of America is the most detailed
examination ever of just how and why the mood-destroying noise is
generated in the kinds of materials that wrap candy.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers, Eric Kramer, a physicist at Simon's Rock
College in Great Barrington, Mass., and Alexander Lobkovsky of the
National Institute of Standards and Technology in Gaithersburg,
Md., asked themselves why even the most careful, painfully
deliberate extraction of a piece of hard candy from its wrapper
does not seem to reduce the amount of sound produced as a desperate
audience member tries to relieve a dry throat, invariably just as
Tosca reaches the sublime pathos of ``Vissi d'Arte.''
</P>
<P>
   By recording crinkled wrappers as they were slowly stretched in
an otherwise silent chamber, and then digitizing and analyzing the
sound emissions on computers, the researchers found that the noise
was not continuous, but consisted of individual bursts or pops just
thousandths of a second long. Their loudness, the researchers
discovered, has nothing to do with how fast wrapping is undone.
Rather, the pops occur at random volumes as tiny, individual
creases in the paper suddenly rearranged themselves during the
overall shape change _ as the candy is unwrapped.
</P>
<P>
   The physics of wrappers turned out to be surprisingly complex,
said Kramer, who found analogues in the conformation changes of
large protein molecules in the human body and the magnetic
properties of materials in computer memories.
</P>
<P>
   But because the series of minute shape changes from wrapped to
unwrapped is unavoidable, the experiment's practical implications
were tragic news for every alas-poor-Yorick moment of great drama.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can follow that sequence as slowly as you want, but each
step in the sequence is accompanied by a click,'' Kramer said.
``And there's nothing you can do about it.''
</P>
<P>
   On Broadway, where announced reminders to turn off cell phones
and beepers are accompanied by the suggestion that hard candy be
unwrapped before the curtain rises, the results may be about as
welcome as a bad review. But this parsing of the intricate behavior
of such a familiar object will find a ready audience among
scientists who study neither atomic nor cosmic realms, but rather
the physical middle ground between the very small and the very
large.
</P>
<P>
   Kramer said he no longer remembered exactly why he and Lobkovsky
began recording crinkling plastic. But he said that they became
intrigued by a fact that most people take for granted: smooth,
unwrinkled plastic has only one ``stable'' configuration, since no
matter how it is bent (as long as it is not creased), the plastic
will fall flat again. But crushed and wrinkled plastic has
innumerable stable states: deform it, and it holds the shape or
something close to it.
</P>
<P>
   So the researchers recorded the noises emitted during the slow
stretching of a common plastic that they had crushed and recrushed
many times. ``As far as we know, no one had ever looked at this
sound before,'' Kramer said.
</P>
<P>
   They were surprised to find an irregular series of extremely
brief pops with unpredictable energies that varied by a factor of a
million.
</P>
<P>
   In creating a theory of wrappers, the researchers found a
parallel in another common phenomenon, the rolling of a boulder
over a hilly, irregular landscape. Different wrapper conformations
correspond to the boulder's rolling into different depressions in
the landscape. And like a theatergoer gradually opening a wrapper,
someone might push the boulder very slowly up a hill. Nevertheless,
at some point it will tumble quickly down the other side, and, in
the case of the wrapper, emit that irritating snap.
</P>
<P>
   As homely as that process is, it has much in common a large drug
molecule that behaves differently in the body _ beneficially or
dangerously _ depending on what conformation it falls into, said
James Kakalios, a physicist at the University of Minnesota. ``If we
understood that, it would have a revolutionary impact on
everybody's life,'' since a new generation of therapeutic drugs
could be engineered, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But what does the research say about how to unwrap a piece of
hard candy when, horribly, a tickle in the throat arrives during
the final, fading bars of Tchaikovsky's ``Pathethique''?
</P>
<P>
   ``Unwrap it as quickly as possible and get it over with,''
Kramer said.

WHITHER THE BOY BANDS?

   UNDATED:eye-popping productions. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   With this popularity comes higher expectations. In the '60s, the
Beach Boys' Brian Wilson drew inspiration from the Beatles and gave
the world ``Pet Sounds;'' the Beatles, in turn, listened to that
record and came up with ``Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band.''
</P>
<P>
   Nobody is suggesting that the 'N Sync/Backstreet rivalry will
lead to a pop masterpiece on that level, but it is obvious that
both groups are trading off their time atop Boy Band Mountain, and
that they are seeking more creative control over their music in an
attempt to be more than a passing fancy.
</P>
<P>
   The Backstreet Boys wrote a couple of songs on ``Millennium.''
They also took a step toward capturing a more mature audience in
April when they appeared on the VH1 special ``Men Strike Back,''
sharing the stage with established adult-contemporary pop/rock
stars such as Sting, as well as Tom Jones and young R&AMP;B trendsetter
D'Angelo.
</P>
<P>
   Bristling from their wrangle with Pearlman and RCA, the members
of 'N Sync made a point of trying to give ``Strings'' a grittier,
more hip-hop-flavored edge. Half the CD was written by band
members; also, they recruited noted hip-hop producers Teddy Riley
and She'kspeare, and covered Johnny Kemp's ``Just Got Paid.''
</P>
<P>
   Trying to do this years ago wouldn't have worked. But this
latest revival of bouncy, bubblegum pop in the mid- to late'90s
coincided with the popularity of hip-hop. As a result, the
transition from one to the other does not seem as much of a stretch
as it would have seemed back during the days of the New Kids.
</P>
<P>
   And let's not forget about the respect a band gets from selling
millions of records _ and how it can wield that respect.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bigger a group gets, the more creative control they can
have,'' Rubin says. ``They have the clout to say, `I want to write
more songs' or `I want to produce.' Backstreet is writing most of
their new album together. They raise the bar and it gives them more
artistic freedom. It allows them to grow but not totally abandon
their roots.''
</P>
<P>
   In a recent conference call, 'N Sync's Lance Bass and Joey
Fatone underscored this point.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is just us,'' Bass says of ``Strings' '' hip-hop flavor.
``We wrote a lot; it's our baby. The pressure was definitely on
because everyone was going to know it was us and if anyone had any
fault with it or hated it, it was on us. But the fans love it, and
that's all we really care about.''
</P>
<P>
   The R&AMP;B/hip-hop direction was ``what we like,'' Fatone says.
``The fans like our style of music first, and their second favorite
is hip-hop and R&AMP;B. We think it's a totally different sound for us.
We call it dirty pop.''
</P>
<P>
   The question is whether this evolution of sound will enable 'N
Sync and Backstreet Boys to sustain their success, and to be making
records five years from now. The pop audience has always been
fickle, but, Isaak says, never so much as it is now, with new acts
debuting weekly and groups being more likely to be one-hit wonders.
</P>
<P>
   ``Longevity is a thing of the past,'' he says. ``The highway is
littered with bands and artists who weren't able to keep their
career going past one or two albums.''
</P>
<P>
   With so much money being made so quickly, there is always the
possibility that a member might leave to go solo, following in the
footsteps of Michael Jackson (the Jackson 5) and George Michael
(Wham!). But can 'N Sync or the Backstreet Boys survive intact?
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no way you can call it,'' Rubin says. ``The typical
life of a teen idol is four years, unless they can break out of the
mold. Ricky Nelson went from teen idol to rock 'n' roll.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key is if they want to, or can, grow with the audience,''
he says. ``What people want to hear when they're 15 is not what
they want to hear when they're 20. If they can start to go there
and beyond, they might have some legs.''
</P>
<P>
   Isaak says that selling fewer CDs the next time out would not
sound a death knell for either group. Dozens of performers _ among
them Pearl Jam, Alanis Morissette, Sting, U2 and The Cure _ no
longer sell nearly as many CDs as they did in their heyday.
</P>
<P>
   But all continue to sell well enough to keep major label
recording contracts and to attract large crowds when they tour.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bon Jovi is still together _ they still have a career,'' Isaak
says. ``It's really hard to predict what will happen. I think it
would be healthy for 'N Sync to take on new groupings or do solo
stuff and it's likely that will be the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``Change isn't a bad thing, and 'N Sync will always be able to
play somewhere, somehow.''

COMMENTARY: ABSENCE OF SHTARKERS 
</HEADLINE>
   By WILLIAM SAFIRE    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When Prime Minister Ehud Barak of Israel meets
President Clinton on Thursday, he will report his expectation of a
deal with Yasser Arafat that can be signed on the White House lawn
in time to affect the U.S. elections. It is a great political gift
and a greater security gamble.
</P>
<P>
   Key to the establishment of a Palestinian state in almost the
entire West Bank is Barak's startling decision that the Jordan
Valley is no longer needed for Israel's defense.
</P>
<P>
   Even in Labor's dovish ``Allon plan'' of generations ago, that
buffer behind the West Bank of the Jordan River was considered
essential to slow an Arab attack. But Barak, along with another
former army chief of staff, just made a military decision that
changed today's negotiating equation.
</P>
<P>
   In the new military thinking, it would be unwise to continue to
station Israeli forces in the valley between the Kingdom of Jordan
and the new state of Palestine. If those two states were in
alliance, goes the convenient analysis, Israeli troops would be in
a crossfire. If those two states came into conflict, then Israel
would be in the middle, unwillingly involved.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody likes to admit this, but Israel's abandonment of the
historic valley presages the end of minority Hashemite rule in
Jordan. The new king is pleading with Barak to retain at least a
sliver of territory along the river to shield his regime from
Palestinians bent on avenging their bloody defeat in ``Black
September'' of 1970; they still want a trans-Jordanian ``Greater
Palestine.'' ``With a common border,'' says Ariel Sharon, leader of
Israel's opposition, ``the existence of the Hashemite Kingdom is
only a matter of time.''
</P>
<P>
   Barak's military reassessment clears the way for the kind of
pre-emptive territorial concession Arafat cannot refuse. For years,
realistic deal makers have been talking about a final settlement
that would give the Palestinians two-thirds of the West Bank, with
Israeli settlements not close to Jerusalem or Tel Aviv in security
zones. The addition of the Jordan Valley means that some 93 percent
would go to the new Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
   However, casualty-weary Israel's badly organized retreat from
its buffer zone in Lebanon, betraying longtime local allies, has
whetted Palestinian appetites: if Hezbollah can force the Jews out
of ``every inch,'' why can't we?
</P>
<P>
   ``I hear that Arab neighborhoods in Jerusalem,'' says the
Likud's Sharon, ``will get a Zone B status, with municipal
administration by the new Palestinian entity. That means the
division of Jerusalem.'' He calls the overlapping jurisdiction and
befuzzing of sovereignty _ a sure source of future friction _
``foolish and irresponsible.''
</P>
<P>
   Barak and Arafat will call it peace. In his farewell October
surprise, with his wife campaigning at his side, Clinton will
confidently give America's promise to underwrite the cost.
</P>
<P>
   Barak has also promised Israelis a referendum on both this deal
and his giveback of the Golan Heights to Syria. He will argue that
such a Lesser Israel is not necessarily weaker; on the contrary,
that a time of peace in the region will let Israel strengthen its
alliances with the United States, the Europeans (already offering
inducements in the United Nations) and the technology-hungry
Chinese.
</P>
<P>
   The political presumption is that if he can set the rules for a
referendum to require only a majority of those voting, Barak's
sweeping concessions are likely to prevail. Diplomatic cheering,
economic incentives and global media enthusiasm provide momentum;
the despair of Israel's battle-fatigued and the hopefulness of its
forgetful add to the campaign against caution.
</P>
<P>
   Is acceding to a Lesser Israel a dangerous gamble? Yes. Are
these leaks about the extent of Israel's concessions intended to
shock so they can be reduced? Probably. Should Israel seek evidence
of Arab trustworthiness before rolling its security dice?
Definitely.
</P>
<P>
   People with views like mine call ourselves shtarkers. That's
based on the German word for ``strong,'' with a self-mocking
Yiddish connotation of ``hard-line, insufferably resolute.'' Israel
started out as the land of shtarkers. Maybe that's changed.

WHITHER THE BOY BANDS?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVE FERMAN 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Screeeeeeeeeeam!
</P>
<P>
   That is a sound heard only in one setting in the known universe:
an arena or stadium filled with hormone-charged teen-age girls
shrieking uncontrollably over the boy band on stage.
</P>
<P>
   It's like the old Spinal Tap joke about setting the amps on 11:
When 'N Sync or the Backstreet Boys are performing, there is a
sustained, nails-on-blackboard shriek that starts at
dentist's-drill decibels and increases to eardrum-shattering
proportions when the video cameras zoom in on, say, 'N Sync lead
hottie Justin Timberlake. And it never lets up. Not until the night
is over.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, those screams are the sound of money being made and CD
sales records being demolished: Boy bands may have been around for
decades, but the past several years have seen an explosion in
popularity brought on in large part, experts say, by a robust
economy, new marketing tools and a pop landscape that emphasizes
ear-candy over angst and guitars.
</P>
<P>
   This phenomenon may have hit its apex with 'N Sync's latest,
``No Strings Attached.'' After an ugly legal battle involving
former Svengali Lou Pearlman, this is the band's first CD with Jive
Records (home also to Britney Spears). ``Strings'' sold 1.3 million
copies the day it was released, 2.4 million its first week, 5
million in five weeks, and 7 million in eight weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We couldn't dream of having a goal like that,'' says group
member Joey Fatone Jr. ``The fans broke the record. A lot of people
are interested because of what we're about and the music we stand
for. It's not like we're just trying to throw something together to
sell the album. We really do put our blood, sweat and tears into
it.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the commercial catfight between 'N Sync and
the Backstreet Boys continues unabated. 'N Sync was hotter last
summer; then the Backstreet Boys released their latest,
``Millennium'' (11 million copies and counting) and did a sold-out
tour.
</P>
<P>
   Now its 'N Sync's turn again; J.C. Chasez, Justin Timberlake,
Fatone, Chris Kirkpatrick and Lance Bass have the summer to
themselves; more than 1 million tickets (worth about $40 million)
were sold the first day the tour dates went on sale. The Backstreet
Boys and their new CD won't be back in the mix until the fall.
</P>
<P>
   The boy band second string _ LFO, 98 Degrees, Youngstown, all
attractive young men with high voices _ grows daily, and public
interest in All Things Boy is so intense that ABC is airing
``Making the Band,'' a weekly documentary-style program showing how
a new boy band was recruited.
</P>
<P>
   So how much more of this can we expect? And why are there so
many boy bands out there?
</P>
<P>
   After all, the last white-boy band this hot was New Kids on the
Block, a group that filled stadiums and sold millions of records
without any imitators coming along to share the wealth.
</P>
<P>
   But the playing field has changed since then. According to
Jackie Rubin, with the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, and Wayne Isaak,
VH1's executive vice president for talent and musical programming,
the influence of the Internet (from live broadcasts to band Web
sites to chat rooms) fuels fans' interest in young groups to a
massive degree. So do shows such as ``Total Request Live'' and
groups performing on the Disney Channel, Nickelodeon (which is
sponsoring its own summer tour) and HBO.
</P>
<P>
   It's like the early days of MTV times 10.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are just so many more formats right now,'' Isaak says.
``That's why they sell more than ever. Now you have 7-year-olds at
Backstreet Boys shows. And now there are a lot of moms who love it.
They're more likely to have their 'N Sync experience. It's more
inclusive.''
</P>
<P>
   Marketing people, Rubin says, ``have the formula down to a
science. There are more groups, and they feed off each other.
There's a teen explosion at least once every decade in America, and
with the economy doing so well, the kids have more fun money to
spend.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the boy-band phenomenon grew out of people turning away
from the anger and hopelessness of grunge. The success of Hootie &AMP;
the Blowfish signaled the beginning of the change, and behind them
came Hanson and the Spice Girls, Ricky and Britney.
</P>
<P>
   Smiley pop music, Isaak says, usually flourishes in good times
because people generally feel better about themselves and their
future.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a chicken-and-the-egg effect,'' says Geoff Mayfield,
columnist and director of charts at ``Billboard'' magazine. ``Which
came first _ the boy bands or pop being so hot? One feeds the
other; pop is hotter so it feeds the groups, and they feed pop, and
so on.''
</P>
<P>
   Plus, young moms are buying more boy-band material than ever.
This is partly because the boys in the bands are often in their
20s, and part of it is because the groups' CDs are well-produced
and their live shows are such eye-popping productions. MORE &QL;

 &HT;    Austin business travelers will soon be able to conduct business
from the airport
 &HT;    By Kirk Ladendorf
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Three Austin business women say they want to
make Austin-Bergstrom International Airport more business-friendly
by making travelers' waiting time more productive.
</P>
<P>
   At their business center, which is scheduled to open July 1,
they plan to offer conventional business center services, including
printing, copying and foreign currency exchange.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the Austin Airport Business and Technology Center
plans to offer extra services for private member businesses for an
annual fee of between $42,000 and $78,000 a year. They will get
private meeting space at the airport, where they can have a drink,
conduct a private business meeting, plug in a computer to a
high-speed Internet connection and rent wireless phones. They could
even have advertising messages played on video terminals throughout
the airport.
</P>
<P>
   The business center won't be the only place at the airport with
an Internet connection. The City of Austin has struck a deal with
Austin-based Wayport Inc. to offer a wireless Internet service,
city officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Wayport, a 2-year-old startup that is still testing its service,
is among a group of companies competing to deliver wireless and
wired Internet access at hotels, airports and other public areas
around the country.
</P>
<P>
   The mix of private and public services gives the new
1,800-square-foot Austin Airport Business and Technology Center a
good shot at profitability, said Stacy Rhone, its chief executive.
Her research of conventional business centers at airports showed
that many of them lose money because their services are too
limited.
</P>
<P>
   City officials agreed. The city let Rhone and her partners put
together a wider array of services to give them a better chance of
succeeding.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are optimistic that the services they will be providing
will allow them to have a successful business venture that will
also serve us and serve business travelers,'' said Charles Gates,
finance director for the City Department of Aviation.
</P>
<P>
   Rhone and partners Nancy Fisher and Norma Garza secured more
than $400,000 in financing from Xerox Corp. to build and equip the
center. A Xerox spokesman said the business center is an good
opportunity to showcase its products and services to business
travelers.
</P>
<P>
   They also negotiated a concession with the city. The city will
receive a guarantee of $5,000 minimum rent from the business
center. It also will receive 5 percent of the business center's
annual revenue between $50,000 and $100,000 and 7 percent of the
its revenue over $100,000. The city will also share in advertising
revenue for closed-circuit video advertising.
</P>
<P>
   The public part of of the center is under construction in the
airport ticketing lobby near the Southwest Airlines ticket counter,
while the private lounge and meeting area is being built on the
mezzanine level and is reached by elevator.
</P>
<P>
   The three entrepreneurs say they are marketing corporate
memberships earnestly to local high-tech companies and others that
want to conduct business meetings at the airport or offer services
to business travelers.
</P>
<P>
   The business center's first corporate member, United Bank of
Switzerland, wants to use the business center as a place where its
traveling bank executives can conduct meetings with local clients,
Rhone said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Business people can fly in and fly out and get their business
done quickly in the right atmosphere with a variety of extra
services,'' Rhone said.
</P>
<P>
   The business center won't be the only members-only lounge and
business service center at the airport. American Airlines operates
its Admiral's Club near Gate 13, one of more than 40 Admirals Clubs
that American operates systemwide. The club, which is open to
members who pay a $400 annual fee, offers a lounge, two meeting
rooms, Internet connectivity and some basic business services,
including fax and copying.
</P>
<P>
   Continental Airlines also operates a members club at the
airport.

candidate Jesus Silva-Herzog; new 17th, 18th grafs to explain polls
 &HT;    WILL WELFARE BE USED TO COERCE KEY VOTES IN HISTORIC MEXICAN
ELECTION?
 &HT;    (550&AMP;ADD)
 &HT;    By SUSAN FERRISS 
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ A month before the most bitterly fought
presidential election in Mexico's recent history, the ruling party
is under increasing fire for using federal welfare programs to lure
or coerce votes for its candidate.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Mexican President Ernesto Zedillo told farmers in
Morelos state that subsidies and other assistance ``get to where
they need to get, to your hands, without intermediaries,
bureaucrats or political manipulation.''
</P>
<P>
   Zedillo's comments seemed designed to quell complaints that some
bureaucrats are threatening to withhold subsidies to the poor
unless recipients pledge to vote for Mexico's 71-year-old
Institutional Revolutionary Party, the PRI, on July 2.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to Zedillo's speech, however, a top campaign advisor
to the PRI's candidate bluntly said in a national magazine article
published last Sunday that the PRI is ``at war'' and will use those
programs to fight to keep power.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, federal social programs are carried out by the PRI, and
their aim is to win the presidency,'' said veteran PRI politician
Manuel Bartlett, who joined the campaign of PRI candidate Francisco
Labastida Ochoa shortly after it was widely perceived that
Labastida had lost a nationally televised debate in April.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have no reason to deny it . . . ,'' Bartlett told Milenio
magazine. ``We are at war and if the public employees there are PRI
sympathizers they should defend the party.''
</P>
<P>
   Bartlett, a former Puebla state governor, ran unsuccessfully
against Labastida in a PRI primary election last year. He is
considered one of the old-fashioned PRI strongmen called
``dinosaurs.'' Although Bartlett denies it, he is widely suspected
of using his position as a cabinet member in charge of elections in
1988 to engineer fraud on behalf of the PRI's then-presidential
candidate.
</P>
<P>
   The PRI, which has controlled Mexico's presidency for seven
decades, has a history of doling out gifts of food and building
supplies to the poor before elections.
</P>
<P>
   This year's race comes in the wake of democratic reforms to make
elections fairer and cleaner. But opposition parties say they are
still concerned about PRI activists in remote areas attempting to
coerce votes by threatening to cut government subsidies.
</P>
<P>
   About 30 percent of Mexican voters live in rural areas, which
are a stronghold of PRI support.
</P>
<P>
   One program under scrutiny is Progresa, a family welfare program
started by Zedillo in 1997 that offers cash payments to poor
mothers who keep their children in school.
</P>
<P>
   More than 2.6 million families _ 14 million individuals _ are
enrolled in the program. Several publications in Mexico have
reported complaints by women in rural Veracruz and Chiapas states
that program promoters are warning them to vote for the PRI or
their benefits will be cut.
</P>
<P>
   Labastida aide Javier Trevino challenged critics to prove that
manipulation of social programs has really happened.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't stop investing in social programs,'' he said, just
because an election is about to happen.
</P>
<P>
   He added that Labastida campaign's position is that ``we don't
need any kind of support of activities outside the law.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe what (Bartlett) was referring to is that the government
of President Zedillo has made a commitment to the Mexican people
with these programs,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   A recent national survey of people by MUND Opinion Services in
Mexico City found that 24 percent of those questioned identify
federal social programs with the PRI, not the government. Another
16 percent said they identified programs with both the government
and the ruling party.
</P>
<P>
   About 65 percent of those who receive Progresa said they would
vote for the PRI, according to the survey of 4,634 people in their
homes.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, opposition politicians in the state of Mexico
discovered a storage area rented by a local PRI-dominated
government that was filled with construction materials a PRI
candidate was handing out to poor farmers in the area.
</P>
<P>
   Prior to that, the PI was fined $125,000 because its Mexico
City mayoral candidate, Jesus Silva-Herzog, a former ambassador to
the United States, was handing out government-owned milk in
containers with his photo and the party emblem.
</P>
<P>
   Silva was not found personally guilty because the incident
occurred in February before he had officially registered his
candidacy.

   When his psoriasis is at its worst, David G. Metz has a silvery
scale covering his entire body except the soles of his feet. ``You
leave a trail behind you where you've been _ the skin cells just
fall off,'' he said, adding that this makes him very self-conscious
and reclusive.
</P>
<P>
   But last Christmas, Metz, a 27-year-old Wal-Mart sales clerk
from Columbia, Ill., visited his girlfriend's family in Chicago
without worry. An experimental drug being developed by Genentech
and Xoma, he said, left him ``as normal looking as a person could
look.''
</P>
<P>
   The biotechnology industry is taking aim at psoriasis, a chronic
disease that affects an estimated 7 million Americans and, in its
more serious forms, is far more physically and psychologically
devastating than the mere cosmetic disease it is often thought to
be.
</P>
<P>
   About 30 companies, mainly biotechnology concerns, have
psoriasis drugs in clinical trials, according to the National
Psoriasis Foundation. In a race for the lead are two industry
giants and longtime rivals _ Biogen and Genentech, both of which
have drugs that could reach the market in two or three years.
</P>
<P>
   While none of the drugs are expected to cure the disease
permanently, early test results show that some could be safer and
effective for longer periods than existing drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're looking at several drugs that are almost sure things at
this point,'' said Dr. Mark Lebwohl, chairman of the dermatology
department at Mount Sinai Medical Center in New York, who is
participating in several clinical trials. ``So far, they have been
remarkably benign.''
</P>
<P>
   The new drugs are not expected to greatly affect makers of
existing products _ at least not right away _ in part because many
products on the market have other primary uses, like preventing
transplant rejection. ``I don't think anybody necessarily loses
business,'' said Elise Wang, an analyst with PaineWebber. ``These
drugs will expand the market.''
</P>
<P>
   Though no one knows precisely what causes psoriasis, it is
assumed to be an autoimmune disease, one in which the body's
defenses against infection attack the body's own tissues. It has,
in some sense, become a proof-of-principle disease, one used to
test drugs that companies hope will also be useful for other
autoimmune diseases like rheumatoid arthritis and lupus.
</P>
<P>
   ``In psoriasis, you get a pretty easy readout _ you look at the
skin,'' said Gisela Schwab, vice president for clinical development
for Abgenix, which has chosen psoriasis as the first disease to aim
at with its antibody technology.
</P>
<P>
   But some analysts caution that psoriasis is deceptively hard to
treat and that one company after another has failed in its
treatment efforts.
</P>
<P>
   ``They think it's going to be a short-cut way to test out their
new drug, and it never works out,'' said Cynthia Robbins-Roth, an
industry consultant and the author of ``From Alchemy to IPO''
(Perseus Books), a new book about the biotechnology business.
``It's just a running joke in the biotechnology industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Another drawback, some experts say, is that since psoriasis is
not considered to be a very serious disease, the Food and Drug
Administration might set tougher standards for drug approval.
</P>
<P>
   Still, hope for better psoriasis treatments is being spurred
anew, in part because of the identification of the cells involved
in the attack on the skin by scientists at Rockefeller University
in 1995. Moreover, biotechnology companies in recent years have had
dramatic success with drugs for other autoimmune diseases like
rheumatoid arthritis and Crohn's disease.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been a renaissance in drug development,'' said Dr.
Alice B. Gottlieb, director of clinical research at the Robert Wood
Johnson Medical School. Most of the exciting new drugs, she said,
are from biotechnology companies.
</P>
<P>
   But most must be injected, limiting their appeal.
</P>
<P>
   There are an estimated 200,000 to 1 million Americans with
serious cases of psoriasis. This could mean annual sales of
hundreds of millions of dollars for a successful drug. And for some
companies, the stakes are high. The psoriasis drug Amevive is now
Biogen's best hope for diversifying beyond its first drug, Avonex,
for multiple sclerosis. James C. Mullen, Biogen's chief operating
officer, said the market potential of Amevive was similar to that
of Avonex, which had sales of $621 million last year.
</P>
<P>
   For patients with severe symptoms of the disease, psoriasis can
be debilitating. The red swollen skin covered with the silvery
scale, the most common manifestation, can be itchy and can hurt.
About 10 to 20 percent of psoriasis patients also develop a painful
form of arthritis. Each year, said the psoriasis foundation's Web
site, ``many people with psoriasis are hospitalized, and a few
hundred die from complications of psoriasis or its therapies.''
</P>
<P>
   The psychological effects can also be a problem.
</P>
<P>
   Marge Harris, a 46-year-old meeting planner from St. Louis,
still recalls being ordered to leave a public swimming pool a
decade ago because the lifeguard thought her condition was
contagious. (It is not.) ``I haven't gone swimming for 10 years now
in a public place where I can be humiliated like that again.''

<P>
   Dr. Steven R. Feldman, associate professor of dermatology at
Wake Forest University School of Medicine, said that 25 percent of
the 317 psoriasis patients responding to a survey by his department
said they had considered suicide because of their disease. The
paper on the study was published in September.
</P>
<P>
   In psoriasis, infection-fighting blood cells known as T cells
swarm into the skin cells. They release chemicals known as
cytokines that cause the skin to go into overdrive. New skin cells
proliferate as if trying to heal a wound that isn't there.
</P>
<P>
   Existing treatments can often clear the skin but either lose
their effectiveness over time or have severe side effects that
force patients to stop using them.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Exposure to ultraviolet light slows the proliferation of skin
cells but raises the risk of skin cancer. Drugs called retinoids
can cause birth defects. Women using Roche Pharmaceuticals'
Soriatane, the newest such drug and one safer than its
predecessors, are still cautioned not to become pregnant for three
years after treatment stops. Steroidal creams can cause
deterioration of the skin.
</P>
<P>
   Cyclosporine, made by Novartis under the name Neoral (some
generics of older forms are also available) and used primarily to
suppress rejection of transplanted organs, can cause kidney
disease. Methotrexate, basically a generic product and originally a
cancer chemotherapy drug, can cause liver toxicity. Both drugs take
a sledgehammer approach, suppressing the entire immune system to
stop the immune attack on the skin.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The biotechnology drugs aim to interfere with the immune
reaction that is responsible for the attack on the skin without
affecting the functioning of the rest of the immune system _ an
exceedingly difficult balancing act. The immune system has multiple
pathways, so blocking just one might not blunt the undesired immune
attack. If a drug is too general in depressing the immune system,
however, the patient becomes susceptible to infections or has an
increased risk of cancer.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Biogen's Amevive, for instance, depleted the number of active T
cells in some patients, forcing the company to stop giving the
highest dose. Dr. Burt Adelman, vice president for medical
research, said there was no evidence that patients actually
suffered more infections or cancer. A lower dose, he said, should
solve the problem and still be as effective, though analysts
cautioned that this remained to be seen.
</P>
<P>
   Amevive is designed to prevent T cells from being activated,
which occurs when so-called antigen-presenting cells display a
protein that the T cell recognizes as foreign. The drug disrupts
the mating of the T cell and antigen-presenting cell. The problem
is that this can also affect other T cells, not just the ones aimed
at the skin.
</P>
<P>
   In phase II trials, an intravenous infusion once a week for 12
weeks completely cleared the skin of 30 percent of the patients,
with the improvements lasting six to eight months, Adelman said. He
said the company hoped to apply for approval of Amevive, now in
phase III trials, by the end of 2001, which would mean an approval
could come by the end of the following year.
</P>
<P>
   Genentech and Xoma are just entering phase III trials and appear
to be some months behind Biogen. Their drug is a monoclonal
antibody that neutralizes CD-11a, a molecule that is instrumental
in helping the T cells leave the bloodstream and enter the skin.
The idea is to keep the T cells from getting to the skin but to
allow them to survive in the blood, where they fight infections.
</P>
<P>
   The drug, for now being called Anti-CD11a, has not had the same
problem with T cell depletion that Amevive has had, but some
patients did experience an immune system reaction called cytokine
release syndrome, which produces flu-like symptoms. In an early
clinical trial, 48 percent of patients who got an intravenous
infusion once a week for eight weeks had at least a 50 percent
improvement compared with 15 percent for a placebo. Harris of St.
Louis, who tried the drug, marveled at its lack of side effects.
But she relapsed within a month after she stopped taking it.
</P>
<P>
   Many other drugs are in phase I or phase II clinical trials,
with less evidence of their safety and effectiveness. Abgenix,
which is based in Fremont, Calif., has an antibody designed to
neutralize IL-8, one of the immune chemicals found in elevated
levels in the skin lesions. The Immune Response Corp. of Carlsbad,
Calif., is working on a therapy that uses the immune system to
attack the T-cells specifically involved in the skin inflammation.
</P>
<P>
   Corixa of Seattle is basing its approach on the fact that there
are two types of T-cell responses, TH1 and TH2. It is in early
tests of an immune stimulator that elicits a TH2 response, which
tends to shut down the TH1 response that is prevalent in
inflammatory diseases.
</P>
<P>
   Others are developing drugs that can be swallowed or spread on
the skin, hoping to reach a broader market. Isis Pharmaceuticals of
Carlsbad is testing a topical drug. Ligand Pharmaceuticals of San
Diego is trying to develop a safer version of retinoids.
</P>
<P>
   Also being tested for psoriasis are two drugs that have already
proved successful in other autoimmune diseases: Enbrel, an
arthritis drug made by Immunex, and Remicade, which is used for
arthritis and Crohn's disease and is made by Johnson &AMP; Johnson's
Centocor unit.
</P>
<P>
   Gottlieb said there would be room for several drugs because each
one produces a ``socko'' response in only about 20 percent of the
patients.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Longer term, scientists around the world are trying to find
genes involved in the disease. That is the best hope for a real
cure. For now, though, doctors are just hoping for better
treatments. Dr. Craig L. Leonardi, a dermatologist in St. Louis,
said, ``This is a disease that's been waiting for a new approach
for a long, long time.''

SUGAR-COATED GUIDELINES

<P>
   When the federal government held its first summit meeting on
nutrition 31 years ago, the principal food problem was hunger, and
the proposed solutions were improvements in food stamps and the
establishment of the WIC program for infants, children, and
pregnant women. This week, the second national nutrition summit
found a twofold problem: hunger and obesity.
</P>
<P>
   Combating the latter is complex, and Washington is doing less
than it could to improve American diets.
</P>
<P>
   In three decades, much progress has been made in getting food to
those who need it. Still, a combination of high housing costs, the
unevenness of the economic boom's benefits, and restrictions on
food stamps and other programs forces many Americans to ask for
help in finding their daily bread. In a survey of mayors last year,
85 percent reported that requests for emergency food assistance had
grown, by an average of 18 percent.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the nation's other great nutrition problem is
obesity, now reaching epidemic proportions. One fifth of all
Americans are obese, raising their risk of heart disease, stroke,
and diabetes. Several sessions of this week's summit explore how
schools, employers, restaurants, and the media can change the
patterns of eating and inactivity that lead to obesity.
</P>
<P>
   The summit took place just days after the government updated its
dietary guidelines, as it does every five years, and for the first
time specifically recommended exercise to help avoid obesity.
</P>
<P>
   But the government caved in to the sugar industry by rejecting
language favored by its own panel of scientists calling on
consumers to ``limit'' sugar intake. Instead, the guidelines say
Americans should ``moderate'' their sugar consumption. The wording
change followed a massive lobbying effort by the sugar processing
industry, which has contributed $1.2 million to senators since
1995. In March, 30 senators signed a letter making the
extraordinary argument that there is no proven link between sugar
and obesity.
</P>
<P>
   Government was a public health leader in pointing to the obvious
relationship between cigarettes and cancer, when the tobacco
industry was raising bogus questions about scientific proof. Now,
government can't seem to connect a candy bar with an unhealthy
paunch.

HYUNDAI FOUNDER TO GIVE UP SOME CONTROL; ELDEST SON REFUSES 
</HEADLINE>
   By SAMUEL LEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEOUL, South Korea _ Hyundai Group's founder and chairman
announced radical changes Wednesday that will severely diminish his
family's management role and help South Korea's biggest
conglomerate repay billions of dollars in debts through asset
sales. But the surprise announcement was nearly overshadowed by the
refusal of the chairman's eldest son to relinquish control of
Hyundai's flagship automaker.
</P>
<P>
   The defiance was an unusual public display of family bickering,
and by Wednesday night it was unclear how it might be resolved.
</P>
<P>
   Investors have grown increasingly nervous about the financial
pressures on Hyundai, which revealed some weeks ago that one of its
lending subsidiaries was deeply exposed to the bad debts of another
large South Korean conglomerate, Daewoo Group. The changes
announced Wednesday by the Hyundai chairman and family patriarch,
Chung Ju-yung, were designed in part to ally investor anxieties
about Hyundai's future.
</P>
<P>
   Under the plan, Hyundai will raise about $5.2 billion in cash
through the sale of shares and real estate and cutbacks in
investment projects, and will effectively reduce the number of
subsidiaries from 52 to 16 by year-end. The money raised will be
used to help repay some of Hyundai's $46.5 billion in debts.
</P>
<P>
   Chung also said that he would relinquish his position and that
his two sons, Mong-hun, chairman of the main business group, and
Mong-ku, chairman of Hyundai Motor Co., would resign as well. There
was no word on who would replace them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe that the only way to succeed in a competitive
international climate is for professional managers to lead each
company,'' Chung said in a letter released by Kim Jai-soo, head of
corporate restructuring at Hyundai. ``Instead, we will remain
solely as shareholders in Hyundai companies.''
</P>
<P>
   But shortly after the announcement, Mong-ku, the elder of the
two sons and chairman of Hyundai Motor, said he could not follow
his father's decision. In a statement, Hyundai Motor said its
workers needed the guidance of its current chairman.
</P>
<P>
   Korean press reports said the elder Chung even failed to
convince his son to change his mind over dinner at a restaurant
near Hyundai's Seoul headquarters. ``Hyundai is one of the most
feudalistic companies in Korea in terms of ownership,'' said Chang
Ha-sung, a prominent activist for minority shareholder rights and
professor of business management at Korea University.
</P>
<P>
   The elder Chung's announced retirement from day-to-day
management of Hyundai came as a surprise. The 84-year-old
patriarch, who began the business by opening a rice shop in 1940,
has been a central figure in Hyundai and is regarded as a symbol of
South Korea's family-controlled conglomerates.
</P>
<P>
   The stock market responded positively to the news, with the main
share index jumping nearly 6 percent. The market had slumped in the
past week because of concern over Hyundai's finances.
</P>
<P>
   The South Korean government said nothing about the family
bickering but welcomed Hyundai's restructuring announcement. Over
the past two years, the government has been prodding the nation's
big conglomerates to reduce their size and indebtedness, which are
regarded as important contributors to the financial crisis that
nearly paralyzed South Korea's economy in late 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``The self-rescue plan announced by Hyundai will be reflected
positively to outside investors,'' said Lee Hun-jai, the minister
of finance and economy.

AETNA IN TALKS WITH ING GROUP TO SELL UNITS 
</HEADLINE>
   By TIM ARANGO   
 c. 2000 NYTimes.com/TheStreet.com   
<TEXT>
<P>
   About two months ago, Aetna(AET:NASDAQ), the nation's largest
health insurer, turned down overtures from the Dutch financial
services company ING Group(ING:NYSE ADR). Now, they have renewed
their courtship.
</P>
<P>
   Aetna said Wednesday that it was in talks to sell its financial
and overseas businesses to ING America Insurance Holdings, a
division of ING Group.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement followed an afternoon of speculation about a
possible deal that sent Aetna's stock surging. But Wall Street
analysts greeted the news with a collective shrug, saying that
whispers of possible deals have been floating around for months.
</P>
<P>
   Aetna's shares finished up 4 1/16, or 6.5 percent, at 66 3/4,
after trading as high as 69 following a CNBC report that the two
companies were in talks. ING's American depositary receipts,
meanwhile, edged up 3/16, to close at 60 5/16.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Aetna nor ING, which also confirmed the negotiations
after the stock market closed, would discuss a possible price tag
for Aetna's financial and overseas businesses. But CNBC, citing
unidentified people close to Aetna, said the health insurer was
weighing an offer from ING for as much as $9 billion.
</P>
<P>
   John Rex, an analyst with Bear Stearns who follows Aetna, noted
the rumored $9 billion ING offer for Aetna's financial divisions,
and compared it with the $9.3 billion market capitalization -- the
value set by the market -- for the entire company. ``It's a big
number, a very big number,'' Rex said.
</P>
<P>
   Hartford, Conn.-based Aetna has been talking with possible
suitors for months. In March, ING, along with WellPoint Health
Networks(WLP:NYSE), made a $10 billion bid for the company. But
Aetna turned that offer down and announced plans to split into two
publicly traded companies -- one for health insurance and the other
for financial services.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rumors about taking out Aetna have been driving the stock for
months,'' Rex said. ``I never viewed the company as taking itself
off the table.'' Rex has an 'attractive' rating for the stock, and
Bear Stearns has not been an underwriter for Aetna.
</P>
<P>
   Any potential deal is driven by attempts to increase Aetna's
stock price, analysts said, rather than an effort to shed a sick
business. ``They're working for shareholder value,'' said Jeff
Pittsburg, president of securities research firm Pittsburg
Institutional of Little Neck, N.Y. Pittsburg has a 'buy on
weakness' rating for Aetna, meaning that he thinks it is a 'good
buy' under $70 a share.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea is that the sum of the parts are better than the
stock market valuation,'' Rex said.

   A team of physicists has made a giant leap in understanding the
prime scourge of audiences for opera, theater and concerts _ the
crinkling and crackling of candy wrappers.
</P>
<P>
   But their work will be scant help to audiences maddened by the
noise. The scientists demonstrated what plenty of dismayed
concertgoers have already intuited: the noise is inevitable no
matter how the candy is opened.

   The research, which will be presented on Friday in Atlanta at a
meeting of the Acoustical Society of America is the most detailed
examination ever of just how and why the mood-destroying noise is
generated in the kinds of materials that wrap candy.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers, Eric Kramer, a physicist at Simon's Rock
College in Great Barrington, Mass., and Alexander Lobkovsky of the
National Institute of Standards and Technology in Gaithersburg,
Md., asked themselves why even the most careful, painfully
deliberate extraction of a piece of hard candy from its wrapper
does not seem to reduce the amount of sound produced as a desperate
audience member tries to relieve a dry throat, invariably just as
Tosca reaches the sublime pathos of ``Vissi d'Arte.''
</P>
<P>
   By recording crinkled wrappers as they were slowly stretched in
an otherwise silent chamber, and then digitizing and analyzing the
sound emissions on computers, the researchers found that the noise
was not continuous, but consisted of individual bursts or pops just
thousandths of a second long. Their loudness, the researchers
discovered, has nothing to do with how fast wrapping is undone.
Rather, the pops occur at random volumes as tiny, individual
creases in the paper suddenly rearranged themselves during the
overall shape change _ as the candy is unwrapped.
</P>
<P>
   The physics of wrappers turned out to be surprisingly complex,
said Kramer, who found analogues in the conformation changes of
large protein molecules in the human body and the magnetic
properties of materials in computer memories.
</P>
<P>
   But because the series of minute shape changes from wrapped to
unwrapped is unavoidable, the experiment's practical implications
were tragic news for every alas-poor-Yorick moment of great drama.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can follow that sequence as slowly as you want, but each
step in the sequence is accompanied by a click,'' Kramer said.
``And there's nothing you can do about it.''
</P>
<P>
   On Broadway, where announced reminders to turn off cell phones
and beepers are accompanied by the suggestion that hard candy be
unwrapped before the curtain rises, the results may be about as
welcome as a bad review. But this parsing of the intricate behavior
of such a familiar object will find a ready audience among
scientists who study neither atomic nor cosmic realms, but rather
the physical middle ground between the very small and the very
large.
</P>
<P>
   Kramer said he no longer remembered exactly why he and Lobkovsky
began recording crinkling plastic. But he said that they became
intrigued by a fact that most people take for granted: smooth,
unwrinkled plastic has only one ``stable'' configuration, since no
matter how it is bent (as long as it is not creased), the plastic
will fall flat again. But crushed and wrinkled plastic has
innumerable stable states: deform it, and it holds the shape or
something close to it.
</P>
<P>
   So the researchers recorded the noises emitted during the slow
stretching of a common plastic that they had crushed and recrushed
many times. ``As far as we know, no one had ever looked at this
sound before,'' Kramer said.
</P>
<P>
   They were surprised to find an irregular series of extremely
brief pops with unpredictable energies that varied by a factor of a
million.
</P>
<P>
   In creating a theory of wrappers, the researchers found a
parallel in another common phenomenon, the rolling of a boulder
over a hilly, irregular landscape. Different wrapper conformations
correspond to the boulder's rolling into different depressions in
the landscape. And like a theatergoer gradually opening a wrapper,
someone might push the boulder very slowly up a hill. Nevertheless,
at some point it will tumble quickly down the other side, and, in
the case of the wrapper, emit that irritating snap.
</P>
<P>
   As homely as that process is, it has much in common a large drug
molecule that behaves differently in the body _ beneficially or
dangerously _ depending on what conformation it falls into, said
James Kakalios, a physicist at the University of Minnesota. ``If we
understood that, it would have a revolutionary impact on
everybody's life,'' since a new generation of therapeutic drugs
could be engineered, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But what does the research say about how to unwrap a piece of
hard candy when, horribly, a tickle in the throat arrives during
the final, fading bars of Tchaikovsky's ``Pathethique''?
</P>
<P>
   ``Unwrap it as quickly as possible and get it over with,''
Kramer said.

 &HT;    20 GROUPS CRITICIZE USDA OVER ALABAMA CHICKEN PLANTS
 &HT;    550&AMP;add.
 &HT;    By ELLIOT JASPIN
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ More than 20 public interest groups accused the
U.S. Agriculture Department on Thursday(cq) of trying to intimidate
its own food safety inspectors and ``misrepresenting'' conditions
at two poultry processing plants in Alabama.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to Thomas Billy, head of the Food Safety and
Inspection Service, the groups said the department ``thwarts the
public's right to know about the quality and safety of poultry
products'' and threatens ``the effectiveness and legitimacy of
public participation.''
</P>
<P>
   The letter, which was to be delivered Thursday, was provided in
advance to Cox Newspapers by one of its signers.
</P>
<P>
   The groups said federal officials started their campaign of
intimidation after Cox published a story Feb. 6 about conditions in
two Alabama poultry processing plants run by Gold Kist Inc. of
Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   The story quoted federal inspectors as saying that under an
experimental inspection program that allows companies to police
themselves, Gold Kist employees were not culling out diseased
birds.
</P>
<P>
   The inspectors said carcasses with scabs, sores and pus were cut
up and made into chicken nuggets that the federal government then
purchased and distributed to school lunch programs around the
nation.
</P>
<P>
   In their letter, the groups accused Billy of warning inspectors
after the story appeared that ``there may be some risks to those
that are involved'' in the news story. The letter also said Billy
asked the Agriculture Department's Office of Inspector General
(OIG) to find out if inspectors had given ``internal agency
documents'' to a reporter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your request of OIG constitutes the initiation of an illegal
retaliatory investigation,'' the letter says, ``because absent the
disclosures through the press, inspectors would not have been
placed under investigation.''
</P>
<P>
   The letter said the OIG investigation was abruptly terminated
four days after it began when the Government Accountability Project
(GAP), a public interest group in Washington that defends
whistle-blowers, questioned its legality.
</P>
<P>
   The probe was also supposed to determine if adulterated food was
reaching consumers.
</P>
<P>
   But the letter said that even after learning from the OIG and
its own administrators that allegedly adulterated product was being
shipped to consumers, the agency ``misrepresented its own and the
OIG's findings'' to the public. They cited a press release by Billy
saying food from the plant was ``safe and wholesome.''
</P>
<P>
   The letter was written by Felicia Nestor, who heads GAP's food
safety program. Nestor said that she asked the heads of other
public interest groups to sign the letter. As of Wednesday
afternoon, Nestor said, representatives of 24 groups had done so.
They ranged from Washington-based Public Citizen, headed by Joan
Claybrook, former administrator of the National Highway Traffic
Safety Administration, to the Western Nebraska Resources Council.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the most influential food safety groups in Washington,
the Consumer Federation of America (CFA) and the Center for Science
in the Public Interest (CPSI), were not among those signing. Nestor
said Wednesday afternoon that she had not received a reply from
CSPI, and that the CFA had declined to sign. A spokesman for the
CFA was not available for comment.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Also signing the letter were the Cattlemen's Legal Fund, the
U.S. Public Interest Research Group, the Center for Environmental
Health, the New York-New Jersey Environmental Watch, Connecticut
Opposed to Waste, the Global Resource Action Center for the
Environment, the Vashon Island Growers Association, Consumers
United for Food Safety and Consumer's Voice.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the Citizens Awareness Network, the Prairie Island
Coalition, the North American Water Office, Don't Waste Arizona
Inc., Earthroot Education, the Center for Food Safety, the
California Safe Food Coalition, the Aspartame Consumer Safety
Network and Pilot Hotline, the Community Nutrition Institute, the
law firm of Marler Clark, the Organic Consumers Association and the
Center for Media and Democracy.

55-YEAR-OLD CASE OF THREE DEAD MARINES RAISES ISSUE OF POSTWAR
RAPES IN OKINAWA

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NAGO, Japan _ Shortly before the end of World War II, just after
the United States won the brutal battle for Okinawa, three U.S.
Marines stationed in this sun-drenched archipelago disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   At first, the Marine Corps listed the three, all 19 years old
and black, as possible deserters in the summer of 1945. A year
later, when there was still no trace of them, they were declared
missing in action.
</P>
<P>
   For five decades, the case was forgotten. Then in 1998, the
local police, acting on a tip, discovered what proved to be the
bones of the three Marines in a cave just north of this resort
town. After long examinations the remains were sent to relatives in
the United States for burial early this year.
</P>
<P>
   But the discovery did little to solve the mystery of the
Marines' disappearance and, far from putting the case to rest,
dredged up powerful local resentment about how Americans treated
Okinawans after the fighting stopped.
</P>
<P>
   Some elderly Okinawans, who grew up near where the remains were
found, are now willing to tell a long-held secret: A group of
villagers ambushed and killed the three Marines, believing they
were the three black Marines who the villagers believed had
repeatedly come to the village to rape the village women.
</P>
<P>
   While much of what the Okinawans said about those painful days
after the war ended is corroborated, it has not been proved that
these three Marines committed any rape. Nor has it been confirmed
that the villagers in fact killed the soldiers, although there is
strong evidence that they did.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the villagers' tale of a dark, long-kept secret has
refocused attention on what historians say is one of the most
widely ignored crimes of the war, the widespread rape of Okinawan
women by U.S. servicemen.
</P>
<P>
   Much has been written and debated about atrocities that
Okinawans suffered at the hands of both the Americans and Japanese
in one of the deadliest battles of the war. More than 200,000
soldiers and civilians, including one-third of the population of
Okinawa, were killed in the fighting.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, there was scant mention of rape. But by one
academic's estimate, as many as 10,000 Okinawan women may have been
raped and rape was so prevalent that most Okinawans over age 65
either know or have heard of a woman who was raped in the aftermath
of the war.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have read many accounts of such rapes in Okinawan newspapers
and books, but few people know about them or are willing to talk
about them,'' said Steve Rabson, a professor of East Asian Studies
at Brown University, who is an expert on Okinawa.
</P>
<P>
   Marine Corps officials in Okinawa and Washington said that they
knew of no rapes by U.S. servicemen in Okinawa at the end of the
war, and their records do not list war crimes committed by Marines
in Okinawa.
</P>
<P>
   Gen. John G. Castellaw, deputy commander of the Marine force in
Okinawa, said that during the past 30 years, in which he completed
numerous assignments on the island, he had never heard of any
accusations of widespread rape by U.S. servicemen in Okinawa.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Times tried to contact surviving members of the
segregated 37th Marine Depot Unit, to which the three dead Marines
were attached. But the Montford Point Marine Association, a
veterans group representing the Marines who were trained at
Montford Point, N.C., said it could not locate any veterans willing
to be interviewed.
</P>
<P>
   Samuel Saxton, a retired captain who is the association's
immediate past president, said in a telephone interview that it was
important to learn the truth about the Marines' deaths and whether
Americans committed rapes in Okinawa. But he said he feared that
black Marines who served there, and made up only a part of the
Americans stationed on Okinawa, would be wrongly painted with a
broad brush.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be unfair for the public to get the impression that
we were all a bunch of rapists after we worked so hard to serve our
country,'' he said. Books, diaries, articles and other documents
refer to rapes by U.S. soldiers of various races and backgrounds.
</P>
<P>
   Masaie Ishihara, a sociology professor at the Okinawa
International University, said ``there is a lot of historical
amnesia out there'' about those traumatic postwar years. He said
that ``many people don't want to acknowledge what really
happened.''
</P>
<P>
   One possible explanation for why the U.S. military says it has
no record of any rapes is that few if any Okinawan women reported
being attacked out of fear and embarrassment, and that those who
did were ignored by the U.S. military police, the historians said.
Moreover, there has never been a large-scale effort to determine
the real extent of such crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Even today, efforts to speak to women who had been raped were
rejected because friends, local historians and university
professors who had spoken with the women said they preferred not to
discuss it publicly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Victimized women feel too ashamed to make it public, and
criminals who killed the three Marines are afraid,'' said a police
spokesman in the nearby city of Nago.
</P>
<P>
   In his book ``Tennozan: The Battle of Okinawa and the Atomic
Bomb,'' (Ticknor &AMP; Fields, 1992) George Feifer said that there were
fewer than 10 cases of rape reported by 1946 in Okinawa, ``partly
because of shame and disgrace, partly because Americans were
victors and occupiers.'' Feifer said that ``in all there were
probably thousands of incidents, but the victims' silence kept rape
another dirty secret of the campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   In interviews, historians and Okinawans said that some Okinawan
women who were raped gave birth to biracial children, many of whom
were killed at birth. More often, however, rape victims obtained
abortions from village midwives.
</P>
<P>
   The first published account in English of the discovery of the
remains of the three Marines appeared in The Pacific Stars and
Stripes in 1998 shortly after the remains were retrieved. In the
article, an Okinawan man who would not give his name said that as a
child growing up after the war in Katsuyama, the remote mountain
village where the remains were found, he heard village elders talk
of an incident involving the U.S. Marines.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In separate interviews with The Times, elderly Okinawans who
also grew up in the village, said that after the United States won
the battle, three armed Marines would come to Katsuyama every
weekend and force the village men to take them to their women, who
were then carried off to the hills and raped.
</P>
<P>
   The Marines were so confident, the villagers said, that they
would sometimes come to Katsuyama without weapons. One day, the
villagers, with the help of two armed Japanese soldiers who were
hiding in the jungle, ambushed three Marines in a dark narrow
mountain pass near a river, they said. The Japanese soldiers shot
at the Marines from the bushes and several dozen villagers beat
them to death with sticks and stones.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't see the actual killing because I was hiding in the
mountains above, but I heard five or six gunshots and then a lot of
footsteps and commotion,'' said Shinsei Higa, a 71-year-old retired
teacher, who was 16 at the time. ``By late afternoon, we came down
from the mountains and then everyone knew what had happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Fearing that other Americans would come looking for the Marines,
the villagers dumped the bodies in a hillside cave, which has a
50-foot drop just inside the mouth, and they vowed never to speak
of the incident to outsiders, the Okinawans said.
</P>
<P>
   Kijun Kishimoto, an 84-year-old retired school principal who
grew up in Katsuyama, said that he was away from the village when
the killings took place but that he learned of the incident from
his older brother and niece.
</P>
<P>
   ``People were very afraid that if the Americans found out what
happened there would be retaliation, so they decided to keep it a
secret to protect those involved,'' Kishimoto said. ``They did
everything possible to cover it up, including removing the
bloodstained soil and washing the ground with river water before
the Americans came.''
</P>
<P>
   Okinawans who lived in Katsuyama, said the three Marines who
harassed their village were ``black Americans'' and that one was
``as large as a sumo wrestler.'' The cave, which is on a steep
slope above a valley along a narrow river is known to local
residents in Japanese as ``kurombo gama,'' which means Cave of the
Negroes.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. military officials said that based on dental records, the
remains recovered in the cave were positively identified as those
of the three missing Marines. They were Pfc. James D. Robinson of
Savannah, Ga., Pfc. John M. Smith of Cincinnati, and Pvt. Isaac
Stokes of Chicago. The Stars and Stripes article said that a guilty
conscience led the Okinawan man to contact Setsuko Inafuku, a tour
guide for Kadena U.S. Air Base in Okinawa, who had been involved in
retrieving the remains of Okinawan and Japanese soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   Inafuku said in an interview that she and the Okinawan man began
searching for the cave in June 1997 but had no luck finding it
until a typhoon struck the island in August and knocked over a tree
that hid the entrance to the cave. In September the police were
notified but they agreed not to remove the remains for several
months so that the person who had led to the discovery could remain
anonymous.
</P>
<P>
   Marine Corps officials said that the U.S. military did not plan
to conduct a criminal investigation since the remains were
discovered outside a military installation and were under the
jurisdiction of the Okinawa Prefectural Police. The prefectural
police has said that it has no plans to investigate because the
statute of limitations on such a case expired after 15 years.

   MORADABAD, India _ Way back when _ or, to be more precise, way,
way, way back when _ an illiterate meat cutter, Abdul Waheed, filed
a lawsuit against his next-door-neighbor, a stubborn milk merchant
named Mohammad Nanhe.
</P>
<P>
   The milkman had built a brick wall at the edge of his property,
inserting two small drains that emptied into Waheed's front yard.
Though only rainwater escaped from the spouts, the meat cutter was
furious. He had hopes of adding a third room to his modest cement
house. With those new drains loomed the probability of irksome
seepage.
</P>
<P>
   Quite appallingly, though not so atypically, that was 39 years
and several hundred court dates ago. Waheed and Nanhe are long
dead, but their litigation has plodded onward, moving with all the
speed of a creaky bullock cart through perhaps the most
overburdened justice system in the world. Those troublesome drains,
while promptly ruled illegal, have remained open while the case
moseys along on appeal.
</P>
<P>
   If, as the adage goes, justice delayed is justice denied, then
India's courts can be said to customarily live in a state of
denial. Some 25 million cases are pending, a breath-taking pileup
of the untried accused and unsatisfied aggrieved. By one expert's
calculation, if no new actions are filed, 324 years would be needed
to clear the dockets.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are a poor country, immersed in debt, and it takes money to
get more courthouses, equipment and staff,'' said Ram Jethmalani,
the nation's law minister. ``I'm told we need five times as many
judges, but I don't know where we'd put them.''
</P>
<P>
   Here in Moradabad, a city 110 miles east of New Delhi and the
loci of Waheed vs. Nanhe, the courtrooms are spare and shabby, with
bare light bulbs, broken furniture and overtaxed ceiling fans.
Frayed wires dangle like old yarn from peeling yellow walls.

   Outside, under trees, documents are produced by men hunched over
manual typewriters; copies are made with carbon paper. Lawyers work
out of open stalls, the more prominent ones laying claim to space
with a roof, others merely posting a sign amid the weeds. Cows and
goats, much like the plaintiffs and defendants, wander around
listlessly, trying to evade the sun. Water is drawn from a hand
pump above a tube well.

<P>
   Proceedings go slowly, if at all. Not all judges or lawyers are
persnickety about attendance. Each day, a list of about 50 cases is
posted in every courtroom, leaving a crowd of attorneys and clients
waiting at the rear of the chamber like frustrated diners at an
overbooked restaurant. Most scheduled business is inevitably
postponed.
</P>
<P>
   Court clerks wield immense power, inching forward a paper flow
that would otherwise be entirely stagnant. For each service, a
bribe of 10 rupees _about 25 cents _ is an expected courtesy, given
and accepted without camouflage. This is known as ``speed money,''
though it would more accurate to call it a ``somewhat-less-slow
toll.''
</P>
<P>
   Like attorneys worldwide, the ones here have alert eyes, wide as
checkbooks. But while some are highly paid and masterful, the vast
majority earn about $2,000 to $3,000 a year. They commonly enter
the profession because their test scores are low.
</P>
<P>
   ``Law college is the easiest to get into,'' said Rajesh Talwar,
author of several books about the court system. ``If you can't
become an engineer, you become a lawyer.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever an attorney's skills, they are all proficient dawdlers.
Continuances are easily granted by overwhelmed judges, and lawyers
quickly learn the art of delay _ the well-timed absence, the
challenge to routine paperwork, the misplacement of evidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Barring expedited circumstances, it's unlikely a civil case
would come to a decision in less than 10 years,'' said A.M. Ahmadi,
a former chief justice of the Supreme Court who has written with
exasperation about the legal backlog.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need systemic change _ and more judges. In India, 75
percent of all cases go to trial, but the ratio of judges to the
population is 10 or 12 per million. In the West, it's 50 to 100 per
million. And many of our judges don't have the best of work
habits.''

   Much of Indian law is a ponderous holdover from the British

   Recently, the government proposed new limits on adjournments and
appeals, but lawyers considered this an abridgment of rights and,
like outraged longshoremen, they are a group prone to go on strike.
In response to these and other changes, they boycotted the courts
in late February and protested in the streets of New Delhi. Police
considered them unruly and attacked them with bamboo clubs and
water canons.

<P>
   That mayhem was front-page news, a rare flash of limelight for
the anemic courts. As a rule, judicial delays only make for novelty
items in the press, with antique cases yielding stories of the
ironic and the sad and the preposterous.
</P>
<P>
   Last December, 75-year-old Ajay Ghosh was released from a
Calcutta jail after waiting 37 years to be tried on murder charges.
In 1963, a doctor had found him to be of unsound mind. The case was
then shelved and Ghosh forgotten. The charges are now unlikely to
be pursued. The witnesses and investigating officer are all dead.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is an astounding thing, how often people in this country go
on trial after they have already served the maximum sentence for
their alleged crime,'' said a lawyer, Sankar Sen, who studied the
courts for the National Commission on Human Rights. ``Of course,
the poor are at a disadvantage. They are the ones who cannot afford
to put down bail.''
</P>
<P>
   India has a low crime rate. In a nation of 1 billion people,
only 325,000 are in prison, although a mere 25 percent of those
inmates have been convicted of a crime, according to the
commission's statistics. The rest are ``undertrials,'' awaiting
their day in court.
</P>
<P>
   The wait, which can often be years, is especially troubling
because the ``acquittal rate is almost 90 percent,'' said Ahmadi,
the retired chief justice.

   L.K. Advani, the nation's home minister and one of its most
powerful politicians, recently won an acquittal. He had been
accused of improperly changing his voter registration. While he
served no jail time, the case did hang over his head for 18 years.
Afterward, he said his faith in India's justice system had been
reaffirmed.

<P>
   Despite its sluggishness, the judicial system generally
maintains the faith of the masses. They show their trust, voting
their approval by filing ever-more cases.
</P>
<P>
   Presumably, Abdul Waheed, the meat cutter, had faith when he
sued to have those annoying drains removed in 1961. But with the
scales of justice still teetering, he died in 1980. His son,
Mohammad Umar, inherited the case and died in 1988. Umar's sister,
Niazni Begum, the next heir, died in 1997. The two-room house, as
well as the lawsuit, now belongs to her nephew, Abdul Wazid,
himself a meat cutter.
</P>
<P>
   Wazid's current attorney is Prem Saran Mathur, a beaten-down
old-timer who accepted the case in perpetuity for a $45 fee.
Recently, looking back on his 42 years as an attorney, he glumly
summed it up: ``There is no justice in India. The judges don't
care. They work maybe three or four hours a day.''
</P>
<P>
   Like other advocates, Mathur wears a black jacket and a white
cardboard tie, something of an official uniform. He keeps the
Waheed vs. Nanhe case file in his outdoor stall, which is notable
in this milieu for having two chairs as well as a bench. The olive
green folder itself is wilted and torn, held together with a
shoelace.
</P>
<P>
   Waheed vs. Nanhe would seem to be a straightforward matter, and
indeed the court decided in Waheed's favor in 1963. Objections were
filed by Nanhe, and when those were rejected in 1966, the decision
was appealed to the high court in Allahabad.
</P>
<P>
   There the case waited 13 years for a hearing, which would have
been fine if the paperwork had only been allowed to gather dust.
Instead, after the lawsuit's 15th birthday in 1976, a clerk
performed his statutory obligation and ``weeded out'' the
less-important documents. At the hearing, the judge then ruled he
lacked enough information to decide.
</P>
<P>
   For the past 21 years, the case has been back in the lower
court, which has been ordered to reconstruct the file. Each piece
of paper is open to challenge, an invitation for delays that makes
the defense attorney, Sunil Kumar Rastogi, grin at the thought of
it, his mouth opening wide to show teeth stained red from an
overindulgence of betel juice.
</P>
<P>
   ``The file will never be complete,'' he said confidently.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the case appears on the docket once or twice each
month only to be adjourned for this or postponed for that. From
1979 to 1990, 15 hearing dates were wasted by lawyer strikes and 13
more when the judge took an unscheduled holiday.
</P>
<P>
   Every time, the case is scheduled, both the plaintiff and
defendant feel obliged to go to court. Clients cannot depend on
their lawyers to show up, and, if no one is present, the lawsuit
may be forfeited entirely.
</P>
<P>
   It is a cumbersome burden for Wazid, who has meat to cut and
customers waiting. He is a bony, gray-haired man. On occasion, he
meets his opponent in court and they shout at each other. That
would no longer be Nanhe, who died in 1986. His son, Tahir
Mohammad, now carries the burden of the bequeathed litigation.
</P>
<P>
   Mohammad is a chain-smoking man, easy to anger. His wife talks
to the Wazids and even uses their refrigerator. The women try to be
neighborly.
</P>
<P>
   But the men are prideful and snappish. While Wazid bears
legitimate concerns about the free use of his land, the matter is
more one of honor for Mohammad: No one tells  &UR; his &LR;  family where to
put their drains.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will fight this case forever,'' he commented loudly, not
just demonstrating his determination but, most likely, offering a
reasonable prediction of when the lawsuit may end.

CLINTON AND EUROPEAN OFFICIALS MAKE NO PROGRESS IN TRADE TALKS 
</HEADLINE>
   By ELAINE SCIOLINO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LISBON, Portugal _ President Clinton and senior European Union
officials met Wednesday on four major trade disputes dividing them
but did not make any progress, a senior administration official
said .
</P>
<P>
   The trade issues were apparently so difficult that Clinton,
Romano Prodi, president of the Union Commission, and Portuguese
Prime Minister Antonio Guterres, who currently holds the rotating
European Union presidency, did not even make a serious attempt to
resolve them.
</P>
<P>
   They spent 20 minutes of their 75-minute working meeting at the
Queluz Palace, an 18th century small-scale version of Versailles
outside of Lisbon, on trade. The rest was devoted to Russia and
security issues like Kosovo and European defense. Their hour-long
working lunch focused on economic issues like commerce on the
Internet and infectious diseases.
</P>
<P>
   In an unusually blunt public assessment for such a high-level
meeting, Lael Brainard, the deputy national economic adviser, made
no effort to put a positive spin on it.
</P>
<P>
   Briefing reporters, she described the trade talks as ``a lively
and frank exchange on areas where our views differ.'' Asked
specifically whether any progress had been made on any outstanding
issues, Brainard said, ``There was no progress at this meeting.''
Wednesday's meetings, on the first stop of Clinton's last scheduled
trip to Europe as president, underscored how little time Clinton
has to shape foreign policy before he leaves office in eight
months.
</P>
<P>
   A joint news conference was held in the formal garden of the
palace after the meetings.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In his opening remarks, Clinton struck a retrospective note,
saying he wanted to put Wednesday's meeting into ``some historical
perspective.'' He listed what he called Europe's achievements in
promoting democracy and economic prosperity during the past eight
years. ``I thank all of those who have supported those
developments,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   In emotional words of his own, the effusive Prodi said that he
wanted to ``pay tribute'' to Clinton's support of the European
Union during his administration. Italy's former prime minister said
it was fitting that Clinton would receive the Charlemagne Prize
later this week, an award given to those who promote Europe's
goals. Clinton is ``a European,'' Prodi said, adding, ``You belong
to our family, really.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it was the blinding sun in Clinton's eyes that made him
blink as Prodi spoke. In the afternoon, Clinton played golf for
several hours with his national security adviser, Sandy Berger, on
a world-class golf course just outside of Lisbon.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In the news conference, Clinton spent most of his time fielding
questions on subjects other than trade.
</P>
<P>
   In his most extensive remarks on the withdrawal of Israeli
troops from Lebanon, Clinton called the withdrawal decision by
Prime Minister Ehud Barak of Israel ``daring.'' He added, ``It
changed the landscape.'' But Clinton also warned that the
withdrawal ``imposes a much greater sense of urgency'' on all the
parties to agree to a blueprint that is supposed to lead to a
permanent peace agreement by mid-September. Israel and the
Palestinians are still grappling with unresolved issues like the
fate of Jerusalem, Jewish settlements on occupied land, borders and
the future of around 4 million Palestinian refugees.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is both greater potential for something happening and
also greater tension in the atmosphere,'' Clinton said, ``which is
causing a ripple effect in the relationship between the Israelis
and the Palestinians.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton confirmed that a private meeting he will have with
Barak, originally scheduled for Berlin, had been switched to Lisbon
on Thursday morning at the request of Barak, who, in the face of
domestic opposition, decided he needed to be in the country for a
state ceremony marking Jerusalem Unification Day.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who is scheduled to leave for Germany later on
Thursday, also spoke by telephone with the Palestinian leader,
Yasser Arafat. ``President Clinton emphasized a commitment to do
everything he can to move the process forward,'' a senior
administration official said.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Asked at the news conference about a U.S. plan to develop a
limited missile defense, which has been much criticized by
America's European partners, Clinton reiterated his view that the
United States faces a new nuclear threat and would be willing to
share its technology with other ``civilized nations.''
</P>
<P>
   If the technology for such a system is developed, Clinton said,
``it would be unethical,'' for the United States to hoard the
technology.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's proposal to modify the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile
Treaty to allow for the deployment of a limited missile defense
system as well as Russia's conduct in the war in Chechnya will be
at the top of the agenda when he meets during the weekend in Moscow
with Russia's president, Vladimir Putin, for the first time. Putin
has vociferously opposed amending the treaty, a landmark of cold
war arms control.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've done a lot of information sharing already with the
Russians,'' Clinton said. ``We've offered to do more.''
</P>
<P>
   The Europeans are not sanguine about a modification of the
treaty either.
</P>
<P>
   Guterres, Portugal's prime minister, said Wednesday that any
move toward a missile-defense system would have to be agreed to
``by everybody'' and would have to take into account ``everyone's
preoccupations in this matter.''
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, President Jacques Chirac of France said he was
worried that the missile defense system would spark a new global
arms race.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton played down the prospects for any major breakthrough in
Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would be surprised if we bridge all of our differences on
Chechnya, and I would be surprised if we resolved all our
differences on the question of missile defense, although we might
make more headway than most people expect,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As for trade, trade between the United States and the 15-member
European Union represents more than 40 percent of the world's
share, but the two sides are locked in a protracted and public
struggle over a series of conflicts in which neither side has shown
much willingness to compromise.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. side objects to European restrictions on the
importation of bananas, a ban on U.S. beef produced with growth
hormones and subsidizing by European governments of a new
double-decker Airbus.
</P>
<P>
   More recently, the European Union has objected to a tax break
that the United States grants to major corporations that set up
operations in offshore tax havens like the Virgin Islands and
Barbados. These companies are not required to pay U.S. sales tax
and duties _ from 10 to 30 percent _ on their exports. The European
Union argues that the tax relief that benefits 6,000 exporters,
including such corporate giants as Boeing, General Motors and
Microsoft is a form of subsidy that will amount to about $25
billion to U.S. companies during the next five years.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the European Union's position on bananas and beef,
the World Trade Organization has allowed the United States to
impose more than $300 million in import penalties against the
European Union. The Europeans are infuriated by the U.S.
retaliatory import tax on goods such as Roquefort cheese and foie
gras.

AFRICAN IDENTITY? AN ART SHOW TURNS THE TABLES 
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVID HECHT    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAKAR, Senegal _ It started in the early years of the 20th
century, when the Cubists broke down their subject matter in ways
that resembled African masks. Later Surrealists, Expressionists and
even Pop artists took visual ideas and concepts from Africa. Now
contemporary African artists are appropriating their traditions
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   That is the raison d'etre for the fifth Dak'Art, Senegal's
Pan-African biennial of art, being held here through Monday. This
former French colony, which the United Nations counts among the
world's least developed nations, has diverted almost $1 million
from basic human services and from paying off its vast foreign debt
to bring 47 artists here from 18 African countries and critics and
curators from around the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``Development is not just about having enough to eat,'' said
Remi Sagna, director of Dak'Art, which has taken over museums and
public spaces throughout the capital. ``We are making a long-term
investment in our culture.''
</P>
<P>
   The dividend, as he sees it, is twofold. ``Art projects more
complex images of who we are than the conflict and misery shown in
the international press,'' he said. The other benefit is money:
``If African artists could command high prices, it would be a boom
to our economies.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that the artworks are all an easy sell. Many of the works on
view here are highly conceptual. In a simple, elegant installation
a Senegalese artist, Soly Cisse, drapes mosquito netting, weighed
down by pillows, from a wall. Samuel Fosso, a photographer from the
Central African Republic, presents studio portraits of himself in
often unflattering outfits. The Ghanaian photographer Essien Mfon
presents images of imperfect naked African bodies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dak'Art is not meant to be a postcard vision of Africa,'' said
Jean-Charles Tall, an architect who is a member of the biennial's
organizing committee. ``It is a serious attempt by Africans to
reflect life through art.''
</P>
<P>
   Representation in African art has always been largely symbolic.
Giving cultural meaning to found objects, as the European Dadaists
did in the 1910s, or to raw materials, as Arte Povera did in Italy
in the 1960s, is the kind of leap of faith common in African
spiritual practices.
</P>
<P>
   But ``for Westerners, modern art is a revolt against the past,''
said the spokesman for Dak'Art, Oussanou Gueye. ``Africans don't
generally have these complexes.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, African intellectuals have long been trying to figure out
how their connection to Western modernism could be of benefit to
Africans in the real world. One of the earliest was Leopold
Senghor, Senegal's poet and first president, who lived in Paris in
the early 20th century and associated with artists there. When
Picasso once told him, ``We must remain savages,'' he replied, ``We
must remain Negroes.''
</P>
<P>
   In the 1930s Senghor became a leading member of the Negritude
movement, a heady group of French-speaking black writers affirming
traditional African culture and values and rejecting the French
policy of assimilation. He proclaimed that in the postcolonial
world order Africans would be the artists because ``emotion is
African,'' while ``reason is Hellenic.''
</P>
<P>
   When Senghor was elected president upon Senegal's independence
in 1960, he built schools for the arts, a grand concert hall, and
the Musee Dynamique for contemporary art. Senegalese schoolchildren
in the farthest-flung villages were taught African history and
culture as well as modernist art and theory. With generous
government support for the arts, many became artists.
</P>
<P>
   They produced thousands of rectangular semiabstract paintings
with colorful brush strokes that were painfully imitative and
repetitive. None of the artists became famous in the West, or even
in Senegal. When the technocrat Abdou Diouf became president in
1980, support for the arts dried up, and the Musee Dynamique was
emptied of its artworks and turned into the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   Hopes for an African ``modern'' art seemed all but dashed.
``African culture is only a raw material for the West,'' said an
official who worked at the Ministry of Culture at the time. ``It's
like cocoa, which grows in Africa, but when you try to make
chocolate from it here it melts. And that's what happened to
Senegal's dream.''
</P>
<P>
   With the first biennial in 1993, a spark again flickered, with a
difference. The artists and critics to emerge do not have the
utopian vision of Senghor's generation. ``They are less concerned
about being rooted in their culture,'' Gueye said of the Senegalese
artists in this year's Dak'Art.
</P>
<P>
   He gave the example of a sculpture by Ndary Lo consisting of a
giant iron stick figure wrapped in white thread in such a way that
it looks like a traditionally Senegalese long white gown. ``For me
the contrast of luxurious cloth against junk metal resonates with
the way toughness and refinement sit side by side in Senegal,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Dak'Art grand prix is named after Senghor, and his legacy
continues. Some Senegalese artists not included in the official
biennial have built an ``art village'' of mud-and-straw huts next
to the city's giant stadium (also named after Senghor), where they
say they are creating a more authentic modern African art. They
call their exhibition ``Dak'Art Off.''
</P>
<P>
   The biennial doesn't seem to have an overall philosophy other
than including as many different types of contemporary visual
culture as possible. Since 1998 the biennials have included
sections for fabric makers and furniture designers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We no longer believe in trying to distinguish between high and
low culture in Africa,'' Sagna said. ``One way or another all art
is functional, and there is nothing wrong with it's being
popular.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly the work does not have to look ``African.'' The most
successful Senegalese artist in recent years, Ousmane Sow, a member
of the show's organizing committee, is a realist sculptor whose
installations resemble theme parks; the themes are not always
related to Africa. One of his installations, shown last year in
Paris, tells the story of the Battle of Little Big Horn.
</P>
<P>
   This year's Dak'Art will be seen in the West for the first time.
It is to travel to France later this year, and organizers are
trying to persuade curators at the Studio Museum in Harlem to bring
it to the United States.

INVENSYS TO BUY DUTCH SOFTWARE MAKER
</HEADLINE>
 By ALAN COWELL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Invensys PLC, a British manufacturer of factory
controls, agreed on Wednesday to buy Baan NV for $802 million,
promising to turn around the company, a Dutch software maker that
has relentlessly lost money and share value for nearly two years.
</P>
<P>
   Baan, once seen as one of Europe's most promising technology
companies, has been looking for a buyer since January, when Mary
Coleman, the chief executive, and a string of other senior managers
resigned. Lazard Freres &AMP; Co., the investment bank, was retained to
look for a buyer.
</P>
<P>
   Founded 22 years ago by two entrepreneurial brothers, Jan and
Paul Baan, the company expanded steadily until April 1998, when new
accounting rules forced it to defer revenue from licensing. The
company subsequently reported a series of quarterly losses, and its
shares lost nearly 90 percent of their value. In May, Baan shares
reached a low of 1.26 euros, or about $1.18, on fear the company
would seek bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Baan shares rose 13 percent, to 2.97 euros, or
about $2.79, on word of the Invensys deal. Investors punished
Invensys, however, driving down its share price 13 percent, to 230
pence, or about $3.45. With Wednesday's losses, Invensys stock has
fallen 32 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
   Invensys said it would pay 2.85 euros in cash for each Baan
share and assume $65 million in debt. The price represented an 8.8
percent premium on the Dutch company's closing price on Tuesday in
Amsterdam of 2.62 euros.
</P>
<P>
   Allen Yurko, chief executive of Invensys, said the acquisition
fitted the Invensys' ``vision to create the leading industrial
software company,'' offering products to link factories to
customers, suppliers and workers on the factory floor. He said Baan
would return to profitability within a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have turned around numerous software companies,'' Yurko
said. ``We have done it before.'' He acknowledged disappointment
about the stock market's reaction to the deal, but said the
combination represented ``the right thing for the long-term value
of the group.''
</P>
<P>
   Invensys, based in London, was created in February 1999 by the
merger of Siebe and BTR, which specialized in automation and
controls that enabled companies to monitor manufacturing.
</P>
<P>
   Yurko said Baan would continue to operate under its own name as
part of a new Invensys software and systems division, expected to
generate annual sales of $2 billion.

PHILHARMONIC APPOINTING ZARIN MEHTA AS EXECUTIVE 
</HEADLINE>
   By RALPH BLUMENTHAL    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The New York Philharmonic said Wednesday that it was
naming Zarin Mehta, who runs Chicago's prestigious Ravinia
Festival, to be its executive director starting in September.
</P>
<P>
   As the orchestra's top administrative official, Mehta will
supervise its business operations and bookings. He succeeds Deborah
Borda, who became executive vice president and managing director of
the Los Angeles Philharmonic late last year.
</P>
<P>
   The official announcement, set for Thursday, does not include
the naming of a successor to Kurt Masur as the orchestra's music
director. Riccardo Muti, music director of La Scala Opera, is the
Philharmonic's leading choice for the position, which will become
vacant in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Mehta, 61, whose brother, Zubin, was the music director of the
Philharmonic for a record 13 years until 1991, said Wednesday that
he and the orchestra's chairman, Paul B. Guenther, had met with
Muti in Milan last week and that the two looked forward to working
together as a team. ``He's very interested in the New York
Philharmonic,'' Mehta said. But he said that contract terms
remained to be worked out and that Muti's representative, David
Foster, was in Milan now meeting with his client.
</P>
<P>
   Guenther said that discussions were continuing with Muti, 58.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing imminent, but it's definitely moving in the
right direction,'' Guenther said.
</P>
<P>
   Although some orchestra members thought the two appointments
might be made simultaneously, Guenther said, ``There was never any
plan to announce them together.'' The orchestra leaves on a
European tour on Monday, and nothing will be announced before its
return on June 30, he said.
</P>
<P>
   He denied that the talks had hit a snag over salary or Muti's
commitments to the Vienna Philharmonic and the Berlin Philharmonic,
which he regularly conducts, in addition to La Scala. ``It's
proceeding in a professional fashion,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Last week Muti was quoted in an Agence France-Presse article
from Milan as saying that the Philharmonic post ``is very
available'' but that ``it's me who must make a decision, and before
accepting I must find the right balance between various
obligations.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   One Lincoln Center official said that the orchestra, smitten as
it was with Muti after his visits as a guest conductor, was seeking
assurance that he would continue Masur's attachment to New York
``and not just fly in and out.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a strong feeling this is a marriage, not an affair,''
the official said.
</P>
<P>
   Mehta was one of 40 candidates offered by the recruiting firm of
Spencer Stuart &AMP; Associates, but he quickly topped the list,
Guenther said. ``We were told the best is Zarin Mehta, but you'll
never get him,'' he said. He called Mehta ``the best executive
director in the country.''
</P>
<P>
   Mehta, since 1990 president and chief executive officer of
Ravinia, the open-air music festival in Highland Park, near
Chicago, the Chicago Symphony Orchestra's summer home since 1936,
said that his appointment, given his family's history, was ``an
extraordinary move for me.'' In addition to his brother's
involvement with the Philharmonic, his father, Mehli Mehta, a
violinist and conductor, studied in New York in the 1940s. A
cousin, Bejun Mehta, is a countertenor who as a boy soprano sang
for Leonard Bernstein.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Zarin Mehta, who was born in Bombay, entered the
music world as an accountant. Trained in England, he sought an
accounting job in New York in 1962 but was turned away for fear he
might head back to Europe or go to Canada to escape the Vietnam-era
draft. He did move to Canada to work for the accounting firm of
Coopers &AMP; Lybrand and joined the board of the Montreal Symphony
Orchestra, becoming its vice president. In 1981 he was named
managing director and served until 1990, when he took over the
Ravinia Festival.
</P>
<P>
   His musical training was nil, he said proudly. ``My parents
successfully kept me away from it,'' he said. For his
administrative duties, he said, ``accounting is better than being
an oboe player.'' He said he looked forward to working with Masur
and, if plans jelled, with Muti. ``It's a very strange marriage,
music director and executive director,'' he said. ``They're jointly
responsible. They have to be thinking along the same lines.''
</P>
<P>
   Could he have worked with his brother, Zubin? He didn't pause to
consider it. ``We would have fought tooth and nail,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As for his plans for changes at the Philharmonic, he said it
would be presumptuous to speak of that yet. But he had one
priority. ``I want to attend a parks concert,'' he said.

   &UR; BY MICHAEL KINSLEY &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This Memorial Day, like all of them for 35 years, our thoughts
about American soldiers and our debates about when and where their
lives should be put at risk were dominated by the contrast between
World War II and Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   Almost everyone at the time and ever since has agreed that WWII
was the good war. Vietnam, at the time and ever since, was either
an immorally extended mistake or a worthy cause betrayed (or dozens
of variations on these themes).
</P>
<P>
   But another difference between WWII and Vietnam is usually
overlooked, although it explains a lot. WWII involved mobilization
of the entire society. Most young and not-so-young adult men served
in the military or in some other way.
</P>
<P>
   Vietnam, by contrast, even at its peak required only a small
fraction of a narrower draft-age cohort. Although the draft was
supposed to be universal, four-fifths of draft-age males did no
military service and nine-tenths never saw Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   This mundane statistical reality explains much more than moral
opposition or cowardice does about why, when Vietnam-age men pop up
in the news, they usually seem to have avoided Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   The future occasions when Americans may be called on to fight
and die are sure to resemble Vietnam more than WWII: Their
necessity will be debatable, and they will require the service of
only a small minority. That makes WWII an almost useless model,
politically.
</P>
<P>
   One thing democracy does best is mobilizing a whole society
toward a transcendently important goal. One thing democracy does
very badly, though, is allocating unequal sacrifice. When some are
asked to fight and die while most get to continue the flow of their
lives, war and peace becomes the ultimate NIMBY
(not-in-my-back-yard) problem.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it is no bad thing if military escapades become as
politically hopeless as a nuclear power plant. But the essence of
NIMBY is that something cannot happen politically even with
majority support, if it imposes an unfair burden on a few.
</P>
<P>
   Since Vietnam we have tried two solutions: the draft lottery and
the all-volunteer military. But a lottery is just a way to allocate
unfairness, not eliminate it.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, during recent military actions, the press has turned
even active-duty members of the all-volunteer military into your
standard interest group being unfairly imposed upon. And, judging
from those recruiting commercials, America's soldiers are justified
in feeling that they volunteered for computer training, not to risk
their lives in some miserable faraway desert or jungle.
</P>
<P>
   Every political system, even democracy, is about forcing people
to do things they don't want to do. This is justifiable when you
need a social consensus. We must decide communally how clean the
air should be, but we don't need to take a vote on what flavor of
ice cream we prefer. On ice cream, we can each have our own way.
That's even better than democracy.
</P>
<P>
   War and peace would seem to be the classic communal issue, and
most aspects of it _ is it worth engaging the national honor?
killing lots of foreigners _ need to be settled democratically. But
why can't the most painful issues _ whether American lives should
be put at risk, and if so whose _ be settled on the ice cream
model? Why can't people decide for themselves?
</P>
<P>
   Take the main should-we-or-shouldn't-we issue of these years:
humanitarian interventions. (''Humanitarian'' is now a pejorative
term for situations with no, or no self-sufficient,
national-security issue at stake.)
</P>
<P>
   Is Bosnia or Kosovo or Sierra Leone worth some Americans' blood?
There would be no need for a social consensus about this so long as
every individual soldier was truly acting voluntarily. Suppose
there was a volunteer corps explicitly devoted to ``humanitarian''
interventions. Suppose its members could even pick and choose:
Rwanda, yes; Croatia, no ... or, for more money, anywhere you want,
boss. A president wishing to use this corps would have to entice or
persuade enough members or give up.
</P>
<P>
   Would these soldiers be ``mercenaries''? If so, so what? We
positively celebrate mercenary motives these days in most areas of
life. During Vietnam, the columnist Nicholas von Hoffman coined a
brilliant eight-word critique: ``Draft old men's money, not young
men's bodies.'' In other words, why should shooting and getting
shot at, of all professional activities, be expected to sell at a
discount?
</P>
<P>
   But actually, the motives of these people are likely to be less
mercenary than those of current military volunteers (based on the
mercenary themes used to recruit them). Individual motives will
differ. Some will be high-minded idealists. Many, no doubt, will be
low-minded thrill-seekers. Once again, so what?
</P>
<P>
   And is it immoral to pay someone to fight and maybe die for a
cause that is not vital to the national interest? For a war not
``good'' enough, or big enough, for a national draft?
</P>
<P>
   Cruise the Web looking for death. Farming killed 210 people over
a recent five-year period, just in Pennsylvania. According to Sen.
Daniel Patrick Moynihan, an American male's lifetime risk of death
by homicide is about equal to an American soldier's odds of getting
killed during Vietnam. Many jobs are dangerous and life is a
tragedy waiting to happen.
</P>
<P>
   If idealism or machismo or money tempts someone into a dangerous
life serving his country's values, if not its interests narrowly
defined, his is probably a life well spent.

 &HT;    Napster dispute awakens debate about future
 &HT;    By Tom Baxter
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ This week a rowdy young man with headphones and an
attitude has turned up on the cover of Newsweek, official
certification of the Napster Internet piracy controversy as the
trendy story of the summer.
</P>
<P>
   The bane of university computer systems operators and heavy
metal bands grown long in the tooth, Napster, a computer program
that allows users to share music over the Internet, has little
immediate relevance to most Americans. It's just a neat story,
because it involves a lot of gadgets, and because of the delicious
irony of a group like Metallica suing its fans for misbehaving.
</P>
<P>
   Like the first stories about women demanding admittance into
business clubs, however, the issues raised in the Napster story
will survive long past the bloom of trendiness.
</P>
<P>
   The presidential candidates have not had much to say on the
question of whether a college sophomore downloading a Beck album
constitutes a fundamental threat to the principle of property
rights, but Edgar Bronfman Jr., CEO of Seagram Co., which owns
Universal Music Group, sure has.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech last week in San Jose, Bronfman, who also owns the
company that produces ``The Jerry Springer Show,'' warned that the
blurring of the line between privacy and anonymity is having ``a
deleterious effect on our culture, our society and the long-term
growth of the Internet.'' He sounded a Churchillian call to arms
against the Napster pirates.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will fight for our rights and those of our artists ... We
will take our fight to every territory, in every court in every
venue, wherever our fundamental rights are being assaulted and
attacked,'' Bronfman said.
</P>
<P>
   He went so far as to say the Internet, like the Soviet Union,
would ``crack, crumble and collapse'' if it goes down the wrong
path and adheres to the ``dangerous and misguided notion'' that
everything on the Internet should be free.
</P>
<P>
   Sounds bombastic, but bear in mind Bronfman's company owns the
rights to that downloaded Beck album, and he appears willing to put
his money where his mouth is to protect them.
</P>
<P>
   If the idea of grinding the Internet to a halt seems fanciful,
it's easy to see how it could be appealing to the person in control
of the world's largest record company, because of the desirability
of controlling musical tastes to insure a predictable return.
</P>
<P>
   As self-serving as it may seem for the businessman who broke the
46-year voluntary ban on television liquor advertising to rise to
the defense of culture and society, somebody was bound to do it.
</P>
<P>
   And in truth, the Napster story has more to do with the future
than the debate over whether Americans should be able to invest
their social security money in a bond fund. It raises fascinating
cultural questions, but as Bronfman has indicated, it is also
bearing down on the court system.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George W. Bush seldom speaks of China without invoking the
wondrously liberating effects of the Internet, the limits on which
are what is crucially at stake in the Napster story. As the techie
vice president, Al Gore has had the chance to become well-versed in
the legal intricacies of intellectual property.
</P>
<P>
   Both of them should be expected to articulate some thoughtful
beginnings of a policy that spells out where the property ends and
how far the liberty goes. To do so probably won't matter much in
the campaign, but it could give the next president's Justice
Department a head start.

   ATLANTA _ Home Depot's new floor-covering store in Dallas will

</P>
<P>
   The retailer has dubbed the specialty concept the Floor Store,
said President and Chief Executive Arthur Blank. Atlanta-based Home
Depot announced plans for the standalone store in March but didn't
identify the name or opening date.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because we've got such a strong presence in flooring, we
thought it made sense to test something like this,'' Blank said
after the company's annual stockholder meeting Wednesday. ``But let
me emphasize, it's only a one-store test.''
</P>
<P>
   Home Depot dove into carpet, rugs and floor covering in 1996 and
quickly became the No. 1 seller of those goods. It sold $2.25
billion in flooring last year, according to industry estimates.
</P>
<P>
   The Floor Store will carry about 15,000 floor, wall and window
products in a 40,000-square-foot format. About 25 percent to 30
percent of the merchandise will overlap with products Home Depot
sells at its warehouse and Expo Design Center stores, Blank said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We chose Dallas as a test site because we want to see what
kind of impact the Floor Store will have on sales at our other
stores there,'' Blank told reporters. The Dallas area has about 30
Home Depots, which focus on lower price points, and three Expos
selling high-end rugs and carpeting.
</P>
<P>
   This is the first time Home Depot has tried selling such a
specialized line of products in a single store. Its other
freestanding concepts, Expo and Villager's Hardware, sell a range
of goods.
</P>
<P>
   Blank reviewed several initiatives for about 2,500 company
shareholders attending the annual meeting near Atlanta. The
initiatives included the company's planned summer launch of a
limited electronic commerce Web site, and its growing focus on
professional customers.
</P>
<P>
   The tone of the meeting was markedly more genial than in recent
years, when environmental groups staged high-profile protests of
Home Depot's sales of ``old-growth'' wood products. Last August,
Home Depot said it would start phasing out wood from endangered
forests.
</P>
<P>
   The main complaint Blank faced this year was a relatively rare
one at Home Depot gatherings. The company's stock has lost nearly a
third of its value this year, and some shareholders wanted to know
why.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have the same question,'' Blank said. ``Over the long haul,
the stock's going to be fine. But I have the same lack of patience
you do with the stock market. Believe me.''
</P>
<P>
   Blank blamed Wall Street's preoccupation with rising interest
rates, which tend to spook investors. Shares of Home Depot closed
at $48.81 1/4, up $1.56 1/4.
</P>
<P>
   In other business, shareholders adopted a proposal to recommend
that Home Depot reinstate simple-majority voting on all issues
subject to shareholder vote. That would eliminate current
``super-majority'' provisions requiring approval of at least 80
percent of outstanding shares for major matters such as mergers.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal still must be approved by Home Depot's board of
directors and at least 80 percent of shareholders in a future vote.
Shareholders rejected for the third straight year a proposal that
the company disclose more about the gender and racial makeup of its
232,000 employees.
</P>
<P>
   Home Depot reports summaries of its female and minority hiring,
but certain institutional investors want the retailer to report
detailed data within job categories by race and gender.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Home Depot's board declared a quarterly cash dividend of
four cents per share, payable June 29, to stockholders of record on
June 15.

 &HT;    Stocks pull back after big run-up
 &HT;    By Tom Walker
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The bad news apparently wasn't bad enough for the stock market
Wednesday. Instead of rallying to news of economic slowing that
might curb future Federal Reserve interest rate hikes, investors
took profits instead from the market's latest gains.
</P>
<P>
   Slower home sales, reduced industrial activity and indications
of future slowing failed to prevent the market from ending a losing
month _ the fourth this year _ with a losing session.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said Tuesday's strong gains, including the biggest-ever
one-day percentage gain for the Nasdaq composite index and a big
gain for the Dow Jones industrial average, made profit-taking too
tempting to pass up.
</P>
<P>
   Prudential Securities strategist Larry Wachtel said Wednesday's
stock market performance was open to interpretation.
</P>
<P>
   ``To those who felt that (Tuesday's) moon shot ushered in a
brave new world, the modest performance on Wednesday may have been
disappointing,'' he said. ``But to those who feel that the biggest
Nasdaq percentage gain in history was tough act to follow,
Wednesday was respectable.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts had speculated that this week's economic news would
help investors make up their minds which way they think the Federal
Reserve will go with its policy of raising interest rates to slow
an inflationary economy.
</P>
<P>
   But apparently the market decided that one day's news was not a
trend, and not enough to convince investors the Fed is about to
reverse its anti-inflation policy.
</P>
<P>
   The most important report came from the Purchasing Management
Association of Chicago, whose index of business activity fell to
53.9 in May, on a seasonally adjusted basis, from 56.5 in April.
Economists considered it a good gauge of the national purchasing
managers' report, due out today.
</P>
<P>
   The report ``that growth in the factory sector is moderating is
good news for the Fed, but the slowing is nowhere near enough to
keep them from boosting rates further,'' said First Union economist
Mark Vitner.
</P>
<P>
   The Commerce Department also reported that sales of new homes
tumbled 5.8 percent in April, the largest decline since last
September.
</P>
<P>
   And the Conference Board's Index of Leading Economic Indicators,
which is thought to predict activity six to nine months in the
future, declined by 0.1 percent last month.
</P>
<P>
   The market may show more reaction Friday when the government
releases its report on job growth and unemployment report, for May.
</P>
<P>
   The monthly report has become one of the most important and
watched-for economic signals.
</P>
<P>
   The April unemployment rate fell to 3.9 percent from 4.1
percent, indicating no letup in the nation's tight labor markets.
</P>
<P>
   In Wednesday's trading, Qualcomm was blamed for leading the
Nasdaq sell-off, falling 13 percent on news that China Unicom will
not use the company's current cell phone technology. The Nasdaq
fell 1.7 percent.

<P>
   After nearly 25 years in the business, Randolph Walker knew
better than to bank on an audition. Still, when he headed home last
week after trying out for a bit part in a movie called ``Dummy,''
he could not help feeling a little hopeful.
</P>
<P>
   Life as a New York actor demands a difficult combination of
realism and optimism, and Walker had perfected it, scraping by on
the odd bits of work that define daily existence for so many people
in the profession.
</P>
<P>
   It was on his trip home to West 43rd Street last Monday that
Walker was fatally struck by a double-decker tour bus at Ninth
Avenue and 45th Street, setting off a wave of outrage against the
operator of the bus, problem-ridden New York Apple Tours.
</P>
<P>
   The reaction in theater circles was more than anger or sadness
at seeing a 71-year-old man struck down. New York's acting rank and
file, who live the rare highs and relentless lows of the city's
performing arts, had lost one of their own.
</P>
<P>
   To some workaday actors Walker was a familiar face from
countless casting calls for ``mature man, 60 to 75.'' To others he
was a gracious fellow cast member, happy to mentor and befriend
younger colleagues. To the actors who knew him as Ran, and even
those who didn't know him at all, Walker embodied their struggle: a
working actor aiming for the big break even as he tries to make
ends meet, a devoted performer willing to take roles in remote
dinner theaters or obscure downtown workshops because of a love of
the stage, a survivor who _ with the exception of a couple of
Christmases on the sales floor at Brooks Brothers _ proved it was
possible to tough it out without waiting tables or working for a
temp agency.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are so many actors who don't work at all, and here was a
guy who supported himself as an actor,'' said Todd Heughens, 38,
who became close friends with Walker 14 years ago while working on
a Boston production of ``1776.'' ``So I think he took great pride
in that.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Walker in many ways typified the life of a certain tier
of New York actor. He lived in Manhattan Plaza, the
government-subsidized apartment complex mainly for performing
artists on West 43rd Street where tenants pay 30 percent of their
income as rent, an amount adjusted annually. Generally, a friend
estimated, Walker paid about $500 a month for his 18th-floor studio
overlooking the Hudson River.
</P>
<P>
   He went to the theater whenever he could, availing himself of
the occasional discounts available to members of the profession.
Sometimes Walker would be invited to final dress rehearsals, known
as gypsy runs, by friends in the cast.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from playing a minor role in one Broadway show, Walker
worked at a level that included dinner theaters, which generally
pay $300 to $600 a week; print advertisements, which can pay $100
to $500; and workshop productions, which often don't pay at all.
Despite painful dry spells, Walker always got another job
eventually. His income, though, fluctuated from year to year.
</P>
<P>
   ``He could land a tour and have a good year,'' Heughens said,
``but he could have a year where he earned under $30,000.''
</P>
<P>
   Walker had to work 20 weeks of the year to get unemployment
insurance. His main concern was reaching that cutoff _ and, with
the exception of one year, he always did. This hurdle aside, Walker
was consumed with getting auditions and then making the most of
them. Even knowing the odds, friends say, he would get his hopes up
every time.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had a lot of auditions but also a lot of rejections,'' said
Stephen Morello, 82, his companion of 21 years. ``You know how the
theater is _ you have to be a certain age and have a certain
look.''
</P>
<P>
   Because his survival depended on working, Walker never turned
anything down. Six foot and 165 pounds, with gray hair and brown
eyes and a resonant voice, he was generally cast in small character
parts. Butlers, undertakers and Scrooges were his bread and butter.
</P>
<P>
   In a regional production of the musical ``Annie,'' for example,
he played Drake, the head butler; in a regional ``Man From La
Mancha,'' the innkeeper. He also did a few turns on soap operas
like ``As the World Turns'' and ``One Life to Live.'' Heughens, now
an art director, described this as ``under-five work,'' when actors
are hired for the day and have fewer than five lines.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Petito, who directed Walker in plays produced by his
former Off Off Broadway acting company and now runs La Stanza
Verde, a restaurant on Theater Row, said that ``people like Ran get
lost in the shuffle.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He should have been doing so much more dramatic work or
sophisticated comedy,'' Petito said.
</P>
<P>
   Walker was happy to travel to Muskegon, Mich., to play a couple
of roles in ``Camelot'' or to be a judge in a background scene in
one of the ``Godfather'' movies or to portray a man who founded an
evaporated-milk company in a television commercial or to be the
taped tour guide for the Museum of the City of New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``He usually played funeral directors,'' said Michael Hartig,
Walker's agent, who represented the actor for about 20 years. ``He
had a very charactery look, right out of the movies in the '40s. If
he had gone to Hollywood, he would have had a big career.''
</P>
<P>
   There are many different union contracts for actors based on a
production's venue, and Walker usually worked at one of the lowest
pay scales. Casting directors, who ultimately send their
recommendations on to the director of a production, say that Walker
seemed to feel that nothing was beneath him.
</P>
<P>
   ``The money was less important,'' said Steven DeAngelis, a
casting director at Grey Worldwide, the advertising agency, who
cast Walker in various parts. ``He was willing to audition for
every kind of job. A lot of actors' first words are: `What contract
is it? How much is it paying?' His were: `Who wrote the music? Who
is the director?'''

 NEW YORK: the director?  
<TEXT>
<P>
   What made all the anonymous bit parts worthwhile were the
occasional meaty roles Walker landed in serious plays _ even if
they were produced in out-of-the-way places for no pay. ``Ran was
the kind of performer for whom the work was the reward, the process
was the reward,'' DeAngelis said.
</P>
<P>
   Friends say that Walker was particularly proud of the
performance he gave in the Heritage Theater Company's production of
``Taking Sides'' last month at the U.S. Custom House in Lower
Manhattan, where, for $3 a day in car fare, he played Wilhelm
Furtwangler, the controversial German conductor who did not join
the Nazi party but sympathized with aspects of the totalitarian
regime.
</P>
<P>
   Walker apparently found the experience of having a leading role
disorienting. ``He hadn't done a role of that size in so many
years,'' Heughens said. ``He kept saying, `How am I going to
remember the lines?'''
</P>
<P>
   It was a workshop production for invited guests. In a letter to
the theater company's founder and artistic director, Thomas Luce
Summa, Rhoda Nathan, president of the Bernard Shaw Society, wrote:
``I thought that Randolph Walker's Furtwangler was extraordinary.
He managed to break your heart and generate skepticism about his
behavior at the same time.''
</P>
<P>
   Walker had been a charter member of the Heritage, an Off Off
Broadway company, for 30 years. Summa said his company had for the
last five years been planning to do ``The Merchant of Venice'' with
Walker in the role of Shylock, but Walker kept having to pass in
favor of projects that paid the rent. ``Every time we'd start, Ran
would get a part,'' Summa said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He did so many small parts in musicals. His part in `The King
and I' on Broadway was a small part. It wasn't a challenge.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, appearing on Broadway once _ as Walker did as Sir Edward
Ramsay in the 1976 revival of ``The King and I,'' with Yul Brynner
_ can be a mixed blessing, Heughens said, ``like your career
peaked.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Hartig sent Walker out on various casting calls,
friends say Walker also hustled on his own, combing the trade
papers for auditions, keeping in touch with directors he had worked
with about whether there might be a role for him in their future
projects.
</P>
<P>
   Walker was tough on himself. ``He wished he was a little more
ambitious,'' Heughens said. ``Maybe he could have made a little
more of a name for himself or worried about money a little bit
less.''
</P>
<P>
   Walker belonged to a small circle of older men who go up for the
same parts, regularly running into one another in the waiting room
outside the casting room door. Nevertheless, the people who were
part of this group say Walker was noncompetitive in the extreme,
that he told his friends about roles he was seeking so they could
try to get them also, that he was happy for them even when they won
parts he had wanted.
</P>
<P>
   ``We competed a couple of times for roles,'' said Keith Perry,
69, a fellow actor who became a friend. ``We shared
disappointments. There was never a jealousy in Ran.''
</P>
<P>
   Walker also gained a reputation for mentoring younger cast
members. ``When he worked on shows, they would gravitate toward
him,'' Hartig said. ``He was kind of like Santa Claus. He always
had time to talk to them, to share his knowledge and his
expertise.''
</P>
<P>
   In large part, those who knew Walker say, this generosity
stemmed from the fact that Walker simply felt lucky to be working
in the theater after so many years of having stayed away. Soon
after his 1951 marriage to a fellow drama student he met during
freshman year at Rollins College in Winter Park, Fla., Walker left
the theater to become a banker. ``I think he realized it was almost
impossible to make a living that way,'' said Eleanor Walker, the
actor's former wife.
</P>
<P>
   The Walkers had two children, a son who died at 16 in a fire and
a daughter, Katharine Hoffman, who lives in a Chicago suburb with
her husband, Richard, and their two teen-age sons.
</P>
<P>
   After his divorce in 1976, Walker came to New York to try to
return to professional acting. ``I think he felt like his whole
life had started all over again,'' said Nagle Jackson, former
artistic director of the McCarter Theater Center in Princeton,
N.J., who in 1990 directed Walker in his adaptation of ``A Tale of
Two Cities.'' (Reviewing the play for The New York Times, Wilborn
Hampton said Walker ``presents a detestably wheedling Barsad.'')
</P>
<P>
   Although years ago he had a triple bypass operation, Walker had
a youthful spirit and seemed strong. He and Morello traveled every
year together and had been planning a trip to Venice in September.
</P>
<P>
   Although Walker did not look at his acting career as a model for
up-and-coming actors, friends say it was a shining example to many
of them nonetheless.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a life you choose, and he chose this life and he was
going to make it work,'' Heughens said. ``Sure, he would rather be
doing a Broadway show, but if that didn't come his way, he wasn't
going to chuck it all, either.''

TEX BENEKE, MUSICIAN WHO LED GLENN MILLER ORCHESTRA, DIES AT 86 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Texas)   By BEN RATLIFF   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Tex Beneke, the tenor saxophone player and vocalist with the
Glenn Miller Orchestra who sang one of its most famous hits,
``Chattanooga Choo Choo,'' and led the band after Miller's plane
disappeared in World War II, died on Tuesday at a convalescent home
in Costa Mesa, Calif. He was 86.
</P>
<P>
   The cheerful, sunny voice of the unassuming boy singer from
Texas was ubiquitous on the American soundtrack in the early years
of World War II. In 1941 the Miller orchestra introduced the Harry
Warren-Mack Gordon song ``Chattanooga Choo Choo'' in the movie
musical extravaganza ``Sun Valley Serenade.'' Tex Beneke was joined
by Paula Kelly and the Modernaires, and the Nicholas Brothers and
Dorothy Dandridge danced along. The recording on the Blue Bird
label was a million-seller.
</P>
<P>
   Tex Beneke's vocals were also heard on Miller hits like ``I've
Got a Gal in Kalamazoo,'' ``Ida! Sweet as Apple Cider'' and ``Don't
Sit Under the Apple Tree (With Anyone Else but Me).''
</P>
<P>
   Born in Fort Worth, Texas, on Feb. 12, 1914, Gordon Beneke
started playing the saxophone at age 9. He joined the Ben Young
orchestra in 1935, playing one-nighters in the Midwest, and in 1938
he and the band found themselves in Detroit. The drummer Gene Krupa
was looking for players to join his new orchestra and hired three
players from the Young band, not including Beneke. But Krupa knew
Glenn Miller, and over lunch in New York recommended Beneke to him.
Miller called Beneke and offered him a job at a starting salary of
$50 a week.
</P>
<P>
   Beneke's reply, as he recounted in a 1985 interview, was: ``Tell
you what I'll do, Glenn. I'll come with the band for $52.50 a
week.'' After a silence, Miller replied, ``All right, I'll give it
to you. But you're going to have to prove that you're worth the
extra two and a half dollars.''
</P>
<P>
   When Beneke arrived at his first rehearsal, Miller greeted him
with ``OK, Tex, get your horn,'' bestowing a permanent nickname.
</P>
<P>
   At first Beneke was only a saxophonist in the Miller orchestra,
but that soon changed. On tours, Beneke and Miller would take turns
driving Miller's car, and one night Beneke was singing ``Ida! Sweet
as Apple Cider'' to keep himself awake. Miller seized on the idea
and asked Billy May, one of the band's arrangers, to write an
arrangement for Beneke to sing in his gentle, Southern voice.
Beneke agreed, although he had no previous professional singing
experience. He soon became one of the band's most popular soloists.
</P>
<P>
   Beneke was one of the day's popular jazz saxophonists. The
critic Gunther Schuller, in his book ``The Swing Era,'' described
his even, romantic, easy-to-follow playing as a ``smoothed-out
Coleman Hawkins'' style, and he was given many of the saxophone
solos that dotted the orchestra's famous ensemble reed sound.
</P>
<P>
   After appearing in the films ``Orchestra Wives'' and ``Sun
Valley Serenade,'' both of which feature Beneke's playing and
singing, Miller dissolved his band in 1942 and joined the Army Air
Corps. Beneke joined the Navy in 1943. In 1944 Miller's plane
vanished without a trace in a flight from England to France, and
his widow, Helen Miller, asked Beneke to take the Glenn Miller
orchestra back out on the road.
</P>
<P>
   He did, and the ghost band had a string of hits both on record
and in the remaining dance palaces of America. In December 1947,
even as the big band era faded, Tex Beneke and the Glenn Miller
Orchestra played to a record-breaking crowd of 6,750 dancers at the
Hollywood Palladium.
</P>
<P>
   However, by the late 1940s he grew tired of having to repeat the
classic Miller arrangements at every appearance and quit the band
to strike out on his own. His action may have led to his absence
from the 1953 film ``The Glenn Miller Story,'' which starred Jimmy
Stewart as the bandleader and which made no mention of Beneke, who
had played such a prominent role in the band's success.
</P>
<P>
   Beneke's own band, Tex Beneke and his Orchestra, lasted for 50
years, recording for MCA and other labels. The Miller songbook was
the mainstay of its repertory, but the orchestra also performed the
music of Count Basie, Duke Ellington, Tommy Dorsey and others. The
Tex Beneke Orchestra, now under the operation of Jim Snodgrass,
still tours and performs, and is based in Southern California.
</P>
<P>
   Beneke is survived by his wife, Sandra, of Santa Ana, Calif.

</P>
<P>
   Talk radio, which forfeited whatever cool it had in the '90s to
the Internet, is reclaiming its buzz. Rush Limbaugh has made
headlines by nominating himself to host Monday Night Football. He
auditioned for the job, and ABC is treating him as a serious
candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Dr. Laura Schlessinger, the Ma Barker of radio
therapists, is warring with gay activists over her planned TV show.
</P>
<P>
   Enraged that Dr. Laura calls homosexuality ``deviant'' and a
``biological error,'' gays have persuaded advertisers such as
Procter &AMP; Gamble, Xerox and Toysrus.com to sever ties to her. A
board of Canadian broadcast censors just sanctioned her for
anti-gay bigotry as well. The upheaval is flustering Paramount,
Schlessinger's network, and may be jeopardizing the show's
September launch.
</P>
<P>
   This hiccup of talk radio news is a reminder that radio gab is
not merely alive, but healthy. Radio revenue is soaring. Talk radio
may not be the ground zero of GOP activism, as it was in 1994, and
Limbaugh is no longer, as William Bennett once claimed, the ``most
consequential person in public life,'' but Limbaugh attracts as
many listeners as he did at the height of his fame, at least 14.5
million per week, according to Talkers magazine. As such, he
remains the leading radio talker in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Limbaugh has become Republican establishment radio, and he
retains enormous influence in GOP politics. His carpet-bombing of
John McCain as a closet liberal _ an assault unremarked on by the
mainstream media _ is widely credited with ensuring George W.
Bush's South Carolina primary victory. Dr. Laura draws 14.25
million listeners per week, placing her a close second to Rush
</P>
<P>
   Those who don't pay attention to Rush and Dr. Laura _ that is,
most Americans _ tend to lump them together. That conflation is
understandable, because they seem the Ozzie and Harriet of
conservative radio. Rush takes care of the right-wing politics
(down with Hillary, etc.), while Dr. Laura supervises the
conservative home (no divorce, no premarital sex, shut up and
listen to me, you idiot).
</P>
<P>
   Their shows are similar in format: Both talk virtually nonstop
for three hours, use their callers as foils, and never have guests.
Both are bombastic. And both are most appealing for their absolute
certitude. They allow no gray to creep into their black-and-white
worlds. Nothing shakes their conviction that right is right and
that left is evil.
</P>
<P>
   But there is a critical difference that separates Dr. Laura and
Rush, the reason why his TV venture will succeed and hers won't:
He's a professional, and she's not.
</P>
<P>
   Limbaugh's critics have been flaying him for his Monday Night
Football ambitions: He has never broadcast sports, they say. He is
detested by too many people _ dittoheads are a tiny minority. He
couldn't keep his politics off the gridiron. Imagine what would
happen if President Clinton showed up at a Redskins game!
</P>
<P>
   Such skepticism underestimates Limbaugh. When he first emerged,
liberals pegged him as the next Morton Downey Jr., a loony who
would self-destruct on-air. But Limbaugh has grown more acceptable
with age, largely because he has always paid attention to the
``real goals of radio: ratings and revenue,'' says Talkers Editor
Michael Harrison. Limbaugh has smoothed his rough edges. He has
all-but-dropped the term ``feminazi.'' When he was lambasted for
mocking AIDS victims, he quickly apologized. He stopped performing
``caller abortions.''
</P>
<P>
   Other political talk radio shows stumble because their hosts put
the politics before radio (see sclerotic Bob Grant). But Limbaugh
never makes that mistake. He is a genuine conservative, but ``he is
a political entertainer and a consummate pro,'' says John Fund of
the Wall Street Journal, who helped write Limbaugh's first book.
``Don't forget he was a DJ.''
</P>
<P>
   Limbaugh the vaudevillian _ not Limbaugh the winger _ could be a
delight in the Monday Night Football booth. Even people who can't
stand his politics concede that he's a wonderful, funny talker.
Limbaugh would play Howard Cosell. He would talk big and loud and
use his bombast _ most of which is a put-on _ to generate the
controversy and vim absent from football now.
</P>
<P>
   Why would Rush succeed on Monday Night Football when he bombed
as a TV talk show host several years ago? Rush is not telegenic,
and he proved himself a poor TV interviewer. But the football
broadcast, unlike his old TV show, would essentially be a radio
gig: Rush would be off-camera for 99 percent of the broadcast, and
he would be riffing, not interviewing.
</P>
<P>
   Where Limbaugh smirks, Schlessinger glowers, and that may be her
downfall. She has proved strangely impervious to the criticism that
should have ruined her, that she's a hypocrite. But Dr. Laura does
have an Achilles' heel: her conviction. She considers herself a
savior, not an entertainer.
</P>
<P>
   The longer Limbaugh is on the air, the softer he becomes. The
longer Schlessinger is on the air, the harder she becomes.
Limbaugh's bombast is an act; Schlessinger's is real. She has no
doubt and no sense of humor. ``I am a prophet,'' she says. ``I am a
philosopher.'' She knows how everyone else should live.
</P>
<P>
   Popularity has made her arrogant. Three years ago, Dr. Laura
made at least the pretense of listening to the people who phoned
in. Today she berates them before they finish a sentence.
</P>
<P>
   Her idea of constructive criticism is a frying pan in the head _
you're a bad parent, you're a liar, you're a coward. Dr. Laura used
to be refreshing because she offered advice that few others did _
don't divorce, don't have sex, etc. As the culture has gotten more
conservative _ thanks, in part, to Dr. Laura _ she sounds just like
everyone else, only nastier.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Laura's acid enemas work on the radio, a medium that has
always been hospitable to ranters. But that style will bomb in the
winking, shrugging medium of television.
</P>
<P>
   Television abhors a moralizer.
</P>
<P>
   Almost no one sits in judgment on television, except for the
occasional judge. Jerry Springer may hector the clowns and morons
on his show, but that is jokey spectacle. The only TV figures who
are as serious and certain as Dr. Laura are TV preachers _ chiefly
Pat Robertson. But Robertson speaks softly and smiles wide.
Schlessinger, with her taut face and sharp teeth, looks vicious.
</P>
<P>
   So vicious, in fact, that gay groups might want to reconsider
their campaign to stop her TV show. They should push to get her on
the air. She will find her studio audience stupid and her guests
morally lax. She'll tear muscle from bone then spit out the blood.
She will be canceled in months. Eventually, reruns of Schlessinger
will play on the Discovery Channel, after ``Predators of the
Serengeti.''

GRAHAM TROUPE DECLINES OFFER TO PERFORM AT DURHAM FESTIVAL 
</HEADLINE>
   By JENNIFER DUNNING    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The dancers of the Martha Graham Co., which suspended
operations last Friday because of financial problems, have declined
an invitation to perform independently at the American Dance
Festival in Durham, N.C. The troupe had been scheduled to open the
festival next Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to suspend activity in the Graham company, school
and junior ensemble came during a battle between Ron Protas, whom
Graham named as her successor and who leads the Martha Graham
Trust, and board members and administrators, including the acting
chairman, Francis Mason and Marvin Preston, executive director of
the Graham company. Board members on both sides say the feud has
made donors reluctant to help the company, which has a deficit of
$500,000.
</P>
<P>
   The dancers said in a strongly worded statement on Tuesday that
``to work as a pickup company hired by individual presenters having
to license the Martha Graham ballets like any other company in the
world only profits Ron Protas and the Martha Graham Trust and not
the Martha Graham Center or the company, which Martha herself
founded and which has been in existence for nearly 75 years and in
which place lives Martha's technique and ballets.''
</P>
<P>
   Responding to the dancers, Protas said Wednesday that he
receives no special fees for performances. Under the terms of his
agreement with the Martha Graham Dance Center, which oversees the
school and companies, he receives $1 a year in royalties, though he
is a paid artistic consultant to the center.
</P>
<P>
   The dancers also said that accepting the offer to perform would
be short-sighted and not a solution to ``the inherent problems that
plague the inner structure of the Martha Graham Dance Company.''
Performing at the festival, they said, would ``not in any way
address the larger concerns for the future or truly answer the
question of who is responsible for bringing the company to this
tragic point or why.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The dancers wish to work cooperatively with the board and with
Ron Protas to allow the company to remain together and to continue
Martha's legacy,'' said the dancers. ``There is no justification
based on ego, pride, money or power to suspend operations of a
company of such great stature and significance as the Martha Graham
Dance Company.''
</P>
<P>
   The dancers agreed to meet Preston and Mason at the troupe's
temporary headquarters in the East Village on Tuesday, the day they
were to have begun rehearsals. Protas did not attend. When Preston
and Mason left to talk with the students, a vote on the festival
performances was taken with 13 dancers of the 17-member company
voting no. Two dancers abstained and two did not attend the
meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Protas, who would have had to license the dances to the festival
for the performances, also turned down the invitation to avoid
possible conflicts with the center. ``The leadership of the board
and Ron deserve each other,'' said Charles Reinhart, who directs
the festival with Stephanie Reinhart. ``Other companies and arts
institutions have financial difficulties to a greater extent than
this and are able to continue. This is a war, and the real
casualties are the dancers and the Graham public.''
</P>
<P>
   In declining the invitation, the dancers lost three weeks of
work, including rehearsals. A European tour, appearances in
California and performances at the John F. Kennedy Center for the
Performing Arts have also been canceled. The company was also to
perform at the Joyce Theater in Manhattan in November. Linda
Shelton, executive director of the Joyce, said Wednesday that the
Joyce was exploring other possibilities for the Graham dates.
</P>
<P>
   Despina Diamantopoulou, speaking for the Graham students, issued
a statement on Tuesday asking the public for emergency financing to
keep the school open. The suspension of the Graham school programs,
which have drawn students around the world, has been a particular
problem for the foreign students who make up half the annual
enrollment of about 500 students. With all employees owed a month's
pay, school administrators, class accompanists and teachers have
volunteered to keep the school going day by day during the summer
term while a search goes on for space and money.
</P>
<P>
   ``Three accompanists showed up,'' Pearl Lang, a former Graham
star who teaches at the school, said Wednesday about a class this
week. ``I had an orchestra!''
</P>
<P>
   Among the offers of financial support to the school was a
promise of $1,000, enough for one day's operation of the school,
from a dancer who performed with Ruth St. Denis, Graham's teacher.
</P>
<P>
   ``Theoretically we're closing up,'' Preston said Wednesday.
``But I say `theoretically' because we're still trying to figure
out how to start it up. Nobody wants this thing to go away. We just
have to be careful to be responsible.''

most Americans _ tend to lump them together. That conflation is
understandable, because they seem the Ozzie and Harriet of
conservative radio. Rush takes care of the right-wing politics
(down with Hillary, etc.), while Dr. Laura supervises the
conservative home (no divorce, no premarital sex, shut up and
listen to me, you idiot).
</P>
<P>
   Their shows are similar in format: Both talk virtually nonstop
for three hours, use their callers as foils, and never have guests.
Both are bombastic. And both are most appealing for their absolute
certitude. They allow no gray to creep into their black-and-white
worlds. Nothing shakes their conviction that right is right and
that left is evil.
</P>
<P>
   But there is a critical difference that separates Dr. Laura and
Rush, the reason why his TV venture will succeed and hers won't:
He's a professional, and she's not.
</P>
<P>
   Limbaugh's critics have been flaying him for his Monday Night
Football ambitions: He has never broadcast sports, they say. He is
detested by too many people _ dittoheads are a tiny minority. He
couldn't keep his politics off the gridiron. Imagine what would
happen if President Clinton showed up at a Redskins game!
</P>
<P>
   Such skepticism underestimates Limbaugh. When he first emerged,
liberals pegged him as the next Morton Downey Jr., a loony who
would self-destruct on-air. But Limbaugh has grown more acceptable
with age, largely because he has always paid attention to the
``real goals of radio: ratings and revenue,'' says Talkers Editor
Michael Harrison. Limbaugh has smoothed his rough edges. He has
all-but-dropped the term ``feminazi.'' When he was lambasted for
mocking AIDS victims, he quickly apologized. He stopped performing
``caller abortions.''
</P>
<P>
   Other political talk radio shows stumble because their hosts put
the politics before radio (see sclerotic Bob Grant). But Limbaugh
never makes that mistake. He is a genuine conservative, but ``he is
a political entertainer and a consummate pro,'' says John Fund of
the Wall Street Journal, who helped write Limbaugh's first book.
``Don't forget he was a DJ.''
</P>
<P>
   Limbaugh the vaudevillian _ not Limbaugh the winger _ could be a
delight in the Monday Night Football booth. Even people who can't
stand his politics concede that he's a wonderful, funny talker.
Limbaugh would play Howard Cosell. He would talk big and loud and
use his bombast _ most of which is a put-on _ to generate the
controversy and vim absent from football now.
</P>
<P>
   Why would Rush succeed on Monday Night Football when he bombed
as a TV talk show host several years ago? Rush is not telegenic,
and he proved himself a poor TV interviewer. But the football
broadcast, unlike his old TV show, would essentially be a radio
gig: Rush would be off-camera for 99 percent of the broadcast, and
he would be riffing, not interviewing.
</P>
<P>
   Where Limbaugh smirks, Schlessinger glowers, and that may be her
downfall. She has proved strangely impervious to the criticism that
should have ruined her, that she's a hypocrite. But Dr. Laura does
have an Achilles' heel: her conviction. She considers herself a
savior, not an entertainer.
</P>
<P>
   The longer Limbaugh is on the air, the softer he becomes. The
longer Schlessinger is on the air, the harder she becomes.
Limbaugh's bombast is an act; Schlessinger's is real. She has no
doubt and no sense of humor. ``I am a prophet,'' she says. ``I am a
philosopher.'' She knows how everyone else should live.
</P>
<P>
   Popularity has made her arrogant. Three years ago, Dr. Laura
made at least the pretense of listening to the people who phoned
in. Today she berates them before they finish a sentence.
</P>
<P>
   Her idea of constructive criticism is a frying pan in the head _
you're a bad parent, you're a liar, you're a coward. Dr. Laura used
to be refreshing because she offered advice that few others did _
don't divorce, don't have sex, etc. As the culture has gotten more
conservative _ thanks, in part, to Dr. Laura _ she sounds just like
everyone else, only nastier.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Laura's acid enemas work on the radio, a medium that has
always been hospitable to ranters. But that style will bomb in the
winking, shrugging medium of television.
</P>
<P>
   Television abhors a moralizer.
</P>
<P>
   Almost no one sits in judgment on television, except for the
occasional judge. Jerry Springer may hector the clowns and morons
on his show, but that is jokey spectacle. The only TV figures who
are as serious and certain as Dr. Laura are TV preachers _ chiefly
Pat Robertson. But Robertson speaks softly and smiles wide.
Schlessinger, with her taut face and sharp teeth, looks vicious.
</P>
<P>
   So vicious, in fact, that gay groups might want to reconsider
their campaign to stop her TV show. They should push to get her on
the air. She will find her studio audience stupid and her guests
morally lax. She'll tear muscle from bone then spit out the blood.
She will be canceled in months. Eventually, reruns of Schlessinger
will play on the Discovery Channel, after ``Predators of the
Serengeti.''

 &HT;    Beijing goes for the gold in 2008 Olympics bid
 &HT;    By Keith Graham
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ It's ... Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   No, not exactly. No one from the International Olympic Committee
has said that. Not yet, anyway, but Li Jian has a vision.
</P>
<P>
   He remembers watching television when Atlantans heard that their
city would host the 1996 Games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still remember the exuberance of your people,'' says Li, a
longtime sports reporter for China's state-controlled press.
``That's what impressed us.'' And jubilation like that is Li's
vision for the people of his city, some day in the not-too-distant
future.
</P>
<P>
   It's a vision that fits into a far grander dream. As he walks
through the site where a decade ago Beijing hosted the Asian Games,
sometimes called the ``Eastern Olympics,'' Li throws his arms wide
and says this is where the Olympic village will be built. Only it
will be 10 times as large as the village for the Asian event.
</P>
<P>
   He speaks of the city's hotels being filled with ``foreign
friends coming to Beijing and understanding the real situation
here.''
</P>
<P>
   And he sees the city itself as much grander than today: Thanks
to billions of dollars of investment in improved infrastructure,
even the hovering cloud of air pollution will largely be gone.
</P>
<P>
   Li has traded in his press pass for a post as deputy division
chief of publicity for the Beijing 2008 Olympic Games Bid Committee
and perhaps he exaggerates.
</P>
<P>
   But among the team of about 60 organizers already bustling at
work on a donated floor in the Beijing Xinquiao Hotel, the
ex-sportswriter's dream is widely shared.
</P>
<P>
   Like Li, Wang Wei, the general secretary of the committee, says
he remembers Atlanta's celebration. He predicts the eruption in his
city, if Beijing successfully lands the Games, will top any
celebration by a city yet.
</P>
<P>
   Even in the 1940s, China had dreamed of hosting an Olympics.
``But at that time the facilities were not so good,'' Wang says. In
the era of reform following the death of leader Mao Zedong, Deng
Xiaoping gave the green light for a serious effort for Beijing to
become a host city. And in 1993, when the 2000 Games were up for
grabs, Beijing came, oh, so close. It lost to Sydney by only two
votes.
</P>
<P>
   Deeply stung by that defeat, Beijing sat out the 2004 bidding,
won by Athens. But it is mounting a full-tilt effort for the 2008
Summer Games.
</P>
<P>
   The city is not alone in wanting the honor. Nine other
metropolises _ Bangkok, Havana, Istanbul, Kuala Lumpur, Osaka,
Paris, Seville, Toronto and Cairo _ have submitted formal
applications to the IOC for the Games to be formally awarded in
Moscow in July 2001. In August the list is expected to be narrowed
down, but handicappers generally place Beijing as the front-runner
with Paris and Toronto as the closest competitors.
</P>
<P>
   Wang, for one, is not ready to declare his city a winner and
even adds a couple of applicants _ Osaka and Cairo _ to the list of
neck-and-neck competitors.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1993 vote, Beijing was hurt by sentiment _ then still
very fresh _ that the June 1989 massacre of human rights
demonstrators at Tiananmen Square had greatly tarnished China's
international standing. This weekend will mark the 11th anniversary
of the confrontation between troops and demonstrators in Tiananmen.
</P>
<P>
   Wang acknowledges that world perceptions about China's human
rights record could still pose a problem for the city's bid. But he
is hoping the passage of time and the greater openness of the
government in recent years will blunt those criticisms.
</P>
<P>
   ``In geographic location, in population and in cultural aspects,
Beijing leads the competition,'' he says, speaking through an
interpreter. ``Beijing is quite different from those (other)
cities.''

&HT;     MIDLAND BOY BOWS OUT OF NATIONAL SPELLING BEE IN OPENING
ROUND 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By AUSTIN ZALKIN  
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Michael Moore, a sixth grader at Crockett
Elementary School in Midland, Tex., spelled ``septentrional''
correctly at the National Spelling Bee Wednesday, but missed his
next spelling challenge and was eliminated.
</P>
<P>
   The word that ended his run was ``negotiability.'' Michael
started spelling the word with an ``na'' instead of an ``ne.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what you get for living in Texas,'' Michael's father,
Bruce, joked, referring to the way the beginning of
``negotiability'' sounds with an accent. ``It's just the luck of
the draw,'' he concluded about the words Michael had been asked to
spell.
</P>
<P>
   Michael, 12, was younger than most of the other contestants. He
said he will continue to study spelling and will try to come back
to the national competition next year. His sister Stacey competed
last year.
</P>
<P>
   Michael, who won his first school bee in third grade, has two
years of eligibility remaining. High school students are
ineligible. He was sponsored in the competition by the Midland
Reporter-Telegram.
</P>
<P>
   He joined 247 other fifth- through eighth-grade students from
around the nation in the 73rd bee, sponsored by Scripps-Howard Co.
</P>
<P>
   His first contest word, ``septentrional'' _ defined as
``northern'' _ was taken from a list distributed to the contestants
in advance of the competition.
</P>
<P>
   His mother, Pam, said she had rehearsed the word with Michael.
She said Michael had been studying since November for the regional
and national competitions.
</P>
<P>
   The words from the next round of questions were taken randomly
from the dictionary. That's when Michael was asked to spell
``negotiability.''
</P>
<P>
   First, he exercised the right of all contestants to ask for the
definition of the word. Then he asked the judge to use the word in
a sentence. Spellers also are allowed to ask for alternate
pronunciations and the word's language of origin.
</P>
<P>
   Michael characteristically thrust both of his hands in his
pockets _ ``I told him to do that (because otherwise) he hits the
microphone with his mouth,'' his mother said _ and spelled. He
missed the correct spelling by only one letter. Later, he said he
knew the root of the word was ``negotiate.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael said he would not come back to watch tomorrow's final,
but would instead enjoy the rest of the week touring Washington.

</P>
<P>
   TONYS-HERSCHER (New York) _ After a 50-year theatrical life
spanning several offstage careers _ as a general manager, a
producer, a music publisher, an agent _ Sylvia Herscher, 86, steps
into the spotlight Sunday night to receive a Tony award for
excellence. In a profile by Barry Singer, Jerry Herman, the
composer, describes her as the offstage embodiment of his greatest

</P>
<P>
   MOVIE-MUSICALS (New York) _ Wendy Wasserstein, the playwright,
believes that movie musicals defined romance and American
exuberance and are among the top ten reasons to live. She hopes

one of the best romantic comedies and some of the best songs ever
written.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; TELEVISION &LR;

   &UR; FILM &LR;
</P>
<P>
   WOMEN-FILMMAKERS (Undated) The need to discuss love and sex from
a female point of view coupled with a new freedom to do so seems to
be the launching pad for a gaggle of women-directed movies, many of
them first films, that portrays sex as both sadder and more
humorous than films made by males. Among the films that Molly
Haskell discusses are Colette Burson's ``Coming Soon,'' a female
rite-of-passage and right-to-orgasm film and ``The Virgin
Suicides,'' Sofia Coppola's recent adaptation of Jeffrey Eugenides'
1993 novel about five sisters. (moved 5/31)

<P>
   RAVE-FILM-MUSIC (Undated) ``Better Living Through Circuitry'' is
the latest of three new films, along with the recently released
``Human Traffic'' and ``Groove'' to celebrate the rave scene. A new

(moved 5/30)
</P>
<P>
   YOGA-MUSIC (New York) _ Yoga Journal recently called Krishna Da
``The Pavarotti of Kirtan.'' His most popular album, ``Pilgrim
Heart'' (1996), has sold nearly 50,000 copies. He has sung with
Sting and instructed Madonna. ``I think it's perfectly natural that
a Westerner should go to India, soak it up and come back and then
work with the forms they've absorbed in this lifetime, which for me
was Little Anthony and the Imperials and rock 'n' roll,'' said the
artist who was born Jeffrey Kagel in Long Island in 1947. By Ann
Powers. (moved 5/31) &QL;

   HAYNES-DRUMS-MUSIC (Undated) _ Ben Ratliff profiles the drummer

He has played with practically everybody of major significance
since the 1940s _ from Louis Armstrong to Thelonious Monk to
Charlie Parker and worked with the vocalists Sarah Vaughan, Billie
Holliday and Ella Fitzgerald. A lot of that history can be heard on
his new disc on Verve/Universal called simply, ``The Roy Haynes
Trio.'' (moved 5/30)
</P>
<P>
   MUSIC-EDUCATION (Cincinnati) _ Wes Craven's film ``Music of the
Heart'' and the new conservatory complex in Cincinnati tell us that
there is more to the current American classical-music scene than
empty seats and graying audiences. By David Schoenbaum. (moved
5/31)
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ART &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ARTS-BRAZIL (Sao Paulo) _ In the largest city in Latin America's

   TRAVEL-COOLIDGE-VERMONT (Undated) _ Christopher S. Wren visits

community of clapboard farmhouses and weathered barns seems to have
changed little since Calvin Coolidge was sworn in here as president
on Aug. 23, 1923, at 2:47 a.m. The wood stove and the kerosene
light in his home and the modest cemetery holding six generations
of Coolidges speak volumes about the man known as ``Silent Cal.''
(moved 5/29)
</P>
<P>
   TRAVEL-MAINE-WILDERNESS (Undated) _ Carey Goldberg asked the
question, ``How deep of a wilderness experience can be had in
Maine?'' and finds the answer. ``Pretty Deep.'' She writes of

hoots ...'' (moved 5/29)

<P>
   TRAVEL-PARKS-SMOG (Undated) _ As smog season begins, it is

 &HT;    Artist, sailor, pilot: She `has edge on Ted'
 &HT;    By Richard L. Eldredge
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   So who exactly is this woman that Ted Turner referred to Tuesday
as his ``girlfriend''? Anticipating your curiosity, Buzz spent some
time Wednesday digging up some facts on Frederique D'Arragon, the
50ish French-born artist who maintains homes in New York; Palm
Beach, Fla.; Rio de Janeiro, Brazil; and Paris.
</P>
<P>
   Porter Bibb, author of the biography ``Ted Turner: It Ain't as
Easy as It Looks,'' describes D'Arragon as independently wealthy,
intelligent and athletic.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's an artist and a very good sailor, pilot and polo
player,'' Bibb said in a telephone interview from New York. ``She's
probably the only woman who has got the edge on Ted, which
irritates him a lot. She's at least as smart and at least as good a
sailor as he is. She served on his crew on some of his
trans-Atlantic cruises in the '70s.''
</P>
<P>
   Bibb said D'Arragon (left) invited him to lunch when his book
was published in 1993 to ask for his help in setting up a gallery
showing of some of her work.
</P>
<P>
   ``She opened the portfolio, and the first thing she showed me
was a painting of Ted looking like Napoleon. The next ones were Ted
in historic poses as Admiral Nelson, Robert E. Lee and George
Washington. I asked her if Ted had seen these, and she said no. I
thought they would make great Christmas cards, but I couldn't help
her with a show. They were the kind of things you might see in Mad
magazine.''
</P>
<P>
   D'Arragon has been on the fringes of Turner's life all during
the Jane Fonda era, Bibb said. ``They really have had this kind of
competition and friendship for more than 20 years.''
</P>
<P>
   Bibb, meanwhile, is less than convinced that a divorce is the
solution for Turner and Fonda. The author says he believes the
couple will reconcile. ``I've known Jane since she was in Vassar.
Jane is his perfect match, and Frederique is not the wifely type.
She's never been married; she's a free spirit, and she likes living
her own life.''
</P>
<P>
   Together again
</P>
<P>
   Possibly supporting that reconciliation theory, Turner and Fonda
sat at adjacent tables Wednesday at CNN's annual ``World Report''
Conference at the Omni Hotel and greeted each other cordially with
mutual cheek kisses.
</P>
<P>
   Fonda showed international journalists a 15-minute film she
recently made in Nigeria about programs that empower adolescent
girls. ``The world is not a girl-friendly place,'' said Fonda, who
founded the Georgia Campaign for Adolescent Pregnancy Prevention.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Wednesday, Turner spoke to the ``World Report''
Conference, focusing on several of his favorite topics, including
nuclear disarmament, overpopulation and extinction of species.
</P>
<P>
   He said that on a recent visit to Russia, he was taken to
``Rocket Headquarters'' outside Moscow, the place where the Soviets
would have launched a nuclear attack against the United States.
Instead of a map of the United States on the wall, there was a sign
reading ``Welcome Ted Turner,'' but he was still warned by his
hosts: ``Don't push any buttons.''

DUMA GIVES OK TO DRAFT OF PUTIN'S PLAN TO CONCENTRATE POWER IN
KREMLIN 
</HEADLINE>
   By MICHAEL WINES   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Russia's lower house of parliament ignored misgivings
by political analysts and democracy advocates Wednesday and
resoundingly endorsed a first draft of President Vladimir Putin's
plan to concentrate state power in the Kremlin.
</P>
<P>
   The wave of support strongly suggested that Russia's upper house
of parliament, the Federation Council _ which stands to lose much
of its power to the Kremlin should the plan pass _ will be more or
less helpless to do anything about it.
</P>
<P>
   The lower house, or Duma, passed the first reading of Putin's
three-law proposal by a vote of 362-34.
</P>
<P>
   Nikolai Petrov, an expert on Russian regional political
structure at the Moscow Center of the Carnegie Endowment for
International Peace, said Wednesday night that the vote showed
Putin has control of the parliament firmly in his hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``His calculation was rather correct, and the Duma is clearly
backing the president in this,'' he said. ``It means it's very easy
for him to deal with the Federation Council.''
</P>
<P>
   Two more readings will occur in late June before the bills reach
a final vote, and once amendments are offered, that bloc of support
might split. But as long as the Kremlin keeps 300 votes in the
Duma, it can override any changes that the Federation Council might
attempt.
</P>
<P>
   Putin's proposals take dead aim at the governors who lead
Russia's 89 regions, a group which gained considerable independence
under President Boris Yeltsin and represents the major challenge
these days to Kremlin authority.
</P>
<P>
   His legislation would oust the governors from their guaranteed
seats on the Federation Council, where they hold 50 percent of the
vote, and also remove the local legislative leaders _often the
governors' allies _ who hold the remaining seats.
</P>
<P>
   They would be replaced by senators chosen by local legislatures
in a secret ballot.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday in the regional capital of Yaroslavl, Putin went a
step further, suggesting that a region's representation in the
Federation Council should be proportional to its contribution to
the federal till. Currently the council is composed of two
representatives from each region.
</P>
<P>
   In his proposal to parliament, Putin also seeks the authority to
remove governors if they pursue policies counter to federal law,
and to name a replacement of his own choosing. Some of these
firings would require a court hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Among other initiatives, the proposed laws would give governors
and regional legislatures the power to fire local officials who
violate laws, but give the president the right to name replacements
until new elections can be held.
</P>
<P>
   Putin has made restoring central authority a centerpiece of his
new presidency, and almost everyone here agrees, in principle. that
the Kremlin's grip on the levers of federalism is too weak. But
many are just as adamant that the latest plan moves much too far
toward making Putin or any successor not a democratic president,
but a Latin-style strongman.
</P>
<P>
   The Kremlin's plans are politically potent not just because they
would dilute the governors' influence in Moscow, but because they
also would give Putin powerful weapons to use against them. If the
threat of removal from office were not enough, the governors also
would lose the current immunity from criminal prosecution should
they lose their legislative seats.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The Kremlin also moved this month to carve Russia into seven
federal administrative regions, each to be overseen from a regional
capital by a Kremlin appointee answerable only to the president.
</P>
<P>
   Putin called the move, which he says does not need parliament's
approval, an effort to streamline an unwieldy federal bureaucracy.
But he has staffed the regions mostly with former officials of the
military and the federal intelligence services. More than a few see
in that a plan to rebuild federal offices in the regions into
centers of authoritarian control. One of the most visible critics
has been a business tycoon and Duma member, Boris Berezovsky, who
has often been called a behind-the-scenes power broker in the
Kremlin, both in former President Boris Yeltsin's administration
and in Putin's.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview published Wednesday in the weekly journal
Argumenty I Fakty, Berezovsky characterized Putin's plans as
well-intended but potentially fatal to representative democracy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, almost all of us have lived the greater part of
our lives in conditions of a totalitarian regime. The most baleful
consequence of this is the development of a psychology of slaves in
people,'' he said. ``But during the past 10 years, millions of
people, as a result of new, sometimes cruel and tragic
circumstances, have learned to stop counting on anybody's help.''
</P>
<P>
   Adopting Putin's plan to re-establish a powerful center, he
said, ``will strike a crushing blow at the changed consciousness of
millions of people, this main accomplishment of recent years.''
Berezovsky voted against the legislation Wednesday.

THE GEM OF THE TEXAS COAST OFFERS GREAT BIRDING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SOUTH PADRE ISLAND, Texas: tanagers, kingbirds and vireos. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   You'll hardly even need binoculars _ although they become
essential, once you're hooked _ to enjoy the feathered wonders seen
from the Laguna Madre Nature Trail adjacent to the island's
convention center, just north of town. (You can't miss the
building, painted with giant killer whales by the nature artist
known simply as Weyland.)
</P>
<P>
   Take a stroll on the nature trail boardwalk, which crosses a few
feet above a combination of tidal mud flat, freshwater marsh and
salt marsh _ keep an eye out for resident alligators _ and extends
dramatically a few hundred yards to the bay waters regularly called
the Laguna Madre. Along the route, you're nearly guaranteed
sightings (depending on season, of course) of deeply pink roseate
spoonbills, great blue herons, black and yellow rails, peregrine
falcons, warblers, buntings and orioles.
</P>
<P>
   Almost as prolific as bird species and birders are places to
camp along the copious birding trails. Travelers craving more
comfort have plenty of motels and condos to choose from on the
island and in the dozen or so Valley towns. But for an
unforgettable experience combining luxury and birding, nothing
compares to a stay at the Inn at Chachalaca Bend.
</P>
<P>
   Opened in May 1999, the six-room bed-and-breakfast inn for
birders rests inside 40 acres of natural landscape at Los Fresnos,
20 miles inland from South Padre Island. Its positioning in a bend
of the peaceful and lazy Resaca del las Antonias, a saltwater oxbow
fed by other waterways that eventually flow into the Laguna Madre,
is prized for its seclusion.
</P>
<P>
   Transformed from a 1970s family home in an impressive,
million-dollar renovation, the gorgeous inn is named for the
resident chachalaca, a rather regal brush bird native to South
Texas and Mexico. You'll wake in the morning, beneath plush Laura
Ashley bedding, to the chachalaca's wild clucking, and you can hike
along a 14-acre nature trail to custom-built blinds to watch it _
and dozens of other birds _ eat at a little pond created just for
feathered friends.
</P>
<P>
   Sunrises at Chachalaca Bend are great for climbing the
observation tower to look for alligators and turtles in the Resaca,
and sunsets are perfect for sitting at the gazebo next to a large
brushy prairie's pond to watch Altamira orioles, green jays,
buff-bellied hummingbirds, great kiskadees, ringed kingfishers and
roseate spoonbills. At night, you can review the day's sightings
over a glass of wine beside one of the landscaped fire pits.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to pull away from the flagstone patios and mahogany
verandas, shaded by white-bloomed olive trees and giant palms, but
it's only a 15-minute shot north to the grand Laguna Atascosa
National Wildlife Refuge. The 45,000-acre preserve on the Laguna
Madre is the Rio Grande Valley's largest protected habitat, with
nearly 400 recorded bird species. It's open daily and has hundreds
of miles of foot and driving routes on which to see everything from
vermilion fly-catchers to long-billed thrashers.
</P>
<P>
   One more group of nature lovers is drawn to the calm Laguna
Madre: saltwater fly-fishing enthusiasts, many of whom come from as
far as Alaska and New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fly-fishing gives so much more dimension to the sport; once
you catch fish on a fly rod, you'll never fish any other way,''
says Pete Moore, a South Padre Island attorney and president and
founder of the Laguna Madre Fly Fishing Association.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's something so aesthetically pleasing about seeing that
line when it's being cast,'' Moore says.
</P>
<P>
   Moore refers fly-fishing inquiries to such experts as Larry
Haines, owner of a fishing shop in Port Isabel and a noted
fly-fishing artist who paints commissioned works in pastels or
oils.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, Haines spends perhaps 300 days each year outfitting
fly-fishing clients, teaching newcomers how to cast or serving as a
fishing guide. He says the fishing is good year-round _ with
catches ranging from redfish, trout and tarpon to snook, kingfish
and dorado _ but that fall is prime time. He likes to paddle his
kayak into the bay, a tactic that makes for easy sneaking up on the
fish.
</P>
<P>
   Haines also cites a surging interest among women in fly-fishing,
noting that even his wife wouldn't fish with him on lures, but she
goes fly-fishing all the time.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the essence of fly-fishing that appeals to women, I
think,'' Haines says. ``You don't need strength _ it's just in
timing. It's a beautiful thing.''
</P>
<P>
   And you can be certain it's more soothing than wandering into a
tequila-shooting contest.
</P>

THE GEM OF THE TEXAS COAST OFFERS GREAT BIRDING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JUNE NAYLOR RODRIGUEZ 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SOUTH PADRE ISLAND, Texas _ Nearly the moment the Laguna Skimmer
pulls away from its slip at the Sea Ranch Marina, first mate
Scarlet Colley points at the sea-grass beds. There, paddling along
the water, are mother grebes, seabirds that look a lot like loons
and carry as many as three babies on their backs.
</P>
<P>
   ``And look, look!'' she adds with glee, as though she doesn't do
this every single day. ``See the red-breasted merganser? Isn't it
beautiful?''
</P>
<P>
   Colley is equally giddy over the native skimmer, with orange
legs and beak, which feeds while in flight by dropping its lower
mandible into the water. And just beyond the grasses and mangroves
that protect the shoreline, she watches for her ``babies,'' the
bottlenose dolphins that live and play in the tranquil Laguna
Madre, which separates South Padre Island from mainland Texas.
</P>
<P>
   It's a typical tour for this naturalist and her husband, George
Colley _ but it's light-years away from the human wildlife scene a
short distance down the island in spring. March, in fact, might be
the one time you'd avoid South Padre Island _ unless you're one of
the 175,000 college kids who enjoy spring break there, or you enjoy
their company.
</P>
<P>
   But, though many people associate South Padre solely with the
annual ritual of spring break, Texas' southernmost point has a lot
more going for it than tequila shots and boomboxes blaring the
latest Limp Bizkit hit.
</P>
<P>
   The other 11 months of the year are blissfully quiet around this
skinny, condo-lined spit of tortilla-hued sand, edged by a blue
bay, thick sea oats and crashing waves. And they're ideal for a
different kind of beach invader: the wildlife lover.
</P>
<P>
   Travelers can enjoy greater dolphin watching, birding and
fly-fishing than can be found anyplace else in Texas _ or the
entire Gulf Coast. The bonus, on and near the island, is a booming
choice in places to stay, ranging from upscale hotels and condo
developments to several new budget-priced motels and a quickly
growing bed-and-breakfast industry.
</P>
<P>
   Savvy travelers are finding experienced guides like the Colleys,
outfitters who take individuals or small groups onto the gentle
shallows of Laguna Madre. Calling themselves Fin to Feather Tours,
the naturalist team caters to novice watchers and skilled wildlife
photographers.
</P>
<P>
   With infectious enthusiasm, the couple share stories from five
years of filming and studying approximately 150 dolphins almost
daily. Unlike Sea World and other dolphin tours, they neither play
with nor feed the dolphins.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are wild, and we don't want to change them in any way,''
says Scarlet Colley, who, with her husband, teaches nature classes
at the nearby Pan-Am Coastal Studies Lab. ``They don't need food to
be interested in us. They're so curious, they come to us anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   In the course of a two- to three-hour tour, Scarlet and George
note with glee the surfacing of everyone from Can Opener, Natcho,
Cookie and Nipper to Titan and Baby. They've established dozens of
dolphins' identities by their dorsal fin shapes and markings, and
they easily rattle off fascinating tales, like the one about Baby,
who was orphaned before her mama taught her self-defense, and thus
lost part of a fin to a boat propeller.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the fun is watching the sleek, gray mammals in their
everyday joy. They jump boat wakes in perfect arches and often
cavort in pairs or threesomes, playing some kind of hopscotch over
one another or planting a kiss on each other midleap. They don't
need trainers; this is what they do naturally.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, watch for interaction between dolphins and birds. The
luckiest photographer might capture a dolphin tossing a fish
skyward to feed a hovering royal tern: nature in a moment of
entertainment and balance.
</P>
<P>
   The Colleys' birding tours have become as popular as the
dolphin-watching trips, Scarlet says. She has documented more than
50 bird species in Laguna Madre, which is hardly surprising when
you consider the overwhelming importance of the Rio Grande Valley
in the birding world.
</P>
<P>
   Millions of birds use the area as a refueling and resting stop
between homes in North and South or Central America. Of the
hundreds of species documented here, more than 30 are found no
other place in the United States. Experts point out that the four
Valley counties have more bird species than most states.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Rio Grande Valley is the No. 1 birding destination in the
U.S.,'' says Madge Lindsay, the state parks' project leader for the
future World Birding Center. ``It's on every serious bird-watcher's
list of places to go.''
</P>
<P>
   The World Birding Center will offer classes to aid the dedicated
birder as well as help the neophyte get started. Scheduled for a
2002 opening, the WBC will cover 10 sites in the Valley, with the
headquarters adjacent to Benson State Park at Mission, and it will
offer three nature lodges for overnight stays.
</P>
<P>
   In April, birders make their own migrations south for the Great
Texas Birding Classic, the nation's longest competitive
bird-watching event. Dozens of teams _ as well as thousands of
noncompetitive ``avi-tourists,'' as the tourism officials call them
_ flock from around the United States, Canada and Europe to see the
spring flight of birds to Gulf Coast marshes, estuaries, islands
and brushy woods. In addition to superb sightings of 350 or so
species each year, the event has raised $150,000 in four years to
buy and improve thousands of acres of bird habitats.
</P>
<P>
   The birders spend nearly two weeks navigating their way up the
Great Texas Coastal Birding Trail, a route that spans the
624-mile-long Texas Gulf Coast. Distinctive brown markers along the
way make it easy for birders to log their sightings.
</P>
<P>
   And no birder can do without the Rio Grande Valley Birding Map,
available at tourism offices throughout the area. Pinpointing 80
``hot spots'' in the Valley and on the lower coast, it provides
specific directions to such places as the Falcon State Park near
Roma, Sacahuista Flats near Port Mansfield and Tres Corrales Pond
near Raymondville. Even better, the map describes specific birds
found at those spots.
</P>
<P>
   A sensible stop _ No. 73 on this giant map _ for easy birding is
the island itself. In the Black Mangrove Tidal Flat, sitting right
at the island end of the long Queen Isabella Causeway that connects
the mainland, searchers find reddish egrets and American
oystercatchers. On the jetties at the island's south end, find
loons, gannets and frigate birds. And in vacant residential lots,
which local birders have managed to keep the city from mowing,
you'll find thrush, tanagers, kingbirds and vireos. MORE &QL;

 &HT;    Experts exploring ethical questions in live organ gifts
 &HT;    By Patricia Guthrie
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Atlantan Curt Bludworth willingly gave up a portion of his
liver to a stranger May 12, he added to the ethical complexities
confronting transplant surgeons.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty years ago, it was kidneys that relatives eagerly parted
with to save the life of a loved one. Now it's livers being shared
between strangers. What's next in this brave new world of living
organ donors, and who _ if anyone _ is overseeing it?
</P>
<P>
   Sponsored by the National Kidney Foundation and the American
Society of Transplant Surgeons, the first national discussion to
begin sorting through the ethical, medical and legal aspects of
living donation is under way today in Kansas City, Mo.
</P>
<P>
   About 125 transplant surgeons, medical ethicists, social workers
and organ donors and recipients are mulling the dilemmas that have
arisen as more healthy people undergo risky surgery to donate
organs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The transplant community has a responsibility to look at all
the issues raised by living donors,'' said Dr. Francis Delmonico,
director of renal transplantation at Boston's Massachusetts General
Hospital. ``The information we give our donors is critical to their
decision to proceed with the transplant or not.''
</P>
<P>
   Transplants from living donors tripled from 1989 to 1998,
according to the United Network for Organ Sharing. In 1998, there
were 4,273 living donors, and one in five transplanted organs came
from a live person. Kidneys and portions of livers and lungs are
the organs most commonly taken from a healthy person. They are
reattached inside a critically ill person who could have died
waiting for an organ from the traditional source, the deceased.
</P>
<P>
   About 68,000 Americans are waiting for an organ transplant.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors predict living donations could radically change the
field of transplantation. Nearly half the kidneys used at leading
transplant centers are coming from living donors, most of them
relatives.
</P>
<P>
   The laparoscopic technique used in kidney transplants poses far
less risk compared to living liver transplants, in which at least
one donor, possibly two, has died as a result of the lengthy and
invasive surgery.
</P>
<P>
   However, there is no federal oversight of living donors and no
private group that tracks the long-term health of living donors or
recipients. UNOS regulates only those organs coming from the
deceased.
</P>
<P>
   Transplant centers have been left to sort through the myriad
issues raised by living donors, such as assessing risk and benefit
and what constitutes informed consent.
</P>
<P>
   Only one rule is common to both kinds of transplants _ it is
against federal law to buy and sell organs.
</P>
<P>
   Most perplexing to centers is how to handle individuals such as
Bludworth, the ``good Samaritan'' donors who offer to put
themselves through surgery and recuperation for altruistic reasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``Traditionally, living donors have always been someone in the
family, so they received some of the benefit from the risk of
undergoing the surgery,'' says Jeffrey Kahn, director of the Center
for Bioethics at the University of Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   ``But altruistic strangers represent a complete splitting of
this risk and benefit. ... How much risk are we willing to put a
donor through to benefit a recipient?''
</P>
<P>
   After the conference, public hearings will be conducted on
proposals. Recommendations are expected by September.

<P>
   SHABAA, Lebanon _ Syria is ready to accept Israel's retreat last
week from southern Lebanon as a complete withdrawal, a United
Nations envoy said Wednesday, perhaps easing concerns that violence
along the Israeli-Lebanese border might resume.
</P>
<P>
   After a meeting in Damascus, the envoy, Terje Roed-Larsen, said
he and Foreign Minister Farouk al-Sharaa of Syria were in ``full
agreement on every matter'' concerning the withdrawal and could
decide soon how to deploy more U.N. peacekeeping troops in southern
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, he added, the Syrians agreed with a U.N. report
issued last week that said that Israel does not have to give up a
contested piece of territory of about 10 square miles at the far
southeastern corner of Lebanon _ land called Shebaa Farms _ in
order to comply with U.N. Resolution 425.
</P>
<P>
   That Security Council resolution dates from the 1982 Israeli
invasion of Lebanon and calls for Israel's withdrawal from land it
occupied at that time.
</P>
<P>
   Most of Shebaa Farms was occupied by Israel in 1967, after its
war with its Arab neighbors, and Israel has argued it is not
covered by Resolution 425.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement from Roed-Larsen suggested that Syria, which
exercises ultimate military and political control over Lebanon, has
decided to avoid a potentially costly escalation in tensions in the
Middle East by not challenging the United Nations over verification
of Israel's withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
   But the reaction in Lebanon was confused. The government and the
armed Hezbollah militia have threatened to continue attacking
Israeli targets if Shebaa Farms is not returned.
</P>
<P>
   Lebanon's prime minister, Selim al-Hoss, issued a statement
saying that he had also talked with Sharaa and was told that Syria
supports Lebanon's claim to Shebaa Farms. The official Syrian news
agency SANA also reported that Shara called on Israel to withdraw
from Shebaa Farms, either unilaterally or in accordance with other
U.N. resolutions related to Arab land it occupied in the 1967
Arab-Israeli war.
</P>
<P>
   A Hezbollah spokesman in Beirut said the militia was not ready
to comment on the statement by Roed-Larsen.
</P>
<P>
   The apparent conflict over whether Syria does or does not back
the Lebanese and Hezbollah position is more than a matter of
semantics.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of Hezbollah, the main guerrilla movement in the south,
have said they will not abandon their war until Israel gives up
Shebaa Farms, a mountainous stretch of land at the base of Mount
Hermon in the Golan Heights, and releases all Lebanese held in
Israeli jails.
</P>
<P>
   The Lebanese government, which has permitted the Iranian-backed
Islamic militia to operate freely in the south and has lauded it as
a national liberation force, has echoed the Hezbollah threats.
</P>
<P>
   But at the same time, both the government and Hezbollah are
tightly tied to Syria, which has some 30,000 soldiers and an
undisclosed number of intelligence agents in Lebanon. So a Syrian
decision to accept Israel's withdrawal as full compliance with
Resolution 425 would obligate both Lebanon and the militia to
follow suit.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   That Israel occupies Shebaa Farms, a stretch of land that
overlooks the Golan Heights and South Lebanon, is not in dispute.
The issue is the timing of Israel's occupation. It was seized in
1967, 15 years before the Israeli invasion of Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   As far as the U.N. resolutions are concerned, Shebaa Farms is
part of the land Israel seized from Syria along with the Golan
Heights. Lebanese officials have said they want all their land
restored, regardless of when it was occupied.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. officials, including Roed-Larsen, have said recently that
the ownership of Shebaa Farms is a matter to be decided between
Syria and Lebanon. The two countries have never agreed on an
international border between them.
</P>
<P>
   Shebaa Farms is a rocky mountainous tract along Lebanon's
southeastern border, strategic not only because it provides a view
onto the Golan Heights but also over south Lebanon and the Bekaa
Valley that runs between Syria and Lebanon. Seven small rivers that
feed into the Jordan River before it flows past Israel all converge
in a depression of the Shebaa Farms land.
</P>
<P>
   Before the 1967 war, the land contained a series of family-owned
farms where Lebanese peasants grew wheat and grazed their
livestock. But two weeks after the June 1967 war ended, Shebaa
Farms became a new battleground, its farmers driven from their
fields and homes by Israeli soldiers seeking a vantage point to
watch for incursions by Palestinian militants operating from south
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   Ahmed Ali, now 75, lived through the Israeli invasion. In an
interview in his home in Shebaa, a village perched on the hillside
just west of the farms, Ali said he remembers that he and his
relatives were harvesting their summer wheat when Israeli soldiers
appeared and sprayed the fields with machine-gun fire.
</P>
<P>
   One of Ali's cousins was killed. ``Then they made everyone leave
their homes and they destroyed them,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   His nephew, Yehiya Ali, has been collecting deeds and other
documents from the displaced owners of land in Shebaa Farms for the
past 15 years _ an effort that so annoyed the Israeli occupation
forces in southern Lebanon that they threw him in prison in 1987
for one week.
</P>
<P>
   Ali, who moved from Shebaa to Beirut two years after his
imprisonment and returned home only last week, has now revived his
effort to reclaim his family's land. He said some 10,000 Lebanese
used to live year-round on the land, including his own extended
family, and another 1,000 families farmed plots there but lived in
the town of Shebaa.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know this land is ours and it belongs to Lebanon,'' he said
Wednesday as he spread the documents out on a table in his uncle's
home.

   NEW YORK _ In a freshly painted warehouse on a quiet street in
the Long Island City section of Queens one recent spring evening,
passersby could glimpse an odd assortment of recognizable faces.
Chuck Close was hobnobbing with Michael Ovitz. Ileana Sonnabend,
the octogenarian gallery owner, was there along with the soprano
Renee Fleming, Mike Wallace of ``60 Minutes,'' the art critic
Robert Hughes, the singer and former Talking Head David Byrne, the
choreographer Merce Cunningham, the curator Walter Hopps, Martha
Stewart, the designer Edwin Schlossberg and Mathilde Krim, the
founding chairwoman of the American Foundation for AIDS Research.
</P>
<P>
   The host was easy to spot. Clad in a cream-colored linen suit,
Robert Rauschenberg, the 75-year-old artist, was boisterously
greeting his guests. Some were old friends, he said; others he had
never met before.
</P>
<P>
   ``These people aren't friends or allies or conspirators or
comforters,'' said Rauschenberg. ``They are a group of people
picked for their diverse interests.'' At the artist's side was his
dealer, Arne Glimcher, who is chairman of the PaceWildenstein
Gallery, along with Maxwell L. Anderson, director of the Whitney
Museum of American Art. Also present were Leonard A. Lauder, the
Whitney's chairman, and Marla Prather, the museum's curator of
postwar art.
</P>
<P>
   The guests had been invited to take part in what Rauschenberg
called a game of visual gambling. But the setting looked more like
a dinner party than a casino, what with a jazz duo playing in the
background, a bar, a buffet and tables decorated with vases of
peonies. Lining the walls of the warehouse were 52 panels, each
nine and a half feet high but varying in width. All were adorned
with hand-painted passages as well as Rauschenberg's familiar
photographic images: everything from a Coca-Cola bottle to a fire
hydrant to an automobile tire.
</P>
<P>
   Together, the panels form ``Synapsis Shuffle,'' the artist's
latest work, which extends more than 220 feet and is his biggest
after ``The 1/4 Mile or 2 Furlong Piece,'' a work in progress that,
at last count, was made up of 206 panels.
</P>
<P>
   Like a deck of cards, the panels of ``Synapsis Shuffle'' are
meant to be assembled by a different group of people every time
they are shown so the work will never be seen the same way twice.
The 12 guests were the first to create a version of ``Synapsis
Shuffle'' for an exhibition opening at the Whitney on June 29.
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of the exercise,'' Rauschenberg said, is to ``share the
decisions artists have to make themselves when creating a work of
art.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But the piece is really about the element of chance,'' he
added. ``At first I thought we should ask the first 12 taxi drivers
who passed the museum to put panels together. Instead, we chose
people with diverse interests to encourage as much controversy as
possible. Even though everyone can trade panels like baseball
cards, the evening may end in a fistfight. I guess this is bringing
out the devil in me.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Synapsis Shuffle'' took a year to complete, and Rauschenberg
said he envisioned that it would end up in a number of different
collections. That is, until Glimcher approached the Whitney, hoping
the museum might purchase the entire work. Glimcher, Lauder and
Prather traveled to Rauschenberg's studio in Captiva Island, Fla.,
where they tried to put together ``Synapsis Shuffle'' themselves.
By the end of the visit, Lauder had agreed to buy the work, which
experts say is worth $9 million to $10 million. He has made it a
promised gift to the Whitney.
</P>
<P>
   ``Walking into Bob's studio was like walking into a fairyland,''
Lauder recalled. ``Lined up on the walls were 52 individual
masterpieces. I felt it was vital for the museum to have something
like this.''
</P>
<P>
   As soon as all the guests had been given a chance to study the
panels, Prather announced the rules of the evening: In order to
produce 12 compositions from the 52 panels in a way that was fair
to everyone, the participants _ in alphabetical order _ drew a
series of numbered tags from a silver hat belonging to
Rauschenberg; the numbers drawn indicated how many panels each
person could work with _ from three to seven _ and in what order
each would choose panels.
</P>
<P>
   While most of the participants were visibly anxious about what
numbers they would pick, Sonnabend was not, having plotted her
strategy well in advance. ``I'm going to choose the panels that are
left over,'' she said. ``For years after a show I'd always buy what
nobody else wanted. They were always the most difficult pieces, but
in the end they became the strongest.''
</P>
<P>
   Ovitz was intent on putting together as coherent a composition
as possible. The first panel he chose had a blank canvas propped on
an easel on its top portion and the image of a closed, shuttered
door below. ``I love the concept of the blank easel,'' he said.
``Now the problem is to find something to go with it.''
</P>
<P>
   As Rauschenberg predicted, bartering was inevitable. Wallace
wanted one of Close's panels because the composition worked
especially well with another he had selected. After considerable
haggling the two cut a deal: Close agreed to relinquish one of his
panels to Wallace if he would promise in writing that Morley Safer
would not be allowed to do any more art segments on ``60 Minutes''
or ``CBS News Sunday Morning.'' A sheet of paper was produced, and
the agreement was drawn up and signed. Only then was the desired
panel turned over to Wallace.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the participants had strong ideas about how they wanted
their works to look. Krim, for example, chose two of her allotted
three panels because she said they were colorful and full of life:
the images included a crowd scene, a crowded bus and a field of
flowers. But somewhere in her composition she wanted to show
desolation and emptiness to symbolize the devastation of AIDS. With
Rauschenberg's permission, she turned the panel she liked least
backward, so that it faced the wall. The back of the canvas, with
its metal stretchers, resembled a ladder, and Glimcher pointed out
that her composition was similar to a 1959 painting by Rauschenberg
called ``Winter Pool,'' which incorporates a ladder between two
panels.
</P>
<P>
   Krim wasn't the only person with a mind of her own. Once she had
selected her allotted four panels, Fleming decided they looked best
turned horizontally rather than vertically. She asked
Rauschenberg's permission. Again it was granted.
</P>
<P>
   Others made an effort to create compositions that were in
keeping with the artist's spirit. Byrne asked if he could use the
silver hat in his composition. ``It's a Bob thing,'' he said
referring to the artist's use of found objects.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   One of the quietest participants was Cunningham. He made his
selections in much the same way he said he has choreographed his
dances for the last 40 years: by tossing a set of eight-sided dice
he found in a notions store in Minneapolis.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always take them with me when I'm on tour,'' Cunningham
said. ``Like the I Ching, I make a number of separate maneuvers
using this chance operation. It's a game, but it's a wonderful
game. Like a gambler I accept whatever comes up.''
</P>
<P>
   But the four panels in his effort _ with imagery ranging from an
Indian in full headdress to a lily pond _ seemed to belong together
in terms of their color scheme and composition.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   When ``Synapsis Shuffle'' is assembled at the Whitney _ the
museum is devoting the entire second floor to showing it _ labels
will credit each person's composition. When it comes down on Oct.
8, it will be lent to other museums. Each time it is, it will be
assembled by a different group of people invited by the artist.
</P>
<P>
   When the evening wound down and all the participants had
finished assembling their panels, Rauschenberg seemed pleased with
the outcome. Several days later he was uncharacteristically coy
when asked to critique the group's work, saying simply that ``some
did better than others.''
</P>
<P>
   He did add, however, that one day ``Synapsis Shuffle'' would
enable him to play out one of his greatest fantasies: ``to walk
into someone's home or into a museum and be able to say, `Gosh,
that's the worst Rauschenberg I've ever seen.'''  &QL;

HIGHER INTEREST FORCES AUTOMAKER TO END LOW-RATE LOANS
</HEADLINE>
 By KEITH BRADSHER  
c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ Feeling the effects of rising interest rates,
DaimlerChrysler announced on Wednesday that it would eliminate most
low-rate loans on new Chrysler, Dodge and Plymouth automobiles on
June 1 and instead offer bigger cash rebates to consumers and new
discounts to dealers.
</P>
<P>
   For most models, DaimlerChrysler currently offers customers a
choice of a cash rebate or a loan at a subsidized rate. During
June, however, the automaker will stop offering low-rate loans on a
national basis, although it will still make them available in some
very competitive regional markets, notably in the Northeast.
</P>
<P>
   DaimlerChrysler's shift is an indication that the Federal
Reserve's six increases in short-term interest rates are beginning
to put pressure on the auto industry. Economists say that one
reason the Fed's rate increases have not had more effect on auto
sales until now is that automakers have been offsetting the higher
rates. Automakers make low-rate loans available by paying subsidies
to banks and other providers of car loans.
</P>
<P>
   Automakers say that the Fed's rate increases have begun to slow
auto sales, with the industry likely to post May results on
Thursday that will show the first drop in year-to-year sales since
the summer of 1998, when a strike crippled General Motors.
</P>
<P>
   While the drop is expected to be just 2 percent or so, and while
sales remain at a level that would have been considered extremely
strong until the last couple of years, the drop could nonetheless
be a sign that the auto market has turned.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed's rate increases have led to increases in retail loans,
making it very expensive for automakers to hold down rates on auto
loans through subsidies to lenders, said Theodor R. Cunningham,
DaimlerChrysler's executive vice president for global sales and
marketing. DaimlerChrysler anticipates that short-term rates will
rise another half a percentage point to a full percentage point by
the end of this year, which could have made low-rate loans even
more expensive if the company had not switched to a greater
reliance on rebates, he added.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is part of a long-term strategy of shifting to get our
investment in incentives directly into the hands of consumers
instead of financial institutions,'' Cunningham said. The new
policy on incentives will be in effect throughout June.
</P>
<P>
   Cunningham said that it was not possible to calculate the effect
of the new policy on the company's total costs for discounts. The
discounts will be based on how many more vehicles each dealership
sells in June than in previous months.
</P>
<P>
   DaimlerChrysler had very few incentives in May, only to see
sales plunge 15 percent in the weeks leading up to the Memorial Day
weekend. Joseph Phillippi, an auto analyst at PaineWebber, said
that while DaimlerChrysler's new approach would raise the company's
costs, it might be cheaper than a return to the discount programs
that DaimlerChrysler had earlier this year and which the Ford Motor
Co. and GM continue to offer.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to scratch your head and wonder what's going to
happen when we have even a 5 percent downturn, which is not that
big _ it's going to get ugly out there,'' Phillippi said.
</P>
<P>
   GM and Ford officials said that they would study
DaimlerChrysler's approach. Foreign automakers offer fewer rebates,
preferring to set prices in line with market demand instead of
setting prices high and then discounting them.
</P>
<P>
   The new DaimlerChrysler rebates for consumers are the largest
for models that have not been updated for several years and are
about to be replaced. The rebate on the Chrysler Town &AMP; Country
minivan, for example, rises to $2,000 from an already hefty $1,750.
DaimlerChrysler also announced a $1,000 rebate on Dodge Durango
sport utility vehicles with 4.7-liter and 5.2-liter engines and a
$2,000 rebate on Durangos with 5.8-liter engines.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, consumers were snapping up the biggest sport
utility vehicles. Cunningham said that rising gasoline prices had
begun to erode demand for the largest sport utilities and increased
demand for small cars, but that the Fed's rate increases had been
far more important for auto sales than gasoline prices. &QL;

HAPPY FOR SMALL BLESSINGS, THE MARKET ONLY GIVES A LITTLE BACK FROM
RALLY 
</HEADLINE>
   By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr.    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   NEW YORK _ After adding modestly to Tuesday's record percentage
gain, Nasdaq stock prices fell in the final hour Wednesday to
finish with a 1.7 percent loss as investors digested further
evidence of a slowing economy and girded themselves for a crucial
employment report Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq composite index ended 58.57 points lower at 3,400.91.
Other major gauges traded in a relatively narrow range and ended
nearly unchanged. The blue-chip Dow Jones industrial average edged
down 4.80 points, to 10,522.33, while the Standard &AMP; Poor's
500-stock index eased 1.85 points, or 0.13 percent, to 1,420.60.
</P>
<P>
   ``The positive note is that we did not give back a lot'' of the
post-holiday rally, said Michael Strauss, a managing director of
Commonfund, an investment pool for college endowments. On the other
hand, he added, the market was pleased with reports of lower home
sales and less industrial inflation in the Midwest, ``but couldn't
do anything with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Stock prices mostly moved sideways _ and with little obvious
pattern _ except that investors seemed to welcome the opportunity
to lighten positions in high-technology concerns, while bidding up
shares of household names, like Wal-Mart, which leaped 4\, to 57|,
the biggest positive contributor to the Dow and the S&AMP;P 500.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the economy is going to downshift to a lower gear, you
don't want to own a whole load of technology stocks,'' said Ned
Riley Jr. chief strategist at State Street Global Advisors. Riley
examined trading blocks of at least 5,000 shares, and calculated
that retail investors accounted for 70 percent of the activity in
the top 10 Nasdaq stocks Wednesday, even though they held only 57
percent of the shares.
</P>
<P>
   Utilities and brokerage firms were among Wednesday's leaders.
Timothy M. Stevenson, a senior portfolio manager at the First
Capital Group, said the performance of brokerage firms was ``a vote
of confidence'' in the market outlook. Merrill Lynch gained 4, to
98|, Morgan Stanley Dean Witter 4{, to 71{, and Dain Rauscher 2|,
to 59|.
</P>
<P>
   Stevenson was also upbeat about market breadth, with 1,719
issues advancing on the New York Stock Exchange compared with 1,287
that declined. Among the S&AMP;P 500, however, losers outnumbered
winners by 268 to 213, the biggest drags on the index being Cisco
Systems, down 2 15/16, to 56 15/16, and Qualcomm, down 10, to 66].
</P>
<P>
   Hewlett-Packard, which skidded 4 5/16, to 120 3/16, was the
biggest drag on the Dow.

WEATHER CASTS A PALL OVER FRENCH OPEN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BUD COLLINS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ They looked like Les Miserables, the homeless of Paris,
30,000 soaked and sodden lost souls huddled at Stade Roland Garros,
waiting for the rain to stop Tuesday. It never did. For the only
time in the 75-year-old French Championships, not a single tennis
ball was smacked.
</P>
<P>
   Rain had often interfered, but never triumphed. However, after
nine hours the long-suffering were liberated, sent home clammy and
coughing, and promised refunds. The proprietor, the French
Federation, collected $1 million in a rain insurance payoff, and
five champions slept soundly, probably never dreaming it would be
their last night in town. For three it was.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday appeared cold and shrouded in gray, ominous for the
names _ Carlos Moya, Sergi Bruguera, Lindsay Davenport _ who had
ruled major citadels. But hopeful for no-names, too, such as Erika
de Lone, who had ``waited 11 years'' for such a day: ``my first win
in Paris.''
</P>
<P>
   And for a scrawny Belgian named Dominique Monami Van Roost, so
distraught at her mother's death three months ago that she didn't
want to continue playing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am crying and laughing,'' Dominique said after celebrating
her 27th birthday by overcoming the Wimbledon and Australian Open
champ, No. 2 Davenport, 6-7 (5-7), 6-4, 6-3. ``Usually I cry just
when I lose. But I think this was a wonderful victory mentally,
because I fought within myself these last months. I was not sure I
would start playing again.''
</P>
<P>
   It was one of a panoply of 79 matches spread across 22 crimson
dirt courts from morning till nightfall as the strivers threatened
the mighty, and an anonymous unshaven Frenchman, wild card Anthony
Dupuis, No. 108, thought, wrongly, that he was surely beating the
reigning champion, Andre Agassi. His victory dance was premature.
</P>
<P>
   The jigging Dupuis believed he had taken the opening set
tiebreaker on an ace as his serve whizzed past Agassi. But it
grazed the tape: a let. ``I knew it would be a let as soon as he
served it,'' said Agassi, who, well within himself, debuted with a
7-6 (9-7), 6-3, 6-4 win. ``But the guy told me afterwards that he'd
wished for 10 years to be on a court with me. That was nice.''
</P>
<P>
   But if the gallant Davenport, grimacing in pain and hobbled by
back spasms, could consider herself a spiritual winner after a
losing struggle of 2 1/4 hours, the never gallant _ though gifted _
Chilean, Marcelo Rios, once No. 1 for a few fleeting minutes two
years ago, presented a stark contrast on a nearby court. He
surrendered after two listless sets and 66 minutes against Tommy
Haas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's good to quit after two sets if you haven't
been hurt,'' said Haas, the young German trained at Nick
Bollettieri's boot camp in Florida. ``But I think we all know how
Marcelo is. I don't think he really cares what other people
think.''
</P>
<P>
   Fans who watched Rios splash unprofessionally twice at the US
Pro know what Haas means. Rios said his legs were sore _ ``I think
I'm not here to win one match. I'm here to try to win the
tournament. If I'm not feeling good it makes no sense to play.''
</P>
<P>
   It made sense to do-or-die Davenport, who strained her back at
the Italian Open and ``probably came back a week too soon. I was
feeling pretty good until the last game of the second set when I
hit a serve, and my back went into spasms again, which has been the
problem the last couple of weeks. Then I had trouble reaching up
for the serve.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a tough call about retiring or trying to play through it.
Dominique was playing well. She might have beaten me if I'd been
100 percent. It's the first time I've played a major with something
really wrong. But I really wanted to play. I've never quit a
match.''
</P>
<P>
   Davenport was the first No. 2 to fall in the first round since
Virginia Wade was beaten by Louisianan Linda Tuero in 1971. ``I'm
just going to rest,'' Davenport said, ``and I'm sure I'll be ready
for Wimbledon.''
</P>
<P>
   Gone was her shot at this year's Grand Slam. ``The French has
been my goal since I've won the other three majors,'' she said.
``But my mind-set was to just survive out there today.'' That she
did, in reputation as a true-blue champ.
</P>
<P>
   Lindsay's conqueror, No. 20 Van Roost, was nursed back to mental
stability by her live-in coach, husband Bart Van Roost, after her
mother's long ordeal with cancer. ``We had to work hard, very hard
for me to get back,'' she said. ``Down deep I felt I didn't want to
be hurt again. But everything came together two or three days ago.
I have a lot of luck to have a husband like Bart, a real support.''
</P>
<P>
   Dominique and Bart were the Juliet and Romeo of Belgium when
they married to the tune of great ``political disapproval,'' she
said. She is Walloon, he Flemish. ``For many Belgians it is a no-no
to mix the two. But people get over that.''
</P>
<P>
   The Spanish kings of France, Bruguera (1992-93) and Moya (1998),
were chased by peasants named Juan Balcells, a No. 97 qualifier,
and Hernan Gumy, No. 88.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ah, he's a cuddly Gummy bear,'' proclaimed a female viewer as
the handsome Argentine outlasted Moya, 7-6 (7-4), 6-2, 4-6, 3-6,
6-3, in 3 hours 37 minutes. ``Just a warmup _ remember '98?'' said
Gumy, who lost the most unending of French jousts, to Alex Corretja
in 5:31 two years ago. Balcell's act of lese majeste against
Bruguera _ 6-3, 5-7, 6-2, 1-6, 6-0 _ was even more pronounced since
he, too, is a Spaniard.
</P>
<P>
   But two endangered kings escaped. Michael Chang, the prodigy at
17 in 1989, is spinning his once-marvelous wheels these days, but
won his second-rounder over Swede Thomas Johansson, 7-6 (7-2), 7-6
(7-5), 2-6, 6-3. Russian Yevgeny Kafelnikov, victorious in 1996,
and tied with Rios in the sourness league, finished sweetly enough
over yet another of those rising Argentines, Mariano Zabaleta, 6-2,
3-6, 6-7 (6-8), 6-4, 6-4.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe none of them felt better than the young woman playing for
a gathering 43 of the day's 32,229 patrons, way out in the boonies,
Court 20. That was dauntless campaigner de Lone of Lincoln, Mass.,
with ``the best win of my life'' _ 6-3, 6-2 over the sturdy
Austrian lefthander, Barbara Schwartz, who toppled Venus Williams a
year ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I waited a long time for my first win in Paris,'' said de
Lone. ``Eleven years. I usually lost in qualifying. But I did
qualify twice, but then didn't win. But I didn't have to do that
this year with my No. 75 ranking.''
</P>
<P>
   As she hooked a troublesome serve on match point, her
stepfather, John Plukas, murmured, ``Now I can breathe again.''
</P>
<P>
   So could the French Open, recovered from the Tuesday deluge.

   Editors, managing editors, wire editors:
</P>
<P>
   Beginning Sunday, and continuing for six weeks, The New York
Times will publish a series of articles, ``How Race Is Lived in
America.''
</P>
<P>
   Two generations after the end of legal discrimination, race
still ignites political debates _ over Civil War flags, for
example, or police profiling. But the wider public discussion of
race relations seems muted by a full-employment economy and by a
sense, particularly among many whites, that the times of large
social remedies is past. Race relations are being defined less by
political action than by daily experience, in schools, in sports
arenas, in pop culture and at worship, and especially in the
workplace. These encounters _ relations in the most literal,
everyday sense _ make up this series of reports.
</P>
<P>
   The series is the outcome of a yearlong effort by a team of
Times reporters to capture some of the troubling issues that
Americans continue to face and the voices of ordinary people.
</P>
<P>
   These stories, two or three each week, are long, at 6,000 words
and up. They will move on the News Service wire the day before
publication and will carry a slug of the form BC-RACE-SLUG-NYT. In
addition, the News Service will file an abridged version of each
story, approximately half the length of the original.
</P>
<P>
   Here is a brief description of the first three articles.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, June 4:
</P>
<P>
   RACE-CHURCH (Decatur, Ga.) _ Nearly 50 years after the Rev. Dr.
Martin Luther King Jr. scolded Christians for making 11 a.m Sunday
the most segregated hour of the week, the Assembly of God
Tabernacle here is the rarest of religious institutions: a truly
integrated church in the heart of the South. And yet, the
Tabernacle is deeply conservative, socially and theologically. What
draws its members is the intensity of their Pentacostal faith,
which teaches that the Holy Spirit can move in the lives of all
believers, regardless of background. By Kevin Sack.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, June 5:
</P>
<P>
   RACE-IMMIGRANTS (Miami) _ Before they left Cuba for America in
1994 Joel Ruiz, who is black, and Achmed Valdes, who is white, were
the best of friends. Today, in Miami, the two men live only four
miles apart, not even 15 minutes by car. Yet they are separated by
a far greater distance, one they say they never envisioned back in
Cuba. In ways that are obvious to the black man but far less so to
the white one, they have grown apart in the U.S. because of race.
For the first time, they inhabit a place where the color of their
skin defines the outlines of their lives _ where they live, the
friends they make, how they speak, what they wear, even what they
eat. By Mirta Ojito.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, June 7:
</P>
<P>
   RACE-MILITARY (Fort Knox, Ky.) _ On a chill December morning,
two soldiers _ one black, one white, both part of an institution
portrayed as a model of race relations _ stood only yards apart in
the middle of this sprawling base, each believing himself the
victim of racism; one because of an award, the other because of a
transfer. The Army is not supposed to harbor racial resentment
anymore. Its work force is integrated. The Army is one of the few
institutions in America in which blacks routinely boss around
whites, and supposedly no one gives it a second thought. But that
is an idealized image. The Pentagon has found that two-thirds of
its men and women had experienced a racially offensive encounter in
the previous 12 months. And those findings are more or less
mirrored here at Fort Knox. By Steven A. Holmes.
</P>
<P>
   We will update this advisory later in the week.

YET ANOTHER NEW ROLE FOR A PATRIOTS' STALWART 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ ``Did you know you were Adrian Klemm's idol growing
up?'' Willie McGinest was asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who's Adrian Klemm?'' said McGinest.
</P>
<P>
   ``The team's second-round draft pick out of Hawaii, Willie. He
grew up in the Los Angeles area and idolized you as a kid.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the guy who must be punching me in the face everyday
and holding on to my jersey,'' said McGinest.
</P>
<P>
   McGinest was kidding, we think. The Patriots' defensive
end/linebacker, whatever he is in Bill Belichick's defense, is
experiencing tunnel vision at minicamp. If he hasn't had time to
socialize with Klemm and other young teammates, you'll have to
excuse him. He's trying to learn his fifth defense since being
drafted by the Patriots in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a compliment,'' said McGinest about comments by the
rookie tackle. ``It makes me go at him a little harder. That's a
compliment, though.''
</P>
<P>
   It's been a compliment to McGinest that each coach he's played
for has made him the focal point of the defense. It happened at USC
and here under Bill Parcells, who changed McGinest from a
linebacker to a defensive end. Pete Carroll then changed him into
an ``elephant'' in his defensive scheme.
</P>
<P>
   McGinest is the stud in the Patriots' front seven, responsible
for disrupting the opposing quarterback. He's been to the Pro Bowl.
He's also suffered the frustrations of being injured, a frustration
that finally ended last season when he stayed healthy for 16 games.
</P>
<P>
   Belichick is also asking McGinest to do something different. In
the role of elephant, he was a mobile defensive end who'd move in
and out of coverages and also rush the passer. Now he's at the line
of scrimmage. He's up, not down, and he acts like an outside
linebacker.
</P>
<P>
   ``Linebacker-defensive end. I don't know my title yet,'' said
McGinest. ``I'm still learning. I'm doing a lot of things to be
disruptive _ pressure the quarterback and make plays. A specific
role? A specific title? I don't really have one. I'm a linebacker,
a d-end. I'm interchangeable. Keeps guys guessing. Guys can't say
he's going to be here on a play or there. It's a little different
from elephant because I'm going to have to know what the
linebackers are doing and certain calls and checks.''
</P>
<P>
   Ah, so he is a linebacker?
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't ask me. I don't know,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   On offense, veterans have found a resemblance to the '96 offense
when current offensive coordinator Charlie Weis worked as a
receivers, running backs, and tight ends coach. Defensive players
also see similarities to the '96 scheme, when Belichick was the
assistant head coach in charge of the secondary, although the new
head coach keeps adding wrinkles. They also see glimpses of the
Jets' defense of last season that Belichick ran.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a little different,'' said McGinest. ``Some of the calls
are changed a little bit. He's added a lot. He's constantly
changing things, especially coming from another AFC team you can't
have the exact same system. It's a whole new thing for the coaches.
We're all new to it as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't watch the Jets' defense much last year because I
usually concentrate on their offense, but there have been times
I've seen the Jets bring five or six linebackers. That stuff is
confusing. If guys can take all that in, we can use it to our
advantage. The most important thing is to grasp it and go through
the motions. We have to get to the point where we don't have to
think twice about it.''
</P>
<P>
   McGinest doesn't know what he's going to find when he comes to
work.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who knows man? Right now I'm just a spoke on the wheel,'' he
said. ``We all have different roles. We're all going to have time
to get after it. I have my special plays. I was talking to one of
the guys before practice and I was just watching (Belichick). So
much stuff goes through his mind. He's constantly working. When
we're off, he's still here. You might have one defense and he might
wipe it out and have something completely different the next day.''
</P>
<P>
   You can tell McGinest's mood is changing. He was not a happy man
last year. Not when the Patriots went 2-6 the second half of the
season. He was the most vocal defensive player concerning the
team's shortcomings, especially following a humiliating loss to the
Philadelphia Eagles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anybody who expects to be successful and win games and be put
out of the playoffs after one game or not make the playoffs at all
shouldn't be happy or accept that,'' he said. ``We used the last
game as a steppingstone. We're just the team we were last year
until we prove otherwise. You have to go out and prove it to the
teams we're playing against that we're different now.''
</P>
<P>
   He has no way of knowing what the 2000 Patriots will look like,
except that the atmosphere has changed. The gloom and doom is gone,
at least for now. But he will never knock Carroll because his ways
``worked for him in San Francisco. Pete was a good coach,''
McGinest said. ``It just didn't work out. Just like it doesn't work
out for some players. Business decisions have to be made on that
level. All I have to worry about is what I'm doing.''
</P>
<P>
   McGinest says Belichick is ``business-like'' and expects things
to be done right, but ``he's not a robot. He jokes around and has
fun, too. It's not completely serious all the time,'' he said. ``He
says players need to have structure and guidance and know what
their limitations are. He sees those things in place at a time when
he feels the team needs them most.''
</P>
<P>
   Although McGinest has spent most of the offseason working on his
conditioning, he'll soon leave for California and then Vancouver so
physical therapists can help him prevent problems with his groin,
which had been troublesome to him in '97 and '98.
</P>
<P>
   But maybe when McGinest comes back, after he learns the new
defense, he can chat with Adrian Klemm.

online magazine of politics and culture, is available from the New
York Times Syndicate. Please contact syndicate sales representative

   &UR; BY SCOTT SHUGER &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The name of the media game right now is ``strategic alliance.''
Two relatively new Web-intensive media alliances involve major
newspapers and TV networks and are using the election as the main
subject matter for their corporate pollen-swapping: a Washington
Post-NBC join-up and one involving The New York Times and ABC.
</P>
<P>
   The hope in such ventures is to achieve synergistic fabulousity,
a la Toyota/General Motors. The fear is that the resources of both
companies will be strained in the bargain and that their cultures
won't happily mix.
</P>
<P>
   In the Washington Post-NBC deal, the paper seems to be giving
more than it's getting, as least so far. Post stories appear on the
MSNBC home page, and Post writers turn up with increased frequency
on such shows as ``The News With Brian Williams.'' (Ditto for
Newsweek, which is also part of the deal.) At this point what NBC
gets is mainly an instant credibility upgrade.
</P>
<P>
   The situation is slightly different with Times-ABC, which
attempts a more seamless meld of the two organizations' assets with
a daily live 15-minute interview and political news Webcast,
``Political Points.''
</P>
<P>
   But even here the Times seems to have a firmer hand, with the
paper's reporters hosting the show most of the time and asking most
of the questions (though some also come from the ABC reporters who
regularly participate and from online viewers).
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, on ``Political Points'' the values of print seem to be
keeping the values of television happily in check. Yes, there's the
overblown intro fanfare and the drumbeat of TV-style pluggery, but
the production values and haircuts are refreshingly terrible. Even
with a broadband connection, the sound somehow travels faster than
the picture, making everyone on the show resemble a character in a
Hong Kong martial arts flick.
</P>
<P>
   When the Times' Johnny Apple appeared on the maiden Webcast back
in January to explain in good detail the difference between a
primary and a caucus, he was the most rumpled and least animated
man to appear on television since Dick Cavett had a guest die. This
is great! When form falters, content has a much better chance.
</P>
<P>
   And the newspaper folks have been exhibiting a concision that's
unheard of on the weekend chat shows, with the result that viewers
get more questions answered. (But let's not get carried away here _
the show is also just another venue where, for example, Sen. Chuck
Hagel recently did not talk about his vice-presidential
conversations with the Bush campaign.)
</P>
<P>
   The Post appears likely to take pride of place in its hook-up
too. The pieces reporters have been providing for the newspaper's
Web site between one day's hard copy and the next are
indistinguishable from those that run in the paper. And for the
most part, the cogency of the paper's marquee reporters like David
Broder and Howard Kurtz still comes across in live Web forums with
readers.
</P>
<P>
   But there are threats to quality journalism here. First, if the
secret to making the new ventures good is using the newspaper
people as much as possible, then there will be the temptation to
overuse them, with the result that they'll do much less well at
everything, including their main newspaper jobs.
</P>
<P>
   There have already been hints of this trouble at The Washington
Post where reporters have sometimes chafed at having to take time
out of their reporting to file a Web story. (And at having to do
this for no extra pay.) At the Post, although it's not absolutely
obligatory to help fill the Web maw, reporters tend to feel that it
will reflect badly on them at performance-review time if they
don't.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Oreskes, the Times's Washington bureau chief, says no
one at his paper is required to appear on the daily Webcast, yet
certainly the presence on the show of many of the paper's hot
runners sends a clear message.
</P>
<P>
   But Oreskes says he's very mindful of dilution. ``I believe,''
he says, ``that protecting journalistic standards is the single
biggest issue as journalism moves on to the Web.''
</P>
<P>
   Second, everything will change if the scale of these operations
changes. Right now, newspapers are finding it relatively easy to do
things their way: Where reporters' stuff has ended up hasn't
affected what they do or how they do it.
</P>
<P>
   But this may just be the freedom of movement that comes from
flying below the network radar. For while these new ventures are
seen as having increased the reach of the papers (especially in the
case of the Post, which has no national distribution), they have
not as yet done much for the TV partners' audiences. But if these
ventures ever actually produce revenue, especially as steadily
improving broadband capability makes the Web more watchable, then
the TV sides will start trying to make the broadcasts more TV-like
by cramming 5 pounds of information into a 30-pound sack.
</P>
<P>
   And as the chat shows have shown, celebrity, although good for
journalists, has been bad for journalism. If the Web sites and
Webcasts become additional sources of celebrity for reporters, they
will become yet additional sources of adulteration.
</P>
<P>
   When the Post deal was announced, the paper's executive editor,
Leonard Downie Jr., was asked about NBC working its way into his
paper. ``TV people perform best on TV,'' he responded. In other
words, newspaper people think their ultimate defense against any
threats to quality created by the joint ventures is maintaining a
firewall between their values and those of television.
</P>
<P>
   So far, so good. But if the money starts rolling in, good luck
to the newspaper folks.

   The Internet has sometimes been described as a ``lab experiment
that got loose.'' It was developed in a sheltered environment of
network researchers who knew and trusted each other. But after it
escaped from the laboratory in 1995, it found itself in a hostile
environment full of unsavory characters.
</P>
<P>
   Recent security incidents like the ``ILOVEYOU'' virus and the
attacks on major Web sites a few months ago have shown how
vulnerable the Internet really is.
</P>
<P>
   Modern cryptography is often hailed as the magic elixar that
will make cyberspace safe for commerce. But it will only work if
people use crypto security features effectively.
</P>
<P>
   Security researchers have tended to focus on the hard issues of
cryptography and system design. By contrast, the soft issues
revolving around the use of computers by ordinary people and the
creation of incentives to avoid fraud and abuse have been
relatively neglected. That needs to be rectified.
</P>
<P>
   Automatic teller machines are a good example. A lot of thought
went into the security design of these systems, and relatively
sophisticated encryption techniques were used to guard against
attacks. How effective were these designs?
</P>
<P>
   Several years ago, Ross Anderson, a security researcher at
Cambridge University, examined a number of cases of fraud at
automatic teller machines in Britain and concluded that almost all
of the incidents involved human error. The encryption technology
was fine; the security problems occurred because the systems were
misinstalled, misconfigured, and mismanaged by the local banks. The
paper, ``Why Cryptosystems Fail'' can be found at
http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/(tilde)rja14/.
</P>
<P>
   Why were the local banks so sloppy? The answer lies in the way
liability is assigned in Britain. In the United States, if there is
a dispute between a customer and a bank, the customer is right
unless the bank can show that he is wrong. In Britain, the burden
of proof is reversed: the bank is right unless the customer can
show it is wrong. Since it is almost impossible for a customer to
prove the bank made a mistake, British banks had little incentive
to take care. The resulting sloppiness led to a rash of ATM fraud.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, banks have an incentive to invest in risk
management techniques. Banks in areas prone to ATM fraud, for
example, have installed cameras and trained their staff in security
practices. So, even though American banks spend less on security
than do British banks, Anderson concluded, they take aim at it more
effectively. This example illustrates one of the fundamental
principles of the economic analysis of liability: It should be
assigned to the party that can do the best job of managing risk.
For most risks associated with ATMs, the banks are in better
position to manage risks than are the users, so they should end up
with most of the liability. But you wouldn't want the users to
escape all liability for their actions, since they would then tend
to be too sloppy. The right balance should depend on the influence
that each party has over the possible risk factors.
</P>
<P>
   Which brings us back to computer attacks. One of the reasons
that computer security is so poor in practice is that the liability
is so diffuse. Consider the attacks that took place a few months
ago, in which computer vandals took over computers on relatively
unprotected university networks and used them to shut down Yahoo
and other major Web sites. Although the universities found the
takeover of their machines a nuisance, they didn't bear the bulk of
the costs of the attack on Yahoo. But if universities bore some
liability for the damages to third parties, they would have a
stronger incentive to make their networks more secure.
</P>
<P>
   The same problem arises with providing high-speed broadband
service to the home. These networks are, by default, always
connected to the Internet, leaving them susceptible to being used
to mount an attack in cyberspace. If a particular user's computer
is taken over, should he have liability for the cost of the attack
on someone else? The average user is essentially clueless about how
to prevent his computer from being taken over, so assigning
liability to him would be pointless.
</P>
<P>
   Assigning liability to the network operator would make more
sense.
</P>
<P>
   A typical security analysis involves identifying weak points in
a system and indicating who might be in a position to fix them. But
security analysts should go one step further and examine the
incentives of those responsible for the system. Such an analysis
could be used to assign liability so that those who are best
positioned to control the risks have appropriate incentives to do
so.
</P>
<P>
   Once the liability assignment is straightened out, the parties
stuck with the liability will no doubt want to buy insurance. At
first glance, it appears that this is counterproductive: If you are
perfectly insured against liability, why should you invest in risk
management? But this ignores the incentives of the insurers: They
only want to insure clients who use good security practices, giving
them every incentive to instruct their clients in how to improve
their Internet security.
</P>
<P>
   Just as an insurer of an office building will give you a reduced
rate if you have sprinklers every 12 feet, an insurer against
computer crime will give you a reduced rate if you install security
patches within two weeks of their posting, provide continuing
education for security staff and engage in other good risk
management practices.
</P>
<P>
   This is how it should work, but we are not there yet. Most
insurance companies have very little experience with computer
security, and being unable to judge the risks, they offer little in
the way of protection. As their experience increases, they will be
better placed to offer advice to their clients. And when insurance
companies do start insuring against computer attacks, the companies
will have a great incentive to do it right: If they give bad
advice, they will have to pay the resulting insurance claims.
</P>
<P>
   So, what should be done about computer crimes? The first step is
to assign legal liability to the parties best able to manage the
risk. Insurers can then develop expertise in risk management for
computer security and provide such services to their clients.
Unfortunately, this will be a long and slow process. In the
meantime, we can expect to see many more disruptions on the
Internet.

CNN LIKE 24-HOUR RECORD STORE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL GOODYKOONTZ  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED - CNN is like a 24-hour record store: You don't require
its services all the time, but it's nice to know it's there if you
need it.
</P>
<P>
   The network George Bush watched during the Persian Gulf War
celebrates 20 years today - 20 years of all news, all the time -
even when there's no news to report.
</P>
<P>
   We've talked before about the kinds of problems this presents.
When other networks, such as MSNBC and Fox News, jumped into the
24-hour fray, competition somehow bred idiocy - turning the Elian
Gonzales story into a Huge Event, for instance, fueling the
frustrations both sides felt until a firecracker became a powder
keg.
</P>
<P>
   Yet when gun-toting feds finally burst into the home where Elian
was staying, it sure was nice to have the 24-hour guys around so we
could see what was happening. So, like anything else, 24-hour news
is a trade-off; the best you can hope for is that the good
outweighs the bad. And with CNN, it usually does.
</P>
<P>
   When the space shuttle Challenger exploded, we were glued to the
set. When Bernard Shaw, John Holliman and Peter Arnett crawled
underneath a table in Baghdad and kept reporting as the city was
being bombed, people of my generation got a taste of what hearing
World War II radio broadcasts was like.
</P>
<P>
   On the downside, CNN has given us ``Larry King Live'' and
``Crossfire,'' a big honkin' loogie in the eye of the traditional
interview show and news-talk roundtable, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   But with local TV news being nothing more than a police lineup
broken up with the occasional weather gimmick, it's good to have an
option when national news breaks.
</P>
<P>
   And when there's nothing going on? That's why ``MASH'' reruns
exist.
</P>
<P>
   VH1 has scheduled a movie each Wednesday night through Sept. 6,
including five original films, the first of which, ``It's Only Rock
and'' ``Roll,'' aired Wednesday. The rest: ``Daydream Believers:
The Monkees'' ``Story,'' on June 28 and repeating Aug. 2; ``Out of
Sync,'' on July 12; ``Meatloaf: Bat Out of Hell'' on July 26; and
``At Any Cost,'' on Aug. 9.
</P>
<P>
   Great, I guess. But between this and MTV's insipid programming,
where does a guy got to go to see a music video these days?

CONVERSION TO THE DOLLAR DIVIDES ECUADORANS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD CHACON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   QUITO, Ecuador _ Mauro Vallejo fumbled with his socks and pulled
out two thick, wrinkled wads of sucres, his country's currency.
Then, he reached into his shirt pocket and quickly produced a thin
roll of crisp US dollars.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dollars are easier to handle,'' said Vallejo, a 24-year-old
currency vendor, who did brisk business selling greenbacks to
passing motorists despite a steady drizzle. ``I don't have to keep
every pocket full of sucres anymore. But I feel a little lighter,
and a little poorer.''
</P>
<P>
   This small Andean country is in the midst of a radical, closely
watched experiment _ converting its currency to dollars. The move
has many of its 12 million citizens filled with hope, nostalgia,
dread, and doubt.
</P>
<P>
   In an attempt to stabilize an economy that has been battered by
60 percent inflation and triple-digit devaluation over two years,
Ecuador has officially adopted the dollar as its main currency.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters argue that making the dollar king will help rein in
inflation and will attract badly needed private investment to the
country, which is living through its worst economic crisis in more
than 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   Critics, including many of the country's vocal and restless
indigenous groups, argue that the dollar plan is a loss of national
identity, an empty promise of better economic times, an open door
for more drug-related money-laundering, and a cover-up for years of
corrupt political behavior.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is not about our currency,'' said Josefina
Andrade, a 31-year-old who sells indigenous crafts in El Ejido Park
in central Quito, the capital. ``It's about politicians and their
friends in the banks who have betrayed our people.''
</P>
<P>
   On Jan. 9, the president at the time, Jamil Mahuad, announced
the decision to convert to a dollar-based economy. The idea it drew
thousands of angry indigenous residents to the capital.
</P>
<P>
   With encouragement from military leaders, the protesters stormed
the congressional and presidential palaces on Jan. 21, forcing
Mahuad to flee. Under pressure from US officials, who pleaded for
peace on Ecuadoran TV, military officials backed down and supported
Vice President Gustavo Noboa, another proponent of the dollar plan,
to replace Mahuad.
</P>
<P>
   The government's conversion plan fixed the exchange rate at
25,000 sucres to $1, eroding wages for most workers. As part of the
six-month dollar-transition program, however, Noboa is expected to
raise salaries for police, teachers and government workers.
</P>
<P>
   But the new president will also lift subsidies on gas,
electricity and other basic products within the next two weeks,
leaving residents bracing for higher prices and more social unrest.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tension is everywhere, and we're all waiting for what the
government will do this time,'' said the leader of one indigenous
religous group who identified himself as Jose Carlos. ``There is
still the chance that the protests will return, only next time it
might be bigger.''
</P>
<P>
   Ecuador was the latest and most dramatic example of a Latin
American country turning to the dollar for economic prosperity. In
1903, Panama replaced its paper Balboas with dollars, and reminted
its coins with US denominations.
</P>
<P>
   Argentina kept its currency, the peso, but fixed the exchange
rate at 1 to $1 in 1991 to stem inflation and devaluation. Three
years later, Cuba adopted the US dollar as the only currency that
tourists could spend, while residents continued to use Cuban pesos.
</P>
<P>
   Other countries in the region, particularly in Central America,
have debated taking similar measures, but have refused, mostly out
of nationalism and concerns about losing control over their
monetary policy. Many of them are watching Ecuador's experience.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the currency change in Ecuador said the conversion
would not be traumatic for the country. As of last year, 60 percent
of the country's bank accounts took place in dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Still, many residents said they cried in March as heaps of
50,000 sucre bills, all of them bearing the goateed image of the
national hero, Eloy Alfaro, leader of a revolution in 1895, were
dumped into a shredder at the Central Bank.
</P>
<P>
   To acquire the greenbacks, the government has been cashing in
part of its reserves and international investments and flying in
bundles of dollars under heavy security. Merchants have also begun
posting prices and accepting payments in both currencies.
</P>
<P>
   But there doesn't seem to be enough new money available yet _ at
least not in small bills. The question heard most often on Quito's
streets these days is, ``Can you make change?''
</P>
<P>
   Even those who endorse the measure warn that dollarization is
not a panacea, and that conversion won't work unless the Ecuadoran
government follows through on its pledges to privatize stagnant,
state-owned industries like telephones, petroleum and electricity
and attract revenues to pay off it's swollen $15 billion foreign
debt.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts also said that Ecuador's banks, notorious for making
bad loans to well-connected political and business figures, must be
overhauled and regulated. Some have warned that a loosely regulated
banking sector in a dollar-based economy could lead to more
money-laundering in a country nestled in the Andean drug region.
</P>
<P>
   Other experts believe that that the new currency should have
come after government and business reforms, not before them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ecuador needs to change its political culture and institutions
as a prerequisite to dollarization,'' said Jerry Haar, a Latin
America economics expert at the North-South Center at the
University of Miami. ``To do otherwise puts at risk not only a
dollarized monetary system but the very social, political and
economic foundation of the nation.''

   Editors, managing editors, wire editors:
</P>
<P>
   Beginning Sunday, and continuing for six weeks, The New York
Times will publish a series of articles, ``How Race Is Lived in
America.''
</P>
<P>
   Two generations after the end of legal discrimination, race
still ignites political debates _ over Civil War flags, for
example, or police profiling. But the wider public discussion of
race relations seems muted by a full-employment economy and by a
sense, particularly among many whites, that the times of large
social remedies is past. Race relations are being defined less by
political action than by daily experience, in schools, in sports
arenas, in pop culture and at worship, and especially in the
workplace. These encounters _ relations in the most literal,
everyday sense _ make up this series of reports.
</P>
<P>
   The series is the outcome of a yearlong effort by a team of
Times reporters to capture some of the troubling issues that
Americans continue to face and the voices of ordinary people.
</P>
<P>
   These articles, two or three each week, are long, at 6,000 words
and up. They will move on the News Service wire the day before
publication and will carry a slug of the form BC-RACE-SLUG-NYT. In
addition, the News Service will file an abridged version of each
article, approximately half the length of the original.
</P>
<P>
   Here is a brief description of the first three articles.

   RACE-CHURCH (Decatur, Ga.) _ Nearly 50 years after the Rev. Dr.
Martin Luther King Jr. scolded Christians for making 11 a.m Sunday
the most segregated hour of the week, the Assembly of God
Tabernacle here is the rarest of religious institutions: a truly
integrated church in the heart of the South. And yet, the
Tabernacle is deeply conservative, socially and theologically. What
draws its members is the intensity of their Pentacostal faith,
which teaches that the Holy Spirit can move in the lives of all
believers, regardless of background. By Kevin Sack.

   RACE-IMMIGRANTS (Miami) _ Before they left Cuba for America in
1994 Joel Ruiz, who is black, and Achmed Valdes, who is white, were
the best of friends. Today, in Miami, the two men live only four
miles apart, not even 15 minutes by car. Yet they are separated by
a far greater distance, one they say they never envisioned back in
Cuba. In ways that are obvious to the black man but far less so to
the white one, they have grown apart in the U.S. because of race.
For the first time, they inhabit a place where the color of their
skin defines the outlines of their lives _ where they live, the
friends they make, how they speak, what they wear, even what they
eat. By Mirta Ojito.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, June 7:
</P>
<P>
   RACE-MILITARY (Fort Knox, Ky.) _ On a chill December morning,
two soldiers _ one black, one white, both part of an institution
portrayed as a model of race relations _ stood only yards apart in
the middle of this sprawling base, each believing himself the
victim of racism; one because of an award, the other because of a
transfer. The Army is not supposed to harbor racial resentment
anymore. Its work force is integrated. The Army is one of the few
institutions in America in which blacks routinely boss around
whites, and supposedly no one gives it a second thought. But that
is an idealized image. The Pentagon has found that two-thirds of
its men and women had experienced a racially offensive encounter in
the previous 12 months. And those findings are more or less
mirrored here at Fort Knox. By Steven A. Holmes.

 &HT;    Brand new Life for Kaiser
 &HT;    By Earnest Reese
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ After sitting in the lead chair at courtside for more
than 1,000 games, Life University basketball coach Roger Kaiser
said Wednesday, ``It's time to step aside.''
</P>
<P>
   Kaiser, a Georgia Tech All-American, won four NAIA national
titles, including three in the last four years at Life. On
Wednesday, he announced his retirement as coach, but will remain at
the school as athletics director.
</P>
<P>
   ``I coached in the '60s, the '70s, the '80s, the '90s and in
2000,'' Kaiser said. ``I don't think I could've enjoyed anything
more, but it's time to put my energy into something else.''
</P>
<P>
   Kaiser, 62, coached 34 years, the last nine at Life, where he
started the program and led the Running Eagles to the 1997, '99 and
2000 NAIA national championships.
</P>
<P>
   Not bad for a guy from Dale, Ind., where a head count of the
town would not exceed the number of games Kaiser has coached.
</P>
<P>
   He was introduced to organized basketball in the third grade.
Former Georgia State coach Bob Reinhart was a teammate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bob and I grew up playing together,'' Kaiser said, ``and we
played on the same team in elementary school and through high
school. He would always tell me that he was wearing his arm out
passing me the ball, and I was wearing mine out shooting it. We've
been the best of friends since those childhood days.''
</P>
<P>
   Kaiser, although being recruited by Indiana, Kentucky,
Louisville, Western Kentucky and Vanderbilt, chose Georgia Tech.
</P>
<P>
   Kaiser married his high school sweetheart, Beverly Hevron, after
his junior year at Tech. On the court, he played his way to
All-America status for two seasons. Tech coach Whack Hyder
eventually said about Kaiser, ``He's the best player I ever
coached.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think our teams at Tech did a lot for basketball in the
South, especially the state of Georgia,'' said Kaiser, who also was
an outstanding baseball player. ``We beat Kentucky three times in
six games, and that was unheard of back then.''
</P>
<P>
   After playing in the old American Basketball Association for two
years after leaving Tech, Kaiser returned as the Yellow Jackets'
freshman-team coach for the 1963-64 season. He became head coach at
Decatur High School a year later and hired Reinhart as his
assistant.
</P>
<P>
   After a four-year high school record of 77-26, Kaiser headed to
West Georgia, where he posted a 20-year record of 381-186 and the
1974 NAIA national title. ``For what he's accomplished, he deserves
(retirement),'' Beverly Kaiser said. ``We started dating our
sophomore year in high school, and basketball has been our lives
ever since. But no matter what happened, Roger never brought it
home. He was the same _ win, lose or draw. If anything was eating
on him, he left it at the office.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What he did, more than anything else,'' Life forward Chummy
Johnson said, ``was instill personal pride in his players, and
pride in the team and in the school.''

JOHN COOLIDGE, SON OF PRESIDENT, DIES AT 93 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TOM LONG  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   John Coolidge, the oldest living offspring of an American
president, died Wednesday in Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center in
Lebanon, N.H. He was 93.
</P>
<P>
   By all accounts, Mr. Coolidge was as taciturn as his father,
Calvin, the former governor of Massachusetts and 30th president of
the United States, who earned the sobriquet ``Silent Cal.''
</P>
<P>
   He was an executive with the New York, New Haven, and Hartford
Railroad and president of Connecticut Manifold Forms Co., a small
manufacturer of business forms, until 1960, when he reopened a
small dairy business under the name of Plymouth Cheese Corp. in
Plymouth, Vt. The business was originally started in 1891 by his
grandfather, John C. Coolidge, and four other Plymouth farmers.
</P>
<P>
   He continued to run it well into his 80s.
</P>
<P>
   His office contained the framed first dollar he earned in his
cheese-making endeavor. Excerpts from his father's writings adorned
the walls.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wrote wonderful speeches, really agonized over them,'' Mr.
Coolidge once said. ``It's too bad that more people don't read
them.''
</P>
<P>
   It was in the old white clapboard family homestead up the road
from the factory that his father, then vice president, took the
oath of office to become president. He was vacationing there when
news of the death of President Warren G. Harding arrived.
</P>
<P>
   The oath was administered by the president's father, a notary
public, by the light of a kerosene lamp in the early morning hours
of Aug. 23, 1923.
</P>
<P>
   Young John Coolidge was taking summer military training at Fort
Devens in Ayer, Mass., when the oath was administered. The
following morning he was in line for breakfast when a captain asked
him if he'd seen the morning paper. ``When I told him no, he said,
`Your father is president of the United States,' young Mr. Coolidge
said, according to an account furnished by the Calvin Coolidge
Memorial Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Naturally, I was surprised,'' he said, ``but nothing changed.
I guess a lot of people expected me to rush off to Washington, but
I stayed and finished training. Father wouldn't have it any other
way.''
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, the only surviving son was a carbon copy of his
father. Modest and of a retiring nature, he was short on words but
long on Yankee conservatism.
</P>
<P>
   ``Father brought the national debt down from $22 billion to $17
billion. That isn't bad, is it?'' he said in a rare interview
during the 1976 presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Was his frugal father tight-fisted at home, too?
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh my, yes,'' said his son. ``He wasn't penurious or stingy,
but he knew the value of money. His father could do anything from
shoeing horses to building wagons. They believed in doing for
yourself and not spending money unless it was necessary.''
</P>
<P>
   Of President Coolidge's disdain for small talk or chit-chat, his
son said this famous story about him ``could have been'' true: A
woman sitting next to the president at dinner gushed: ``Mr.
Coolidge, I bet a friend I could get three words out of you.''
</P>
<P>
   `` You lose,'' he replied.
</P>
<P>
   The president's son was born in Northampton, Mass., on Sept. 7,
1906. His mother, Grace (Goodhue) Coolidge, was a musical,
fun-loving woman. He graduated from Amherst College in 1928.
</P>
<P>
   In his 90s, he still occasionally shuffled from his home near
the family homestead in Plymouth Notch, Vt., to collect his mail.
Often, residents reported, he was charming and outgoing; sometimes
he was not.
</P>
<P>
   According to local legend, a neighbor once confronted him about
his shifting moods: ``Some days I take after my mother,'' he said.
``Some days, I take after my father.''
</P>
<P>
   He leaves a daughter, Lydia Coolidge Sayles of Plymouth Notch,
three grandchildren, and two great-grandsons.

INSURANCE PROVIDES BUFFER TO RISING DRUG PRICES

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ More and more in recent years, private insurance
has been picking up the cost of prescription medicine. Only about
one-quarter of Americans' total drug costs are now paid out of
pocket.
</P>
<P>
   That is why there is no general political uproar even though
drug prices in the United States have been rising by as much as 15
percent a year, the drug makers are among the most profitable
businesses in the world and many new drugs in Canada and Europe
cost a small fraction of what they do here.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine the political swivet Americans would be in if that were
the case with gasoline or some other staple of daily life.
</P>
<P>
   The elderly, however, are up in arms. Those who are completely
dependent on Medicare, which does not cover the cost of outpatient
prescriptions, bear the brunt of the skyrocketing prices.
</P>
<P>
   But most Americans never face these high drug prices. They pay
no more than $5 or $10 for each prescription. The rest is covered
by their health insurance.
</P>
<P>
   ``When people don't have to pay out of pocket, it lowers the
political tension enormously,'' said Robert Blendon, a professor at
Harvard who is an expert on public opinion and health.
</P>
<P>
   Insurance coverage of prescription medicine is a relatively new
phenomenon, a consequence of the shift to health maintenance
organizations and other forms of managed care.
</P>
<P>
   Today, government figures show, 77 percent of all Americans
under 65 have health insurance, either public or private, and 99
percent of those with insurance have at least some drug coverage.
</P>
<P>
   In 1970, only 8 percent of the nation's total drug costs were
covered by private insurance. By 1980, the figure had risen to 20
percent, and by 1990, it had reached 34 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1990s the proportion rose steadily, and by last year more
than half of all spending on prescription drugs in the country was
covered by private insurance. Another 21 percent was paid with
public funds, mostly for people in the military or those covered by
Medicaid or veterans' programs.
</P>
<P>
   Put another way, the average amount of their own money that
Americans spend for prescription medicine each year has not even
kept pace with inflation in the overall economy over the last 30
years. But the nation's per capita spending on prescription drugs
has risen more than a hundredfold, to more than $300 this year from
$26 in 1970, government actuaries report.
</P>
<P>
   The Department of Health and Human Services expects the fraction
of drug costs paid out of pocket to keep dropping over the next 10
years, even if Medicare still excludes drug coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Medicaid covers the drug bills of poor people. A survey by the
Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation, which focuses on health care
issues, shows that, except for the elderly, the people who are
uninsured tend to be low-paid workers, who are not generally
influential politically.
</P>
<P>
   There may be change on the horizon. Employers who must pay
higher insurance premiums for their workers are shouldering the
burden of the rising pharmaceutical prices. Some companies have
begun to reduce their prescription drug benefits, requiring workers
to make larger co-payments or putting some expensive drugs
off-limits.
</P>
<P>
   If that trend continues and people begin taking a hit in their
wallets, the political ramifications can be substantial. But so
far, high drug prices are low on the list of Washington priorities.
</P>
<P>
   Both parties in Congress and both presidential candidates say
they want to expand Medicare coverage to include prescription
medicine. But they disagree so much on the details that action this
year is problematic.
</P>
<P>
   Bills have been introduced in Congress to hold down prescription
costs. One, for instance, would allow pharmacies to buy
American-made drugs abroad and sell them here. But bills like this
are going nowhere, at least not this year.
</P>
<P>
   There has been some movement in the states. Last month, a law
was enacted in Maine threatening the pharmaceutical industry with
price controls. The law created a commission that would negotiate
drug prices for uninsured Maine residents and could impose price
limits, starting in 2003. Similar measures are being considered in
a few other states. But in most instances, this seems to be a case
of politicians seizing an issue and drumming up support rather than
responding to demands from their constituents.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   An analysis by the Kaiser foundation found that in 1997, the
last year for which data is available, private insurance plans
required beneficiaries to pay on average a $5.53 co-payment for
each generic drug prescription and $9.96 for a brand name drug. The
average retail price, the analysis showed, was $30.76. For drugs
taken on a regular basis, a prescription is normally for a 90-day
supply.
</P>
<P>
   Employers are paying the tab. At Ford Motor Co., for example,
Dr. Woodrow A. Myers Jr., the director of health care management,
calculated that the company's pharmaceutical bill would increase by
nearly 25 percent this year alone, to $470 million from $380
million in 1999. The company, he said, paid nearly as much for
drugs as for workers' hospitalization.
</P>
<P>
   Ford employees never feel the pinch. Hourly workers pay $5 for
each prescription. Salaried workers pay $12 for brand name drugs
and $2 for generic drugs. Retirees get the same benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Myers said 24 percent of Ford's health care premiums go to
drugs. That percentage seems to be typical of large companies. The
money is withheld from paychecks, and most workers never think
about it.
</P>
<P>
   One of the anomalies created by most people's insulation from
rising pharmaceutical prices was that Americans tended to insist on
the newest medicine on the market _ the drugs that cost the most.
For example, Myers said Ford workers often demand that their
doctors prescribe Prilosec, a new, heavily advertised ulcer drug
that costs $3.80 a day. In many cases, said Myers, a physician, the
workers had nothing but a routine case of heartburn that would
respond just as well to older, generic medicine that would cost a
few cents a day.
</P>
<P>
   This does not seem to happen so much in other countries. In
part, that is because drug advertising aimed at the general public
is not allowed in Canada and Europe the way it is in the United
States. But it also reflects a cultural difference. A study in
1993, before pharmaceutical advertising became prominent on
television in this country, found that 66 percent of Americans were
interested in the latest medical discoveries, compared with 45
percent in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   No one disputes that these new drugs cost much more in the
United States than they do abroad. A survey last fall by USA Today
found that Prilosec, for instance, cost only $1.47 a day in Canada,
$1.67 in Britain, $1.29 in Australia and 99 cents in Mexico. The
governments in those countries negotiated the lower prices.
</P>
<P>
   The elderly who have no insurance except Medicare and other
Americans without insurance pay the prices. But it is not clear
that Americans overall pay more for drugs than people in other
countries.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The most recent extensive study, by Patricia M. Danzon, a
professor of health management at the Wharton School of the
University of Pennsylvania, concluded that Americans might not pay
more when factors were counted like the discounts received by
American drug companies, the widespread use of generic drugs in
this country and the different dosages prescribed in different
countries.
</P>
<P>
   Ernst R. Berndt, an economist at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology, said he had been unable to determine whether Americans
pay more than people elsewhere. But he noted that in the United
States in 1997, 10 percent of all health expenditures went for
drugs. The figure was 13.8 percent in Canada, 16.7 percent in
Britain and more in some other developed countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why is it,'' Berndt asked, ``if pharmaceutical prices are
highest in the U.S., their cost share is so low?''
</P>
<P>
   The pharmaceutical companies say the higher prices for new drugs
in the United States are necessary to pay for research and
development. Industry officials often note that other expenses,
like college tuition, are also higher in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   This rationale drives some academics and health policy experts
up the wall. They argue that the drug companies are making out like
bandits. But it does not seem to bother the public much.
</P>
<P>
   William D. McInturff, a pollster who has often done work for
Republican politicians and for lobbies affiliated with the
pharmaceutical industry, conducted a survey this spring in which he
tried to determine the public image of the drug companies.
</P>
<P>
   Only 28 percent of Americans with private health insurance, he
found, had an unfavorable view of the industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to minimize the pressure politicians are feeling
from the elderly who have to pay top dollar,'' McInturff said.
``But other than that vocal group, there's no great public outcry
about drug prices.''

&HT;     REGIONAL SPELLING CHAMP MISSES NATIONAL FINALS BY A LETTER

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Vicki Craig, a San Antonio eighth-grader, fell
short Wednesday of the National Spelling Bee finals by one letter.
She correctly spelled ``poltroonery'' and ``synthesis'' before
misspelling ``incarcerate'' by substituting the ``i'' with an
``e.''
</P>
<P>
   Vicki, whose participation in the bee was sponsored by the San
Antonio Express-News, said the worst part of spelling competitions
is getting a word she doesn't know.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you don't know it, you really have to listen'' to the
pronunciation and look for clues about its spelling, the
14-year-old said.
</P>
<P>
   Vicki, who attends Bradley Middle School, said she had studied
``poltroonery,'' which means cowardice. The word was taken from a
list given to the contestants in advance of the competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew I had studied it,'' she said. But ``you can't let
yourself get too overconfident.''
</P>
<P>
   She didn't, calmly asking the pronouncer for the word's
definition and asking that it be used in a sentence.
</P>
<P>
   Spellers are allowed to ask for word definitions, alternate
pronunciations, the word's language of origin and how it might be
used in a sentence.
</P>
<P>
   Vicki asked the same questions for ``synthesis,'' defined as a
combination of parts in order to form a whole. After hearing the
answers, she clasped her hands together in front of her and spelled
it _ correctly.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning with the second question, the words were no longer
taken from the list. And while Vicki knew the first random word,
she was not familiar with ``incarcerate.''
</P>
<P>
   She was one of 138 spellers eliminated from the competition the
opening day. On Thursday, the remaining 110 fifth- through
eighth-grade regional champions from around the country will
compete for a top prize of $10,000 cash from the E.W. Scripps Co.,
which is sponsoring the 73rd bee.
</P>
<P>
   Vicki's mother, Susan, a bookkeeper at Walzen Elementary School
in San Antonio, said her daughter was both nervous and excited to
be in the competition. She said Vicki had been studying words with
a teacher at her junior high school before and after class.
</P>
<P>
   Vicki said she calmed herself during the bee by spelling the
words, to herself, that were asked of the other competitors. She
said that she hoped to at least make it to Thursday's round, and
she tried her best.
</P>
<P>
   Vicki won the Express-News bee in an exhausting 59-round battle.
It was her first win in four years of competing in the regional
bee. Since Vicki will enter high school next year, she will no
longer be eligible to compete.

E-MAIL'S EMERGENCE TURNS BUSH-GORE RACE INTO CYBERWAR 
</HEADLINE>
   By PETER MARKS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Gore Coverup Revealed!'' read the headline on the e-mail
message from Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The five-paragraph missive, beamed into electronic mailboxes of
reporters across the country last week, was another swipe at Vice
President Al Gore by the Republican National Committee. But it was
not a suggestion of political corruption or obstruction of justice
that had prompted the official Republican bulletin. It was a report
that Gore wore makeup.
</P>
<P>
   ``This can't be Naomi Wolf's idea of an alpha male!'' the
message quoted Jim Nicholson, the Republican national chairman, as
having joked about a recent article in People magazine that said
Gore used spray-on cosmetics.
</P>
<P>
   Hour by hour, the e-mail arrives like digital daggers from the
candidates and their parties. Catty, pithy, weighty, gossipy, the
messages materialize via the open cyberfaucet of the 2000 campaign.
``Bush's Million Mom Manipulation,'' began a message from the
Democrats. ``Democrat Fat Cat Discriminates Against Those Who Flee
Castro's Clutches,'' read one from the Republicans. ``New York
Honor Guard Spat On at Clinton Nomination,'' read another.
</P>
<P>
   Only by extension is the target of the computer missives the
American voter. The more immediate audience is the American
journalist. ``Day 52: Reporters Held Hostage!'' screamed the
headline of e-mail from the Republican National Committee in April.
One of a series of such messages from the committee, it was
intended to remind the press that the vice president had not held a
news conference in 52 days. Under an illustration of political
writers from Newsweek and The Washington Post in the stocks, it
implored, ``Mr. Gore, please let these reporters go!''
</P>
<P>
   Campaigns, of course, have always whispered nasty little
nothings about the opposition into reporters' ears. But just as
e-mail has ushered in a new era of epistolary ease and
connectedness for the world at large, it has also created a
hyper-efficient form of press release, a paperless document that
not only links the political world to the nation's assignment
editors, columnists and news anchors in seconds, but also allows
the campaigns to fire at each other at will, all day long.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, a presidential campaign is no longer so much a
series of stops as an endless wave. Gaze at the laptop screen of
any political reporter on the road these days and see how rapidly
campaign e-mail accumulates: the Message of the Day has given way
to the Message of the Last 10 Minutes. And, not surprisingly, in
the proliferation of messages comes all manner of information:
useful, irrelevant or irreverent.
</P>
<P>
   Nicholson's alpha-male crack, for instance, made it onto the
Perspectives page of the current issue of Newsweek, and the
``reporters held hostage'' messages were noted by several
newspapers and television commentators in April. (Late that month,
after the count had passed 60 days, Gore held a news conference.)
</P>
<P>
   The ability to express so much is transforming campaign
back-and-forth into a kind of online bile duct.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything keeps speeding up, and becoming less profound in
the process,'' said Howard Fineman, a political analyst for
Newsweek and MSNBC.
</P>
<P>
   Like many reporters, Fineman is ambivalent about all this
e-mail, perplexed by the tone and the volume but anxious about the
consequences of not receiving it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have several e-mail addresses,'' he said, ``and I just keep
establishing new ones to get away from the old ones. And maybe once
a week, I manfully press the `control-A' combination, which
highlights all of the e-mail, and then I hit the delete button.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course,'' he added, ``in the spirit of confession, I have
to say that when I found that I wasn't on the latest version of the
Gore campaign's e-mail list, I called them up and gave them a piece
of my mind.''
</P>
<P>
   Any political operation of any importance today is online with a
vengeance, and e-mail has become the baseline conveyance that the
telephone and the fax machine once were. (Mention old-fashioned,
Postal Service-type mail to campaign press secretaries, and they
burst into laughter.)
</P>
<P>
   The message via computer is equal parts invasive and discreet.
``Right now, people take it more like a phone call than a press
release,'' observed Clifford D. May, director of communications for
the Republican National Committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``The difference is, it's a phone call that's not in real
time,'' he added. ``So I may e-mail to financial columnists that Al
Gore says he owns no stocks whatsoever: `Either he's not telling
the truth or he's a financial dolt. Don't you think you should
write about it?'''
</P>
<P>
   The advantage? ``You're not interrupting someone on deadline. I
suppose you could do that on a voice mail, but on e-mail you can
take your time to compose the message, to make it as persuasive as
you possibly can.''
</P>
<P>
   Reporters are by training disposed to discount the persuasion of
the press release. But the campaigns and their allies insist that
e-mail has made it easier to get their story into print or on the
air faster. Jennifer Backus, press secretary for the Democratic
National Committee, said that as the first round of news-agency
accounts was transmitted during Republican presidential debates in
the primary season, her staff would immediately respond to those
accounts by sending e-mail to the writers _ and could see the
results as quickly as the next cycle of reports that evening. By
then, she said, the reports were reflecting the Democrats' own
assessment of the Republican debate.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   And in the game of rapid response _ getting your message out
before your opponent's can make an impact _ e-mail delivered with
surgical precision can pre-emptively alter the flow of a major
story.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was funny,'' said Craig Crawford, editor in chief of the
online political digest Hotline. ``My e-mail sound file is from
`2001: A Space Odyssey,' and early one morning HAL goes, `You have
received a message.' It was Al Gore's people with a response to the
Social Security plan that Bush put out.''
</P>
<P>
   The oddity was that the message arrived before Gov. George W.
Bush held the news conference where he formally unveiled his
proposal to partly privatize Social Security. ``Before the sun was
up, I had Bush's plan and Gore's response,'' Crawford said.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Lehane, press secretary for the Gore campaign, says the
strategy, which he calls ``pre-buttal'' _ had the desired effect;
the degree to which major newspapers reflected Gore's objections
surprised even Lehane. Normally, he said, as much as 90 percent of
the content might be devoted to the candidate making the proposal.
With the rapid response, he said, ``my sense is you get 60-40
play.''
</P>
<P>
   There is a rollicking tabloid gusto in the tone of campaign
e-mail, whether the Bush campaign is reinforcing the idea that Gore
stretches the truth (in its continuing series ``The Gore
Detector'') or the Gore campaign is hammering away at Bush's record
in Texas (``one of the dirtiest states in the nation'').
</P>
<P>
   In a message posted last Friday, the Democratic National
Committee renewed its daily efforts to get under Bush's skin with
the suggestion that his campaign was trying to conceal a deeply
conservative agenda. ``Today marks eight days that George W. Bush
has refused to release a tape copy or a transcript of remarks he
made to a far-right conservative organization last October,'' the
message said.
</P>
<P>
   It arrived minutes before a Bush campaign bulletin intimating
that Gore was not telling voters the truth about his Social
Security plans, that he would either raise taxes or cut retirement
benefits. Earlier in the day, the Gore campaign went online to say
Bush had spoken to the Catholic Press Association ``without
mentioning his very public embrace of anti-Catholic Bob Jones
University during the Republican primary.'' Which came on the heels
of Bush e-mail that summed up the week's events as ``Bush Leads,
Gore Flounders.''
</P>
<P>
   Not only can e-mail circulate instantly, its recipients can
forward it instantly: the virtual equivalent of stuffing fliers
under thousands of windshields simultaneously. Campaign spokesmen
say this can make the technology a useful way to talk to their rank
and file as well as to reporters.
</P>
<P>
   The parties and the campaigns maintain that so far, e-mail to
those supporters has been used as a means of circulating favorable
news articles and marshaling the troops rather than as a tactical
weapon against an opponent. ``When Gore was going to a specific
part of the country,'' Lehane said, ``we used e-mail to recruit
volunteers to go.''
</P>
<P>
   It can also be just plain fun. Along with posting presidential
candidate schedules (``The vice president remains overnight in
Memphis'') and innocuous news tidbits (``Wisconsin Veterans Back
Bush''), the campaigns engage in an endless cyberspace version of
trash talk.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic National Committee, in installments of a feature
called ``Bush Lite,'' makes merciless sport of Bush's semantic
gaffes and failures to communicate. ``Bush Confused Canadian Prime
Minister With Canadian Cheese Curd Snack Treat,'' read an item that
the Democrats posted on April 24.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican National Committee replies with a daily watch of
Gore's lack of formal endorsement by former Sen. Bill Bradley.
``Missing,'' says the mock-up of a milk carton with the likeness of
Bradley and the words ``Got endorsement?'' emblazoned on the side.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sophomoric humor is a huge piece of this,'' Lehane said.
``It's got to go so over the top that people pay attention.''
</P>
<P>
   Short attention spans are, after all, another hallmark of the
age of instant media gratification, an age when the saddest fate to
befall a short and punchy computer message is that it be ignored. A
fate that is alas inevitable for some electronic mail when messages
are arriving in batches faster than you can say ``download.''
</P>
<P>
   As May, the Republican spokesman, himself acknowledged, ``I have
188 unread e-mails in my queue at the moment.''

MICROSOFT FILES TECHNICAL CRITIQUE OF GOVERNMENT BREAKUP PLAN 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOEL BRINKLEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Ignoring the judge's assertion that he wanted no
more briefs, Microsoft filed a detailed criticism of the
government's breakup plan Wednesday, the last filing for the record
before the judge rules on how to deal with the company's antitrust
violations.
</P>
<P>
   The company's proposal significantly modifies nearly every
element of the government's remedy plan, lengthening the amount of
time the company would have to comply with the order and scaling
back many proposals.
</P>
<P>
   The government proposal ``is defective in numerous respects,
making the document vague and ambiguous'' and therefore ``void and
unenforceable,'' the company's brief said.
</P>
<P>
   An earlier brief, filed on May 10, laid out Microsoft's broad
objections to the remedy proposal. This one is a technical
critique, attacking individual points in the plan, including e-mail
retention rules, joint-venture restrictions and a requirement that
Microsoft's senior managers be required, within 90 days, to certify
that they have read and understood the remedy ruling.
</P>
<P>
   Reacting to the Microsoft filing Wednesday evening, the Justice
Department said: ``This is another effort to posture for appeal.
The filing does not come to grips with the fact that Microsoft has
been found to have repeatedly engaged in serious legal violations,
and serious remedies are required.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft says it intends to appeal as soon as Judge Thomas
Penfield Jackson rules on the remedy, a ruling that is expected
Thursday or Friday. The judge has already suggested that he is
inclined to accept the government's recommendation that the company
be broken up.
</P>
<P>
   Included in the Microsoft filing was a justification for the
company's decision to place a long document called an ``offer of
proof'' in the record during a court hearing on May 24, just before
the judge ended the proceedings. The document included statements
from witnesses that the company would have called or quoted, had
the judge held on a hearing on remedies, as Microsoft requested.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department, also ignoring the judge's no-more-briefs
edict, argued in a brief filed last Friday that the offer-of-proof
filing was cynical and irresponsible. On Wednesday Microsoft called
the government's accusations baseless and submitted an additional
offer of proof.
</P>
<P>
   The latest offer includes statements from seven academic experts
and corporate leaders who say they oppose the government's breakup
plan and related remedy proposals. Among them are Michael Capellas,
the chief executive of Compaq Computer; Jeffrey Katzenberg, founder
of the DreamWorks motion picture studio; Tom Nicely, chairman of
Geico, the insurance company; and John Whitacre, chief executive of
Nordstrom Inc., the department store chain based in Seattle,
Microsoft's hometown.
</P>
<P>
   Among Capellas' complaints is the general concern that Microsoft
would not be allowed to accord Compaq special treatment in pricing
and partnerships.
</P>
<P>
   ``Compaq is several times the size of the 20th largest''
manufacturer, he wrote, and ``there is no reason why Compaq should
not receive more resources from Microsoft, given our greater
investment in testing, distributing and promoting Microsoft's
technology.''
</P>
<P>
   Katzenberg wrote: ``If Microsoft were broken up _ as the
government proposes _ Microsoft's operating systems, applications
and other products over time would become less and less compatible,
both with each other and with the various hardware products used by
DreamWorks.''
</P>
<P>
   Before it critiqued the government's remedy proposal, Microsoft
stressed once again that ``the relief requested by the government
is extreme and unjustified.'' But while the company objected to the
proposal in its entirety, it also picked apart nearly all of its
parts, beginning with the first paragraph.
</P>
<P>
   There, the government gave Microsoft four months after the
judge's ruling to submit a plan for breaking the company into two
parts (though the actual breakup would be stayed until legal
appeals are complete). Microsoft countered by lengthening the time
to 12 months.
</P>
<P>
   The company notes that numerous federal agencies and foreign
governments, in places where Microsoft has subsidiaries, would have
to approve the breakup plan, and ``obtaining such approvals would
be a time consuming process.''
</P>
<P>
   The government plan would create two new companies; one would
hold the Windows operating systems, the other everything else,
including the Office suite of programs like Word for word
processing and Excel for spreadsheet calculations.
</P>
<P>
   Under the plan, the applications company would have rights to
Internet Explorer, the company's Web browser, and could license it
back to the operating system company. But in Wednesday's brief,
Microsoft makes the same argument it has put forward since 1997,
that there is no such thing as a Web browser; Internet Explorer is
merely a feature in Windows. Jackson forcefully rejected that
argument in his rulings.
</P>
<P>
   Along with the breakup plan, the government has proposed a long
list of rules that would modify Microsoft's conduct. The company
picked those apart, too. For one, it deleted a provision
prohibiting Microsoft from making special marketing deals with
computer makers _ the provision Capellas of Microsoft also opposed.
During the trial, the government showed that Microsoft sometimes
used the special deals to reward companies that followed
Microsoft's lead on issues of importance to the company.
</P>
<P>
   Among other changes, the company proposed to charge other
companies ``a reasonable royalty'' for access to technical data
about Windows needed to design programs that run with the operating
system.
</P>
<P>
   The company also deleted a requirement that it retain all of the
e-mail written by senior company managers for four years, calling
the proposal ``overly broad and unduly burdensome.'' It was e-mail
from company managers, including Bill Gates, the chairman, that
formed the basis for the government's successful suit against
Microsoft.

WORLD BANK CITES ITSELF IN STUDY OF AFRICA'S BLEAK PERFORMANCE
</HEADLINE>
  By JOSEPH KAHN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Devastated by war, corruption and disease, people
in sub-Saharan Africa live less well today than they did in the
1960s, and aid donors have to share the blame, the World Bank said
in a comprehensive study issued Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The report, prepared jointly with the United Nations and African
development institutions, said Ghana, Mozambique and Uganda were
among a handful of African nations that have piloted a way out of
extreme poverty. But it says that with AIDS, malaria and civil
strife rising, conditions in the region as a whole are worsening.
</P>
<P>
   The World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, the two
leading international lending agencies, have come under intense
scrutiny over their multibillion-dollar African aid programs.
Protesters who ran noisy demonstrations in Washington at the spring
meetings of the bank and the fund said the two institutions had
made Africa poorer through failed policies, a position that the
bank's analysis partly vindicates.
</P>
<P>
   The 280-page report acknowledges that the heavy flow of aid in
recent decades did relatively little to ignite sustained economic
growth, but the study adds that the World Bank has reinvented how
it manages aid.
</P>
<P>
   ``The temptation is to retreat into pessimism,'' the bank's vice
president for Africa, Callisto Madavo, said. ``But I think if you
look at what we have been doing recently, you can see that we're
really on the right track.''
</P>
<P>
   Sub-Saharan Africa is the only major region that moved backward
in the later decades of 20th century, says the report, which
catalogs the many woes while prescribing some remedies.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1960s, African nations were widely considered more
advanced than East Asian nations. But between that time and the end
of the '90s, Africa retreated in real economic terms, while East
Asian economic output increased fourfold.
</P>
<P>
   Today, sub-Saharan Africa's 48 nations have collective economic
output that does not much surpass that of Belgium. Poland alone has
more roads. Africa's share of world trade has steadily declined to
less than 2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Africa depends more on foreign aid today than ever, the report
says. Loans and grants from rich nations account for 10 percent of
total economic activity, and a heavy debt burden constrains the
ability of governments to put their fiscal houses in order.
</P>
<P>
   Infectious diseases like malaria and AIDS take more of a toll
now than at any time since the early part of the 20th century.
Africa accounts for 70 percent of the AIDS cases reported around
the world. Even if progress against the disease is made, experts
expect the disease to reduce the average African life expectancy by
20 years, erasing all the gains since World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Endemic corruption and war, including the conflicts in Ethiopia
as well as western and central Africa, are the main causes of the
bleak performance, the report says. But the World Bank accepts some
blame.
</P>
<P>
   The report says the bank and its sister agencies have wasted
billions on ill-conceived projects. Even when projects were
carefully managed, they sometimes competed with national
governments, drawing talented bureaucrats and leaving nations
``project rich and cash poor,'' it says.
</P>
<P>
   The bank calls on rich countries to open their markets to
imports of African goods. Wealthy nations collectively spend $300
billion to subsidize and protect their own farmers against foreign
competition, the report says, a figure that is as large Africa's
total economic output.

A BEAUTY, LITERALLY AND SPIRITUALLY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROBERT PHILPOT 
C.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's unlikely that every movie made in Iran is exquisitely
beautiful. But the ones successful enough to merit being imported
to America _ such as 1996's ``Gabbeh'' and 1997's ``Children of
Heaven'' _ are uniformly stunning, fablelike tales told with an
artist's appreciation of color and an almost unearthly knack for
heightening sensory awareness.
</P>
<P>
   The most extraordinary of these may be ``The Color of
Paradise,'' which was written and directed by Majid Majidi, who
also handled ``Children of Heaven.'' Like that movie, ``Paradise''
is about the passion and heart of a child, in this case 8-year-old
Mohammad. Mohsen Ramezani, a nonprofessional actor, doesn't play
the role of Mohammad so much as he inhabits it.
</P>
<P>
   Like Ramezani, Mohammad is blind, and Majidi frequently rests
the camera on him in wordless scenes where he takes in the sounds
around him, which are dominated by the chirps of birds and the
tok-tok-toks of woodpeckers that seem to be trying to tell Mohammad
something. In a captivating sequence early in the film, Mohammad
rescues a baby bird that has fallen from its nest, and Majidi
communicates the tactile joy in this: the feel of the frail
nestling, the roughness of the tree bark, the texture of an egg,
the quizzical nips of the mother bird. It's indicative of the way
Mohammad embraces life, and yet he remains frustrated by his
inability to see any of it, a cruelty that Majidi and
cinematographer Mohammad Davoodi _ whose compositions often
resemble paintings _ emphasize by making everything surrounding the
boy as jaw-droppingly gorgeous as possible.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to Mohammad is Hashem, the boy's morose,
self-pitying father, a widower played by Hossein Mahjub with the
wounded look of a whipped dog. Hashem loves Mohammad, but considers
him a burden, and is continually trying to pawn him off _ on the
teachers at Mohammad's special school, on the boy's loving and
majestic Granny (Salime Feizi), on a blind carpenter (Morteza
Fatemi) who the father hopes will teach the boy a trade and make
him self-sufficient. The only thing that makes Hashem smile _ and
when he does, you think his face will shatter _ is the prospect of
marriage to a neighbor woman, but Mohammad is an obstacle to that,
as well.
</P>
<P>
   The story is deceptively simple and unabashedly sentimental,
with tears flowing so liberally in spots that ``wailing and
gnashing of teeth'' is a near-literal description. But Majidi
steers clear of blatant manipulation, preferring to seduce with the
beauty of his images: lush forests, imposing mountains, fields of
flowers, sharply hued petals turning into dyes, eerily foggy
valleys, rushing rapids, the smiling faces of Mohammad's cheerful
young sisters, the iconically lined face of his wise but saddened
grandmother.
</P>
<P>
   Some might find the ending, which resolves the movie's quest for
faith, too ambiguous. But if anything, it's too literal, a slip in
subtlety from a movie that works on us from the inside. It's so
thick with beauty that the subtitles hardly seem necessary; Majidi
tells a story with pictures, and their power is enthralling. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Color of Paradise,'' in Farsi with English subtitles, is rated
PG for mild violence and adult themes. &QL;

&HT;     ALISON MILLER MOVES INTO SPELLING BEE FINALS 
</HEADLINE>

 &HT;     By AUSTIN ZALKIN  
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Alison Miller, 14, a home-schooled student from
Niskayuna, N.Y., correctly spelled three words _ saprophagous,
vendetta and carafe _ at the 73rd National Spelling Bee Wednesday
to advance to Thursday's final round.
</P>
<P>
   Alison, who competed in the bee here two years ago but did not
make the finals, said in an interview, ``I enjoy it when I get the
words right.''
</P>
<P>
   She called saprophagous a ``memorable'' word. ``It means feeding
on dead bodies. So it's pretty hard to forget.''
</P>
<P>
   Alison, who was sponsored by the Albany Times Union, joined 247
other students from around the country at the start of the 73rd bee
and was one of 110 finalists. The bee is administered by the E.W.
Scripps Company.
</P>
<P>
   Alison knew the word vendetta from reading widely, said her
father, Ross Miller, a corporate risk manager.
</P>
<P>
   A vendetta is a feud in which a wronged person seeks vengeance.
</P>
<P>
   Alison quickly spelled carafe after asking for its definition
and being told that it is a ``bottle usually made of glass.''
</P>
<P>
   Alison said she has studied languages such as French, Latin and
ancient Greek, which have helped her spell their English
derivatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm pretty good with words,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   While listening to other spellers, Alison held tightly to her
chair and rocked back and forth.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's sort of stressful,'' she explained. ``For me the most
nervous time is when I'm waiting. When I'm up there (answering a
question) I have something to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Ross Miller said that before coming to Washington, Alison had
spent half an hour a day on spelling.
</P>
<P>
   Last month she also competed in the Mathcounts and USA Math
Olympiad, said her mother, Mary O'Keeffe, said. Alison finished
12th in the nation in Mathcounts and was among the top 30 in the
Olympiad, where she was one of a few eighth-graders in the
high-school-level competition. In March she won the regional
spelling bee sponsored by the Albany Times Union.
</P>
<P>
   O'Keeffe, who volunteers as a mentor in local public schools,
said she was a school spelling champion herself as an eighth grader
and that she is a descendant of Noah Webster, the famous compiler
of dictionaries.
</P>
<P>
   O'Keefe, who called Alison a ``very independent learner,'' said
she took up spelling in the sixth grade and right away made it to
the national competition. She failed in the third round of the 1998
bee by spelling the word aggrandizement with an ``s'' instead of a
``z.''
</P>
<P>
   Alison, who said she wants to be a writer, will be competing
Thursday for prizes including $10,000.

TURKEY CONFRONTS REPORTS OF TORTURE 
</HEADLINE>
   By STEPHEN KINZER    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ISTANBUL, Turkey _ When a harsh report asserting that torture is
widespread in Turkey was released this week, the surprise was not
just the amount of damning evidence it contained, but also the
source.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than being prepared by a private advocacy group, the
report was the work of the parliamentary committee on human rights.
</P>
<P>
   For years, Turkish leaders have sought to play down accusations
that torture is widely practiced here. That will be harder after
what the parliamentary committee found.
</P>
<P>
   Its report contains transcripts of interviews with many
prisoners who said they had been abused. It also includes photos of
torture equipment and floor plans that show where torture cells are
supposedly located in various police stations. No report by a
government human rights body has ever been nearly this extensive or
graphic.
</P>
<P>
   Committee members and investigators interviewed more than 8,500
prisoners during a two-year period. They also conducted unannounced
visits to 50 prisons and two dozen police stations, according to
the vice chairman, Sebgetullah Seydaoglu.
</P>
<P>
   ``This committee has existed for seven years but it hasn't been
functioning properly,'' said Seydaoglu, who represents the
southeastern city of Diyarbakir, where the mostly Kurdish
population has long complained of bad treatment by police. ``In the
last year we've become very decisive about our mission.''
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, members of the committee presented a copy of their
report to the minister of justice, Hikmet Sami Turk. They met with
Turk for an hour, and afterward he said the report ``will hold up a
light for us.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Torture is a crime against humanity,'' Turk said. ``Turkey
will resolve this issue. No country can justify torture on the
grounds that other countries practice it. Claims of torture will be
followed up with resolve. Torture has never been and never will be
state policy.''
</P>
<P>
   The report says that when inmates of Istanbul's main women's
prison were interviewed, ``all recounted details of the torture and
abuse they suffered.'' Most prisoners interviewed at jails in the
eastern cities of Sanliurfa, Erzurum and Erzincan told similar
stories.
</P>
<P>
   European leaders have repeatedly told their Turkish counterparts
that Turkey must improve its human rights record if it hopes to
join the European Union. The United States State Department said in
its latest human rights report that during 1999 ``torture, beatings
and other abuses by security forces remained widespread, at times
resulting in deaths.''
</P>
<P>
   Human rights advocates are unhappy with the government's record.
The bluntness of the new parliamentary report suggests that
impatience for change is growing.
</P>
<P>
   ``This report says what we have been saying for years, that
torture is extensive and systematic in Turkey,'' said Nazmi Gur,
chairman of the Human Rights Association, which has often been at
odds with the government. ``This could be the beginning of progress
toward meeting European legal standards.''
</P>
<P>
   Some officials have expressed fear of what might happen if the
Turkish police are forced to abandon their traditional methods.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are happy with the performance of the police,'' the
deputy interior minister, Sami Sonmez, asserted at a parliamentary
hearing last year. ``The police are capable of extracting
confessions from the culprits. What's the use of creating a lot of
fuss as long as public opinion endorses what the police do?''
</P>
<P>
   The new report recommends that local officials be held
accountable for what happens in their cities and provinces.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not, in point of fact, all that difficult to resolve
human rights issues such as abuse and torture in police stations,''
the report said. ``In order to do this, it will be enough to
determine who is directly accountable for these practices and to
single them out in the public eye.
</P>
<P>
   ``As for those who are in reality responsible for such abuses,
it is not, as people believe, the police station commanders and
other lower- or middle-level positions. Rather, it is the governors
and prosecutors who are to blame.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that they do not carry out their duties and avail
themselves of their authority should never be excused and should be
investigated as extreme neglect of duty. We should have the
political determination to resolve this issue without further
hesitation or deviation,'' the report said.

MINNESOTA'S WELFARE IS IMPROVING FAMILY LIFE, STUDY FINDS 
</HEADLINE>
  By ROBERT PEAR   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A rigorous, large-scale evaluation of changes in
welfare in Minnesota has found extremely positive effects: higher
earnings and income for parents, less poverty, an increase in
marriage rates and marital stability and improvements in children's
behavior and school performance _ a combination never seen before.
</P>
<P>
   Results of the study, issued on Wednesday by the Manpower
Demonstration Research Corp., a nonprofit, nonpartisan research
center, were hailed by conservatives and liberals alike.
</P>
<P>
   They said the study provided the first firm evidence that
changes in welfare policies could lead to increases in marriage and
marital stability, a central goal of many people who rewrote
federal and state welfare laws in the last decade.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon L. Berlin, senior vice president of Manpower
Demonstration Research Corp., said, ``The Minnesota Family
Investment Program produced substantial, far-ranging improvements
in the lives of single parents who were long-term welfare
recipients.''
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota required welfare recipients to work but allowed them
to continue receiving modest amounts of cash assistance at the same
time. Minnesota's program was more generous than those of most
other states, and more expensive, but it was also more effective in
achieving the stated goals of the federal welfare law signed by
President Clinton in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   In Minnesota, welfare workers went out of their way to emphasize
that if welfare recipients took jobs, even low-wage jobs, they
would be financially better off than if they stayed on welfare.
When a person took a job, the state would not count 38 percent of
monthly earnings in calculating the amount of cash assistance. This
policy was intended as an incentive for people to work.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Michael O'Keefe, Commissioner of Human Services
in Minnesota, said: ``One of the longstanding criticisms of the old
welfare program was that it broke up families. This new study
provides the first solid evidence that a welfare system focused on
employment can stabilize families and improve the well-being of
children.''
</P>
<P>
   The investigators said they were surprised by the size of the
changes they found in the last few years:
</P>
<P>
   _The proportion of welfare recipients with jobs rose by 35
percent, and many of the jobs provided stable full-time work. (Half
of single parents worked under the new welfare program, compared
with 37 percent under the old program.)
</P>
<P>
   _Earnings increased by 23 percent, to an average of nearly
$8,000 a year for each person who was working.
</P>
<P>
   _Average income, from earnings and welfare combined, rose 15
percent, to $10,800 a year.
</P>
<P>
   _The proportion of welfare recipients with health insurance
coverage rose to 69 percent, from 61 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``These changes led to remarkable changes in family life,'' the
report said. Domestic abuse decreased by 18 percent, marriage rates
increased by 50 percent, and parents said their children performed
better in school and had fewer behavior problems.
</P>
<P>
   The results were achieved in a robust economy, when unemployment
is low. Economists say the real test of the new programs could come
in an economic downturn.
</P>
<P>
   The results raise questions for conservatives, who have tried to
get poor people off welfare and into jobs as fast as possible. One
such question is how much extra they are willing to spend to
achieve other goals, like an increase in marriage and a reduction
in separation and divorce.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Nancy Johnson, R-Conn., said the findings vindicated the
welfare strategy of Republicans in Congress, who encouraged
marriage as one of the explicit goals of the 1996 welfare law.
</P>
<P>
   ``This study shows that if you mandate work, but couple it with
a generous approach to welfare, you can increase employment, reduce
poverty and _ most gratifying _ get more stable marriages with less
violence between partners,'' Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   Current and former Clinton administration officials were
delighted with the results.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we've seen anything quite like this before,''
said David T. Ellwood, a professor of political economy at Harvard,
who was a top welfare official in the administration from 1993 to
1995.
</P>
<P>
   Olivia A. Golden, an assistant secretary of health and human
services, said the Minnesota study was enormously important.
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota not only required welfare recipients to take jobs
quickly, as most other states have done, but spent additional money
to encourage the formation of two-parent families, Golden said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Never before have we seen such clear evidence that more
families became or stayed married,'' Golden said. ``Never before
have we seen that the rates of women experiencing domestic violence
decreased from a welfare program.''
</P>
<P>
   Lisa A. Gennetian, a co-author of the report, said, ``In
Minnesota, we found the first strong evidence that changing the
rules of the welfare system can actually increase the likelihood
that single parents get married and that two-parent families stay
together.''

U.S. AFFIRMS OAS MOVE TO ADDRESS PERU ELECTION CONCERNS 
</HEADLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER MARQUIS    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Organization of American States agreed
Wednesday to address accusations of fraud in Peru's presidential
election when foreign ministers meet in Canada this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Representatives adopted a cautious posture, refusing a
U.S.-backed move to formally convene the ministers on an emergency
basis.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department said it was satisfied with the outcome,
even though Luis Lauredo, the American ambassador to the OAS, had
to withdraw a motion to invoke a resolution that would have added
symbolic urgency to the response.
</P>
<P>
   A State Department spokesman said the plan to add Peru to the
agenda in Windsor, Canada, beginning Sunday showed ``this
registered as a serious problem with hemispheric implications.''
</P>
<P>
   The State Department had issued mixed signals this week over
whether the allegations of fraud render invalid the re-election, on
Sunday, of President Alberto Fujimori.
</P>
<P>
   Philip Reeker, a department spokesman, said Wednesday that
Peru's ``electoral process was obviously flawed,'' but refused to
repeat a colleague's charge Monday that Fujimori could not
legitimately claim another term.
</P>
<P>
   The United States is not contemplating unilateral action against
Peru, Reeker said. President Clinton, who is traveling in Europe,
has not spoken with Fujimori, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   OAS officials and diplomats predicted that hemispheric
governments will move carefully. Some noted that electoral fraud is
a different threat to democratic rule than, say, a military coup,
and some feared inciting violence in Peru.
</P>
<P>
   ``The issue of stability in Peru is playing a very strong part
and has a great weight on how they will proceed,'' said one Latin
American diplomat who was active in discussions.

<P>
   Lauredo surprised some officials by sounding a vigorous defense
of democracy, considering that American anti-narcotic officials are
deeply uneasy over the prospect of losing Fujimori as one of the
region's few reliable allies on that issue. Envoys from Canada,
Costa Rica and Argentina took stands similar to Lauredo's.
</P>
<P>
   ``The attacks on democracy today are more subtle than ever,''
Lauredo said. ``The thing that unites us is our common embrace of
democratic values and our shared responsibility to defend them when
they are threatened.''
</P>
<P>
   Peru's neighbors are especially wary of strong action, as were
Mexico and Brazil, officials said. Brazil's ambassador, Carlos
Alberto Leiti Barbosa, spoke of ``maintaining the necessary
delicate balance between the defense of democracy and respect for
sovereignty.''
</P>
<P>
   But Odeen Ishmael, the ambassador of Guyana, said that elections
in that small nation north of Brazil had been rigged for many
years, and that Guyana owed a debt of gratitude to OAS observers
who helped safeguard subsequent elections, Ishmael said.
</P>
<P>
   The diplomats received a preliminary report Wednesday from
Eduardo Stein, who monitored the elections for the OAS.
</P>
<P>
   The report detailed irregularities in Peru's system to compute
vote tallies, a lack of candidates' equal access to the mass media,
the use of public resources for political gain and improper
investigations into various complaints.
</P>
<P>
   Peru's ambassador, Beatriz Ramacciotti, accused Stein of
exceeding his mandate. He ``transformed himself into a political
actor,'' Ramacciotti said.

 &HT;    Diminishing returns: Rocker says he needs to focusBy Carroll
Rogers
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ John Rocker isn't saying his control problems stem
from any off-field pressures. He doesn't agree with Braves catcher
Javy Lopez, who has suggested Rocker is trying too hard to prove
his critics wrong.
</P>
<P>
   But Atlanta's left-handed closer does acknowledge a breakdown in
concentration.
</P>
<P>
   The problem has been obvious as Rocker struggles to find the
strike zone. Last year, when he became one of the game's dominant
closers, it rarely escaped him.
</P>
<P>
   But that was before Rocker became an object of scorn after
Sports Illustrated in December published his angry comments about
minorities, gays and foreigners.
</P>
<P>
   When asked Wednesday if the pressure is getting to him, Rocker
said: ``No, not really. I'm pitching the way I always have. It's
just a concentration thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not like I'm throwing that bad (or that different) from
the way I was throwing at the end of last year. People expect me to
pitch that way every time. If I'm not striking out two guys an
inning, everybody says something's wrong. There's nothing wrong.
It's a matter of one hitter an inning, needing to buckle down.''
</P>
<P>
   After a strong start this spring, what had become shakiness
deteriorated into all-out ineffectiveness in his last two outings.
Bobby Cox pulled him from ninth-inning, bases-loaded messes he
created Saturday in Houston and Tuesday in Chicago. Kerry
Ligtenberg rescued him Saturday with nobody out, and Mike Remlinger
came in with two outs Tuesday to get his fifth save with a
strikeout. None of the six base runners scored, so Rocker's ERA did
not change from 4.41.
</P>
<P>
   Rocker remains among the league leaders with 10 saves in 11
opportunities. After his league-imposed, half-month suspension to
start the season, he pitched two weeks without allowing a run to
score. But on May 5 at Turner Field, he blew a three-run lead to
the Phillies. Rocker has walked 12 batters in his last 6 1/3
innings, and Cox has pulled him from three games before he has
recorded an out.
</P>
<P>
   Only twice in 19 outings this year has Rocker pitched an inning
without allowing any base runners. something he did 30 times last
season Last season, 30 of his 74 outings were free of base runners,
and Rocker saved 38 games, one off the team record.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just can't finish it off,'' Rocker said. ``I don't know
what's wrong. It's not mechanical. I just don't feel like I'm
concentrating the whole inning. I'm just not making the pitches I
need to. I was one . . . pitch away from getting that game over
with.''
</P>
<P>
   Rocker's fastball still clocks in the upper 90s and his slider,
while inconsistent, was there at times Tuesday. Also, his wildness
hasn't reached the level of Mark Wohlers' of a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   For those reasons, Cox is willing to stick with him, for now,
while he works through these problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's popping the ball good, and at times his curve is good,''
Cox said. ``We've seen him great, so that's what has to remain in
our minds.''
</P>
<P>
   Rocker and pitching coach Leo Mazzone both are focusing on
finding the good in what he's doing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got hosed on a couple calls to the first hitter (in
Houston), and I tried to be careful with (Jeff) Bagwell,'' said
Rocker, who walked both, threw a wild pitch and then intentionally
walked another. ``And then Javy and I got crossed up. ... It's not
like I have control problems on every hitter. (On Tuesday,) I was
ahead of Glenallen Hill, ahead of (Julio) Zuleta.''
</P>
<P>
   Fellow Braves reliever Rudy Seanez knows about trying to control
a dominating fastball. ``He's just trying too hard,'' said Seanez,
who lost Friday night in the 10th inning in Houston. ``Everybody
tries hard, but there's a point where it's forced. Sometimes it
looks that way. I'm not in his shoes, but sometimes his
concentration might be off a little. It's easy to understand, with
everything that's gone on.''
</P>
<P>
   Mazzone said he felt good about his discussions with Rocker
after his outing in Houston, and he said he saw some results in a
more consistent release point Tuesday in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was very open-minded,'' Mazzone said. ``He talked about
concentration. He made a lot of sense. He talked to me about his
pitching, his approach. He knows what he has to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Rocker has been criticized for overthrowing his pitches, for
trying to throw them too hard or make them too perfect, but Mazzone
isn't convinced that it's a bad thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never known him when he hasn't overthrown,'' Mazzone
said. ``I don't think that's a factor in getting him straight. What
I'm concerned about is if he starts to underthrow.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Gov. George W. Bush, a staunch defender of a state
criminal justice system under fire nationally, on Wednesday
pardoned an innocent man who spent 17 years in prison and said he
will ``more than likely'' grant his first ever 30-day reprieve to a
man scheduled to be executed tonight.
</P>
<P>
   It remains unclear, however, how Bush will delay the execution
because state law precludes him from intervening unless he is in
Texas. Bush is campaigning for president outside of Texas until
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   And because Lt. Gov. Rick Perry also is out of state, Democrat
Rodney Ellis, the Senate's president pro-tem, is acting governor
and must decide whether the execution occurs. An Ellis spokesman
said Bush's wishes ``would weigh heavily'' on the senator's
decision.
</P>
<P>
   Both cases involve updated DNA testing. In the death row case,
Rickey Nolen McGinn of Brownwood says tests will show he did not
rape and kill his 12-year-old stepdaughter in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   In the other case, Bush pardoned A.B. Butler Jr. of Tyler after
DNA tests proved Butler was not involved in the 1983 abduction and
rape of a Tyler woman. Butler, sentenced to 99 years, was released
on bond in January after the DNA test cleared him and prosecutors
recommended a pardon.
</P>
<P>
   The McGinn case is the latest to invite national scrutiny of
Texas executions. McGinn could be put to death despite the trial
judge's recommendation that he is entitled to new DNA testing. The
Texas Court of Criminal Appeals on Tuesday rejected that
recommendation. The case was pending late Wednesday in the 5th U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals.
</P>
<P>
   In a Wednesday interview prior to Bush's comments, McGinn told
The Associated Press that Bush might get some political mileage out
of delaying the execution.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've heard it would hurt him. I don't know how it would hurt
him. It would show they're trying to make the judicial system
right,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush cannot reduce a death sentence without a recommendation
from the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles. The panel voted
unanimously Wednesday against that.
</P>
<P>
   The board also voted against delaying the execution, but that
does not prevent the governor from granting a single, 30-day
reprieve.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there is any doubt, any outstanding evidence that
exonerates him from the rape, we ought to look at it,'' Bush said
while campaigning in Albuquerque, N.M.
</P>
<P>
   Bush did not indicate whether he would return to Texas to grant
the reprieve. Spokesman Mike Jones said Bush had no plans to return
to the state to take action in the case.
</P>
<P>
   Ellis has served as acting governor during three previous
executions, including one Wednesday evening.
</P>
<P>
   The Houston lawmaker is a longtime critic of the Texas criminal
justice system, especially its procedures for providing attorneys
for indigent defendants. Ellis is a death penalty supporter.
</P>
<P>
   ``He makes the decision on his own, but after close and thorough
contact with staff from the governor's and lieutenant governor's
office,'' said Ellis spokesman Jeremy Warren. ``Senator Ellis takes
this very seriously and understands and will always keep in mind
the views and positions of Governor Bush and Lieutenant Governor
Perry.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who took office in 1995, has never granted a 30-day
reprieve. One hundred thirty-one Texas death row inmates have been
executed since Bush took office and throughout the presidential
campaign he has insisted all were guilty.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, he commuted Henry Lee Lucas' sentence to life in prison
after determining that questionable evidence had been used at the
trial. Lucas once said he had committed dozens of murders, but
later recanted.
</P>
<P>
   Fort Worth lawyer Richard Alley, representing McGinn, said he
will ask the trial judge to further delay the execution if 30 days
is not enough time to run the tests.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, nobody is sure'' if McGinn is guilty, said Alley.
``It can now become conclusive. If we're not sure, let's not
execute someone until we are.''
</P>
<P>
   Alley is convinced that state District Judge Steven Ellis, who
previously could only recommend the tests, will now order them.
</P>
<P>
   Brown County District Attorney Lee Haney said there is no doubt
of McGinn's guilt.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oddly enough, since DNA seems to be a big deal at this point,
it was because of DNA that the trial lasted a good while,'' the
prosecutor said. ``We had experts from three DNA labs fly in to
testify, and it stretched out the trial a little.''
</P>
<P>
   Said McGinn, ``If they're so sure, what are they afraid of?
Let's do it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Butler case ended Wednesday with a brief formal statement
from Bush's office.
</P>
<P>
   The case, according to Butler's lawyer, was Texas justice at its
worst.
</P>
<P>
   Butler was convicted in Smith County in the 1983 rape of a woman
abducted from a motel parking lot. Butler, then on probation for an
assault conviction, consistently proclaimed his innocence.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a black man accused of a brutal sexual assault on a
white woman,'' said Houston lawyer Randy Shaeffer, now representing
Butler. ``She identified him as the person who did it. He said he
didn't do it. A rural Texas jury, 999 times out of 1,000, is going
to believe the woman.''
</P>
<P>
   On Jan. 6, Smith County District Attorney Jack Skeen Jr., who
prosecuted the case in 1983, told Bush that Butler was due a pardon
because of the new DNA testing.
</P>
<P>
   Shaeffer said his client lost 17 years to a misguided judicial
system.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that this is not truly a justice system. It's a system
of politics,'' said Shaeffer. ``Most of the people in the position
of authority are watching their backsides to insure they don't do
something that would stand them in poor stead with the voters or
political opponents.''
</P>
<P>
   Shaeffer said he is uncertain as to whether Bush's current
political race played a role in the decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought the timing looked somewhat coincidental, but I'm not
one to look a gift horse in the mouth,'' said Shaeffer. ``I welcome
the governor doing right by my client any day of the week for any
reason at all.''
</P>
<P>
   In Tyler, Butler, after a day at his dirtwork job, said he
planned to celebrate with his family.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no hard feelings,'' he said. ``We went through the
proper steps and here I am.''
</P>
<P>
   Butler said his faith, not politics, prevailed in the end.
</P>
<P>
   ``I prayed and asked the Lord to reach out and touch (Bush) and
make him do the right thing.''

<P>
   BEIJING, China _ Officials have been streaming into government
bookstores in recent days and hauling away stacks of a hot new
product: a 74-page, 50-cent booklet called ``A Great Program for
Comprehensively Strengthening Party-Building.''
</P>
<P>
   This must-read item consists of two recent speeches by the man
who is the general-secretary of the Communist Party chief and the
president of China, Jiang Zemin, and a collection of editorials
describing the ``brilliant thesis'' and ``essential compass'' that
Jiang has laid out _ a purported breakthrough in Communist doctrine
labeled the ``Three Represents.''
</P>
<P>
   To prosper in a new century, Jiang says in these speeches, the
Communist Party ``must always represent the development needs of
China's advanced productive forces, must always represent the
forward direction of China's advanced culture and must always
represent the fundamental interests of China's broadest number of
people.''
</P>
<P>
   In a classic propaganda campaign that gathered full force in
May, Jiang's supposed breakthrough has been pounded home almost
daily in laudatory editorials and televised testimonials by leaders
from every province and officially recognized social group.
</P>
<P>
   If all this sounds anachronistic for a leader who is promoting a
wider opening to the West, it reflects the enduring rituals of
power within the Chinese Communist Party.
</P>
<P>
   The booklet's contents may be vague and tedious, insiders say,
but that is beside the point: Jiang is making other officials go
through the panegyrics as a show of his leadership, as a public
blow in his maneuvering to retain supreme power in the decade
ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Jiang is expected to resign as the party's general-secretary at
the 16th Communist Party Congress in 2002, when he will be 76. He
is expected to give up the presidency the year after.
</P>
<P>
   But with no strong successors in sight, Jiang, who has led the
party since 1989 and served as president since 1993, is widely
believed to want to continue pulling strings from behind the
scenes, as Deng Xiaoping did in the 1980s and 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   And so while Jiang cultivates the stature he hopes will
transcend formal retirement, officials anxious to hold on to their
own jobs loudly sing his praises.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like in ancient times, when the emperor would test his
ministers by bringing out a donkey and calling it a horse,'' said
an editor at a major party-affiliated newspaper. ``If you
maintained that it was a donkey you lost your head. If you called
it a horse, then you got a promotion.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Closely related to Jiang's effort to fortify his image, insiders
say, is his effort to secure himself a place in the Chinese
Communist pantheon, after Mao and Deng, as an important theorist.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, considering Jiang's current unrivaled
position, his ``breakthrough'' statement on the ``Three
Represents'' is garnering rave reviews and has become a staple of
high-level study sessions in provincial capitals.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``A brilliant thesis drawn from insight into the future,'' said
the party's official paper, People's Daily, on May 22 in a typical
description. ``A concentrated embodiment of the fundamental nature
of the party and the essence of socialism.''
</P>
<P>
   In other newspapers, officials have called Jiang's prosaic
statement ``pregnant with connotations and meanings,'' ``a
scientific summation of our party's nearly 80 years of historical
importance'' and ``a great program for party-building in the new
century.''
</P>
<P>
   The People's Liberation Army Daily hailed it as ``an essential
compass for military, ideological and political construction in the
new era,'' while the Federation of Trade Unions, not to be outdone,
said Jiang ``answers the question of why and how the working class
is relied on the during the process of building socialism with
Chinese characteristics.'' The China Women's News proclaimed, ``The
`Three Represents' are the criteria for women's work.''
</P>
<P>
   The campaign is, of course, low-key compared with the vicious
political winds of the Mao era, and much of the population today
can simply tune it out. At the popular Xinhua Bookstore in central
Beijing on Wednesday, most customers walked right past the rack up
front that featured the booklet on Jiang's speeches.
</P>
<P>
   But the booklet is a best seller at the Party Documents
Bookstore, where officials are buying it in bulk for their
colleagues, and ambitious party and government leaders can hardly
afford to ignore the new catch phrases.
</P>
<P>
   ``Quite apart from substance, the campaign is a test of whether
subordinates and local leaders in the provinces are staying in
step,'' the editor said. ``That's why in recent days we've seen one
local leader after another coming forward _ it's a way to affirm
their allegiance and keep their jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   This new campaign went into overdrive even before last year's
``Three Stresses'' campaign (theoretical study, political awareness
and good conduct) had fully run its course, causing complaints
about the sheer waste of time and energy.
</P>
<P>
   In that campaign, still continuing in far-flung local branches,
party and government officials have been required to spend weeks at
a time studying Deng and Jiang speeches and engaging in
self-criticism. The process was intended to spot new talent and
bring discipline to an organization seen as increasingly lax and
corrupt.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody really cares about this stuff, and people feel
disgusted when they have to study it,'' a former party propaganda
department official said of Jiang's latest ideological offerings.
``What about Taiwan or the World Trade Organization? People have
even started making off-color jokes about Jiang Zemin's love of
`threesomes.'''
</P>
<P>
   The current campaign, many believe, is just a prelude to the
probable publication this year of Jiang's collected speeches and
writings, providing a showcase for his works.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has always been the case here that the party leader is
expected to put forth his own thinking,'' the newspaper editor
said. ``Otherwise he has no prestige.''
</P>
<P>
   Party experts have noted that Jiang opened the new campaign with
speeches in the south, beginning in Guangdong province, in a
parallel with Deng's last great act, when he kicked off a new wave
of market reforms and economic growth with a celebrated southern
tour in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever his strengths as a power broker, Jiang is not regarded
as a bold theorist, and some officials are quietly grumbling about
self-aggrandizement.
</P>
<P>
   But in Jiang's defense, insiders note, he has not yet tried to
elevate himself into a Mao or Deng. Up to now, at least, he has not
granted his own ideas the official status of a body of thought, as
in Mao Tse-tung Thought, or theory, as in Deng Xiaoping Theory.

X-FILES CREATOR LOOKS FORWARD TO SEASON
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROB LOWMAN 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Chris Carter is at a crossroads.
</P>
<P>
   His hit series, ``The X-Files,'' will _ after prolonged
negotiations _ return for an eighth season in the fall, albeit with
one of its stars, David Duchovny, only coming back for half of the
shows. So now he must rethink the future of the landmark series.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm excited. I think that there are lots of interesting
stories to tell,'' says Carter. ``And in coming back, I think we've
created lots of interesting problems to solve, which is what we
like. We want the problems to solve.''
</P>
<P>
   Through the years the show's main characters _ Duchovny, who
plays Fox Mulder, the FBI agent who believes in aliens and other
assorted other-worldly phenomenon, and his skeptical partner, agent
Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) _ have had nothing but problems to
solve, starting with a conspiracy involving the possible takeover
of the planet by aliens. The show has spawned one feature film and
more may be on the way. ``X-Files'' fans are hardcore, and two
writers publish a weekly newspaper column sent around the country,
X-Cursions, dissecting each episode.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, Carter was involved the release of the first season of
``The X-Files'' on DVD, a seven-disk pack (Fox, $149.98) that
includes all 24 of the episodes. Asked if, during that first
season, he ever thought the show would be so successful, Carter
points out that television is a business where most things fail.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew it was a real good storytelling idea,'' says Carter.
``That the believer and the skeptic would create a great way to
tell science fiction stories, which for me always work best when
they come from a premise of hard science and then you apply the
what-if questions. And this was a great opportunity to do so.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly good storytelling and high production values have
helped keep the show a highly rated mainstay on the Fox network for
seven years.
</P>
<P>
   Carter says he always thought the show was told from Scully's
point of view. It was really Scully trying to keep up with Mulder,
who was always three steps ahead of her with his fantastic ideas,
he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``You really get a sense of that looking at that first year _
how characters came to where they are now.... But the first season
was Scully trying to match wits with a man who wasn't playing by
the rules.''
</P>
<P>
   Since then their relationship has evolved to where Scully is
more of a believer and Mulder is more willing to accept her
scientific rigorousness. But you wonder if the series would have
been as successful with two other actors in the roles.
</P>
<P>
   Carter says casting Duchovny and Anderson was a no-brainer for
him. ``I knew the moment I met David he was Mulder; I knew the
moment I met Gillian she was Scully. He was relatively easy to
cast, but no one saw what I saw in Gillian as Scully. One of the
reasons was that she looked much more like a street urchin. Her
hair was tousled; she didn't look like a serious person. She looked
a little Bohemian. But she had a seriousness for a young woman that
I felt would work great for the character I imagined.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of the problem, says Carter, was that the network was
concerned on how she look in a bathing suit. The irony, of course,
is that there's never been a show where Scully needed to appear in
a bathing suit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gillian's sex appeal is very sophisticated as is the
relationship between the two of them and the sexual tension,'' says
Carter.
</P>
<P>
   Last week's season finale ended with Mulder being abducted by
aliens, and Scully pregnant, presumably by Mulder and despite the
fact that she was unable to conceive. The revelation here is that
up until now Mulder and Scully had kept their relationship
platonic, and _ perhaps more than aliens or wild conspiracy _ it is
that relationship that is at the heart of the show. But now Carter
must figure out a way to do without that for half the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll bring in some new characters.'' he says. ``We have some
chances here to expand the show yet again. We're still going to
tell great stories. I want to focus more on the character of Scully
and tell stories that deal with a more mythological magic realism
approach than we have done before.''
</P>
<P>
   Carter, who began as a journalist before moving over to TV to do
Disney movies of the week, attributes the show enduring appeal to
it elasticity.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's weird.'' he says. `` `The X-Files' can expand and come
back to shape so beautifully so that you can do these wild send-up
episodes and come back and do a mythology the following week.''
</P>
<P>
   Carter doesn't think there will ever be another show like it on
television again for one reason _ ``it costs too much to do.'' And
like others, Carter laments being up against ``Who Wants to Be a
Millionaire,'' which scores big ratings numbers with relatively low
production values. ``The X-Files'' has remained a top rated show
but like others it has taken a hit.
</P>
<P>
   ``We put so much care and imagination into these stories,'' says
Carter, knowing that the show's elasticity will be tested to the
fullest next season. ``Sometimes, I think, we get lost in the
Nielsens.'' &QL;

EMINEM, KID ROCK LET THE DETROIT SIDE DOWN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVE FERMAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   For a guy raised outside Detroit, the past two weeks were
looking promising: My fellow Detroiters Eminem and Kid Rock have
become two of the hottest acts around and were releasing CDs within
a week _ Eminem last Tuesday, the Kid this Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   I'd like to report that both CDs are just fantastic, music I'll
be listening to all summer, so go plunk down your money right now.
</P>
<P>
   That, however, would be a lie.
</P>
<P>
   Eminem's ``The Marshall Mathers LP'' (all new stuff) and Kid
Rock's ``The History of Rock'' (two new songs, 12 more from earlier
records) are disappointments _ not outright terrible, by any means,
but nothing you haven't heard before, done better.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Marshall Mathers LP'' is the lesser of the two, mainly
because Eminem spends so much time defending himself in light of
the success of his first major label record, ``The Slim Shady LP,''
which established him as a rap superstar and all-around pain in the
rear end for parents.
</P>
<P>
   The beats are still tough and springy, and Eminem makes some
good points about not being a role model _ see ``Who Knew'' _ but
the shock of the new has worn off. The first CD was about his life;
this one talks all too often about the reaction to his first CD.
Add some appalling misogyny on ``Kim'' and empty-headed threats on
``Kill You,'' and you have a record that pales beside the first
one.
</P>
<P>
   ``The History of Rock'' is marginally better. Made up mostly of
songs from 1993's ``The Polyfuze Method'' and 1996's ``Early
Mornin' Stoned Pimp,'' it clearly shows that the Kid has always had
varied tastes (metal, old-school soul, gangsta rap, funk) and an
ability to fuse them.
</P>
<P>
   And there is some interesting material: ``Dark &AMP; Grey'' (a
previously unreleased demo) mixes Metallica-ish riffs with banjo
plucking, and the gangsta rap of ``Ya' Keep On'' is invigorating.
</P>
<P>
   But while the CD shows the Kid to be fairly innovative in
playing mix 'n' match with everyone from Too Short to Slayer to Ted
Nugent, it's also a clear indication that he hit a stylistic high
point with 1998's 9-million-selling ``Devil Without a Cause.''
These songs often sound like interesting experiments and
blueprints, nothing more. Just as instructive is 1990's more
rap-centric ``Grits Sandwiches for Breakfast,'' which was also
recently rereleased to capitalize on the success of ``Devil.'' The
Kid was always a nasty guy _ he's just gotten a lot better at it in
the past couple of years. &QL;

AETNA MULLS NEW ING OFFER TO BUY 2 UNITS FOR $9 BILLION
</HEADLINE>
 By MILT FREUDENHEIM   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Aetna Inc. and the ING Group, the Dutch financial services
company, said Wednesday that they were discussing a new offer from
ING to buy Aetna's financial and international divisions. Aetna
declined to discuss the price under discussion, but some Wall
Street traders estimated it could be as high as $9 billion, only
slightly less than the roughly $10 billion ING had offered for all
of Aetna earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   Aetna shares rose $5 at midday after CNBC reported the ING
offer, and closed up $4.0625 at $66.75 on the New York Stock
Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   William Donaldson, chief executive of Aetna, said his company
was ``working with ING on their new proposal concerning our
financial services and international businesses.'' He added that
Aetna was still committed to improving its Aetna U.S. Healthcare
unit, the nation's largest health insurer. ING said in a statement
that Aetna's ``domestic U.S. health care operations are not part of
these negotiations.''
</P>
<P>
   Donaldson said there were ``no assurances'' that the ING deal
would close or what the terms would be.
</P>
<P>
   And he said Aetna was still ready to split the company into two
separate health and ``wealth'' divisions and spin them to
shareholders as independent publicly traded companies as it vowed
to do when it rejected ING's $9.9 billion takeover offer in March.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street traders welcomed word of the talks, which they said
cleared the way for a bidding war over Aetna's attractive financial
services business.
</P>
<P>
   ``This opens up the situation,'' said Herbert Denton, president
of Providence Capital Inc., which has Aetna holdings. ``Aetna has
abandoned its split-up plan, and it is basically in play,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is very difficult to put the genie back in the bottle,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Securities analysts said $9 billion would be a high-end price.
</P>
<P>
   It would value Aetna's financial, pensions and overseas units at
20 times this year's projected earnings of about $470 million, said
Kenneth S. Abramowitz, a Sanford C. Bernstein analyst. He said
financial services companies had typically sold for 15 times
earnings.
</P>
<P>
   But ING has made no secret of its ambition to become one of the
biggest players in the North American insurance market. ING said
Wednesday that the talks with Aetna were consistent with its goal
of joining the top 10 companies in overall insurance in the United
States as well as expanding ``significantly'' in Latin America and
Asia.
</P>
<P>
   ING recently agreed to pay $5.1 billion for ReliaStar, a
Midwestern insurer, and assumed $1 billion of ReliaStar debt.
</P>
<P>
   Big European insurance companies are eager to buy U.S. insurance
companies because the growth potential for pensions and annuities
is much stronger than in Europe, said Arun Kumar, a bond analyst at
Chase Securities. ``There is more money being spent on retirement
in the United States,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Other European companies that have been prospecting for
acquisitions in the United States include Aegon, another
Netherlands-based insurer, AXA of France and Allianz of Germany.
</P>
<P>
   But analysts said a sale to ING could also create problems for
Aetna shareholders. Although Aetna could spinoff the financial
services and health units to shareholders without any tax
implications, a sale to ING would cause a big capital gains tax
liability for investors. Todd Richter, a Banc of America Securities
analyst, said the tax could be as high as $2 billion to $3 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to know how they will deal with the tax liability,''
Richter said. Another ``pivotal question,'' he said, ``is the value
of the health care business on a stand-alone basis.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Investors have been clamoring for asset sales that would result
in big stock buybacks that would bolster Aetna's share price. But
Abramowitz pointed out that Aetna also had $5 billion of debt. At
least some of that would probably have to be paid off as part of a
sale.
</P>
<P>
   Lee Cooperman, head of Omega Advisers, a hedge fund manager,
said Aetna would rather split up and avoid the tax liability, ``but
perhaps they have been offered a price they couldn't refuse. I'm
happy they are open-minded and flexible.''
</P>
<P>
   Aetna shares have bounced back to the mid-$60s over the last two
weeks, after sliding into the high $50's when Aetna's board
rejected the earlier offer from ING on March 12. ING then had a
plan to resell the big health unit to Wellpoint Health Networks,
based in California. Wellpoint said it knew nothing about ING's
latest overture to Aetna.

<P>
   BEIJING, China _ Officials have been streaming into government
bookstores in recent days and hauling away stacks of a hot new
product: a 74-page, 50-cent booklet called ``A Great Program for
Comprehensively Strengthening Party-Building.''
</P>
<P>
   This must-read item consists of two recent speeches by the man
who is the Communist Party chief and the president of China, Jiang
Zemin, and a collection of editorials describing the ``brilliant
thesis'' and ``essential compass'' that Jiang has laid out _ a
purported breakthrough in Communist doctrine labeled the ``Three
Represents.''
</P>
<P>
   To prosper in a new century, Jiang says in these speeches, the
Communist Party ``must always represent the development needs of
China's advanced productive forces, must always represent the
forward direction of China's advanced culture and must always
represent the fundamental interests of China's broadest number of
people.''
</P>
<P>
   In a classic propaganda campaign that gathered full force in
May, Jiang's supposed breakthrough has been pounded home almost
daily in laudatory editorials and televised testimonials by leaders
from every province and officially recognized social group.
</P>
<P>
   If this sounds anachronistic for a leader who is promoting a
wider opening to the West, it reflects enduring rituals of power
within the Chinese Communist Party.
</P>
<P>
   The booklet's contents may be vague and tedious, insiders say,
but that is beside the point: Jiang is making officials go through
the panegyrics as a show of his leadership, as a public blow in his
maneuvering to retain supreme power in the decade ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Jiang is expected to resign as the party's general-secretary at
the 16th Communist Party Congress in 2002, when he will be 76. He
is expected to give up the presidency the year after.
</P>
<P>
   But with no strong successors in sight, Jiang, who has led the
party since 1989 and served as president since 1993, is widely
believed to want to continue pulling strings from behind the
scenes, as Deng Xiaoping did in the 1980s and 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   And so while Jiang cultivates the stature he hopes will
transcend formal retirement, officials anxious to hold on to their
own jobs loudly sing his praises.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like in ancient times, when the emperor would test his
ministers by bringing out a donkey and calling it a horse,'' said
an editor at a major party-affiliated newspaper. ``If you
maintained that it was a donkey you lost your head. If you called
it a horse, then you got a promotion.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Closely related to Jiang's effort to fortify his image, insiders
say, is his effort to secure himself a place in the Chinese
Communist pantheon, after Mao and Deng, as an important theorist.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, considering Jiang's current unrivaled
position, his ``breakthrough'' statement on the ``Three
Represents'' is garnering rave reviews and has become a staple of
high-level study sessions in provincial capitals.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``A brilliant thesis drawn from insight into the future,'' said
the party's official paper, People's Daily, on May 22 in a typical
description. ``A concentrated embodiment of the fundamental nature
of the party and the essence of socialism.''
</P>
<P>
   In other newspapers, officials have called Jiang's prosaic
statement ``pregnant with connotations and meanings,'' ``a
scientific summation of our party's nearly 80 years of historical
importance'' and ``a great program for party-building in the new
century.''
</P>
<P>
   The People's Liberation Army Daily hailed it as ``an essential
compass for military, ideological and political construction in the
new era,'' while the Federation of Trade Unions, not to be outdone,
said Jiang ``answers the question of why and how the working class
is relied on the during the process of building socialism with
Chinese characteristics.'' The China Women's News proclaimed, ``The
`Three Represents' are the criteria for women's work.''
</P>
<P>
   The campaign is, of course, low-key compared with the vicious
political winds of the Mao era, and much of the population today
can simply tune it out. At the popular Xinhua Bookstore in central
Beijing on Wednesday, most customers walked right past the rack up
front that featured the booklet on Jiang's speeches.
</P>
<P>
   But the booklet is a best seller at the Party Documents
Bookstore, where officials are buying it in bulk for their
colleagues, and ambitious party and government leaders can hardly
afford to ignore the new catch phrases.
</P>
<P>
   ``Quite apart from substance, the campaign is a test of whether
subordinates and local leaders in the provinces are staying in
step,'' the editor said. ``That's why in recent days we've seen one
local leader after another coming forward _ it's a way to affirm
their allegiance and keep their jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   This new campaign went into overdrive even before last year's
``Three Stresses'' campaign (theoretical study, political awareness
and good conduct) had fully run its course, causing complaints
about the sheer waste of time and energy.
</P>
<P>
   In that campaign, still continuing in far-flung local branches,
party and government officials have been required to spend weeks at
a time studying Deng and Jiang speeches and engaging in
self-criticism. The process was intended to spot new talent and
bring discipline to an organization seen as increasingly lax and
corrupt.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody really cares about this stuff, and people feel
disgusted when they have to study it,'' a former party propaganda
department official said of Jiang's latest ideological offerings.
``What about Taiwan or the World Trade Organization? People have
even started making off-color jokes about Jiang Zemin's love of
`threesomes.'''
</P>
<P>
   The current campaign, many believe, is just a prelude to the
probable publication this year of Jiang's collected speeches and
writings, providing a showcase for his works.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has always been the case here that the party leader is
expected to put forth his own thinking,'' the newspaper editor
said. ``Otherwise he has no prestige.''
</P>
<P>
   Party experts have noted that Jiang opened the new campaign with
speeches in the south, beginning in Guangdong province, in a
parallel with Deng's last great act, when he kicked off a new wave
of market reforms and economic growth with a celebrated southern
tour in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever his strengths as a power broker, Jiang is not regarded
as a bold theorist, and some officials are quietly grumbling about
self-aggrandizement.
</P>
<P>
   But in Jiang's defense, insiders note, he has not yet tried to
elevate himself into a Mao or Deng. Up to now, at least, he has not
granted his own ideas the official status of a body of thought, as
in Mao Tse-tung Thought, or theory, as in Deng Xiaoping Theory.

EDUCATING RANDY
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Eds: Fact box below) 
By REED JOHNSON 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If some cash-strapped Midwestern university ever decides to
offer a course in ``Randy Newman 101,'' its syllabus would be
fairly straightforward.
</P>
<P>
   Chapter 1, our hero is ``born right here'' in Los Angeles,
``November '43'', as one of Newman's self-ruminative songs puts it.
</P>
<P>
   Chapter 2, he moves with his mom to New Orleans, where the hot,
sticky musical culture of the Deep South brushes up against cold,
implacable racism.
</P>
<P>
   In chapters 3 through whatever, Newman starts taking piano
lessons (at age 6), moves back to L.A., grows up, marries twice and
raises five kids.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, incidentally, he also becomes one of the most successful
singer- songwriters of the pop-rock era, cutting a distinctive
swathe through music (``Sail Away,'' ``I Love L.A.''), movies
(``Avalon,'' ``Toy Story'') and even musical theater (``Faust'').
</P>
<P>
   Randy Newman, this is your life _ or at least it's the abridged,
somewhat sanitized version that will be put forth this summer in
``The Education of Randy Newman,'' the world premiere musical play
that opens Saturday at South Coast Repertory in Costa Mesa.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is far from a literal documentation of my life, which would
have been boring beyond belief,'' Newman says one recent morning
after schlepping from his hilltop Westside home to an SCR rehearsal
room. ``It's my life, and yet it isn't.''
</P>
<P>
   That description encapsulates a project whose authors, Michael
Roth and Jerry Patch, wanted to create something with more
emotional heft and bite than the typical Broadway-style ``greatest
hits'' revue.
</P>
<P>
   Borrowing its title from ``The Education of Henry Adams,'' the
1907 autobiographical masterpiece by the renowned New England man
of letters, ``The Education of Randy Newman'' recreates the life of
a middle-aged musician who bears a striking resemblance to its
namesake _ with some details changed to protect the guilty.
</P>
<P>
   But the show also aims to tell a bigger story about postwar
America's growing pains, through the prism of Newman's radically
skeptical, mordantly humorous worldview.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given that Randy writes about the world and the people he sees
in it and how he feels in it, we decided to write the story of a
man who lived through the last half of the 20th century,'' says
Patch, SCR's resident dramaturg.
</P>
<P>
   ``And that was something that interested me because I found
myself relating to all the things this man went through,'' Patch
continues, ticking off the Civil Rights movement, the sexual
revolution, the rise and fall of the 1960s counter-culture and the
uneasy boom years of the '80s and '90s.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like going back through a photo album and seeing all of
our lives recapitulated.''
</P>
<P>
   Now a gray-haired pop elder statesman still given to Hawaiian
shirts and blue jeans, Newman says that Patch and Roth approached
him with idea of fashioning a show from his prodigious songbook
about a year ago. He'd worked with Roth previously on the La Jolla
Playhouse's 1995 world premiere of ``Faust,'' Newman's updating of
the enduring legend about a man who sells his soul to the devil.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike ``Faust,'' which was composed of all-new material,
``Education'' includes only a couple of previously unreleased tunes
from Newman's vast 300-song catalog. The rest, spanning his
30-plus-year recording career, are a mix of familiar and
less-familiar numbers sung by a cast of seven and backed by a
seven-piece band. Scott Waara, a Tony Award winner for the Broadway
revival of ``The Most Happy Fella,'' portrays the Newman character.
</P>
<P>
   For Newman, the rehearsal process has been, well, educational.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, it's been basically a good experience,'' he says.
``They (the songs) benefit by having a theatrical context
sometimes. You know, I always understand what I'm talking about,
but other people don't. And when it's clear, or it's someone with a
traditional good voice, who can hold a note, it's got a different
thing to it. And they (the songs) are easier to understand. You
know, irony in pop music, coming out of a radio, as you're driving
down the freeway.... I mean, I don't know that I get it myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Ironic self-deprecation comes naturally to Newman, as it did for
Adams. It's part of a dualistic personality capable of penning the
warm and fuzzy ``You've Got a Friend in Me'' (from ``Toy Story''),
then turning around and writing ``Life Isn't Fair,'' a trenchant
2-minute parable about tarnished ideals from Newman's 1999 studio
release ``Bad Love.''
</P>
<P>
   Newman admits that some of his purportedly autobiographical
songs like ``Dixie Flyer'' (included in the show) are partly
apocryphal, and that his songs' first-person narrators, despite
their apparent candor, are notoriously untrustworthy.
</P>
<P>
   Yet he also exposes himself and his shortcomings mercilessly
through song. The Newman narrative persona may be shifty, but the
sentiments behind it tend toward the painful truth.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing about my life that I wouldn't expose to get a
song out of it,'' he asserts. ``There isn't anything more important
to me. Well, almost nothing. I wrote a love song to my first wife
on my last record, while I'm married to my second wife. Not
without, you know, some repercussions. And I'm not saying this like
`Oh, what a ruthless writer, he must be good!' I'm saying it
because it is true.''
</P>
<P>
   Newman's only other foray into musical theater besides ``Faust''
was the 1981 revue ``Maybe I'm Doing It Wrong.'' Though he has
learned to like the genre, he admits to walking out on both ``Les
Miserables'' and ``Cats,'' ``which may be just California
vulgarity, but I think we were right.''
</P>
<P>
   Patch credits Newman's ability to write in many musical idioms
to his protean, ``suburban blueslinger'' personality. Despite
growing up in a privileged environment _ the son of a doctor and,
more significantly, the nephew of legendary Hollywood film
composers Alfred Newman and Lionel Newman _ Randy Newman's
anti-romantic songs often adopt the perspective of misfits and
losers, characters with distinct voices and attitudes.
</P>
<P>
   And his conceptual albums ``Land of Dreams'' (1988) and ``Bad
Love'' possess strong narrative through-lines, playing almost like
mini musicals.
</P>
<P>
   `I think most pop songs are written with a lack of specificity,
even good pop songs,'' Patch says. ``If you take Beatles songs like
`I Want to Hold Your Hand,' that's the sentiment and anybody can
sing it. Not everybody can sing `Rednecks.' ''
</P>
<P>
   So what does Newman's stage alter-ego finally learn?
</P>
<P>
   ``He decides that life is all right,'' Newman says. ``Which I
do, simplistic and stupid as it seems. For me to think that is not
a small thing. It's comin' a little way to think that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never thought that life is like a (Charles) Bukowski
novel,'' he continues, referring to the down-and-dirty L.A. author
of ``Barfly.'' ``I never believed in `the world is a cesspool'
theory of art, and `you're just alone and it's a gutter' kind of
thinking. I always felt that people are pretty decent one on one.
You sit next to somebody on a plane, and usually they're all
right....''
</P>
<P>
   Newman hesitates a beat, a smile stealing over his face.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless you're not in First Class, of course.'' &QL;

PALM INC. TO ACQUIRE INTERNET CALENDAR COMPANY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HIAWATHA BRAY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The leading power in palm-based computing is acquiring a
Cambridge, Mass., Internet firm to extend its online presence.
</P>
<P>
   Palm Inc., maker of the popular Palm Pilot handheld devices,
will pay $80 million in cash and stock for AnyDay.com Inc., which
operates a popular Internet calendar and appointment book service.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet is supposed to provide detailed and streamlined
services, and not just be an entertainment medium, and that's what
we're going to do with AnyDay,'' said Bill Maggs, Palm's chief
technology officer.
</P>
<P>
   Palm is upgrading its entire line of PalmPilots to support
wireless Internet access, and the firm plans to build a suite of
Internet information management services around AnyDay.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are the center of their Internet strategy,'' said AnyDay
founder and chief executive Steve Watts.
</P>
<P>
   The acquisition is the first Santa Clara, Calif.-based Palm has
made since being spun off earlier this year from parent 3Com Inc.
There are about six million users of Palm devices, lightweight data
managers busy people can use to keep their lives organized.
</P>
<P>
   But at a time when the Internet has become the most important
tool in computing, only one of Palm's devices has built-in Internet
access, through a wireless modem. Maggs said this is going to
change.
</P>
<P>
   ``By the end of the year, every single Palm is going to be
connectable to the Internet,'' he said. The company plans to offer
a variety of add-on devices that will add Internet access to
existing Palms.
</P>
<P>
   The AnyDay acquisition will give Palm users a central online
repository for personal and business information, one that can be
kept constantly up to date.
</P>
<P>
   Founded in 1998, AnyDay has 1.7 million registered members.
Their free Web site features a calendar, address book, and to-do
list. The service can also be programmed to notify the user about
important events _ a baseball game between the Yankees and Red Sox,
for example, or the opening date of the latest Mel Gibson movie.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, an AnyDay user can post a public version of his
calendar on the Internet, where it can be seen by colleagues or
family members.
</P>
<P>
   Privately held AnyDay had begun seeking its third round of
venture capital when Watts learned Palm was interested in the
company. ``They were missing the Internet,'' he said. ``That's what
we bring into the fold.''
</P>
<P>
   AnyDay will remain in Cambridge; Watts said the firm will serve
as 3Com's main office in the eastern United States.

UP TO HALF WORLD'S FEMALES ARE VICTIMS OF DOMESTIC ABUSE, SAYS
UNICEF 
</HEADLINE>
   By BARBARA CROSSETTE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ The prevalence of domestic abuse of women and
girls around the world is ``alarming,'' UNICEF reported Wednesday,
with statistics suggesting that up to half the female population
comes under attack by those closest to them at some time in their
lives.
</P>
<P>
   The report, ``Domestic Violence Against Women and Girls,'' is a
first effort by UNICEF to establish the global dimensions of this
form of abuse, drawing together already published research from
various countries. And it takes the U.N. agency another step deeper
into an aggressive campaign to address the root causes of the
problems of millions of the world's children.
</P>
<P>
   ``Statistics are grim, no matter which part of the world one
focuses on,'' says the report. No country or region is exempt from
domestic abuse, the report said, but the problem is often most
acute in the poorest countries, or the poorest neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   The study was released ahead of a special General Assembly
session next week to assess advances women have made since the
Fourth World Conference on Women in Beijing in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Under Carol Bellamy, a former New York City council president
and Peace Corps director who is in her second term as UNICEF's
executive director, the agency better known for its education and
vaccination programs has commissioned a series of studies on
women's rights and family and community life. The aim has been to
learn why millions of women, and the children in their care, are
unable to overcome poverty, illiteracy and many other
disadvantages.
</P>
<P>
   Domestic violence has been given too low a priority, Bellamy
said in an interview Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   She said that the new study _ conducted by the agency's
Innocenti Research Center in Florence, using a range of information
from governments, international organizations and academic research
_ defines abuse in the very broadest terms.
</P>
<P>
   It begins with aborted female fetuses or the killing of female
babies and extends to the deliberate under-feeding of girl children
and their lack of access to medical attention, to the sexual abuse
of girls (often in extended families, where they are at the mercy
of uncles and cousins) and the fatal beating of adult women.
</P>
<P>
   ``The earlier it starts, the more it denies them the potential
for the future,'' Bellamy said.
</P>
<P>
   ``People realize that we live in a more violent world these days
generally,'' she said. ``But the fact is that perhaps the most
pervasive violence for women is the violence from those they most
trust, those they know best, those whom they have the most
interaction with _ the family in its broadest sense. People know
this still exists but I'm not sure they recognize the scale on
which it continues.''
</P>
<P>
   Bellamy said that the powerlessness of many of the world's
women, most acute in the developing countries of South Asia and
parts of sub-Saharan Africa, takes on added urgency because of the
rapid spread of the AIDS virus in those parts of the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Africa now, there are more women infected than men, largely
infected by somebody they know _ a secondary result of traditional
practices,'' she said. ``Your husband dies and you have to sleep
with your husband's brother, even though you may know that he's
infected. More women become infected and they are increasingly
younger and younger.''
</P>
<P>
   This trend reflects the powerlessness of women and the denial of
``the right to have a relationship that isn't subject at any moment
to violence.''
</P>
<P>
   Mehr Khan, who directed the research project that produced
Wednesday's UNICEF report said in an interview that although 44 of
the United Nation's 188 member-states have enacted laws against
domestic violence, these are not always enforced by the police and
courts. Attacks on women in their families ``are too often written
off as private issues,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The UNICEF report suggests that women under attack were more
prone to suicide. In the United States, 35 to 40 percent of
battered women try to kill themselves, it said.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Sri Lanka,'' the report said, ``the number of suicides by
girls and women 15-24 years old is 55 times greater than the number
of deaths due to pregnancy and childbirth.''
</P>
<P>
   Incest within extended families is frequent, it said, and ``40
to 60 percent of known sexual assaults within the family are
committed against girls 15 years and under, regardless of region or
culture.''

DAVENPORT LOSES IN FRENCH OPEN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BUD COLLINS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ They looked like Les Miserables, the homeless of Paris,
30,000 soaked and sodden lost souls huddled at Stade Roland Garros,
waiting for the rain to stop Tuesday. It never did. For the only
time in the 75-year-old French Championships, not a single tennis
ball was smacked.
</P>
<P>
   Rain had often interfered, but never triumphed. However, after
nine hours the long-suffering were liberated, sent home clammy and
coughing, and promised refunds. The proprietor, the French
Federation, collected $1 million in a rain insurance payoff, and
five champions slept soundly, probably never dreaming it would be
their last night in town. For three it was.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday appeared cold and shrouded in gray, ominous for the
names _ Carlos Moya, Sergi Bruguera, Lindsay Davenport _ who had
ruled major citadels. But hopeful for no-names, too, such as Erika
de Lone, who had ``waited 11 years'' for such a day: ``my first win
in Paris.''
</P>
<P>
   And for a scrawny Belgian named Dominique Monami Van Roost, so
distraught at her mother's death three months ago that she didn't
want to continue playing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am crying and laughing,'' Dominique said after celebrating
her 27th birthday by overcoming the Wimbledon and Australian Open
champ, No. 2 Davenport, 6-7 (5-7), 6-4, 6-3. ``Usually I cry just
when I lose. But I think this was a wonderful victory mentally,
because I fought within myself these last months. I was not sure I
would start playing again.''
</P>
<P>
   It was one of a panoply of 79 matches spread across 22 crimson
dirt courts from morning till nightfall as the strivers threatened
the mighty, and an anonymous unshaven Frenchman, wild card Anthony
Dupuis, No. 108, thought, wrongly, that he was surely beating the
reigning champion, Andre Agassi. His victory dance was premature.
</P>
<P>
   The jigging Dupuis believed he had taken the opening set
tiebreaker on an ace as his serve whizzed past Agassi. But it
grazed the tape: a let. ``I knew it would be a let as soon as he
served it,'' said Agassi, who, well within himself, debuted with a
7-6 (9-7), 6-3, 6-4 win. ``But the guy told me afterwards that he'd
wished for 10 years to be on a court with me. That was nice.''
</P>
<P>
   But if the gallant Davenport, grimacing in pain and hobbled by
back spasms, could consider herself a spiritual winner after a
losing struggle of 2 1/4 hours, the never gallant _ though gifted _
Chilean, Marcelo Rios, once No. 1 for a few fleeting minutes two
years ago, presented a stark contrast on a nearby court. He
surrendered after two listless sets and 66 minutes against Tommy
Haas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's good to quit after two sets if you haven't
been hurt,'' said Haas, the young German trained at Nick
Bollettieri's boot camp in Florida. ``But I think we all know how
Marcelo is. I don't think he really cares what other people
think.''
</P>
<P>
   Fans who watched Rios splash unprofessionally twice at the US
Pro know what Haas means. Rios said his legs were sore _ ``I think
I'm not here to win one match. I'm here to try to win the
tournament. If I'm not feeling good it makes no sense to play.''
</P>
<P>
   It made sense to do-or-die Davenport, who strained her back at
the Italian Open and ``probably came back a week too soon. I was
feeling pretty good until the last game of the second set when I
hit a serve, and my back went into spasms again, which has been the
problem the last couple of weeks. Then I had trouble reaching up
for the serve.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a tough call about retiring or trying to play through it.
Dominique was playing well. She might have beaten me if I'd been
100 percent. It's the first time I've played a major with something
really wrong. But I really wanted to play. I've never quit a
match.''
</P>
<P>
   Davenport was the first No. 2 to fall in the first round since
Virginia Wade was beaten by Louisianan Linda Tuero in 1971. ``I'm
just going to rest,'' Davenport said, ``and I'm sure I'll be ready
for Wimbledon.''
</P>
<P>
   Gone was her shot at this year's Grand Slam. ``The French has
been my goal since I've won the other three majors,'' she said.
``But my mind-set was to just survive out there today.'' That she
did, in reputation as a true-blue champ.
</P>
<P>
   Lindsay's conqueror, No. 20 Van Roost, was nursed back to mental
stability by her live-in coach, husband Bart Van Roost, after her
mother's long ordeal with cancer. ``We had to work hard, very hard
for me to get back,'' she said. ``Down deep I felt I didn't want to
be hurt again. But everything came together two or three days ago.
I have a lot of luck to have a husband like Bart, a real support.''
</P>
<P>
   Dominique and Bart were the Juliet and Romeo of Belgium when
they married to the tune of great ``political disapproval,'' she
said. She is Walloon, he Flemish. ``For many Belgians it is a no-no
to mix the two. But people get over that.''
</P>
<P>
   The Spanish kings of France, Bruguera (1992-93) and Moya (1998),
were chased by peasants named Juan Balcells, a No. 97 qualifier,
and Hernan Gumy, No. 88.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ah, he's a cuddly Gummy bear,'' proclaimed a female viewer as
the handsome Argentine outlasted Moya, 7-6 (7-4), 6-2, 4-6, 3-6,
6-3, in 3 hours 37 minutes. ``Just a warmup _ remember '98?'' said
Gumy, who lost the most unending of French jousts, to Alex Corretja
in 5:31 two years ago. Balcell's act of lese majeste against
Bruguera _ 6-3, 5-7, 6-2, 1-6, 6-0 _ was even more pronounced since
he, too, is a Spaniard.
</P>
<P>
   But two endangered kings escaped. Michael Chang, the prodigy at
17 in 1989, is spinning his once-marvelous wheels these days, but
won his second-rounder over Swede Thomas Johansson, 7-6 (7-2), 7-6
(7-5), 2-6, 6-3. Russian Yevgeny Kafelnikov, victorious in 1996,
and tied with Rios in the sourness league, finished sweetly enough
over yet another of those rising Argentines, Mariano Zabaleta, 6-2,
3-6, 6-7 (6-8), 6-4, 6-4.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe none of them felt better than the young woman playing for
a gathering 43 of the day's 32,229 patrons, way out in the boonies,
Court 20. That was dauntless campaigner de Lone of Lincoln, Mass.,
with ``the best win of my life'' _ 6-3, 6-2 over the sturdy
Austrian lefthander, Barbara Schwartz, who toppled Venus Williams a
year ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I waited a long time for my first win in Paris,'' said de
Lone. ``Eleven years. I usually lost in qualifying. But I did
qualify twice, but then didn't win. But I didn't have to do that
this year with my No. 75 ranking.''
</P>
<P>
   As she hooked a troublesome serve on match point, her
stepfather, John Plukas, murmured, ``Now I can breathe again.''
</P>
<P>
   So could the French Open, recovered from the Tuesday deluge.

EVEN SOME OF WEB'S BIGGEST FANS ARE FEELING THE BLUES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER J. HOWE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. _ The Internet Blahs are upon us.
</P>
<P>
   The bursting Net-stock bubble has imploded the Nasdaq stock
index. Half of all e-retailers will be dead in a year, reputable
analysts predict. Online shopping and Web surfing feel more and
more like a giant conspiracy to reduce people to narrowly
pigeonholed targets for banner ads and spam mail.
</P>
<P>
   And the recent news that the World Wide Web now counts over 1
billion pages seemed no milestone in human wisdom. Just more
useless material to clog up our search engines when we simply want
to find a good recipe for marinara sauce.
</P>
<P>
   Even some of the Internet's biggest champions are feeling the
blues these days, if the mood at the opening of Harvard
University's third conference on The Internet and Society Wednesday
was a good barometer.
</P>
<P>
   As dozens of leading academics and business people flocked to
Harvard for three days of symposia on how the Net can reshape
everything from education to medicine to urban design, Wednesday's
opening sessions on the future of the Net were dominated by
lamentations of what has gone wrong so far _ with only a few
glimmers of hope for recovering the golden-promise days.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's almost a backlash right now, sort of an enormous
hangover and a retreat from the kind of giddy euphoria'' that
dominated the early and mid-1990s view of the Net's possibilities,
Lotus Development Corp. founder Mitch Kapor said in a speech he
dubbed ``the confessions of a recovering technological utopian.''
</P>
<P>
   A decade ago, in the years after he discovered an early e-mail
community in the San Francisco Bay area, ``I made a number of
speeches in which I said the Internet was going to make everything
better. As we know, that didn't exactly happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Harvard president Neil L. Rudenstine, meanwhile, rejected
suggestions that long-distance learning over the Net will some day
replace traditional colleges and universities. Despite all the ways
the Net has enhanced traditional higher education, in-person
teaching is still ``the most powerful'' mode of education, he said.
</P>
<P>
   More than 1,000 Harvard courses now have extensive Web sites,
Harvard's business school is pioneering new Web-based midcareer
development programs for executives, and e-mail has revolutionized
communications among students and teachers at every school,
Rudenstine said.
</P>
<P>
   But while the Net has enhanced old-line colleges and
universities, ``campus-based residential learning, at least for the
undergraduate and first-degree graduate level, is here to stay,''
Rudenstine said. He said there are too many aspects of college
education, such as learning to appreciate diversity, that ``it's
hard to imagine could be carried out online.''
</P>
<P>
   Pattie Maes, an associate professor in the Media Lab at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said she once believed the
Net would usher in four world-changing trends: leveling the playing
field for small businesses to compete against the large, bringing
``power to the people,'' offering highly personalized information,
and serving as the ``collective mind'' of curious humans
everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't exactly say that all these visions have become
reality,'' Maes said. ``Maybe they are becoming delusions.''
</P>
<P>
   The idea the average person could sell cookies from her kitchen
over the Net, Maes said, has given way to the reality that the
e-commerce world is dominated by ``whoever spends tons of millions
of dollars on advertising.'' One example is the music industry
which, by trying to squelch the Napster music-pirating software, is
showing the Net is not necessarily liberating the proletariat.
</P>
<P>
   Maes said using the Web to get personalized information now
seems like a sure route to mailbox-clogging advertising spam or an
uncomfortably high level of disclosure about people's hobbies and
interests.
</P>
<P>
   And rather than bringing people into a wealth of global
knowledge, Maes said, ``We all suffer from this so-called
information overload. It's extremely hard to find quality
information'' on the Web now.
</P>
<P>
   In each of the four areas of failed promise, Maes said,
specialists at the Media Lab and elsewhere are working on
solutions, with daunting titles such as ``communityware'' and
``collaborative ontology editors.''
</P>
<P>
   Maes's description gave no suggestion a silver bullet is in the
works to solve the Net epidemics of overcommercialization, hype,
and infogarbage. But, she said, ``We're basically all idealists. We
want to make sure this medium will change society for the better.''
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, the pessimism was hardly monolithic. Even Kapor
said, ``There are things about the Internet you have to love if you
have a beating human heart.'' He cited a recent news account of
fishermen in India who now get life-saving weather forecasts for
the Bay of Bengal from a US Navy Web site.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet is very much like the cooking business,'' said
Esther Dyson, chairman of EDventure Holdings and interim chairwoman
of the international governing body that assigns dot-com and
dot-net names.
</P>
<P>
   News accounts are dominated by what's happening at the online
equivalents of McDonald's or the fanciest restaurants in Boston and
New York, Dyson said. ``But even as you read about these things,
there's a huge amount of home cooking going on that you never read
about. That's what's really going on on the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   Tim Berners-Lee, who invented the World Wide Web in 1989 and now
holds a research chair at MIT's Laboratory for Computer Science,
dismissed a question about the proliferation of irrelevant pages on
the Web, saying that the good sites ``are still there. You just
have to have the presence of mind to go there.''
</P>
<P>
   Kapor said he senses, everywhere from the capital markets to the
community of Web surfers, that ``the pendulum is now swinging back
to the middle, having been at the extremes of Internet hype.''

SOME DEMOCRATS UNEASY ON DIRECTION OF GORE CAMPAIGN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   They are nervous spectators as the work in progress that is Vice
President Al Gore's campaign rejiggers his message again this week.
</P>
<P>
   Leading Democrats across the country say there is no reason to
worry too much about polls that show Gore lagging behind Governor
George W. Bush of Texas. Early polls, taken before voters are ready
to focus on presidential politics, are an unreliable gauge, they
say.
</P>
<P>
   But interviews with governors and members of Congress who
support Gore reflected considerable unease at the difficulty Gore
has encountered in the early going deciding what his campaign is
about and how he can best press his case.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been beaten up a little more than he needs to be,'' said
Jim Hodges, the governor of South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   Almost all of these Democrats agreed that the vice president has
stumbled by not quickly settling on a campaign message and
strategy. But they offered varied prescriptions for what Gore
should do and how he should do it.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Governor Tom Vilsack of Iowa said it is too early
for Gore to attack Bush. Governor Paul E. Patton of Kentucky said
Gore must attack Bush, while also promoting himself. And Hodges
said Gore ought to be talking more about education while
aggressively taking on Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you are behind in the polls, it's hard not to attack,''
Hodges said. ``You can't go into a defensive mode if you are
behind.''
</P>
<P>
   The Gore campaign has appeared to lurch from one tactic to the
next since locking up the nomination on March 7. First, Gore seemed
to disappear from sight, taking a low profile while Bush, with a
series of policy proposals, sought to move toward the political
center. Then, campaign officials said Gore would go on the attack,
and, for a stretch, he did, ripping Bush's proposals the way he
attacked Bradley's health care plan during the primaries.
</P>
<P>
   Now the campaign has turned to Plan C, deciding that Gore should
do less attacking and more talking about himself and the issues he
has stressed. Instead of wielding the hatchet himself, Gore now
plans to rely more on surrogates to target Bush.
</P>
<P>
   This week, Jesse Brown, the former head of the Veterans
Administration, questioned an apparent gap in Bush's military
service record, first reported by the Globe. Senator John Kerry
talked to reporters about Bush and national security. And a
Connecticut representative, Rosa DeLauro, has gone on television
news shows to promote Gore's record on mental health, as well as to
deliver floor speeches on Bush shortcomings.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Gore is hoping to soften his image, talking about
how families struggle to take care of their children after school,
about investments in cancer research, and about improvements in
cancer care and prevention. Wednesday he called for a ``new era''
of mental health coverage for children. _ and, in doing so, spoke
in very personal terms about the depression suffered by his wife,
Tipper.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything I'm going to tell you this morning I learned from
Tipper,'' Gore said as he proposed requiring insurance companies to
cover mental health services for children as they do other health
conditions. He also called for mental health training for all new
teachers, and proposed expanding outreach and for treatment
services at a cost of $2.5 billion over 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, Gore will call for encouraging responsible fatherhood as
the next step in welfare reform and for making sure fathers pay
child support and have jobs to support their families.
</P>
<P>
   ``None of these issues really lend themselves to stark
contrasts, other than the fact that Bush is doing nothing about
them,'' said Douglas Hattaway, a Gore spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Vilsack, the Iowa governor who campaigned with Gore throughout
the caucuses, compared the vice president to Rocky Balboa, the
Philadelphia boxer of movie fame.
</P>
<P>
   ``Early in the fight, Rocky would get pummeled, but he'd just
keep plugging away, and at the end of the fight he would be
successful,'' Vilsack said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Vilsack said, it was premature for Gore to be pummeling
Bush. ``It's too early, way too early,'' he said. ``He's got to
establish what his positions are.''
</P>
<P>
   In Kentucky, Patton said Gore has not performed ``as effectively
as I think he will when the campaign really gets in gear.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that Gore must attack Bush as well as talk about
himself, and that he must use surrogates to go after Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it is legitimate to discuss your opponent's perceived
shortcomings,'' Patton said. ``As a practical matter, the vice
president needs to be a spokesperson for the shortcomings of his
opponents and his own strengths.''
</P>
<P>
   Kerry, who is being considered as a possible running mate for
Gore, called it ``crazy early'' to be worrying about polls showing
the vice president trailing Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think for two months he was kind of a little quiet, there
wasn't a lot going on and Bush filled the vacuum,'' Kerry said.
``He should be out there talking about things he said in the
primary when he trounced Bradley: environment, education, where
he's going with kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Hodges, the South Carolina governor, said the polls show that
voters care about a couple of specific issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I were giving advice to Gore, I would focus on education
and health care as the primary issues,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But he also said that Gore should sharpen the differences
between himself and Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can attack in a way that does not appear personal,''
Hodges said. ``The trick for Gore is to attack on the issues
without appearing to be personal.''

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The federal government and many of the nation's
leading telephone companies announced an agreement on Wednesday for
a sweeping reshuffling of phone rates that would dramatically
reduce the bills of tens of millions of less affluent consumers and
lead to less significant cuts for other consumers and businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said the reductions, part of an agreement and an order
by the Federal Communications Commission, amounted to the largest
rate cut in the story of federal telephone regulation.
</P>
<P>
   They said the cuts would have their biggest impact on the poor
and those who use their phones the least. Rates would be reduced by
as much as 50 percent for Americans who make few or no
long-distance calls.
</P>
<P>
   For consumers and businesses that make more long distance calls,
the government predicted reduced costs, although some consumer
groups and Wall Street analysts disagreed with the government's
estimates, suggesting they were too rosy.
</P>
<P>
   Government officials said that they had a commitment from the
long- distance companies to pass on to consumers the benefits of
$3.2 billion in savings from a reduction in the access payments
they make to local telephone companies.
</P>
<P>
   And officials said that experience had demonstrated that when
access charges were last reduced three years ago, the long-distance
companies began engaging in a price war that dramatically lowered
overall phone rates.
</P>
<P>
   But critics and analysts said long-distance companies had been
slow to pass on all of the savings when access charges had been
cut, and that the benefit to consumers from the price wars had been
offset by new fees tacked onto their bills.
</P>
<P>
   Critics and officials agreed, however, that Wednesday's action
would fundamentally reshape the economics of the telephone industry
and marked another major step towards deregulation.
</P>
<P>
   It also is part of an evolution towards a new pricing structure
in which long-distance rates will ultimately be like wireless and
Internet service rates _ either a flat monthly fee or a fee that
entitles the customer to a bundle of minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today's announcement is a giant step forward in rationalizing
pricing,'' said William E. Kennard, chairman of the FCC. ``This is
the most dramatic reduction in telephone service prices in the
history of this agency.''
</P>
<P>
   Kennard said the price changes would take effect in July and
that the order was an effort to accelerate competition by ending
several implicit subsidies.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement and order is the product of more than a year of
intense negotiations between local and long-distance companies and
federal regulators on issues that have divided the local and
long-distance providers from the moment they were created with the
breakup of AT&AMP;T 16 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Telephone executives from most of the nation's top companies
also applauded the order.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the results of today's action start showing up on
customer bills in a month or so, consumers will see that the total
cost of local and long-distance telephone service will be down,''
Duane Ackerman, chairman and chief executive of Bell South, said on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the same time,'' he said, ``those customers who live in
rural areas that are expensive to serve and those people who need
help paying their phone bills will be ensured affordable service
well into the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials said that ultimately the companies reached an
agreement with each other and regulators because of a variety of
important trends, including the blurring of lines between local and
long-distance companies, the competitive threats posed by the
emergence of telephone service on the Internet, and the heavy
pressure put on regulators by a Republican Congress to reduce
regulations and let the marketplace play a greater role in setting
prices.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the agreement, AT&AMP;T said it would eliminate the $3
minimum monthly fee that it charges to millions of customers who
make few or no long- distance calls.
</P>
<P>
   Combined with other changes announced on Wednesday, a typical
monthly bill for an AT&AMP;T customer who makes no long-distance calls
would be cut in half, to $4.68 from $9.39. A customer who made 10
minutes of long-distance calls would have total monthly charges
decrease by 27 percent, from $9.39 to $6.87.
</P>
<P>
   The order simplifies telephone bills by folding two separate
charges _ one for the cost of telephone lines and the other a
special access charge _ into one. It reduces an earlier announced
rate hike for the combined items by 66 cents a month.
</P>
<P>
   The centerpiece of the agreement, spelled out in the summary of
an order that will soon be issued by the commission, reduces by
$3.2 billion the access charges that long-distance companies such
as AT&AMP;T and Sprint pay to local telephone companies such as Bell
Atlantic in order to use their lines at the beginning and end of a
call. The reduction amounts to about a 25 percent cut in access
fees paid to the local companies.
</P>
<P>
   Commission officials said they could not precisely quantify how
much heavy long-distance callers might save, and some analysts and
consumer groups said they doubted that many of the savings would
result in dramatically lower bills. ``We hope that the FCC will
monitor this process to ensure that the $3.2 billion in
long-distance company savings are translated into demonstrable
price reductions for consumers,'' said Gene Kimmelman, co-director
of the Washington office of Consumers Union.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today's decision is a clear benefit for people who make few or
no long- distance calls,'' he said. ``But it still leaves consumers
paying inflated monthly charges.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Scott C. Cleland, a telecommunications analyst at the Legg Mason
Precursor Group, said that experience had shown that the companies
had not passed on savings from reductions in access charges.
</P>
<P>
   ``The companies have a fiduciary responsibility to their
shareholders to not necessarily pass them on,'' Cleland said. ``To
the extent that prices don't fall, these savings increase
long-distance profits. The companies may pass them on, but it will
be over time.''
</P>
<P>
   Industry executives said that the decision was part of a trend
that will inevitably lead to long distance fees resembling the fees
now charged by Internet companies and cell phones.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pricing structure that these rules permit allows us to
moev more in the direction that will ultimately lead to Internet
pricing or wireless pricing in the long-distance market,'' said
John Nakahata, a former top official at the FCC and spokesman for
the coalition of telephone companies that signed the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of the fee changes, local telephone companies stand
to see a short-term shortfall of as much as $500 million over the
next year. But industry executives and analysts said that lower
prices should increase demand more than enough to offset the
shortfall.
</P>
<P>
   ``This industry is growing at a rapid rate and we're all
realizing significant cost reductions,'' said Frank Gumper, vice
president of regulatory and long-range planning at Bell Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   In a partial dissent to Wednesday's order, one commissioner
accused the staff of the FCC of making improper side-deals with the
telephone industry in order to gain its support for the order.
</P>
<P>
   The commissioner, Harold Furchtgott-Roth, said that in exchange
for the industry's support, the staff had agreed waive certain
onerous depreciation rules and rule favorably in a separate access
fee proceeding. Both proceedings involve billions of dollars to the
companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be clear, I do not believe that any employee of this agency
acted in bad faith'' Furchtgott-Roth wrote. ``But I cannot escape
the conclusion that the process by which this notice has been
promulgated falls short of certain fundamental principles that
govern the behavior of administrative agencies.''
</P>
<P>
   Both industry lobbyists and staff officials denied that any
separate deals had been reached.

RALPH NADER IS ON A MISSION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By YVONNE ABRAHAM  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW HAVEN _ It was as close to a photo-op as Ralph Nader was
going to get.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent sunny afternoon, the famed consumer advocate,
surrounded by a moving scrum of supporters and reporters, was
walking down busy Church Street on his way to speak at the Yale
University Co-op.
</P>
<P>
   Some passersby stopped to see what the fuss was about, and,
spotting the gangly, professorial man, some let out exclamations of
recognition: ``Woo! Ralph Nader! Yeah!'' Others looked puzzled.
</P>
<P>
   Did Nader, who is running for president on the Green Party
ticket, stop to wave to his fans or to shake a few potential
converts' hands? Did he explain himself to the uninitiated? Did he
squeeze a shoulder or two and scatter ``Remember me in Novembers?''
</P>
<P>
   No, no, and absolutely not. Head down, stoop-shouldered,
clutching his trademark stuffed brown folder, Nader appeared
oblivious to it all. His people _ a crowd of more than 200, mostly
elderly residents and young followers _ were waiting for him in the
bookstore nearby. Nader, remarkably devoid of charisma despite
nearly 40 years in the public eye, wasn't interested in introducing
himself to the others.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't parade in front of people,'' Nader said.
</P>
<P>
   This is, of course, no way to win the White House. But this is
also a candidate who doesn't talk much of victory in November _ not
of victory in the usual sense. Nader has other goals: Building up a
new progressive party and making mainstream Democrats squirm. He
wanted the same things when he stood for election four years ago,
also on the Green Party ticket, with little effort and even less
success (he drew less than one percent of the vote).
</P>
<P>
   But this time, Nader has a good deal more money in the bank,
some of it from activist celebrities like Paul Newman and Susan
Sarandon. And the contest between the two major party candidates is
so close that, if current poll numbers persist, Nader could prove
quite a headache for Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   A recent Zogby International poll showed Nader drawing 4.4
percent of voters nationally. Reform Party candidate Pat Buchanan,
the higher-profile third party alternative, attracted 2.1 percent.
The margin by which Republican Governor George W. Bush led Gore was
only 3.6 percent. And two of every three votes that Nader attracts,
said pollster John Zogby, come from Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Nader's showing is even stronger on the West Coast, where Gore
is counting on strong support. In California, where Nader has been
involved in tort and HMO reform initiatives in recent years, he
attracts 9 percent. In Oregon, he drew 7 percent. Though only 4
percent of Ohio voters said they would vote for Nader, a recent
Ohio Poll found he had the highest net favorability rating of all
the candidates (Bush had the highest outright positive rating, but
the Texas governor's negative rating was also high).
</P>
<P>
   Gore finished third in that survey, which is fine with Nader,
who lost faith in Democrats years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not concerned with Al Gore,'' he told an audience in
Worcester last week. ``He refuses to compete with me over the
issues. Is there anything keeping Al Gore from coming out strong on
labor laws? Every four years (the parties) get more and more alike.
The only language they understand is to deny them your vote.''
</P>
<P>
   Nader derides Gore, and President Bill Clinton, for their
campaign fund-raising practices, for failing to fight hard enough
for universal health care, and on many other issues. Nader calls
Bush the ``corporate welfare king,'' for making huge profits from
his share of the Texas Rangers after government money helped build
a new stadium for the baseball team. He scoffs at Bush for staging
photo opportunities with children when Texas has the second-highest
hunger rate in the country.
</P>
<P>
   The plague-on-both-your-houses rhetoric played very well with
audiences on Nader's recent swing through New England.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, most people hardly seemed to need convincing.
Nader's crowds were jammed with citizens already hostile to big
business and to politicians they view as selling out to corporate
interests. In Boston, Nader joined a rally on the Common against
the Massachusetts Comprehensive Assessment System, decrying the
standardized exam as a way for test-framers to encroach on public
education. In New Haven, he spoke before residents fighting a new
multimillion dollar, government-subsidized mall.
</P>
<P>
   As he has all over the country, Nader had full command of the
minute details of each cause, using local issues as a preface to
his major themes.
</P>
<P>
   In Hartford, he visited picketing workers at the Avery Heights
retirement community, rattling off details of the dispute, decrying
the disparity between their lower salaries and those in other
nearby nursing homes, and the generous government subsidies used to
build the private, 43-acre community. From there, he launched into
an indictment of ``greedy'' corporations, their grip on government,
and the weakness of organized labor.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to light a fire under the AFL-CIO,'' Nader told the
picketers, ``so that if they endorse someone like Al Gore, they get
thumped in return.''
</P>
<P>
   At the podium, Nader is a good deal more humorous and
self-assured than he is on the street. He packs his addresses with
rhetoric designed to elicit outrage in even the most complacent
liberal: less than 10 percent of private employees belong to labor
unions, the lowest rate in 60 years; 47 million workers make less
than $10 an hour; Bill Gates has as much money as the poorest 120
million Americans' combined. And on it goes.
</P>
<P>
   His pitch draws gasps from his audiences, composed of older
voters who remember his days as a high-profile consumer advocate,
and young leftists disillusioned with mainstream politics.
</P>
<P>
   Nader burst into public view with his 1965 book, ``Unsafe at Any
Speed'' which exposed General Motors's and other auto makers' scant
attention to car safety. Nader also played a prominent role in the
creation of auto safety laws, the Freedom of Information Act, the
Occupational Safety and Health Administration, and the
Environmental Protection Agency, among others.
</P>
<P>
   His profile is much lower nationally these days, but Nader
insists people are still as concerned about corporate corruption,
labor issues and equality now as they were in the 1960s. Instead,
he said, those issues _ along with his own consumer movement _ have
been edged to the margin by news media obsessed with such
spectacles as the Monica Lewinsky scandal and the trial of O.J.
Simpson. ``It is the Roman Circus,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Younger supporters admire Nader because of his combativeness and
disrespect for mainstream politics. He is ``retro-cool'' said
pollster Zogby. His savaging of Bush (``He was born on third base,
and he thought he hit a triple,'' Nader says, borrowing a zinger
from former Texas Governor Ann Richards once aimed at Bush) and
Gore (``He is, shall we say, wooden?'') prove big hits with college
students.
</P>
<P>
   Get corporations out of politicians' ears, Nader said, and such
miracles as prison reform, solutions to poverty, and decent
education for all children will follow. As president, he said, he
would introduce public financing of elections, provide universal
health care, repeal laws which he says hinder trade unions, and
crack down on corporate welfare.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Ralph Nader knows he won't be president. But he hopes
that mounting this campaign will move the public agenda closer to
his priorities. He wants his candidacy to build up the Green Party,
so it will be able to field more candidates for state and local
office. If he wins the nomination at the party convention in Denver
on June 24, as expected, and garners 5 percent of the vote in
November, the Greens will be eligible for federal election funds in
2004.
</P>
<P>
   He hasn't joined the party himself, however. In some states,
rival factions roil the Greens, and Nader doesn't want to get
involved in any of that: ``I want to look outward,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Nader grew up in Winsted, Conn., the son of Lebanese immigrants
who fed him a steady diet of instructive aphorisms and civic
values. They often took him to town meetings, to teach him the
importance of political involvement.
</P>
<P>
   When he was 10, Nader said, he came home from school and his
father, a restaurant owner, demanded of him ``Well, Ralph, what did
you learn today? Did you learn how to think? Or did you learn how
to believe?''
</P>
<P>
   Nader brought a religous devotion to his causes. When General
Motors hired a private detective to investigate him in the
mid-1960s, there was nothing to find. He sued the company for
invasion of privacy, and used the settlement to start his first
watchdog group. He still lives an ascetic life, donating much of
his speaking and writing fees to his causes. He doesn't bother with
such trifles as natty suits and fancy restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   ``He doesn't make money, and when you go out to eat with him,
it's usually a cafeteria,'' said his Harvard Law School classmate
Richard Goodwin. ``He has total monastic dedication.''
</P>
<P>
   On the campaign trail, Nader usually stays overnight with
friends and relatives, and has his assistant drive him long
distances in a rental car. But this time around, such frugality is
more a matter of habit than necessity. Nader said the campaign had
raised about $600,000 so far, and it expected to raise about $5
million, including matching funds. Goodwin, a longtime Democratic
stalwart, hosted a fund-raiser for Nader on May 15 at his home in
Concord, Mass. He is just the kind of voter Nader hopes to attract
in November.
</P>
<P>
   ``Democrats can't just decide that the progressive elements in
their own party don't have to be paid attention to,'' Goodwin said.
</P>
<P>
   Two days later, actor Paul Newman held a fundraiser for Nader in
his Manhattan apartment, which is expected to net between $30,000
and $40,000. Others have followed, including Phil Donahue, Susan
Sarandon, singers Bonnie Raitt and Willie Nelson, and even actor
Warren Beatty, who until recently harbored presidential ambitions
of his own. Nader is especially proud of Beatty's support,
declaring in New Haven: ``Let the defections expand and thrive!''
</P>
<P>
   But those who would teach Democrats a lesson today might not be
willing to actually pull the lever for Nader come November,
particularly if the contest between Bush and Gore remains close.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question is, who do you pull a vote away from?'' asked
Kelly Hanna, a registered Green Party member who heard Nader speak
in New Haven and admires him. ``I agree with making the Democrats
know where they came from, but where do you make your impact?''
</P>
<P>
   Even Sean Corvino, a young voter in a T-shirt with a picture of
Unabomber Ted Kaczynski on it (he says he admires Kaczynski's
writing, not his bombings), said he was worried about the same
thing after Nader's speech in the bookstore.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Bush looks like he'll win, I'll support Gore, and if it
looks like Gore is good to go, I'll lean more to the left,''
Corvino said.
</P>
<P>
   And Goodwin, angry as he is at the Democrats for abandoning
progressives and young voters, said he will probably vote for Gore
after all, because the election looks close.
</P>
<P>
   Gore spokesman Chris Lehane said it was far too early to worry
about Nader's impact on the Democratic vote. He said he was
confident liberal voters would rally behind the Vice President.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a `paper or plastic' choice when it comes down to
Gore and Bush,'' Lehane said.
</P>
<P>
   Nader would probably attract more voters if he were able to
participate in the debates, he said. To be included, he must poll
15 percent, which seems unlikely. But he has vowed to fight Bush
and Gore in any way he can. In any case, he is philosophical about
his run.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people look at third party starts as if the first
election is a final test,'' he told one audience. ``I don't think
about that. I'm very incremental. I'm a patient person.''

<P>
   FRIENDSHIP HEIGHTS, Md. _ Pledging to make mental health care a
priority in his administration, Vice President Al Gore on Wednesday
called for legislation that would force insurance companies to
provide children with comparable coverage for mental illnesses as
for physical ailments.
</P>
<P>
   Appearing with his wife, Tipper, before a group of mental health
professionals and advocates in suburban Washington, Gore described
his proposal for children as a first step toward eliminating
disparities in mental health coverage for adults.
</P>
<P>
   ``People still have insurance plans that actively discriminate
against mental health,'' he said. ``They still don't recognize it
as a treatable illness, just like diabetes or high blood pressure
or heart disease.''
</P>
<P>
   The proposal was part of a package of mental health programs,
some of them not new, that Gore outlined on Wednesday. Those
measures included training teachers and police officers to identify
mental illness, expanding community mental health services and
creating a $3,000 tax credit for families to pay for long-term
care, including in mental institutions.
</P>
<P>
   Achieving parity in insurance benefits for mental and physical
illnesses has become a legislative goal of mental health advocates,
who contend inadequate insurance coverage has discouraged many sick
people from seeking treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Under a 1996 law, group health plans are forbidden to set annual
or lifetime dollar limits on mental health care that are lower than
the limits for general medical and surgical services. But a
congressional report released two weeks ago found that thousands of
companies were violating the law.
</P>
<P>
   Some insurance companies have also skirted the law's
requirements by simply replacing the old dollar limits on mental
health care with numerical limits on outpatient visits, treatment
sessions or days in the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Legislation with bipartisan support in Congress would try to
close such loopholes by prohibiting insurers from setting limits on
the number of outpatient visits or days in the hospital for
treatment of mental disorders that are more stringent than those
for the treatment of physical illnesses.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview on Wednesday, Gore suggested he would support a
version of that legislation, but focused only on children.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to close any loopholes that allow insurers to shirk
their obligations under the law,'' he said. But he did not offer
specifics.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's Republican presidential opponent, Gov. George W. Bush,
signed legislation in Texas in 1997 requiring health insurers to
provide comparable coverage for mental disorders as for physical
diseases.
</P>
<P>
   But Dan Bartlett, a Bush spokesman, said the governor has not
said whether he would support similar federal legislation. Bartlett
added, ``Governor Bush understands the importance of mental health
parity.'' Opponents of Gore's proposal, including many business
groups, argue that it would significantly increase the cost of
health insurance, potentially causing some employers, particularly
smaller ones, to drop their policies. Gore estimated that his plan
for children would increase premiums by less than 1 percent, but
the opponents said the figure could be five times that much.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time you increase costs, you cause people to drop
coverage, and the end result is more people without insurance,''
Frank Coleman, vice president for media relations for the U.S.
Chamber of Commerce. ``The question is, do we want Cadillac
coverage, or do we want to find ways to insure the 40 million
people without coverage, who mostly work for small businesses?''
</P>
<P>
   But mental health advocates heralded Gore's proposal as a
crucial step toward eliminating discrimination against the mentally
ill.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's put his finger on a major problem,'' said Laurie Flynn,
executive director for the National Alliance of the Mentally Ill, a
nonprofit group. ``The lack of adequate coverage brings enormous
economic hardships to families. They can quickly run through
savings, forcing them to re-mortgage houses and dip into college
funds.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore refrained from criticizing, or even mentioning, Bush at
Wednesday morning's event. Indeed, in sharp contrast to his gloomy
attacks on Bush, Gore was almost relentlessly upbeat, repeatedly
describing the current times as ``exciting,'' ``optimistic'' and
``hopeful'' for people with mental illnesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``I truly believe there has never been a more hopeful time for
mental health care in America,'' Gore said. ``We are on the very of
a new era that will bring revolutionary change.''
</P>
<P>
   But the vice president did not hesitate to ask the crowd to
support him, saying that he wanted a ``mandate'' to make mental
health a priority in his administration.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what elections are all about,'' he said. ``Deciding
among ourselves the kinds of changes that we're willing to fight
for, that we are willing to make a priority.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore said the shootings at Columbine High School last year
provided evidence that the federal government needs to help schools
train teachers to identify mentally ill students and to hire mental
health counselors.
</P>
<P>
   ``As Columbine taught us, we can't wait until tragedy strikes to
reach out effectively to troubled young people and give them help
and hope,'' he said.

MARKET PLACE: KLEIN LAWSUIT PUTS WARNECO IN A BIND 
</HEADLINE>
   By LESLIE KAUFMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Calvin Klein Inc. has filed suit to break a licensing
pact with the Warnaco Group Inc., which makes its underwear and
jeans brands, in what many industry insiders consider an act of
vengeance against the flint-tough chief executive of Warnaco, Linda
J. Wachner.
</P>
<P>
   Last October, Klein and his long-time partner Barry Schwartz
engaged the investment firm of Lazard Freres to find a buyer for
their private company. Tommy Hilfiger Inc., Liz Claiborne and
Warnaco were among the companies that expressed interest. But none
was willing to bite at Klein's asking price, said to be $1 billion.
Part of the problem was that the brand was already highly exposed _
Klein's name appears on everything from sunglasses to bed linens _
and therefore did not offer prospective buyers an obvious path for
dynamic future growth.
</P>
<P>
   But Klein's long-term licensing deal with Warnaco complicated
the picture as well. Warnaco accounted for some $1 billion of the
$2.5 billion in Calvin Klein products sold wholesale in 1999, and
Wachner has pressed for more control of design and distribution.
While Klein insists that he could have sold the company if he
wanted to and that the new lawsuit is unrelated, he says that
Wachner scared off prospective partners. ``People have told us that
they were hesitant to have a relationship with Linda Wachner,'' he
said in an interview Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Wachner insists that Klein's lawsuit, filed in U.S. District
Court in New York on late Tuesday, was a complete surprise and that
she first learned of it Tuesday night by phone call while in a
design meeting in the offices of Calvin Klein Inc. ``One must
wonder why having tried and failed to sell their business that they
have adopted this tact now,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   David Wolfe, creative director of The Doneger Group, a retail
consulting firm, and one of the many people in New York's Garment
District enjoying the fight, put it bluntly: ``This is about
Calvin's failure to cut a deal. He is kicking her while she is one
the defensive. He grew up in the Bronx. He is a streetwise kid. It
will really be fascinating to watch it play out.''
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit seeks to terminate Warnaco's long-term license to
make Calvin Klein jeans on the grounds that the company has
breached its fiduciary duty by ``diluting''the quality of Klein's
image. Among the specific infractions cited is selling new products
through unauthorized mass-marketers like Costco and B.J.'s. and
affixing the Klein name to products made by other designers or
products designed by Klein but altered without his consent.
</P>
<P>
   Klein and Schwartz insist the suit is an instrument of last
resort, after years of complaints through letters, personal
meetings and lawyers. Schwartz said the issue came to a head in
March when Warnaco handed over a list of its retail clients, and
the top six, which accounted for over $200 million in sales in
1999, were unauthorized off-priced outlets. ``It was clear to us
then that this was a pre-meditated strategy to destroy the
trademark,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Wachner says she is baffled by Klein's allegations. ``I am not
going to respond to a lawsuit I have not yet seen,'' said Wachner,
`` but it is without merit.'' She added that all Warnaco's
licensing and royalty agreements have been clearly known to the
Klein partners since last fall, when they requested the information
to share with perspective buyers.
</P>
<P>
   ``She is a liar,'' Schwartz responded. ``She can say anything
she wants to the press, but let her say that in court.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the merits of the suit, the timing could not be more
devastating to Wachner. Warnaco, which produces underwear and
clothing under numerous names beside Klein's, has seen its stock
price plunge for almost a year, as the company has repeatedly
missed earnings estimates. Wednesday, the news of Klein's suit
pushed the stock to a 52-week low of $6.688, down from a high of
nearly $30 a share last June. Wachner, whose compensation ranks
among the top chief executives in the nation despite her company's
dismal performance, is already a target of irate shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   The complaint singled out Wachner as the source of friction
between the companies. It called her ``abusive and
unprofessional,'' a topic Klein angrily expanded on in an
interview. ``She runs it like a monarchy,'' Klein said of Wachner's
performance at Warnaco. ``She is abusive to our people. Verbally,
the language is disgusting.''
</P>
<P>
   At least in the short term, the Klein suit will surely put the
already cash-strapped Warnaco into more of a bind. ``No one is
going to step into the gap and be by her side financially,'' said
Josie Esquivel, who is a stock analyst at Morgan Stanley. However,
the long-term effect will depend on how the court rules, and
long-time Wachner watchers don't count her out. ``She has shown
great wherewithal,'' Esquivel noted.

TIPPER GORE STEPS INTO THE SPOTLIGHT AT MENTAL HEALTH FORUM 
</HEADLINE>
  (With GORE-MENTAL-HEALTH) 
 By JAMES DAO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   FRIENDSHIP HEIGHTS, Md. _ After having kept a low profile on the
campaign trail in recent months, Tipper Gore, the wife of Vice
President Al Gore, emerged Wednesday in the kind of setting where
she clearly feels most comfortable: a forum on mental health
policy.
</P>
<P>
   Tipper Gore has never seemed to relish the campaign trail,
trying to maintain her privacy beyond the glare of the public
spotlight trained on her husband. ``I think the way for people to
understand me the best is for you to understand that I'm not really
of the political milieu,'' she told a reporter last year.
</P>
<P>
   But Gore has also taken an increasingly public role as an
advocate for mental health care, serving as an adviser to President
Clinton and helping to organize the first White House Conference on
Mental Health last year.
</P>
<P>
   So Wednesday's appearance before a group of mental health
professional in suburban Washington, where she shared a stage and a
microphone with her husband, offered the perfect blending of
politics and policy, an opportunity to promote her pet issue and
her husband's candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need a president who understands the importance of health
care and mental health care,'' she told the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Her husband, she added, did not just care about mental health in
the abstract. ``He has lived it,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   That was a reference to her own battle with depression, which
she disclosed in a newspaper article a year ago. In that article,
Gore said she had been treated for depression after the couple's
6-year-old son was severely injured in an automobile accident in
1989. Her aides say she is no longer under treatment.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Gore _ who earned a master's degree in
psychology from Vanderbilt University _ described the disclosure of
her depression as a liberating experience. Since then, people
ranging from airline stewardesses to Congressmen have told her that
she had helped them discuss their mental problems openly, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way I've been treated differently,'' she said, ``is people
approaching me, being happy, being joyful and open, saying, `Thank
you, thank you.'''
</P>
<P>
   Gore's appearance Wednesday fit neatly into efforts by her
husband's campaign this week to cast the vice president _ who has
come under criticism from some Democrats as overly negative on the
stump _ in a more positive, family-oriented light. But both Gores
bristled at the suggestion that Wednesday's event was in any way
choreographed by his advisers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This event's been planned for months,'' the vice president
said.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout Wednesday's event, and then during the joint
interview, the Gores were a picture of mutual solicitousness,
stepping out of each other's way in answering questions and
praising each other's commitment to the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``You should know that I agree with everything she says,'' the
vice president said in the interview. Without missing a beat, his
wife replied, ``But he sets the policy.''

SATHER APPOINTMENT EXPECTED TO USHER IN NEW RANGER ERA 
</HEADLINE>
   By JASON DIAMOS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ After nearly a month of negotiations with Madison
Square Garden President Dave Checketts and Cablevision boss James
Dolan, Glen Sather will be formally introduced Thursday as the New
York Rangers' new team president and general manager at a Madison
Square Garden news conference.
</P>
<P>
   Several National Hockey League officials confirmed that Sather
had agreed to a five-year contract believed to be worth $15
million, including stock options in Cablevision.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's definitely got complete control,'' a league official said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The 56-year-old Sather, who flew to New York from his La Quinta,
Calif., home Wednesday with his wife, Ann, was customarily coy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now why do you think they're having a news conference?''
Sather asked with a laugh.
</P>
<P>
   Sather's first assignment would be to try to persuade Kevin Lowe
to coach the Rangers. One person close to Sather said that he had
asked Lowe, who was Sather's head coach in Edmonton last season, to
meet him in New York Wednesday, so that he could introduce him as
the Rangers' new head coach.
</P>
<P>
   Lowe, the person said, declined because he needed more time to
make a decision. Edmonton's 37-man ownership group has asked Lowe
to succeed Sather as general manager. Lowe said he would probably
make up his mind early next week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't see it going much longer than that,'' Lowe said
Wednesday. ``It's 50-50 either way. But more so, it's do I want to
be a general manager or a coach, rather than New York or
Edmonton.''
</P>
<P>
   The decision for Sather was simpler. He set it in motion himself
when he chose to resign his posts as team president and general
manager in Edmonton, May 19, after 24 years in the Oilers'
organization, the last 21 as general manager.
</P>
<P>
   Sather had grown tired of having to answer to 37 owners,
especially after Cal Nichols succeeded Sather's good friend, Jim
Hole, as chairman of the Edmonton ownership group. In New York,
Sather will still have to answer to Checketts, a league official
said. But Sather will also be given a wide berth within which to
work in his new role.
</P>
<P>
   Once Sather indicated to The New York Times, on April 19, that
he would listen to offers from other teams, it became immediately
apparent that he was the Rangers' first and only choice to succeed
Neil Smith. Smith was fired as Rangers' president and general
manager, March 28, along with Coach John Muckler.
</P>
<P>
   Sather, Checketts and Dolan first met in the first week of May
and have met and spoken several times since. There is a certain
irony in Sather's acceptance of the Rangers' offer, however. For
years, in Edmonton, he was the outspoken champion of small-market
Canadian teams, a fiscal conservative who routinely criticized the
free-spending ways of teams like the Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   And now, Sather is taking over a team with a seemingly unlimited
budget _ a league record $61.2 million last season _ and attempting
to lure Lowe to come with him, presumably with the just the kind of
offer that incensed Sather when he was in Edmonton.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers do represent a very different sort of challenge for
Sather, who played left wing for the Rangers for parts of four
seasons from 1970-73. As a coach and general manager, Sather
assembled the Oilers' dynasty that won five Stanley Cups. But the
Oilers, mired in fiscal constraints, won their last cup in 1990.
This is Sather's chance to prove that, given the resources, he has
not lost his touch.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers have not qualified for the playoffs the last three
seasons, since Mark Messier left the team in a messy divorce in the
summer of 1997. Sather's hiring is the surest sign yet that
Messier, who led the Rangers to their first Stanley Cup in 54 years
in 1994, will return to the Rangers this summer and be allowed to
finish his career in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Messier, who will become a free agent July 1, if Vancouver does
not pick up the $6 million option on his contract, was the
unquestioned leader of all five of Edmonton's cup winners, and
their captain in 1990. Lowe was Messier's teammate on all five of
those cup-winning teams in Edmonton, and again with the Rangers
when they won in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Those Rangers were known as Edmonton East. The Rangers have been
looking to the Oilers' organization to right their ills ever since.
</P>
<P>
   And with all the Rangers have to offer Lowe financially, could
Lowe be far behind?
</P>
<P>
   Lowe made $450,000 in Edmonton this season, and will make
$625,000 next season. Sather could easily double the likely
$700,000 the Oilers are believed to be offering him to become their
general manager.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're still in the process of negotiating,'' Nichols said
Wednesday. ``We mutually are intending to get somewhat close if we
can by the weekend. And even if we don't have an agreement, we hope
to have enough to say we think we're there. That's our intention.''
</P>
<P>
   Sather obviously has very different intentions. And Nichols has
indicated many times in the last two weeks that he would not ask
the Rangers for any compensation if Lowe accompanies Sather to New
York. Both Lowe and his assistant coach, Craig MacTavish, became
free agents once Sather resigned.
</P>
<P>
   ``And if it comes down to that,'' Lowe said, meaning that he
chooses to continue coaching, ``I would be happy to accept the
challenge. I would love to come back to New York. But let's cross
that bridge when we come to it.''

 By PETER MARKS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Gore Coverup Revealed!'' read the headline on the e-mail
message from Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The five-paragraph missive, beamed into electronic mailboxes of
reporters across the country last week, was another swipe at Vice
President Al Gore by the Republican National Committee. But it was
not a suggestion of political corruption or obstruction of justice
that had prompted the official Republican bulletin. It was a report
that Gore wore makeup.
</P>
<P>
   ``This can't be Naomi Wolf's idea of an alpha male!'' the
message quoted Jim Nicholson, the Republican national chairman, as
having joked about a recent article in People magazine that said
Gore used spray-on cosmetics.
</P>
<P>
   Hour by hour, the e-mail arrives like digital daggers from the
candidates and their parties. Catty, pithy, weighty, gossipy, the
messages materialize via the open cyberfaucet of the 2000 campaign.
``Bush's Million Mom Manipulation,'' began a message from the
Democrats. ``Democrat Fat Cat Discriminates Against Those Who Flee
Castro's Clutches,'' read one from the Republicans. ``New York
Honor Guard Spat On at Clinton Nomination,'' read another.
</P>
<P>
   Only by extension is the target of the computer missives the
American voter. The more immediate audience is the American
journalist. ``Day 52: Reporters Held Hostage!'' screamed the
headline of e-mail from the Republican National Committee in April.
One of a series of such messages from the committee, it was
intended to remind the press that the vice president had not held a
news conference in 52 days. Under an illustration of political
writers from Newsweek and The Washington Post in the stocks, it
implored, ``Mr. Gore, please let these reporters go!''
</P>
<P>
   Campaigns, of course, have always whispered nasty little
nothings about the opposition into reporters' ears. But just as
e-mail has ushered in a new era of epistolary ease and
connectedness for the world at large, it has also created a
hyper-efficient form of press release, a paperless document that
not only links the political world to the nation's assignment
editors, columnists and news anchors in seconds, but also allows
the campaigns to fire at each other at will, all day long.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, a presidential campaign is no longer so much a
series of stops as an endless wave. Gaze at the laptop screen of
any political reporter on the road these days and see how rapidly
campaign e-mail accumulates: the Message of the Day has given way
to the Message of the Last 10 Minutes. And, not surprisingly, in
the proliferation of messages comes all manner of information:
useful, irrelevant or irreverent.
</P>
<P>
   Nicholson's alpha-male crack, for instance, made it onto the
Perspectives page of the current issue of Newsweek, and the
``reporters held hostage'' messages were noted by several
newspapers and television commentators in April. (Late that month,
after the count had passed 60 days, Gore held a news conference.)
</P>
<P>
   The ability to express so much is transforming campaign
back-and-forth into a kind of online bile duct.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything keeps speeding up, and becoming less profound in
the process,'' said Howard Fineman, a political analyst for
Newsweek and MSNBC.
</P>
<P>
   Like many reporters, Fineman is ambivalent about all this
e-mail, perplexed by the tone and the volume but anxious about the
consequences of not receiving it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have several e-mail addresses,'' he said, ``and I just keep
establishing new ones to get away from the old ones. And maybe once
a week, I manfully press the `control-A' combination, which
highlights all of the e-mail, and then I hit the delete button.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course,'' he added, ``in the spirit of confession, I have
to say that when I found that I wasn't on the latest version of the
Gore campaign's e-mail list, I called them up and gave them a piece
of my mind.''
</P>
<P>
   Any political operation of any importance today is online with a
vengeance, and e-mail has become the baseline conveyance that the
telephone and the fax machine once were. (Mention old-fashioned,
Postal Service-type mail to campaign press secretaries, and they
burst into laughter.)
</P>
<P>
   The message via computer is equal parts invasive and discreet.
``Right now, people take it more like a phone call than a press
release,'' observed Clifford D. May, director of communications for
the Republican National Committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``The difference is, it's a phone call that's not in real
time,'' he added. ``So I may e-mail to financial columnists that Al
Gore says he owns no stocks whatsoever: `Either he's not telling
the truth or he's a financial dolt. Don't you think you should
write about it?'''
</P>
<P>
   The advantage? ``You're not interrupting someone on deadline. I
suppose you could do that on a voice mail, but on e-mail you can
take your time to compose the message, to make it as persuasive as
you possibly can.''
</P>
<P>
   Reporters are by training disposed to discount the persuasion of
the press release. But the campaigns and their allies insist that
e-mail has made it easier to get their story into print or on the
air faster. Jennifer Backus, press secretary for the Democratic
National Committee, said that as the first round of news-agency
accounts was transmitted during Republican presidential debates in
the primary season, her staff would immediately respond to those
accounts by sending e-mail to the writers _ and could see the
results as quickly as the next cycle of reports that evening. By
then, she said, the reports were reflecting the Democrats' own
assessment of the Republican debate.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   And in the game of rapid response _ getting your message out
before your opponent's can make an impact _ e-mail delivered with
surgical precision can pre-emptively alter the flow of a major
story.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was funny,'' said Craig Crawford, editor in chief of the
online political digest Hotline. ``My e-mail sound file is from
`2001: A Space Odyssey,' and early one morning HAL goes, `You have
received a message.' It was Al Gore's people with a response to the
Social Security plan that Bush put out.''
</P>
<P>
   The oddity was that the message arrived before Gov. George W.
Bush held the news conference where he formally unveiled his
proposal to partly privatize Social Security. ``Before the sun was
up, I had Bush's plan and Gore's response,'' Crawford said.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Lehane, press secretary for the Gore campaign, says the
strategy, which he calls ``pre-buttal'' _ had the desired effect;
the degree to which major newspapers reflected Gore's objections
surprised even Lehane. Normally, he said, as much as 90 percent of
the content might be devoted to the candidate making the proposal.
With the rapid response, he said, ``my sense is you get 60-40
play.''
</P>
<P>
   There is a rollicking tabloid gusto in the tone of campaign
e-mail, whether the Bush campaign is reinforcing the idea that Gore
stretches the truth (in its continuing series ``The Gore
Detector'') or the Gore campaign is hammering away at Bush's record
in Texas (``one of the dirtiest states in the nation'').
</P>
<P>
   In a message posted last Friday, the Democratic National
Committee renewed its daily efforts to get under Bush's skin with
the suggestion that his campaign was trying to conceal a deeply
conservative agenda. ``Today marks eight days that George W. Bush
has refused to release a tape copy or a transcript of remarks he
made to a far-right conservative organization last October,'' the
message said.
</P>
<P>
   It arrived minutes before a Bush campaign bulletin intimating
that Gore was not telling voters the truth about his Social
Security plans, that he would either raise taxes or cut retirement
benefits. Earlier in the day, the Gore campaign went online to say
Bush had spoken to the Catholic Press Association ``without
mentioning his very public embrace of anti-Catholic Bob Jones
University during the Republican primary.'' Which came on the heels
of Bush e-mail that summed up the week's events as ``Bush Leads,
Gore Flounders.''
</P>
<P>
   Not only can e-mail circulate instantly, its recipients can
forward it instantly: the virtual equivalent of stuffing fliers
under thousands of windshields simultaneously. Campaign spokesmen
say this can make the technology a useful way to talk to their rank
and file as well as to reporters.
</P>
<P>
   The parties and the campaigns maintain that so far, e-mail to
those supporters has been used as a means of circulating favorable
news articles and marshaling the troops rather than as a tactical
weapon against an opponent. ``When Gore was going to a specific
part of the country,'' Lehane said, ``we used e-mail to recruit
volunteers to go.''
</P>
<P>
   It can also be just plain fun. Along with posting presidential
candidate schedules (``The vice president remains overnight in
Memphis'') and innocuous news tidbits (``Wisconsin Veterans Back
Bush''), the campaigns engage in an endless cyberspace version of
trash talk.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic National Committee, in installments of a feature
called ``Bush Lite,'' makes merciless sport of Bush's semantic
gaffes and failures to communicate. ``Bush Confused Canadian Prime
Minister With Canadian Cheese Curd Snack Treat,'' read an item that
the Democrats posted on April 24.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican National Committee replies with a daily watch of
Gore's lack of formal endorsement by former Sen. Bill Bradley.
``Missing,'' says the mock-up of a milk carton with the likeness of
Bradley and the words ``Got endorsement?'' emblazoned on the side.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sophomoric humor is a huge piece of this,'' Lehane said.
``It's got to go so over the top that people pay attention.''
</P>
<P>
   Short attention spans are, after all, another hallmark of the
age of instant media gratification, an age when the saddest fate to
befall a short and punchy computer message is that it be ignored. A
fate that is alas inevitable for some electronic mail when messages
are arriving in batches faster than you can say ``download.''
</P>
<P>
   As May, the Republican spokesman, himself acknowledged, ``I have
188 unread e-mails in my queue at the moment.''

BUSH PLANNING TO GRANT TEMPORARY REPRIEVE TO DEATH ROW INMATE 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: The 2nd take is scheduled to move by 9:45 p.m. ET) 
 By RICHARD A. OPPEL Jr. with FRANK BRUNI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ Gov. George W. Bush of Texas said Wednesday that he was
``more than likely'' to grant a temporary reprieve for a man
scheduled to be executed on Thursday so that DNA evidence in the
case could be tested. It would be the first such stay Bush has
issued as governor.
</P>
<P>
   The case of Ricky Nolen McGinn, 43, who was convicted of raping
and killing his 12-year-old stepdaughter in 1993, has slowly and
quietly been working its way through the Texas legal system. But
with Bush, a vigorous supporter of the death penalty, now the
presumptive Republican presidential nominee, the case has begun to
take on political significance. Bush made his statements about the
case a day after the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals, the the
state's highest criminal court, refused to accept the
recommendation of a lower court that the execution be delayed so
sophisticated DNA tests could be conducted. The appeals court gave
no reason for its refusal.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush told reporters covering his campaign that he was
inclined to grant a 30-day reprieve so that McGinn could ``have his
full day in court.''
</P>
<P>
   ``To the extent that DNA can help in innocence or guilt,
particularly in death penalty cases, but in all cases, I think
that's very valid, very important,'' he said at a news conference
in Scottsdale, Ariz.
</P>
<P>
   Asked why he was telegraphing his intentions before making a
final decision, he said: ``I believe this is a case where it's
important for me to send a signal about what I may do because it's
a case where we're dealing with a man's innocence or guilt.'' As
Bush was talking about the case, the state's Board of Pardons and
Paroles, whose members he appoints, voted 11-7 against recommending
a reprieve. But the governor is not bound by it. At McGinn's trial
five years ago, DNA tests of hair and semen samples taken from the
body and clothing of the victim, Stephanie Rae Flanary, were
inconclusive. But lawyers for McGinn, who says he is innocent, say
advances in DNA testing could now yield conclusive results if the
evidence were retested.
</P>
<P>
   Since taking office, Bush has overseen 130 executions _ more
executions than any other governor in the nation _ and has made
speeding the pace of executions a priority. He has backed
legislation in Texas curtailing attempts, as he has described it,
by convicted murderers ``to endlessly delay justice by repeatedly
filing court appeals.'' He maintains that every one of the
prisoners executed during his tenure were guilty and had
appropriate access to the courts.
</P>
<P>
   But speaking via teleconference to a gathering of Catholic
journalists in Baltimore last week, he said he supports DNA testing
to ``erase any doubts'' about a condemned prisoner's guilt. Bush
aides also note that the governor has pardoned two convicted sex
offenders including an East Texas man pardoned Wednesday after DNA
tests proved their innocence.
</P>
<P>
   Under Texas law, the governor only has the ability to grant a
one-time 30-day reprieve to a condemned prisoner; he can commute a
death sentence, as Bush has done once, but only if the Texas Board
of Pardons and Paroles recommends that action.
</P>
<P>
   Since Bush is traveling out of the state, and Lt. Gov. Rick
Perry is out of the country, the decision on whether to act in
McGinn's case technically falls to the state senate's president pro
tem, Rodney Ellis, a liberal Democrat from Houston who in the past
has clashed with Bush over criminal justice legislation. A
spokesman for Ellis said Wednesday that he had not yet decided what
to do in McGinn's case, but virtually no one expects him to allow
the execution to take place under the circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday afternoon, Bush told reporters he had contacted Ellis'
office to say he was leaning toward a reprieve. ``I'll make a
decision tomorrow morning,'' Bush said. ``I have the authority to
recommend to the chain of command'' what to do, he said.
</P>
<P>
   McGinn's lawyers have filed 11-hour motions with the 5th U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans, and Bush said he would
await that court's decision before acting. Should the courts not
halt the execution, ``I'm more than likely to grant the 30-day
reprieve,'' he said, adding that his staff is reviewing how to
ensure that the DNA evidence gets retested. ``We're now researching
the procedure to make sure the DNA gets evaluated.''

TEXAS GOES WITH FEDS ON STANDARDS FOR CLEANER CARS &HT;    
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By BILL DAWSON 
c.2000 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
 &QL;
<P>
   (Undated) State officials' long-awaited decision on how to bring
cleaner cars to Texas drew praise Wednesday from Gov. George W.
Bush, U.S. officials and automakers.
</P>
<P>
   But environmentalists mixed their applause with criticism for
the action by the three Bush-appointed members of the Texas Natural
Resource Conservation Commission.
</P>
<P>
   As expected, the commissioners voted unanimously to keep Texas
on the list of states where new federal rules will dictate the
introduction of less-polluting cars and light trucks, starting with
the 2004 model year.
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials estimate these regulations will boost the
average new vehicle price by about $200.
</P>
<P>
   With their decision, the TNRCC commissioners declined to choose
the only option available under federal law _ adopting an
alternative set of California emission rules for new vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   In December, Bush urged the commissioners to consider adopting
the California rules, favored by many environmentalists, as they
developed new smog-reduction plans for Houston and other areas this
year.
</P>
<P>
   His message was widely interpreted as a thinly veiled hint that
he preferred the California option to the federal rules, which were
negotiated with automakers by the Democratic administration of his
expected presidential opponent, Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, however, a spokesman for the Republican governor
expressed no disappointment at the decision to keep Texas in the
federal program.
</P>
<P>
   Bush asked the TNRCC commissioners to select ``the best solution
for Texas'' and ``it appears they came up with a plan with some of
the best ideas from both the federal and California plans,''
spokesman Mike Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   Both the federal and California rules will require automakers to
phase in the sale of models with much lower emissions from cars and
light trucks.
</P>
<P>
   TNRCC officials concluded the two sets of regulations would be
roughly equivalent in reducing nitrogen oxides, the combustion
byproducts targeted in new smog-reduction plans for Houston, Dallas
and other Texas cities.
</P>
<P>
   Talks leading to the commissioners' action, however, focused
largely on other pollutants _ smog-forming chemicals that evaporate
from vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   These negotiations led to promises by automakers to include
tighter controls for these gasoline fumes, required only by the
California rules, on the vehicles they sell in Texas and other
states under the federal program.
</P>
<P>
   With those pledges in hand, TNRCC officials claimed credit
Wednesday not only for taking steps to clear the air in Texas _ a
huge automotive market _ but also nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we accomplished is that we got the automakers to do this
for 49 states,'' Commissioner Ralph Marquez said.
</P>
<P>
   Tom ``Smitty'' Smith, Texas director of Public Citizen, an
environmental and public interest group that urged adoption of the
California rules, said the commissioners ``should be complimented
for having negotiated a deal with the automakers that will probably
lead to the California (vapor) standard for the whole country.''
</P>
<P>
   But Smith said he still has ``grave concerns'' about the
agreement, because Texas officials have no power to enforce it.
</P>
<P>
   On another key issue, Marquez said he never got the level of
assurance he wanted from automakers and the U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency that the federal rules will guarantee the
availability of large numbers of extra-clean ``alternative
vehicles'' in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I'll confess to you, I think this is the best we can work
out,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Besides mandating much cleaner models powered by conventional
engines, the federal and California rules both aim to bring
``alternative'' models to the market _ but by different means.
</P>
<P>
   California's rules require the sale of a certain percentage of
these vehicles, which are expected to include electric,
gasoline-electric and fuel-cell models.
</P>
<P>
   The federal rules, adopted last December by the Clinton
administration, instead require each manufacturer's fleet to meet
an average emission level.
</P>
<P>
   Gloria Bergquist, spokeswoman for the Alliance of Automobile
Manufacturers, said the federal approach will ``essentially
require'' that citizens of Texas and other states have the same
access to ``alternative'' vehicles that California residents have.
</P>
<P>
   Gregg Cooke, Dallas-based regional administrator of the EPA,
said its officials are convinced the federal rules will result in a
``fleet mix'' including ``alternative'' models.
</P>
<P>
   Smith remained unconvinced, however, charging that the federal
approach will not do as much to force the development of new,
cleaner automotive technologies.

GAME 1 LOSS WAS JUST PLAIN EMBARRASSING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY GALLOWAY 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ Logic says the Stars will have at least
a Stanley Cup-runneth-over of motivational factors for Game 2 here
tonight. And embarrassment would seem to be a good place to start.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's too late for that,'' Ken Hitchcock said. ``Embarrassment
won't work once you've advanced this far \Rin the postseason\S.
Basically, both teams got to this point by being able to
psychologically write off a loss, adjust, and come back.''
</P>
<P>
   Beg to differ, Hitch. That 7-3 thing. That was embarrassment.
</P>
<P>
   ``What difference does it make _ tough loss or embarrassing
loss?'' answered the Stars coach following yesterday's practice,
which came 12 hours after Tuesday night's Game 1 shell-shocking.
``You still have to write it off and go adjust for the next game,''
Hitch added.
</P>
<P>
   Not that Hitchcock's players automatically fall in step with his
public opinions, but defenseman Richard Matvichuk, one of many
Stars who won't hesitate to think independently from the coach, was
mostly in agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Overall, I don't know about embarrassment,'' Matvichuk said,
``except that Eddie \RBelfour\S has been there for us all season,
and then we leave him hanging out there like we did. Now that is
embarrassing.''
</P>
<P>
   OK, moving right along to the next motivation point following
7-3. What about pride?
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, you're on to something,'' Hitchcock said. ``Pride is a
much bigger factor for the next game.''
</P>
<P>
   What then is the difference in pride and embarrassment?
</P>
<P>
   ``Pride involves your own play, and in using all the elements
that got you here as a team,'' Hitchcock said. ``\RGame 1\S was not
about what they did, it was about what we didn't do. This series
won't be about what they are doing. It will be about what we do.''
</P>
<P>
   Then why have the Stars had these playoff games in each round
thus far where what they do is nothing short of, well,
embarrassing?
</P>
<P>
   Matvichuk: ``I'd love to know the answer to that. If I knew,
then we wouldn't be having those kind of games. We all hate it when
we play like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Hate? Isn't that another possible motivational point for Game 2?
</P>
<P>
   ``They scored seven goals on us. I hate them for that,''
Matvichuk said. ``We had played three straight series \REdmonton,
San Jose and Colorado\S where the hate just came natural. But there
was no good reason to hate New Jersey. Then came those seven goals.
We learned to hate these guys in a hurry.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe even Hitchcock did, too. Why else was he heaping praise
upon the Devils' speed and quickness with their forwards
immediately after Game 1, but yesterday simply gave a hand wave to
dismiss that as a factor?
</P>
<P>
   ``We've played against that kind of speed before, and we've
played against a lot of good lines,'' he said, doing a 180-spin
from his postgame comments. ``If we get our game going, from the
goalie to the puck movement, then we'll be where we want to be.''
</P>
<P>
   And then the Hitch who had said after Game 1 that the emotional
and physical transition from the Game 7 against the Avalanche was
no excuse for what happened here, added this: ``I wasn't surprised
by what happened \Rin Game 1\S. We were a couple of days behind
them, energy-wise. We've got to get caught up.''
</P>
<P>
   What's this? Hitch hinting at a excuse for that embarrassment in
Game 1? Which is the same question for Belfour when he talked after
Game 1 about medication for a head cold making him sluggish in
goal. An excuse best kept private?
</P>
<P>
   ``With Eddie it wasn't an excuse, it's just a fact,'' Hitchcock
said. ``When I saw him that afternoon before the game I knew he
wasn't himself. He didn't react like himself on the first goal,
either.''
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe on the next five. Hmmmmm. Motivational factors would
seem to be in the Stars' favor for tonight, but the excuses, if
that's what they were, sounded cheap yesterday. All that really
matters, however, is the Stars having so much to prove tonight, and
improve on.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can promise this will be a very physical game,'' added
Matvichuk, who plays a lead role in such things. Matvichuk acted
surprised to hear and read the ESPN and New York media lauding the
Devils for winning all the physical battles in Game 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was nothing physical about that game at all,'' said
Matvichuk, ``and that's the reasons we looked like we did. Being
physical is the key to how we play. That starts with Derian
\RHatcher\S and myself, and I think he'd agree neither one of us
did our job. That will change immediately. It's going to have to
become a war. After us giving up seven goals, what else can it
become?''
</P>
<P>
   Despite denials all around, Matty was sounding as if
embarrassment would indeed be a motivational factor for Game 2.
Embarrassment and then hate, too. If so, maybe the Stars are
finally ready to begin play in the Stanley Cup Finals.

<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ This is the Stanley Cup Finals.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday was the Stanley Cup Finals with the goalie on
prescription drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Any questions?
</P>
<P>
   Probably not. Game 1 was pretty self-explanatory. Stars goalie
Ed Belfour wasn't feeling good after taking a decongestant
prescribed for his cold symptoms. He didn't play well, allowing six
goals on 18 shots. And without Belfour at his best, the Stars
didn't stand a chance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think what we learned \R Tuesday\S is when Ed Belfour is
average or even below average we are not a very good team, and I
think we need Eddie to be a great player,'' Stars coach Ken
Hitchcock said. ``Our goalie was able to cover up for some of the
mistakes we were making. For one night, he didn't do it.''
</P>
<P>
   And as a result, the Stars fumbled, bumbled and stumbled through
an embarrassing 7-3 loss.
</P>
<P>
   This was the Stars in Game 1. We're about to see the Stars after
a strong dose of humiliation when Game 2 begins at 7 tonight.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's embarrassing for all of us,'' Belfour said. ``It's not
easy for us to put it out of your minds, but it definitely
motivates us.''
</P>
<P>
   Yeah, they have a tendency not only to bounce back, but to
bounce back better after getting humiliated.
</P>
<P>
   Exhibit A: Dallas played abysmally in Game 1 against Colorado,
losing, 2-0, and being outplayed in almost every aspect. In Game 2,
the Stars answered with an angry, physical and mean game and won,
3-2.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hate to lose,'' Stars defenseman Richard Matvichuk said.
``You wake up and say we're not going to let that happen to us
again. We don't ever want to lose two in a row.''
</P>
<P>
   The Stars haven't lost back-to-back games in this year's
playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   A big reason has been Belfour. In Games 3 and 4 against
Colorado, he stopped 76 of 79 shots and helped Dallas escape with a
split.
</P>
<P>
   ``We gave him no support,'' Stars captain Derian Hatcher said.
``We got to help the guy. They had a lot of chances right
point-blank, and that's tough on a goalie. We definitely have to
give him more support than we gave him'' Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars' defense needs to do better against New Jersey's line
of Petr Sykora, Jason Arnott and Patrik Elias. The good news is
that Hatcher, who missed the second half of the third period with a
hyperextended right knee, is healthy and expected to play.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars need to do a better job of counteracting New Jersey's
speed. As Devils winger Claude Lemieux said: ``You can only chop
and hit what you can catch.''
</P>
<P>
   The Stars' offense needs to generate more than one or two good
scoring chances a period.
</P>
<P>
   Mostly, the Stars' goaltender needs the Stars to play better in
front of him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eddie has been there for us all year, and we left him out
there,'' Matvichuk said of Game 1. ``That's what's embarrassing.''
</P>
<P>
   Belfour said he started getting sick before Game 7 against
Colorado and started taking the decongestant. He had taken this
particular prescription medication before without any ill effects.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, when he talked to Hitchcock before Game 1, he wasn't
feeling well.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a thing with Eddie where we kind of communicate with
him earlier in the day, because, really, from noon on, he's not a
guy you really want to talk to,'' Hitchcock said. ``We always ask
him the question `How are you feeling?' And he gives you the answer
`Good,' then we walk away. That is the end of the conversation.''
</P>
<P>
   But a single word dragged into 10 minutes as Belfour explained
that he wasn't feeling all that good.
</P>
<P>
   Hitchcock said he knew there was a possible problem that
afternoon but thought Belfour would be able to get through.
Hitchcock said he realized the situation was ``dicey'' a couple of
shots into Game 1 but decided to stay with Belfour.
</P>
<P>
   Hitchcock quickly dismissed speculation that Belfour had used
his cold as an excuse for his poor play.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like to use things like that as an excuse,'' Belfour
said. ``I didn't play my best game. I know our team didn't play our
best game, and they know it. Regardless, whether I am on medication
or not, I have to play better, and I know that.''
</P>
<P>
   Belfour said he didn't feel energetic at practice yesterday but
hoped to be better this morning. He says he will play tonight. He's
no longer taking the medication, which he said threw off his
balance and equilibrium.
</P>
<P>
   Belfour said that if he had been healthy he would have stopped
at least half of the six goals he allowed, Devils defenseman Scott
Stevens' slap shot, for instance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope it was something, because it wasn't that hard of a
shot,'' Stevens said.
</P>
<P>
   How bad were things for Belfour and the Stars in Game 1?
</P>
<P>
   Devils goalie Martin Brodeur said he felt himself feeling sorry
for Belfour.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, for sure, because you never know when it is going to
happen to you,'' Brodeur said. ``Unfortunately, it happened for
him, but it's fun for us.''
</P>
<P>
   The Stars were forced to sit and watch the celebration. Every
time they looked at the scoreboard, they were reminded of how badly
they were getting beat.
</P>
<P>
   Which might be just what the doctor ordered for the Stars.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes, we need a good kick in the butt to start playing,''
Stars forward Guy Carbonneau said. ``If you look at the game last
night, a lot of those goals were little things we could have done
better _ being outbattled in the corner, just a step behind coming
back in front of the net.''
</P>
<P>
   And did Game 1 provide that kick in the pants?
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope so,'' Carbonneau said. ``This is the Finals.''
</P>
<P>
   Any questions?

<P>
   CHEBAA, Lebanon _ Syria is ready to accept Israel's retreat last
week from southern Lebanon as a complete withdrawal, a United
Nations envoy said Wednesday, perhaps easing concerns that violence
along the Israeli-Lebanese border might resume.
</P>
<P>
   After a meeting in Damascus, the envoy, Terje Roed-Larsen, said
he and Foreign Minister Farouk al-Sharaa of Syria were in ``full
agreement on every matter'' concerning the withdrawal and could
decide soon how to deploy more U.N. peacekeeping troops in southern
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, he added, the Syrians agreed with a U.N. report
issued last week that said that Israel does not have to give up a
contested piece of territory of about 10 square miles at the far
southeastern corner of Lebanon _ land called Chebaa Farms _ in
order to comply with U.N. Resolution 425.
</P>
<P>
   That Security Council resolution dates from the 1982 Israeli
invasion of Lebanon and calls for Israel's withdrawal from land it
occupied at that time.
</P>
<P>
   Most of Chebaa Farms was occupied by Israel in 1967, after its
war with its Arab neighbors, and Israel has argued it is not
covered by Resolution 425.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement from Roed-Larsen suggested that Syria, which
exercises ultimate military and political control over Lebanon, has
decided to avoid a potentially costly escalation in tensions in the
Middle East by not challenging the United Nations over verification
of Israel's withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
   But the reaction in Lebanon was confused. The government and the
armed Hezbollah militia have threatened to continue attacking
Israeli targets if Chebaa Farms is not returned.
</P>
<P>
   Lebanon's prime minister, Selim al-Hoss, issued a statement
saying that he had also talked with Sharaa and was told that Syria
supports Lebanon's claim to Chebaa Farms. The official Syrian news
agency SANA also reported that Sharaa called on Israel to withdraw
from Chebaa Farms, either unilaterally or in accordance with other
U.N. resolutions related to Arab land it occupied in the 1967
Arab-Israeli war.
</P>
<P>
   A Hezbollah spokesman in Beirut said the militia was not ready
to comment on the statement by Roed-Larsen.
</P>
<P>
   The apparent conflict over whether Syria does or does not back
the Lebanese and Hezbollah position is more than a matter of
semantics.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of Hezbollah, the main guerrilla movement in the south,
have said they will not abandon their war until Israel gives up
Chebaa Farms, a mountainous stretch of land at the base of Mount
Hermon in the Golan Heights, and releases all Lebanese held in
Israeli jails.
</P>
<P>
   The Lebanese government, which has permitted the Iranian-backed
Islamic militia to operate freely in the south and has lauded it as
a national liberation force, has echoed the Hezbollah threats.
</P>
<P>
   But at the same time, both the government and Hezbollah are
tightly tied to Syria, which has some 30,000 soldiers and an
undisclosed number of intelligence agents in Lebanon. So a Syrian
decision to accept Israel's withdrawal as full compliance with
Resolution 425 would obligate both Lebanon and the militia to
follow suit.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   That Israel occupies Chebaa Farms, a stretch of land that
overlooks the Golan Heights and South Lebanon, is not in dispute.
The issue is the timing of Israel's occupation. It was seized in
1967, 15 years before the Israeli invasion of Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   As far as the U.N. resolutions are concerned, Chebaa Farms is
part of the land Israel seized from Syria along with the Golan
Heights. Lebanese officials have said they want all their land
restored, regardless of when it was occupied.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. officials, including Roed-Larsen, have said recently that
the ownership of Chebaa Farms is a matter to be decided between
Syria and Lebanon. The two countries have never agreed on an
international border between them.
</P>
<P>
   Chebaa Farms is a rocky mountainous tract along Lebanon's
southeastern border, strategic not only because it provides a view
onto the Golan Heights but also over south Lebanon and the Bekaa
Valley that runs between Syria and Lebanon. Seven small rivers that
feed into the Jordan River before it flows past Israel all converge
in a depression of the Chebaa Farms land.
</P>
<P>
   Before the 1967 war, the land contained a series of family-owned
farms where Lebanese peasants grew wheat and grazed their
livestock. But two weeks after the June 1967 war ended, Chebaa
Farms became a new battleground, its farmers driven from their
fields and homes by Israeli soldiers seeking a vantage point to
watch for incursions by Palestinian militants operating from south
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   Ahmed Ali, now 75, lived through the Israeli invasion. In an
interview in his home in Chebaa, a village perched on the hillside
just west of the farms, Ali said he remembers that he and his
relatives were harvesting their summer wheat when Israeli soldiers
appeared and sprayed the fields with machine-gun fire.
</P>
<P>
   One of Ali's cousins was killed. ``Then they made everyone leave
their homes and they destroyed them,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   His nephew, Yehiya Ali, has been collecting deeds and other
documents from the displaced owners of land in Chebaa Farms for the
past 15 years _ an effort that so annoyed the Israeli occupation
forces in southern Lebanon that they threw him in prison in 1987
for one week.
</P>
<P>
   Ali, who moved from Chebaa to Beirut two years after his
imprisonment and returned home only last week, has now revived his
effort to reclaim his family's land. He said some 10,000 Lebanese
used to live year-round on the land, including his own extended
family, and another 1,000 families farmed plots there but lived in
the town of Chebaa.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know this land is ours and it belongs to Lebanon,'' he said
Wednesday as he spread the documents out on a table in his uncle's
home.

 &HT;    Jackets' rise coincides with ascension of Prince
 &HT;    By Norman Arey
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A year ago, Bryan Prince was a part-time bench-sitter,
part-time designated hitter, full-time rah-rah guy on Georgia
Tech's baseball team.
</P>
<P>
   Prince was willing to do anything to get playing time. He was
hoping for a chance to catch a game or two in relief of starter
Eric McQueen and maybe play a little first base.
</P>
<P>
   After two seasons at Tech, the highly regarded high school
recruit somehow had managed anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Prince is a first team All-ACC catcher, fresh from being
named the MVP in last week's NCAA Atlanta regional. He also is one
of 10 semifinalists for the Johnny Bench Award, presented to the
best catcher in college baseball.
</P>
<P>
   A case can be made that Prince is the player most responsible
for the success of this year's Georgia Tech team, which is just two
victories away from a trip to Omaha for the College World Series.
</P>
<P>
   Third-sacker Mark Teixeira was named first team All-American, is
hitting .422 and has slugged 18 homers. And second baseman Richard
Lewis, a second-team All-American, batted over .400 all season and
has made himself into one of the best leadoff hitters in the
nation.
</P>
<P>
   But Prince is one of the reasons Teixeira has knocked in 80 runs
and has carried a high average all year. The catcher, who bats
clean-up behind Teixeira, is hitting .395 with 77 RBIs and made
teams pay dearly when they chose not to pitch to Teixeira.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were playing FSU, and they decided to pitch around
Teixeira,'' Tech coach Danny Hall said. ``(FSU third baseman)
Marshall McDougall asked me if a lot of people were doing that. I
told him some had, but the next guy in the lineup had made them
sorry a lot of the time. Bryan immediately doubled, and McDougall
said, `I see what you mean.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Prince is allowed to call his own game when ace Cory Vance is
pitching, and the junior left-hander has compiled a 13-2 mark.
</P>
<P>
   He is the epitome of a catcher _ 6 feet 2, 200 pounds, dirty
uniform, scrapes and scratches and scabs everywhere, a candidate
for a Band-Aid commercial.
</P>
<P>
   Catching takes a special mentality, almost a football attitude,
Prince said. ``Absolutely. I think there is a different mindset,
but I love being involved in every pitch of every play. I think I'd
be bored playing anywhere else.''
</P>
<P>
   Friday, Prince was having a hard time getting Tech starter Rhett
Parrott settled down against Georgia Southern. The catcher blocked
at least half a dozen pitches before one bounced up and struck him
in the throat. He went down, got a quick visit from the trainer and
immediately went back to work. ``I'd much rather have the pitches
there than about belt-high out
</P>
<P>
   over the plate,'' he said. ``I don't mind if our pitchers bounce
them up. Just don't throw it down the middle.''
</P>
<P>
   The native of Fort Oglethorpe was recruited by two dozen major
schools and visited Clemson, Tennessee, Georgia and Miami before
choosing Tech. ``This'' _ the NCAA playoffs _ ``is the reason I
came here,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Prince is one of the Jacket tri-captains, with Teixeira and
reserve Jahmal Overton, and is one of the team leaders on and off
the diamond.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's my job to keep our pitchers focused,'' he said. ``If one
of the pitchers is having a problem, I go out there and talk, try
to settle him down. I'll tell him something funny somebody in the
stands said, or say something about one of the umpires or anything
to get his mind off of the problem and to get him to focus on me.
It's my job to keep him focused, not to let him worry about
whatever's happening.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the ultimate team player,'' Hall said. ``This year he has
done everything and anything he could do to help us win. He's a
great defensive catcher, he's a team leader, and he's caught almost
every game and has been beaten up a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Taking punishment comes with the job, Prince said. ``There are
days when you sit in the whirlpool a long time, but winning takes
the pain away,'' he said. ``In the ACC tournament, I caught five
games in four days, but when we won, I didn't feel any pain.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Bryan's done a lot this year,'' Hall said. ``There's no doubt
he's the unsung hero of this team.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ When the Europeans last week offered Israel a
way out of its painful isolation at the United Nations, the move
caused a cheer among Israeli diplomats here and American Jewish
leaders, who campaigned for this prize for a decade.
</P>
<P>
   But decades of slights and assaults have taken a toll on Israeli
confidence in the United Nations, so there was hesitation until
almost the last minute among the Israelis about whether to accept
the offer.
</P>
<P>
   The urgings of European friends and the intercession of
Ambassador Richard C. Holbrooke with Israel's foreign minister,
David Levy, led Israel to take less than it wanted, hoping to get
the rest later.
</P>
<P>
   An important factor, diplomats said, was a determination by
Prime Minister Ehud Barak to put a higher priority on a full role
for Israel in the United Nations, a goal not given much importance
by his predecessor, Benjamin Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
   What was formally offered to Israel last Friday night, and
formally accepted on Tuesday, was temporary membership in a
regional caucus, the Western European and Other Group, known in
United Nations jargon as WEOG. Without membership in a regional
group, a country can never hope to be elected to important councils
and committees in the U.N. system.
</P>
<P>
   Until last week, Israel, a member of the United Nations since
1949, has been barred from the Asian caucus, which includes the
Middle East, since regional groups were organized in the 1960s. It
was the only country banned from any group.
</P>
<P>
   Israel's eventual victory was bittersweet, however. It has been
asked to forgo the chance to hold the most influential seats,
including on the Security Council, at least for the foreseeable
future. And the invitation did not include the right to take part
in European caucuses in Geneva, the United Nations' European
headquarters, or in centers in Vienna and Nairobi.
</P>
<P>
   Geneva is particularly important, Yehuda Lancry, Israel's
ambassador to the United Nations, said in an interview on
Wednesday. The United Nations Human Rights Commission, a perennial
critic of Israel, meets there, and several important U.N. agencies
have their headquarters in Geneva. Of all the concessions Israel
had to make, ``that one constituted a problem for us,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We understand that our membership is on a temporary basis, and
we accept that,'' Lancry said, adding that Israel still has hopes
of entering the Asian bloc when peace efforts succeed in the Middle
East. And, he said, membership gives Israel the ``ability to
express itself among the family of nations, to be able to channel
its creativity, its energy, its spirit.''
</P>
<P>
   Lancry said that he was advised to seize the moment. ``Taking
into consideration that we were out for more than four decades of
the spheres of influence, the opportunity was rare and precious and
the decision had to be made, and we made it.''
</P>
<P>
   Lancry said that he had to counter strong pressures on the
Europeans from Arab and other Islamic nations, whose leaders wanted
Israel's membership in the European group _ which also includes
Canada, New Zealand, Australia and sometimes the United States _
held hostage to Palestinian and other regional demands.
</P>
<P>
   Arab reaction to the move to admit Israel to the European group
has been muted in recent days. At a lunch on Wednesday that
Holbrooke gave for Sen. Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania, three envoys
from Islamic nations congratulated Yancry. Diplomats regard this as
at least a truce.
</P>
<P>
   David Harris, executive director of the American Jewish
Committee, which has led the campaign on behalf of Israel since
1993 through quiet diplomacy at the United Nations and European
capitals said on Sunday that the fight is not over, however.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a major step forward, but no one should engage in
self-deception,'' said Harris, who returned on Wednesday from
Geneva, where he was elected the new head of U.N. Watch, a private
monitoring group.
</P>
<P>
   ``Israel remains still unequal, and the conditions imposed on
Israel reveal that fact.
</P>
<P>
   ``The danger here is that people will conclude that Israel's
problems have been solved totally, when in fact they have not.''
</P>
<P>
   Israel's drive for membership in a regional caucus within the
United Nations and the consequent chance to take part more fully in
the organization's work has been a goal of Israeli governments for
decades. During the cold war, however, Israel became the target of
a General Assembly majority of leftist, Third-World and Islamic
nations.
</P>
<P>
   The nadir of Israel's relations with the organization came in
the mid-1970s, when the General Assembly voted to equate Zionism
with racism, a move that alienated many American intellectuals from
the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   Although the end of the cold war enabled President George Bush
to have the Zionism resolution rescinded by the assembly, a
changing world atmosphere did little to help Israel generally in
the United Nations until very recently, when the Barak government
came to power and accelerated efforts to settle with its neighbors
and the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``The Europeans spent the last decade blaming each other,'' an
American official said on Wednesday. Just when one country would
lift objections to Israeli membership, another would find a reason
to block it. Belgium, Germany and Sweden were Israel's strongest
friends and supporters, while objections came from Ireland, Italy,
Portugal, Spain and sometimes France.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, a breakthrough occurred, diplomats said, when France
_ where Lancry was Israel's ambassador at the time _ swung around
to support of Israel. At the same time, the Clinton administration
began to lobby European leaders at the highest levels, including
King Juan Carlos of Spain, whose country proved to be the last
holdout.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright spoke to European foreign
ministers and at the United Nations Holbrooke began to tackle
envoys.
</P>
<P>
   Then help came from an unexpected quarter. In speeches,
Secretary General Kofi Annan began to call attention to Israel's
isolation in strong terms. In a speech in New York in December,
Annan said that ``it sometimes seems that the United Nations served
all the world's people but one: the Jews.''
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Annan welcomed the European decision, saying that
it ``rectifies a longstanding anomaly.''
</P>
<P>
   But Harris emphasized that it was important that Barak's
government finally decided to give a clear signal to the European
Union. ``At some point, Israel got off the fence,'' he said.
``Until they decided to go for it, it wasn't even clear to many of
the WEOG members whether this was important enough to Israel to
pursue.''
</P>
<P>
   Israel's cold feet did not finally warm until last Monday,
however, diplomats said on Wednesday. Levy, the Israeli foreign
minister, was still concerned that Israel could be making a mistake
by taking only a limited offer. The problem was Geneva.
</P>
<P>
   The United States made one more promise, and added a warning,
diplomats said. If Israel accepted the European offer, the American
ambassador to the United Nations in Geneva would be put to work
immediately to extend Israel's participation there. If the Israelis
faltered now, they were told, a window provided by the Dutch as
chairman of WEOG in New York could close because of some unforeseen
event in the Middle East or Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Two days later, Peter van Walsum, the Dutch ambassador, told his
fellow WEOG members by letter that he was making the offer to
Israel and they had until Friday to object. There were no
objections.

<P>
   Beginning Sunday, and continuing for six weeks, The New York
Times will publish a series of articles, ``How Race Is Lived in
America.''
</P>
<P>
   Two generations after the end of legal discrimination, race
still ignites political debates _ over Civil War flags, for
example, or police profiling. But the wider public discussion of
race relations seems muted by a full-employment economy and by a
sense, particularly among many whites, that the time of large
social remedies is past. Race relations are being defined less by
political action than by daily experience, in schools, in sports
arenas, in pop culture, in churches and, especially, in the
workplace. These encounters _ relations in the most literal,
everyday sense _ make up this series of reports.
</P>
<P>
   The series is the outcome of a yearlong effort by a team of
Times reporters to capture some of the troubling issues that
Americans continue to face and some of the voices of ordinary
people.
</P>
<P>
   These stories, two or three each week, are long, at 6,000 words
and up. They will move on the News Service wire the day before
publication and will carry a slug of the form BC-RACE-SLUG-NYT. In
addition, the News Service will file an abridged version of each
story, approximately half the length of the original.

   Here is a brief description of the first three articles.

   RACE-CHURCH (Decatur, Ga.) _ Nearly 50 years after the Rev. Dr.
Martin Luther King Jr. scolded Christians for making 11 a.m Sunday
the most segregated hour of the week, the Assembly of God
Tabernacle here is the rarest of religious institutions: a truly
integrated church in the heart of the South. And yet, the
Tabernacle is deeply conservative, socially and theologically. What
draws its members is the intensity of their Pentacostal faith,
which teaches that the Holy Spirit can move in the lives of all
believers, regardless of background. By Kevin Sack.

<P>
   RACE-IMMIGRANTS (Miami) _ Before they left Cuba for America in
1994 Joel Ruiz, who is black, and Achmed Valdes, who is white, were
the best of friends. Today, in Miami, the two men live only four
miles apart, not even 15 minutes by car. Yet they are separated by
a far greater distance, one they say they never envisioned back in
Cuba. In ways that are obvious to the black man but far less so to
the white one, they have grown apart in the U.S. because of race.
For the first time, they inhabit a place where the color of their
skin defines the outlines of their lives _ where they live, the
friends they make, how they speak, what they wear, even what they
eat. By Mirta Ojito.

   RACE-MILITARY (Fort Knox, Ky.) _ On a chill December morning,
two soldiers _ one black, one white, both part of an institution
portrayed as a model of race relations _ stood only yards apart in
the middle of this sprawling base, each believing himself the
victim of racism; one because of an award, the other because of a
transfer. The Army is not supposed to harbor racial resentment
anymore. Its work force is integrated. The Army is one of the few
institutions in America in which blacks routinely boss around
whites, and supposedly no one gives it a second thought. But that
is an idealized image. The Pentagon has found that two-thirds of
its men and women had experienced a racially offensive encounter in
the previous 12 months. And those findings are more or less
mirrored here at Fort Knox. By Steven A. Holmes.

   GRANBURY, Texas _ With toothpaste, two toothbrushes and a piece
of wire, a slippery Hood County prisoner completed his own Mission
Impossible by slithering out of his cell, through an air duct and
out of jail, becoming the first to escape the 6-year-old facility.
</P>
<P>
   Police identified the escapee Wednesday as burglary suspect
Collin Michael Littrell, 25, of Granbury who has been on the run
since early Friday.
</P>
<P>
   So far, he has eluded bloodhounds, tracking teams, a roadblock
and a helicopter, the sheriff's office said.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, a man matching Littrell's description was seen
stealing a blue minivan in the Erath County town of Dublin, 60
miles to the southwest.
</P>
<P>
   The lanky prisoner, who was awaiting trial on eight burglary
charges, apparently yanked a piece of wire from an air duct in his
cell. Stringing it between two toothbrushes, he fashioned a
makeshift hacksaw and, slowly and patiently, he sawed for weeks at
a white bar blocking the duct entrance, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   After sawing for hours each day, Littrell apparently used white
toothpaste to mask the groove in the metal, sheriff's investigator
Larry Goin said.
</P>
<P>
   An alert jail employee noticed that the steel bar had been
tampered with about two weeks ago, Hood County Sheriff Allen Hardin
said. A work order was issued but not acted upon, and neither
Littrell nor any of his 14 cellmates was moved to another cell.
</P>
<P>
   ``They didn't consider someone going through an exhaust fan,
unless they're just a plain idiot,'' Goin said of the jail staff.
</P>
<P>
   Sometime early Friday, Littrell finished cutting through the
white bar. Possibly with help from one or more cellmates, he lifted
his 5-foot-9-inch, 145-pound frame into the air duct, Hardin said.
</P>
<P>
   In his bunk, Littrell left behind a dummy; a water-filled trash
bag inside a laundry sack formed the head and two pillows formed
the body, officers said.
</P>
<P>
   As Littrell wriggled through the duct, he had to remove a
chain-link barrier and slip between the large but unmoving blades
of a fan, police said. Then he had to force open a door to the
roof.
</P>
<P>
   No one else escaped, but deputies are investigating the
possibility that his cellmates were involved.
</P>
<P>
   Once free, Littrell stole a car from an unincorporated area of
Hood County near Strouds Creek, about two miles north of the jail.
He then drove to the Brazos River Acres subdivision, about six
miles to the south, to see his infant daughter, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   The mother of his child, a former girlfriend, called the
Sheriff's Department about 4 a.m. Friday to find out why Littrell
was free and at her front door.
</P>
<P>
   ``And that was the first we knew he was out,'' Goin said.
</P>
<P>
   The escapee abandoned the car, apparently because he could not
get it started again without a key, Goin said. Some of his
belongings were recovered.
</P>
<P>
   For days, neither a roadblock, bloodhounds, a helicopter nor
tracking teams turned up anything else.
</P>
<P>
   About 4:30 a.m. Wednesday, a blue Plymouth Voyager minivan with
license plate DBK41F was stolen in Dublin, Texas. Witnesses'
descriptions closely match Littrell's, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Because Littrell is said to have carried firearms during some
burglaries, Goin described him as potentially dangerous. Littrell
has brown eyes and brown hair, with the top bleached blond. He has
used the alias Mika V. Finch, according to authorities.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from the eight burglary charges in Hood County, Littrell
has ``at least that many pending'' in Parker and Erath counties,
said Hood County District Attorney Richard Hattox.
</P>
<P>
   Littrell was on parole after a 1993 Denton County forgery
conviction when he was arrested Jan. 28 after an investigation by
Hood, Parker and Erath county deputies, according to Hattox and
state records.
</P>
<P>
   Deputies from the three counties had been keeping his house
under surveillance after receiving a tip that tied Littrell to a
motor vehicle theft in Parker County, Hattox said.
</P>
<P>
   While watching his home, deputies heard a radio call describing
an Erath burglary. Littrell then drove up in a car matching the
description of the auto used in the break-in, and deputies arrested
him, the district attorney said.
</P>
<P>
   As for the breakout worthy of a TV adventure series, the sheriff
said it could have been prevented if his staff had replaced the
half-sawed bar in time. ``If maintenance had been doing its job, it
wouldn't have happened,'' Hardin said.

POLITICAL MEMO: THIS FEELS LIKE '88, GOOD NEWS (MAYBE) FOR GORE 
</HEADLINE>
  By ROBIN TONER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The ghost of the 1988 election is a comforting
spirit to many Democrats, who like to remember another sitting vice
president, George Bush, who was trailing in the polls in May only
to prevail, handily, in November.
</P>
<P>
   In the eyes of these Democrats and some leading scholars, the
message of 1988 is clear. Vice presidents seeking election in their
own right take time to emerge; not until the convention do they
truly take their place in the public's mind as the leader of their
party.
</P>
<P>
   And when voters finally pay attention to the race, broader
issues become most important: How good is the economy, how stable
is the world and, essentially, do they want a third term of the
party in power?
</P>
<P>
   If the '88 paradigm holds, Vice President Al Gore is stronger
than he looks, and his present difficulties in the polls are much
exaggerated _ particularly given the stronger economy of 2000.
Citing both the extraordinary economy and President Clinton's
approval ratings, Thomas E. Mann, a senior fellow at the Brookings
Institution, a research group, said, ``It will be a first in modern
American history if an incumbent administration is deposed from
office under these conditions.''
</P>
<P>
   But veterans of the 1988 campaigns of Vice President Bush, the
Republican, and Gov. Michael S. Dukakis of Massachusetts, the
Democrat, say there are also important differences between the two
elections _ from the background of the challengers to the tenor of
the times.
</P>
<P>
   And Mann and other analysts agree that there is a complicated
variable that may be masked by this administration's high approval
ratings: How will the long ordeal of scandal and impeachment affect
the voters' desire to stay the course?
</P>
<P>
   Bob Teeter, a pollster and top strategist for Vice President
Bush's 1988 campaign, argued: ``Even in a good economy, Gore is
vice president of an administration that people don't like very
well. They like its performance and its policies, but they don't
like what's been dragged before them.''
</P>
<P>
   For all of that, the parallels with 1988 are striking. Then, and
now, the incumbent vice president was struggling to emerge from the
shadow of a two-term president presiding over a peaceful,
prosperous nation. Then, and now, the vice president secured his
party's nomination only to lag, persistently, in the polls behind a
fresh-faced governor declaring it was time for a change. Then, and
now, the vice president's campaign tried methodically to redefine
that governor as untested and risky.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Times/CBS News poll ratings for May 1988 and May
2000 are eerily similar for the candidates. Vice President Bush, 12
years ago, was viewed favorably by 33 percent, unfavorably by 35
percent. Vice President Gore, earlier this month, was viewed
favorably by 34 percent, unfavorably by 36 percent. Dukakis was _
at least by this measure _ in better shape than Gov. George W. Bush
is today. Thirty-eight percent viewed him favorably, 14 percent
unfavorably; earlier this month, 40 percent viewed Governor Bush
favorably, 28 percent unfavorably.
</P>
<P>
   But the Dukakis support proved exceedingly soft. In May 1988, in
a moment that lives on in campaign folklore, the Bush campaign team
took some of the most controversial elements of the Dukakis record
in Massachusetts and tested them with a focus group of voters in
Paramus, N.J. They emerged with the makings of a devastating
attack.
</P>
<P>
   A Gore adviser said of the Bush strategists of 1988: ``One of
the critical insights they had, when they dissected Dukakis in '88,
was that it was no one single issue that proved decisive. When they
did those focus groups in Paramus, N.J., it was the accumulation of
negatives'' that ultimately swayed the voters.
</P>
<P>
   But veterans of that campaign say that Governor Bush will be
harder to redefine, by virtue of his family name and history. `I
don't think you can make a Wasp governor from Texas as much of a
stranger to the American public as a Greek-American liberal'' from
Massachusetts, said Jack Corrigan, director of operations for the
Dukakis campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, some campaign veterans say, the younger Bush and his
strategists have clearly learned lessons from 1988, and have
quickly moved to advance Bush's biography, themes and policy
proposals for the fall campaign; he will not be the tabula rasa
Dukakis was.
</P>
<P>
   Dukakis ``didn't have a clue as to how wedge issues play out in
a general election campaign,'' said Richard Bond, the national
political director for the elder Bush's 1988 campaign. As a result,
Bond added, Dukakis underestimated the power of issues like the
Massachusetts prison program that gave furloughs to convicted
murderers like Willie Horton, which was used against the Democrats
to extraordinary effect. ``Who thinks that Gore will ever be able
to do that to Bush Jr.?'' Bond asked.
</P>
<P>
   Others see it as less far-fetched. Geoffrey Garin, a Democratic
pollster, said, ``When Governor Bush has come under scrutiny in the
primary period, he has not stood up very well. And it's clear that
the Gore campaign will do its best to take a page out of Vice
President Bush's treatment of Dukakis.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the Gore campaign has been using a set of potential
wedge issues against Bush, including his support for laws allowing
licensed Texans to carry concealed weapons, even in church.
</P>
<P>
   Another line of attack in 1988 was Vice President Bush's success
in presenting himself as the only credible commander in chief _
aided and abetted by Dukakis' uncomfortable outing in a tank, an
image used repeatedly in Republican advertising. But during the
Cold War, voters were much more sensitive to a candidate's
qualifications to be commander in chief, particularly governors
with no foreign policy experience. Today, such factors are much
further down the voters' agenda, Teeter said _ and thus less of a
hurdle for Governor Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there are deeper similarities to 1988, some analysts say,
notably what is sometimes called the shadow theory: How hard a vice
president's transition is from helpmate to leader in his own right.
</P>
<P>
   ``Vice Presidents in the modern American political context have
either won the election, like George Bush Sr., or they came
amazingly close,'' like Richard M. Nixon in 1960, , said George
Sirgiovanni, professor of history at the College of St. Elizabeth
in Morristown, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   For a vice president to prevail in November, there is an artful
process of baton-passing that needs to occur, strategists say, in
which vice presidents both separate from the departing president
and benefit from his legacy.
</P>
<P>
   President Ronald Reagan was, in spring 1988, still recovering
from the Iran-contra scandal. His approval rating in May was not a
match for Clinton's today, which has remained above 55 percent
throughout his second term. But as Reagan's final year played out,
his ratings climbed, as did the general good feelings about the
times.
</P>
<P>
   Bush both benefited from Reagan's aura and, at the Republican
convention, memorably asked and answered the question of who should
replace the president, saying, ``I am that man.''
</P>
<P>
   Dukakis, who watched his 10-point lead in May 1988 melt away,
reflected: ``I think it takes a while for a vice president to come
into his own. That certainly happened with Bush, and I think it's
going to happen with Gore.''

DALLAS: gets evaluated
<TEXT>
<P>
   Unlike past death penalty cases, where Bush waited until all
appeals has been exhausted before indicating how he was leaning, he
made his comments Wednesday ahead of an anticipated court ruling in
the case.
</P>
<P>
   Bush aides said Wednesday that they did recognize that this case
was one of the more attention-getting death penalty cases, but they
insisted that such factors have no bearing on how Bush acts or on
what he says. Yet the case also affords Bush a chance to speak in a
moderate voice on the death penalty without seeming to pander,
because the case involves some understandable questions of evidence
that have drawn national attention.
</P>
<P>
   One aide noted that this case, like that of Henry Lee Lucas,
involves a question of evidence, and the aide suggested that Bush
finds this sort of factor more relevant and compelling than
sentimental, emotional factors such as those involved with the
decision not to grant a reprieve to Karla Faye Tucker. In other
words, this case, like that of Lucas, has questions that go
directly to the matter of guilt, not of contrition.
</P>
<P>
   Tucker, a born-again Christian who said she had repented for her
crimes and whose case drew pleas from religious leaders, was
executed in 1998. Bush commuted Lucas' sentence to life in prison
in 1998, following a recommendation by the state pardons board,
after serious questions were raised about whether Lucas committed
the murder he was convicted of.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's embrace of DNA testing for death row inmates, which he
never advocated in Texas, comes as some parts of the nation have
seen a rethinking of capital punishment amid concerns about the
execution of innocent prisoners and polls that indicate support for
the death penalty is at a 20-year low, although most Americans
still favor it.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, Illinois Gov. George Ryan, a Republican,
imposed a moratorium on capital punishment there after the
exoneration of 13 men on death row, and he said last month that
executions will not resume until he has a ``100 percent guarantee''
that no innocent person will face the death penalty again. Across
the nation, bills have been introduced in a dozen states to halt
executions. And in New Hampshire, state lawmakers in May became the
first to vote to abolish the death penalty since the Supreme Court
allowed executions to resume in 1976. The New Hampshire governor,
Jeanne Shaheen, a Democrat, has vetoed the measure.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to its appeal before the federal appeals court,
McGinn's defense team, which includes Barry Scheck, the DNA expert
and New York lawyer who helped defend O.J. Simpson, has filed a
civil lawsuit in Texas to obtain the hair and semen samples taken
from the victim's body so they can be retested.
</P>
<P>
   Should DNA tests indicate that the hair and semen did not come
from McGinn, that would ``raise doubts about whether he could have
committed the whole crime,'' said Scheck, who added that he has
``no idea'' about the guilt or innocence of McGinn. Only two
states, New York and Illinois, allow condemned prisoners to get new
DNA tests of evidence in their cases, and Scheck said Congress
should pass a bill making that standard across the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Lee Haney, who prosecuted the murder case in 1993, said ``as far
as humanly possible'' he is convinced of McGinn's guilt. If new DNA
tests indicated the hair and semen were not from McGinn, he said,
``It would obviously lead to the conclusion that someone else was
involved in the sexual assault in addition to McGinn, but it would
not affect other evidence in case that very clearly ties him to the
murder.'' That includes blood from the victim in McGinn's car and
on his clothes, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Questions have also been raised about the adequacy of some of
McGinn's legal representation. A defense team investigator in the
case, Tina Church, told the Dallas Morning News that McGinn's
appellate lawyer, Richard Alley, did not know about the
inconclusive DNA tests until a few months ago, when she brought
them to his attention. `He should have known about the tests,'
Church told the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Alley, of Fort Worth, Texas, has twice been publicly reprimanded
by the State Bar of Texas _ once in 1985, the other time in 1992 _
and there are two private complaints pending against him, according
to state bar officials. Alley said neither pending complaint
concerns the McGinn case, and he said he would have liked to have
brought the motion for DNA retesting more quickly, but that it took
time to obtain the necessary affidavit from a scientific expert.

CLINTON AND EUROPEAN OFFICIALS MAKE NO PROGRESS IN TRADE TALKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (subs 22nd graf for clarification on Airbus)   
 By ELAINE SCIOLINO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LISBON, Portugal _ President Clinton and senior European Union
officials met Wednesday on four major trade disputes dividing them
but did not make any progress, a senior administration official
said .
</P>
<P>
   The trade issues were apparently so difficult that Clinton,
Romano Prodi, president of the Union Commission, and Prime Minister
Antonio Guterres of Portugal, who currently holds the rotating
European Union presidency, did not even make a serious attempt to
resolve them.
</P>
<P>
   They spent 20 minutes of their 75-minute working meeting at the
Queluz Palace, an 18th century small-scale version of Versailles
outside of Lisbon, on trade. The rest was devoted to Russia and
security issues like Kosovo and European defense. Their hour-long
working lunch focused on economic issues like commerce on the
Internet and infectious diseases.
</P>
<P>
   In an unusually blunt public assessment for such a high-level
meeting, Lael Brainard, the deputy national economic adviser, made
no effort to put a positive spin on it.
</P>
<P>
   Briefing reporters, she described the trade talks as ``a lively
and frank exchange on areas where our views differ.'' Asked
specifically whether any progress had been made on any outstanding
issues, Brainard said, ``There was no progress at this meeting.''
Wednesday's meetings, on the first stop of Clinton's last scheduled
trip to Europe as president, underscored how little time Clinton
has to shape foreign policy before he leaves office in eight
months.
</P>
<P>
   A joint news conference was held in the formal garden of the
palace after the meetings.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In his opening remarks, Clinton struck a retrospective note,
saying he wanted to put Wednesday's meeting into ``some historical
perspective.'' He listed what he called Europe's achievements in
promoting democracy and economic prosperity during the past eight
years. ``I thank all of those who have supported those
developments,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   In emotional words of his own, the effusive Prodi said that he
wanted to ``pay tribute'' to Clinton's support of the European
Union during his administration. Italy's former prime minister said
it was fitting that Clinton would receive the Charlemagne Prize
later this week, an award given to those who promote Europe's
goals. Clinton is ``a European,'' Prodi said, adding, ``You belong
to our family, really.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it was the blinding sun in Clinton's eyes that made him
blink as Prodi spoke. In the afternoon, Clinton played golf for
several hours with his national security adviser, Sandy Berger, on
a world-class golf course just outside of Lisbon.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In the news conference, Clinton spent most of his time fielding
questions on subjects other than trade.
</P>
<P>
   In his most extensive remarks on the withdrawal of Israeli
troops from Lebanon, Clinton called the withdrawal decision by
Prime Minister Ehud Barak of Israel ``daring.'' He added, ``It
changed the landscape.'' But Clinton also warned that the
withdrawal ``imposes a much greater sense of urgency'' on all the
parties to agree to a blueprint that is supposed to lead to a
permanent peace agreement by mid-September. Israel and the
Palestinians are still grappling with unresolved issues like the
fate of Jerusalem, Jewish settlements on occupied land, borders and
the future of around 4 million Palestinian refugees.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is both greater potential for something happening and
also greater tension in the atmosphere,'' Clinton said, ``which is
causing a ripple effect in the relationship between the Israelis
and the Palestinians.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton confirmed that a private meeting he will have with
Barak, originally scheduled for Berlin, had been switched to Lisbon
on Thursday morning at the request of Barak, who, in the face of
domestic opposition, decided he needed to be in the country for a
state ceremony marking Jerusalem Unification Day.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who is scheduled to leave for Germany later on
Thursday, also spoke by telephone with the Palestinian leader,
Yasser Arafat. ``President Clinton emphasized a commitment to do
everything he can to move the process forward,'' a senior
administration official said.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Asked at the news conference about a U.S. plan to develop a
limited missile defense, which has been much criticized by
America's European partners, Clinton reiterated his view that the
United States faces a new nuclear threat and would be willing to
share its technology with other ``civilized nations.''
</P>
<P>
   If the technology for such a system is developed, Clinton said,
``it would be unethical,'' for the United States to hoard the
technology.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's proposal to modify the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile
Treaty to allow for the deployment of a limited missile defense
system as well as Russia's conduct in the war in Chechnya will be
at the top of the agenda when he meets during the weekend in Moscow
with Russia's president, Vladimir Putin, for the first time. Putin
has vociferously opposed amending the treaty, a landmark of cold
war arms control.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've done a lot of information sharing already with the
Russians,'' Clinton said. ``We've offered to do more.''
</P>
<P>
   The Europeans are not sanguine about a modification of the
treaty either.
</P>
<P>
   Guterres, Portugal's prime minister, said Wednesday that any
move toward a missile-defense system would have to be agreed to
``by everybody'' and would have to take into account ``everyone's
preoccupations in this matter.''
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, President Jacques Chirac of France said he was
worried that the missile defense system would spark a new global
arms race.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton played down the prospects for any major breakthrough in
Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would be surprised if we bridge all of our differences on
Chechnya, and I would be surprised if we resolved all our
differences on the question of missile defense, although we might
make more headway than most people expect,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As for trade, trade between the United States and the 15-member
European Union represents more than 40 percent of the world's
share, but the two sides are locked in a protracted and public
struggle over a series of conflicts in which neither side has shown
much willingness to compromise.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. side objects to European restrictions on the
importation of bananas, a ban on U.S. beef produced with growth
hormones and subsidizing by European governments of a new
double-deck passenger jet built by the European consortium Airbus
Industrie.
</P>
<P>
   More recently, the European Union has objected to a tax break
that the United States grants to major corporations that set up
operations in offshore tax havens like the Virgin Islands and
Barbados. These companies are not required to pay U.S. sales tax
and duties _ from 10 to 30 percent _ on their exports. The European
Union argues that the tax relief that benefits 6,000 exporters,
including such corporate giants as Boeing, General Motors and
Microsoft is a form of subsidy that will amount to about $25
billion to U.S. companies during the next five years.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the European Union's position on bananas and beef,
the World Trade Organization has allowed the United States to
impose more than $300 million in import penalties against the
European Union. The Europeans are infuriated by the U.S.
retaliatory import tax on goods such as Roquefort cheese and foie
gras.

MRS.CLINTON PLEDGES A RACE OF `ISSUES NOT INSULTS'
</HEADLINE>
 By JONATHAN P. HICKS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ With her Republican opponent now confirmed, Hillary
Rodham Clinton took an aggressively combative tone on Wednesday,
criticizing Rep. Rick Lazio for operating what she said was a
campaign based on insults and asserting that her positions better
reflected the views of mainstream New Yorkers.
</P>
<P>
   ``While my opponent tells you where he's from, I'm going to tell
you what I'm for,'' Clinton told about 300 supporters at a noon
rally at the lower Manhattan headquarters of the United Brotherhood
of Carpenters and Joiners of America. ``This is not about who's
from New York. This is about who will fight the right fights for
all New Yorkers.''
</P>
<P>
   The rally was held one day after the Republican Party officially
nominated Lazio at its convention in Buffalo, where speakers
criticized Clinton's decision to move to New York and to run for
the U.S. Senate seat being vacated by Daniel Patrick Moynihan.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the Republicans extolled Lazio as a
born-and-bred product of the state and a candidate with moderate
positions on issues. Indeed, the Republican candidate himself
suggested in his acceptance speech that Clinton was at a
disadvantage because she was not a native New Yorker.
</P>
<P>
   ``My opponent may be new,'' Clinton told those at Wednesday's
rally, ``but the issues that New Yorkers care about remain the
same. And the issues I care about remain the same. I pledge to run
a campaign based on issues, not insults, and about the real
differences between us.
</P>
<P>
   ``For 30 years, I have fought for children and families, for
women and workers,'' Clinton told the audience of union workers and
political activists. ``And in this campaign, I've stood up for New
Yorkers who needed a voice. I'm not afraid of the tough fights.''
</P>
<P>
   She then discussed several issues that have become common themes
in her speeches: her support for mandatory handgun registration and
targeted tax cuts, such as tax deductions for college tuition, and
the need to modernize New York's school buildings.
</P>
<P>
   As she has since Lazio emerged as the likely Republican
candidate in place of Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, Clinton
highlighted her support of handgun registration, a position on
which she differs with Lazio.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every teen-ager who wants to drive a car has to get a license
and register their car,'' she said. ``I think it's time we license
every handgun owner and register every new handgun.''
</P>
<P>
   Lazio's aides said that the congressman favors many forms of gun
control, but not registration.
</P>
<P>
   Following the rally, Clinton flew to Buffalo, the city where
Lazio was nominated just 24 hours earlier, to visit a school and to
emphasize her support for a bill in Congress to defray the interest
on school construction bonds.

BUSH FAVORS DELAYING INMATE'S EXECUTION FOR DNA TEST 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOHN W. GONZALEZ 
and EVAN MOORE 
c.2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ In a case involving DNA evidence, Gov. George W.
Bush said Wednesday he would delay an inmate's execution Thursday
if the courts don't step in to block it.
</P>
<P>
   The 30-day reprieve, which only the governor can issue, would be
Bush's first during his five years in office.
</P>
<P>
   And, in a second case involving DNA evidence, Bush on Wednesday
issued a rare pardon to a Tyler man who served 17 years in prison
for a rape that DNA testing proved he did not commit.
</P>
<P>
   A reprieve would allow sophisticated new DNA tests on crucial
evidence in the 1993 rape and murder case of Ricky Nolen McGinn of
Brown County. With Bush and Lt. Gov. Rick Perry out of state
Thursday, the relief for McGinn could only be issued by the acting
governor, state Sen. Rodney Ellis, D-Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said his staff informed Ellis that if other last-minute
legal appeals don't stall the execution, the governor expects Ellis
to carry out his wishes. A final petition is pending in the 5th
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they (courts) don't cause the DNA to be reviewed, I'm more
than likely to grant the 30-day reprieve,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's pardon for 46-year-old A.B. Butler came three weeks after
the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles recommended it. Butler was
convicted of the kidnapping and rape of a 25-year-old woman in 1983
and given two, concurrent 99-year sentences.
</P>
<P>
   Butler is the third Texas convict to be freed as a result of DNA
findings. The other two also went to inmates exonerated by DNA
testing. Kevin Byrd of Houston spent 12 years in prison before
being freed in 1997. Ben Salazar of Austin was freed while serving
a 30-year sentence for a 1992 rape.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has issued 15 pardons since he took office in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Butler began seeking a DNA comparison in 1987 and eventually
contacted Houston attorney Randy Schaffer, who obtained court
orders for the tests.
</P>
<P>
   Schaffer had one test conducted that proved inconclusive. A
second test, however, showed Butler was not the rapist and Schaffer
began requesting a hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Schaffer eventually was granted a hearing on that test by state
District Judge Cynthia Kent and, on Jan. 7, Butler was released on
bail.
</P>
<P>
   Both Schaffer and Smith County District Attorney Jack Skeen
joined in requesting a pardon.
</P>
<P>
   Kent, however, ordered a new trial. Schaffer said Wednesday's
pardon negates that order.
</P>
<P>
   Bush agreed to the pardon because the case met his requirement
that such test results be reviewed by the prosecution, defense
attorneys, trial judge and the court of criminal appeals and all
agree that the test constitutes valid new evidence of innocence.
</P>
<P>
   The pardon makes Butler eligible for $25,000 from a state fund
in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, in New Mexico campaigning for the Republican presidential
nomination, issued a statement saying ``all the parties concluded
that the test results constituted new, valid evidence of Mr.
Butler's innocence when reviewed in context with other evidence in
the case.''
</P>
<P>
   In comments recorded for MSNBC-TV's ``Hardball'' program, Bush
said the DNA retesting in McGinn's case was unlikely to offset
evidence that he committed the murder, though it might prove he
didn't rape the victim, Stephanie Rae Flanary, his 12-year-old
stepdaughter. If exonerated of the rape, McGinn would not be
executed but would remain behind bars for murder, Bush noted.
</P>
<P>
   ``My attitude is, if there's any doubt, we ought to be looking
at that evidence. If there's any doubt as to whether or not he
committed the rape, that evidence ought to be reviewed,'' Bush
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll see what the courts say and see what the Board of
Pardons and Paroles says. And then I'll make up my mind,'' Bush
said. ``I want to make sure the man has his full day in court.''
</P>
<P>
   While Bush made those comments, the parole board voted
overwhelmingly against McGinn's requests for a 30-day reprieve and
commutation of his death sentence. Parole board chairman Gerald
Garrett said the board voted 18-0 against recommending to Bush that
he commute the death sentence to a lesser penalty. They split 11-7
against the reprieve, Garrett said.
</P>
<P>
   ``None of the members had any doubt as to his guilt. The facts
that are before us at this time clearly indicate that he's
guilty,'' Garrett said. He was referring to blood and hair evidence
that prosecution experts said tied McGinn to the slaying.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. McGinn and his supporters, at the 11th hour, introduced a
new issue and I believe the membership took a close look at that,''
Garrett said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The board has rendered its decision on this matter, so that
leaves the governor only the option of granting a one-time, 30-day
reprieve,'' Garrett noted.
</P>
<P>
   If Ellis grants the reprieve that Bush favors, McGinn can prove
or disprove his culpability in the rape and murder, one of his
lawyers said. Specifically, the defense teams want to conduct new
types of tests on semen stains found on the victim's clothes and on
a pubic hair _ previously identified as probably from McGinn _
found on the girl's body.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney Barry Scheck, the DNA expert who defended O.J. Simpson,
derided as ``junk science'' the microscopic hair comparisons
conducted on the pubic hair. He said Bush should grant the reprieve
as ``a matter of common sense and basic decency.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see how anybody could oppose this. Not only could we
prevent the execution of somebody who might be innocent, but it
could also lead to the apprehension of the real perpetrator,''
Scheck said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Out of the 72 post-conviction DNA exonerations in North
America, 16 times it has led to the identification of the real
perpetrator, and that's going to happen more and more with these
DNA databases,'' Scheck said.
</P>
<P>
   But on Fox News, McGinn's prosecutor said further DNA testing is
unnecessary and wasn't sought on a timely basis.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point, unlike before the trial, Mr. McGinn is not
presumed to be innocent but is in fact presumed to be guilty
because that's what a jury found,'' said Brown County District
Attorney Lee Haney of Brownwood.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even this evidence would not overcome the tremendous amount of
other evidence that was involved at the trial. ... There's DNA
evidence, scientific evidence and circumstantial evidence tying him
to the murder of this young girl,'' Haney said.

DAVENPORT IS OUSTED AS VAN ROOST PREVAILS 
</HEADLINE>
  By CHRISTOPHER CLAREY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ ``Usually, I cry when I lose,'' Dominique Van Roost said
through tears on her 27th birthday after beating Lindsay Davenport.
</P>
<P>
   It was a day for the unusual at the French Open. A day when a
record 80 singles matches had to be crammed into the schedule at
Roland Garros stadium to make up for the rain that washed out play
completely on Tuesday. A day when the former clay-court masters
Carlos Moya and Marcelo Rios were sent skidding out of the
tournament in the first round. A day, above all, when Davenport,
one of the two women who have dominated the game in 2000, was
beaten by the unseeded but hardly unmotivated Van Roost, 6-7 (5),
6-4, 6-3.
</P>
<P>
   Davenport had not lost her opening match at a Grand Slam event
since 1993, and she had a valid excuse in the injured back that
forced her to withdraw from the Italian Open two weeks ago and
began bothering her significantly again late in the second set
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really wanted to play here, and I gave it my best effort,''
Davenport said. ``You know that's bad timing and bad luck.''
</P>
<P>
   It was left to others to reinforce some order on the day. Venus
Williams, who missed the first four months of the season with
tendinitis in both wrists, fared better Wednesday, beating Jana
Kandarr of Germany, 6-0, 6-3. The defending men's champion Andre
Agassi also advanced, shrugging off three set points in his
first-round match against the Frenchman Anthony Dupuis, winning by
7-6 (7), 6-3, 6-4. In the second round, Yevgeny Kafelnikov downed
the Argentine Mariano Zabaleta, 6-2, 3-6, 6-7 (8), 6-4, 6-4;
Michael Chang defeated Thomas Johansson in four sets to earn a date
with Gustavo Kuerten, and Mark Philippoussis, who beat Pete Sampras
in four sets on Monday, eliminated the American Paul Goldstein.
</P>
<P>
   The second-seeded Davenport was gracious in defeat, conceding
that Van Roost's spirited baseline play had a great deal to do with
the outcome. ``It's a tough call to make about retiring or trying
to play through it,'' said Davenport, who cannot recall retiring
from any match. ``She was playing well. I could have been a hundred
percent healthy and still lost. You never know.''
</P>
<P>
   One month ago, Van Roost, distraught by the death of her mother,
Louise Anne, from cancer on March 26, was not sure she wanted to
play the game anymore. ``I was mentally struggling,'' she said. ``I
had many questions going through my mind.''
</P>
<P>
   A former member of the top 10, her ranking dropped to 20 after
early losses in Rome and Strasbourg, and her draw in Paris did not
lift her spirits. ``I arrived here and said, `Well, God is not
really nice with me in this moment,''' Van Roost said.
</P>
<P>
   But Van Roost's confidence and game plan began to evolve. Like
Davenport, she does not particularly enjoy playing on clay, but she
knew that if she could get enough first serves in play and keep the
Californian off balance by mixing flat, deep groundstrokes with
drop shots she had a chance. By the time the match reached its
critical phase, with Davenport moving gingerly and wincing on most
shots, Van Roost's chances had grown immensely.
</P>
<P>
   Not that the slender Belgian was in perfect shape herself. She
received treatment for cramps in her right forearm and legs three
times in the final set. ``I must admit that I could see she was not
moving all that well, but I was not moving very well at the end
either,'' Van Roost said.

THOMAS SKUTT, MUTUAL OF OMAHA CHIEF, DIES AT 69  

</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Neb., Conn.)   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Thomas J. Skutt, a retired chairman of the Mutual of Omaha
Companies, died on Monday at Methodist Hospital in Omaha. He was 69
and lived in Omaha.
</P>
<P>
   He suffered a cerebral hemorrhage, said Jim Nolan, a spokesman
for Mutual of Omaha, the big insurance company.
</P>
<P>
   Skutt, who joined Mutual of Omaha in 1969 as secretary and tax
counsel, was its chief executive from 1984 to 1986 and its chairman
from 1986 until he retired in 1998. In both posts he succeeded his
father, Vestor Joseph Skutt, known as V.J., who died in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Under Thomas J. Skutt's leadership, Mutual of Omaha diversified
its product offerings and entered additional markets.
</P>
<P>
   Skutt was born in Omaha, grew up there and received a bachelor's
degree in 1952 from Yale. He was an Army lieutenant in Korea in the
early 1950s and received a law degree in 1957 from Creighton
University in Omaha.
</P>
<P>
   He was also a civic leader in Omaha.
</P>
<P>
   Survivors include his wife of 44 years, the former Jeanne
Cecille Plunkett; two daughters, Kimberly Davis and Mary Elizabeth
Sutton, known as Lissa, both of Omaha; a son, Thomas, Jr., also of
Omaha; eight grandchildren; and a sister, Sally Skutt of Lincoln,
Neb.

   HANFORD-REACH (Seattle) _ Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt,
citing the need to preserve natural landscapes of America's West,
recommended creation of a 200,000-acre Hanford Reach National
Monument on the last undammed stretch of the Columbia River. The
stretch of river in Eastern Washington was one of four national
monument proposals that include the Anasazi Indian ruins in
Colorado, Soda Mountain in south-central Oregon, and a mountainous
area of Arizona's Sonoran Desert near Tucson.

 EXCITEATHOME OFFERS PREFERENTIAL WEB TREATMENT  &HT;     By TODD WALLACK 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ ExciteAtHome, the Redwood City, Calif., firm
best known for providing zippy Internet access over cable
television lines, has come up with a new way to boost revenue: give
some Web site operators preferred access to its network so that
those sites seem even faster to its 1.5 million cable modem users.
</P>
<P>
   Executive Vice President Mark O'Leary predicted the new business
would be worth in the ``double-digit millions of dollars'' next
year and grow at between 400 to 600 percent per year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be the fastest-growing part of our commercial
business,'' O'Leary said.
</P>
<P>
   As part of that strategy, ExciteAtHome said Wednesday that it
has signed pacts with three so-called ``content distribution
networks'' (Akamai, iBeam and Microcast), which all help Web sites
zip information faster over the Internet. Akamai distributes
multiple copies of Web sites around the world, iBeam uses
satellites and Microcast has deals to locate its equipment closer
to telecommunications companies.
</P>
<P>
   In April, ExciteAtHome also announced plans to work with
Equinix, which is building dozens of fortified bunkers for
companies to exchange Internet traffic so other Internet companies
can more easily tie into ExciteAtHome's network.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, ExciteAtHome reaches only a tiny fraction of
Internet users. America Online, for instance, has 22 million
customers.
</P>
<P>
   O'Leary, the ExciteAtHome executive who is spearheading the
strategy, said Web operators are especially eager to reach
ExciteAtHome's users because they all have fast Internet
connections, and are more likely to try to watch movies and
download songs and other bandwidth-intensive tasks. ExciteAtHome is
the Internet service provider for a majority of U.S. homes with
high-speed access, typically dozens of times faster than a
conventional 56K modem.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a real compelling value here,'' O'Leary said.
</P>
<P>
   ExciteAtHome could potentially work directly with some major Web
sites, like Yahoo's Broadcast.com. But yesterday's deal shows that
it is first interested in working through middlemen, such as Web
hosting companies, Internet service providers and companies like
Akamai that specialize in working with Web sites to reduce lag
time.
</P>
<P>
   Akamai makes copies of popular Web pages on sites like Yahoo,
scatters them around the Internet, then directs users to the copy
that it can access with the smallest delay. By letting Akamai put
copies of the Web pages even closer to ExciteAtHome's customers,
the company could further reduce waiting time for users when they
sign on to customers like Yahoo.

 AMAZON DEAL LIFTS HP IN RACE AGAINST SUN  &HT;     By HENRY NORR 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Hewlett-Packard rang up a victory on multiple
fronts yesterday with a deal that makes it the ``primary Internet
infrastructure provider'' for e-commerce giant Amazon.com.
</P>
<P>
   Under the agreement, HP will supply 90 percent of Amazon's
computing needs, including high-powered Web servers, data-storage
systems and desktop PCs, as well as support services. Amazon, which
saw its net sales jump 95 percent to $594 million in the first
quarter, now relies primarily on hardware from Sun Microsystems and
Compaq Computer.
</P>
<P>
   The deal, HP said, instantly makes Amazon one of its five
largest customers.
</P>
<P>
   Although neither company would provide financial details, the
agreement is an important step in HP's efforts to rebuild its
server business, which until recently was steadily losing ground,
especially to Sun.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, because of Amazon's high profile as an e-commerce
pioneer, its endorsement is bound to lend credibility to HP Chief
Executive Officer Carly Fiorina's campaign to position her company
as a key player in the online economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they manage it right, HP could parlay a high-visibility
agreement like this to grab the attention of other dot-coms,'' said
analyst Lee Kroon of the D.H. Andrews Group. ``If they were smart,
they probably gave very good terms to Amazon to create some
`whisper' in the industry.''
</P>
<P>
   ``To a great extent this is a commodity marketplace,'' Kroon
added, ``and when you're up against tough competitors like Sun, you
have to make an investment to buy back market share.''
</P>
<P>
   Sun isn't HP's only rival in the server market, though _ IBM and
Compaq have also been scrambling to boost their presence,
especially in the fast-growing market for Internet servers. Sun
grabbed an early lead in that category, largely because it
recognized the potential of e-commerce before its rivals did.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, Sun's competitors have regained some ground,
according to analysts, in part because a new Sun chip called the
UltraSparc III has been delayed.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Sun continues to score major wins in the
server race. Just two weeks ago, eBay, the giant online auction
house, reaffirmed its commitment to Sun as its premier supplier of
servers, software, storage and professional services. That
announcement represented an important endorsement not only because
of eBay's size and prominence, but also because some company
officials had blamed Sun for a series of outages on its site last
summer.
</P>
<P>
   Yesterday's Amazon-HP agreement also makes the Palo Alto,
Calif., computer company an ``anchor tenant'' in Amazon's online
electronics store _ a provision that should help HP expand its
already fast-growing share of the PC market.
</P>
<P>
   Amazon sells HP printers, scanners, storage devices, supplies
and other products, but not its desktop or notebook PCs.
</P>
<P>
   In the first quarter of this year, HP passed IBM to take the No.
3 market position in worldwide PC sales, according to preliminary
estimates from International Data Corp. HP's PC sales were up 56
percent compared with the first quarter of 1999 _ a rate of growth
nearly three times that of the PC industry overall.

 MICROSOFT TAKES ITS LAST SHOT  &HT;     By KELLY ZITO 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ In its last filings before a federal judge signs
an expected breakup order against the company, Microsoft offered
additional testimony yesterday against such an ``excessive'' plan.
</P>
<P>
   The company also grudgingly suggested a longer timetable for
dividing the company in two.
</P>
<P>
   In a 37-page rebuttal to the Justice Department's proposal to
cleave the world's largest software company into two pieces,
Microsoft asked that it be given 12 months, instead of four, to
craft a blueprint for the breakup.
</P>
<P>
   ``The forced breakup of a unitary company like Microsoft is
unprecedented, and dividing the company in half would be an
enormously difficult task,'' the filing stated. ``Four months is
not remotely enough time to formulate a plan for attempting such an
undertaking.''
</P>
<P>
   The company also made minor changes, such as crossing out the
government's term ``reorganization'' throughout the proposal and
replacing it with ``divestiture.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson, the judge
overseeing the case, could sign off on the final remedy early as
today, thus ending an important chapter in the landmark antitrust
battle. Microsoft has signaled it will appeal the case, ensuring it
will be played out during the next year or two.
</P>
<P>
   In a separate brief also filed yesterday with Jackson, the
company focused on its longtime argument that breaking up the
company would be detrimental to the high-tech industry and the
economy.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft offered several high-profile executives, including
Jeffrey Katzenberg, co-founder of DreamWorks SKG, and Michael
Capellas, chief executive of Compaq, who the company said would
testify to that effect.
</P>
<P>
   The ``supplemental offer of proof'' follows on the heels of
another brief filed last week, shortly after Jackson abruptly
wrapped up the only hearing in the remedy phase.
</P>
<P>
   In that hastily filed document, Microsoft had proffered the
testimony of Chairman Bill Gates and chief executive Steve Ballmer.
The government, in its revised remedy, called the measure a
``cynical ploy'' designed to distract from the remedy proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   The briefs, though unlikely to sway Jackson, may help lay the
foundation for the company's planned appeal _ which could drag the
case out for another year or two.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department issued a statement late yesterday calling
the company's filing ``another effort to posture for appeal.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Much of Microsoft's submission is patently irrelevant to the
question before the court,'' the department said. ``The filing does
not come to grips with the fact that Microsoft has been found to
have repeatedly engaged in serious legal violations, and serious
remedies are required to restore competition and prevent similar
violations in the future.''
</P>
<P>
   On April 3, Jackson found that Microsoft used its monopoly in
the operating systems market _ the firm's Windows operating system
powers about 95 percent of the world's personal computers _ to
crush rivals, therefore squelching the number of choices in the
marketplace and thereby hurting consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Though Jackson is free to draft his own remedy plan, many expect
him to follow closely the proposal of the Justice Department and 17
state attorneys general. That plan, filed on Friday, calls for
snapping the Seattle company into two separate firms: one
controlling the Windows operating systems and another comprised of
Microsoft's other software and Internet holdings _ including the
popular Office suite, Internet Explorer and MSN.
</P>
<P>
   The company vehemently opposes a breakup and has denied breaking
the law. It did, however, acknowledge the plan's impact on the
company in an indirect way last week.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, the same day the government handed the judge its
final remedy plan, Microsoft postponed an important conference on
its ``Next Generation Windows Services'' initiative.
</P>
<P>
   Though employees will still receive a briefing on NGWS today,
media and analysts will have to wait until June 22 to hear about
the multibillion-dollar push to make its software available on
non-PC devices such as cell phones and Palm-type organizers.
</P>
<P>
   The project ``will be doomed to failure at the outset if
Microsoft is split along the arbitrary lines proposed by the
government,'' Gates said in a court filing last week.
</P>
<P>
   In yesterday's filing, Microsoft continued to assail the plan as
fundamentally ``defective'' and one that would have far-reaching,
negative effects on partners and customers.
</P>
<P>
   However, those who have followed the case closely are divided on
the merits of Microsoft's latest objections.
</P>
<P>
   Berkeley economics Professor Richard Gilbert, the former chief
economist for the Justice Department's antitrust division, said the
company may need additional time to formulate a breakup plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Microsoft raises a number of important issues, like how to
exchange the intellectual property needed to implement the
divestiture and how do you deal with issues in other countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't just snap your fingers and break apart a company,''
he added.
</P>
<P>
   Others called yesterday's filings weak.
</P>
<P>
   ``This filing really looks like Microsoft took out a 12-gauge
shotgun and pointed it at their foot,'' said Rich Gray, a Silicon
Valley attorney.
</P>
<P>
   In the offer of proof, ``their main argument is `Our customers
are going to be upset if the operating systems and applications are
going to be separate,''' he said. ``They should have made the point
that the world is moving away from the desktop PC to other
devices.''

 A WORLD OF SAFE HAVENS IN THE CHAOS OF CYBERSPACE  &HT;     By CARRIE KIRBY 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ An alternative to trying to control what kids do
on the Internet is directing them to safe online spots where
they're less likely to run into trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Safe Worlds
</P>
<P>
   For very young children, there are several closed networks where
little ones can't be lead astray because they're not on the
``real'' Net.
</P>
<P>
   One such ``walled garden'' is Your Own World
( &LR; www.yourownworld.com &LR; ), a free program released in February.
Parents install the software, then set it to regularly connect to
the Internet and download new material. Kids play games and read
age-appropriate content provided by Time (magazine) for Kids,
Muppets.com and other sources. Your Own World is advertised for
children under 12, but its cuddly cartoon characters look like they
would be most appealing to younger kids.
</P>
<P>
   JuniorNet ( &LR; www.juniornet.com &LR; ), another walled garden, is
subscription based, costs $9.95 a month, and offers similar content
from magazines including Highlights for Children and Ranger Rick.
</P>
<P>
   Similar to walled gardens are Web sites for kids that contain
links only to a preapproved list of partners. Lycos Zone, part of
the leading portal Lycos, links to sites providing homework help or
activities like sing-alongs. The site also has a filtered search
engine.
</P>
<P>
   However, if the garden is on the real World Wide Web, don't
expect its wall to be without gaps. Although Lycos' kids' search
engine _ and others such as Ask Jeeves for Kids ( &LR; www.ajkids.com &LR; )
and Yahooligans ( &LR; www.yahooligans.com &LR; ) _ lead to only
age-appropriate sites, some of those sites contained ads for
mainstream e-tailers. By following an ad on Lycos Zone for
FreeShop.com, a site that aggregates free offers such as trial
magazine subscriptions, it's possible to land (within two clicks)
in an Internet casino that takes MasterCard and Visa.
</P>
<P>
   Supervised Communities
</P>
<P>
   Chatting, instant messaging and e-mail are all extremely
attractive to kids who want to reach out to one another and make
friends in distant parts of the world. But with good reason, these
applications are at the top of many parents' lists of anxieties
about the Internet. Even adults can be fooled about who they're
talking to online _ a former executive for Disney's Go.com, Patrick
Naughton, was tricked by an undercover police officer into thinking
he was chatting with a 13-year-old girl for months. If an Internet
executive can't tell if he's chatting with an adult or a child, how
could the average 9-year-old?
</P>
<P>
   One solution is to use a filtering program to make chat, instant
messaging and e-mail unavailable; another is to be present whenever
a child is using these tools.
</P>
<P>
   But a more fun option has been presented by Surf Monkey , a
kids' community site that provides free e-mail accounts and chat
rooms, all supervised by adults. Using Surf Monkey e-mail, kids can
only send and receive messages to friends on a buddy list that
parents have approved. Kids can chat with anyone in the monitored
chat rooms, but all the information typed is reviewed before
posting, with personal details stripped out. Kids can meet in an
unmoderated chat room only with people on their buddy list.
</P>
<P>
   Surf Monkey also offers a free browser that provides some of the
functionality offered by retail filtering software.
</P>
<P>
   The buddy list rule eliminates the risk of kids finding surprise
XXX-rated advertising in their in-boxes.

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BROWNSVILLE, Texas _ It is a case that has all the elements of a
Charles Dickens novel: an aspiring young lawyer with a helpful
uncle and great expectations; a raft of poor relatives hoping to
reclaim their inheritances; and a tangled legal snarl that would
make the Jarndyce vs. Jarndyce lawsuit of ``Bleak House'' seem as
uncomplicated as a parking ticket.
</P>
<P>
   Concepcion Sauceda vs. Gilbert Kerlin et al. _ the case that
began on Wednesday in Texas District Court here _ pits 500
relatives of Padre Jose Nicolas Balli, an 18th-century Roman
Catholic priest, against a 90-year-old New York lawyer named
Gilbert Kerlin.
</P>
<P>
   The Balli family members say Kerlin, described even by the
opposing counsel as ``a brilliant lawyer,'' cheated some
unsophisticated rural Hispanic families out of as much as $11
million in mineral revenues for ancestral lands he obtained from
them more than 60 years ago. Kerlin says the lands, on Padre Island
near here, were never theirs to begin with and he never needed to
pay them any revenues.
</P>
<P>
   Once a desolate spit of sand and scrub brush, the 120-mile-long
island is rich in oil and gas and is now home to dozens of
high-rise condominiums, hundreds of residents, and the resort city
of South Padre Island.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was nothing to see but a Coast Guard station at the
south end and a fishing shack that had been knocked apart by
storms,'' recalled Kerlin in a 1996 deposition about the first time
he saw Padre Island. ``Otherwise it was just a barren barrier reef
with nothing out there but an occasional fishing expedition.''
</P>
<P>
   That was in 1938, and Kerlin, fresh out of Harvard Law School,
had just been hired by a rich uncle, Frederic N. Gilbert, to buy
the island after hearing about it from a Brownsville lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   The island is named for Padre Balli, who received the title to
the land from King Carlos III of Spain for his work managing church
funds. Padre Balli died in 1829, leaving most of the land to a
nephew, Juan Jose Balli, and his descendants.
</P>
<P>
   In 1830, Juan Balli sold the land to Santiago Morales for $700,
but Morales apparently suffered buyer's remorse and soon wanted his
money back. Juan Balli repaid the $700, but the reversal of the
sale was never officially recorded.
</P>
<P>
   Almost 100 years later, Kerlin set about trying to buy as much
of the land as he could for his uncle, though in the intervening
century, the island had been split into many smaller parcels as
members of the Balli family married and died.
</P>
<P>
   Kerlin hired a member of the family, Primitivo Balli, to
reconstruct the family tree and eventually signed 11 contracts with
various Balli descendants and others in which they gave Gilbert
60,000 acres of Padre Island and the Laguna Madre, a strip of water
that separates the island from the mainland, in exchange for a
share of any revenues from oil and gas wells, according to court
records.
</P>
<P>
   During the 1950s Kerlin acquired the Padre Island interests of
his uncle, who has since died.
</P>
<P>
   The families may also have received some cash for the deeds, but
the heirs are unsure how much. Kerlin's lawyer, M. Steve Smith,
told jurors Wednesday morning only that Gilbert and his partners
had lost $80,000 in the transactions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Juan Balli had sold his share of Padre Island to Santiago
Morales in the 1800s,'' Smith said. ``The Ballis sold Kerlin
nothing in 1938 because they had nothing to sell. Their deeds are
worthless.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was fraud and deception here all right, but it was on
the part of the Ballis.''
</P>
<P>
   The plaintiffs angrily disagree.
</P>
<P>
   ``They stole that land,'' said Bertha Reyes, 56, who married
into the Balli family, as she waited outside the courtroom. ``Those
poor people they got the deeds from couldn't even read and write
English, much less understand a legal contract.''
</P>
<P>
   Court records are filled with examples of Balli family members
questioning Kerlin about the original deal and about whether or not
any oil and gas revenues were due them, but for more than six
decades he has managed to put them off, arguing that their titles
to the land were questionable.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the Balli descendants produced evidence on
Wednesday, however, that Kerlin had used the titles at least twice
in earlier court cases to defend his rights to the property.
</P>
<P>
   But Smith told the court that Kerlin had used other subsequent
transactions perfected with ``superior titles'' to prove his claim
to the land over the years.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, the judge in the case, Pat McDowell of Dallas,
ordered lawyers and plaintiffs not to discuss the lawsuit, and
outside the courtroom on Wednesday both Kerlin and Smith said they
did not have time to talk about the case.
</P>
<P>
   But Reyes, whose mother-in-law is a direct Balli descendant, was
outspoken. She said her mother-in-law told her that the family
``owned Padre Island and they were to be paid $50 a month rent for
their land.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's all they thought they were doing, renting the land,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Family members say they never received any oil or gas revenues
from Kerlin, and one branch of the family filed a lawsuit in 1993
to collect at least $11 million in oil royalties they believe they
are owed.
</P>
<P>
   As news of that lawsuit spread, other family members began
questioning the terms of the deeds and filed other suits that were
combined into the single court case now being heard in Brownsville.
</P>
<P>
   Kerlin sold most of the surface rights in 1971, according to the
Balli family lawyer, Britt Monts, but kept the mineral rights and
continues to earn money from them.
</P>
<P>
   After describing Kerlin as ``a charming man, and sharp as a
tack,'' Monts told jurors: ``He has been paid substantial sums of
money from oil wells on that property that he should have shared
with the Balli family.''

 WEB GUARD ON DUTY  &HT;     By CARRIE KIRBY 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Summer vacation is coming. Do you know where
your children are? Of course you do. They're on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   In the summer, kids explore and inevitably get into some things
they shouldn't. It's no different on the Internet, where children
ages 2 to 17 now make up about 20 percent of users, according to
Media Metrix.
</P>
<P>
   Technology is available _ for $50 or less _ that lets parents
track their children's every move online and limit their travels to
proscribed paths. The software is in most cases easy to use.
</P>
<P>
   The difficult part is deciding whether to use it. Parents are
whipsawed by two veins of media sensationalism: On one side are
accusations from the American Civil Liberties Union and other
groups that filtering programs inadvertently deny access to many
innocent sites, deliberately block sites whose politics the
softwaremakers don't agree with and violate children's right to
free speech. On the other are stories about kids addicted to online
porn and child molesters marauding through chat rooms while posing
as kids.
</P>
<P>
   The good news is that it's not all or nothing _ tools for
supervising computer use come in a variety of forms, and most
software packages let parents turn off functions they find too
restrictive.
</P>
<P>
   ``The greatest risk that kids face on the Internet is being
denied access,'' said lawyer Parry Aftab, author of ``The Parent's
Guide to Protecting Your Children in Cyberspace.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't have to use just one (tool),'' Aftab said. ``You can
take one from column A and two from column B. And it will change as
the kids get older.''
</P>
<P>
   Here are the basic tools available for parents:
</P>
<P>
   Filters
</P>
<P>
   Filtering programs, such as Net Nanny, SurfWatch and Cybersitter
block out inappropriate sites in two ways: by blacklisting Internet
addresses known to lead to porn, violence and the like, and by
``reading'' the content of Web sites as they are accessed and
blocking them if they contain objectionable terms.
</P>
<P>
   To keep up with the new pages added to the Internet daily, most
filtering programs offer regular updates of new blocked sites that
can be downloaded from the company Web site. Some charge a
subscription fee; others provide the updates for free.
</P>
<P>
   It's easy to find problems with filtering software: Besides the
fact that some programs seem to have hidden political agendas, what
the software's manufacturer deems offensive may not be what parents
are concerned about.
</P>
<P>
   While most filters block almost all sexual content, the Center
for Media Education found that they're not as good at filtering out
material about cigarettes and alcohol.
</P>
<P>
   ``We found only one (SurfWatch) was effective at blocking over
50 percent of alcohol and tobacco promotional sites. Some filters
were blocking as little as 3 percent,'' said Charlene Simmons, CME
research associate. Fortunately, filters give parents the option to
adjust the parameters.
</P>
<P>
   For example, a parent concerned about online beer buying can ban
all URLs that include the word ``beer.''
</P>
<P>
   The reverse also works if a parent wants to permit kids to
access URLs or phrases that the software bans.
</P>
<P>
   Not all filters make their lists of blocked sites public. Net
Nanny provides a list of blocked sites along with the software, and
Cyber Patrol provides a search engine on its Web page where one can
type in a URL and find out if it's blocked. But others keep those
lists secret.
</P>
<P>
   Not all filtering software blocks the same categories of
content; while Cyber Patrol blocks cult material, Net Nanny
doesn't. Aftab suggests that parents examine their own priorities
and choose the filtering product that most closely matches those
values.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certain parents are concerned about sex, others are concerned
about hate and violence,'' Aftab said. If after adjusting the
parameters, the filter is still getting in the way of a homework
project or curiosity, parents can always temporarily shut it off.
</P>
<P>
   Cyber Patrol and Net Nanny allow parents to set up user profiles
for different children in case they want to allow relatively
unimpeded access to a high-school student while keeping his
grade-school sibling on a shorter leash.
</P>
<P>
   Several Internet service providers, including America Online,
provide Net access that's filtered right from the source,
eliminating the need to install filtering software. However, many
children's online safety experts discount ISP-based services
because they are too limited. ISPs generally don't filter what
children type in chat rooms or e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   ``They only filter what's coming into your home,'' said Mark
Brasche of Southington, Conn., author of ``Child Safety Net'' and
Webmaster of  &LR; www.surfsafely.com &LR; , both resources for parents
looking for online safety tips.
</P>
<P>
   The major filtering software products (except SurfWatch) offer
the option of filtering any message a child sends out to the
Internet, using e-mail, chat rooms or instant messaging. Parents
can specify exactly what information the child should not reveal;
the standards are full name, home address and credit card number.
If the kid tries to type a forbidden word or number, Xs appear
instead of the characters.
</P>
<P>
   However, while incoming filtering is difficult to circumvent
without knowing the parents' password, it's relatively easy to
thwart outgoing filtering if the child really wants to. If the
parent blocks the name ``Jane Smith,'' little Jane could still tell
people that her name is spelled ``J-a-n-e S-m-i-t-h'' or ``Ja ne
Smi th'' and the computer will probably not catch it. But this
feature effectively stops kids from ``blurting out'' their names or
numbers by accident.
</P>
<P>
   Time Control
</P>
<P>
   Some parents worry that the Internet has become the new TV,
wasting summer days and keeping kids from playing outside. Others
want kids to stay offline whenever a parent can't be there to
supervise. Recognizing this, all the major filters let parents
dictate when the Internet can be used, and for how long.
</P>
<P>
   For some kids, limiting Internet time may be the key to avoiding
online trouble.
</P>
<P>
   ``As soon as you get over an hour and a half a day, there's a
much higher risk of them getting into dangerous activities,'' Aftab
said.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; sh1  &LR; Monitoring
</P>
<P>
   Depending on how you look at it, monitoring kids' online
activities can be the most intrusive or the most liberal way to go.
Knowing that every keystroke they enter and every page they visit
is being recorded is a powerful incentive for kids to behave
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let kids know that you know what they're doing,'' said Warren
Buckleitner of the Children's Software Revue. Buckleitner prefers
monitoring to filtering because it gives kids a chance to obey the
rules before slapping down restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   Monitoring can be as low tech as always being in the room when
kids are online, or periodically checking Netscape or Internet
Explorer's history file, which lists every site the browser has
visited recently. (Hitting control H on either browser will reveal
the history.)
</P>
<P>
   Some filters provide lists of URLs visited and chat transcripts,
but to see each keystroke typed and each image viewed requires
heavy artillery: a surveillance program such as Spector.
</P>
<P>
   Spector is also marketed to employers who want to see what
workers are doing with their office Internet connections. The
software takes screen shots every few seconds and allows the parent
to replay a whole day or week's computer use, screen by screen. The
software can record the transcripts of chat sessions and e-mail
messages.
</P>
<P>
   Spector can be run on stealth mode, which means that unless they
are warned, the kids have no way of knowing that the software is
installed on the computer. In stealth mode, no Spector icon appears
on the toolbar, and searching the computer for the word ``Spector''
turns up nothing. However, kids who know their way around a
computer can dig up the files Spector is saving with their screen
shots.
</P>
<P>
   Spector offers an even more cloak-and-dagger product called
eBlaster, which e-mails the computer-use reports to the parent,
boss or CIA agent wherever they are.
</P>
<P>
   This all sounds very ``1984,'' but used sensibly, monitoring can
be the best way to protect kids _ especially teens who know better
_ from getting into trouble with the computer.
</P>
<P>
   With one caveat: Forget the stealth stuff.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to tell the kids ahead of time,'' Aftab said.
</P>
<P>
   After selecting the tools _ if any _ to use to keep the kids
safe on the Internet, Buckleitner suggests one more utility:
perspective.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't need to fly off the handle if you discover that your
child has seen an X-rated site,'' Buckleitner said. ``Understand
that some exploration is perfectly normal. It's part of being
human.''

 A WORLD OF SAFE HAVENS IN THE CHAOS OF CYBERSPACE  &HT;     By CARRIE KIRBY 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ An alternative to trying to control what kids do
on the Internet is directing them to safe online spots where
they're less likely to run into trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Safe Worlds
</P>
<P>
   For very young children, there are several closed networks where
little ones can't be lead astray because they're not on the
``real'' Net.
</P>
<P>
   One such ``walled garden'' is Your Own World
( &LR; www.yourownworld.com &LR; ), a free program released in February.
Parents install the software, then set it to regularly connect to
the Internet and download new material. Kids play games and read
age-appropriate content provided by Time (magazine) for Kids,
Muppets.com and other sources. Your Own World is advertised for
children under 12, but its cuddly cartoon characters look like they
would be most appealing to younger kids.
</P>
<P>
   JuniorNet ( &LR; www.juniornet.com &LR; ), another walled garden, is
subscription based, costs $9.95 a month, and offers similar content
from magazines including Highlights for Children and Ranger Rick.
</P>
<P>
   Similar to walled gardens are Web sites for kids that contain
links only to a preapproved list of partners. Lycos Zone, part of
the leading portal Lycos, links to sites providing homework help or
activities like sing-alongs. The site also has a filtered search
engine.
</P>
<P>
   However, if the garden is on the real World Wide Web, don't
expect its wall to be without gaps. Although Lycos' kids' search
engine _ and others such as Ask Jeeves for Kids ( &LR; www.ajkids.com &LR; )
and Yahooligans ( &LR; www.yahooligans.com &LR; ) _ lead to only
age-appropriate sites, some of those sites contained ads for
mainstream e-tailers. By following an ad on Lycos Zone for
FreeShop.com, a site that aggregates free offers such as trial
magazine subscriptions, it's possible to land (within two clicks)
in an Internet casino that takes MasterCard and Visa.
</P>
<P>
   Supervised Communities
</P>
<P>
   Chatting, instant messaging and e-mail are all extremely
attractive to kids who want to reach out to one another and make
friends in distant parts of the world. But with good reason, these
applications are at the top of many parents' lists of anxieties
about the Internet. Even adults can be fooled about who they're
talking to online _ a former executive for Disney's Go.com, Patrick
Naughton, was tricked by an undercover police officer into thinking
he was chatting with a 13-year-old girl for months. If an Internet
executive can't tell if he's chatting with an adult or a child, how
could the average 9-year-old?
</P>
<P>
   One solution is to use a filtering program to make chat, instant
messaging and e-mail unavailable; another is to be present whenever
a child is using these tools.
</P>
<P>
   But a more fun option has been presented by Surf Monkey , a
kids' community site that provides free e-mail accounts and chat
rooms, all supervised by adults. Using Surf Monkey e-mail, kids can
only send and receive messages to friends on a buddy list that
parents have approved. Kids can chat with anyone in the monitored
chat rooms, but all the information typed is reviewed before
posting, with personal details stripped out. Kids can meet in an
unmoderated chat room only with people on their buddy list.
</P>
<P>
   Surf Monkey also offers a free browser that provides some of the
functionality offered by retail filtering software.
</P>
<P>
   The buddy list rule eliminates the risk of kids finding surprise
XXX-rated advertising in their in-boxes.

 ASK JEEVES LOSES PRESIDENT AFTER 2 MONTHS  &HT;     By VERNE KOPYTOFF 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Emeryville, Calif., Internet search firm Ask
Jeeves said Wednesday that Ted Briscoe, the company's president and
chief operating officer, has resigned after serving for only two
months.
</P>
<P>
   Briscoe is leaving to become chief executive of Play Streaming
Media Group, a private Internet broadcasting company based in
Rancho Cordova, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   During Briscoe's tenure, Ask Jeeves' stock declined sharply
along with the rest of the Internet industry. The stock closed down
$1.63 Wednesday at $20, near its all-time low.
</P>
<P>
   When Briscoe became president in March, the stock was around
$80. It had been as high as $190 in November 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Ask Jeeves, which offers question-and-answer
Internet searches, has gained users faster than most of its
competitors. It has gone from being the 124th-ranked Web site in
March 1999 to the 13th-most-visited Web site in April, according to
Media Metrix, the online research company.
</P>
<P>
   Briscoe, who will remain at Ask Jeeves for several weeks to help
with the transition, joined the company as chief of marketing in
1999. Ask Jeeves, which has about 635 employees, said the
president's job will be eliminated and that other executives will
assume Briscoe's duties.

ELIAS WAS DEVILS' TOP DEMOLITION MAN 
</HEADLINE>
   By ALEX YANNIS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ Patrik Elias was one of the architects
for the Devils in the demolition of the Dallas Stars in the opening
game of the Stanley Cup finals. Elias' passing skills helped Jason
Arnott and Petr Sykora, his partners on the Devils' premier line,
score two goals each in the 7-3 rout Tuesday night. And Elias
helped get the Devils to this stage as he produced both goals in
the deciding game against the Flyers in the Eastern Conference
finals.
</P>
<P>
   Elias starred in the regular season as well, posting career
highs in goals (35) and points (72), leading the team in both
categories despite missing 10 games at the start of the season
because of a contract dispute. The crafty and elusive left wing has
simply picked up in the playoffs where he left off in the regular
season, leading the team in points with 18, one more than Sykora
and two more than Arnott.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're clicking well right now,'' Elias said Wednesday after a
team meeting to plan strategy for Game 2 against Dallas on Thursday
night. ``None of us shy away from the puck,'' Elias said, sharing
credit with Arnott and Sykora.
</P>
<P>
   Elias has shown a remarkable ability to mesh with Sykora, his
countryman from the Czech Republic, and his pass for Sykora's first
goal in the victory over Dallas in Game 1 had his teammates in awe.
</P>
<P>
   Collecting the puck on the left flank, Elias went behind the
goal and seemed headed to the opposite side, but he surprised
everyone by back-passing the puck to Sykora at goalie Ed Belfour's
right doorstep for Sykora's first goal of the night.
</P>
<P>
   ``It helps from the way we're raised and from the style of
hockey we've played,'' Elias said of his combining with Sykora.
``On that play, I just happened to pass it to the near post and
Petr was there.''
</P>
<P>
   Slava Fetisov, the former defenseman who is now an assistant to
Coach Larry Robinson, has been particularly impressed by Elias.
</P>
<P>
   ``He reminds me so much of Sergei Makarov,'' Fetisov said of his
former teammate on the Soviet national team. ``He's an extremely
intelligent hockey player.''
</P>
<P>
   Elias combined with Arnott and Sykora to produce the kind of
numbers expected from Brett Hull and Mike Modano of the Dallas
Stars. The Devils' threesome combined for 11 points from four goals
and seven assists.
</P>
<P>
   But the Devils do not want to look back.
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Holik spoke for nearly everyone when he said: ``Forget
yesterday, it's done. We have another game tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   Holik and others on the Devils said there was no overconfidence
after knocking Belfour out of Game 1 and keeping the Stars' top
line off the scoring sheet.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know they didn't play their best game and they are capable
of raising it a notch or two,'' Holik said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The important thing for us is to play our game,'' Holik added,
referring to the Devils' penalty-free performance.
</P>
<P>
   Martin Brodeur said the Devils were determined to capitalize on
their chances the way they did in the first game. ``It seems that
everything we threw at them went in,'' Brodeur said. ``We started
with the home-ice advantage and if we don't win tomorrow we lose
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Claude Lemieux said the Stars would be more physical in Game 2
and he did not expect another lopsided victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure they don't want to disappoint themselves two games in
a row, but we're desperate, too,'' Lemieux said. ``What matters is
that you're ready for the next game and you stick with the game
plan. The plan is to get the puck in deep and do the things we can
do best. Puck movement and skating has been the key for us.''

BABBITT RECOMMENDS MONUMENT STATUS FOR HANFORD REACH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOEL CONNELLY  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt, citing the need to
preserve natural landscapes of America's West, on Wednesday
recommended creation of a 200,000-acre Hanford Reach National
Monument on the last undammed stretch of the Columbia River.
</P>
<P>
   The stretch of river in Eastern Washington was one of four
national monument proposals that include the Anasazi Indian ruins
in Colorado, Soda Mountain in south-central Oregon, and a
mountainous area of Arizona's Sonoran Desert near Tucson.
</P>
<P>
   Babbitt's recommendation was welcomed by President Clinton, and
applauded by Gov. Gary Locke.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each of the areas recommended today represents an exceptional,
irreplacable piece of America's natural and cultural protection,''
Clinton said in a statement. Locke described the Reach as ``a
national treasure. ... In so many ways, it remains a snapshot of an
earlier time.''
</P>
<P>
   Capitol Hill sources predicted Wednesday night that Clinton,
using his authority under the 1906 Antiquities Act, may act within
a month to designate the national monument in Eastern Washington.
</P>
<P>
   But officials in three Central Washington counties continued to
oppose federal protection for the 51-mile Reach, the only undammed
stretch of the Columbia River between Bonneville Dam and the
U.S.-Canada border. They are not satisfied with Babbitt's promise
of an advisory role in monument management.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is insulting: It's an insult to the people of Central
Washington,'' Rep. Doc Hastings, R-Wash., said Wednesday. Hastings'
district includes the Hanford Reach.
</P>
<P>
   Sue Miller, a Franklin County Commissioner, said: ``Nobody is
required to take our advice. We know best of all what should happen
out there.
</P>
<P>
   ``A large number of the people I represent do not feel federal
control is in the best interests of the Hanford Reach,'' Miller
added.
</P>
<P>
   Rick Leaumont of Richland, head of the Lower Columbia Basin
Audubon Society, rebuked Hastings. ``I'm not insulted,'' Leaumont
said. ``This is a great day for the Tri-Cities.
</P>
<P>
   ``This designation will change the image of our community,''
Leaumont said. ``The world now sees us as a nuclear waste
repository. This will show that we live amidst natural beauty where
fish thrive, near a great wildlife haven. It says all the RIGHT
things about us.''
</P>
<P>
   Democratic lawmakers said that attempts to work out a compromise
have been scuttled by pro-development county commissioners and
agricultural interests who want to irrigate part of the federally
owned Wahluke Slope north of the Reach. The Reach is the last major
salmon spawning habitat on the Columbia River.
</P>
<P>
   ``We tried, we worked and we pleaded,'' Rep. Norm Dicks,
D-Wash., said Wednesday. ``If you're not going to take out the
Snake River dams, you need to do something else to protect these
fish. The Hanford Reach is an absolute priority. We had to take
this step. It was very clear that our colleagues simply intended to
block this.''
</P>
<P>
   But Sen. Slade Gorton, R-Wash., attacked Babbitt for the speed
of his recommendation. The Interior secretary toured the Hanford
Reach two weeks ago. Gorton argued that Babbitt ``was simply paying
lip service to the surrounding communities.''
</P>
<P>
   The national monument would include the Columbia River, the
Wahluke Slope, and still-wild areas of the 560-square-mile Hanford
Nuclear Reservation.
</P>
<P>
   If designated by Clinton, the monument would end 40 years of
struggle over the Reach.
</P>
<P>
   Officials in Grant and Franklin counties have campaigned for
more irrigation on the Wahluke Slope, despite water-caused erosion
and undermining of the white bluffs that overlook the river.
</P>
<P>
   ``The (salmon) spawning area can only be protected if the
Wahluke Slope is strictly off limits to future development,
including irrigation,'' Locke said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Under the Antiquities Act, a president can designate national
monuments to protect places of historic significance and scientific
interest. President Theodore Roosevelt used it to create 18
national monuments, including the Grand Canyon.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has aggressively used the act. Beginning with 1996
designation of the Escalante-Grand Staircase National Monument in
Utah's canyonlands, the president has protected landscapes ranging
from giant Sequoia trees in California to wild, flood-sculpted
tributaries of the Grand Canyon in northern Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Republicans on the House Appropriations Committee
amended a spending bill to take away presidential authority to
designate new national monuments. Clinton has vowed to veto the
legislation if it reaches his desk.
</P>
<P>
   The Hanford Reach National Monument would be managed by the U.S.
Fish and Wildlife Service, under agreements with the Department of
Energy. The Energy Department is overseeing cleanup of nuclear
waste at Hanford.
</P>
<P>
   Babbitt's monument proposal puts Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., on
the brink of a major political triumph. A few years ago, Murray
rafted the Reach with a Hanford nuclear worker named Richard
Steele, who has worked 40 years to preserve the river. She then
introduced legislation that would protect it under the Wild and
Scenic Rivers Act.
</P>
<P>
   ``This place is history for a number of reasons,'' Murray said
Wednesday. ``My dad grew up in the Tri-Cities. He told me before
his death that we should give something back to a region that has
given us so much. By doing this we protect salmon, cultural
artifacts, and the native plants and animals that came before us.''
</P>
<P>
   But Hastings delivered a scathing, unusually personal rebuke of
a fellow member of Congress. ``Either Senator Murray doesn't know
what the residents of Central Washington want, or she doesn't
care,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Gorton said that the Hanford Reach ``is under no immediate
threat'' from development and accused the Clinton administration of
``destroying years of negotiations.''
</P>
<P>
   But Steele argued that protection can't wait. He said irrigation
water has already done great damage to the Reach and its prized
salmon spawning beds.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's an area I fished 30 years ago, standing on a
cobblestone beach up to 100 yards wide,'' he said. ``When I
returned last Thanksgiving, the whole bar was covered with silt up
to three feet thick.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Jay Inslee, D-Wash., who represented Central Washington in
Congress until he was ousted by Hastings in 1994, added that
Congress will never protect the Reach.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of my colleagues have an ideological aversion to
protecting public lands: It's time to apply the Teddy Roosevelt
tradition,'' said Inslee, who now represents a suburban Western
Washington district in Congress.

FOR BELFOUR, MEDICINE WAS A CULPRIT IN LOSS 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ Will Eddie Belfour still be dazed and
confused? That is the main question facing the Dallas Stars when
they play Game 2 of the Stanley Cup finals Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   Belfour allowed six goals on only 18 shots before he was pulled
early in the third period of an embarrassing 7-3 loss to the Devils
Tuesday night in Game 1 at Continental Arena.
</P>
<P>
   The moody goaltender complained afterward that he was taking a
decongestant and had experienced problems with ``balance and
equilibrium'' during the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been told to get off it,'' Belfour said Wednesday, when
asked if he was still taking the prescribed medication.
</P>
<P>
   As the goaltender who anchored the Stars to the Stanley Cup
championship last season and through the playoffs this season,
Belfour is by far the team's most important player. Coach Ken
Hitchcock confirmed that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think what we learned last night is this: When Ed Belfour is
average or even below average, we are not a very good team,''
Hitchcock said. ``I think we need Eddie to be a great player. But
it also shows me how valuable this guy has been to our group. We
have made the same mistakes in other games and he saved our bacon.
Last night, for the first time maybe, he didn't do those things.''
</P>
<P>
   But, because Belfour, who still looked a little woozy Wednesday,
came out and blamed his poor performance on cold medication, it is
inevitable that some people will accuse the sometimes irascible
goalie of making up an excuse.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't an excuse; it was the truth,'' Hitchcock said. ``But
sometimes when Belfour says something, everybody thinks it's an
excuse.''
</P>
<P>
   After participating in an optional off-day skate Wednesday,
Belfour said: ``I don't like to use things like that as an excuse.
I didn't play my best game. I didn't have a lot of energy today.
But it was a chance to get a good sweat. And regardless of how I
feel tomorrow, I have to find a way to play my best game. I've
played with something like this before. Regardless, you have to
find a way to win, no matter how you feel out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Hitchcock was asked why Belfour was even playing while taking a
decongestant that made the goalie feel off balance.
</P>
<P>
   How could he be expected to face 100 mph pucks?
</P>
<P>
   ``Look,'' Hitchcock said, ``he is the horse that has gotten us
this far, and we are going to ride him all the way through.''

<P>
   BINGHAMTON, N.Y. _ Rep. Rick Lazio sought to build momentum in
his campaign for the Senate on Wednesday, riding his newly
christened ``Mainstream Express'' across upstate New York as he
greeted supporters and stepped up criticism of his opponent.
</P>
<P>
   Fresh from the Republican Party's state convention on Tuesday at
which he was named the Republican nominee to face Hillary Rodham
Clinton in November, Lazio strolled with his wife, Patricia,
through a winery and a glass museum and along a downtown street in
rustic Watkins Glen.
</P>
<P>
   He made five stops, traveling from Syracuse to Binghamton and
stopping overnight in Newburgh, from which he will continue a tour
that will travel through the New York metropolitan area before
ending Friday on Long Island.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio said the title of the bus was meant to emphasize what he
considered his mainstream voting record in the House and ``to
reinforce this is a grass-roots campaign, that we are going to be
out and open and among the people.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to be answering your questions like I am right now
at every stop,'' he told reporters. The campaign, he added in a
reference to the tight security around the first lady, ``should not
be about rope lines and checking credentials and scripted
responses.''
</P>
<P>
   Lazio seemed unaware that his own campaign staff had issued
credentials to reporters to ride on the bus trailing his, which is
modeled after Sen. John McCain's ``Straight Talk Express'' used
during this year's presidential primary season, though Lazio is not
granting reporters the same freewheeling access as the senator had.
</P>
<P>
   And Lazio's penchant to answer questions at stops meant for
meeting and greeting people appears to grate on his staff. ``Guys,
no more walking avails,'' a campaign aide cautioned reporters,
using jargon for news conference. This came after reporters jostled
for space and access to Lazio after he toured a crammed milk
bottling plant in Syracuse.
</P>
<P>
   And despite his pledge of a less-structured campaign style,
there were ample signs that Lazio's appearances were as scripted as
any other candidate.
</P>
<P>
   At the stop in Watkins Glen, a teen-age volunteer from the
office of U.S. Rep Amo Houghton told supporters who had been
rounded up by phone, ``You just follow me when I start cheering,
OK,'' before Lazio's bus pulled up.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio also repeated variations of what sounded like a stump
speech that he had been offering for the last week, talking about
the ``need to earn this'' and to find ways to stop a brain drain of
young people to other states that amounted to ``exporting our
children from this state.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's staff issued a statement on Wednesday, taking issue
with Lazio's criticisms of ``scripted responses.'' The statement
said the prepared text of Lazio's convention speech at one point
contained a note ``(smile)'' as if to remind him to do so when he
commented on the ``low wages'' his father paid him for helping out
in the family store. Lazio did smile.
</P>
<P>
   ``Candidates in glass buses shouldn't throw stones,'' Howard
Wolfson, Clinton's campaign spokesman, said. ``Once again, Rick
Lazio's rhetoric doesn't match reality.''
</P>
<P>
   In one of a series of 15-minute interviews that he has begun
granting, Lazio said he was speaking from the heart and denied that
he had a prepared speech, challenging reporters to watch for one.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got to sort of depend on you guys to set the record
straight because you are out there and you've seen what's real,''
Lazio said. ``If you think I'm reading questions and reading a
stump speech every time I go out, then I think you have cause for
making a point.''

UCLA'S SCOTT HAVING BIG YEAR, NO MATTER WHAT SCOUTS SAY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CHRIS COCOLES  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ His wrist has bothered him, the scouts have
criticized him. But Bill Scott is having a good time playing
baseball for UCLA.
</P>
<P>
   And having a record-breaking season. The junior left fielder
from Alemany High of Mission Hills, Calif., is batting .430 with 21
homers and 75 RBI and was named All-America by USA Today and
Collegiate Baseball.
</P>
<P>
   The fun continues on Friday, when Scott and the Bruins play at
LSU in a NCAA Super Regional opener. The winner in the
best-of-three series advances to the College World Series in Omaha,
Neb.
</P>
<P>
   Scott is just the third Bruin (Troy Glaus was the most recent)
with at least 20 homers and 100 hits in a season. A 4-for-5
performance in Sunday's regional championship win over Oklahoma
gave Scott 111 hits, breaking Glaus's single-season record of 108.
</P>
<P>
   Should he remain hot in the Super Regionals, Scott is on pace to
surpass Don Slaught's 21-year-old school record for highest batting
average (.428) in a season.
</P>
<P>
   Helping UCLA reach the College World Series is his primary goal
this weekend in Baton Rouge. But Scott is now eligible for Monday's
first-year player draft and can't help but think about it.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball America was impressed enough to rank him 22nd in the
publication's preseason rankings of draft-eligible collegians.
</P>
<P>
   But his outfield defense and arm strength Scott had surgery
during high school have been questioned. When Baseball America
recently released its latest Top 100 high school and college draft
prospects, Scott was omitted.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've made up their mind. They're not going to change their
minds in the next week,'' he said of the scouts who flocked to
Jackie Robinson Stadium throughout the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no control where I go in the draft. ... You've done all
you can do and you hope you've done your best. Everybody has to
take a little criticism. Scouts say stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Gary Adams, who has coached 10 first-round picks in 26 years at
UCLA, knows what prospects such as Scott go through as draft day
approaches.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so much pressure. Everyone dreams about playing in the
major leagues,'' Adams said.
</P>
<P>
   Scott is no different. He understands his defense needs work and
he could eventually play first base. But he's confident he can work
on his weaknesses.
</P>
<P>
   No one doubts his bat. As a sophomore, he smacked 28 home runs,
but the seven fewer homers this year is more than balanced by a
50-point jump in batting average. Plus, he has just 29 strikeouts
in 258 at-bats.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a power hitter that doesn't strike out. A pitcher can
have two strikes on him and he's willing to go the opposite way
instead of trying to hit a home run,'' Adams said.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he's hot, he's really hot. And he's never cold. You know
he's going to be consistent.''
</P>
<P>
   His steady play has come in a year when Scott has been banged
up. He sprained his ankle during the final weekend of the regular
season at Stanford two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   His right wrist injury, suffered while swinging, was much more
serious, though Scott started 61 of UCLA's 62 games.
</P>
<P>
   ``(The injury) was really impinging my swing. ... It was hard to
get the bat through the zone on outside pitches,'' Scott said. ``I
tried to deal with it the best way I could.''
</P>
<P>
   His numbers would say Scott did a pretty fair job of dealing
with it.
</P>
<P>
   In three UCLA regional wins in Oklahoma City, Scott hit .533 (8
for 15) with four doubles, four RBI and five runs scored to earn
all-region team honors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll take what he's doing right now. He's driving in runs.
He's doing it with singles, doubles and home runs,'' Adams said.
``Despite those injuries, he's put together another great year.'' &QL;

THE LAKERS JUST SHRUG AND SAY THEY'RE READY FOR GAME 6
</HEADLINE>
  By TOM SPOUSTA   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ They claimed a sense of urgency, not a feeling of
panic. As Glen Rice and A.C. Green engaged in a loose post-practice
shooting drill and teammates casually heaved half-court shots
around them, the Lakers gave the impression Wednesday that their
Game 5 freeze had already thawed.
</P>
<P>
   Green and Rice took turns running at each other while shooting
jump shots in an effort to simulate the Portland defense that
suddenly became nasty during the Trail Blazers' 96-88 victory in
Game 5 on Tuesday night. Despite playing at home, the Lakers had
their lead cut to 3-2 in the best-of-7 Western Conference finals.
</P>
<P>
   Rice, Robert Horry and Kobe Bryant in particular were harassed
in Game 5 and missed a combined 24 of 32 shots. Coming off 21
points on 7-of-11 shooting Sunday, Rice was 1 of 8 Tuesday night.
Horry was 3 of 11. Bryant, who played on a right foot sprained in
the first quarter and who battled foul trouble throughout, was 4 of
13.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But in a series of wild momentum swings and two victories by
each team on the other's home court, the Lakers did not seem
concerned about shots not falling Friday night at the Rose Garden.
</P>
<P>
   Bryant shook off his cold hand and tender foot and pronounced
himself fit for Game 6 in Portland. Rice shrugged off his
inaccuracies, saying the ball sometimes just doesn't go in the
basket. Horry, who has made only 8 of 24 attempts in the last four
games, believed the Lakers spent too much time forcing 3-point
shots; they tried 27, but made only six.
</P>
<P>
   ``It had a lot to do with Portland's defense,'' Rice said.
``They didn't allow us to get in our offense as easily as we did in
previous games.''
</P>
<P>
   Shaquille O'Neal said: ``We were so anxious to put this team
away, we didn't take care of our business properly. We're going to
be fine.''
</P>
<P>
   Lakers coach Phil Jackson attributed the loss to little mistakes
magnified by the Trail Blazers' aggressive play and their
desperation not to be eliminated. He pointed to the third quarter,
when the Lakers shot 60 percent and Portland's eight-point halftime
lead grew to 13 points heading into the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson offered at least one excuse for his team's 38 percent
shooting. Before Game 5, Jackson held the Lakers' shoot-around at
their training facility in El Segundo near Los Angeles
International Airport, before going downtown to the Staples Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``Little stuff like that,'' Jackson said. ``Portland looked more
comfortable on our court than we did.''
</P>
<P>
   The Trail Blazers were more determined from the start. Led by 22
points each from Scottie Pippen and Rasheed Wallace, Portland
dictated a pace that was fast and physical. The Lakers never
adjusted, especially to Pippen, who was quicker afoot and lighter
in the wallet for Game 5.
</P>
<P>
   Pippen had been fined $10,000 by the NBA for his forearm to the
back of John Salley's head with 52 seconds left in Game 4, an
incident that Jackson complained should have resulted in a one-game
suspension. Despite dislocating two fingers in the first quarter
Tuesday night, Pippen also delivered six rebounds, six steals and
four blocked shots.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know in our hearts we can outplay this team,'' Pippen said.
``We have throughout this series, but we haven't completed it in
the games. We feel like we're going to outplay them every time out
on the court.''
</P>
<P>
   With a victory Friday night at Portland, the Lakers can advance
to the NBA finals for the first time since 1991, when they lost to
the Chicago Bulls. Should the Trail Blazers win, Game 7 will be
Sunday at the Staples Center.
</P>
<P>
   Rice said: ``They have a little more life. It's 3 to 2. They
have everything to be confident about. But so do we. They know they
haven't beaten us up there yet in this series.''  &QL;

JUDGE RULES IN FAVOR OF PAKISTANIS IN HOTEL DISPUTE 
</HEADLINE>
  By CHARLES V. BAGLI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Milstein real estate family has lost a bruising
battle with Prince Faisal ibn Khalid of Saudi Arabia and Pakistan
International Airlines over the historic Roosevelt Hotel, near
Grand Central Terminal.
</P>
<P>
   The Milsteins must repay the prince and the airline $23 million
of the $59.5 million they paid for the 1,013-room hotel on Madison
Avenue in 1999, according to a decision in state Supreme Court last
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Ira Gammerman ruled that the Milsteins must adhere to
their 1979 agreement to sell the hotel to the investors for $36.5
million, which is one-seventh of its current value, hotel analysts
say. The Milsteins had forced the airline to pay off a $23 million
mortgage on the hotel before they would agree to the sale.
</P>
<P>
   It was a good deal gone bad for the Milsteins and a windfall for
the Pakistanis, who had lost money on the hotel nearly every year
since they took it over in 1979, under a lease with an option to
buy in 20 years. They now own a major hotel at one of Manhattan's
best corners, Madison Avenue and 45th Street.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a battle,'' Aslam R. Khan, managing director of
Pakistan Airlines Investments, said Wednesday. ``They didn't want
to let it go. I'm grateful that justice prevailed.''
</P>
<P>
   Edwin V. Petz, general counsel for Milstein Properties Corp.,
declined to talk about the decision. ``We expect to appeal,'' he
said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   To press his case, Khan had hired Chadbourne &AMP; Parke, the law
firm that represented the airline in the original deal with the
Milsteins.
</P>
<P>
   In his decision last Friday, Gammerman said that he was left
with the impression that the litigation was ``the culmination of
the Milsteins' efforts to find a loophole in the lease in the hope
of escaping an agreement which, with the passage of time, appeared
to be less favorable than originally anticipated.''
</P>
<P>
   Built in 1924 by a predecessor of the Penn Central Railroad to
serve passengers at Grand Central Terminal, the 20-story Roosevelt
was one of the first hotels in the world to offer a health club,
child care and a kennel for guests' dogs. In its heyday, Guy
Lombardo broadcast ``Auld Lang Syne'' over the radio from the
Roosevelt Grill.
</P>
<P>
   But the hotel and Penn Central had fallen on hard times by 1978,
when the Loews Corp. bought the Roosevelt, as well as the Barclay
and the Biltmore Hotels, for $55 million. Loews promptly resold the
Roosevelt to Paul Milstein, a major New York developer, for $30
million.
</P>
<P>
   Milstein leased the hotel to the Pakistani airline for $2.7
million to $4 million a year. He also gave it an irrevocable option
to buy the hotel, court papers show. The city was wracked by a
fiscal crisis, so it seemed a good deal for the Milsteins.
</P>
<P>
   But when the Pakistanis moved to buy the hotel in 1999, a real
estate boom was under way. The 1979 agreement had specified a sale
price of $36.5 million. Paul's son, Howard Milstein, was no longer
eager to sell a hotel that was now worth more than $250 million.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, Faisal, who had invested in the original deal,
and the airline had lost more than $70 million operating the hotel,
where the carpets were threadbare and the brass was tarnished. The
Pakistanis closed the hotel in 1995 for a $65 million renovation
and hired a new management company, Interstate Hotels. The hotel
reopened in 1997 and began making money in the next year, when the
investors moved to buy the hotel for $36.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   The Milstein family stalled, and later demanded that the airline
also pay off a $23 million mortgage, which the Milsteins had taken
out. At the same time, building, fire and health inspectors swarmed
over the hotel, issuing citations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were putting out fires every day,'' Jim Heineman, a former
manager of the Roosevelt, said in an interview last fall. ``We
certainly felt there was pressure on us.''
</P>
<P>
   The airline bought the hotel for $59.5 million last year and
went to court. Last week, Gammerman said he found most of the
testimony on behalf of the Milsteins ``to be contrived or lacking
in meaningful detail,'' and ordered the real estate family to
reimburse the investors.

`NEXT GENERATION OF WEAPONRY' WILL NEED BILLIONS, BUSH SAYS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By CLAY ROBISON 
c.2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. _ George W. Bush said Wednesday that the
United States, while considering reductions in its nuclear arsenal,
also must commit billions of additional dollars to technological
research to develop new ``peacekeeping'' weapons for the future.
</P>
<P>
   The likely Republican presidential nominee said that he will
urge Congress to increase spending on defense research and
development by $20 billion over the next five years. And he
promised to direct that 20 percent of the defense procurement
budget be used to purchase the ``next generation of weaponry.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not enough to make incremental improvements on existing
(weapons) systems,'' Bush told a sun-baked crowd of several hundred
at an outdoor veterans memorial park on the second day of a
campaign swing through the West.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our mission is to design and develop quantum-leap weapons,
weapons that will dominate the battlefields of the future, weapons
that will allow America to redefine how war is fought and won, and
therefore allow this great nation to redefine how the peace is
kept,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the Texas governor proposed a reduction in American
nuclear warheads and an expansion of a missile defense system to
help protect national security and keep the peace in the post-Cold
War era.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, speaking in a state where the Los Alamos and
Sandia research facilities would likely play a key role in the
development of futuristic weapons, Bush said major changes in
military preparedness are essential.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today's military is organized more for Cold War threats than
for challenges of the new century,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``America's forces in the next century must be agile and lethal,
readily deployable and require a minimum of logistical support. We
must be able to project our power over long distances in days and
weeks, rather than months.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush admitted that ``transforming our military is going to be a
massive undertaking.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But we have no choice,'' he added. ``The choices we make now
in the quiet days of peace will determine the world as we head into
the 21st century. I look forward to seizing the moment.''
</P>
<P>
   A day earlier in Denver, Bush had criticized President Clinton
and Vice President Al Gore, saying they had allowed the U.S.
military to fall into a sorry state of poor morale and low
preparedness. Gore is the probable Democratic presidential nominee.
</P>
<P>
   That provoked a response Wednesday from Gore's campaign, saying
Bush should look to his own service as a state commander-in-chief
before leveling criticism elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is just one more example of where the governor's rhetoric
does not match the record in Texas,'' said Gore spokesman Chris
Lehane. ``He's spent the last several days talking about the state
of readiness of the United States military, when in fact some of
the same issues he's raising exist in the Texas National Guard,
where he's commander-in-chief.''
</P>
<P>
   The Houston Chronicle in 1997 and 1998 reported widespread
allegations of racism and sexual misconduct in the Texas State
Guard, a state militia that falls under the control of Brig. Gen.
Daniel James III, a Bush appointee. There also were admissions that
the Texas Army National Guard and Air National Guard had a low
state of military readiness.
</P>
<P>
   James, who oversees all three forces, told a state House
committee in 1998 that he was attempting to address personnel
problems within the State Guard. He blamed the preparedness
deficiencies in the National Guard units on funding cutbacks by the
Pentagon, acknowledging, ``we're not as ready as we've been in the
past.''
</P>
<P>
   But James' spokesman, Lt. Col. John Stanford, said Wednesday the
Texas guard units have taken on major military roles, despite
receiving less funding than goes to other state guards.
</P>
<P>
   Stanford said 700 members of the 49th Armored Division of the
Texas National Guard make up the headquarters command of the
multinational forces in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   Stanford said personnel problems within the State Guard unit
were resolved two years ago. Stanford said he knows of no current
sexual harassment cases pending in the state militia.
</P>
<P>
   On the campaign trail in New Mexico, Bush said that he is well
satisfied with the Texas State Guard and National Guard.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is this the mode of the campaign, when the vice president says
`I'm going to campaign positively'?'' he said. ``Danny James has
done an excellent job as the adjutant general, and people who
follow the guard in Texas know that.''

PATAKI ORDERS TOUR BUS LINE OFF THE STREETS 
</HEADLINE>
   By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Nine days after a double-decker tour bus killed a
pedestrian at a midtown Manhattan intersection, Gov. George E.
Pataki on Wednesday shut down the tour company for at least two
weeks, and vowed to put it out of business permanently.
</P>
<P>
   The governor had the state Department of Motor Vehicles suspend
the vehicle registrations for all 63 buses run by New York Apple
Tours, after an investigation by an array of city and state
agencies found hundreds of violations of state laws. Those
violations could result in hundreds of thousands of dollars in
fines against the company, and possible jail time for some of its
employees.
</P>
<P>
   The company, which has repeatedly run afoul of city, state and
federal authorities, can contest the suspensions at a DMV hearing
on June 13. If it fails, the buses will be off the road
permanently.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't tolerate an operation that ignores the regulations
and flouts the law,'' Pataki told reporters in Albany. ``They
should be, in my view, put out of business.''
</P>
<P>
   The company's double-decker buses have become a ubiquitous
presence on city streets in recent years. But as the buses have
proliferated with the city's tourism boom, they have also drawn
angry criticism in residential neighborhoods for clogging and
polluting streets, as well as for posing safety threats.
</P>
<P>
   The death of a pedestrian last week heightened pressure for
stronger action against the company.
</P>
<P>
   While the company could, in theory, resume operation with a new
fleet of buses, state officials said the Department of Motor
Vehicles could make it very difficult for New York Apple to receive
new vehicle registrations.
</P>
<P>
   The administration of New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani has
already moved to revoke the company's operating license, and
Wednesday an administrative judge temporarily sided with the city,
suspending its license until full hearings into the matter are
completed.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The state order was served on the company Wednesday morning,
state officials said, and should have been effective immediately,
but New York Apple's readily recognizable bright red double-decker
buses continued to run throughout the day.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani released a statement saying that ``commuters and
visitors will be safer'' because of the governor's action.
</P>
<P>
   The tour company refused requests to interview its officials,
but it issued a statement in which it said it was ``shocked and
surprised'' by the state's action and contended that the company
had been treated unfairly.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are dismayed by this administration's rush to judgment
without granting us our day in court,'' the statement said. ``We
deserve better. We look forward to defending and clearing our good
name and serving the visitors of the greatest city in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, opponents of the company praised the governor's
action, but said the city and the state should have moved against
the company long ago. ``I'm only sorry that someone had to die for
us to get this kind of response,'' said state Sen. Thomas K. Duane
of Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   While the city had been moving for a month to shut the company
down, it was the death of Randolph Walker, a 71-year-old actor, on
May 22 that brought matters to this point.
</P>
<P>
   Walker was strolling home from an audition when he was hit at
the intersection of Ninth Avenue and 45th Street, where, the police
said, he was crossing with the right of way. They said the bus
driver, Howard Scott, 41, was not licensed to drive a bus.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki said that after Walker was killed, he ordered an
immediate audit of the company, and he and Giuliani arranged for a
full-court press by a variety of agencies, looking into every
aspect of its operations.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, the state audits the operation of bus companies every
three years, and New York Apple was due for an audit next year.
</P>
<P>
   The new state audit, by the motor vehicle department and city
and state transportation agencies, found 625 violations of state
laws, triple the number that were found in a 1998 audit. Pataki
said the company's disregard for the law had become ``significantly
worse'' in two years.
</P>
<P>
   New York Apple, which also operates tours in Brooklyn, has been
cited by the city and state for a wide range of misdeeds, like
switching license plates on buses to avoid inspections, violating
building and environmental codes at its garage and driving off its
authorized routes.
</P>
<P>
   The company's drivers have received 1,400 traffic summonses,
including many for reckless driving, and have been involved in 140
accidents, according to city officials.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the company admitted lying to the federal government
about the age of the buses it was importing from Britain to
circumvent emissions standards, and paid an $800,000 fine.
</P>
<P>
   A study found that its buses, many dating from the 1970s,
created 25 times as much pollution as new buses.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998 and 1999, safety inspectors from the state Department of
Transportation gave failing grades to 42 percent of the company's
buses, often for faulty brakes.
</P>
<P>
   In the new audit, the company was cited 245 times for failing to
notify the Department of Motor Vehicles every time it hired or
fired a driver, 205 times for failing to maintain complete records
on its drivers, and dozens of times each for failing to check
drivers' driving records before hiring them and for failing to give
them physicals.
</P>
<P>
   In a parallel investigation, the State Department of
Environmental Conservation said it found several violations of
environmental laws at its depot in the Greenpoint section of
Brooklyn. Two of those are misdemeanor crimes that could mean a
year in jail for company officials: failure to register a waste oil
tank with the state, and failure to take adequate measures to keep
that tank from leaking.
</P>
<P>
   The department found that the company had illegally disposed of
used motor oil and allowed oil to contaminate the groundwater.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki said that the State Department of Insurance had
subpoenaed company records to see whether it had complied with laws
on liability coverage.

</P>
<P>
   Tom Constantine, 61, a former New York state police chief and
head of the Drug Enforcement Administration until his retirement
last year, is to take charge of reshaping Northern Ireland's
police. The British government said he would be responsible for
overseeing proposed reforms to the Royal Ulster Constabulary, the
93-percent Protestant force that is to be renamed the Police
Service of Northern Ireland and employ more Catholics.

   The hard-line Democratic Unionists of the Rev. Ian Paisley said
they would fill their two seats in the 10-man Cabinet of the
power-sharing government on a rotating basis as long as Sinn Fein,
the political wing of the Irish Republican Army, is permitted to
keep its two seats. The party's deputy head, Peter Robinson, said
the arrangement was intended to frustrate the work of the
Legislature and bring down the peace accord.

letting more come in. The bill will go to the upper house on July

<P>
   The military ruler, Pervez Musharraf, told businessmen he would
not back away from a plan to raise sales taxes and require tax
evaders to pay up despite a continuing strike by shopkeepers in
most major markets. Pakistan is deeply in debt and trying to
convince international lenders that it is increasing tax
collections.

   Israel: Women and the Wall
</P>
<P>
   A bill that passed parliament in a preliminary reading would
make it illegal for Jewish women to wear a prayer shawl, don
phylacteries or blow a ram's horn at the Western Wall. The bill,
which requires three more readings to become law, is intended to
bypass a recent High Court ruling that said women should be allowed
to pray at the wall just as men do. &QL;

   Iraq: U.N. Panel Re-Elected
</P>
<P>
   Iraq's oil minister said in Baghdad that the government of
Saddam Hussein would not deal with a new arms inspection commission
being organized at the United Nations. The chief inspector, Hans
Blix of Sweden, is about to submit to the Security Council his
first report on the start-up of the body, the U.N. Monitoring
Verification and Inspection Commission, which is interviewing
experts to monitor Iraq. Under council resolutions, Iraq cannot
have sanctions lifted until it cooperates with the panel.

TOUR TO APPEAL RULING ON CARTS TO HIGH COURT 
</HEADLINE>
   By MARCIA CHAMBERS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ending weeks of speculation, the PGA Tour has decided to appeal
to the U.S. Supreme Court a federal appeals court decision that
allows Casey Martin to ride a cart in PGA Tour events, a lawyer for
Martin said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The tour asked Justice Sandra Day O'Connor two weeks ago for a
60-day extension to file a petition to the court seeking a review
of the case. O'Connor, herself a golfer, granted the tour an
extension until July 5.
</P>
<P>
   Roy L. Reardon, Martin's lawyer, said: ``We opposed the tour's
petition. They have seen Casey perform in a cart on both the Nike
and PGA Tour. They can see he has no advantage over other
players.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the tour said Wednesday that the board of
directors had discussed the Martin case at a meeting last week, but
that the tour would make no immediate announcement on the matter.
The tour's plans to appeal to the Supreme Court were first reported
Wednesday in The Washington Post.
</P>
<P>
   The tour cited a recent conflict between two federal appeals
court decisions about golfers seeking to ride carts in professional
competitions. ``These unsettled issues are substantial and of
potentially widespread significance,'' the tour's lawyers wrote in
seeking the extension. Although the Supreme Court takes only a
small percentage of cases for review, one criterion for acceptance
is a split in the circuit courts.
</P>
<P>
   The 9th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals in San Francisco upheld a
lower federal court decision in March, giving Martin the right to
ride a cart. Martin, 27, has Klippel-Trenaunay-Weber syndrome, a
rare circulatory disorder, in his right leg. His lawsuit became the
first to be filed by a professional athlete under the Americans
With Disabilities Act. The tour mounted a vigorous challenge
primarily on the grounds that walking is an essential part of
high-level golf competition.
</P>
<P>
   As Martin's case went through the courts, Ford Olinger, a club
pro from Indiana who has a degenerative hip, filed a lawsuit
against the U.S. Golf Association seeking to use a cart to play
qualifying events for the U.S. Open. Unlike the court in
California, a three-member panel of the 7th Circuit U.S. Court of
Appeals in Chicago ruled for the USGA.
</P>
<P>
   Olinger, 33, has appealed his case to the entire 11-member
Seventh Circuit court. If he loses, his lawyer, John C. Hamilton,
has said he will appeal to the Supreme Court as well.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a third case involving a Texas golfer seeking to use
a cart to qualify for the U.S. Senior Open is now before the 5th
Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals in Austin, Texas.  &QL;

FEDERAL GOVERNMENT BACKS HUDSON RIVER PARK
</HEADLINE>
 By BARBARA STEWART   
 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ After more than two years of study, the federal
government gave its approval on Wednesday for the construction of
the Hudson River Park, clearing what is probably the last major
hurdle in the plan to create a ribbon of parkland along five miles
of the Manhattan riverfront from Battery Park City to West 59th
Street.
</P>
<P>
   The approval from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers allows for
construction to begin in the river itself, repairing the Civil
War-era seawall and the 13 huge rotting piers that are the
centerpiece of the plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``The West side of Manhattan, along with the rest of the city,
has been looking forward to this park for a very long time,'' said
Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, who joined Gov. George Pataki in Manhattan
on Wednesday to announce that foundation work in the river would
begin as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``The park will ensure that the Hudson River is part of our
everyday lives,'' Pataki said, ``not just as that waterway we see
from the car.''
</P>
<P>
   Last September, the mayor and the governor opened the first
phase of the park, running about 1,000 feet between West Houston
and Bank Streets in lower Manhattan. When it is completed, the park
will have a continuous riverfront esplanade planted with lawns and
flowers, bicycle and running trails and playgrounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're New York City and we have the crummiest waterfronts in
the United States,'' said Albert K. Butzel, chairman of the Hudson
River Park Alliance, a coalition of 35 community and environmental
organizations that support the project. ``It's time to have a
waterfront that celebrates the city, instead of the derelict
waterfronts we have now.''
</P>
<P>
   But in the months to come, there will almost certainly be more
legal challenges. Several national and local environmental
organizations, including Friends of the Earth and the Clean Air
Campaign, have long opposed the Hudson River Park. Opponents say
that the many varieties of fish that migrate along that part of the
Hudson, including striped bass and sturgeon, could be seriously
harmed by construction work in the river. They say that a federal
environmental impact study should be required for construction of
this magnitude.
</P>
<P>
   But Joseph Seebode, chief of the regional branch of the Corps of
Engineers, in New York, said that the state environmental impact
study that has already been completed was exhaustive. The state
environmental study and the Army's own investigation indicated that
there will be ``minimal impact on the Hudson River itself and on
the fisheries and wildlife,'' Seebode said.
</P>
<P>
   The Hudson River Park is expected to cost $330 million to $350
million. So far, $100 million has been set aside by the city and
state. The state and city have pledged to provide at least another
$120 million. The rest is to come from private donations.
</P>
<P>
   The plans include an esplanade and a bicycle trail running
parallel to the riverbank. The parkland is to cover 550 acres. Of
that, about 400 acres is the part of the river that stretches
between the 13 piers on the West Side, and will be used for fishing
and boating. The remaining 125 acres includes the narrow strip of
land from Battery Park City to West 59th Street, as well as the
huge piers.

HATCHER, STARS' DEFENSE PLAN TO PLAY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MAC ENGEL 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ It wasn't Theisman-esque, but the sight
of Stars defenseman Derian Hatcher's right knee buckling on a hit
against New Jersey's Alexander Mogilny was chilling on slow-motion
replays.
</P>
<P>
   Hatcher hyperextended the knee on the third-period hit and did
not return. He plans to play for tonight's Game 2.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would almost guarantee it,'' Hatcher said. ``I haven't
skated yet. Last night it didn't get any worse, and usually, if
it's serious, throughout the course of a night it gets worse. So,
for the most part, it feels pretty good. I rode the bike a little
today and for the most part it feels pretty good, so I'm sure it
will feel good tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   While Hatcher says his right knee is OK, the rest of the team,
and defense, is still smarting after the Game 1 ambush, where they
surrendered seven goals, the total given up in their four previous
playoff games.
</P>
<P>
   Whether it was because of blown assignments, poor puck play or
poor positioning, the Stars' defensemen are convinced Game 2 will
not be a repeat of Game 1. Without making any major adjustments,
they are convinced they can contain a top line that scored 11
points and physically neutralize a team that skated and scored all
over them in Game 1.
</P>
<P>
   The defensive pair going against the Devils' top line of Jason
Arnott, Petr Sykora and Patrik Elias is expected to change. In Game
1, Darryl Sydor and Sergei Zubov went against that line, and it
finished with four goals.
</P>
<P>
   Hatcher and Richard Matvichuk expect to be going against that
line tonight.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hatcher and I have to take it as a personal challenge to shut
down those guys,'' Matvichuk said. ``Hopefully, starting
\Rtonight\S, we'll get what we want and that's to play against that
line knowing we've been pretty successful shutting down top
lines.''
</P>
<P>
   That leaves the rest of the Stars defensemen trying to contain
an offense that outshot them, 26-18. Considering that the Stars
have been outshot by wider margins this postseason, that's not too
alarming.
</P>
<P>
   What's more encouraging is the Stars' history of playing
physically more aggressive on the heels of a defeat. But against
the Devils, being more physical isn't always a matter of finishing
checks or hitting players. It's about being selectively physical.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a game where you are physical when you can be,'' Stars
defenseman Dave Manson said. ``You don't want to be out of position
to be physical, because then you end up getting that stuck right
back down your throat, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Tonight, the Stars are the ones expected to do the shoving down
throats. And the Devils know it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I expect a lot more from the next game,'' Devils defenseman
Scott Stevens said. ``We have to come out hard and go right after
them and put them back on their heels.''
</P>
<P>
   The Stars don't expect this. Precedent suggests they shouldn't.
They haven't lost consecutive games in the playoffs this season.
The last time they lost consecutive playoff games were Games 4 and
5 of the 1999 conference finals.
</P>
<P>
   ``\REverybody\S talks about how great we are after a loss,''
Matvichuk said. ``After the loss we took \RTuesday\S last night, we
better be great.''

DEVILS EXPECT COUNTERATTACK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By J. DOUGLAS FOSTER 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ Call it a hurricane. Maybe a typhoon.
Even an Avalanche, for a more fitting hockey reference.
</P>
<P>
   Some sort of natural disaster is likely the best analogy for
what most people following this year's Stanley Cup Finals expect
from the Stars in Game 2 tonight. After watching the speedy Devils
skate past the Stars repeatedly in a 7-3, Game 1 loss, odds are the
Stars will open with one of their most desperate and aggressive
first periods tonight at the Continental Airlines Arena.
</P>
<P>
   And nobody knows that better than the Devils.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they're probably a little ... embarrassed,'' New
Jersey center John Madden said. ``I would be. I think they'll come
out real hard in the first 10 minutes of the game. It will be
important for our team to rise to the challenge and weather the
storm. Those first 10 minutes will be vital.''
</P>
<P>
   Much has been made of the sound thrashing New Jersey gave the
Stars and goaltender Ed Belfour in Game 1, and rightfully so. The
Devils scored six goals in a little more than two periods, chasing
Belfour from the ice for backup Manny Fernandez before eventually
scoring on him as well.
</P>
<P>
   It's not supposed to be this way. The defending Stanley Cup
champions are supposed to embarrass others, not get embarrassed.
Dallas is supposed to grind and punish teams into submission, not
sit back and watch teams throw pucks past Belfour as if he were
woozy on cold medicine.
</P>
<P>
   But that's what happened. And expecting the same in Game 2 is
the last thing on New Jersey's minds.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are going to come out really angry and really hungry to
win that hockey game,'' Devils goaltender Martin Brodeur said.
``For us, we've got to make sure that we are really disciplined in
the early going of that game and make sure we stay physical and try
to make them think about Game 1 ... try to bury our chances when we
have them.''
</P>
<P>
   Staying disciplined amid Dallas' attempt to force its way back
into this series is extremely important. In Game 1 New Jersey
wasn't called for a penalty, and expectations are that the Stars
will try to create more special-teams chances by bringing more hits
and physical play to Game 2.
</P>
<P>
   What the Devils can't do, they said, is underestimate Dallas.
The Stars are, after all, the defending champions. And it's not
like this is new territory for coach Ken Hitchcock's bunch. Dallas
has lost the first road game in each of its three playoff series
this season only to emerge victorious. And in the past two seasons,
the Stars have lost Game 1 of both conference finals series and
both Stanley Cup Finals.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars won the first three series. The Devils know they can
still win the fourth in spite of Tuesday's score.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't matter whether we won 2-1, 7-3 or 4-3,'' Devils
center Bobby Holik said. ``Tomorrow it won't help us at all.
Nothing is going to help us but this team being ready to play like
we were.''

STARS HOPING TO PUT CLAMPS ON SPEEDIER DEVILS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CHAREAN WILLIAMS 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ The New Jersey Devils were quicker to
loose pucks, quicker up and down the ice and quicker out of the
gate in Game 1.
</P>
<P>
   That is why the Stars, who lost to the Devils, 7-3, on Tuesday
night, enter tonight's game playing catchup.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have quick forwards with a lot of speed,'' Stars center
Guy Carbonneau said. ``They like to control the flow of the game,
and that's exactly what we gave them \RTuesday\S night. We're known
as a team that plays tight defense and plays tight in the neutral
zone. \R Tuesday\S night, we didn't do that. We didn't start the
way we wanted to play, and they took advantage of all the
mistakes.''
</P>
<P>
   The Colorado Avalanche, which lost to the Stars in the Western
Conference Finals, are fast. The Devils are faster.
</P>
<P>
   As the Stars have discovered, speed can kill.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are a fast team, but they were opportunistic on the
chances they had,'' Stars defenseman Sylvain Cote said. ``We have
to have better positioning, no doubt.''
</P>
<P>
   Immediately after the game, coach Ken Hitchcock said his team
had ``struggled'' in its own end and blamed the Stars' mistakes on
the speed of the Devils' forwards. Less than 24 hours later,
Hitchcock was back-tracking.
</P>
<P>
   ``After the game, I kept thinking that they were coming at us,
coming at us,'' Hitchcock said, ``but then when I looked at the
tape \Ryesterday\S, the reason they were coming at us is because of
the mistakes that we were making that gave them that opportunity.
We were giving them odd-man rushes, because of us turning the puck
over.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think you negate speed by being better with the puck. You
can stand in position defensively all you want, but if you are not
good with the puck and you are not strong in those areas and
determined to get the job done, then you are going to constantly be
looking at speed coming at you. That is the area that has got to be
better for us.''
</P>
<P>
   The Stars said they aren't as slow as they looked. Instead, they
claim it was neutral-zone turnovers that helped the Devils get
ahead in a hurry.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've got speed, but we had so many puck mistakes that it
created a lot of opportunities for them,'' Stars defenseman Darryl
Sydor said. ``We've got to clean up our neutral-zone turnovers.''
</P>
<P>
   The Devils' first line of Jason Arnott, Petr Sykora and Patrik
Elias had four goals and seven assists. Either Sydor or his
defensive partner, Sergei Zubov, was on the ice for all of the
game's 10 goals.
</P>
<P>
   ``They really skate to the puck well down low,'' Sydor said.
``They've always got a guy in front, and they don't seem to look.
They just try and throw the puck in areas where they believe guys
are. When you play together for a while, you know where guys are
without even looking. That's what they're doing right now.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to stop their cycle. Obviously, you've got to pin
and seal. You've got to get the first guy stopped up and try to get
them not moving. We basically have to shut them down physically.''

STARS' HITCHCOCK MIGHT HAVE TO AD-LIB LINES FOR GAME 2
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JEFF CAPLAN 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ Jamie Langenbrunner remains a scratch.
Guy Carbonneau is grinding his teeth into sand for a crack at
checking the Devils' explosive top line. And Stars coach Ken
Hitchcock is giving the outside world _ and the Devils _ no
indication of how he will construct his lines for tonight's Game 2.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps because he isn't sure yet himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got our challenges,'' Hitchcock said the day after
adjusting and readjusting all four lines throughout the Stars' 7-3
loss in Game 1 of the Stanley Cup Finals. ``They \Rthe Devils\S
don't present anything different. I'm more concerned with the
challenges we're creating for ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   The Stars have become a 20-player jigsaw puzzle at the worst
time. Much of the shuffling in Game 1 was due to the Devils'
domination and Hitchcock's search for a spark.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes you try to shake up things,'' Carbonneau said.
</P>
<P>
   A major blow is the loss of Langenbrunner, who Hitchcock said
will not play in Game 2. As long as Langenbrunner, who has a
sprained knee, is out of the lineup, mixing and matching and
adjusting lines during the game could become a regular occurrence.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have time to experiment, we have to find the right
combinations for \Rtoday\S and throw them together,'' Stars forward
Kirk Muller said. ``Everyone has had lots of opportunities to play
with each over this year. More important is that we can play a
stronger game. We all know that.''
</P>
<P>
   Carbonneau wants the opportunity to battle Petr Sykora, Jason
Arnott and Patrik Elias, who combined for four goals and 11 points
in Game 1. With the Devils owning last change, they are able to
keep Carbonneau of that line much of the time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously,'' Carbonneau answered when asked if he wanted to go
head-to-head with the Devils' highly skilled line. ``It's tough on
the road, but I will when we go back to Dallas.''
</P>
<P>
   Langenbrunner's absence provides the biggest challenge in
constructing a potent second line. He and center Joe Nieuwendyk
seem to find instant chemistry on the ice together. With power
forward Scott Thornton opposite Langenbrunner, that line had hit a
groove. Since Langenbrunner went out in Game 5 against Colorado,
Nieuwendyk and Thornton have no points.
</P>
<P>
   The seriousness of Langenbrunner's knee sprain is beginning to
draw speculation. The Stars said they expected him back for Game 2,
but yesterday Hitchcock said Langenbrunner is not ready to play.
His absence for a fourth consecutive game sends shock waves through
the lines.
</P>
<P>
   Without Langenbrunner, Hitchcock said he prefers to insert
winger Jon Sim, who spent most of the season playing for the Stars'
minor-league affiliate, instead of checking forward Blake Sloan,
who spent most of the year on the checking line with Carbonneau and
Mike Keane. Aaron Gavey, who hasn't played since Game 3 of the
Western Conference Finals, is also a possibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it hurts us to a certain point,'' Keane said. ``Joe
and Jamie play very well together. It's something where whoever has
to play for Jamie has to play well. The first two lines are the
most important, three and four kind of work themselves out. You
want your best players playing on the No. 2 line.''

WELL-BALANCED PENN STATE NOT TO BE TAKEN LIGHTLY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By WHIT CANNING 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   As the sun rose over Upper Montclair, N.J., on Sunday, the Penn
State Nittany Lions were in a fix: To survive the Rutgers regional
and advance to the Super Regional round, they would have to beat
North Carolina ... twice.
</P>
<P>
   A daunting prospect, since at that moment they stood 0-3 on the
year against the Tar Heels, including two early-season losses and a
14-5 pasting in the regional opener.
</P>
<P>
   But just as gloom began to settle, the Lions suddenly received
the spark necessary to propel them to victory, helpfully provided
by the Tar Heels.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were taking us lightly, they only had to win once, and
they figured there wasn't going to be a second game,'' Penn State
pitcher Pete Yodis said. ``We heard they had tickets to the Yankees
game that night. That fired us up.''
</P>
<P>
   So the Nittany Lions _ playing in the NCAA regionals for the
first time since 1976 _ swept two from the Tar Heels and are on
their way to Austin, where they will face Texas at 7 p.m. tomorrow
at Disch-Falk Field in the opener of the best-of-three Super
Regional. The second game is scheduled for 7 p.m. Saturday and the
third game, if necessary, for 2 p.m. Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The Lions come well-armed and powerful.
</P>
<P>
   Penn State (45-17) is hitting .344 as a team after closing the
regular season at .358, best in the nation. ]Leading the way is
outfielder Michael Campo _ a recent first-team All-America
selection _ who carries a .439 average and a 41-game hitting
streak. On the power side, there is third baseman Shawn Fagan, with
15 home runs and 80 runs batted in. Eleven players are hitting more
than .300, including eight regulars.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've hit well,'' coach Joe Hindelang said, ``but I'm really
more proud of what we've done on defense _ we're at .970, and
that's been a big factor. Sometimes your hitting goes south on you,
but the way you win is with solid defense and pitching.''
</P>
<P>
   While Penn State's pitching (4.63 team earned-run average) is
far less gaudy than that of the Longhorns (3.18), the Lions have
had their moments recently and boasts a key strength _ depth _ that
was evident Sunday against North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   ``North Carolina used Eric Henderson, one of their big starters
in the first game, but after we knocked him out, the game began to
turn in our favor and we won, 6-5,'' Yodis said. ``They had no one
left and used their closer to start the second game, and we won,
10-3.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Penn State had an unsung ace in the hole _ freshman
Kevin Damiano, who had pitched 19 innings all season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We went to the pitching coach,'' catcher Joe Puliafico said,
``and pointed out that we had some fresh arms that hadn't thrown
lately, and we should use them instead of the guys we'd been
pitching all weekend.''
</P>
<P>
   So Damiano became the hero _ closing the first game and starting
the second _ pitching a total of nine innings and picking up both
victories. He even survived a piece of backfired strategy straight
out of ``Bull Durham''.
</P>
<P>
   ``After he looked so strong finishing the first game, we decided
to start him in the second while he was still warmed up,''
Puliafico said. ``It seemed like he finally began to lose some
steam in the fifth, so I went to the mound and I said, `Just make
sure you don't walk this guy ... Throw it over the plate _ I don't
care if he hits a home run.'
</P>
<P>
   ``So Kevin throws a changeup and the guy hits a home run.''
</P>
<P>
   Lately, it seems, the Nittany Lions can overcome anything. This
weekend they'll be asked to overcome the loss of their coach, who
will not make the trip. Hindelang was admitted to Hershey (Pa.)
Medical Center yesterday with acute chest pains and is being held
for more observation.
</P>
<P>
   Last weekend, Penn State overcame the loss of three starters,
catcher Chris Netwall (ankle), first baseman Chris Wright
(mononucleosis) and shortstop John Richmond (stiff neck), to move
on. Penn State officials are hoping all three will be ready this
weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Puliafico likes his team's chances.
</P>
<P>
   ``I figure there's no pressure on us ... we're lovin' it,'' he
said.

SIERRA HAS A CHANCE _ SOMEWHERE ELSE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By T.R. SULLIVAN 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ Ruben Sierra could be returning to the major leagues
soon. It probably won't be with the Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   General manager Doug Melvin said yesterday he is getting
inquiries about the Rangers' former superstar, who is showing signs
of a comeback at Triple-A Oklahoma after his career was all but
extinguished.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had a couple teams talk to me about him,'' Melvin said.
``There's a little interest. He's proven he could play at that
level. He could be a productive part-time player for somebody.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the Rangers, Melvin said, ``I don't think he would be a
fit for us at this time, not unless we had a bunch of injuries.''
</P>
<P>
   Sierra,, going into last night's game, was hitting .356 in 27
games with 22 runs scored, five home runs and 20 runs batted in.
His defense still isn't the best but Melvin said, ``That's not
what's going to get him to the big leagues.''
</P>
<P>
   Sierra, 35, was once considered one of the best to play for the
Rangers. He finished second to Milwaukee Brewers Hall of Famer
Robin Yount in the 1989 American League Most Valuable Player
balloting after hitting .306 with 29 home runs and a league-leading
119 RBI. But he was traded to the Oakland Athletics on Aug. 31,
1992, and his career steadily declined.
</P>
<P>
   He attributed his decline to doing too much weightlifting that
ruined his swing. But he said he has stopped that and recently told
the /Daily Oklahoman/, ``I've finally come back to swinging the bat
like I used to. I feel much better now. I know I don't need to lift
weights because I can hit the ball out of the ballpark without
lifting weights.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers, with Gabe Kapler out until early next week with a
strained hip flexor, could have used help in right field the past
month. Chad Curtis is playing there but the Rangers' right fielders
have combined to hit .198 this season with six home runs and 24
RBI. That's the lowest batting average at the position for any
American League team.
</P>
<P>
   Scarborough Green and Jason McDonald were sharing the position
before Curtis moved over from left field, when Rusty Greer came off
the disabled list. They remain on the team as reserves, and Melvin
said the Rangers still prefer what they have on the roster over
Sierra.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're a better fit for us because of their speed and
defense,'' Melvin said. ``They both play good defense and we
probably have a need for somebody to pinch run more than anything.
Our offense has been good enough where I don't see Ruben being a
good fit.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers also have roster concerns. Both McDonald and Green
are out of options, meaning they would have to go through outright
waivers before being sent to the minor leagues and could be claimed
by another team. One of them will have to go through waivers when
Kapler comes back. The Rangers don't want to risk losing both by
experimenting with Sierra.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to get Gabe back, have Chad as our fourth outfielder
and have the guys we had at the start of the year,'' Melvin said.
``Then we'd probably make a decision between Green and McDonald.''

   ``As time goes by, more clubs will be calling,'' Melvin said.
``I've been asked about him. One of the problems clubs are having
is they have so many injuries, they're starting to look at Triple A
for help. It looks like he's still able to hit and may have
something left. I won't stand in his way.''

RODRIGUEZ TOPS AL VOTING
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ The drama is over. It usually is when the first
release of the All-Star voting is announced. Rangers catcher Ivan
Rodriguez is headed toward his ninth consecutive All-Star Game and
his eighth consecutive starting assignment.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez led all American League players regardless of position
with 455,486 votes, more than twice as many as his nearest
competitor at catcher. That would be Jorge Posada of the Yankees,
who has received 201,665 votes in the first voting release
announced yesterday. Cleveland Indians second baseman Roberto
Alomar is second among all American League players with 386,062
votes.
</P>
<P>
   From the Rangers, Rafael Palmeiro was fifth among first basemen
and second baseman Luis Alicea and shortstop Royce Clayton were
ninth at their positions. No Rangers outfielders were listed in the
top 20. Detroit's Juan Gonzalez is 12th, far behind the three
leaders, Kansas City's Jermaine Dye, New York's Bernie Williams and
Cleveland's Manny Ramirez.
</P>
<P>
   All-Star voting continues through June 25. The starting teams
for both leagues will be announced July 4. The pitchers and
reserves will be announced July 5.  &QL; 
Gonzalez needs MRI
</P>
<P>
   Juan Gonzalez was not in the Tigers' starting lineup last night
and is scheduled to undergo an MRI exam on the strained tendon in
his left heel today. The Tigers are concerned because the swelling
hasn't gone down, and Gonzalez is still in considerable pain. The
disabled list is a possibility.  &QL; 
Kapler getting close
</P>
<P>
   Outfielder Gabe Kapler, on the disabled list with a strained hip
flexor, could be activated by the Rangers on the upcoming
homestand, probably either Sunday or Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Kapler tested the injury yesterday afternoon by running the
bases and said he only felt the injury once. He is planning to take
today off, then run the bases again tomorrow at The Ballpark in
Arlington. If that goes well, he could be sent out on a second
medical rehabilitation assignment on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   That may be just a one- or two-game assignment but both Kapler
and the Rangers want to make sure he is healthy before he is
activated. He reinjured the muscle in his last rehabilitation
assignment, which further delayed his return.
</P>
<P>
   Kapler said yesterday, ``The muscle was as good or better than
the first time I went out on assignment. But I'm not going to
\Rreinjure it\S again. I'm going to be smart about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Kapler has been on the disabled list since May 2 after suffering
the injury running the bases during a game against the Tampa Bay
Devil Rays.  &QL; 
Minor-league notes
</P>
<P>
   Cuban refugee//second baseman Jorge ``Spider'' Diaz has been
activated and assigned to Class-A Port Charlotte.
</P>
<P>
   Savannah (Ga.) SandGnats infielder Hank Blalock and pitcher Matt
Kosderka have been selected to the South Atlantic League Southern
Division All-Star team.
</P>
<P>
   Double-A Tulsa first baseman Carlos Pena continues to thrive in
the Texas League. Pena, the Rangers' No. 1 pick in 1998, is hitting
.335 (10th in the league) with 15 home runs (third) and 57 RBI
(second).  &QL; 
Briefly
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers are expected to eclipse the 1 million mark in
attendance during tomorrow's game against the Arizona Diamondbacks.
The Rangers are 27,356 fans shy of the mark.
</P>
<P>
   Pitcher Mike Munoz, on the disabled list with tendinitis in his
left elbow, is scheduled to pitch batting practice for the first
time tomorrow. Trainer Danny Wheat said Munoz would probably throw
batting practice two or three times during the six-game homestand,
then possibly go out on medical rehabilitation assignment while the
club is on the next road trip to Colorado, Baltimore and Tampa Bay.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers have a day off today, one of 11 scheduled before the
All-Star break. They have just six scheduled after the break and
one is being used to make up the April 11 rainout with the New York
Yankees. Said manager Johnny Oates, ``I wish the off-days were more
evenly spread throughout the schedule.''

TOUR BUS WORKERS SHOCKED AT SUDDEN JOB LOSS 
</HEADLINE>
   By JUAN FORERO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ They knew their company had been under intense
scrutiny, but employees of New York Apple Tours still shook their
heads in disbelief Wednesday after hearing that the state had
ordered the operator's double-decker buses off the streets.
</P>
<P>
   Some workers quietly agreed that the city had a right to
investigate the company's environmental and safety record,
especially after a pedestrian was struck and killed by an Apple
Tours bus last week. But they wondered if the state might have had
other options. Without a job, the workers asked, how would they
feed their children and pay their bills?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very surprised,'' said Amadou Sabi, 45, an employee of
Apple Tours for eight years, moments after hearing the news
Wednesday afternoon when he arrived at the company's visitor center
at Eighth Avenue and 48th Street
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought they were going to give us some time,'' said Sabi,
who was a ticket seller. ``I don't know what to do. I have a wife,
two kids, a family to support.''
</P>
<P>
   Maria Martin, 35, who also sold tickets and had been with the
company five years, said she felt like a member of her family had
died. ``I love the work and I love the family,'' she said. ``It's
hard.''
</P>
<P>
   The temporary shutdown order was also hard on hundreds of
tourists who had bought tickets for a tour of Manhattan aboard
Apple Tours' red buses Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Brenda Field, a visitor from Australia, said she had ridden one
block aboard a bus when a guide said about 1:30 p.m. that the tour
was over. ``Sorry, folks, but we've been closed down,'' the guide
told the bus of tourists, Field said,
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very angry,'' said Field, who arrived in New York with her
husband. ``This is our first day here and this is what we're
confronted with.''
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of tourists demanded refunds and stormed off after Apple
Tours employees told them none would be given. Later in the
afternoon, other tourists were told their tickets would be honored
by Apple Tours' competitors, Gray Line and New York Double-Decker.
</P>
<P>
   Craig P. Heard, president of New York Double-Decker, confirmed
that his company would accept Apple Tours tickets. Lee Gelber,
manager of tour services for Gray Line, said the company would
honor tickets bought from tourism companies that do business with
Gray Line. But he said his company would not accept tickets bought
from other operators or directly from Apple Tours.
</P>
<P>
   ``Apple has collected all the money, and there's no way they're
going to pay it to us, not that we can envision,'' Gelber said.
</P>
<P>
   The 300 workers of Apple Tours, meanwhile, passionately defended
the right of their company to operate. By evening, dozens had
gathered in front of the visitors center, saying the city's charges
were ``bogus'' and a ``set-up.''
</P>
<P>
   A tour guide, Eva Lee, screamed that the company was being
unfairly maligned.
</P>
<P>
   In private conversations throughout the afternoon, some workers
were more circumspect.
</P>
<P>
   ``They should put restrictions on us if they want, more point
checks, but they shouldn't shut us down,'' said Juan Gonzalez, a
dispatcher and a five-year veteran of Apple Tours.
</P>
<P>
   Lorenzo Smith, 23, a driver who said he was ticketed last week
for driving a bus without the proper license, said the temporary
shutdown was probably a good thing for him. ``This is what I needed
to get out of here,'' he said. ``I needed a little more stability,
and this company wasn't doing it for me.''

BUSH FAVORS DELAYING INMATE'S EXECUTION FOR DNA TEST 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Editors: resend for all needing) 
 
 
By JOHN W. GONZALEZ 
and EVAN MOORE 
c.2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ In a case involving DNA evidence, Gov. George W.
Bush said Wednesday he would delay an inmate's execution Thursday
if the courts don't step in to block it.
</P>
<P>
   The 30-day reprieve, which only the governor can issue, would be
Bush's first during his five years in office.
</P>
<P>
   And, in a second case involving DNA evidence, Bush on Wednesday
issued a rare pardon to a Tyler man who served 17 years in prison
for a rape that DNA testing proved he did not commit.
</P>
<P>
   A reprieve would allow sophisticated new DNA tests on crucial
evidence in the 1993 rape and murder case of Ricky Nolen McGinn of
Brown County. With Bush and Lt. Gov. Rick Perry out of state
Thursday, the relief for McGinn could only be issued by the acting
governor, state Sen. Rodney Ellis, D-Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said his staff informed Ellis that if other last-minute
legal appeals don't stall the execution, the governor expects Ellis
to carry out his wishes. A final petition is pending in the 5th
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they (courts) don't cause the DNA to be reviewed, I'm more
than likely to grant the 30-day reprieve,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's pardon for 46-year-old A.B. Butler came three weeks after
the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles recommended it. Butler was
convicted of the kidnapping and rape of a 25-year-old woman in 1983
and given two, concurrent 99-year sentences.
</P>
<P>
   Butler is the third Texas convict to be freed as a result of DNA
findings. The other two also went to inmates exonerated by DNA
testing. Kevin Byrd of Houston spent 12 years in prison before
being freed in 1997. Ben Salazar of Austin was freed while serving
a 30-year sentence for a 1992 rape.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has issued 15 pardons since he took office in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Butler began seeking a DNA comparison in 1987 and eventually
contacted Houston attorney Randy Schaffer, who obtained court
orders for the tests.
</P>
<P>
   Schaffer had one test conducted that proved inconclusive. A
second test, however, showed Butler was not the rapist and Schaffer
began requesting a hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Schaffer eventually was granted a hearing on that test by state
District Judge Cynthia Kent and, on Jan. 7, Butler was released on
bail.
</P>
<P>
   Both Schaffer and Smith County District Attorney Jack Skeen
joined in requesting a pardon.
</P>
<P>
   Kent, however, ordered a new trial. Schaffer said Wednesday's
pardon negates that order.
</P>
<P>
   Bush agreed to the pardon because the case met his requirement
that such test results be reviewed by the prosecution, defense
attorneys, trial judge and the court of criminal appeals and all
agree that the test constitutes valid new evidence of innocence.
</P>
<P>
   The pardon makes Butler eligible for $25,000 from a state fund
in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, in New Mexico campaigning for the Republican presidential
nomination, issued a statement saying ``all the parties concluded
that the test results constituted new, valid evidence of Mr.
Butler's innocence when reviewed in context with other evidence in
the case.''
</P>
<P>
   In comments recorded for MSNBC-TV's ``Hardball'' program, Bush
said the DNA retesting in McGinn's case was unlikely to offset
evidence that he committed the murder, though it might prove he
didn't rape the victim, Stephanie Rae Flanary, his 12-year-old
stepdaughter. If exonerated of the rape, McGinn would not be
executed but would remain behind bars for murder, Bush noted.
</P>
<P>
   ``My attitude is, if there's any doubt, we ought to be looking
at that evidence. If there's any doubt as to whether or not he
committed the rape, that evidence ought to be reviewed,'' Bush
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll see what the courts say and see what the Board of
Pardons and Paroles says. And then I'll make up my mind,'' Bush
said. ``I want to make sure the man has his full day in court.''
</P>
<P>
   While Bush made those comments, the parole board voted
overwhelmingly against McGinn's requests for a 30-day reprieve and
commutation of his death sentence. Parole board chairman Gerald
Garrett said the board voted 18-0 against recommending to Bush that
he commute the death sentence to a lesser penalty. They split 11-7
against the reprieve, Garrett said.
</P>
<P>
   ``None of the members had any doubt as to his guilt. The facts
that are before us at this time clearly indicate that he's
guilty,'' Garrett said. He was referring to blood and hair evidence
that prosecution experts said tied McGinn to the slaying.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. McGinn and his supporters, at the 11th hour, introduced a
new issue and I believe the membership took a close look at that,''
Garrett said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The board has rendered its decision on this matter, so that
leaves the governor only the option of granting a one-time, 30-day
reprieve,'' Garrett noted.
</P>
<P>
   If Ellis grants the reprieve that Bush favors, McGinn can prove
or disprove his culpability in the rape and murder, one of his
lawyers said. Specifically, the defense teams want to conduct new
types of tests on semen stains found on the victim's clothes and on
a pubic hair _ previously identified as probably from McGinn _
found on the girl's body.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney Barry Scheck, the DNA expert who defended O.J. Simpson,
derided as ``junk science'' the microscopic hair comparisons
conducted on the pubic hair. He said Bush should grant the reprieve
as ``a matter of common sense and basic decency.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see how anybody could oppose this. Not only could we
prevent the execution of somebody who might be innocent, but it
could also lead to the apprehension of the real perpetrator,''
Scheck said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Out of the 72 post-conviction DNA exonerations in North
America, 16 times it has led to the identification of the real
perpetrator, and that's going to happen more and more with these
DNA databases,'' Scheck said.
</P>
<P>
   But on Fox News, McGinn's prosecutor said further DNA testing is
unnecessary and wasn't sought on a timely basis.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point, unlike before the trial, Mr. McGinn is not
presumed to be innocent but is in fact presumed to be guilty
because that's what a jury found,'' said Brown County District
Attorney Lee Haney of Brownwood.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even this evidence would not overcome the tremendous amount of
other evidence that was involved at the trial. ... There's DNA
evidence, scientific evidence and circumstantial evidence tying him
to the murder of this young girl,'' Haney said.

DOW JONES CRITICIZES CORPORATE NEWS PROPOSAL
</HEADLINE>
 By FELICITY BARRINGE R  
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Dow Jones &AMP; Co. has complained to the Securities and
Exchange Commission that a proposed rule intended to prevent
companies from giving information to a hand-picked group of
investors would result in ``less informative, less objective and
less timely reporting.''
</P>
<P>
   Unless the proposal is amended, wrote Peter G. Skinner,
executive vice president and general counsel of the company that
owns The Wall Street Journal, Barron's and Dow Jones Newswires, it
could increase timidity among executives afraid of running afoul of
the rule, and end up ``choking the flow'' of information.
</P>
<P>
   The SEC proposed the rule in December, after the issue had been
championed for months by the commission's chairman, Arthur Levitt.
In a speech in October, Levitt said: ``The behind-the-scenes
feeding of material nonpublic information from companies to
analysts is a stain on our markets. In a time when instantaneous
and free-flowing information is the norm, these sort of whispers
are an insult to fair and public disclosure.''
</P>
<P>
   The Journal's opposition highlights the increasing scrutiny
given to how, and to whom, companies provide information in an era
when new technologies and hair-trigger markets have made
information a more valuable and sensitive commodity.
</P>
<P>
   The view that the proposed rule could have the unintended
consequence of restricting the flow of financial information,
however, is hardly universal. While critical comments were filed by
Dow Jones and some members of the Society of American Business
Editors and Writers, other news organizations largely remained
silent.
</P>
<P>
   Bloomberg News, a financial service that is a competitor of Dow
Jones', published a news report on Wednesday highlighting its
rival's decision to criticize the proposed rule. Dow Jones,
Bloomberg reported, was arguing that the proposal ``could dry up
scoops at its flagship Wall Street Journal newspaper.''
</P>
<P>
   Matt Winkler, Bloomberg's editor in chief, said: ``There isn't a
great story that has come from a handout. Ever.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``The best stories come from good old-fashioned
enterprise. I say that as a former Wall Street Journal reporter. I
don't understand what the fuss is about.''
</P>
<P>
   Dow Jones' comments, filed as the designated period for reaction
was ending last month, sought to make the proposed rule
inapplicable to information released ``to bona fide news
organizations.''
</P>
<P>
   Financial journalists are not the only group split on the
proposal, which is in general disfavor with most analysts but
appears quite popular among small investors, whose numbers have
expanded exponentially.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel J. Kramer, a partner at the law firm of Schulte Roth &AMP;
Zabel, says he believes that the key question in analyzing the new
rules is ``whether they will result in an information brownout, and
result in less information being available to the public rather
than more.''
</P>
<P>
   The high profile given to the practice of selective disclosure,
however, has had some impact. A 1998 study by the National
Investors Relations Institute, cited by Kramer, found that while
the majority of the 163 companies surveyed preferred to discuss new
information with analysts on conference calls, 29 percent invited
individual shareholders, and 14 percent invited the media.
</P>
<P>
   Three months ago, a report from the investor relations' group
showed that 82 percent of companies let individual investors in on
their conference calls and 74 percent let journalists participate.

MOTHER'S ABUSE OF BABY IN '86 MAY BE LINKED TO HIS DEATH THIS
YEAR 
</HEADLINE>
   By C.J. CHIVERS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The authorities said Wednesday that they were
considering filing manslaughter or perhaps murder charges against a
Queens woman whose son died this spring from injuries she inflicted
on him 14 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The case is an extremely rare instance in which a long-ago
assault becomes fodder for a homicide investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The city medical examiner said Wednesday that Joshua Slaughter,
14, died on April 11 from complications related to injuries he
received during his first weeks of life, when his mother, Mitzi
Slaughter, aggressively shook him in their home in Jamaica, Queens.
Because of the shaking, police said, the boy suffered a brain
injury, developed cerebral palsy and required continuous care.
</P>
<P>
   Mitzi Slaughter, now 36, pleaded guilty in 1988 to second-degree
assault and endangering the welfare of a child. She was sentenced
to six months in prison and five years' probation, and lost custody
of her son. She appeared to have fully served her sentence for a
crime she committed as a young mother.
</P>
<P>
   But the case against her was revived last week when the medical
examiner, after rounds of tests, determined that Joshua died of
bronchial pneumonia, blood poisoning and neurological disorders
related to shaken-baby syndrome. ``The complications that occurred
are a consequence of the shaking that occurred in 1986,'' said
Ellen S. Borakove, the medical examiner's spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   Slaughter was being questioned Wednesday night by investigators
at the 103rd Precinct in Jamaica, where the authorities said they
were considering filing fresh charges against her. ``We're
conferring with the Queens district attorney to determine
charges,'' said Sgt. Brian Burke, a police spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   The state's criminal procedure law allows for renewed
prosecution of assault cases when injuries received in the assault
later cause the victim's death. Mary DeBourbon, a spokeswoman for
the Queens County district attorney, said that if the investigation
found grounds, the prosecutors could file charges.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``It's not impossible,'' she said. ``It's legally permissible.''
</P>
<P>
   But DeBourbon also said Wednesday that prosecutors were still
gathering records from the 1986 case and had not reached a
decision. Slaughter's circumstance is rare but not unprecedented.
In a similar case last year, the Bronx district attorney, Robert
Johnson, considered but ultimately declined the bringing of new
charges against a woman who attacked Rodney Irby, a Bronx man who
died 25 years after being shot and stabbed in a dispute over drugs
in the South Bronx. Irby was left a paraplegic by the assault.
</P>
<P>
   The authorities said the attack against Joshua Slaughter had
caused brain injuries and palsy disabling enough to eventually
require institutionalization. Cerebral palsy is a chronic condition
affecting body movement and muscle development. Most cases are
caused by damage to a fetus' brain, but injuries to an infant's
developing brain _ like those from violent shaking _ can also cause
the condition, the authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer Banks, a spokeswoman for the Administration for
Children's Services, said that Slaughter had lost custody of Joshua
after she attacked him. The boy was placed in foster care and under
the administration's supervision from 1986 to 1997. During that
time, Slaughter remained in contact with her son and sometimes
spent time with him. ``The record indicates that the mom did visit
periodically,'' Banks said.
</P>
<P>
   She said that in 1997, the agency had transferred Joshua to an
institution run by the city's Department of Mental Health. The boy
also received treatment from the United Cerebral Palsy center in
Queens.
</P>
<P>
   Police said Wednesday that on the evening of April 11 Joshua was
taken to Mary Immaculate Hospital from the United Cerebral Palsy
center at 110-35 164th Place in Queens. He died shortly after
arriving.
</P>
<P>
   United Cerebral Palsy declined to comment Wednesday. A spokesman
for the city's Department of Health, reached late in the day, said
the agency was unable to immediately locate records on Joshua 's
case.

INSTEAD OF ATTACKING HIS FOE, GORE TALKS OF FAMILY MENTAL HEALTH
ISSUES 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By BENNETT ROTH 
c.2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHEVY CHASE, Md. _ With his wife, Tipper, by his side, Al Gore
spent Wednesday morning in a suburban Washington community center
sharing his family experiences with mental illness and his ideas on
how the federal government can better guarantee treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Absent from the vice president's address to the roomful of
mental health experts and advocates was his standard denunciation
of Republican presidential candidate George W. Bush's record on the
issue in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Gore related to the crowd how much he learned from
Tipper, who has acknowledged being treated for clinical depression
after their son, Albert III, was hit by a car in 1989. He had a
lengthy but complete recovery from his injuries.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mental illness is nothing to be ashamed of,'' the Democratic
presidential candidate said. ``But stigma and discrimination shame
us all.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore proposed requiring insurance companies to cover mental
health services for children in the same way they cover other
health benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to the softer side of Al Gore. After weeks of playing
the attack dog, the vice president has decided to ease up and talk
more about his own life experiences to show voters he relates to
the family issues they face.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week he spoke to veterans about his experience in
Vietnam and how it made him understand the problems of military
families.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday evening he scheduled a town hall style meeting in
Macon, Ga. Thursday he travels to Emory University Medical Center
in Atlanta to talk about protecting privacy and treatment rights of
cancer patients. Gore's sister, Nancy, died of lung cancer in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   And on Friday he will talk about fatherhood and the need to
fine-tune welfare reform to ensure that men play a greater role in
raising their children.
</P>
<P>
   The latest campaign strategy appears aimed at improving his
image among voters, who find Bush more likable than the vice
president, according to polls. Indeed, as Gore has escalated his
attacks on the Texas governor over the past few months he has
slipped behind Bush in the polls.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is clear the more he attacks Bush the more reactive and
negative he looks and therefore less presidential,'' said political
analyst Stuart Rothenberg. ``He wants to get rid of the petty
politics.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore's latest tack may be aimed at gaining an advantage among
women voters, who traditionally have been Democrats' strongest
supporters but who have been drawn to Bush's emphasis on education.
Polls show women split among the two candidates while men heavily
favor Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Even as Gore takes a break from blasting Bush, he is still
relying on his campaign and surrogates to keep up the fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is not going to be a retreat in discussing his mess in
Texas,'' said Gore campaign spokesman Chris Lehane.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, when Gore received the endorsement of the
League of Conservation Voters, he left it to the environmental
group's president, Deb Callahan, to criticize Bush's record on
pollution in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   And a Gore campaign aide referred reporters to Sen. John Kerry,
D-Mass., for comment on recent allegations that Bush did not report
for training for a year during his Texas Air National Guard service
in the early 1970s. Bush says he fulfilled all of his training
requirements.
</P>
<P>
   Bush campaign spokesman Scott McLellan scoffed at Gore's newest
campaign shift. ``How many times is the vice president allowed to
reinvent himself?'' McClellan asked. ``Al Gore's latest strategy is
to hide behind his surrogates.''
</P>
<P>
   However, in using others to assault his opponent, Gore appears
to be taking a page out of Bush's playbook. For the most part the
governor has chosen to take the high road while leaving the
attacking to others, including members of Congress, the Republican
National Committee, and conservative political groups.

   INQUIRING MINDS WANT TO KNOW
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-two Senate Democrats jumped into the debate over Social
Security Wednesday, writing to Gov. George W. Bush of Texas for
more details on his proposal to create individual investment
accounts ``so that the American public, elected officials and other
policy-makers can evaluate your proposal.''
</P>
<P>
   The letter, circulated by Sens. Charles Schumer of New York and
Byron Dorgan of North Dakota, asked questions intended to show some
of the hard choices that might be involved in reshaping the
retirement system. Among them: Would the government do anything to
limit investment choices to minimize risk? Would the proposal cut
Social Security benefits? Would the cuts have a disproportionate
impact on women?
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel strongly that as we debate any change to our Social
Security system, the public needs the full details of any
proposals,'' the Democrats wrote. Ari Fleischer, Bush's spokesman,
said Bush welcomed bipartisan input and supported a proposal by a
bipartisan group of senators to have a commission study changes to
the retirement system.
</P>
<P>
   KNOWING NOTHING, TELLING ALL
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George W. Bush often revels in not being a know-it-all, but
when Gov. Gary Johnson of New Mexico tried to join in that
celebration on Wednesday, he may well have taken it just a tad too
far.  &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; ``I'll tell you a story,'' Johnson said to scores of people who
had turned out to meet Bush in Albuquerque. ``At one of these
governors' conferences, George turns to me and says, `What are they
talking about?' I said, `I don't know.' He said, `You don't know a
thing, do you?' And I said, `Not one thing.' He said, `Neither do
I.' And we kind of high-fived. And my point here is _ is that _
when it comes to politics, it's really hard to find somebody who
will rather admit _ or rather talk about _ the things they don't
know and make that really evident.'' Bush has certainly been known
to do that.  &UR;  &LR; DELIVERING VENOM
</P>
<P>
   Bob Mulholland, a consultant to the California Democratic Party,
is celebrated for his unsparing verbal assaults on Republicans. But
last week, in a gesture that seemed over the top even for him, he
sent former Speaker Newt Gingrich and his fiancee, Callista Bisek,
a $12 gift from their online wedding registry at Williams-Sonoma: a
half-dozen dish towels and a cheery note.
</P>
<P>
   ``Newt: Here's a set of dishcloths to clean up the mess with
your second wife,'' Mulholland wrote, adding: ``Callista: In 5
years he'll be w/another younger woman. That's his pattern.'' That
was too much for the California Republican chairman, John McGraw,
who issued a statement calling on the state Democratic chairman,
Art Torres, to dismiss Mulholland, and sent along a can of Lysol to
disinfect Mulholland's office. ``Your flunky's latest despicable,
hate-filled act of venom sinks lower than a snake's belly in Death
Valley,'' McGraw wrote. Mulholland was unfazed. ``I'm happy to see
the California Republicans defending Newt Gingrich,'' he said.
``This man is despicable. He owes an apology to the American people
for attacking Bill Clinton while he was carrying on his own
affair.'' &QL;

EDITORIAL OBSERVER: REPUBLICANS FIND COMFORT WITH RICK LAZIO 
</HEADLINE>
   By ELEANOR RANDOLPH   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The dominant emotion at this week's New York State Republican
convention was relief that Rep. Rick Lazio has stepped in to
replace Mayor Rudolph Giuliani as the party's Senate nominee.
Sometimes this relief was unspoken, but in a surprising number of
cases, top Republicans expressed it openly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can tell you there was a lot of nervousness two weeks ago,''
said Georgette Mosbacher, a prominent fund-raiser. ``Under
everyone's breath we were saying, my God, can Rick raise the money?
Are we too late? But no, the segue from Rudy to Rick was absolutely
seamless.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, maybe not absolutely seamless. In a hastily scripted
two-hour event there were enough miscues to remind most seasoned
viewers that this was a campaign still suffering through its
toddler stage. The text of the speech handed out to the media, for
example, was still titled ``Draft 13.'' The unlucky rewrite
contained stage directions for how Lazio was to punctuate a story
about learning the value of labor from his father, who made the boy
earn money for a baseball glove by working in the family store.
``At pretty low wages, I remember,'' the text read, then added in
parentheses, ``(Smile).'' Lazio did.
</P>
<P>
   The candidate's boyish smile, of course, was a bit lopsided
after the fall on Monday that left him with a stitched lip. He
probably won some points for campaigning gamely along, but a more
seasoned staff would have thought to reposition the media platforms
so that the cameras were not forced to focus on the swollen side of
the candidate's face. And when Lazio's speech strayed past 5 p.m.,
he was suddenly competing with seven television personalities
brazenly doing their live stand-ups so loudly that it became
difficult to hear the candidate.
</P>
<P>
   These are the kinds of rough spots that political reporters are
trained to notice and the party faithful are conditioned to ignore.
In the main, you could feel the 2,000 Republican leaders gathered
in Buffalo settling into their comfort zone, sighing about how
scrubbed and energetic their candidate is, how clean-cut he is, how
home-grown. In fact, the whole idea of Lazio's nomination seemed to
be that he is the only insider here, the outsider being Hillary
Rodham Clinton, who moved to Westchester County last year from the
White House.
</P>
<P>
   The Erie County executive, Joel Giambra, fed the party line by
noting that it was time to elect a senator who ``played little
league football in this state.'' A colleague offered the contrast
that Lazio has paid taxes in New York state for many years. And
Gov. George Pataki summed it up by saying, ``Rick Lazio is one of
us.''
</P>
<P>
   Such was the zeal to embrace the carpetbagger strategy that no
one seemed to consider that ``one of us'' can be a loaded political
message, especially coming from a convention that had about as many
blacks and Hispanics as your average private golf club. More
important for Lazio, there are a lot of voters in New York state
who may not be as new to the state as Clinton but still do not
qualify as ``one of'' a party that has already maxed out its
support among white suburbanites.
</P>
<P>
   Even some Republicans, like Giuliani, do not fit easily in this
upstate conservative clubhouse. The mayor, who had the good sense
not to appear in Buffalo and muddy Lazio's message, is still known
in this crowd as the man who endorsed Mario Cuomo. That Giuliani is
allowed to call himself a Republican is a source of amazement to
some GOP insiders, not a few of whom work for Pataki.
</P>
<P>
   The Giuliani departure clearly pleased some on the Pataki team,
but it also sets up a key test of the governor's power. If Rudy
Giuliani ran against the first lady and lost, Pataki could shrug it
off as the mayor's problem, not his or the party's. If Lazio loses,
some of the blame will settle on his coach in the governor's office
and on this convention's us-versus-them message.
</P>
<P>
   For the moment, though, Republicans seem united in celebrating a
candidate who is not only the anti-Hillary but also the non-Rudy.
The GOP leadership is betting that as a candidate who lacks the
polarizing features of both Clinton and Giuliani, Lazio can command
broad if bland swatches of the middle ground. Hence the
concentrated effort by so many speakers to depict the first lady as
an invading Nurse Ratched. That may work, but a campaign to make
Clinton into a fearsome outsider could also turn Rick Lazio into
Ricky Nelson. In such a match, some of those swing voters might
wind up going for the more forceful character after all.

CLINTON VOWS TO SHARE ANTI-MISSILE TECHNOLOGY 
 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By CRAGG HINES 
c.2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LISBON, Portugal _ President Clinton pledged Wednesday to make
any U.S. missile-defense technology available to allies, including
Russia, and held out the prospect of unexpected progress on arms
control when he meets President Vladimir Putin this weekend in
Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, in the first news conference of his weeklong European
trip, said it would be ``unethical'' to withhold effective
anti-missile know-how from any allies working to stem nuclear
weaponry, including America's old Cold War adversary.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who has set a midsummer deadline for deciding on
whether to go ahead with the anti-missile system, said the United
States has ``done a lot of information-sharing already with the
Russians.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think that we could ever advance the notion that we
have this technology designed to protect us against a new threat
... and not make it available to them,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic president seemed to be moving toward the position
taken recently by Texas Gov. George W. Bush, the presumptive
Republican presidential nominee, but top Clinton aides resisted
that interpretation.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's always been my position,'' Clinton said, a sentiment
echoed by White House spokesman Joe Lockhart in a subsequent
briefing.
</P>
<P>
   However, last month, after Bush said ``a missile defense system
should not only defend our country, it should defend our allies,''
Lockhart told a White House briefing, ``We have a difference.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We are pursuing a policy of a limited, 50-state national
missile defense to protect against the emerging states like Korea,
Iraq. We believe that's the most effective way to move forward.''
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart criticized Bush for turning down a briefing by Pentagon
top brass on the Clinton administration's work to date on the
prospective missile shield.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed anti-missile system has been criticized as a
potential offensive measure by Putin and is expected to be a key
point of contention in the two presidents' first direct talks
Saturday and Sunday in the Russian capital. Clinton contends the
missile shield is intended only to protect the United States from
undependable nations, such as North Korea, or their terrorist
friends.
</P>
<P>
   Although White House aides have worked for the past two weeks to
play down expectations of the U.S. president's initial summit with
Putin, Clinton told a news conference more progress might be in the
offing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would be surprised if we resolved all of our differences on
the question of missile defense, although we might make more
headway than most people expect. I'm just not sure yet,'' Clinton
said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's comments came at the end of a joint meeting between
U.S. government leaders and chiefs of the 15-nation European Union,
a one-day session that produced no discernible progress on the
trickiest trans-Atlantic trade disputes, including the EU ban on
U.S. hormone-treated beef.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton planned to confront another international flash point
Thursday before leaving the Portuguese capital for Berlin. He
rearranged his schedule for a morning session with Prime Minister
Ehud Barak of Israel. Clinton spoke by telephone for 20 minutes
Wednesday with Palestinian leader Yassir Arafat about recent
developments, including the withdrawal of Israeli military from
Lebanon, affecting Israeli-Palestinian plans for a final peace
agreement by fall.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's statements about making more progress on arms control
with Putin left senior White House aides scrambling to describe
what breakthroughs to which he might be referring.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't tell you what he's talking about,'' Tony Blinken, the
National Security Council's senior director for European affairs,
said in a burst of candor.
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart said Clinton was talking about nothing more than a
previously anticipated move by both nations to dispose of 34 tons
each of military-grade plutonium.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not hinting at anything other than a few things that
we've got going,'' Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
   Sandy Berger, Clinton's national security adviser, said last
week in Washington that the United States and Russia had made
``significant progress'' to get rid of weapons-grade materials and
expressed hope that the plutonium agreement would be ready for the
leaders to sign off on in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an enormously important agreement if we're able to
finalize it,'' Berger said. It was a major point not only in the
U.S.-Russia bilateral relationship but also on the broader nuclear
nonproliferation front, he added. Smaller, non-nuclear nations have
been increasingly critical of what they see as U.S. foot-dragging
in scaling back its warhead-making arsenal.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton defended his upcoming meeting with Putin even if the
results are limited.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even in the areas where we may not have an agreement, in some
ways that may be the most important reason for the trip of all,''
Clinton said. ``We shouldn't only do these trips and these
dialogues when we know we've got a guaranteed outcome. Sometimes
it's most important to be talking when there's still unresolved
differences.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton spoke during a joint news conference with Portuguese
Prime Minister Antonio Guterres, whose nation currently holds the
rotating presidency of the European Union, and Romano Prodi, the
former Italian prime minister who is chairman of the EU Commission.
They appeared before a gathering of international reporters in a
sunny plaza at the Que Luz palace outside Lisbon.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, whose sightseeing bug has been little served while in
Portugal, later went for a round of golf near Sintra.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who insists he has not made up his mind about going
forward with the missile defense system, went over the criteria he
says will guide his thinking.
</P>
<P>
   The first is whether ``there is a threat that is new and
different.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The answer to that, it seems to me, is plainly, yes, there is
and there will be one,'' Clinton said, referring to development of
nuclear capabilities by nations not part of international arms
control and nonproliferation pacts.
</P>
<P>
   The other criteria are whether the technology works, whether it
is cost effective and what will be the effect of the system on
``our overall security interests, included but not limited to arms
control.''
</P>
<P>
   Washington's European allies have objected to the missile
defense proposal, in part because they fear it would leave them
undefended.
</P>
<P>
   Guterres said that although there is no official EU position
opposing the missile defense, ``we have ... a main concern'' that
trans-Atlantic security proposals remain ``as comprehensive as
possible.''

EDITORIAL: PHONE RATES HEAD DOWNWARD 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Thursday, June 1:
</P>
<P>
   Telephone customers will soon begin to save money on their
long-distance calls, courtesy of decisions made on Wednesday by the
Federal Communications Commission. Families that make few
long-distance calls will save the most under the commission's
intricate ruling, as much as 50 percent _ a nice touch that brings
the benefits of deregulation to low-income families. But buried
among the regulatory rulings is something that should prove even
more important to most customers in the long run. The commission
wrung subsidies out of regulated rates that have kept prices too
high and have stymied the outbreak of competition that Congress
promised when it passed the 1996 Telecommunications Act.
</P>
<P>
   The issue the commission partially resolved on Wednesday
concerns access charges _ regulated fees that local phone companies
like Bell Atlantic are permitted to charge long-distance carriers
like AT&AMP;T for their use of the wire loops that Bell Atlantic runs
into nearly everyone's home and business. The regional Bells and
long-distance carriers have been fighting over access since the
1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the access charges cover the costs that rise as the
length of individual calls rises. The most important decision the
commission made on Wednesday was to cut these per-minute fees by
about $2 billion a year _ roughly 4 percent of annual long-distance
charges. This would bring these charges down from about five cents
three years ago to about one penny per call, a level close to the
actual costs that local companies incur when their loops are used.
</P>
<P>
   That, in turn, should allow the price of long-distance service
to fall sharply, assuming the carriers pass the savings on to
consumers as they have said they will. By matching prices to costs,
the commission is doing all it can to create markets where the
low-cost provider captures the most business.
</P>
<P>
   Another access charge covers the fixed cost of providing the
loops _ costs that remain the same no matter how many calls are
processed. Here the commission did little more than simplify
billing. These charges currently appear on both local bills and the
long-distance bills. But in the future the two will be combined
into one charge on the local bill. Families will pay less to their
long-distance carrier, but more to the local company. The total
will not change very much, causing consumer groups to criticize the
commission for not making significant cuts. But the commission
pledged to do a careful economic study in two years that will
determine exactly how much customers need to pay to cover the true
costs of maintaining the loops.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest winners on Wednesday will be families that in a
given month make no or very few long-distance calls. Typically,
carriers charge $3 a month for long-distance calls no matter how
few are actually made. As part of the deal, some long-distance
carriers promised to waive these minimum fees.
</P>
<P>
   The 1996 Telecommunications Act invited long-distance carriers
into local service and local carriers into long-distance service.
But so far, customers have reaped only modest benefits. Part of the
problem has been a complicated regulatory system. On Wednesday the
commission simplified billing, brought charges in line with costs
and provided a special boost to low-income families. Nothing
dramatic will result from these steps for now. But over time they
should foster competition, and the savings should mount.

HUNDLEY PLACED ON 15-DAY DISABLED LIST
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Todd Hundley spent the offseason working
vigorously to prove he could return to all-star from, and he was
heading in that direction until, while running the bases, he spun
quickly to see where a ball landed.
</P>
<P>
   Hundley strained the oblique muscle in the right side of his rib
cage in Tuesday night's game. He went on the 15-day disabled list
prior to Wednesday's game against the Mets, but he admitted the
healing process is probably longer. His place on the roster was
taken by infielder Alex Cora, who was recalled from Triple-A
Albuquerque.
</P>
<P>
   ``These things, usually on the average, are three to six weeks
until you feel 100 percent,'' Hundley said. ``The only thing about
it is it's not the cartilage between the ribs. It's really a
delicate thing, and for the next two weeks the trick is not to
aggravate it so you have to start over.''
</P>
<P>
   Veteran Chad Kreuter steps into the starting spot. Kreuter has
built his career around being a strong defensive catcher, but the
loss of Hundley could have a profound effect on the lineup.
</P>
<P>
   Kreuter and Hundley switch-hit, but Hundley's bat is more
potent. He's hitting .290 with 13 homers and 33 RBI, mostly from
the sixth spot in the order, and has provided better pitches for
Eric Karros, Gary Sheffield and Shawn Green. The four have combined
for 52 homers and 157 RBI and are the major reasons the Dodgers are
fourth in the National League with 296 runs scored.
</P>
<P>
   Hundley joins starters Devon White and Adrian Beltre on the
disabled list.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you take out him and Beltre, it's a little different look
in the lineup,'' Dodgers manager Davey Johnson said. ``(Hundley's)
been feeling so good. Whether he's catching or whether he's
hitting, and he's hit well right-handed and left-handed, he's a big
part of our success.''
</P>
<P>
   Hundley was injured during Tuesday's brutal 10-5 loss to Mets.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't breathe,'' Hundley said. ``It felt like someone
punched me and stabbed me with a knife at the same time. It knocked
the wind out of me.''
</P>
<P>
   Team physician Dr. Ralph Gambardella examined Hundley on
Wednesday. It's similar to the injury Todd Hollandsworth
experienced last season. Hollandsworth missed 22 days with his
strained oblique.
</P>
<P>
   Hundley vowed to work twice as hard to recover from this injury
as he did during the winter, when he worked out six days a week to
get his body and right arm in shape for spring training. He's
highly regarded in the clubhouse as an intense worker.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody on this team works harder than him,'' Sheffield said.
``He comes in and works on the elbow, when he's finished with that
he works on his back, and when he's finished with that he working
on his catching.'' &QL;

EDITORIAL: PRESIDENTIAL SUCCESSION IN ISRAEL 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Thursday, June 1:
</P>
<P>
   Ezer Weizman is justly admired for his many contributions to
Israeli public life, including crucial support for peace efforts
with Egypt and the Palestinians. But a withering government report
detailing his receipt of more than $300,000 from two businessmen a
decade ago left him little choice but to resign from the largely
ceremonial office of president effective July 10. Appropriately,
the leading choice to succeed him is another man closely identified
with the quest for Mideast peace, former Prime Minister Shimon
Peres.
</P>
<P>
   Weizman's downfall brings a notable career to a sad end. As air
force commander he helped lead Israel to victory in the 1967 war.
Entering politics, he joined Menachem Begin's conservative Likud
government as defense minister and played a major role in the
diplomacy leading to the Camp David agreement and the 1979 peace
treaty with Egypt, Israel's first with any Arab nation. He later
joined the Labor Party and, with its support, became president in
1993. Stretching the limited powers of that office, he became an
independent-minded advocate for peace, challenging the policies of
Labor as well as Likud governments and becoming popular with the
Israeli public.
</P>
<P>
   But it turns out that Weizman was not quite as independent as he
seemed. The illegal political contributions he secretly accepted
were, by his own acknowledgment, efforts to buy influence with a
rising political star. Had the statute of limitations not run out,
Weizman could have faced criminal charges of bribery.
</P>
<P>
   Peres would make a worthy successor, given his broad experience
and his close personal identification with the peace process.
Awarded a share of the Nobel Peace Prize for his role in
negotiating the 1993 Oslo peace agreements, he became prime
minister after the assassination of his fellow laureate Yitzhak
Rabin in 1995. Since then Peres has sometimes been seen as an
intra-party rival to Prime Minister Ehud Barak. But Barak was smart
to pick him as the candidate of his majority coalition when
Parliament chooses a new president on July 31.
</P>
<P>
   The move will help reinforce the coalition's unity for the
challenging months ahead. Israel must find ways to stabilize its
border with Lebanon in the wake of its rushed withdrawal last week
and the movement of Iranian-backed Hezbollah guerrillas to the
international frontier. It also faces possible new tensions with
Syria over Lebanon and the Golan Heights while trying to meet a
September target date for negotiating a final peace agreement with
the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   Barak will discuss all three of these peace issues with
President Clinton when the two meet in Portugal today. The
questions still to be resolved with the Palestinians and Syria are
difficult but have by now been clearly defined. With enough will on
all sides, they can be bridged. It would be fitting for Peres, as a
newly installed president, to participate in completing the peace
agreements he envisioned and helped design. &QL;

MICROSOFT FILES TECHNICAL CRITIQUE OF GOVERNMENT BREAKUP PLAN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs 18th graf starting: Along with the, etc., to make it read:
Capelles of Compaq xxx)  By JOEL BRINKLEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Ignoring the judge's assertion that he wanted no
more briefs, Microsoft filed a detailed criticism of the
government's breakup plan Wednesday, the last filing for the record
before the judge rules on how to deal with the company's antitrust
violations.
</P>
<P>
   The company's proposal significantly modifies nearly every
element of the government's remedy plan, lengthening the amount of
time the company would have to comply with the order and scaling
back many proposals.
</P>
<P>
   The government proposal ``is defective in numerous respects,
making the document vague and ambiguous'' and therefore ``void and
unenforceable,'' the company's brief said.
</P>
<P>
   An earlier brief, filed on May 10, laid out Microsoft's broad
objections to the remedy proposal. This one is a technical
critique, attacking individual points in the plan, including e-mail
retention rules, joint-venture restrictions and a requirement that
Microsoft's senior managers be required, within 90 days, to certify
that they have read and understood the remedy ruling.
</P>
<P>
   Reacting to the Microsoft filing Wednesday evening, the Justice
Department said: ``This is another effort to posture for appeal.
The filing does not come to grips with the fact that Microsoft has
been found to have repeatedly engaged in serious legal violations,
and serious remedies are required.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft says it intends to appeal as soon as Judge Thomas
Penfield Jackson rules on the remedy, a ruling that is expected
Thursday or Friday. The judge has already suggested that he is
inclined to accept the government's recommendation that the company
be broken up.
</P>
<P>
   Included in the Microsoft filing was a justification for the
company's decision to place a long document called an ``offer of
proof'' in the record during a court hearing on May 24, just before
the judge ended the proceedings. The document included statements
from witnesses that the company would have called or quoted, had
the judge held on a hearing on remedies, as Microsoft requested.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department, also ignoring the judge's no-more-briefs
edict, argued in a brief filed last Friday that the offer-of-proof
filing was cynical and irresponsible. On Wednesday Microsoft called
the government's accusations baseless and submitted an additional
offer of proof.
</P>
<P>
   The latest offer includes statements from seven academic experts
and corporate leaders who say they oppose the government's breakup
plan and related remedy proposals. Among them are Michael Capellas,
the chief executive of Compaq Computer; Jeffrey Katzenberg, founder
of the DreamWorks motion picture studio; Tom Nicely, chairman of
Geico, the insurance company; and John Whitacre, chief executive of
Nordstrom Inc., the department store chain based in Seattle,
Microsoft's hometown.
</P>
<P>
   Among Capellas' complaints is the general concern that Microsoft
would not be allowed to accord Compaq special treatment in pricing
and partnerships.
</P>
<P>
   ``Compaq is several times the size of the 20th largest''
manufacturer, he wrote, and ``there is no reason why Compaq should
not receive more resources from Microsoft, given our greater
investment in testing, distributing and promoting Microsoft's
technology.''
</P>
<P>
   Katzenberg wrote: ``If Microsoft were broken up _ as the
government proposes _ Microsoft's operating systems, applications
and other products over time would become less and less compatible,
both with each other and with the various hardware products used by
DreamWorks.''
</P>
<P>
   Before it critiqued the government's remedy proposal, Microsoft
stressed once again that ``the relief requested by the government
is extreme and unjustified.'' But while the company objected to the
proposal in its entirety, it also picked apart nearly all of its
parts, beginning with the first paragraph.
</P>
<P>
   There, the government gave Microsoft four months after the
judge's ruling to submit a plan for breaking the company into two
parts (though the actual breakup would be stayed until legal
appeals are complete). Microsoft countered by lengthening the time
to 12 months.
</P>
<P>
   The company notes that numerous federal agencies and foreign
governments, in places where Microsoft has subsidiaries, would have
to approve the breakup plan, and ``obtaining such approvals would
be a time consuming process.''
</P>
<P>
   The government plan would create two new companies; one would
hold the Windows operating systems, the other everything else,
including the Office suite of programs like Word for word
processing and Excel for spreadsheet calculations.
</P>
<P>
   Under the plan, the applications company would have rights to
Internet Explorer, the company's Web browser, and could license it
back to the operating system company. But in Wednesday's brief,
Microsoft makes the same argument it has put forward since 1997,
that there is no such thing as a Web browser; Internet Explorer is
merely a feature in Windows. Jackson forcefully rejected that
argument in his rulings.
</P>
<P>
   Along with the breakup plan, the government has proposed a long
list of rules that would modify Microsoft's conduct. The company
picked those apart, too. For one, it deleted a provision
prohibiting Microsoft from making special marketing deals with
computer makers _ the provision Capellas of Compaq also opposed.
During the trial, the government showed that Microsoft sometimes
used the special deals to reward companies that followed
Microsoft's lead on issues of importance to the company.
</P>
<P>
   Among other changes, the company proposed to charge other
companies ``a reasonable royalty'' for access to technical data
about Windows needed to design programs that run with the operating
system.
</P>
<P>
   The company also deleted a requirement that it retain all of the
e-mail written by senior company managers for four years, calling
the proposal ``overly broad and unduly burdensome.'' It was e-mail
from company managers, including Bill Gates, the chairman, that
formed the basis for the government's successful suit against
Microsoft.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The federal government and many of the nation's
leading telephone companies agreed Wednesday to a reshuffling of
phone rates that would reduce the bills of tens of millions of
less-affluent consumers.
</P>
<P>
   The reductions, described by fficials of the Federal
Communications Commission as the largest rate cut in the history of
federal telephone regulation, should lead to less-significant cuts
for other consumers and businesses. And the changes could
ultimately lead to a flat rate for long-distance service, much like
fees paid by mobile phone users.
</P>
<P>
   Government officials said they had a commitment from the
long-distance companies to pass on to consumers the benefits of
$3.2 billion in savings from a reduction in the payments they make
to local telephone companies to connect calls to customers, known
as access charges.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said the cuts would have the biggest effect on the
poor and those who use their phones the least. Rates would be
reduced as much as 50 percent _ to $4.68 from $9.39 a month in a
typical case _ for Americans who make few or no long-distance
calls.
</P>
<P>
   For consumers and businesses that make more long-distance calls,
the government predicted reduced costs, though some consumer groups
and Wall Street analysts disagreed with the government's estimates,
suggesting they were too rosy.
</P>
<P>
   The consumer groups and analysts questioned whether the
significant savings recognized by the long-distance companies would
ultimately be passed on to consumers. They also said that the
government could not force the companies to pass the savings on to
the consumers, who would have to rely on the good faith of the
long-distance companies.
</P>
<P>
   But officials said that when access charges were last reduced
three years ago, the long-distance companies began engaging in a
price war that drastically lowered overall phone rates.
</P>
<P>
   The critics and analysts said, however, that long-distance
companies had been slow to pass on all of the savings when the
access charges were cut and that the benefit to consumers from the
price wars was offset by new fees tacked on to their bills.
</P>
<P>
   Critics and officials agreed that Wednesday's action would
fundamentally reshape the economics of the telephone industry and
that it was another big step toward deregulation. It is also part
of an evolution toward a price structure in which long-distance
rates will ultimately be like wireless and Internet service rates _
either a flat monthly fee or a fee that entitles the customer to a
bundle of minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today's announcement is a giant step forward in rationalizing
pricing,'' said William Kennard, the chairman of the FCC. ``This is
the most dramatic reduction in telephone service prices in the
history of this agency.''
</P>
<P>
   Kennard said the price changes would take effect in July. He
said the commission's action was an effort to accelerate
competition by ending several implicit subsidies.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's moves involved an agreement and an order by the FCC.
They were the products of more than a year of intense negotiations
among local and long-distance companies and federal regulators on
issues that have divided the local and long-distance providers from
the moment they were created with the breakup of AT&AMP;T 16 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Telephone executives from most of the nation's top companies
applauded the order.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the results of today's action start showing up on
customer bills in a month or so, consumers will see that the total
cost of local and long-distance telephone service will be down,''
said Duane Ackerman, the chairman and chief executive of BellSouth.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the same time,'' he said, ``those customers who live in
rural areas that are expensive to serve and those people who need
help paying their phone bills will be ensured affordable service
well into the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials said that the companies had ultimately reached an
agreement with one another and regulators because of several
important trends, including the blurring of the lines between local
and long-distance companies, the competitive threats posed by the
emergence of telephone service on the Internet and the heavy
pressure put on regulators by a Republican Congress to reduce
regulations and let the marketplace play a greater role in setting
prices.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the agreement, AT&AMP;T said it would eliminate the $3
minimum monthly fee that it charges to millions of customers who
make few or no long-distance calls.
</P>
<P>
   Combined with other changes announced Wednesday, a typical
monthly bill for an AT&AMP;T customer who makes no long-distance calls
would be cut in half. For a customer who made 10 minutes of
long-distance calls, total monthly charges would decrease 27
percent, to $6.87 from $9.39.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The order simplifies telephone bills by folding two separate
charges _ one for the cost of telephone lines and the other a
special access charge _ into one. It reduces an earlier announced
rate increase for the combined items by 66 cents a month.
</P>
<P>
   The centerpiece of the agreement, spelled out in the summary of
the order that will soon be issued by the commission, reduces by
$3.2 billion the access charges that long-distance companies like
AT&AMP;T and Sprint pay to local telephone companies like Bell Atlantic
to use their lines at the beginning and end of a call. The
reduction amounts to a cut of about 25 percent in access fees paid
to the local companies.
</P>
<P>
   Commission officials said they could not precisely quantify the
reduction for heavy users of long-distance services, and some
analysts and consumer groups said they doubted that many of the
savings would result in significantly lower bills.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope that the FCC will monitor this process to ensure that
the $3.2 billion in long-distance company savings are translated
into demonstrable price reductions for consumers,'' said Gene
Kimmelman, co-director of the Washington office of Consumers Union.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today's decision is a clear benefit for people who make few or
no long-distance calls,'' he said. ``But it still leaves consumers
paying inflated monthly charges.''
</P>
<P>
   Scott C. Cleland, a telecommunications analyst at the Legg Mason
Precursor Group, said that experience had shown that the companies
had not passed on savings from reductions in access charges.
</P>
<P>
   ``The companies have a fiduciary responsibility to their
shareholders to not necessarily pass them on,'' Cleland said. ``To
the extent that prices don't fall, these savings increase
long-distance profits. The companies may pass them on, but it will
be over time.''
</P>
<P>
   Industry executives said the decision was part of a trend that
will lead to long-distance fees' resembling the fees charged by
Internet companies and cell phone providers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pricing structure that these rules permit allows us to
move more in the direction that will ultimately lead to Internet
pricing or wireless pricing in the long-distance market,'' said
John Nakahata, a former top official at the FCC and spokesman for
the coalition of telephone companies that signed the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of the fee changes, local telephone companies stand
to get a short-term shortfall of as much as $500 million over the
next year. But industry executives and analysts said that lower
prices should increase demand more than enough to offset the
shortfall.
</P>
<P>
   ``This industry is growing at a rapid rate, and we're all
realizing significant cost reductions,'' said Frank Gumper, vice
president for regulatory and long-range planning at Bell Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   Traders on Wall Street shrugged off the announcement of the rate
changes. There was no uniform movement in the stock prices of
telephone companies, and changes were modest.
</P>
<P>
   In a partial dissent to Wednesday's order, a commissioner
accused the FCC staff of making improper side deals with the
telephone industry to gain its support for the order.
</P>
<P>
   The commissioner, Harold Furchtgott-Roth, said that in exchange
for the industry's support, the staff had agreed to waive certain
onerous depreciation rules and rule favorably in a separate access
fee proceeding. Both proceedings involve billions of dollars for
the companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be clear, I do not believe that any employee of this agency
acted in bad faith'' Furchtgott-Roth wrote. ``But I cannot escape
the conclusion that the process by which this notice has been
promulgated falls short of certain fundamental principles that
govern the behavior of administrative agencies.''
</P>
<P>
   Both industry lobbyists and staff officials denied that any
separate deals had been reached.

WHY WASTE GREAT ONE ON HOCKEY? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News  Service clients)  
 BY E.J. MONTINI  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (Phoenix) - Republican presidential candidate George W. Bush and
U.S. drug czar Barry McCaffrey were in town Wednesday for what I
can only presume to be the obvious reason: meeting Wayne Gretzky.
</P>
<P>
   For weeks now, Gretzky has been on the front page of the local
papers and on the TV news programs, always pre sented lovingly, as
if all of the report ers, politicians and businessmen in town were
auditioning to play Romeo to Wayne's Julietzky.
</P>
<P>
   Then, finally. it happened.
</P>
<P>
   The Great One (as he's known to hockey fans and TV anchors)
saved Phoenix and perhaps the world by agreeing to join in the
ownership of the Phoenix Coyotes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unbelievable. This is the best thing in the entire
world,'' Coyotes captain Keith Tkachuk said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wayne is just absolutely a fine, fine man,'' said Phoenix
developer Steve Ellman, who heads the group pur chasing the Coyotes
and redevelop ing Los Arcos Mall into a hockey arena. ``I hope
people understand the magnitude of what this means for all
involved.''
</P>
<P>
   Like so many others in town, I didn't completely understand the
magni tude of the event, for which I am full of regretzky.
</P>
<P>
   I understand now.
</P>
<P>
   Within minutes after Ellman an nounced that Gretzky would join
the Coyotes ownership team, Ellman be gan receiving $1 million
offers from potential investors.
</P>
<P>
   The organization has also seen a big boost in season-ticket
sales.
</P>
<P>
   Before you know it, the struggling Coyotes will be out of
debtzky.
</P>
<P>
   All because of Wayne.
</P>
<P>
   For this reason, I figure Bush jetted into Arizona to interview
Gretzky as a possible vice presidential candidate (figuring
Republicans in Congress _ except John McCain, of course _ will
overlook the rule prohibiting Canadi ans from holding office in the
United States, at least until the Great One draws more of those
million-dollar ``investors.'')
</P>
<P>
   As for McCaffrey, maybe he's trying to find out if Wayne would
be willing lend the magic of his name in support of our unending
war on narcotics.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a terrible threatzky,'' McCaffrey might say.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately for them, Gretzky's not here yet. He changed his
plans and won't be in town until Friday.
</P>
<P>
   By then, hopefully, Arizona Gov. Jane Hull will have convinced
Gretzky that his talents can serve higher purposes than
professional hockey or presiden tial politics.
</P>
<P>
   Education, for example, for which Ar izona consistently ranks at
the bottom of the funding list, causing local par ents to fretzky.
</P>
<P>
   Or perhaps Gretzky can solve the growing problem of illegal
immigra tion.
</P>
<P>
   Or advise the Legislature on how to spend the billions of
dollars in lawsuit settlement it's receiving from compa nies that
produce cigarettezkys.
</P>
<P>
   The health care crisis Arizona's chil dren face could certainly
use a Great One.
</P>

<P>
   NEW YORK _ For eight hours after his arrest last week, John
Taylor sat with investigators in a second-floor squad room at the
111th Precinct in northern Queens, unwinding the spool of his life,
from his childhood in a Brooklyn housing project to his role in the
execution-style slayings of five people in the basement of a
Wendy's in Flushing.
</P>
<P>
   In a voice devoid of emotion, Taylor detailed the killings,
explained how he had acquired the gun, a .380-caliber bought on the
streets, and traced his escape route home, cab by cab,
investigators said.
</P>
<P>
   But they said he never came close to answering the question that
hung in the interrogation room all night: how a 36-year-old man who
once displayed a devoted work ethic, a love for his children and an
engaging smile had evolved into someone capable of the carnage that
ended an armed robbery.
</P>
<P>
   ``I spoke to a psychiatrist this afternoon, and even with all
the information we have, who can say?'' an investigator said.
``Maybe he thought there was an easier way than working.''
</P>
<P>
   Even as police and prosecutors amass what they characterize as
an overwhelming volume of evidence against Taylor and his
accomplice, Craig Godineaux, law enforcement officials acknowledge
that they have gained little insight into what motivated the
viciousness of the murders, aside from the pair's concession that
they had sought to eliminate all witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   John Taylor's previous crimes, one burglary and a few robberies
that the authorities say he admitted to, were brazen, but never
violent. The law-breaking began only a few years ago, after Taylor
had built a reputation as a dutiful manager who spent 14 years
working in the same McDonald's franchise in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators acknowledged that perhaps no amount of
psychological theorizing could ever make sense of what happened in
the Wendy's last week. But they said the involvement of Taylor, who
is thought to have planned the crime, is particularly baffling. By
all appearances, his crimes had been aberrations in an adult life
unaffected by mental illness, drug addiction or grudges.
</P>
<P>
   He filed his income taxes. He paid Social Security taxes for his
baby sitter. He took an accident prevention course last year
sponsored by the New York Department of Motor Vehicles. He was
known around his former home in Lefrak City as the sort of person
who took his four children, two boys and two girls, 5 to 13 years
old, to the video store to rent movies like ``The Big Green,'' a
family soccer story; and Jackie Chan's latest high-action thriller.
</P>
<P>
   ``John seemed like the kind of guy you would trust with your
kids,'' said Edward Wills, who supervised him for eight of the 14
years that Taylor worked as an assistant manager at a McDonald's in
Midtown. ``I don't think this is the same John.''
</P>
<P>
   Those who worked with Taylor in five restaurants said he had
grown sullen and withdrawn, with few friends. They said he became a
strict manager, intolerant of small mistakes, even as he was
accused several times of filching cash.
</P>
<P>
   But, as the Queens district attorney, Richard A. Brown, tries to
decide whether these killings warrant the death penalty, several
investigators said they were most struck by Taylor's chilling
ability to distance himself from the crime. On the day after the
killings, for example, he went to work at a clothing store, where
he was a salesman. That afternoon, he called a 26-year-old woman he
had begun courting.
</P>
<P>
   Although authorities have said that Taylor has confessed to
shooting one of the seven people shot that night, he has yet to
enter a formal plea. A trial to determine his guilt is months away.
</P>
<P>
   John Benjamin Taylor, who often uses the nickname Benji, was
born March 10, 1964, the first of four children of John and Audrey
Taylor. He, his younger brother, Vaughn, and two sisters were
raised in an apartment in Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   His parents, who divorced in 1993 after being separated for at
least 10 years, declined to be interviewed for this article, as did
Taylor's lawyer, John Youngblood.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor's mother, who now uses her birth name, Audrey Saddler,
had recognized the Wendy's on the news as the place where her son
had worked, said Roy Earl, her boyfriend. Within hours, she was
confronted by detectives seeking to question Taylor.
</P>
<P>
   After his arrest, Taylor spent hours talking to Detectives Louis
Pia, Brian Quinn and Elizabeth Curcio. By his own account, Taylor
has always been closer to his father. He moved from his mother's
apartment in Brooklyn to his father's apartment in Queens in 1982
after graduating from East New York Vocational High School.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor told detectives that the move was prompted by an argument
with his mother, who feared he was involved in gang activity and
might lure his younger brother into trouble. But residents recalled
that, during an era when gang violence in the projects was growing,
John Taylor was routinely seen walking off to work in the uniform
of a fast-food worker.
</P>
<P>
   For years, John Taylor seemed to be the more stable of the two
brothers. While John was working as an assistant manager at a
McDonald's in Manhattan, his brother, Vaughn, was being arrested
for minor crimes in Suffolk County, where he lived.
</P>
<P>
   John Taylor's relationship with both of his parents has
deteriorated.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, when he left jail after his arrest on a robbery
charge, Taylor filed a complaint with the police, accusing his
father of stealing the furniture from his Lefrak City apartment.
</P>
<P>
   In the fast-food industry, in which workers often change jobs
frequently, Taylor was a study in permanence, commuting daily for
years from Queens to his job as an assistant manager at a
McDonald's in midtown Manhattan. He was punctual and polite, and
several friends recalled that he talked often of owning his own
store.
</P>
<P>
   But something seemed to change in 1996. There were whispers
among co-workers that Taylor had placed ghost employees on the
payroll. He was transferred to another location, although Wills
said the only problem had been that Taylor's performance had
slumped a bit and he wanted to give him a new challenge.
</P>
<P>
   Several months later, Taylor was discovered at the back at the
midtown store at 6 a.m., trying to break into the safe. Taylor, who
said he needed the money for his children, was sentenced to five
years' probation. It was his first offense.
</P>
<P>
   By 1998, he was working as an assistant manager at the Wendy's
in Flushing. Some former employees said he was pleasant, but
authorities said he was caught stealing in May 1999 and transferred
to another Wendy's for several weeks.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the police say they believe that Taylor, armed
with a starter's pistol, embarked on a spree in which he robbed or
tried to rob five restaurants in Queens, beginning with a Burger
King. In that incident, on June 15, a supervisor went for the phone
to call police and the robber ran off.
</P>
<P>
   Eight days later, Taylor was arrested, the police said, after he
robbed a McDonald's for the second time in four days. He was held
until August, when he posted $3,500 bail and returned home to
Lefrak City to find that his apartment had been emptied of
furniture, the authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   Neighbors said he still had a job, however, as a manager at a
Wendy's in Elmhurst. One neighbor, George Gross, said Taylor helped
his daughter get a job at the same store, but she soon found him
unsettling.
</P>
<P>
   ``She never complained about anybody the way she complained
about him,'' he said. ``She just said: `He's not right. He is too
serious.'''
</P>
<P>
   Last October, within a few weeks, Taylor was evicted from his
apartment and was fired from his job, the authorities said. At the
same time, out on bail in his robbery case, in which prosecutors
were pushing for a 12-year prison sentence, he failed to show up
for court.
</P>
<P>
   He then hid in plain sight, taking a room at $85 a week in a
private house in Jamaica, only three miles from Queens Supreme
Court, where a warrant had been issued for his re-arrest.
</P>
<P>
   He found work a few blocks away, first at a leather goods store
and later as a salesman at SC&AMP;R Clothing, Taylor told detectives.
He and Godineaux were both working at the store last week when, the
police say, they robbed Wendy's of $2,400 and left seven people for
dead in the basement.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, Thursday, Taylor showed up for work, leaving at
7:30 p.m. to watch the Knicks game.
</P>
<P>
   The following morning, according to Taylor's statement to
police, he heard his name on television as a suspect in the
killings, and he decided to flee.
</P>
<P>
   But first, in an unusual move, he called in sick at the clothing
store, said the owner, Anna Biton. She said he told her his father
had died and he had to bury him in South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   He then went to the home of his brother's wife in Brentwood,
N.Y., where he was arrested.
</P>
<P>
   On the way back to Queens, Taylor began telling the first of
several accounts of the killings, a law enforcement official
recalled. It was a story full of facts, but one that shed little
light on how Taylor had come to participate in such violence, the
official said.
</P>
<P>
   Another investigator said he could not imagine any account that
would adequately explain the killings.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I could think and understand how someone could do something
like that,'' he said, ``then it's time to quit.''

WHY WASTE GREAT ONE ON HOCKEY? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News  Service clients)  
 BY E.J. MONTINI  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (Phoenix) - Republican presidential candidate George W. Bush and
U.S. drug czar Barry McCaffrey were in town Wednesday for what I
can only presume to be the obvious reason: meeting Wayne Gretzky.
</P>
<P>
   For weeks now, Gretzky has been on the front page of the local
papers and on the TV news programs, always pre sented lovingly, as
if all of the report ers, politicians and businessmen in town were
auditioning to play Romeo to Wayne's Julietzky.
</P>
<P>
   Then, finally. it happened.
</P>
<P>
   The Great One (as he's known to hockey fans and TV anchors)
saved Phoenix and perhaps the world by agreeing to join in the
ownership of the Phoenix Coyotes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unbelievable. This is the best thing in the entire
world,'' Coyotes captain Keith Tkachuk said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wayne is just absolutely a fine, fine man,'' said Phoenix
developer Steve Ellman, who heads the group pur chasing the Coyotes
and redevelop ing Los Arcos Mall into a hockey arena. ``I hope
people understand the magnitude of what this means for all
involved.''
</P>
<P>
   Like so many others in town, I didn't completely understand the
magni tude of the event, for which I am full of regretzky.
</P>
<P>
   I understand now.
</P>
<P>
   Within minutes after Ellman an nounced that Gretzky would join
the Coyotes ownership team, Ellman be gan receiving $1 million
offers from potential investors.
</P>
<P>
   The organization has also seen a big boost in season-ticket
sales.
</P>
<P>
   Before you know it, the struggling Coyotes will be out of
debtzky.
</P>
<P>
   All because of Wayne.
</P>
<P>
   For this reason, I figure Bush jetted into Arizona to interview
Gretzky as a possible vice presidential candidate (figuring
Republicans in Congress _ except John McCain, of course _ will
overlook the rule prohibiting Canadi ans from holding office in the
United States, at least until the Great One draws more of those
million-dollar ``investors.'')
</P>
<P>
   As for McCaffrey, maybe he's trying to find out if Wayne would
be willing lend the magic of his name in support of our unending
war on narcotics.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a terrible threatzky,'' McCaffrey might say.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately for them, Gretzky's not here yet. He changed his
plans and won't be in town until Friday.
</P>
<P>
   By then, hopefully, Arizona Gov. Jane Hull will have convinced
Gretzky that his talents can serve higher purposes than
professional hockey or presiden tial politics.
</P>
<P>
   Education, for example, for which Ar izona consistently ranks at
the bottom of the funding list, causing local par ents to fretzky.
</P>
<P>
   Or perhaps Gretzky can solve the growing problem of illegal
immigra tion.
</P>
<P>
   Or advise the Legislature on how to spend the billions of
dollars in lawsuit settlement it's receiving from compa nies that
produce cigarettezkys.
</P>
<P>
   The health care crisis Arizona's chil dren face could certainly
use a Great One.
</P>
<P>
   And what about the drought? And the ensuing fires? Would Wayne
have ways to make us all wetzky?
</P>
<P>
   We'll make it worth his while. We'll feed him crepes suzettezky.
Sculpt a statuettezky. Do a pirouttezky. Even give him a
Corvettezky.
</P>
<P>
   He's worth it. You'll see on Friday, when he is mobbed by the
press and the temperature is 105, and for the Great One it's no
sweatzky.

CONE FALTERS AS YANKS LOSE TO ATHLETICS 
</HEADLINE>
   By JACK CURRY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ David Cone's right hand was locked on his hip, his
eyes were focused on the grass and his mind was probably on what he
could do to emerge from this predicament. It was only the first
inning and the New York Yankees merely trailed the Oakland
Athletics by three runs, but Cone already looked deflated.
</P>
<P>
   The body language of slumped shoulders, frustrated expressions
and deep exhales told as much of a story about Cone as the numbers
dotting the scoreboard. It was an awful evening for Cone, who knew
that he did not have an effective repertory of pitches and quickly
discovered that he could not trick the Oakland batters either.
</P>
<P>
   Long after he was gone, the Yankees had stumbled to an 8-7 loss
at Yankee Stadium that left Cone with a 1-5 record after the
season's first two months.
</P>
<P>
   Cone was gone by the fourth inning, battered and bruised because
he could not summon a decent fastball, a decent slider or a decent
anything. The 37-year-old pitcher allowed six earned runs on six
hits and four walks in 3 1/3 innings, and he jogged to the dugout
amid cheers and boos. He had a look of resignation across his
reddened face. The Yankees were mystified.
</P>
<P>
   ``He leaves nothing in the bag,'' said manager Joe Torre, before
the game. ``He bares his soul. I don't want to say anyone wants to
win more for him. But they know what he's going through. They feel
that responsibility.''
</P>
<P>
   Cone said: ``I just didn't have it. I have no excuses. It was
just a poor effort.''
</P>
<P>
   Jorge Posada, the Yankee catcher, said: ``He couldn't throw a
strike. He was angry with himself. You could see a little
frustration. He tried everything. Today, it didn't work out.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The panic button is never too far in George Steinbrenner's
world, even if the two-time defending World Series champions have a
winning record. But the Yankees have now lost four of their last
six games and they are about to begin a treacherous stretch in
which they will play seven straight series against teams with
winning records, starting with the Braves Friday night in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   That is why the Yankees are aggressively pursuing someone to
help improve their underachieving offense. They have had
discussions with the Houston Astros about Moises Alou and they are
still talking to the Cincinnati Reds about a trade that would
involve Dmitri Young and Ramiro Mendoza.
</P>
<P>
   The more the Yankees falter, the more anxious Steinbrenner will
get to make a change, although Rickey Ledee, the owner's scapegoat,
helped the Yankees climb back into Wednesday night's game twice
with a three-run homer and a run-scoring double.
</P>
<P>
   Cone needs to make some changes soon. With two out in the first,
he gave up a single and a walk and then Matt Stairs lined a
three-run homer into the first row of seats in right field. Eric
Chavez walked and scored in the second, but Chuck Knoblauch's
three-run homer off Gil Heredia made it 4-3 after two.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Cone labored. He walked two more in the third and was
fortunate to emerge unscathed, but he could not pull off another
Houdini act in the fourth. Chavez bashed a homer to put the A's
ahead, 5-3, and, after two more hard singles, Torre burst out of
the dugout to end the fiasco.
</P>
<P>
   Both runners scored off Allan Watson, the first on a sacrifice
fly and the second on Posada's throwing error, to increase
Oakland's lead to 7-3.
</P>
<P>
   After Ledee's homer cut the deficit to 7-6, the Yankees botched
a chance to tie the score when Scott Brosius was caught stealing. &QL;

NASCAR DRIVERS STRUGGLE WITH TIME CRUNCH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHN STURBIN 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Total access, or a reasonable facsimile thereof, has helped
transform most NASCAR Winston Cup drivers into household names, and
the series into a runaway success.
</P>
<P>
   But Cup drivers are finding it increasingly difficult to balance
what they need to get accomplished on the racetrack with the
never-ending demands being placed upon them by fans, sponsors and
the media.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be a Winston Cup driver, you sell your privacy forever.
It's gone. That's it,'' said Mark Martin, 41, a perennial
championship contender and therefore, a garage-area celebrity. ``I
sold it \Rhis privacy\S down the river, you know, to do this. I
didn't know it when I did it, but I knew after I did it. And it
will not ever, ever be the same again.''
</P>
<P>
   Even the once-simple courtesy of signing an autograph can become
a chore, Martin said, who recalled the days before his NASCAR
career when he raced before perhaps 3,000 people in the stands.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, we have 3,000 people in the garage,'' said Martin, driver
of the No. 6 Valvoline Ford Taurus and ace of Jack Roush's five-car
stable. ``Times have changed, racing has changed and we can't
service everybody that wants what they want. And so, that's
frustrating for the fans and that's frustrating for the drivers,
because no matter what we do, we can't do enough. And it's not that
we don't want to, it's that you can't.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you've got 30 seconds and you've got 100 people standing
there, what do you do? Do you do one? Do you do 10? Or do you just
do none? I mean, you don't have a good choice left in situations
like that. I don't know what to do. Sometimes, I just do the kids.
Sometimes I can't even do that. Sometimes I do the kids and the
parents swear at me. You can't win. It's physically impossible for
us to do the exact right thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin said there are nights he goes to bed sick to his stomach
_ or just plain mad _ because he was unable to fulfill everyone's
request for his signature.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes I go to bed brokenhearted,'' Martin said, ``because
I think it wouldn't have taken that much more out of my time to
have done that, and that would have touched their lives forever.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the best driver never to have won a Cup championship,
Martin noted that his 7-year-old son, Matt, is a budding racer who
could compete in NASCAR some day.
</P>
<P>
   ``My son already signs autographs, you know,'' said Martin,
whose youngster is in his second season of racing in Florida. ``I
tell him all the time, `You've got to be nice to the fans. You've
got to realize that the fans are what makes this sport go round.' I
work on him regularly.''
\Nsubheds:PIT STOPS On the Juan watch
</P>
<P>
   Where's Juan?
</P>
<P>
   When last sighted, reigning Indianapolis 500 champion Juan
Montoya was throwing a baseball over the backstop at Yankee Stadium
on Tuesday night. Another Mariano Rivera, he's not.
</P>
<P>
   And don't look for Montoya and his Target/Chip Ganassi Racing
team to try to reprise their effort at the Indianapolis Motor
Speedway during the Casino Magic 500 night race at Texas Motor
Speedway on June 10.
</P>
<P>
   Entering a second Indy Racing League event this season never was
part of car owner Ganassi's game plan, team spokeswoman Jana
Griffith said yesterday. Budweiser gave Ganassi $3 million in
additional sponsorship budget to run Indy, an amount that
reportedly doubled if either Montoya or teammate Jimmy Vasser won.
</P>
<P>
   Montoya, reigning Championship Auto Racing Teams FedEx Series
champion, is scheduled to make a promotional appearance at
Ganassi's Chicago Motor Speedway on June 10. CART's Target Grand
Prix is scheduled there on July 30.
</P>
<P>
   Eddie Gossage, executive vice president and general manager of
TMS, said he left a congratulatory message on Ganassi's cellphone
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I reminded him the door is open \Rat TMS\S,'' said Gossage,
who since 1997 has built promotion of this race around the new Indy
500 champion. ``To me, it's the cars and stars of the Indy 500
coming. I thought Juan Montoya was absolutely unbelievable on
Sunday. I said going in they're the favorite _ best driver, best
crew, best resources, best owner in the business. No surprise.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real question is, since he's never run on a high-speed,
high-banked oval of this nature ... could he do it here? And I
think not, to be perfectly honest. But it's like any IRL race, the
Indy 500 included. The door is wide open for them to run here.''
\Nsubheds:Road-course plans ready Construction on the permanent
road course in the infield of Texas Motor Speedway is scheduled to
begin June 12, the Monday after the IRL race in Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   Eddie Gossage, TMS executive vice president and general manager,
said IRL driver Davey Hamilton, American Le Mans Series regular
David Brabham and three-time Indy 500 champion Johnny Rutherford of
Fort Worth contributed to the design of an infield layout measuring
1.17 miles and featuring six turns. All but approximately 160 feet
of the 1.5-mile quadoval also have been incorporated into the
design, which will make the total approximate length at 2.6 miles.
</P>
<P>
   The course will be used for the first time on Labor Day weekend,
when the ALMS and BFGoodrich Trans-Am Series compete in the
inaugural Grand Prix of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're also very close to landing a top-notch
internationally known driving school for better than 100 days a
year on the road course,'' Gossage said. ``That's pretty strong.''
\Nsubheds:The last word ``He didn't build it because he loved us.
He just got some free concrete.''
