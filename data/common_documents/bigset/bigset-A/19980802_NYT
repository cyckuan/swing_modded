RED SOX BEAT ANGELS
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ On paper, the game looked like a mismatch:
Pedro Martinez of the Boston Red Sox facing the Angels' Allen
Watson.
</P>
<P>
   And the paper was right.
</P>
<P>
   Watson pitched well Saturday until an error by first baseman
Dave Hollins paved the way for a two-run fourth inning for the Red
Sox. Then Watson caved in. And the Angels followed, ultimately
losing 11-3 at Edison Field.
</P>
<P>
   Watson gave up a two-run home run to No. 8 hitter Mike Benjamin
to put Boston ahead 4-0 in the fifth. In the sixth, Damon Buford
hit a two-run homer for a 6-0 Red Sox lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels managed three runs off Martinez, but the Angels
bullpen allowed five runs in the ninth to finish the game with a
thud.
</P>
<P>
   It was Angels' fourth loss in five games on an important
homestand that is matching this team against the American League's
best: New York, Boston, Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew coming into the homestand who we were playing, who was
pitching (for the opposition),'' Angels manager Terry Collins said.
``We knew we couldn't afford to make mistakes against teams like
that. We've got to capitalize on our opportunities, we've got to
pitch better. It's the complete package. We're not playing well.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is we're just not getting it done. You can't
point the finger at any one part of our game.''
</P>
<P>
   The beginning of the end started in the bottom of the third
inning when the Angels put runners on first and third with nobody
out. Darin Erstad hit a chopper to Martinez on the mound, and
Martinez caught Matt Walbeck between third and home and threw him
out.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez escaped without giving up a run, and the Red Sox seized
the opportunity in the top of the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   John Valentin led off with a popup behind the mound. Hollins
called for the ball but dropped it. The Red Sox took advantage by
scoring two runs in the inning and rolled from there.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if (the error) broke his concentration or not,''
Collins said of Watson, ``but you've got to be able to battle
through it and we didn't.''
</P>
<P>
   There was talk of possible trades before Friday night's
deadline. Then nothing happened. But shortstop Gary DiSarcina, who
had two hits off Martinez, said the uncertainty shouldn't have been
distracting to the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I come here to play baseball,'' he said. ``You know, playing
shortstop in the major leagues is pretty difficult. And facing
Pedro Martinez is pretty difficult. I can only speak for myself,
because everybody's different. Some guys speak their mind and put
blame somewhere else. But the bottom line is you're here to play.
You don't get paid to worry about other things.''
</P>
<P>
   The Angels have plenty to worry about without looking elsewhere.
The bullpen has been horrible in the past three games, allowing 12
runs in 62/3 innings. And the offense continues to struggle when it
has opportunities to score.
</P>
<P>
   With two out and runners in scoring position this season, the
Angels are hitting .190 as a team. Saturday, they were 1 for 7 with
runners in scoring position, the only hit being Orlando Palmeiro's
two-run single with the bases loaded. Jim Edmonds drove in the
Angels' other run with his 16th homer of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez (15-3) joined the Yankees' David Cone as the only
15-game winners in the majors.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been playing good teams,'' said Garret Anderson, whose
hitting streak ended at 28 with an 0-for-4 performance. ``You can't
give these teams too many mistakes. It seems like we're playing
just good enough to lose. And (in) some other games, these teams
are just flat-out beating us.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Boston is pretty comparable to New York,'' DiSarcina said.
``They may not have the starting pitching New York has, but they're
solid. We're short right now. We can't give these teams any extra
outs. We've got to move runners over. We can't make errors. We have
to do all the little things. If we don't, we lose to these teams.''

COWBOY'S FRIENDS, FANS WISH HIM `HAPPY TRAILS'
</HEADLINE>

BY MELISSA SCHMITT  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ ``Goodbye, good luck and may the good Lord take a
liking to ya.''
</P>
<P>
   These were some of Roy Rogers' own words that friends,
acquaintances and fans spoke in saying farewell to the cowboy star
at a suburban Los Angeles church during a simple memorial service
Saturday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Rogers died &UR;  &LR; July 6 at the age of 86 at his home in the Southern
California desert community of Apple Valley, near Victorville, a
hero to the fans of his TV show and 100 movies.
</P>
<P>
   And long ago, while his face was a regular on the television
screen and in Hollywood, he touched the lives of a small group of
people who knew him as a congregation member of Pioneer Church,
before it was moved to Oakwood Memorial Park and preserved as a
landmark 33 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   It was $1,000 of the beloved cowboy's money that started the
fund that eventually paid for the moving of the church.
</P>
<P>
   Those who filled the wooden pews at the church Saturday morning,
as a breeze fluttered the white embroidered curtains, remembered
those days with pride.
</P>
<P>
   Fanning themselves with programs, they remembered Rogers as
patient, loving, charitable and wonderful with children.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was true to the values of his on-screen performance,'' said
Lila Schepler, who went to church with Rogers and organized the
service. ``He has graduated to his new role as one of God's
angels.''
</P>
<P>
   The service attracted about 100 people to Pioneer Church, now
standing in the rear of Oakwood Memorial Park.
</P>
<P>
   Rogers was honored at the service with a rendition of ``Happy
Trails,'' the reading of ``The Cowboy's Prayer'' and by guitarist
David Arlen, who played ``Cool Clear Water.''
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the service, those in attendance dropped cash into
a Stetson that will go to benefit the Roy Rogers Museum in
Victorville.
</P>
<P>
   Outside, people gathered to share their stories and memories of
Rogers and his wife, Dale Evans.
</P>
<P>
   Leo Alexander and his daughter Sharon Thornton are in Los
Angeles this week visiting friends they knew in Houston long ago.
The friends now live in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've liked Roy Rogers ever since I was a little girl in
Houston,'' said Thornton, 56, of Giddings, Texas, a small town
about 50 miles outside Austin.
</P>
<P>
   ``Daddy took me to see Roy Rogers, and he shook my hand,'' she
said with a Texas drawl. ``I won a bicycle in a coloring contest,
tickets to the rodeo and lunch with Roy Rogers. But Daddy is the
one who wanted to come today.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Daddy'' is now 84, but he can still remember seeing Rogers in
a Houston parade and running up to him for a handshake.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody was hollerin','' Alexander said outside the church.
``I raced over and shook his hand.''
</P>
<P>
   Frank Dolezal, 52; his wife, Barbara, 50; and their daughter
Clarissa, 15, enjoyed the service as well.
</P>
<P>
   Marlene Winstead, 60, and Mark Davis, 54, of Chatsworth said
they attended the service after seeing a notice at the public
library.
</P>
<P>
   ``Seeing that we live in Chatsworth, we felt this is something
we should participate in,'' Winstead said.
</P>
<P>
   One of Rogers' daughters attended the ceremony, which was
organized by the Chatsworth Historical Society.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboy's Prayer
</P>
<P>
   Oh Lord, I reckon I'm not much just by myself.
</P>
<P>
   I fail to do a lot of things I ought to do.
</P>
<P>
   But Lord, when the trails are steep and the passes high,
</P>
<P>
   Help me to ride it straight the whole way through.
</P>
<P>
   And when in the falling dusk I get the final call,
</P>
<P>
   I do not care how many flowers they send _
</P>
<P>
   Above all else the happiest trail would be
</P>
<P>
   For You to say to me, ``Let's ride, my friend.''
</P>
<P>
   Amen.

TITLE MATCH PITS POWER VS. PATIENCE
</HEADLINE>

 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Fifth-seeded Andre Agassi figures to face his toughest opponent
of the Mercedes-Benz Cup when he plays second-seeded Tim Henman
today in the final, and vice versa. The two have never faced each
other.
</P>
<P>
   Agassi, 28, is on a roll with 10 consecutive straight-set
victories in ATP tournament play. Henman, 23, is ranked No.12 on
the ATP Tour, one spot ahead of Agassi, and nobody has been able to
overcome his 142-mph serve. Henman entered Saturday's semifinals
leading the tournament with 42 aces, 17 more than No.2 man Kenneth
Carlsen. He will have a decided advantage over Agassi in power.
</P>
<P>
   But Agassi, who appears to have whipped himself back into Grand
Slam form, will have the edge in savvy and experience.
</P>
<P>
   Here are some of the contrasts: Henman, of England, is a
6-foot-1 right-handed serve-and-volleyer who uses a one-hand
backhand. Agassi is a 5-11 right-handed baseliner who uses a
two-hand backhand. Henman prefers to win his points quickly with
first-serve bombs followed by volleys to an open court. Agassi
likes to spar from the baseline, patiently setting up his winners.
</P>
<P>
   Edge: Agassi. He's playing too well. In the semifinals against
Justin Gimelstob, whose style closely resembles Henman's, Agassi
made only nine unforced errors while repeatedly tying Gimelstob up
at the net or passing him with well-placed ground strokes. Henman
has been erratic with his best weapon. He entered Saturday with one
of the worst first-serve percentages in the tournament at 49
percent while winning only 52 percent of his second-serve points.

GM DUQUETTE FILLS HOLES WITH TRADES 
</HEADLINE>
 SOX-TRADES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ Red Sox general manager Dan Duquette said
Saturday he is still hopeful designated hitter Reggie Jefferson and
second baseman Lou Merloni will be back before the end of the
season, but Friday's trades for lefthanded-hitting Orlando Merced
and minor league infielder Eddy Diaz were clearly hedges against
their extended absence.
</P>
<P>
   The addition of lefthanded reliever Greg Swindell, meanwhile,
brought to an end the brief, inglorious career of David West in the
Sox bullpen. In the week he was with the team, West managed to
record five outs, but he also gave up five hits and five walks.
Also designated for assignment was Billy Ashley, who had just 24
at-bats in five weeks with the Sox.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox failed, however, to accomplish what they had
targeted as their prime objective _ to obtain another starting
pitcher. Up until the final minutes before the trading deadline,
the Sox thought they were still in the running for Seattle's Randy
Johnson, who wound up going to the Houston Astros for two prospects
and a player to be named.
</P>
<P>
   Mo Vaughn, meanwhile, took comfort in the fact that he wasn't
traded, and, in another 180-degree spin, expressed renewed
enthusiasm for staying with the Red Sox for the long term.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't start thinking about being traded until I got here
and it was three or four hours before the deadline,'' Vaughn said.
``Baseball is a big business. You don't know what's going to
happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just glad this organization gave me the opportunity to
stay with this team.''
</P>
<P>
   Even after Vaughn's diatribe a week ago accusing the club of
tailing him with private investigators and accusing him of using
drugs, Duquette said it was ``doubtful'' the club would trade him.
But as reported by the Globe last week, even before Vaughn's
outburst there were internal discussions about trading him to the
Chicago White Sox for first baseman Frank Thomas.
</P>
<P>
   White Sox general manager Ron Schueler told the Chicago
Sun-Times Saturday that the Red Sox did call. ``I'm not going to
lie about it,'' Schueler said. ``They called about three weeks ago,
but it was very casual talk.''
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn also expressed hope that it was more than casual talk
when Red Sox CEO John Harrington told Globe columnist Will
McDonough that the club still wants to sign Vaughn to a contract
extension.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm glad John Harrington did say that and was willing to put
it on the line like that,'' said Vaughn, whose performance has not
suffered during the controversy.
</P>
<P>
   He has hit in nine straight games (15 for 35, .429) since
telling the Toronto Sun his No. 1 preference was to play for the
Blue Jays. That may change when he learns that Roger Clemens's
agent, Alan Hendricks, asked Toronto GM Gord Ash to explore trading
the Rocket to a contender, a revelation that led to Clemens being
blasted in the Toronto papers.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you come down to it,'' Vaughn said of his situation with
the Red Sox, ``I hope there will be no hard feelings, no anything
except an opportunity to stay here.''
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn, asked if he had had any communications, either directly
or through back channels, that caused him to feel encouraged that
his contract situation would be resolved, said, ``By the
organization keeping me here is enough. Right now, I don't know of
any discussions taking place, but keeping me here is enough for
me.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the Johnson situation, in the end the front-runners for
the Big Unit, the Indians and Yankees, balked at parting with the
starting pitchers (Dave Burba and Ramiro Mendoza, respectively)
that the Mariners were seeking in return. The Red Sox were offering
prospects.
</P>
<P>
   ``The trade of Randy Johnson was a curious trade,'' Duquette
said. ``There were a number of teams involved, but from the
beginning the Mariners engaged other ball clubs instead of us.''
</P>
<P>
   Duquette held out the possibility that the Red Sox still might
be able to claim a pitcher on waivers in the next month. A number
of veteran pitchers went untraded Friday night, most notably Tim
Belcher of the Royals, Mark Portugal of the Phillies, and Jon
Lieber of the Pirates.
</P>
<P>
   Merced, playing almost exclusively against righthanded pitchers,
was batting .289 this season with 5 home runs in 204 at-bats, but
just .208 in 24 at-bats in July.
</P>
<P>
   Merced made his last start July 13 and had just two pinch
hitting appearances since. Merced, who signed a one-year deal with
the Twins for $800,000, had asked to be traded.
</P>
<P>
   The Twins had attempted to re-sign Swindell, who is being paid
$1.3 million this season and is eligible for free agency. When it
became apparent that the price might get too high, Minnesota
reportedly entertained offers from the Cubs, Padres, and Mets
before trading him to Boston.
</P>
<P>
   A former 18-game winner with the Indians, Swindell signed a rich
free agent contract with the Astros but wound up being released by
Houston in early June 1996. The Indians signed him 12 days later,
but he pitched poorly in Cleveland before winding up with the
Twins, with whom he had a 3-3 record and 3.66 ERA in 51 appearances
this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our need for a professional lefty in the bullpen has been
demonstrated in the last couple of weeks,'' said Duquette, alluding
to the failure of West and Ron Mahay to handle that role.
</P>
<P>
   Swindell, however, also has shown a penchant for giving up home
runs. He has allowed 10 in just 66 1/3 innings, including one to
Jose Canseco in his last appearance for the Twins Friday night.
That's more home runs than any reliever on the Red Sox roster.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn said he was encouraged by the acquisitions the team made.
``We looked at the situation and were prepared to do what we have
to do with what we had,'' he said. ``But anything (Duquette) can do
to help is good. We got some help. That's what happened. We got
some guys that can help this team. We're all glad in here.''

HOMERS HELP MARTINEZ TO NO. 15

<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ They are exactly two-thirds of the way through
the season and showing no signs of being anything less than they've
been since April.
</P>
<P>
   It's been written before: When the calendar turns to August and
the Red Sox are in playoff contention, that's when New England
feels the first chill of winter.
</P>
<P>
   But only the darkest Calvinist can take a dim view of the way
the Red Sox continue to carve up the West Coast, taking their
second straight from the Anaheim Angels, 11-3, with a bloodless
efficiency that sucked the life out of a crowd of 29,893 Saturday
at Edison International Field.
</P>
<P>
   Dennis Eckersley, for one, knows about the immutable laws of
diminished expectations back home. But he has news for those
waiting for this team _ 20 games over .500 for the first time this
season _ to collapse.
</P>
<P>
   ``That 15-game lead the Yankees have on us feels like it takes
the pressure off us,'' Eckersley said. ``Everybody treats us like
we're 15 out instead of up by six in the wild-card. We can lay in
the weeds till it's time to get after it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know if I'm the Yankees, I'd be afraid I'm (peaking) now,
and worry about losing in the first round of the playoffs. Now
that's pressure. Anybody can win a five-game series.''
</P>
<P>
   Backed by home runs by Mike Benjamin, Damon Buford, and Troy
O'Leary, Pedro Martinez joined David Cone as the major leagues'
only 15-game winners, limiting the Angels to three hits, including
Jim Edmonds's 16th home run, until weakening in the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez, winning for the ninth time in his last 10 starts,
received a huge assist from Derek Lowe, who entered after Orlando
Palmeiro's two-run single made it 6-3 in the eighth and set down
the last six Angels in order.
</P>
<P>
   ``Derek Lowe was probably the key to me getting that win,''
Martinez said.
</P>
<P>
   Lowe came on with runners at first and third and no outs and
overpowered the next three hitters, strikeouts of Cecil Fielder and
rookie Troy Glaus sandwiched around a tapper to the mound by Garret
Anderson.
</P>
<P>
   ``That all comes from Jimy (Williams) putting me in so many
tight situations early in the season, when I was able to have some
success,'' Lowe said. ``I'm very confident to go out in tight
situations. I'm relaxed. I know I can get out of those
situations.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson went 0 for 4, bringing to an end his 28-game hitting
streak, the longest in the majors this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel sorry that I had to stop it,'' Martinez said. ``But
it's a jungle out there. You have to kill to survive.''
</P>
<P>
   The Angels, meanwhile, are in major freefall, despite their
standing atop the AL West. They're just 9-19 in their last 28 games
and have lost 12 of their last 16 at home.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez, who helped himself with a snatch and throw to the
plate in the second inning when the Angels had runners on the
corners with none out, has not allowed more than three earned runs
in his last nine starts.
</P>
<P>
   ``The team looks fine right now,'' Martinez said. ``We're very
confident, we're healthy, thanks to God and knock on wood. I hope
we keep it up.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got key guys in key trades. (Mike Stanley) makes us a
lot more stable, more experienced. We're still waiting for
(Orlando) Merced and (Greg) Swindell. Things should get better as
we go along.''
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox, who have outscored the Angels, 18-5, in the last
two days, exploited a missed popup on the mound to break through
with two runs in the fourth inning, then added two-run home runs by
Benjamin in the fifth and Buford in the sixth off Angels starter
Allen Watson for a 6-1 lead. They scored five more runs in the
ninth, when they sent nine men to the plate, including O'Leary, who
hit his 19th home run.
</P>
<P>
   Buford, a native of Los Angeles, continues to confound those who
believed his usefulness began and ended with his glove. The platoon
specialist is batting .388 (19 for 49) in his last dozen starts,
having driven in 13 runs.
</P>
<P>
   Benjamin, meanwhile, missed a bunt attempt after Scott
Hatteberg's walk to lead off the fifth, then hit his third home run
in less than a month after going more than two years without going
deep.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody talked about how we didn't want to jell too soon,''
Benjamin said. ``We needed everybody to pick it up and pitch in
again, especially on this road trip.''
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox have now won four out of five on this 14-day,
12-game trip to four cities and have assured themselves of winning
their second straight series on this trek.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a lot of fun to play with these guys,'' said Stanley, who
registered his first RBI since coming back to the Red Sox with a
sacrifice fly. ``I've kept my eye on them. They've been playing
like this all year long, that's for sure. It's fun to be on the
same side.''

in the fifth inning, then drove in two more runs with singles in
the first and third innings. The first-inning hit scored Clayton,
who had stolen a base and later drove in a run in the fourth with a
sacrifice fly.
</P>
<P>
   The victory temporarily lifted the Rangers out of a funk that
had seen them lose six of seven games. It also moved them into a
first-place tie with the Anaheim Angels, who haven't been setting
the American League West on fire lately, either.
</P>
<P>
   Third baseman Zeile and shortstop Clayton were obtained Friday
in trades. Zeile was the latest Florida Marlins departure, and
Clayton came from the St. Louis Cardinals along with pitcher Todd
Stottlemyre.
</P>
<P>
   General manager ``Doug Melvin should feel very good,'' Rangers
manager Johnny Oates said. ``There was electricity in the stands. I
know the crowd really seemed to appreciate the game Todd had,
offensively and defensively.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gives everybody a pick-me-up. Other players look around and
see you've got two veterans that know how to play the game.
Hopefully, we'll carry this attitude for at least the next two
months, and see what happens.''
</P>
<P>
   Zeile introduced himself by handling a scorching Frank Thomas
liner three batters into the game.
</P>
<P>
   Three innings later, his diving stop at the foul line held Mike
Cameron to a single, saving one run and possibly two.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope they don't expect that every night, but what better way
to start somewhere?'' Zeile said. ``I guess you could tell I was
excited and enthusiastic about coming here to play.
</P>
<P>
   ``I go from the absolute bottom of the cellar to a team in first
place. No way to describe it.''
</P>
<P>
   The energy also seemed to carry over to the mound, as Rick
Helling got back on track with a decent five-inning performance.
</P>
<P>
   Helling scattered eight hits and struggled at times, but gave up
only one run, and that came with an asterisk. Texas right fielder
Roberto Kelly got a slow jump on Mike Caruso's line drive that went
over Kelly's head for a first-inning triple. That scored Ray
Durham, who led off the game with a single.
</P>
<P>
   Helling, (14-6), had allowed 18 earned runs in 23 innings in his
three most recent starts before last night.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers put the game out of reach with a three-run outburst
in the eighth, capped by Bill Haselman's two-run homer.
</P>
<P>
   Middle reliever Xavier Hernandez took over from Helling in the
fifth and pitched three scoreless innings, allowing one hit. John
Wetteland worked a scoreless ninth.

IT'S SHOW TIME FOR PATRIOTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; SAN FRANCISCO _ Sunday night the real football begins for the
men clinging to the edges of the New England Patriots.
</P>
<P>
   For the bulk of the Patriots, the Lawyer Milloys, Drew Bledsoes,
Terry Glenns, Willie McGinests and Bruce Armstrongs, Sunday night's
season-opening exhibition game against the San Francisco 49ers will
be only a brief continuation of what they have gone through the
past two weeks. It will be a dress rehearsal for a game they are
not yet fully ready to play, like a show opening in Boston or
Baltimore on its way to Broadway.
</P>
<P>
   For them this is a time for tinkering with their performances,
working on the new offense being installed by offensive coordinator
Ernie Zampese, or perfecting the defense Steve Sidwell put in a
year ago and ran so effectively at the end of the season that an
injury-riddled team came within 1 point of returning to the AFC
Championship Game.
</P>
<P>
   That game, a 7-6 loss in Pittsburgh, is one whose bitter memory
those Patriots will begin to try and erase Sunday night, but that
will not be what is on the minds of the men on the edges.
</P>
<P>
   For Vincent Brisby, Todd Rucci, Chris Canty, or the runners Shaw
_ Sedrick and Harold _ this game will be a showcase or a first
black mark against them. It will be a game in which they most often
face players the 49ers no more intend to have on the 3Com Park
field in September than the Patriots intend to have Canty or the
runners Shaw on the field at Foxboro Stadium. To change that, to
get on the field or to just stay near it, they must play this one
for real, because for them it is no exhibition.
</P>
<P>
   For a kid like Canty, games like this were not supposed to carry
with them such pressure so soon. A year ago, he was a first-round
draft choice of the defending AFC champions. He was a cornerback
with a future.
</P>
<P>
   But after struggling all season to find himself (as well as the
receivers he was supposed to be covering), Canty has come into 1998
with many questions surrounding him, but the simplest one is this _
can he or Canty?
</P>
<P>
   A job is open at right cornerback, but frankly the Patriots
don't want him to win it. They want their new No. 1 draft choice,
their new love, Tebucky Jones, to win it. Failing that, they want a
guy so often injured in his career he should be known as Beth
Israel instead of Steve Israel to win it.
</P>
<P>
   Canty is in that sweepstakes, too, and there is an opening
because Israel has continued to spend more time on a bicycle than a
competitor in the Tour de France and Jones has been limping with a
sore hamstring. But where Canty had the inside edge by virtue of
being Mr. No. 1 last year, now he's clinging to the outside, and
after a quick start in camp, already there are those saying he has
begun to fade because of tired legs and too many reps in practice
that reveal his shortcomings.
</P>
<P>
   So for Canty, Sunday night is not what it is for the man who
will start opposite him. For Ty Law, this is just a formal practice
session. Law will play little more than a quarter and what he does
during that time will say nothing about him. He is a fixture. Chris
Canty is not.
</P>
<P>
   Same is true for veteran wide receiver Brisby, who wasn't even
supposed to be here. By the end of last season it appeared Brisby
would be a salary cap casualty, a victim of too many receivers
having snuck in ahead of him last year when he never got untracked
after feeling he'd outplayed Shawn Jefferson in camp (which he did)
and not been awarded the job he'd earned.
</P>
<P>
   But Sunday night he starts ahead of Jefferson, who also has a
sore hamstring. Because of Glenn's injury history and
disinclination to join strength coach Johnny Parker's offseason
workouts fully, Brisby stayed alive all winter and has been
promised a chance to win his job back. And so he is here, looking
to show that he can still get open in the middle and catch the ball
when he does, even if he lacks Jefferson's deep speed.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Brisby understands how things work in the NFL. He knows
coaches love speed first and Jefferson has more of it, so while
this may be an exhibition for some, it is real for him. He must
shine because someone at his position won't be around next month
and because of the $1.2 million he stands to make he is still the
leading candidate for unemployment, unless he shows enough to make
the choice hard on his coaches. That process begins at 6 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   And what of the runners Shaw? With Curtis Martin limping on Long
Island this summer instead of in New England, the Patriots are
looking for a No. 1 running back. If they are realists, the runners
Shaw know the most likely candidate is No. 1 draft choice and
newest Patriot millionaire, Robert Edwards.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Sunday night Sedrick Shaw, a third-round choice who didn't
play a down until the postseason last year, starts at running back,
and rookie Harold Shaw also gets a chance to show if the first
impression he made during two weeks facing friendly fire counts for
anything when he's in with strange faces.
</P>
<P>
   If either impresses, he gets another chance to compete with
Edwards next weekend for a job that it seems has already been
handed out. Poor Sedrick knows he is running with the first unit
against one of the best defenses in the NFL because of tradition
and nothing more. A rookie does not start ahead of the most senior
man in the first exhibition game except in most unusual
circumstances, so Shaw is in with the Bledsoes and Armstrongs
instead of Edwards, and their presence is his best chance to make
this a real competition because he is less likely to get a second
chance like this if he fails to take advantage of the first one.
Regardless of what you may be told in the days ahead, this is his
moment.
</P>
<P>
   In front of the runners Shaw will stand Rucci, a guy who should
be on top of the world. Rucci has started the last several seasons
at right guard on some very good teams and signed a five-year, $10
million contract in the offseason. One might assume he feels like
the Armstrongs of the world. He does not.
</P>
<P>
   That is because there is no five-year contract in the NFL. There
are five one-year contracts, which means short of the bonus money
he got, he could be fired at any time and collect nothing. Worse,
young Heath Irwin, who comes a lot cheaper, is being given a chance
to battle Rucci for his job and will split time with him Sunday
night with the first unit.
</P>
<P>
   There is a clear message there. It is that a new contract has
not given Rucci more security than he had before, when it seemed he
was in a constant fight for his life. For Rucci and the others in
his position, that fight begins Sunday night. That is the real life
drama of games like this one, where the score means less than
nothing, and the injury report is the most important bit of
information to people watching with blind eyes.

PATRIOTS KICK IT OFF 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ After 13 days of drills, 7-on-7s, one scrimmage,
and some 50 hours of practice time, the New England Patriots get to
travel 3,000 miles to play a team other than their own Sunday night
at 3Com Park.
</P>
<P>
   Patriots coach Pete Carroll returns to his hometown to play
against the San Francisco 49ers, for whom he spent two seasons as
the defensive coordinator. Carroll termed the homecoming
``special'' this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think everybody wants to go home and play,'' said Carroll.
``My family will all be there, and there's a sense of pride you
have that you want to show off your team and show them what you can
do. We can't lose sight of the goals we have for this game, which
are really getting to watch our units play together and continue to
see the different competitions we have on our team unfolding.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have five of these, so the first game won't reflect badly
on anyone. Everybody will have some chances to redeem themselves or
put a better foot forward if they don't play as well as we'd want
them to.''
</P>
<P>
   And the meeting is also special for a few faces on the Patriots
squad, most notably sophomore running back Sedrick Shaw, who will
start, No. 1 draft pick Robert Edwards, who will spell Shaw and
probably see some third-down duty early in the game, and defensive
back Tebucky Jones, the Patriots' second first-round pick who will
spell last year's No. 1 pick, Chris Canty, and second-year corner
Mark Tate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just go out there and follow my blocks and show everyone what
I can do,'' said Shaw, a man of few words.
</P>
<P>
   One of the knocks on Shaw is that he's the most likely to get
Drew Bledsoe hurt, because he hasn't shown great blocking ability,
and is likely to come out on third down.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards, who has suffered the past week from a strained left
groin, says he's not yet 100 percent, but expects to play some.
</P>
<P>
   ``It'll be the first time I play in an NFL game, so I want to
get out there and perform,'' he said. ``After being in camp for a
couple of weeks, I'm starting to get a better understanding of the
pro game and what it takes. To play your first game against the
49ers, that's a team with a lot of great history. It's exciting
that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Carroll wouldn't commit to how long Edwards or Jones would play.
He also wouldn't reveal the number of plays the first offense would
run. A major part of the first exhibition game will be to measure
how Bledsoe and his receivers have adapted to the Ernie Zampese
quick-pass offense. Based mostly on timing, the receivers will have
to run precision routes in a game situation. Top receiver Terry
Glenn has played superbly in training camp, showing no ill effects
of a broken collarbone he sustained in the team's playoff loss to
the Pittsburgh Steelers Jan. 3. Glenn has also shown that he's
taking camp seriously.
</P>
<P>
   The cornerbacks will also be under a microscope. Canty, who is
taking pro life a little more seriously, needs to show it on the
field. Unfortunately, there will be no Jerry Rice to provide the
ultimate test for Canty or Jones.
</P>
<P>
   One place where the competition is getting stiff is the right
guard spot, where third-year man Heath Irwin is pushing Todd Rucci.
The Patriots are trying to light a fire under Rucci, who elected to
spend most of the offseason at his La Jolla, Calif., home rather
than take part in the conditioning program.
</P>
<P>
   Defensive coaches Steve Sidwell and Ray Hamilton will look
closely at the line play. Ferric Collons, Mark Wheeler, Henry
Thomas, and Willie McGinest will start, but three of the four
players may be fighting off the likes of Chad Eaton, Chris
Sullivan, Brandon Mitchell, and rookie Greg Spires for playing
time.
</P>
<P>
   Carroll is also looking to see much more fire on special teams,
which he will stack with rookies and second-year players around
All-Pro Larry Whigham, Marty Moore, and Tedy Bruschi.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right from the start we're looking for a unit that will create
some hits and maybe some turnovers,'' said Carroll. ``It took us a
while to get going last year. We'd like to have that energy right
away.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the other agenda is keeping key players such as Ted
Johnson, Bledsoe, Glenn, Ty Law, and Lawyer Milloy healthy.
Already, the Patriots' two major rivals _ Miami and New York _ have
suffered tough injuries, particularly the Jets, who have lost
linebacker Marvin Jones for the season.

AGASSI ADVANCES TO FINAL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DANA HADDAD  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Andre Agassi hasn't given the ``go'' sign yet, so
it is premature to say he has put the Las Vegas glitz back in his
tennis game.
</P>
<P>
   But the former Wimbledon and U.S. Open champion who, at the end
of last year, appeared headed for the scrap pile when, at age 27,
he fell out of the top 100 in the ATP Tour rankings, appears to be
at least regaining his identity.
</P>
<P>
   You can't call him Mr. Brooke Shields, at least not right now.
</P>
<P>
   With adolescent girls yelling ``Go Andre'' among the
approximately 6,000 at the Los Angeles Tennis Center on Saturday,
Agassi routed upstart Justin Gimelstob 6-0, 7-6 (7-2) in the
semifinals of the Mercedes-Benz Cup.
</P>
<P>
   Fifth-seeded Agassi will face Tim Henman in today's 4 p.m.
championship, taking into the match a streak of 10 consecutive
straight-set ATP victories dating to his second-round defeat at
Wimbledon.
</P>
<P>
   If one can't title this ``A Return to Dominance,'' maybe the tag
``Suddenly Andre'' would work.
</P>
<P>
   Agassi, who has climbed back to No.13, took only 1 hour, 13
minutes to dispense of Gimelstob, the former UCLA player who was
having his best year as a pro.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel pretty confident, no question,'' Agassi said, after
someone suggested he could write a nice ending to a rousing
comeback by winning the U.S. Open a month from now. ``But it's not
about feeling you're unbeatable. It's about working hard, paying
the price and establishing your game.''
</P>
<P>
   This is what Agassi established Saturday: he can still slice and
dice the prototypical serve-and-volleyer with precision. He
committed nine unforced errors in the match, only one in the first
set in which he broke Gimelstob's 125-mph serve three times. And
when he wasn't belting passing winners, Agassi was forcing 33
errors from Gimelstob by catching him out of position.
</P>
<P>
   Gimelstob, the 6-foot-5 third-year pro, started shaky with three
errors in his match-opening service, then blew his only real chance
to change the tone of events by failing to capitalize on two break
points in Agassi's first service.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I broke back that second game,'' said Gimelstob, ``the
wheels might not have come off the way they did.''
</P>
<P>
   Gimelstob, with his year-end ranking of 102, was actually much
higher than Agassi (No.122). But if Agassi is not willing to admit
he's fast approaching the player he once was _ the who has pocketed
more than $13 million in his career _ Gimelstob is.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's playing at the top of his game and moving well,''
Gimelstob said. ``I'm not going to let that loss bother me. I'm
encouraged with the way I'm playing.''
</P>
<P>
   What bothered Gimelstob was the early afternoon sun. He claims
he wasn't prepared for the glare, despite the fact that these are
the very courts on which he worked out daily while attending UCLA.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, it's an outdoor sport,'' said Gimelstob, addressing the
dilemma philosophically. ``Against Agassi, you need to be firing
your serves closer to the line.''
</P>
<P>
   In the other semifinal, second-seeded Henman of England beat
Guillaume Raoux 7-5, 6-3, ending an improbable run by the Frenchman
who upset Wimbledon finalist Goran Ivanisevic in the first round.
Raoux was trying to win his second tournament in 12 years on the
tour.
</P>
<P>
   Raoux broke Henman's second serve to lead 2-1 in the first set.
But after that it was all Henman, who broke back twice later in the
set and got the only break he needed in the second set in game four
to lead 3-1.
</P>
<P>
   Said Henman of his first career match against Agassi today, ``I
look forward to it. He's definitely someone I watched a lot coming
up through the ranks.''

Astros GM Hunsicker makes the call
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By JOSEPH DUARTE &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
PITTSBURGH _ The Randy Johnson sweepstakes came down to two phone
calls.
</P>
<P>
   The one Astros general manager Gerry Hunsicker decided to make.
And the one he made that was almost too late.
</P>
<P>
   After a frantic day of on-again, off-again trade inquiries and
counter-proposals, it was the Astros who landed Johnson, the 6-10
lefthander from the Seattle Mariners, just minutes before the 11
p.m. CDT open trade deadline.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Hunsicker could call New York to report the deal,
his deadline was down to seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Bidding against deep-pocket teams like the New York Yankees and
Cleveland Indians, the Astros were an unlikely destination for The
Big Unit, who for months had been the center of incessant trade
talk.
</P>
<P>
   Houston became a quiet player in the race only in the final few
days. And an hour before the deadline, Hunsicker says he had lost
hope of acquiring the overpowering pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not even sure I believe what's happened,'' Hunsicker said
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``With an hour to go, I really did not think we had a chance at
anything. We still had a few things (trade possibilities) going,
and this obviously was one of them. I had not heard from Seattle
for three or four hours and that was significant, because prior to
that we had a half-dozen conversations, (speaking) almost hourly.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last hour seemed like 24 hours.''
</P>
<P>
   At that point (around 10 p.m.), Hunsicker called Seattle general
manager Woody Woodward.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hadn't heard from them in awhile so I got antsy because we
obviously were dealing with some pretty stout competition when you
think about the Yankees and Indians,'' Hunsicker said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Finally, with an hour to go, I said I was going to make the
call. I couldn't stand it anymore. If we were going down and were
not going to make this happen, I told myself I would at least give
it my last shot and see if I could make it work.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier discussions with the Mariners had broken down,
reportedly because Hunsicker refused Seattle's request for
righthander Scott Elarton, a player Hunsicker calls
``untouchable.''
</P>
<P>
   Seattle informed the Astros at 10:20 p.m. that their offer _
without Elarton _ was under ``serious consideration,'' and
Hunsicker immediately alerted owner Drayton McLane Jr. and team
president Tal Smith.
</P>
<P>
   McLane agreed to spend the extra $2 million it would take to pay
Johnson's salary for the rest of this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``The next 20 minutes were like waiting for your first born,''
Hunsicker said.
</P>
<P>
   When he had not heard back from the Mariners at 10:45, ``I
thought, I knew it, the Yankees and Indians are making a
last-minute effort to up the ante and it's over.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, at 10:50 p.m., Seattle accepted Hunsicker's proposal of
infielder Carlos Guillen, pitcher Freddy Garcia and a player to be
named.
</P>
<P>
   Even after the sides reached agreement, the deal almost didn't
happen because Hunsicker made his call to New York at precisely 11
p.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``The person on the other end of the phone (at the league
office) told me that when the phone rang their clock showed
midnight (EDT),'' Hunsicker said. ``They said if I would have
called one minute later, it would have really put them in a bind
and possibly voided the trade.''
</P>
<P>
   Hunsicker also said the Astros inquired about Toronto
righthander Roger Clemens.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had some discussions with Toronto, but never got
anywhere,'' Hunsicker said. ``I don't think they were really
interested in trading Roger Clemens, by the laundry list of names
they wanted in return.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in this to win a championship this year. We're pulling
out all the stops that make sense to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   The arrival of Johnson gives the Astros a dominant No. 1
starter.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can look good on paper and it doesn't work,'' Hunsicker
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Astros are probably one of those teams that is playing
better than most people thought. Those of us that knew the talent
aren't surprised. If anything, the pitching has exceeded our
expectations.''

Intimidating lefthander carries on Astros tradition
<TEXT>

PITTSBURGH _ In an effort to bring a first World Series to Houston,
the Astros are returning to their roots.
</P>
<P>
   That can mean only one thing to fans: dust off the ``K''
placards.

   For a franchise that goes by a ``pitching-first'' motto, it's
been almost a decade since a dominating,
strike-fear-in-the-heart-of-an-opponent pitcher has taken the mound
for the Astros.
</P>
<P>
   Astros tradition begins _ and ends _ with Nolan Ryan,
major-league baseball's all-time strikeout leader who terrorized
opposing batters with a 100-mph fastball that helped lead the
Astros to two division titles in nine seasons.
</P>
<P>
   J.R. Richard, whose career was cut short by injury, set a club
record with 313 strikeouts in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   And who could forget Mike Scott, who baffled hitters with a
sinking split-finger fastball and recorded one of the most
memorable moments in franchise history with his no-hitter against
San Francisco to clinch the 1986 National League West championship?
</P>
<P>
   In a matter of one day, things have gotten even bigger _ as in
the Big Unit.
</P>
<P>
   Needing a dominant No. 1 pitcher to complete what many baseball
observers view as a turnaround from first-round playoff outcasts to
possible World Series contenders, the Astros pulled off arguably
the biggest trade in franchise history late Friday night for
Seattle Mariners lefthander Randy Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   With an immeasurable intimidation factor _ not to mention an
American League-leading 213 strikeouts in his suitcase _ the
balance of power might have taken a southwest turn. And the
excitement level generated by the Astros' latest bold move could
create the most excitement since the club signed Ryan in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   Since breaking into the major leagues in 1989, Johnson has
developed into one of the premier power pitchers of all-time. He
was only 9-10 with a 4.33 ERA in 23 starts for the Mariners this
season _ largely because of the cloud of controversy of a pending
trade _ but is 130-74 in nine-plus seasons. Johnson, 34, has lost
two consecutive starts since pitching consecutive shutouts.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of unhappy hitters in the NL right now,''
Astros left fielder Moises Alou said.
</P>
<P>
   Fear.
</P>
<P>
   That's what general manager Gerry Hunsicker had in mind when he
joined the Johnson sweepstakes this week and pulled off a stunning
coup by stealing away the 1995 AL Cy Young winner for a trio of
minor-league prospects.
</P>
<P>
   Hunsicker consummated the deal in the final minutes of Friday's
11 p.m. non-waiver trading deadline.
</P>
<P>
   ``As you look toward winning a championship nd beyond,
especially in a short series, the ability of a team to have a
dominant starter that has the potential to shut down the other team
is a terrific advantage,'' Hunsicker said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Johnson's subpar numbers, Hunsicker thinks the 6-10
lefthander will have the advantage of relative obscurity in his
return to the NL since beginning his career with the Montreal
Expos.
</P>
<P>
   ``This guy is one of the great talents of the game,'' Hunsicker
said. ``Plus the fact you don't have the designated hitter in this
league. Plus the fact I don't care if this is the NL, AL or Mars,
any lefthanded hitter that gets into that batter's box, I guarantee
isn't going to dig in against him.''
</P>
<P>
   Said second baseman Craig Biggio: ``There's a lot of guys in
this league who haven't seen him _ and a lot of guys who are going
to wish they hadn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Pitching was the cornerstone of the Astros' success in the 1980s
and last year with staff ace Darryl Kile, who left via free agency.
</P>
<P>
   But as dominant as Ryan, Richard, Scott and Kile were, none took
the club to the World Series. With improved pitching and an
explosive offense this season, Hunsicker believes the possibilities
are limitless for the NL Central-leading Astros.
</P>
<P>
   ``It comes down to pitching,'' Hunsicker said. ``We've said so
many times that pitching is really the cornerstone of every
championship-caliber club.''

WILL RAFTER'S GAME MATCH HIS HUNK QUOTIENT?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Patrick Rafter would hate for people to think he's
a sex machine just because ladies send him suggestive faxes on the
road and occasionally invite themselves up to his hotel room.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview in the current issue of Tennis Match magazine,
the fifth-ranked tennis player in the world spoke plainly about how
girls come up to his room for a drink and get a little too friendly
and he has to remind them he has a girlfriend, as if this, along
with room key cards that don't work, is endemic to life on the
road.
</P>
<P>
   What, happy hour isn't included in room service where you stay?
</P>
<P>
   Rafter is not raffish, but he's no recluse, either. The
25-year-old Australian, who will team with Sandon Stolle to try to
win the doubles title today at the Mercedes-Benz Cup, likes to go
out at night with his mates _ and not to nurse diet sodas and
mineral water.
</P>
<P>
   That much was borne out last year, after the Australians
clinched a win over the Czech Republic in Davis Cup play. After
losing a meaningless singles match the next day, Rafter admitted he
had played with a hangover and promptly apologized to Aussies
everywhere. Hey, at least he showed up, which is more than can be
said of the United States' Davis Cup ducker Pete Sampras, who
apparently gets intoxicated only on Grand Slam championships.
</P>
<P>
   Sampras' single-minded focus on tennis, and more specifically,
the four majors, goes a long way toward explaining his six-year
stranglehold on the No. 1 world ranking, which Marcelo Rios has
only recently managed somewhat to loosen.
</P>
<P>
   And therein lies Rafter's dilemma as he approaches the defense
of his breakthrough U.S. Open title four weeks hence: Does he want
to be No. 1 or have fun? The two seem to be mutually exclusive,
like baseliners and serve-and-volleyers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's very difficult to be like Pete,'' Rafter riffed
Saturday after he and Stolle dispatched Martin Damm and Jim Grabb
7-6 (7-5), 6-4 in the semifinals at the Los Angeles Tennis Center.
</P>
<P>
   In a hurry to get to the UCLA Medical Center to visit fellow
Aussie Rod Laver, who is recovering from a stroke, Rafter
nonetheless hung around long enough to add, ``There's a fine line
(between enjoying life and enjoying life at the expense of your
tennis ranking).''
</P>
<P>
   His conclusion?
</P>
<P>
   A top ranking is not an impossibility, but ``at the end of the
day, it's a short life,'' said Rafter, who rose to No.2 last year
on the strength of his U.S. Open victory and his appearances in six
other finals.
</P>
<P>
   There may be four players ranked higher right now than Rafter,
but nobody sets more hearts aflutter. ``RAFTER YOU ARE A SEX GOD''
proclaimed a banner at the Australian Open two years ago when he
was just another pretty face hoping to crack the top 50.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Sexiest Athlete'' pronounced People Magazine in 1997,
lumping Rafter with the likes of Batman's George Clooney.
</P>
<P>
   Rafter has said adjectives like hunk, heartthrob and dreamboat,
when applied to him, are mildly discomfiting. And yet he acquiesced
to a beefcake pose on the beach for the People photo layout when a
more bashful bachelor might have insisted on a nice portrait in a
tuxedo or a tennis action shot.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe around you guys he acts like he doesn't like (the focus
on his looks),'' sniggled third-year pro Justin Gimelstob, who
disposed of Rafter in straight sets in the quarterfinals of the
singles Friday, ``but when he's out at night he doesn't look
uncomfortable with it.''
</P>
<P>
   You want to talk uncomfortable, heartthrob emeritus Andre Agassi
recalled the pair of tennis shorts from his signature line a few
years back that were, in his words, ``very gripping.''
</P>
<P>
   Wedgies notwithstanding, Agassi wore the terribly tight shorts
for a few months because, as he was paid handsomely to declare in
those days, image is everything.
</P>
<P>
   If anyone has taken that torch and run with it over the past few
years it is the latest generation of female tennis pros. Led by
Anna Kournikova, that paradigm of minxhood, the women's tour is
creating the most buzz this side of Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   The popularity of men's tennis, meantime, has receded as
inexorably as Agassi's hairline. It could use someone who wears his
long hair like Pebbles Flintstone, covers his nose with snow-white
zinc oxide and generally inspires fans to spill their beers and
fall all over themselves.
</P>
<P>
   During the second set, Rafter made a bad service toss and said
to Stolle, ``Sorry, mate.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Did you hear that?'' one fan gushed. ``He's so cute.''
</P>
<P>
   But enough from Rafter's male fans.
</P>
<P>
   After the match, girls hung over the railing and moaned, ``Oh,
Pat.''
</P>
<P>
   Rafter glanced up and gave them a sheepish wave before
disappearing into the tunnel wearing a puckish grin.

SAMPRAS APPEARANCE REMAINS A GOAL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DANA HADDAD  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Mercedes-Benz Cup tournament director Bob Kramer
said he was distraught when Pete Sampras announced he was pulling
out three days before the tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Sampras, of course, is the world's No.1 ranked player and would
have been the biggest draw here since 1993, when he last played
here. His injury _ tenderness caused by the removal of a wart on
his right foot _ has been much joked about this week.
</P>
<P>
   While Kramer has no complaints about the attendance, he is
almost single-minded about acquiring Sampras and other Grand Slam
winners for 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm confident we'll get him,'' Kramer said. ``Now we just got
to get him on the court.''
</P>
<P>
   Kramer said the 1998 event will go down in history for the
number of name players who withdrew. Boris Becker, Greg Rusedski
and Thomas Enqvist also bailed out, but with much less impact than
Rancho Palos Verdes product Sampras, who notified Kramer through
his management company.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sort of knocked the wind out of my stomach,'' said Kramer,
son of Hall of Famer Jack Kramer. ``It was a brand new sinking
feeling. We worked very hard to get him.''
</P>
<P>
   Also tops on Kramer's recruiting list for next year are Michael
Chang, Andre Agassi and Marcelo Rios.
</P>
<P>
   Strong ticket sales: Mercedes-Benz Cup officials were glad the
wart on Sampras' foot didn't become a blemish on their tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Through Friday, the tournament had drawn 58,789, meaning the
final total will probably be around 80,000.
</P>
<P>
   Kramer said the event will exceed $1 million in ticket revenue
and could approach its goal of $1.1 million in receipts. A record
was set with $700,000 in season-ticket sales. No doubt they were
lured by the chance to see Sampras play here for the first time in
five years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pete really helped make the event, no question,'' Kramer said.
``But I'd rather have Pete playing and winning.''
</P>
<P>
   Say what? Agassi seemed captivated about some comments by
Gimelstob that showed up in print Saturday before their semifinal
showdown.
</P>
<P>
   Gimelstob boasting that the Los Angeles Tennis Center is ``his
house'' during his quarterfinal upset of Patrick Rafter, his
post-match comment saying Agassi ``wants a piece of me'' and Agassi
being portrayed as a sometime critic seemed to rub at the Grand
Slam champion.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was more personal than professional,'' Agassi said
Saturday, while noting that he had mentored Gimelstob and had him
as a house guest. ``Maybe he plans to be No.1 in the world. I wish
him the best.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Gimelstob, ``It's still my house. I'll let him lease it for
this year.''

CONCERN OVER PATRIOTS BUILDING 
</HEADLINE>
 NOTEBOOK-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; SMITHFIELD, R.I. _ The NFL is like an affluent neighborhood.
It has great little features like a superb TV deal, modern stadiums
that generate many millions for their owners, a worldwide audience
that generates big TV numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland will once again have a franchise in 1999. The
Tennessee Oilers will play in a beautiful new stadium in Nashville,
and also be given a new nickname. Houston and Los Angeles, which
lost franchises, will be the next two cities awarded expansion
teams, and both are building new stadiums.
</P>
<P>
   There is a spirit of cooperation between the players' union and
the ownership. There's revenue sharing, and a healthy salary cap
that pleases the players.
</P>
<P>
   Commissioner Paul Tagliabue seems to be a competent overseer of
the sports paradise, able to broker major deals and get everyone on
the same page.
</P>
<P>
   But there is one eyesore: the New England Patriots.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have such great cooperation between the teams and the
cities,'' said Tagliabue in a phone interview from Canton, Ohio,
where he was attending the Hall of Fame game. ``We have terrific
public/-private partnerships that seem to benefit all concerned.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Concerned'' is the key word.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am very concerned about the Patriots,'' he said. ``There are
a lot of people in the league concerned. It was a franchise that
went through such instability over the years and for so long there
was so much doubt whether the team would stay in New England. And
then Bob Kraft comes along and has provided such great leadership
and solidified that franchise. And now they can't get a stadium
built. His proposal is unprecedented in our league, willing to fund
the construction himself and asking only for infrastructure. My
concern is that there is such an atmosphere of frustration up there
that it's creating a failed hope of getting something done.''
</P>
<P>
   Tagliabue appears to be at a loss about what he can do. He
always hopes that owners will do everything in their power to fund
stadiums with as much private money as possible. So when an owner
like Kraft does that and gets a negative response from the State
House, what more can be done?
</P>
<P>
   Tagliabue expects to pursue a meeting with House Speaker Thomas
M. Finneran soon to revisit the issue of why he won't agree to the
Senate version of the stadium plan, which would give Kraft $72
million in infrastructure, including a buy-back plan for Kraft's
land for $20 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``I met with Mr. Finneran about five years ago and nothing came
of it,'' said Tagliabue. ``When the Senate passed the stadium bill,
I thought that was a big breakthrough for that area, but then the
House wouldn't go along with it. I've asked different people up
there why such an impasse continues to occur. In other areas of the
country, we've been able to bring the private and public sector
together in a spirit of cooperation. But it seems there continue to
be roadblocks at every turn in New England.''
</P>
<P>
   Tagliabue said that 90 days ago he was hoping that the
approximately $20 million that is at odds between the House and
Senate versions could be a gap the NFL could solve. Under the new
basic agreement, visiting teams give up their share of the gate and
the money is placed into a stadium construction fund. In order for
Tagliabue to tap into those funds, he must have the permission of
the Players' Association.
</P>
<P>
   ``I met with (union head) Gene Upshaw to see if we could use the
fund to help the Patriots, but the union would not agree to an
amendment,'' Tagliabue said. ``Basically the funds can be used only
to supplement the construction costs of the stadium. None of the
money can be used for infrastructure, and the union thought that
the Patriots had made a huge commitment to finance the stadium
privately, and that the $72 million in infrastructure was a
reasonable amount that the state would have to pay for
infrastructure.''
</P>
<P>
   Tagliabue cites Jack Kent Cooke Stadium as a prime example of
what Kraft is trying to do. While Cooke is lauded for building his
own stadium, he received $75 million in infrastructure from the
state of Maryland. New York state's legislature recently approved
$80 milllion for improvements at Rich Stadium in Buffalo. And
Seattle approved a new stadium for owner Paul Allen with a public
investment of more than half the cost of the $400 million stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``Within a five-year period from 1994-99, we'll have had
commitments to build 18-20 new stadiums or renovations around the
NFL,'' said Tagliabue. ``That means two-thirds of the league have
already solved whatever problems they had.''
</P>
<P>
   What advice does he have for Kraft?
</P>
<P>
   ``I keep telling Bob to be patient,'' said Tagliabue. ``I
thought he accomplished a lot when he got the Senate to back his
plan. I've been counseling clubs to walk the extra mile in their
communities, but it seems that Bob keeps walking into every maze
imaginable. Obviously there will come a point when he walks away
from it, and that would be a shame. The franchise finally has
tremendous ownership. He's a considerate owner who demands that the
fans come first. In everything he does, that comes across. It comes
across in the way he runs the New England Patriots, and the way in
which he's handled many of the big jobs I've asked him to undertake
for the league. He played a great role in the television deal; he
was a huge help in the labor agreement. In everything he did, he
put the best interest of the fans first.''
</P>
<P>
   Kraft's op-ed piece in Friday's Globe nicely laid out his
proposal. The buyback of the land would in turn generate a ``$1.5
million revenue stream in perpetuity, in addition to the payment of
regular taxes, to help support the infrastructure work that would
be done on Route 1 in Foxboro. Our willingness to pay in perpetuity
for the infrastructure is, to our knowledge, unprecedented in state
history.''
</P>
<P>
   Finneran, grilled by WEEI talk show host Ted Sarandis and
co-host Gene Lavanchy last week, opposed the land deal and also
said that whatever the legislature approved for the Patriots it
would have to approve for the Red Sox. Well, that would go without
saying. Both teams, vital to the community, should receive the same
support.
</P>
<P>
   However, if this situation is now beyond repair, Tagliabue feels
Kraft has an outstanding alternative in Hartford, which is willing
to make the Patriots part of a $1 billion downtown redevelopment
project in a 70,000-seat open air stadium that would house the
Patriots and the University of Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could be a high-quality situation,'' said Tagliabue. ``It's
a great example of the public and private sector coming together
for a common goal. It would be a serious alternative for Bob.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Tagliabue is concerned that the team would move out of
an area that has such a strong fan base. He believes that the
Patriots have now tied, if not surpassed, the Red Sox in local
popularity.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are such rabid fans,'' said Tagliabue. ``They have an
owner who has put a winning organization together. You hate to have
this happen to stable, productive ownerships. The people of Seattle
bought into Paul Allen's ownership even before he's been able to
show he can put a winning team on the field. Bob has already shown
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Kraft won't tip his hand. There seems no chance he would accept
Finneran's ``compromise'' of $57 million in infrastructure with no
land buyback.
</P>
<P>
   Said one person close to the situation, ``The next time he
speaks on the topic of what he'll do next, it will be to announce
he's moved the team.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Bill Parcells  &LR; was walking by some fans at Hofstra and noticed
one trying to take his picture. ``I hope you have a wide-angle
lens,'' The Tuna quipped. Parcells has been much more accommodating
to the media in this camp, including allowing interviews with
assistant coaches, which he rarely allowed in New England.
Parcells, 57 next month, sounded like a man who has retirement in
sight. ``One of these days, I don't know when _ it's not this year,
I'll tell you that _ God's going to say, `Hey, Parcells, you just
don't want to do this anymore.' I don't believe there will be any
shame in that. If it was two months from now, if it was the end of
the season, there will be no shame in that. When it happens to me,
I'm going to take a look at myself and see what I want to do.''
Parcells said he also doesn't envision himself being just a general
manager. ``I'm a nuts-and-bolts guy. That's what I like. I like
this. I never thought very much about the other thing. I'd almost
rather consult _ just call me if you need me.'' ...  &UR; Curtis Martin
 &LR; isn't due back to practice until  &UR; tomorrow &LR; . He's missed an entire
week with a left hamstring strain. The Jets don't appear overly
concerned, but they have been very cautious with their $6 million
man ... While most of New York is feeling good about Martin, WBCN
statistician  &UR; Dick Tarpey  &LR; makes a great case for why Martin is
just a good back, not a great one. Last year, 88 of Martin's 274
carries went for no more than 1 yard. Fifty-five percent of his
carries went for 3 yards or fewer. That figure was actually better
last year than it was in '96, under Parcells, when 60 percent of
his runs were for 3 yards or fewer. Martin certainly has the
ability to break the long one. Against the Bears last year, for
example, Martin gained 79 yards on 15 carries _ one for 70 yards,
the 14 others for a total of 9 ... The Jets did receive a
devastating jolt when middle linebacker  &UR; Marvin Jones &LR; , &UR;  &LR; their
leading tackler last year, tore both the anterior cruciate and
medial collateral ligaments in his left leg and will miss the
entire season. Jones was injured when a teammate fell on him during
running drills. He will have reconstructive surgery next week ...
Nebraska quarterback  &UR; Scott Frost &LR; , &UR;  &LR; now a backup strong safety for
the Jets, has looked like a man who is enjoying hitting people
after spending so many years getting hit. Frost is also being used
as a kick returner and has made a strong impression ... Meanwhile,
although  &UR; Vinny Testaverde  &LR; outplayed  &UR; Glenn Foley  &LR; in a recent
scrimmage, Parcells is still leaning toward Foley as his starter.
Parcells said he was giving Foley ``the benefit of the doubt.'' ...
The Cleveland Browns will get the same advantages as the
Jacksonville Jaguars and the Carolina Panthers in terms of
available players when they start play in 1999. An ``access draft''
will be held next February in which all teams must submit a list of
five players eligible for the draft. Teams have until Jan. 19 to
make their decisions, except the two Super Bowl participants, which
must submit their lists by Feb. 2. Each team can recall one player
from the list after one has been chosen. Of the five players, only
one player can have 10 or more years experience, and only one
player could have been on injured reserve the previous year. The
Browns will have to select 30 to 42 players. The Browns will also
have the first pick in each of the seven rounds. They'll also
receive seven additional picks in Rounds 2-7 after teams with a
winning percentage of less than .500 select. They also have the
final selection in the seventh round, which ensures they will pick
Mr. Irrelevant. The Browns will make their normal picks in 2000 but
also receive seven additional picks unless they make the playoffs.
The Browns can also begin signing free agents as of Dec. 17, 12
days before other NFL teams. They can sign a maximum of 10 free
agents. ``The plan is designed to give the Browns the opportunity
to become competitive at an early date,'' said Tagliabue ...
Preliminary bids on the Browns by prospective owners are due by
Aug. 6. The bids are expected to start at around $350 million and
go as high as $700 million.

   Patriots defensive end  &UR; Devin Wyman  &LR; is on the verge of a rap
career. He's already produced a CD on his own label. Wyman says
he's trying to get  &UR; Terry Glenn  &LR; and  &UR; Chris Canty &LR; , &UR;  &LR; both of whom
are supposedly good rappers, to join him in future ventures. ``My
music is my outlet,'' said Wyman. ``I love it. There's a lot of
things I have to say, and I can say them with my music.'' ... Now
that  &UR; Dave Meggett  &LR; will be out for the season, the Patriots may
have to pay him an injury settlement. The maximum amount is
$200,000 ... 49ers quarterback  &UR; Steve Young  &LR; expects coach  &UR; Steve
Mariucci  &LR; to allow him to throw more this season now that he's
completely recovered from his concussions. ``We'll throw the ball
more on first down,'' said Young. ``We'll line up with three and
four wideouts more on first down. If  &UR; Jerry  &LR; ( &UR; Rice &LR; ) stays
healthy, we'll probably throw 40 times instead of the 30 times we
averaged last year.'' ... With  &UR; Carmen Policy  &LR; out of the 49ers
picture, it appears San Francisco and Oakland may restart their
exhibition game rivalry again. Policy never liked Raiders owner  &UR; Al
Davis  &LR; and therefore didn't want to schedule any games against him.
The teams met from 1967-1993, but then the rivalry ended. Both
teams have the third week of the exhibition season open next year
...  &UR; Charles Woodson  &LR; is already taking the pressure off himself in
the Raider camp. Arguably the best athlete in the draft, Woodson
said, ``People are looking for me to play right off the bat. And
they're looking at me to make things happen. My only obligation
here is to the team. I know from experience that you can't please
everybody.'' ... It's no secret why so many NFL rookies get injured
in their first training camp. It's hard work, and the players they
go up against are bigger and faster. The conditioning programs of
pro teams are far superior to those of most college programs. Canty
found that out last year when admittedly he wasn't in the best
shape. An offseason with  &UR; Johnny Parker &LR;  changed that. Now  &UR; Robert
Edwards  &LR; and  &UR; Tebucky Jones &LR; , &UR;  &LR; both of whom have fought off
injuries in the early part of camp, are coming to that same
realization. ``There's so much of a difference in my body from last
year to this year,'' said Canty. ``If you think you're in shape
coming out of college, you find out pretty quickly that you're
not.'' That's why, a year later, offensive linemen such as  &UR; Scott
Rehberg &LR; , &UR; Ed Ellis &LR; , &UR;  &LR; and  &UR; Damon Denson  &LR; can now begin competing
for playing time. One player who found this out was Tampa Bay's
 &UR; Warrick Dunn &LR; . ``It got to the point at one time last year where I
just hit a wall,'' he said. ``My legs were tired, and I couldn't do
anything. To be a pro athlete, you have to be in incredible shape.
You find that everything moves so much faster than in college.''

WORLD WISHES THEY WERE HERE 
</HEADLINE>
 COLUMN-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB RYAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATHENS _ In case the boycotting United States stars are
interested, yeah, they're missed. Big time.
</P>
<P>
   The empty seats in the Olympic Stadium and the Peace and
Friendship Stadium in games not involving the host country are
obvious evidence that something is missing here, but it's more than
that. You can feel it. People had gotten used to having the mighty
NBA players around.
</P>
<P>
   This is the first time since the 1990 World Championships in
Buenos Aires that a major open men's tournament has been held
without the presence of the very best players America _ and,
therefore, the world _ has to offer. The breakthrough came with the
institution of the one and only official Dream Team in 1992, and
continued with NBA juggernauts that swept to victory in the 1994
Worlds in Toronto and the 1996 Atlanta Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   Americans simply have no idea how important the Dream Team was
in the eyes of the world. All the folks back home saw was an
average victory margin of 43 points a game. What everyone else saw
was a level of basketball that fired their imagination. They saw a
bar raised beyond their current grasp. They saw their future.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the world had gotten used to beating up on the
youthful Americans who we kept sending out to fulfill a man's
mission. Now they were confronted with reality. They had become
aware that winning major tournaments in which the US was being
represented with less than its best were hollow achievements. They
knew they would have to improve.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the world had also gotten used to playing for two
medals. Time and again you would hear, ``For us, the silver is the
gold.'' And they really didn't mind. They had come to accept
reality, and reality was that the NBA was where the greatest
players resided.
</P>
<P>
   They really don't understand why the NBA players are not here.
They don't know anything about lockouts or Larry Bird exceptions.
They don't quite understand why an NBA labor problem should be a
USA Basketball problem, and, you know what? They have a point.
</P>
<P>
   The fact is that the NBA players made a commitment, and they
should be here. The commitment was to USA Basketball, not the NBA.
There was also an unspoken commitment to a basketball world that
has come to expect, and enjoy, their presence at these events. This
is a big deal. They signed on to represent their country, not the
NBA Players Association.
</P>
<P>
   OK, technically speaking, they were taken off the team before
they had a chance to boycott. But the folks at USA Basketball had
no choice. The NBA players were rattling their sabres and USA
Basketball had to cover itself. They had to assemble an alternate
team, and they couldn't wait to see what the NBA players were going
to do.
</P>
<P>
   There actually is one NBA player here _ Australian center Chris
Anstey, who plays for Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm here to represent my country, not the NBA,'' he explains.
``I wish the American NBA players were here, but I respect their
decision. It's an individual decision on their part, although I
believe it was best for them to all do the same thing.''
</P>
<P>
   You might be wondering if anyone in the Players Association
pressured Anstey to make it a complete non-NBA tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, not at all,'' he says. ``No one rang me. No one asked me
not to come.''
</P>
<P>
   Anstey can see both the benefits and the drawbacks of not having
the NBA stars here. His own country agonizes about its place in the
international basketball world. Australia has produced some good
players (Luc Longley, Andrew Gaze, etc.), and it has had a measure
of success. But the powers that be somehow feel Australia should be
doing better. Winning a medal _ any medal _ in a tournament such as
this is almost an obsession.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why it's good for us that the NBA players aren't
here,'' Anstey says. ``It opens things up.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But we are all missing a lot by not having them here,'' he
adds. ``The fact is you always want to measure yourself against the
best _ and they are the best.''
</P>
<P>
   Without the US's great NBA stars, the tournament is heading for
financial catastrophe. The US team has played its three games
before ``crowds'' of approximately 1,000, not that anyone is
bothering to issue attendance figures for anything other than the
Greek games, which are being played before raucous gatherings of
between 15,000 and 20,000 people. There are pockets of Lithuanians,
Spaniards, Brazilians, and eminently lovable Nigerians who have
enlightened the proceedings. The Nigerians are particularly
entertaining. They bring a band, and it plays for the entire 40
minutes. They dress in colorful robes. They have themselves a great
old time. Unfortunately, their team has gone 0-3 and has been
eliminated from medal competition.
</P>
<P>
   There is no doubt that the NBA stars would have had a spillover
effect on attendance. They would have dignified the tournament.
People know that if someone other than the substitute NBA team
wins, it will be a tainted victory. Of course, all bets are off if
that winner turns out to be Greece. That would be hailed by the
Greek press as the greatest Greek triumph of the 20th century.
</P>
<P>
   ``They (the NBA stars) should be here,'' insists Donn Nelson,
the Mavericks assistant who is an assistant with Lithuania. ``I'm
working with Lithuania because Sarunas (Marciulionis) asked me to.
If USA Basketball had asked me to come, I'd work for the USA. In my
opinion, there's nothing more important than your country, and if
your country asks you to step up to the plate, you should be
there.''
</P>
<P>
   The NBA players are not accountable for the stagnation in the
international game their absence has brought, nor are they
accountable for the financial plight of the local organizers. But
they are accountable for holding their country hostage because of
league politics that have nothing to do with what's going on here.
</P>
<P>
   But why should we be surprised? Responsibility is not exactly
the hallmark of the modern American athlete, is it?

GERMAN STEROID TRIAL PUTS IOC IN DEEP 
</HEADLINE>
 NOTEBOOK-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN POWERS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Now that former East German swimmers Andrea Pollack and
Christiane Knacke-Sommer say they'll return their Olympic medals
because they took steroids, the US Olympic Committee wants the
International Olympic Committee to give them to the Americans they
beat in 1976 and 1988. And if the Lords won't do it, the USOC will
give the swimmers a special award. As more evidence of massive
state-administered doping is introduced at the lengthy trial of
former DDR doctors, coaches, and officials in Germany, critics are
urging that all East German swimming medals be revoked and their
records stricken from the books.
</P>
<P>
   Though the IOC is said to be sympathetic, it's a thorny issue.
Despite the evidence, none of the East Germans tested positive at
the Games. Recalculating the results and redistributing the medals
would be an administrative nightmare, since the DDR dominance
covered four Olympiads. And the doping scandal isn't limited to
swimming. The East German track and field teams were heavily
drugged, too. Frank Shorter, who lost the 1976 Olympic marathon to
Waldemar Cierpinski, says he has proof that Cierpinski had taken
steroids.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the USOC was aghast at recent quotes from IOC
president Juan Antonio Samaranch, who said that he had no problem
with athletes using performance-enhancing drugs that aren't harmful
to their health (``For me, that's not doping'') and that the banned
list should be ``reduced drastically.'' Samaranch said last week
that he had been misinterpreted, and the Lords have called a
special meeting this month to discuss doping.

<P>
   With the amateur US baseball team failing to make the
quarterfinals of the world championships after losing to the
Koreans, Dutch, and Nicaraguans, look for a renewed push to use
minor leaguers next time. After winning the silver in 1988, the
Americans haven't made the medal round since. With the rest of the
planet improving rapidly, Uncle Sam clearly can't keep sending
college freshmen and sophomores ... As promised, the International
Skating Union made several historic changes at this year's
congress. Besides going to video replay to help judges determine
marks, the ISU also changed the scoring system to prevent skaters
from switching places when the ordinals are scrambled by later
competitors and decided to count the qualifying round in the final
result, making it 20 percent of the total. Which means that the
long program, which now counts for two-thirds, will be reduced to
one half. The ISU also struck a blow against boredom in
speedskating, allowing four racers at a time in the long-track
distance events instead of pairs ... The US women's softball team
may have won their fourth straight world title last week in Japan,
but they got another warning shot from the Australians, who beat
them for the fourth time in four tournaments before the Yanks
prevailed, 1-0, in the final ... Looks like the day of the
seven-medal Olympic swimmer, like  &UR; Mark Spitz  &LR; and  &UR; Matt
Biondi &LR; , &UR;  &LR; could be over. The international federation has decided
to have both heats and semifinals for all events up to 200 meters,
which means another four races in a seven-day span for sprinters
competing in the 50-100-200 freestyles and the 100 butterfly. Good
for TV (and for spectators, who won't have to watch consolation
finals any more); grueling for the swimmers ... Next week's US
diving championships at Georgia Tech will mark the first time
Atlanta has hosted a nationals in a major Olympic sport since the
Summer Games two years ago. So much for the oft-stated theory that
host cities have a big edge in landing events after the Games ...
Now that France has hosted (and won) soccer's World Cup, Olympus
could be the next challenge. The French, who haven't staged the
Summer Games since Paris in 1924, are considering tossing in their
chapeau for 2008, along with Toronto, Osaka, Istanbul, Seville, and
Buenos Aires. Paris lost out to Barcelona in 1992, when Albertville
got the Winter Games. Opting out of the 2008 chase is London, which
figures the IOC won't choose another European city after going to
Athens in 2004 ... The battered yen may be causing migraines in
Japan but it proved a boon for the Nagano organizers, who collected
their TV and sponsorship revenues in dollars, paid their expenses
in yen, and ended up with a $32 million surplus. Their bottom-line
operating costs: $814 million ... Could  &UR; Ilia Kulik  &LR; be the next
 &UR; Sonja Henie &LR; ? Word is the Olympic men's skating champ is eyeing
the silver screen. Scripts and acting lessons are said to be
forthcoming, plus a move from his Marlborough training center to
either Broadway or Hollywood. Which means that the 21-year-old
Russian almost certainly wouldn't defend his crown in 2002.

   Dream draw for the US men's ice hockey team for November's
special global relegation tournament in Austria. The Americans are
grouped with the Austrians, Estonians, and Kazakhs, with the top
two qualifying for the A pool in next year's world championships.
France, Germany, Slovenia, and Ukraine are in the other group. The
Yanks, who didn't survive the prelims in this year's worlds,
haven't had to play in the relegation tournament since 1983 ...
Huge post-Olympic turnover for the US men's singles lugers.  &UR; Duncan
Kennedy  &LR; retired before the Games and  &UR; Wendel Suckow &LR; , &UR; Larry
Dolan &LR; , &UR;  &LR; and  &UR; Robert Pipkins  &LR; have all decided to move on. That
leaves 20-year-old  &UR; Adam Heidt  &LR; as the only man with Olympic
experience ... As expected, Olympic veterans  &UR; Tommy Moe &LR; , &UR; AJ
Kitt &LR; , &UR;  &LR; and  &UR; Matt Grosjean  &LR; are all hanging up the skis after a
decade on the World Cup circuit. Among them, they competed in 10
Winter Games, with Moe winning gold and silver in 1994 ... Newest
member of the US Ski Hall of Fame is Lincoln's  &UR; Diana Golden
Brosnihan &LR; , &UR;  &LR; who earned a demonstration gold medal in the disabled
giant slalom at the Calgary Olympics and won 10 world titles before
retiring in 1990. Golden, who lost her right leg to cancer as a
child, has since had a double mastectomy and has been undergoing
chemotherapy treatments. Since she couldn't attend last fall's
ceremony, Golden Brosnihan was inducted at a special luncheon in
Providence last month ... No more crash-and-burn for short-track
speedskater  &UR; Nikki Ziegelmeyer &LR; , &UR;  &LR; who's switching to long-track
after slamming into the boards in Lake Placid last winter and
nearly ending up paralyzed. ``I don't want to press my luck,'' says
the 22-year-old Ziegelmeyer, who won Olympic medals in both 1992
and 1994. ``I think the worst injury you can have in long-track is
a pulled groin.'' ... After finishing out of the women's medals at
both the Olympics and World Cup, the US Field Hockey Association
has created an elite summer league for 150 players, Olympians to
high school stars. The idea, borrowed from the world-champion
Australians, is to provide year-round competition and build a
deeper athlete pool ... Joining the growing line of Winter Games
wannabe sports like skeleton sledding and sled dog racing is ski
archery _ biathlon with arrows instead of rifles. The International
Biathlon Union and International Archery Federation are talking
about hooking up to get the sport added to the Olympic program.
They have history on their side: Ski archery dates back to 3,000
B.C. ... Why won't the Salt Lake organizers unveil their mascot
until next year? Because they don't want to repeat the Atlanta
fiasco of Whatizit?, the bizarre insect/-alien that became a global
laughingstock. ``I hope we come up with a better name,'' says
committee president  &UR; Frank Joklik &LR; . ``And we hope it will be very
plain what (the mascot) is.''

LOWE, HRUDEY PUT PAST BEHIND THEM 
</HEADLINE>
 NOTEBOOK-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NANCY L. MARRAPESE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; BOSTON _ The curtain closed last week on the careers of two
terrific players: Edmonton defenseman Kevin Lowe and San Jose
goalie Kelly Hrudey. Lowe will move behind the Oilers bench as an
assistant coach to Ron Low, while Hrudey, who worked for ``Hockey
Night in Canada'' during the playoffs, says he has reached a
three-year agreement with the Canadian Broadcasting Corp. to
provide commentary.
</P>
<P>
   Lowe's retirement at 39 likely will leave Bruins captain Ray
Bourque as the only active member of the 21-member draft class of
1979 that earned full-time jobs in the NHL. The only other possible
survivor is Mike Gartner, but he is a free agent and has no takers
so far.
</P>
<P>
   Lowe made his retirement decision on instinct. ``I just listened
to myself and knew that, although last year wasn't great, it wasn't
bad, and perhaps that's a good way to call it quits,'' he said. ``I
played my whole career on instinct and heart, and that's what I
followed. I've never quit anything in my life, and I'm quitting. It
involved a lot of soul searching. I wanted to play 20 years like
Wayne Gretzky, (Mark) Messier, Ray Bourque, and (possibly) Mike
Gartner. But this is where I wanted to begin my coaching career.
This is where my heart is and where I choose to be with my family.
But it wasn't an easy decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Lowe was the first draft choice ever for the Oilers, taken No.
21 in the first round in '79. He went on to play on five Stanley
Cup champions with Edmonton and one with the Rangers. After being
limited to just seven games last season because of an ear
infection, he ends his career having played 1,468 games, regular
season and playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   As for Hrudey, he is hanging up the goalie pads after 15 years,
the last two with the Sharks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no feelings of sadness,'' said Hrudey, whose best
seasons were with the Los Angeles Kings. ``I just cannot believe
the opportunity I've had.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Center  &UR; Joe Thornton &LR; , &UR;  &LR; who has been working out hard this
summer in anticipation of taking on a much more important role on
the Bruins this season, has added an additional challenge to his
offseason. The 19-year-old, who has bulked up from last season's
198 pounds to 225, has taken up golf. Thornton lives a 9-iron away
from The Country Club in Brookline and has become smitten with the
sport that is played by nearly all NHL players.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love it,'' said Thornton, his face lighting up like a
Christmas tree. ``It's a good pastime. It kind of kills the day.''
</P>
<P>
   Before this summer, Thornton hadn't played much. Now he is
lugging the clubs every chance he gets.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went over to Brookline the other day and they showed me what
to do,'' he said of The Country Club, which will host the Ryder Cup
in 13 months. ``I never played there. I just hit off the tee blocks
and stuff. They haven't allowed me on the course. I don't think
they would or they'd be fixing a lot of divots.''
</P>
<P>
   Thornton said he got hooked when he played in the team outing at
the end of the season at the Ridge Club in Sandwich.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody was going so I thought, `Why not?' It's fun. I like
driving around the cart and hitting the balls. I'm doing all right
on the putting. I try not to three-putt. I played in our tournament
with  &UR; Steve Heinze &LR; , &UR; Dmitri Khristich &LR; , &UR; Sergei  &LR; ( &UR; Samsonov &LR; ), &UR; and
P.J.  &LR; ( &UR; Axelsson &LR; ). We almost won the tournament. But not because
of me. We had some good golfers.''
</P>
<P>
   Thornton, who plays lefthanded, said he hasn't quite mastered
the art of the driver just yet. ``I've got a slice that's
unbelievable,'' he said. ``I aim for the rightest part of the
fairway and it goes to the leftest part of the fairway. My game is
not too good. I find all my balls in the woods. That's no fun. But
I love it.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Yankees manager  &UR; Joe Torre &LR; , &UR;  &LR; whose family has been tragically
affected by heart disease, offered some words of advice to Detroit
coach  &UR; Scotty Bowman &LR; , &UR;  &LR; who is mulling whether to return to the Red
Wings' bench next season. Bowman has been diagnosed with high blood
pressure and diabetes and recently underwent an angioplasty to help
clear a blocked artery. He is also scheduled to undergo a knee
replacement that will likely force him to miss the first month of
the season even if he decides to come back. Torre lost a brother to
a heart attack and his father to a fatal stroke, and his older
brother,  &UR; Frank &LR; , &UR;  &LR; had to undergo a heart transplant. ``Your mind
should rule your body,'' said the classy Torre. ``But you can't let
your mind get away from you. You have to do it in a positive way.
To sit around and wait for something to happen is crazy.'' Torre
said that when Frank first became ill, he too went to the doctor to
get checked out. His cholesterol was too high, so he altered his
diet and has added physical fitness to his regimen, something
Bowman hopes to do once he is able to rehab from knee surgery ...
Former Bruin  &UR; Joe Juneau &LR; , &UR;  &LR; who was one of the better players in
the Capitals' run to the Stanley Cup finals, has signed a one-year
contract with the club that will pay him $2.2 million. The
30-year-old opted for the one-season pact because he is scheduled
to become an unrestricted free agent next summer. Look for Juneau
to have a terrific season. He should lobby hard to play with center
 &UR; Adam Oates &LR; , who was a good part of the reason Juneau scored 102
points in his rookie year in Boston in 1992-93 and was a good part
of the reason Juneau had seven goals and 17 points in 21 playoff
games last season ... Nice ending to the playing career of
40-year-old  &UR; Viacheslav Fetisov &LR; , &UR;  &LR; who retired last week rather
than accept a reduced playing role with Detroit. The defenseman
started the influx of players from the former Soviet Union to the
NHL and has now returned to the team he broke in with in 1989 _ the
New Jersey Devils _ as an assistant coach under  &UR; Robbie Ftorek &LR; .
``His career speaks for itself,'' Devils general manager  &UR; Lou
Lamoriello  &LR; told reporters. ``We're just delighted to have him back
here in New Jersey. But more important, what we feel that he can
bring to our organization and to our defense.'' Fetisov said he's
very happy to be back with the Devils. ``The New Jersey Devils
showed me respect,'' Fetisov said. ``I've been in contact with Lou
for the last month. He called me and asked if there was anything
they could do to make me feel comfortable. I know I can play
another year or two. I'm the type of player who can't play 30
games; I have to play more.'' ... Count veteran referee  &UR; Kerry
Fraser  &LR; among those who think the two-referee system, which will be
implemented for some games this season, is a good idea. ``I think
there are a great many benefits to be gained,'' said Fraser, who
has been officiating for 23 years, including eight Stanley Cup
finals. ``This can help prolong a referee's career and improve a
younger official, which results in a better game. And maybe the
two-ref system doesn't allow the officiating to become such a
focus, the way it is now. ... Contrary to what people think, I'm
not an egomaniac. I want what's best for hockey, and I think that
through good officiating you can enhance the product. I've worked
with a second ref four times in preseason games over the last few
years. I have no problem with it. It promotes more coverage of the
ice.'' ... With Lowe moving behind the bench,  &UR; Bob McCammon  &LR; is the
odd man out in Edmonton after three years as assistant coach. The
Oilers have offered him a scouting job, but McCammon, disappointed
in the turn of events, may not take it. ``I haven't decided,'' he
said ... Tampa Bay, the worst team in the league last year,
continues to retool. The Lightning recently added veteran center
 &UR; Benoit Hogue &LR; , &UR;  &LR; signing the free agent from Dallas. ``We had to
fight off other teams to get this guy,'' said Tampa GM  &UR; Phil
Esposito &LR; . ``We're back to where we were three years ago in terms
of depth. We feel we've improved dramatically with these moves.
Everything is so upbeat for us right now. I wish we were playing
tomorrow.'' ... Former Bruin  &UR; Shawn McEachern  &LR; is scheduled to have
an arbitration hearing on Friday to settle his contract with the
Ottawa Senators. McEachern took the Penguins to arbitration earlier
in his career, won that hearing, and named his boat the
``Arbitrator'' in celebration of the extra cash ... Nice to see
that the Islanders are making improvements to their rink. Although
they won't have a new stadium to replace the dark Nassau Coliseum
any time soon, they are installing a new scoreboard. The $3 million
board will enable fans to see replays, something they really
couldn't do on the muddy old one ... If you haven't yet seen it
among the inserts of  &UR; today &LR; 's paper, the Globe is featuring a
1998-99 Bruins schedule alongside a poster of coach  &UR; Pat Burns  &LR; and
Samsonov, who were honored as coach of the year and rookie of the
year, respectively, at the NHL Awards in June ... Sixty-nine days
until opening night.

VALDERRAMA DEAL NEAR COMPLETION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   ORLANDO, Fla. _ Carlos Valderrama wants to join the Revolution
and rejoin Thomas Rongen, who coached him in 1996. And the
Revolution, with the worst record in Major League Soccer,
desperately want the creative midfielder.
</P>
<P>
   The deal, which would send Joe-Max Moore and David Nakhid to the
Miami Fusion, was on the verge of being completed Saturday. The
only holdup apparently was that the Revolution want to make it a
three-way trade that would also include the return to New England
of defender Francis Okaroh, now with Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know Boston, just the stadium and the hotel,''
Valderrama said while preparing for Sunday's MLS All-Star Game.
``And it's a good stadium, I like it. I also know the coaching
staff and how Thomas works. That makes it easier.''
</P>
<P>
   Could Valderrama be available for the Revolution's game against
San Jose Wednesday?
</P>
<P>
   ``First, I have to settle things with my family,'' Valderrama
said. ``I can't just move there.''
</P>
<P>
   Valderrama, who turns 37 next month, became available after a
conflict with newly hired Miami coach Ivo Wortmann the day before
the Fusion's 2-1 win over the Revolution last Saturday. Valderrama
did not travel to Foxborough and missed the next Miami game, both
victories. He was fined an MLS-record $10,000.
</P>
<P>
   Now Valderrama is seeking to rejuvenate his career and to
possibly save Rongen's position. Rongen guided Tampa Bay to the
regular-season title and Valderrama was named most valuable player
in 1996, the league's first year.
</P>
<P>
   Though Valderrama, nicknamed ``El Pibe'' (``The Kid''), has
ended his international career with Colombia, he has found a home
in the MLS. He is probably the league's most accomplished player,
with three World Cup finals appearances and a club career in
Colombia, France, and Spain. Valderrama is among the league's
highest-paid players and is about to complete the third year of a
10-year contract that includes an unspecified position after he
retires as a player.
</P>
<P>
   The exchange would also accommodate a request by Moore to be
sent to the hometown of his wife, Marta. But it would cost the
Revolution one of their best domestic players, plus Nakhid, one of
their top internationals. And, unless Okaroh arrives, it would fail
to solve the Revolution's defensive problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a desperate situation for us,'' Revolution general
manager Brian O'Donovan said. ``We have 10 games left to make the
playoffs. But if we are going to use a major chip, a young and
valuable star such as Joe-Max, to make the Revolution better, we
have to make sure we maximize its value. We have to correct a
myriad of deficiencies.''
</P>
<P>
   But the chance seems slim of Okaroh leaving Chicago. ``(Okaroh)
has become an important player on our team,'' said Fire coach Bob
Bradley, ``and he has done a great job with developing some of our
younger players.''
</P>
<P>
   Valderrama is from Santa Marta, on the Caribbean coast, and has
played mostly in Mediterranean and tropical climates. But he seemed
eager to confront New England's weather conditions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to go skiing when I played in France,'' Valderrama
said. ``You have to be able play in all conditions _ hot, cold,
rain.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Rongen: ``Carlos wants to be with someone with the same
mentality, a winner's mentality. He would like to get what he had
the first year in the league, and I would love that, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``This would also give New England fans the internationally
recognized player they have been waiting for for two years. I think
he can still do the job in this league for another two or three
years. And now he has something to prove.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The US women's national team will meet Canada in a preliminary
game at noon Sunday ... The Revolution's Salvadoran striker, Raul
Diaz Arce, will join Valderrama in the World All-Stars starting
lineup. Revolution captain Mike Burns is a reserve for the domestic
team.

SUMMER BLOCKBUSTERS FAIL TO FIND AUDIENCE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DAVE McNARY  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- The popcorn movies aren't cutting the mustard
this summer. But fortunately for Hollywood, plenty of other films
are.
</P>
<P>
   That's the stunning reality studio executives face as their most
crucial season between mid-May to late July drew to a close. Their
pricey slam-bangers, ``Godzilla'' and ``Armageddon,'' crashed far
short of expectations despite carrying ``Titanic''-like production
and marketing costs.
</P>
<P>
   But don't cry for studios and theater chains. Less expensive
fare like ``The Truman Show,'' ``Dr. Dolittle,'' ``Mulan,'' ``The
Mask of Zorro'' and ``Saving Private Ryan'' have more than salvaged
the summer.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, people went to the movies in record numbers this
summer. Revenues from Memorial Day through last weekend rose 9
percent over the record '97 summer to $1.59 billion and ticket
sales were also up 9 percent to 348 million. With most of the
summer gone, there is only one out-and-out flop -- ``The Quest for
Camelot,'' an overpriced project written off long ago.
</P>
<P>
   So if 20-screen megaplexes have become common and there's more
hype than ever, why did ``Godzilla'' and ``Armageddon'' fail to
connect? Analysts believe moviegoers are tired of
testosterone-driven end-of-the-world products, and are looking for
old-fashioned attractions like plot and character development in
movies like ``Titanic'' and ``Saving Private Ryan.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Audiences are sending a real message to Hollywood -- they want
to see great stories told,'' said analyst Kevin Skislock of LH
Friend, Weinress, Frankson &AMP; Presson. ``They're getting tired of
the gratuitous violence accompanied by wisecracks by someone like
Bruce Willis. When you see `Saving Private Ryan,' it places the
cartoonishness of movie violence into context.''
</P>
<P>
   The summer's results also mean that under-25 males, who had been
the most prized demographic, have lost their luster.
</P>
<P>
   ``The trend has really shifted away from big action films
targeted at young adult males and toward movies that appeal to at
least two distinct audiences,'' said Robert Bucksbaum, head of the
Reel Source forecasting service. ``The problem with young males is
they get bored easily.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Armageddon'' will be the summer's box office leader at about
$175 million unless it gets beaten by ``Saving Private Ryan,''
which has generated powerful word-of-mouth momentum. But
``Armageddon's'' costs were so massive -- $150 million to produce,
$80 million for worldwide marketing -- that Disney's profits will
be minimal even after contributions from foreign box office ($41
million as of last weekend) and home video.
</P>
<P>
   ``Armageddon'' will turn out to be the lowest summer leader
since 1992, when ``Batman Returns'' led with $163 million.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't supposed to happen like this. Hollywood figured
``Godzilla'' and ``Armageddon'' would each hit $250 million
domestically, based on how audiences behaved during the past two
summers toward the four leading films -- ``Twister,''
``Independence Day,'' ``Jurassic Park: The Lost World'' and ``Men
In Black.''
</P>
<P>
   Hopes for a supercharged summer heated up in early May when
``Deep Impact,'' Paramount's bargain-priced version of
``Armageddon,'' opened with $41 million. That buoyed everyone's
expectations because it matched ``Twister's'' debut in the same
1996 weekend. Suddenly, the prospect of another summer of 1994,
when ``Forrest Gump'' and ``The Lion King'' went past $300 million,
seemed achievable.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, customers decided ``Godzilla'' and ``Armageddon''
didn't deliver as promised. Their combined $300 million in tickets
isn't chump change, but both movies were backed by the two most
expensive promotional campaigns ever seen, meaning that the studios
essentially ``bought'' the first week of grosses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Godzilla'' had a hard time appealing to anyone older than 11
years old and faded like a one-day tan. ``Armageddon'' was hurt by
``Dr. Dolittle'' and the fact that ``Deep Impact'' had already
soaked up much of the interest in seeing the Earth destroyed by
space debris.
</P>
<P>
   All this has Hollywood trackers wondering about the future of
special-effects-laden movies. ``If `Independence Day' was released
today, it would have a hard time getting half the domestic gross it
did two years ago,'' Bucksbaum said.
</P>
<P>
   That would mean ``ID4,'' instead of hitting $306 million, would
wind up in the $150 million range. That's the same territory
occupied by the summer's three most expensive films --
``Armageddon,'' ``Godzilla'' and ``Lethal Weapon 4'' -- and it's a
result that's vaguely disappointing, particularly in a
post-``Titanic'' world. Taking in $150 million on an expensive film
means virtually all of a studio's revenues goes toward covering its
massive costs.
</P>
<P>
   The problem with these films may be audiences feel they're
seeing variations on the same film, according to analyst David
Davis of Houlihan Lokey Howard &AMP; Zukin. `` `Independence Day' would
clearly have a harder time now because there are a lot of films
that have been derived from it,'' Davis said. ``So we could be at
the tail end of a trend of big films about aliens and outer
space.''
</P>
<P>
   The first sign of a shift came a year ago when ``Men In Black''
became a must-see film. Though the special effects were impressive,
``MIB'' was more spoof than action film, delivering big laughs
rather than just spills and chills.
</P>
<P>
   Warnings No. 2 and No. 3 came last November when two high-priced
outer-space films, ``Starship Troopers'' and ``Alien
Resurrection,'' badly underperformed. And finally, the most obvious
indication of a shift in tastes came this winter when ``Titanic''
became everyone's favorite film as young women began bragging about
seeing it half a dozen times.
</P>
<P>
   ``Think about who goes to megaplexes -- it's mostly kids,
teen-agers, women and people on dates,'' Bucksbaum points out,
noting that the last two groups have emerged as the most critical
in determining a film's financial success. ``If you don't have
something that's going to draw women, you're really out of luck.''

MAJOR DIFFERENCE IN O'MEARA IN '98 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOE CONCANNON  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; BOSTON _ Mark O'Meara is golf's improbable dreamer. Doesn't
Tiger Woods call him his big brother? O'Meara has spent the better
part of the last two years talking about Woods, his potential, his
energy, his talent. They play practice rounds together at Isleworth
outside Orlando. Didn't Tiger shoot a 59 in the presence of O'Meara
the week before he dismantled the Augusta National Golf Course and
won the Masters by a rec-ord 12 shots?
</P>
<P>
   That was in 1997; now it's 1998. Guess what? The game's best
player is O'Meara. At age 41, he became the oldest player to win
two majors in the same year when he added to his Masters green
jacket the British Open claret jug. The guys who used to share the
distinction were Ben Hogan and Jack Nicklaus. They were 40. Hogan
won the Masters, US Open, and British Open in 1953. Nicklaus won
the US Open and PGA Championship in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   O'Meara has a chance to join Hogan in the game's most exclusive
club. Hogan is the only player to win three of golf's four major
professional championships in the same year. O'Meara's bid to match
that feat _ at 41 _ begins a week from Thursday at Sahalee CC in
Redmond, Wash., site of the PGA Championship.
</P>
<P>
   After years as one of the game's most consistent, considerate
players, O'Meara has aged so gracefully that he's shed the tag of
being the best player never to have won a major championship. Leave
that to Colin Montgomerie, Phil Mickelson, and David Duval. O'Meara
got his two before anybody noticed.
</P>
<P>
   O'Meara has won 16 PGA Tour events, but before this year his
rec-ord in golf's major championships didn't go begging for
attention. Before winning the Masters, he had missed the cut in 17
of his first 56 majors. He didn't even own a second-place finish.
Even though he has won the Pebble Beach National Pro-Am five times,
he missed the cut in blustery conditions when the US Open was
contested there in 1992. His best finishes in majors had been four
third-place ties _ in the 1988 US Open at The Country Club, the
1991 US Open at Hazeltine, the 1985 British Open at Royal St.
George's, and the 1991 British at Royal Birkdale.
</P>
<P>
   The guys on the PGA Tour have long known how good O'Meara is,
however, and they marvel at how well he's played this year. He was
a popular topic of discussion during the CVS Charity Classic, which
ended last Sunday at Pleasant Valley.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think what Mark's done has been really incredible,'' said
Larry Rinker. ``If you go back a few years, he was in a slump and
really playing bad. He came out of it and won the Honda. He could
have gone the way of Corey Pavin and Ian Baker-Finch. He's always
been one of the top 30 players out here, but he was having a really
bad year.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's just played incredibly. He's won two of the last three
majors, and he's ranked fourth in the world. I can't believe the
ranking system. I think something's wrong with it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mark's a great guy. I think he just said, `I'm going to be
Tiger's big brother. I'm going to help this kid out.' I think in
the end Tiger has ended up helping him. I think Tiger's helped him
with his attitude. You're playing with a guy who hits it 60 yards
by you, and he can beat that guy. Mark befriended him, and it's
turned out that being a nice guy has actually helped him out.''
</P>
<P>
   Blaine McCallister, who lost in a playoff at Pleasant Valley in
1986 and won there in 1989, points to the putt O'Meara made at
Augusta National to win the Masters as the trigger to what's
happened this year. ``It's just a matter of his coming into his own
time,'' said McCallister. ``The guy's always been a good player.
He's proved that over his career. What it took is one putt at
Augusta to make him realize how really good he is.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now he's gone from one of the top-echelon players to one of
the premier players. When he birdied 17 and 18, that proved to him
he knew what he needed to do. Then he goes off to the British Open
and proves to himself he can do it any time. It was a basic way of
saying, `I know what I can do.' Being a friend of Tiger maybe
inspired him a little, but I believe what happened was basically
inside Mark O'Meara.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can he win the PGA? I think he can. You look at a baseball
player who gets in that groove. With Mark, he's always had the
groove but he didn't have that extra thing that got him over it.
That putt he made at Augusta is going to always stand out in his
career as a leaping point.''
</P>
<P>
   Scott Hoch, who has demonstrated the same consistency that has
been O'Meara's trademark and is also seeking his first major
championship, said clutch putting has been an O'Meara strength.
``He's proven throughout his career he's one of the best clutch
putters there is,'' said Hoch. ``To tell you the truth, I don't
know of anyone I'd rather have putt it when we need it than him
right now. There's a lot of good putters out there, but to putt it
when you really need it, I'd want him to putt it. He impresses me
because when he's hitting pretty decent and keeps it in play he can
win. He doesn't have to hit it great to do it. I don't think many
people realize what a great short game he has.''
</P>
<P>
   Loren Roberts pointed to O'Meara's ball-striking ability and his
patience. ``He's been a great ball striker for a long time,'' said
Roberts. ``When I've watched him play this year, he's playing with
such patience. That's the key to it. He's just letting things
happen.''
</P>
<P>
   John Cook assessed O'Meara more simply. ``I think it's called
talent,'' he said. ``He's got a lot of it. He was just waiting for
his time. Sometimes things happen quickly. Sometimes things happen
slowly. It's not like he didn't do anything before he won these
last two tournaments. He won 15 times. He's one of the leading
career money winners. He's had a more than respectable career, and
then to add these two is not surprising. He just has an immense
talent.''
</P>
<P>
   Brad Faxon, a native of Barrington, R.I., who can relate to
O'Meara's record based on his own career, also put is simply.
``He's a great player,'' said Faxon. ``He's been around for a long
time, and he's got a great temperament for the game and a great
tempo for the game. He waited a long time for some good things to
happen. I really believe that having Tiger Woods as a neighbor has
helped make him a better player. They practice a lot together, and
he's not intimidated by Tiger coming down the stretch. He said last
year at Pebble Beach he knew Tiger was there and it brought out the
best in him.''

METS BEAT DODGERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The game had everything, including an unhappy ending
for the Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   But as July became August, even Saturday night's 2-1 loss to the
New York Mets in front of 42,224 at Shea Stadium could be
appreciated.
</P>
<P>
   Carlos Perez arrived from Montreal just an hour before gametime
and pitched a two-hit shutout for seven innings. Shortstop Mark
Grudzielanek, acquired with Perez on Friday in a seven-player deal,
had two hits and saved a run with his glove.
</P>
<P>
   The demons revisited Mike Piazza, who drew more boos after
popping out with a chance to tie the game in the eighth, which made
him 0 for 7 in the series against his former team.
</P>
<P>
   And though Jeff Shaw blew his first Dodger save opportunity when
he allowed a game-tying pinch homer to former Westlake High star
Matt Franco and game-winning double by Edgardo Alfonzo in the
ninth, for the first time in months the Dodgers appeared whole.
</P>
<P>
   ``We flew in on the plane today and I turned to Mark and told
him, `This is going to be pretty special,' '' Perez said. ``We're
playing in a big town for a big team.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it didn't hurt so much because the Dodgers stole a victory
from the Mets the night before when Piazza let the tying run score
on a not-so-wild pitch in the ninth. But the three teams ahead of
the Dodgers in the wild-card race, Chicago, San Francisco and the
Mets, all won.
</P>
<P>
   Perez's contribution, however, was quite a boost. Already this
season, the Dodgers have lost Ramon Martinez, Hideo Nomo and Ismael
Valdes from the starting rotation.
</P>
<P>
   And the flamboyant Perez arrived with a style that is unique.
While Grudzielanek came straight to the ballpark after the plane
landed, Perez was met by his mother, who lives in New York, and
taken to lunch.
</P>
<P>
   He hadn't pitched in a week after suffering a broken nose in an
automobile accident. Hadn't even played catch or run a sprint. Then
he showed up, was introduced to his new manager, Glenn Hoffman, and
said he was ready to pitch.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since Sunday, I did nothing,'' Perez said. ``I couldn't. I
knew my control would be a little off (six walks), but I figured
everything would be fine.''
</P>
<P>
   He also gave the Dodgers an early glimpse of the on-field antics
that often get him in trouble with opposing teams. When
Grudzielanek saved a run in the third by going behind second to rob
Brian McRae of a base hit, Perez danced off the mound.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have been telling me to change my whole career,'' said
Perez, who was 7-10 with a 3.75 in 23 starts with Montreal. ``Even
a manager in the minors said I needed to tone that down if I was
going to make it. I'm better, but I still let stuff out.''
</P>
<P>
   Perez left after seven innings with the game scoreless, but the
Dodgers got an unearned run against Rick Reed (12-7) in the eighth.
With two outs, pinch hitter Alex Cora reached on an error by second
baseman Luis Lopez and scored on a double by Eric Young.
</P>
<P>
   For Young, it was the second consecutive night he had a
critical, late-inning, RBI double. He drove in the game-winning run
Friday in his first game since coming off the disabled list.
</P>
<P>
   ``Another big part of the trade was getting EY back,'' Eric
Karros said. ``We didn't want to lose Wilton Guerrero, but having
EY in there puts another piece of our team in place.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mets had a chance to tie the game in the eighth against
Scott Radinsky when Alfonzo singled and John Olerud reached on an
error by Grudzielanek. But Antonio Osuna came on and retired the
next three batters to end the inning.
</P>
<P>
   Shaw was nine for nine in save opportunities since joining the
Dodgers at the All-Star break. He got the first out of the ninth
when Young made a great, over-the-shoulder catch on a ball hit by
Lopez.
</P>
<P>
   Franco, who had three pinch homers last season, was next, and he
crushed a 1-0 slider into the right-field stands. Shaw then walked
pinch hitter Todd Hundley and pitching coach Charlie Hough came to
the mound.
</P>
<P>
   Shaw was appearing in his third consecutive game, but he claimed
that was no excuse. He struck out new Met Tony Phillips, but
Alfonzo followed by doubling home Hundley.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made two bad pitches and they beat us,'' Shaw said. ``I
wasn't tired. I told them that. Things have been going well and I
wanted the ball. Now I'll just start on another run.'' &QL;

   Dues? Bob Ferguson can tell you about those he's paid.
</P>
<P>
   About his days as a training camp gofer.
</P>
<P>
   Or selling season tickets to church groups.
</P>
<P>
   Or traveling the country, dragging NFL prospects out of homes,
bars and Lord knows where else, just to measure their vertical

<P>
   Determination? Ferguson can tell you about that.
</P>
<P>
   About groveling for a job in pro football while working nights

</P>
<P>
   Bravado? Sure, Ferguson has a little of that, too.

<P>
   Ferguson has seen these things happen and he believes. His high
school team in Federal Way, Wash., was a perennial loser but won
the conference championship by his senior year. The University of
Washington was 1-9 his freshman year but improved to 8-3 by his
junior year. The Buffalo Bills were horrid when Ferguson was hired
as a personnel man, but eventually went to four Super Bowls.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time I've gone into something, it was (expletive) and
then got better,'' he said. ``Reclamation projects, call them what
you will. You have to believe, and I believe. You have to roll with
the punches and do things differently in every spot you're in. And
you have to have some used car salesman in you.''
</P>
<P>
   Ferguson is large, opinionated, occasionally emotional and often
funny. He has injected some personality into an organization that,
with the exception of Buddy Ryan's two-year regime, has been as
staid as Queen Elizabeth II.
</P>
<P>
   At news conferences, ``Fergie'' stands behind the podium like a
preacher behind a pulpit, telling a faithless congregation of
reporters that the Cardinals know what they are doing. His size and
sincerity keep them from laughing aloud.
</P>
<P>
   After selecting defensive end Andre Wadsworth with the the third
overall pick in April's draft, Ferguson met the press and actually
cried because he was so overjoyed with the pick. He joked about it
later, but in that moment, it was obvious how much the job meant to
him.
</P>
<P>
   Ferguson is being lauded across the league for the team's
off-season moves. The team traded down one pick in the draft to
take Wadsworth, receiving from San Diego wide receiver/returner
Eric Metcalf, linebacker Patrick Sapp, a second-round choice and a
first-round pick next season.
</P>
<P>
   The club also traded a third-round pick to the New York Jets for
running back Adrian Murrell and a seventh-round pick, shoring up
another weakness.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the team has succeeded in re-signing its own free
agents. In Ferguson's two seasons with the team, the Cardinals have
re-signed All-Pro players such as fullback Larry Centers,
cornerback Aeneas Williams and defensive tackle Eric Swann. &QL; 
Many experts think the Cardinals will dramatically improve on their
4-12 record of last year, and the off-season decisions made by
Ferguson and others are the main reasons.
</P>
<P>
   In its preseason issue, ``Pro Football Weekly'' predicted, ``If
(owner) Bill Bidwill and his sons keep the team of Coach Vince
Tobin and front office executives of Bob Ferguson and Rod Graves
together, they could end up with a big winner in time.''
</P>
<P>
   Others believe Ferguson should be a contender for Executive of
the Year, which he thinks is ridiculous. ``Right here with all
that,'' he told a local radio show host who dared suggest it.
</P>
<P>
   There is little doubt, however, that Ferguson's leadership has
contributed to the renewed optimism surrounding the franchise. It's
a franchise that hasn't had a winning season since moving to
Arizona 10 years ago, hasn't been to the playoffs in a non-strike
year and hasn't won a playoff game since 1947.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think one of the biggest problems in the past was I don't
think anybody, or the right person, had full rein on the situation,
to make put-your-foot-down type decisions,'' Centers said. `I think
Bob Ferguson is really making an effort to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Ferguson is not an autocrat, however. Bidwill is still active in
personnel decisions. Michael Bidwill, son of the owner and a team
vice president, carries great influence. Tobin's opinion still
counts heavily. Bill Bidwill Jr., another vice president, is
involved in personnel decisions, and Graves, who works in
personnel, has input.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guys I owe a lot to are Mr. Bidwill and Vince,'' Ferguson
said. ``Vince is a major, major reason I'm here. I love them both.
I sincerely mean that.''
</P>
<P>
   Ferguson isn't just making a sales pitch. When Ferguson was
fired as the director of player personnel for the Denver Broncos,
Bidwill gave him a chance when jobs around the league were scarce.
</P>
<P>
   Ferguson was hired temporarily at first. The Cardinals had no
one directing football operations and needed help through free
agency and the draft. Tobin and Ferguson found they worked well
together, and with the support of the head coach, Ferguson was
hired full time. In early 1997, he was promoted to his current
position.
</P>
<P>
   ``He doesn't have a big ego that everything has to be one way,''
Tobin said. ``He has opinions, which you need to have and you need
to feel strongly about them, but you have to have the ability to
work within an organization and arrive at what's best for an
organization.''
</P>
<P>
   With the exception of his wife, Colleen, and three daughters,
the Cardinals are Ferguson's life. He has no hobbies, and he's not
good on vacations.
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes him about a week just to relax,'' Colleen Ferguson
said. ``He used to tell me that we'd get to do this or do that in
the off-season. It took me about four years to realize there is no
off-season. He's obsessed with it, but I love it, too, and it's
always been fun for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if he had the time, Ferguson is useless around the house.
He can't fix much _ she's the one with the toolbox, not him. ``His
answer to everything is duct tape,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Once Ferguson volunteered to trim a bush and left it with a
gaping hole, displaying the brown branches and leaves near the
stem. He solved the problem with a can of green spray paint.
</P>
<P>
   Football has always been the one thing Ferguson knew. He tried
living without the sport once, and it didn't work.
</P>
<P>
   An overachieving 210-pound college linebacker, Ferguson
succeeded because he was smart and devoted to the game. He tried
out for the San Diego Chargers but failed a physical because a torn
leg muscle gave him ``drop-foot syndrome,'' forcing him to wear a
brace, which didn't exactly work with his favorite shoes, a pair of
Beatle boots.
</P>
<P>
   He played some games as a scab when a strike stopped the 1974
NFL season, but that was the end of his playing career. He bounced
around a bit after that, even living for a time in Hawaii with a
buddy, making and selling puka shell necklaces on the beaches.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was trim, lean and good-looking then,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Today, he is far heavier than his playing weight of 210 pounds,
although he tries to exercise when he can.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see him walking every day, but he never seems to lose
weight,'' Centers said, jokingly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, it took me 10 years to look like this, and it's going to
take me maybe that long to get back to where I was,'' Ferguson
responds. &QL; 
Ferguson eventually returned to Seattle, taking a bartending job.
The city had just been awarded a franchise, and every day on his
way to work, Ferguson stopped by the office of Herman Sarkowsky,
one of the Seahawks owners, and bugged his secretary for a job.
</P>
<P>
   One day, she pointed to five bags full of letters requesting
season tickets, and a career in pro football started.
</P>
<P>
   ``I sat on Sarkowsky's floor for about two weeks and just
circled addresses and names,'' Ferguson said. `And they kept me
around.''
</P>
<P>
   Ferguson did anything and everything. He answered mail, tended
bar for the owners, drove their cars to Florida. He and another guy
went to the Kingdome when it was being built and measured each row
and estimated how many seats the place could hold. When training
camp started, he and Rick Thompson, now the Seahawks assistant
player personnel director, were assistants.
</P>
<P>
   In his tenure with the Seahawks, Ferguson also worked in group
sales (``I was great with church groups''), directed special events
and was even in charge of the cheerleaders for a year.
</P>
<P>
   With the Seahawks, he learned the value of paying attention to
detail. Once, Ferguson was sticking address labels on about 2,000
envelopes containing questionnaires to prospective players. Dick
Mansperger, who worked in player personnel, dropped in and noticed
some of the labels were crooked.
</P>
<P>
   He chewed out Ferguson. ``And he was right,'' Ferguson said.
``His point was that one of the kids who got a letter with a
crooked label would think, `Those guys don't care.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, the long hours took a personal toll. Ferguson's
first marriage was failing and he decided to get out of football
for a while. He held several jobs, including selling radio
advertising, driving a beer truck and serving as a public relations
director for a professional hydroplane team.
</P>
<P>
   Divorced and working as a salesman, he dropped into a men's
store in Bellevue, Wash., one day to see if he could sell some air
time. The manager, a woman named Colleen, caught his eye. ``I
thought I was pretty hot stuff,'' Ferguson said. ``I went in and
bought three pairs of slacks and made her measure my pants.''
</P>
<P>
   Colleen thought the Ferguson was a little cocky, but there was
something about him she liked. ``I thought he looked like Robert
Redford,'' she said. ``You can tell how long ago that was. He's put
on a few, but I still see him that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Colleen, who had two daughters from a previous marriage, and
Ferguson married and became parents of another daughter. All three
will ``knock your (uh, socks) off with football knowledge,''
Ferguson said.
</P>
<P>
   While Ferguson was out of football, Gil Brandt, personnel
director in Dallas, and others were trying to lure him back.
Ferguson took a job working for a four-team scouting combine, which
included Dallas, Seattle, Buffalo and San Francisco. Ferguson
lugged around a black box containing all the equipment he needed,
and he traveled everywhere and anywhere to test players.
</P>
<P>
   Ferguson searched for players on the main highways of college
football and along its dirt roads. He worked out one kid in a
driveway. He found players when and where they didn't want to be
found. On draft day, he'd wait by the phone for someone such as
49ers Coach Bill Walsh or Cowboys Coach Tom Landry to call for
information.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did it for about three years, and it was great,'' Ferguson
said.
</P>
<P>
   He worked for the Cowboys for two seasons and then was offered a
job in Buffalo.
</P>
<P>
   The Fergusons were married in Buffalo and stayed for eight
seasons. He held various personnel positions, including assistant
general manager under Bill Polian, who is with the Colts. The Bills
were awful when Ferguson joined, and owner Ralph Wilson was
unpopular with fans, as is his counterpart here, Bill Bidwill.
</P>
<P>
   The Buffalo front office decided to take chances to attract
quality players. ``We figured, what the hell, we were in Buffalo
anyway,'' Ferguson said.
</P>
<P>
   Through astute drafts and trades, and a little luck, they built
a Super Bowl team.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, Polian was fired and Ferguson went to Denver, where
he was player personnel director. He was ripped for many moves,
including trading first- and third-round picks for receiver Mike
Pritchard.
</P>
<P>
   But he also made some savvy moves. He took center Tom Nalen, who
made the Pro Bowl last year, in the seventh round. Receiver Rod
Smith, signed as a rookie free agent, has become one of the better
deep threats in the league. Thirteen starters on last year's Super
Bowl champion team were acquired during Ferguson's tenure.
</P>
<P>
   Ferguson, however, knew his days were numbered with Coach Mike
Shanahan was hired in 1995. Shanahan wanted control of personnel
decisions and eventually fired Ferguson, who holds no grudges.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best thing that ever happened to Denver was Mike
Shanahan,'' Ferguson said.
</P>
<P>
   That's what some people are saying about Ferguson and the
Cardinals, although he dismisses such talk and admits the team
hasn't accomplished anything yet.
</P>
<P>
   But it will, Ferguson said, you just have to believe. The former
puka shell necklace salesman/training camp gofer/vagabond scout
does.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will build a stadium in this Valley,'' he said. ``When?
Hopefully, soon. We have to win. And if they give me the chance, I
know what we can do to get there.'' &QL;

TOBIN'S TURN TO SHOW WHO RULES ROOST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN BICKLEY  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   FLAGSTAFF _ He has been ridiculed by a former player for
conducting a sing-along with his soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   He has been categorized as a quiet strategist, more bland than a
scoop of vanilla, a man who wouldn't know the first thing about
whipping his players into a mad-dog frenzy.
</P>
<P>
   Well, Mr. Beige has had enough. And this is a good thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got a fiery side,'' Vince Tobin says, edge in his voice.
``I'm in charge of this football team. I'm going to run this
football team. I've never been accused of not having a fiery side.
If anything, I have to work on my temper.''
</P>
<P>
   To the contrary. What Tobin needs to do is whip more tail, throw
some chairs, get in the face of players who need to learn about
toughness. And if he's really got a problem with anger management,
hey, this is football. Let it all hang out.
</P>
<P>
   When El Nino hit Cardinals' camp on Friday, when Tobin and Eric
Swann engaged in a heated argument at midfield, it may have been
nothing more than a pair of overheated engines. Or it may have
marked a turning point in Tobin's tenure. The day when Tobin
recognized the chaos, the lack of cohesion and commitment, and saw
the need for General Patton. Or, at the very least, an infusion of
Ditka.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, by the time the Cardinals arrived for their first
scrimmage on Saturday, everyone was downplaying the confrontation.
But one player said Swann's refusal to practice was directly
related to the work ethic of Simeon Rice, who has once again missed
much practice time under the pine trees.
</P>
<P>
   Rookie year, he was a hold-out. Last year, altitude sickness.
This year, bronchitis.
</P>
<P>
   Still, as Rice coughed all over the artificial turf on Saturday,
it was fairly obvious the ailment was genuine. It was also obvious
that both men went out of their way to avoid each other during
Saturday's festivities, an exercise in which both were spectators.
</P>
<P>
   Swann, handed a $25 million contract with a $7.5 million bonus
in the off-season, should know better than to walk out of a
practice session, regardless of motive. But this is the tantrum
stage of training camp, when two-a-days fray the nerves, and
everyone gets a mulligan.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're cool,'' Rice said of his teammate. ``I don't feel like
there's a rift. But I don't know. I can only go on my own merits
and pursue what I'm pursuing. I've never really known him on a
friend level, but as a teammate, he's been cool.''
</P>
<P>
   What all of this represents is something much larger than
whether a silly feud exists. It is the reason why people question
the Cardinals' mental toughness, the leading theory why they have a
special knack for losing all the close games. They are simply
leadership-deficient on defense, and this is where Tobin comes in.
</P>
<P>
   He must take the reins, command respect, serve as the lightning
rod. He must instill fear, produce passion, be the man. If not,
then who? Andre Wadsworth?
</P>
<P>
   No one says players must get along to succeed. As Tobin can
attest, the fury of those great Bears defenses in the 1980s was
simply an extension of the locker room acrimony. But there has to
be one man who stands above the rest, one voice that transcends
everything.
</P>
<P>
   ``But if you don't have it in you,'' Rice said. ``It's going to
seem flawed.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, it must be legitimate, and that's the rub. There are
defensive coordinators, there are head coaches and there are men
who never make the transition. Despite all of his experience and
chalkboard ingenuity, Tobin has never distinguished himself as a
leader of men.
</P>
<P>
   Until Friday, that is, when Tobin displayed a side rarely seen
by veteran bird watchers. And later that night, he addressed the
team, clearing the air of any lingering animosity.
</P>
<P>
   No doubt, this is a pivotal year for the Cardinals. For the new
stadium. For the head coach's future in the Valley. Maybe Tobin
senses the urgency, sees the void. And we can only hope that Mr.
Beige has a little Lombardi in him, after all. &QL;

HORNADAY ANGRY HE WAS KNOCKED FROM RACE 
</HEADLINE>
 RACING NOTEBOOK-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL VEGA  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; BOSTON _ Jack Sprague says it wasn't anything intentional. The
bumping incident he had with Ron Hornaday on Lap 171 of Thursday
night's NASCAR Craftsman Truck Series race at Indianapolis Raceway
Park was, as most drivers are wont to say after a racing incident,
``just one of them racin' deals.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem with that, however, is that if you ask Hornaday, it
was far from being ``just one of them racin' deals.'' It wasn't
even close.
</P>
<P>
   As he was racing Lonnie Rush for second place, Hornaday's run
came to an abrupt halt when he was clipped from behind by Sprague
and spun and crashed into the wall. Sprague surged to the lead and
eventually won the race, vaulting over Hornaday to take the lead in
the NCTS point standings, 2,199 to 2,167.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was trying to get around the No. 10 truck _ high and low _
and I made a move on the bottom,'' said Hornaday, who entered with
the points lead after having won his fifth race of the season at
Pikes Peak, Colo., last Saturday. ``Jack charged in there (in Turn
1) and turned me. It's a long season _ if that's the way we are
going to race the rest of the season, then that's fine. I'm sure he
sees it different.''
</P>
<P>
   Hornaday will no doubt let his driving settle any differences
with Sprague when the two arrive at New Hampshire International
Speedway Sunday for the resumption of racing in Race 12 of the
NASCAR Craftsman Truck Series.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, I hated that deal with Ron,'' said Sprague, driver
of the No. 24 GMAC Financial Chevrolet. ``I was underneath him down
the front straightaway and I felt I was over the lane and I don't
feel like I did anything wrong. ... I hate it for Ron, because I
damned sure didn't want to wreck him. Like I said, there was
nowhere I could go.''
</P>
<P>
   But once the accident occurred, Hornaday knew where to go, by
diving into the pits. Hornaday climbed from his truck, which
sustained serious damage to the rear deck, and walked over to
Sprague's pit area, where he engaged Sprague's crew chief in a
heated discussion. NASCAR officials intervened, and the parties
were pulled apart before the altercation came to blows.
</P>
<P>
   ``IRP's been good to me,'' Hornaday said. ``But Jack wasn't
tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Sprague, ``I hope Ron looks at the tape and sees that I
didn't do nothing wrong. I mean, I was on the bottom (of the
track), and we normally run the third lane. I really didn't think
he'd come there, or I wouldn't have stayed there. He did come down
and I couldn't get out of there, got into him, and he spun. It's
cool that we got the points lead back and I'm happy for everybody,
but I hate that that situation happened. I really do. I don't drive
that way.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Indy was a hotbed of racing activity last week, with the trucks
at IRP Thursday night, the International Race of Champions season
finale at Indianapolis Motor Speedway Friday, and the NASCAR
Winston Cup series making its whistlestop for Saturday's Brickyard
400. But the return to Indy was particularly bittersweet for  &UR; Al
Unser Jr. &LR; , who would've preferred Friday to be racing open-wheel
CART cars at Indy instead of one of the 12 identically prepared
IROC Firebird Trans Ams. ``Anytime you get to run at the
Indianapolis Motor Speedway, it's a dream come true,'' said Unser,
a two-time winner of the Indy 500 who had not taken a lap around
the 2.5-mile oval since his unsuccessful qualifying attempt in
1995. ``But I wish it was in an open-wheeler, a Champ car.'' But
because of CART's lingering feud with the fledgling Indy Racing
League, founded by IMS president  &UR; Tony George &LR; , &UR;  &LR; Unser has not had
the opportunity to do so. Will he get the chance before calling it
a career? ``My feeling is there is always hope,'' said Unser, 36,
who finished second in Friday's IROC race. He was heartened by the
wild fan reaction he received when he turned out to support cousins
 &UR; Robby Unser  &LR; and  &UR; Johnny Unser  &LR; during their time trial
qualifications for the 1998 Indy 500. ``I came down pit road, and I
was overwhelmed,'' Unser recalled. ``I wasn't sure what to expect
with the crowd.'' ... Winston Cup driver  &UR; Mark Martin  &LR; clinched his
fourth IROC title in the last five years and his third in a row by
winning Friday's inaugural race at Indy. ``I really wanted to make
it four championships because I can't believe it's anything but
luck with these kinds of drivers in this kind of race,'' Martin
said. ``My luck is going to run out one of these days.'' Martin had
86 points to finish 29 ahead of Roush Racing teammate  &UR; Jeff Burton
 &LR; in the final IROC standings, which paid Martin a $225,000 purse.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Last week's US 500 at Michigan Speedway would have gone down as
the best CART race of the season _ especially after the
breathtaking 62 lead changes, which set a series record _ but,
tragically,  &UR; Greg Moore's  &LR; stirring last-lap pass of  &UR; Jimmy Vasser
 &LR; was rendered an afterthought in the wake of an accident that
killed three spectators and injured six others, five of whom were
released from a Detroit area hospital last week. The fatalities
took place with 75 laps to go when  &UR; Adrian Fernandez's  &LR; car lost
control as it traveled through Turn 4 at more than 200 miles per
hour. It slammed the wall and sustained heavy suspension damage
from an impact that, onboard sensors indicated, measured 92Gs.
Fernandez's right front tire and pieces of suspension debris were
catapulted over the 11-foot high catch fence and sailed into the
grandstands, killing  &UR; Kenneth Fox &LR; , &UR; Michael Terry Tautkus &LR; , &UR;  &LR; and
 &UR; Sheryl Ann Laster &LR; . Fernandez, who had won his first career pole
at Michigan, had yet another career milestone tied to yet another
tragedy. His first career victory in the Molson Indy Toronto two
years ago was overshadowed by the race fatalities of driver  &UR; Jeff
Krosnoff  &LR; and a track worker who was killed when Krosnoff's
airborne car careened off track. ``I can only express the deep
sorrow felt by everyone within the CART community,'' CART chairman
Andrew Craig said in a statement. ``There is, of course, nothing
that we can say or do that in any way will reduce the deep sadness
felt by the families and friends of the victims.''

STINNETT BRUISES MILWAUKEE  
 D-BACKS CATCHER'S RUN-IN SPARKS COME BACK VICTORY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DON KETCHUM  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MILWAUKEE _ Of all the hits the Diamondbacks had Saturday night,
the biggest was not Yamil Benitez's home run to lead off the fifth
inning. Nor was it Andy Fox's double in the second inning.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest was by Kelly Stinnett in the third inning. And he
didn't have to use his bat.
</P>
<P>
   Stinnett, a former all-state quarterback at Lawton (Okla.) High
School and a former Milwaukee Brewer, sent Brewers catcher Bobby
Hughes sprawling with a crunching body-block, knocking the ball
loose in the process and scoring Arizona's first run.
</P>
<P>
   Hughes seemed to be in a fog the rest of the night. He was
caught napping when Andy Fox sprinted from third for the uncovered
plate to score the tying run in the eighth. And Hughes' passed ball
a few moments later on Bernard Gilkey's strikeout allowed Danny
Klassen to score what proved to be the winning run in Arizona's 5-4
victory at Milwaukee County Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks' third straight victory raised their record to
41-69, while Milwaukee fell to .500 at 55-55.
</P>
<P>
   Stinnett played with Hughes in the minor leagues in the Brewers'
system the last few years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel for him. I've been there, had tough nights myself,''
Stinnett said.
</P>
<P>
   But business is business.
</P>
<P>
   Stinnett was at first base after leading off with a single off
left-hander Rafael Roque, making his first major league start.
Stinnett took off when Andy Fox hit a sharp double into the
right-field corner.
</P>
<P>
   The ball bounced off the fence a little farther than right
fielder Jeromy Burnitz anticipated, and Stinnett kept his legs
churning around third base. The ball got to Hughes just before
Stinnett did, and . . . boom! Contact between the 5-foot-11,
195-pound Stinnett and the 6-4, 237-pound Hughes.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the very first time I ever had to do that, and I
really had nowhere to go,'' Stinnett said. ``Usually, the catcher
gives you one side (of the plate). You never want to do it, but you
have to. I have a pretty low center of gravity and I got under his
neck a little enough to knock the ball loose.''
</P>
<P>
   Stinnett never has been on the receiving end of such a play,
``knock on wood,'' he said, tapping his knuckles on the edge of his
wood dressing cubicle.
</P>
<P>
   The Brewers still held a 3-1 lead at that point, thanks to a
three-run homer in the first inning by Burnitz off right-hander
Clint Sodowsky, making his first start of the season after the
trade of right-hander Willie Blair and catcher Jorge Fabregas to
the New York Mets on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Benitez's homer to lead off the fifth and an RBI single by Karim
Garcia tied the game at 3, but Brewers relief pitcher Bronswell
Patrick hit a home run off right-hander Felix Rodriguez to lead off
the Milwaukee fifth for a 4-3 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Fox led off the eighth with a single to right off Milwaukee
right-hander Chad Fox. Klassen then laid down a bunt, which third
baseman Jeff Cirillo fielded and threw to second baseman Fernando
Vina, who was covering the bag at first. The throw was a bit wide,
tipped off Vina's glove and rolled down the line into shallow left.
Klassen was given a hit, but Cirillo was charged with an error on
the throw, allowing Fox to advance to third.
</P>
<P>
   That's when things got confusing.
</P>
<P>
   Hughes had gone to cover third as Cirillo charged on the bunt.
Andy Fox saw Hughes standing near him and nobody covering the
plate. Vina still had the ball and Hughes, the most likely person
to call time, had not done so nor made a move to go back to the
plate.
</P>
<P>
   Fox sprinted home to score the tying run and the fans sent a
cascade of boos onto the field. It got even worse later when Gilkey
swung at a pitch from Eric Plunk for strike three and the ball went
through Hughes' legs, allowing Klassen to score to make it 5-4.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't see anyone call time, so I looked over at Butter
(third-base coach Brian Butterfield) and took off. I thought I
could make it, even though you're not really sure in those
situations when someone is going to call time. I take a lot of
pride in my baserunning. Fortunately, this worked out.'' &QL;

GORDON COMES UP BIG AT BRICKYARD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK ARMIJO  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ Such a small man to win such a big race.
</P>
<P>
   And now mighty Jeff Gordon, all 5-feet-7 and 150 pounds of him,
has won it twice.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon, with much of the state and an estimated crowd of 320,000
cheering his every move, again won the Brickyard 400 on Saturday at
Indianapolis Motor Speedway, edging runner-up Mark Martin by a
scant 0.404 of a second in a race that finished under an
anticlimactic caution flag.
</P>
<P>
   It took nearly all of Gordon's strength to hoist a large
winner's trophy over his head.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon, however, will have to start pumping iron if he expects
to lift the pot of gold he won for winning his sixth race of the
season and 35th overall in a career spanning a remarkably measly 5{
seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Along with a sizeable $637,625 share of the total purse, Gordon
also pocketed the $1 million Winston No Bull 5 bonus.
</P>
<P>
   The top five finishing drivers in the Coca Cola 600 at Charlotte
Motor Speedway on May 24 were eligible to claim the prize. The
trick was, one of them had to win at Indy.
</P>
<P>
   It was Gordon, whose combined $1,637,625 earnings this season is
a motorsports record. He also moved into second place behind Dale
Earnhardt on the all-time list with a cool $20.3 million.
</P>
<P>
   Did we mention that Gordon is only 26? Or is now 72 points ahead
of Martin in the driver's standings and is nearing a third
championship over the past four years?
</P>
<P>
   Didn't think so.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1994, everything went our way,'' said Gordon, referring to
the inaugural race, which he won. ``Everything went our way again
today. I don't know what else to say. I guess when it's meant to
be, it's meant to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Gordon doesn't have to repeat the sentence twice. Martin
understands.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of hard to beat a man when he's got a faster car and
the lead,'' summarized Martin, who finished ahead of third-place
Bobby Labonte, fourth-place Mike Skinner and fifth-place Dale
Earnhardt. ``We threw everything at them that we had. It just
wasn't enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Once the command to start the engines was echoed by NASCAR
Winston Cup President Bill France Jr., Gordon's rainbow-colored
DuPont Automotive Finishes Chevrolet Monte Carlo behaved
beautifully, meaning it roared, not sputtered.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon, who started on the inside of the second row, grabbed the
lead for the first time on Lap 19 and eventually led a whopping 97
of the 160 total laps.
</P>
<P>
   As dominating a performance as it might appear, it truly wasn't
a one-man show.
</P>
<P>
   For starters, pole-sitter Ernie Irvan led the first 18 laps.
</P>
<P>
   Secondly, Dale Jarrett nearly completed an improbable run after
falling four laps down when he ran out of fuel on Lap 81.
</P>
<P>
   A slew of caution flags helped Jarrett fully recover from the
deficit, and when the checkered flag fell, he was back on the lead
lap in 16th position.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Martin became the hunter, sliding by Bobby Labonte on
Lap 144 to move into second.
</P>
<P>
   Even with the aid of three late caution flags over the final 10
laps, Martin still wasn't able to bully his Valvoline Ford Taurus
past Gordon's purring Chevy.
</P>
<P>
   The ninth and final caution flag appeared seconds after Gordon
led the field on a restart on Lap 158, caused by a multicar crash
in front of the main grandstands along the front straightaway.
</P>
<P>
   No one was hurt, and Gordon outmotored Martin around the
2.5-mile oval to maintain the lead.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the debris, which included defending champion Ricky
Rudd's mangled Ford along the inner concrete wall, there wasn't
enough time or laps remaining to create one final green-flag run.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mark made a heck of a run at me going into Turn 2 (on Lap
158),'' Gordon said. ``He knew we were racing back to the caution
and I saw him drive deeper (into Turn 2) than I've seen him do all
weekend long. I could really feel him there.
</P>
<P>
   ``But once he got close to me, his front end washed out on
him.''
</P>
<P>
   And that was that.
</P>
<P>
   Martin reasoned that he might have been able to pester Gordon
over the final three laps had they been green-flag laps, but even
he recognized it likely was a waste of thought.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I might catch him,'' Martin said. ``I thought I was
gaining on him. But I don't know how much he was playing with me.
</P>
<P>
   ``I certainly wasn't going to catch him and pass him unless
something strange happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Nothing strange happened. Nothing at all. &QL;

SAMUELSON'S RACE HEATS UP AT FINISH 
</HEADLINE>
 TO BEACON-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BARBARA HUEBNER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAPE ELIZABETH, Maine _ Part of what made her such a tough
competitor, Joan Benoit Samuelson has often said, were the frozen
eyelashes and icy roads endured during long, blustery Maine winters
of training. So it was a gorgeous irony when her Beach to Beacon
10K was greeted in its first running Saturday by only the bluest of
skies and balmiest of summer days.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maine isn't all bad,'' said the 1984 Olympic marathon gold
medalist with a huge smile, the shimmering Casco Bay as a backdrop
for the 2,337 finishers crossing the line near Portland Head Light.
</P>
<P>
   First across, in 28 minutes 18 seconds, was Johannes Mabitle, a
30-year-old South African, who beat Kenyans William Kiptum and
Peter Ndirangu (both clocked at 28:19) in a thrilling duel to the
tape. The duel was duplicated soon after by the women when
26-year-old Catherine Ndereba of Kenya (32:15) outsprinted Libbie
Hickman of Fort Collins, Colo., (32:17) and countrywoman Helen
Kimaiyo-Kipkoskei (32:18) for the victory.
</P>
<P>
   Americans Steve Plasencia (29:37, an American master's record)
and Kim Jones (34:35) won in the master's division.
</P>
<P>
   Mabitle ran with the lead pack all the way, but by the time it
was whittled to five at the 4-mile mark, most bets were on Mexico's
German Silva to kick for the win. But Silva ended up fourth
(28:23), dropping back just before the push to the finish from
about 150 meters out. At that point Mabitle was still third, but
with 50 meters to go he edged ahead to his first victory in a major
race.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very tough for me,'' he said. ``I was tired. I said,
`Where's the finish line?'''
</P>
<P>
   Ndereba, meanwhile, had no easier task of it. She went out to a
quick lead but was caught by Kimaiyo-Kipkoskei at 2 miles. They
shared it until 6 miles, when Hickman surged ahead of them.
Suddenly, just as with the men, it was a three-way dash.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Helen tried to kick, I just put on my heels,'' said
Ndereba, enjoying a successful comeback season after the May 1997
birth of her daughter, Jane. ``I feel good, because even when I
finished, I was still strong. I could go a further distance.''
</P>
<P>
   There was nothing but praise for the 6.2-mile course, which
began on a sunny flat for about 2 miles before turning onto windy,
shady Shore Road, with ocean vistas reminiscent of the Falmouth
Road Race. ``You could tell a runner put it together,'' praised
Plascencia.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, despite the shoulder-to-shoulder finishes, the sparkling
clear skies, and her frequent protests to the contrary, the day
belonged to Samuelson, who founded this race to give back to her
hometown.
</P>
<P>
   ``Half the people who were out there watching this year, I bet,
will be running next year,'' said an ebullient Samuelson, 41, who
did not compete but did everything else, from wishing the
wheelchair competitors well at the starting line to congratulating
the winners at the finish, with commentary for local TV in between.
``It's literally and physically the people's race _ it's no longer
Joan's race.''

CENTRAL FLORIDA HOPEFUL 
</HEADLINE>
 NOTEBOOK-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK BLAUDSCHUN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ORLANDO, Fla. _ While the Big East fiddles with a new system, a
school in waiting _ Central Florida _ burns with desire to be part
of the family.
</P>
<P>
   This is nothing new. Ever since it made the move to Division 1A
in 1995, Central Florida has been looking for a conference.
</P>
<P>
   The Golden Knights talked to Conference USA, which wasn't
interested, and have courted the Big East for a couple of seasons,
without much of a response.
</P>
<P>
   If you believe some critics of the league, that isn't all that
surprising, since they believe the Big East is near life-support
status.
</P>
<P>
   The fact of the matter is that the Big East _ which should have
one very good team (West Virginia) and a couple of good teams
(Miami and Syracuse) _ needs a jump start. The conference needs new
blood, because the vultures of other conferences are already
checking out teams such as Syracuse, Boston College, and Miami, all
of whom are on wish lists of expansion plans in the Big Ten and
Atlantic 10.
</P>
<P>
   Ask the Big East people about expansion and they shake their
head. ``Don't see it happening,'' says commissioner Mike Tranghese
with a sigh. ``And who would we take?''
</P>
<P>
   Ask Mike Kruczek. ``We'd love to be part of the Big East,'' said
the new Central Florida coach, sitting in his office last week.
``That would be a dream come true for us. Look what we have to
offer.''
</P>
<P>
   Kruczek then began to talk about a university that is now
pushing 30,000 on a sprawling 1,400-acre campus in the heart of the
richest recruiting area in the country.
</P>
<P>
   He talked about plans for a new athletic complex on campus that
will include an expanded weight room, five football practice
fields, new offices, baseball stadium, and tennis complex. It will
be on par with anything in the Southeast, Big East, or any other
major conference.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we first made the move to 1A, this was OK,'' said
Kruczek, who knows about the Big East from his playing days as a BC
quarterback in the mid '70s. ``But I told our people: If you want
to compete with Florida and Florida State, you need the
facilities.''
</P>
<P>
   CFU already has a first-class stadium, as it plays in the
70,000-seat Citrus Bowl, 15 miles away in downtown Orlando. The
school has a commitment to play 1A football, and it draws from a
talent pool in Florida that can field a Top 20 team.
</P>
<P>
   ``But life as an independent is not really possible in 1A,''
said Kruczek, who took over from Gene McDowell last winter on an
interim basis, although Kruczek feels he will get a fair chance to
retain the job. ``We need a conference like the Big East. But
that's out of our hands right now. We just have to do what we can
do and hope for the best.''
</P>
<P>
   Last season, Central Florida did its part by going 5-6 in its
second season in 1A, losing by a point to Ole Miss, 2 to South
Carolina, and giving co-national champion Nebraska all that it
could handle for a half before eventually losing by a pair of
touchdowns in Lincoln.
</P>
<P>
   The effort was a good-news, bad-news experience for CFU.
Athletic director Steve Sloan watched the Golden Knights with a
mixture of pride and pain as he saw his team compete against the
best team in college football, but also understood when a couple of
schools later called and backed out of contracts, fearful of losing
to a ``nobody.''
</P>
<P>
   Central Florida has had its growing pains, the most serious
being the cellular phone calling card scandal last year that
brought in federal authorities and led to the dismissal of
McDowell, who had nurtured CFU from a Division 2 program to a 1A
wannabe with a $2.2 million football budget that is growing
steadily.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's the downside for anyone taking us?'' asked Kruczek, who
has a team that could be bowl-eligible this year, with a
talent-loaded roster led by quarterback Daunte Culpepper, who could
make a serious run at the Heisman Trophy this season and is
projected as a top-five NFL draft pick next spring. ``We play in a
great market, with lots of talent, in a big-time stadium, and the
commitment is firm.''
</P>
<P>
   So it is. The Golden Knights will open their season at Louisiana
Tech Sept. 5 and hope they can make another step toward becoming a
Division 1A power, if not partner in a major conference.
</P>
<P>
   They'd love the Big East to call, but the phone hasn't rung.
They also want the world _ and the Big East _ to know that they
would come as a football-only member.
</P>
<P>
   Why, then, is the Big East doing nothing? Afraid of offending
Miami? Please. A Central Florida-Miami rivalry would probably help
the Hurricanes, and trips to Orlando would help every other Big
East school.
</P>
<P>
   But the call to Sloan or CFU president Dr. John Hitt has not
been made, and the question you have to ask is why.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   We understand the need for some Top 10 teams to play easy games,
but why is Alabama-Birmingham on Nebraska's schedule Sept. 5? ...
Isn't it interesting that the NCAA has taken a strong stance
against gambling but allows athletic directors and conferences to
hold conventions in gambling dens such as Las Vegas? Latest
example: Western Athletic Conference football media day was last
week at the MGM Grand Hotel. The conference will also again hold
its championship game in Vegas ... Nebraska goes into the season
with the longest winning streak in 1A at 14. Michigan is next at
12, followed by UCLA (10) and, surprise, Colorado State (9) ...
Every team in the WAC has at least 10 starters returning, topped by
Nevada-Las Vegas with 20 ... Iowa State has chosen an unusual way
to build its program. The Cyclones have 18 junior college transfers
on their roster ... It was a victory for supporters of big-time
football when a proposal to reduce football scholarships was
rejected by the Division 1 Management Council. A movement to reduce
scholarships from 85 to 75 has been in the works for the past few
years ... The Big East has bowl commitments for three teams _ in
the Alliance, Gator, and Insight.com. A fourth bowl commitment is
still in the works. Tranghese is working on the Liberty Bowl in
Memphis, Music City in Nashville, and the Motor City Bowl in
Pontiac, Mich.

ASU'S PALMORE ITCHING TO PLAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PAOLA BOIVIN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Thanks to Professor Freedman and Professor Richardson, redshirt
freshman Courtney Palmore finds himself in the running to start at
strong safety for Arizona State.
</P>
<P>
   Palmore played student last season and took plenty of mental
notes while watching starting safeties Mitchell Freedman and Damien
Richardson.
</P>
<P>
   ``I learned a lot from them,'' he said. ``They both work really
hard. They both know what they're doing. I kind of looked at them
as another coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both are very smart players, and that's what it takes. It
isn't just about physical ability.''
</P>
<P>
   Palmore hopes to step in for Richardson, who has graduated. It
won't be easy. Richardson was one of the headiest players on the
team and ranked second in unassisted (42) and total tackles (71)
and also posted two interceptions.
</P>
<P>
   Palmore also hopes to be joined by Freedman, the heart of the
secondary. Freedman is finishing summer school, and a source said
he is in good shape to retain his academic eligibility.
</P>
<P>
   A strong spring put Palmore, who said he is 10 pounds heavier
than last season, in the running for the starting job.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know I'm young, but I know my material,'' he said. ``I'm
anxious to get on the field like everyone else.''
</P>
<P>
   Battling Palmore for the job will be Christon Rance, who
substituted for Richardson last season. Rance will try to use Camp
Tontozona to make up for his tough outing in the spring-ending
scrimmage.
</P>
<P>
   There's no chance Freedman will move to strong safety, as was
speculated in the spring.
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes years of experience to play in the middle,''
defensive coordinator Phil Snow said. ``If you look at (Freedman)
two years ago, he had one interception. Last year he had four. He's
starting to understand how to play the whole field, which is what
you have to do in that position.''
</P>
<P>
   Junior cornerback Courtney Jackson returns and will move from
the right to the left side where Jason Simmons played so adeptly
last season. His new partner at cornerback likely will be junior
J'Juan Cherry, a physically gifted player who just needs to
fine-tune his technique and gain game experience. There may be no
player on the team with more potential than Cherry.
</P>
<P>
   The staff also will look at junior Kareem Clark, who appeared in
nickel and dime packages in eight games last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll play a lot of people on defense this year,'' Snow said.
``I bet 18 to 20 every week. There are a lot of young guys that are
close, and it's hard for them to understand what it takes to play
70 to 75 snaps. It takes years to build up to that.''
</P>
<P>
   Can a team rotating so many players on defense emerge as one of
the top teams in the country, as so many are predicting?
</P>
<P>
   ``We try not to focus on what people think about us,'' Palmore
said. ``Of course, we want to win the national championship, we
have the potential to do it. It's up to us to produce.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe we can get it done.'' &QL;

JULICH RIDING HIGH 
</HEADLINE>
 DE FRANCE-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SUSAN BICKELHAUPT  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LE CREUSOT, France _ The Tour de France edged a little closer to
Paris Saturday, and Bobby Julich edged a little closer to the
podium. It might not be in the second-place spot he held two days
ago, but barring a crash that sidelines the rider, Julich, a
26-year-old from Glenwood Springs, Colo., should take the stand
Sunday as third-place finisher.
</P>
<P>
   In front of him will be Italian Marco Pantani as leader and
German defending champion Jan Ullrich, who won Saturday's time
trial.
</P>
<P>
   The course Saturday was determined not to be kind to the riders,
and not just because of the rolling, 32-mile ride in central
France. Rain fell on the first racers who set out one by one, and
even though it subsided into an occasional drizzle, the skies
remained gray and the temperature dipped to 60 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the riders, who set out at two-minute intervals, rode a
blistering pace of an average of 30 m.p.h. as they covered the
course on their bikes with disc wheels and triathlon handlebars.
</P>
<P>
   Tyler Hamilton of Brookline, Mass., had the lead for the first
hour and ended up in a respectable 15th place. He is 51st overall.
</P>
<P>
   When Ullrich started off in the race against the clock, it was
clear that he was determined to swallow the 14-second deficit he
had against Julich. He did, easily beating all others with a time
of 1 hour 3 minutes 52 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Julich came in second, a minute behind Ullrich, and dropped to
third place overall. But he seemed to take it in stride.
</P>
<P>
   ``The time trial is very hard,'' Julich said, smiling but
coughing after the race. ``All I could think of was how hard I
worked to get here.''
</P>
<P>
   So is a place on the podium a dream come true?
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of a dream,'' he said. ``I won't be satisfied until I
really see what my limits are. I'm not sure if I quite found out my
limits in this race. I know there were a lot of things that tried
to get in the way of my dream, and I just know that in the future,
with the support of all my close friends and family, I can get back
here and do even better. But it's so nice to climb the mountain and
look down and see the view a little bit. I'm not quite there;
there's a few more steps.
</P>
<P>
   ``So I won't stop until I either win the Tour de France or I'm
too old to ride my bike.''
</P>
<P>
   Julich's father, Bob, stood nearby beaming.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't going to come here; I knew it would be confusing,''
he said, looking at the swarm of cameras and journalists
surrounding his son. ``But I talked to him on Monday and he was
tired, so I knew I had to come over and give him a little boost.''
</P>
<P>
   So he, his ex-wife, Bernadette, and daughter, Robin, flew over
to catch the end of the Tour. Also following the rider has been
Julich's girlfriend, Angela Morgan.
</P>
<P>
   And it's no wonder where Julich gets his pragmatic attitude.
When his father was asked what he thought about his son's
third-place, not second-place, finish, he just shrugged.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, you work harder when you've got two steps to climb
instead on one,'' he said. ``I'm just so happy. His goal was to be
in the top 10, and this will just make him hungrier.''
</P>
<P>
   Barring a major accident Sunday, all 96 remaining riders should
roll into Paris as a pack, with one rider sprinting to the finish.
</P>
<P>
   No one dares say that anything is for certain in the Tour de
France _ not after Greg LeMond came from almost a minute deficit to
win the race in 1989 on the final day. The difference was that that
was an individual time trial; Sunday's race is a flat road race.
</P>
<P>
   Frankie Andreau of Dearborn, Mich., knows it well. He's been
there six times before, and once missed the winning sprint by less
than a wheel.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a good race for everybody,'' he said of the frenzy that
takes place at the finish on the Champs Elysees. ``There's 30 guys
going for the win, there's 10 or 15 guys worrying about their
overall standing, and there's 80 guys who don't care what happens.
They're just waiting for the bell lap.''
</P>
<P>
   But be assured that after the past three weeks of racing results
mixed with drug news, everyone will be glad when the race is
finally over.

   Definitive word on the academic eligibility of several ASU
players and recruits may not be known until the start of Camp
Tontozona, Sun Devils Coach Bruce Snyder said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until the process is complete and I have the paper work in
front of me, I don't believe anything,'' he said. ``The process
sometimes takes a while.''
</P>
<P>
   Two defensive starters _ safety Mitchell Freedman and linebacker
Larry Johnson _ are enrolled in junior colleges to regain
eligibility.
</P>
<P>
   Snyder also is awaiting paper work on several recruits. Two who
aren't expected to be eligible this season are Mesa Mountain View
offensive lineman Damien Niko and Tucson High offensive lineman
Ralph Zarate. &QL; 
 &QL; 
The White line &QL; 
 &QL; 
ASU Athletics Director Kevin White had no idea what was in store
when he decided recently to do his weekly radio show from Ireland,
where he was vacationing.
</P>
<P>
   As White was wrapping up on KMVP-AM (860), he hung up quickly.
No one was sure why.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, White was calling from a pub and another patron was
upset White was tying up the line. He kept bugging White while he
was on the air and finally threatened to throw some punches.
</P>
<P>
   White wisely hung up. &QL; 
 &QL; 
I need my space &QL; 
 &QL; 
On one of his first days at work, new basketball Coach Rob Evans
pulled into his ASU parking space. Or so he thought.
</P>
<P>
   Little did Evans know it actually belonged to Bruce Snyder, who
spotted an unfamiliar car in ``his'' space and decided to box in
the culprit.
</P>
<P>
   Later in the day, Evans innocently asked another staff member if
the spot he parked in was OK.
</P>
<P>
   ``Uh no,'' he was told. ``That belongs to our football coach.''
</P>
<P>
   A sheepish Evans explained his mistake to Snyder, who apologized
to Evans for boxing him in.
</P>
<P>
   The next day Snyder couldn't resist asking Evans if it was OK if
he took his parking space back. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Caught in the web &QL; 
 &QL; 
Wide receiver Lenzie Jackson was a popular guest recently on
Arizona Central's Web chat area. He fielded more than 70 questions
from fans (even his mom, Joyce Boyd, of Milpitas, Calif., made a
surprise appearance) and addressed ASU's prospects for the upcoming
season.
</P>
<P>
   Among the highlights:
</P>
<P>
   Question: What defensive back gives you the most trouble in
practice?
</P>
<P>
   Answer: None of them. (He laughs.) Probably Courtney Jackson
because he's fast and has really long arms. And he runs his mouth
the entire time.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What's your favorite Tempe hangout?
</P>
<P>
   A: The library. (He laughs again.)
</P>
<P>
   Q: What player will be the biggest surprise this season?
</P>
<P>
   A: (Cornerback) J'Juan Cherry. He has a knack for the ball. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Quick hits &QL; 
 &QL; 
``ESPN Magazine'' recently photographed J.R. Redmond for an
upcoming issue featuring college football's most exciting players.
</P>
<P>
   Vince Amey, one of ASU's starting defensive ends last season,
has been praised in Bay Area newspapers by Oakland Raiders Coach
Jon Gruden. The Raiders took Amey in the seventh round.
</P>
<P>
   Former safety Damien Richardson has been making an impression on
the Carolina Panthers and is projected to make the team and play in
nickel and dime packages. &QL;

GREAT BARRINGTON SET FOR 20-DAY MEET 
</HEADLINE>
 NOTEBOOK-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON INDRISANO  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; BOSTON _ Great Barrington Race Course, having survived a
six-year hiatus and a tornado, conducted a successful 12-day
meeting last year and returns Friday with a 20-date meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Idle since 1991, the fairgrounds was struck by a tornado in 1995
that leveled everything in its wake, including the track's
grandstand. The track was restored at a cost of $3 million and now
even features a Terrace Club, complete with dining tables. ``Last
year, we were overwhelmed by the response of the fans and the
community,'' said Patty Nee, Great Barrington vice president.
``They know we are committed to restoring racing as a tradition in
Western Massachusetts. We are ready to go and excited to offer
eight additional days.''
</P>
<P>
   Great Barrington will race on a four-day schedule of Fridays
through Mondays, running Friday through Aug. 10, Aug. 14-17, and
Aug. 21-24. There will then be a break to allow Northampton Fair,
which has traditionally run on Labor Day, to conduct its 10-date
meeting over 12 days, Aug. 27-Sept. 7. Racing at Great Barrington
will return Sept. 11-14 and Sept. 18-21. Post time on Fridays and
Mondays will be 3 p.m.; post on Saturdays and Sundays will be 1:30.
</P>
<P>
   Sam Abbey, who works at Hialeah, will return as racing
secretary, and Frank Mirahmadi will be back as track announcer.
``We expect more horses than last year and we should be able to
offer the fans competitive races with good fields of well-matched
horses,'' said Abbey, who indicated the track would be open for
training beginning Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Admission will be free on opening day and $2 thereafter. For you
collectors, there will be a T-shirt giveaway Aug. 22.
</P>
<P>

<P>
   The $1 million Haskell Invitational, to be run Aug. 9 at
Monmouth Park, is a handicap, which is unusual for races restricted
to 3-year-olds. Real Quiet, winner of the Kentucky Derby and
Preakness, was assigned high weight of 126 pounds, while Victory
Gallop, the victor in the Belmont Stakes, was given 125. Coronado's
Quest, who is on a three-race winning streak, including the Dwyer
at Belmont July 12, was assigned 124.
</P>
<P>
   Real Quiet worked 6 furlongs in 1:124/5 at Del Mar July 25.
Asked why Real Quiet was held out of the Swaps Stakes at Hollywood,
trainer  &UR; Bob Baffert  &LR; replied: ``He was a little funky in his hind
end, but he's over it. We're starting to lean on him now. He's
great. He's all set for the Haskell.''
</P>
<P>
   Victory Gallop zipped 6 panels in 1:113/5 at Churchill Downs
July 22, the best move at that distance that day. ``He's doing
great,'' said trainer  &UR; Elliott Walden &LR; . ``He started out about 10
lengths behind two other horses and beat them by about 15 lengths.
The next-fastest 6 furlongs work was in 1:15. It was an awful good
work for him.'' After being shipped to Saratoga, Victory Gallop
authored another bullet work, going 5 furlongs in :593/5 Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Coronado's Quest, who worked a half in :484/5 July 21
at Belmont, is ready to go after zipping three-eighths in :371/5 on
the Saratoga training track Tuesday. ``He came out of the Dwyer
good,'' said trainer  &UR; Shug McGaughey &LR; . ``We'll bring him down to
Monmouth the Wednesday before the Haskell and school him in the
paddock one day. We want to get him in there and get him settled.''
</P>
<P>
   Jockey  &UR; Gary Stevens &LR; , &UR;  &LR; who rides first call for Baffert, had an
option but he chose to stay on Victory Gallop for the Haskell,
while  &UR; Kent Desormeaux  &LR; will ride Real Quiet, as he did throughout
the Triple Crown. As of now, there are only four horses committed
to the Haskell, including Arctic Sweep, most recently third in the
Long Branch.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Gentlemen, who ran third to Skip Away in the Hollywood Gold Cup
June 28, is working extremely well toward defending his
championship in the $1 million Pacific Classic Aug. 15. Gentlemen
went 6 furlongs in 1:104/5 at Del Mar July 24, a brilliant move
accomplished under rider  &UR; Corey Nakatani &LR; . ``He went real nice,''
said trainer  &UR; Richard Mandella &LR; . ``He galloped out 7 furlongs in
1:23, and looks like he's in very good shape.'' ... Skip Away, who
will compete next in the $500,000 Iselin Handicap at Monmouth Aug.
30, is also doing well. The big gray, winner of seven in a row,
sizzled 5 furlongs in :591/5 under  &UR; Jerry Bailey  &LR; at Belmont July
26, the best workout of the day. ``He went very easy,'' said
trainer  &UR; Sonny Hine &LR; . ``That was about as slow as Jerry could hold
him. The big thing about the trip to California was fatigue. I
think he's pretty much over all that.'' ...  &UR; Laffit Pincay
 &LR; suffered a broken collarbone and several cracked ribs in a spill
at Del Mar July 25. Pincay's mount in the 10th race, Sid the
Author, was caught in tight quarters heading into the first turn
and fell. The horse was unhurt. Pincay, 51, will be out of action
for as many as seven weeks.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Breeders' Cup has restored the order of races to the
original format and will lead off with the $1 million Juvenile and
the $1 million Juvenile Fillies for the 15th running, Nov. 7 at
Churchill. The two races for 2-year-olds will be followed by the $1
million Sprint, the $1 million Mile on the grass, the Distaff,
which has been raised to a purse of $2 million, the $2 million
Turf, and the $4 million Classic. This was the order when the
Breeders' Cup began in 1984 but, in subsequent years, the Juvenile
Fillies was made the first race, followed by the Sprint, the
Distaff, the Mile, and the Juvenile. Only the Turf and Classic have
remained unchanged. ``With its increased stature and a $2 million
purse, we feel the Distaff should be placed after the $1 million
races have been run,'' said  &UR; D.G. Van Clief &LR; , &UR;  &LR; president of the
Breeders' Cup. ``We also believe that returning 2-year-old races to
the beginning of the program provides a better progression of
events for the day.'' ... Sharp Cat, injured while galloping in a
walkover in the Bayakoa Handicap at Hollywood Dec. 7, made an
impressive 1998 debut by winning Del Mar's version of the Bayakoa
Handicap by more than 5 lengths July 27. Previously trained by  &UR; D.
Wayne Lukas &LR; , &UR;  &LR; Sharp Cat is now in the hands of  &UR; Wally
Dollase &LR; , &UR;  &LR; and she won with speed to spare under Nakatani, running
a mile in 1:35 at odds of 4-5 ($3.60 to win).

OWNERS IN TEXAS OPEN FAT WALLETS  
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PEDRO GOMEZ  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   If it seemed like there were more last-minute trades this year
than in others, it's because there were.
</P>
<P>
   There is still one more trading deadline, Aug. 31, but in order
to make a deal and have a player eligible for your postseason
roster, all the players involved must have cleared waivers, which
is becoming increasingly difficult.
</P>
<P>
   That's the reason for the flurry of trades on Friday. Clubs were
making their last-gasp efforts to bolster themselves while they
could. Of all the trades made, the two clubs that reside in Texas
did the best job. The owners of the Houston Astros (Drayton McLane)
and Texas Rangers (Tom Hicks) displayed that each is willing to dig
deep into his pocket to fortify his club.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros landed the biggest fish when they acquired Randy
Johnson, who last season won 20 games and has a Cy Young Award on
his resume. With Johnson, the Astros now can enter the playoffs
with three solid starters.
</P>
<P>
   Shane Reynolds and Mike Hampton can now drop to No. 2 and 3 in
the rotation, where they probably belong anyway, and let Johnson
take the heat of facing the toughest pitcher on the team the Astros
meet in the first round of the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   It's also the kind of move that probably cements the NL Central
crown for Houston. Only a miracle on Chicago's north side could
push the Cubs past Houston now.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Rangers probably made the kind of move that will
catapult them past Anaheim in the AL West.
</P>
<P>
   Getting Todd Stottlemyre, one of the best big-game pitchers
around these days, as well as shortstop Royce Clayton and third
baseman Todd Zeile strengthens the Rangers and plugs up their most
obvious holes, including having a No. 1 starter for the rest of the
season.
</P>
<P>
   Zeile will provide more punch in the middle of Texas' lineup,
and Clayton will definitely provide an upgrade at shortstop on
defense, where Kevin Elster is not quite the same as he was two
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Another big winner on the last day of the intense trading season
was the New York Yankees, who decided not to mess with their
incredible chemistry and will go the rest of the way with what has
to be considered the best club in the majors.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees analyzed their situation and passed when it came
time to jump into the trading fray. It's the type of decision for
which first-year General Manager Brian Cashman should be applauded,
especially since he seems to have some influence over principal
owner George Steinbrenner.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees could only have lost if they had made a splashy
move. By keeping this clubhouse intact, the message is simple: The
club's front office is impressed enough by what it has seen so far
to let this group go at it the rest of the way.
</P>
<P>
   A big high-five to the Yankees, Astros and Rangers; the big
winners in this season's trading frenzy. &QL; 
 &QL; 
The two NL wild cards? &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   New York Mets Manager Bobby Valentine predicted his ballclub
will claim the wild-card spot. In Los Angeles, interim General
Manager Tommy Lasorda guaranteed the Dodgers would lock up a
playoff spot.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've heard there'll be two wild cards this year,'' San
Francisco Manager Dusty Baker said, tongue in cheek. ``Where does
that leave us and the rest of the teams?''
</P>
<P>
   Said Giants second baseman Jeff Kent, showing off his Berkley
education, ``Did Tommy say something stupid the other day?''
</P>
<P>
   Kent went on to add, ``If we don't make the playoffs, I'll be
eating dinner with Lasorda during the playoffs. I'll even buy the
guy dinner.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
The Kile file &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Darryl Kile just can't get it going in his first season with the
Colorado Rockies, who agreed to shell out $24 million over three
seasons for one of the most dominating pitchers in the game last
season.
</P>
<P>
   Kile enters his 25th start today in Chicago with a disappointing
7-13 record that includes a 5.62 ERA. Kile was the starting pitcher
in the Rockies 12-1 loss to Pittsburgh on Wednesday, a game in
which Kile, who had a deadly curveball last year, allowed nine
runs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I take notice on the bench,'' Rockies manager Don Baylor. ``A
lot of the hits are off his fastball, not his breaking ball. I
don't know if the word is around the league to lay off the
curveball and sit on the fastball, but a lot of guys are sitting on
the fastball and hitting it.''
</P>
<P>
   And Kile's problems have not been limited to his starts at
hitter-friendly Coors Field.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not an excuse,'' Kile said of Coors Field. ``You still
have to pitch. You make good pitches and do things you have to do,
and you will be fine.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
Bobby Bo troubles &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Bonilla and the Los Angeles Dodgers seem to be at odds
about what to do with him for the remainder of the season. It seems
Bonilla wants to go home and rest and the Dodgers want him back in
the lineup, presumably so they can attempt to trade him.
</P>
<P>
   Dodgers interim GM Lasorda would love to trade Bonilla to
anyone. Of course, Bonilla, who is owed $11.8 million the next two
seasons, is not necessarily someone many clubs are clamoring for.
</P>
<P>
   The only reason Florida was able to dump Bonilla was after
packaging him with catcher Charles Johnson and Gary Sheffield as a
take-it-or-leave-it proposition. But Bonilla, on the disabled list
since July 15, insists he cannot play because of his still-healing
left wrist.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way I'm feeling right now, I can't do what I've proven I'm
capable of doing,'' said Bonilla, 35. ``Ideally, I could just go
home now and start to rehab for next season. That way, I could just
let it start to get better, which would be better for both parties.
They knew I had surgery in December, and they knew what they were
getting when they traded for me.''
</P>
<P>
   All of which came as news to Lasorda.
</P>
<P>
   ``He hasn't said anything to me,'' Lasorda said. ``If Bobby Bo
tells me his arm is bothering him, you think I'm going to ask him
to play? I watched him take batting practice, and he was hitting
them into the upper deck (in Philadelphia). He seemed like he was
swinging the bat real well to me.'' &QL;

GILKEY JUMPS RIGHT INTO AC TION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DON KETCHUM  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MILWAUKEE _ It certainly wasn't the most productive game of
Bernard Gilkey's career, but he'll take it, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Gilkey, acquired in a trade with the New York Mets on Friday,
arrived here Saturday afternoon in time to put on his Diamondbacks
uniform (he tried several pairs of pants before finding comfortable
ones) and start in left field.
</P>
<P>
   He was hitless in four at-bats, grounding into a double play and
striking out. The strikeout pitch turned out to be a passed ball in
the eighth inning as Danny Klassen scored what proved to be the
winning run and Gilkey reached first in Arizona's 5-4 victory at
Milwaukee County Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Gilkey did manage to come up with a big defensive play, moving
in quickly and making a diving catch of a soft liner by Marquis
Grissom to lead off the fourth inning.
</P>
<P>
   Of his busy day, Gilkey said, ``I didn't want to wait (to play).
I wanted to get back into the flow as quickly as possible. I just
couldn't get that string going (offensively) with the Mets. I
figure I'll get some playing time here.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether Gilkey remains in left field will play itself out in the
coming days. If he does stay there, it likely would cut playing
time for rookie David Dellucci, who has started most of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Dellucci could move to right, as he did Saturday night, but
Karim Garcia and Yamil Benitez also figure into the mix. Gilkey
also could move to right, leaving Dellucci in left. &QL;  &QL; 
A new life &QL;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Klassen always thought he'd eventually play for the Brewers at
County Stadium or the new Miller Park, but all of that ended when
the team left him unprotected in the expansion draft and he was
chosen by the Diamondbacks.
</P>
<P>
   The Brewers liked Klassen, even though he was error-prone as a
shortstop at Double-A El Paso in 1997 and never reached Triple-A.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would have liked to have come here, but they made their
decision and I'm happy where I am,'' said Klassen, who since has
moved to second base and hit a booming RBI triple on Friday night
in the first of the three-game weekend series. &QL;  &QL; 
Short stops &QL;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Another Diamondbacks player with Brewers or Wisconsin ties is
catcher Damian Miller, who grew up near LaCrosse, in the western
part of the state along the Mississippi River. Miller had family
members in attendance on Friday night and a busload of people from
the area showed up Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Third baseman Matt Williams played another game with Triple-A
Tucson on Saturday night as part of his rehabilitation assignment.
He likely will be activated from the disabled list on Monday in
time for the first of a three-game series with the Cubs at Wrigley
Field.
</P>
<P>
   A trade on Thursday by the Diamondbacks slipped through the
cracks: journeyman infielder-outfielder Hensley Meulens was sent to
the Chicago White Sox for a player to be named later. Meulens was
playing for Tucson, but had been with the big club briefly. &QL;  &QL;

SEIGLER STEALS SHOW WITH 2 INTERCEPTIONS 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   FLAGSTAFF _ At 5 feet 9 and 178 pounds, Dexter Seigler was the
biggest man on the field Saturday in the Cardinals intrasquad
scrimmage.
</P>
<P>
   But who is Dexter Seigler?
</P>
<P>
   Fans who've frequented workouts during training camp already
knew that the newcomer to the secondary has a knack for making
plays. He's been no stranger to picking off passes in daily
two-a-day drills.
</P>
<P>
   In Saturday's controlled scrimmage, the coaches' first look at
the team in live action, Seigler twice picked off second-string
quarterback Stoney Case, taking the first interception back 60
yards for the only touchdown of the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   After Case moved the second offense into scoring range on the
next drive, Seigler intercepted him at the 4 and ran it back 35
yards. His 95 yards on the two returns covered nearly as much
ground as the first and second offenses combined in a session
dominated by the defense.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals rushed for only 48 yards (a 2.8-yard average),
including 12 yards in five tries by Adrian Murrell, the new starter
at running back. Quarterback Jake Plummer was the victim of shaky
protection and completed 3 of 5 passes for 20 yards in the face of
a strong rush.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm still kind of learning the defense,'' Seigler said. ``I
still have some rough edges that I have to fine tune.''
</P>
<P>
   For Seigler, who signed in June as a free agent, this might be
his last chance to make it. He has kicked around, from Toronto of
the Canadian Football League to three seasons with the Seattle
Seahawks to Amsterdam of NFL Europe this past spring. His three
interceptions led a league-leading defense and earned Seigler NFL
Europe Comeback player honor.
</P>
<P>
   With injuries to cornerbacks Tom Knight (shoulder), J.J.
McCleskey (thigh), and Ty Howard (hamstring), Seigler got his
chance Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know much about him before we signed him, but he made
the most of an opportunity, and that's what you look for,''
Cardinals Coach Vince Tobin said. ``He certainly covered those two
throws well. The rest, I don't know about.''
</P>
<P>
   Seigler acknowledged that he goofed on another play, a quick
pass from Case to Fred Brock. Seigler went for the interception,
missed, and Brock went 23 yards after making the catch.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that Dexter's been in the league a couple of years,
he's not in awe,'' said Larry Marmie, coach of the Cardinals
secondary. ``He's got some experience. Now he's getting a feel for
our system.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a lot of small cornerbacks here, although it's not
necessarily by design. Sometimes the bigger guys don't move their
feet and change direction as well. We play a fair amount of
man-to-man, so we're looking for guys who can move and stay with a
wide-out.''
</P>
<P>
   Injuries kept 14 players from dressing for the scrimmage, which
was attended by an estimated 7,000 at Walkup Skydome.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the first offense, which was nearly intact, could not move
against the decimated first defense, getting only a 24-yard field
goal from Joe Nedney in three series.
</P>
<P>
   Quarterback Dave Brown completed 5 of 7 passes for 31 yards with
the third offense. &QL;

RICE SAYS HE'S BREATHING EASIER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   FLAGSTAFF _ Cardinals defensive end Simeon Rice felt so much
better Saturday, he asked team doctor Wayne Kuhl if he could
participate in the scrimmage.
</P>
<P>
   Kuhl, treating Rice for asthmatic bronchitis, turned down Rice's
request, but not before pronouncing him ``90 percent improved.''
</P>
<P>
   Rice, who has been out since Wednesday, said he would be back at
practice Monday morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to get out there today,'' Rice said after the
scrimmage. ``I don't want to waste time (watching). For the most
part, I was having a real good camp. I'm regaining my weight. I'm
getting my breath back. But since I've been young I've had a
(breathing) problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Denying a rift &QL;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Rice said he was aware of a Phoenix radio report that defensive
tackle Eric Swann walked out of Friday morning's workout because he
was upset that Rice didn't practice.
</P>
<P>
   Rice said there was no problem between him and Swann, who had
words with Coach Vince Tobin before storming out of practice in
street clothes.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's cool,'' Rice said of Swann. ``We've always been cool.
It's official with me. I don't sense there is anything (wrong).'' &QL;  &QL; 
Knight examined &QL;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Team orthopedist Russell Chick examined starting cornerback
Tommy Knight's sprained left shoulder Saturday and thinks it is
healing.
</P>
<P>
   But he still wants Knight to have a magnetic resonance imaging
examination Monday in the Valley to make sure he did not damage any
ligaments.
</P>
<P>
   Chick said if it's just a slight sprain, Knight will
rehabilitate the injury for a few days and then be listed as
day-to-day. But he said that significant ligament damage to the
shoulder could put Knight out for the year. &QL;  &QL; 
Gutsy performance &QL;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The long catch of the scrimmage was a 23-yarder by wide receiver
Fred Brock, who continues to play despite suffering fractured
finger in his left hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``(The doctor) wanted to put a pin in, but he wouldn't let
him,'' receivers coach Vic Rapp said. ``He knows he's got a chance
to make this team and won't come out of there.''
</P>
<P>
   Brock said the finger is painful, especially when he is
blocking, but that a pin would ``keep me out too long.'' &QL;  &QL; 
Short shots &QL;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Second-year outside linebacker Tony McCombs, bidding for a
starting job, led the team with six tackles.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Player was impressive on both of his punts, averaging 46.5
yards. Rookie Marcus Williams, the Arizona State and Tempe
McClintock High School product, had one punt for 38 yards. &QL;

PLUMMER'S PLUMP PAYDAY WILL COME AT END OF SEASON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE SCHOENFELD  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Cardinals quarterback Jake Plummer is about six months away from
hitting the jackpot.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals will tear up the third year of his $1.6 million
rookie contract and make him the wealthiest starting quarterback in
their 100-year history.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're completely confident that when the time comes, the
Cardinals will take care of Jake Plummer,'' said his agent, Leigh
Steinberg.
</P>
<P>
   Taking care of Plummer probably means paying him $5 million a
year, as long as he has the type of season the Cardinals are
expecting.
</P>
<P>
   Rob Johnson, in his first year in Buffalo, recently signed a
five-year, $25 million deal that included a team-record $8.5
million signing bonus.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan Leaf, the second pick overall, signed a six-year deal with
San Diego last week that could pay him as much as $31 million, or
$5 million a year.
</P>
<P>
   Both Johnson and Leaf are Steinberg clients.
</P>
<P>
   ``The new salary of $5 million a season is going to be the going
rate for (starting) quarterbacks without a lot of experience,''
Steinberg said.
</P>
<P>
   Peyton Manning, the top pick overall, got more. He signed a
six-year deal with Indianpolis on Wednesday that was reported as
$48 million, but, in reality, is worth $38 million, or $6.3 million
a year. He'll have to hit a bunch of incentives that are going to
be hard to earn to get the total deal to $48 million.
</P>
<P>
   At a salary of $302,000 this season, Plummer is grossly
underpaid for a starting quarterback. But he is only in his second
year _ his first as a full-time starter _ and still is on his
original contract.
</P>
<P>
   He's not complaining about his salary. In fact, he said he isn't
thinking about it. But he paid close attention to the deals Leaf
and Manning signed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have no interest in raising the issue this year,''
Steinberg said. ``Jake is concentrating on playing and only
playing.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals have known for some time they will have to pay
Plummer the going rate. They have gotten by cheaply at that
position for most of this decade.
</P>
<P>
   Last year's starter, Kent Graham, made $650,000. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Surprise guest &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If Bill Walsh is chosen to replace Carmen Policy as president of
the 49ers, as expected, one of his first decisions could be what to
do about second-year quarterback Jim Druckenmiller.
</P>
<P>
   The 49ers chose Druckenmiller over Plummer in the first round of
the 1997 draft over Walsh's objections.
</P>
<P>
   Druckenmiller has struggled again this summer at training camp,
showing little touch or ability to grasp the team's complicated
``West Coast'' offense.
</P>
<P>
   (He's the same guy who missed the team charter to New Orleans
last year when he went to the international terminal). The biggest
stir he created with the team this summer was when his girlfriend,
Julie Cialini, the 1995 Playboy Playmate of the Year, showed up on
the sidelines at training camp in short-shorts.
</P>
<P>
   Walsh and George Seifert, the 49ers' last two coaches, wouldn't
have been impressed.
</P>
<P>
   ``She wouldn't even be in town if they were coaching,'' a 49ers
official said.
</P>
<P>
   Background check &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Another former Playboy Playmate, Holly Hart, Miss April, is the
new girlfriend of Cincinnati Bengals wide receiver James Hundon.
</P>
<P>
   Hundon was introduced to Hart by a mutual friend in May.
</P>
<P>
   On their first date, Hart asked him if he knew who she was. He
didn't, so Hart showed him some pictures.
</P>
<P>
   ``I almost crashed (the car),'' he said. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Pain in the back &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Former Cardinals middle linebacker Eric Hill has been bothered
by a bad back for most of the St. Louis Rams' training camp.
</P>
<P>
   He first suffered the injury lifting weights in June.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think rest is probably the only solution,'' Hill said.
``We've taken all kinds of tests but haven't found anything
wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Rams Coach Dick Vermeil is not happy that several times during
camp, Hill has practiced in the morning but sat out the afternoon
session.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't bring him here to watch,'' said Vermeil, who signed
Hill to a two-year, $5.25 million deal in the off-season.
</P>
<P>
   Name that team &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Here are two of the names that won't be picked when the
Tennessee Oilers get a new nickname next season: the (Tennes) See
to Shining Sea and the Tennessee Tuxedoes.
</P>
<P>
   Some real possibilities are the Tennessee Smokies (after the
Smokey Mountains), the Tennessee Authority (after the Tennessee
Valley Authority), the Tennessee Rebels, the Tennessee Twisters,
the Tennessee Tornadoes and the Tennessee Thunder.
</P>
<P>
   Short shots &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Oakland Raiders dumped defensive end Shannon Clavelle 20
hours after they signed him last Saturday. They didn't realize he
had been arrested in Stillwater, Okla., earlier in the week on
charges of being a prowler. When he was booked, Stillwater police
discovered he was a fugitive from justice in Colorado and one in
Missouri on various charges ranging from felony fraud to writing
bad checks.
</P>
<P>
   During the past two seasons, Rams quarterback Tony Banks has
been sacked 91 times, more than any NFL quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   Green Bay Packers officials are running out of patience with gay
basher Reggie White, their All-Pro defensive lineman. Team
President Bob Harlan apologized to a national gay and lesbian
political group last week. General Manager Ron Wolf said, ``I
believe everyone is entitled to their opinion, but sometimes it's
time to shut your mouth.''

IT'S NO JOKE, JARRETT RUNS OUT OF GAS  
 CREW'S `GREEDY' CHOICE COSTS EARLY LEADER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK ARMIJO  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ An unhappy Dale Jarrett hurriedly vacated
Indianapolis Motor Speedway on Saturday after a discouraging finish
in the Brickyard 400.
</P>
<P>
   Jarrett had little to say and even less time to say it. Home
beckoned, and it's a long way to North Carolina from a discouraging
16th-place finish.
</P>
<P>
   ``I ran out of gas,'' Jarrett said. ``I had a great race car.
That's all I've got to say. What else do you want to know? I drive
the race car. I come in when they tell me. That's all I do.''
</P>
<P>
   End of story. Adios, Dale.
</P>
<P>
   Too bad, because for a time, it was Jarrett, not winner Jeff
Gordon, who appeared to be the driver to beat.
</P>
<P>
   Jarrett was strong early, grabbing the lead for the first and
only time on Lap 54, zipping by a startled Gordon.
</P>
<P>
   Jarrett proceeded to lead the next 27 laps, but in the team's
attempt to hold the lead at the Lap 80 midway point, the
disgruntled driver ran out of fuel between Turns 1 and 2 on Lap 81.
</P>
<P>
   Jarrett managed to coast to pit road, coming to a stop near the
entrance. But he was a long way from his stall, and by the time his
crew could retrieve him, he lost four precious laps to the leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Several caution flags allowed Jarrett to regain the lost laps as
he continually outran Gordon on restarts.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, after a caution flag on Lap 118, Jarrett was back on
the lead lap, 33 positions behind Gordon. Although Jarrett made up
18 laps, it was a case of too little, too late.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stupid,'' said Steve Allen, a member of Jarrett's crew. ``We
figured we'd go to Lap 79, then tried to get the halfway money
($10,000) for leading. We tried to get a little greedy. But we felt
confident we could do it or we wouldn't have tried.''
</P>
<P>
   Team owner Robert Yates, whose other driver, rookie Kenny Irwin
Jr., crashed while running fourth on Lap 117, wasn't blaming anyone
for the apparent miscalculation.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've (the team) won a lot of races and I'm sure they're
kicking themselves a hell of a lot more than I'm going to kick them
Monday morning,'' Yates said. ``I'm not going to kick them at all.
I'm going to pat them on the back and try to see what they need for
next time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gordon has been so strong, but we know we can beat him.''
</P>
<P>
   Gordon has finishes of fifth or better in 10 of the past 11
races, including four wins. But he admitted the script might have
had a different closing chapter had Jarrett not fallen so far
behind.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was so hard to pass anybody,'' Gordon said. ``Dale Jarrett
was the only car I really saw that could pass anybody that was
close to his own speed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time I came up on somebody, I either had to be faster
than them or I'd get stuck behind them.'' &QL;

KITNA RALLIES SEAHAWKS PAST DALLAS IN PRESEASON OPENER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CLARE FARNSWORTH  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ The Seahawks' present didn't look all that sharp
in Friday night's preseason opener. But a big part of their past
and several pieces of their future did.
</P>
<P>
   After the No. 1 offense struggled in its brief appearance,
backup quarterback Jon Kitna came on to lead the Seahawks to a
touchdown and two field goals and rookie running back Ahman Green
scored the other TD as Seattle outlasted the Dallas Cowboys 20-19
on a hot, muggy evening at Texas Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The efforts of Kitna and Green were needed to offset a two-TD
performance by Chris Warren, the Seahawks' all-time leading rusher
who signed with the Cowboys after being released by Seattle in
March.
</P>
<P>
   Among the 59,357 in attendance was Warren Moon, the Seahawks
starting quarterback who is holding out. Moon, who traveled to the
game from his offseason home in Houston, talked to teammates and
coach Dennis Erickson after the game, and later said that despite
his appearance nothing has changed in the impasse between him and
the club to renegotiate his contract.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a typical preseason opener,'' said Erickson, who has
won three of four as Seahawks coach. ``There were some good things
for both teams.''

JOHNSON TRADE IS STRIKE THREE ON SAD DAY FOR MARINERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ART THIEL  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ The night had the lose-lose-lose feel of those Mariner
seasons of the '80s at the Kingdome _ only lots more people and no
Steve Trout.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Friday, the Mariners lost the longest game in Kingdome
history, a 9-8 series-sweeping, soul-crusher to the Cleveland
Indians. They left 20 men on base over 17 innings. Two more and
they could played the Seahawks here next weekend.
</P>
<P>
   In the evening, they had to face the New York Yankees, a team so
powerful they have applied for a seat on United Nations Security
Council.
</P>
<P>
   But most significantly, they had a lose-lose situation with
Randy Johnson and the trading deadline. As the excruciating hours
dwindled down, the silence that enveloped the franchise seemed to
signal that the club had no shot at doing anything that would be
perceived as a win.
</P>
<P>
   They weren't going to get full value for one of the most
dominating pitchers in the game. And if he were not traded,
management would perpetuate the stink that has hung over this club
since Opening Day, as well as create the impression the aroma will
continue once Johnson leaves as a free agent after the season with
nothing in return.
</P>
<P>
   So after nine months of holding Johnson, the club and its fans
hostage to its aimlessness, management finally ended the saga _ but
not the controversy.
</P>
<P>
   They traded the biggest Unit to the Houston Astros for two
diminutive units _ a minor league pitcher and a minor league
infielder, each of whom are known primarily by their mothers, a few
scouts and a couple of Houston barbecue joints.
</P>
<P>
   Also included is a player to be named. If it is Jeff Bagwell,
management is off the hook. Since it won't be, the Mariners have
kissed off the 1998 season.
</P>
<P>
   While hardly an unusual move in baseball, the abandonment of the
race at the trading deadline is the first here since people started
caring about the team. For those new to the ritual, it requires:
</P>
<P>
   1) overripe vegetable matter;
</P>
<P>
   2) an arm better than the pitcher who will replace Johnson;
</P>
<P>
   3) grocery-sack headgear;
</P>
<P>
   4) new-found passion for Seahawk exhibition games.
</P>
<P>
   Not since Tim Floyd showed up to coach the Chicago Bulls has
there been a sporting constituency left with such a flim-flammed
feeling.
</P>
<P>
   A week full of rumors of veteran, immediate help fueled
expectations that the Mariners will come out of this self-made
ordeal almost whole, particularly since the Yankees were indeed
ready to deal Hideki Irabu.
</P>
<P>
   But the Mariner price _ Irabu and third-base prospect Mike
Lowell _ proved too steep even for the loaded Yankees, because
there was no guarantee Johnson would sign with them after the
season. They bailed out early in the evening, as did apparently
every other team offering major leaguers.
</P>
<P>
   So in the short term, the Mariners ended up with the worst of
all possible arrangements _ no Johnson and no immediate help.
</P>
<P>
   The desperation of July was a direct descendant of last winter's
decision to stand pat. The flawed decision was a surprising tactic,
given that they had won just one playoff game in the previous two
seasons.
</P>
<P>
   The longer term is, of course, unknowable. Management is
counting on the good grace of its fan base to wait on 21-year-old
Freddy Garcia and 22-year-old Carlos Guillen. But the credibility
was already strained in the first moments when the club's press
release identified the players as ``Freddy Garcia and Carlos
Garcia.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the player to be named is another Garcia _ Jerry. At
least he used to play a little third bass.
</P>
<P>
   The good grace of its fan base was already stretched thin,
because knowledgable fans understand that Garcia and Guillen are
replacing prospects from earlier seasons squandered on trades for
veterans in failed attempts to reach the World Series.
</P>
<P>
   Mariner manager Lou Piniella admitted as much.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure we tried to get players who fit here immediately,''
he said. ``Obviously it didn't work out. We gave up young prospects
to enhance our situation before. Houston is doing the same thing
right now.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully, they'll fill up our basket.''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately for Mariner fans, hope is for spring. The July
trading deadline is for pennant races for teams with $53 million
payrolls full of veteran All-Stars who have expensive seats in a
new stadium to sell.
</P>
<P>
   ``This,'' said disgusted first baseman David Segui, ``just makes
our job a lot more difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though Segui couldn't much stand Johnson, he knew the
brooding giant was important for any late-season rally. But now
he's gone and unreplaced. The void will scream until the end of the
season, and probably beyond _ until the Big Unit quits recording
double-digit K's.
</P>
<P>
   The Kingdome scoreboard periodically replays big moments from
the crackling 1995 season, making Friday night's developments all
the more poignant. The one moment that will never be replayed
remains the most vivid in at least one memory.
</P>
<P>
   In the ninth inning of the final game of the Division Series
against the Yankees, the Mariners called upon Johnson to pitch in
relief. His languid stroll in from the bullpen as 60,000 fans stood
screaming and the Yanks sat squirming remains the ultimate
gunslinger moment in baseball.
</P>
<P>
   He went three innings and won the game, the Mariners won the
series as well as the hearts of millions of fans, not to mention a
new ballpark.
</P>
<P>
   The Big Unit took another long walk Friday, once again changing
Seattle baseball forever.

JOHNSON TRADE LEGACY: HOUSTON, WE HAVE A RIPOFF 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LAURA VECSEY  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ He pitched the Mariners' first no-hitter. Then he won
a Cy Young Award. He pitched 19-strikeout games. Two of them last
season.
</P>
<P>
   And, most important, he pitched the Mariners into the postseason
for the first time in their history.
</P>
<P>
   On Randy Johnson's shoulders, 18 years of Mariner futility were
all but washed away.
</P>
<P>
   That is why, on the night the greatest pitcher the Mariners have
ever had was discarded like some used part, it feels a lot like all
those seasons before 1995: a major letdown.
</P>
<P>
   This is not a bright spot in Mariner history.
</P>
<P>
   Randy Johnson deserved better. At least he deserved a better
ending in Seattle _ a city he helped turn into a baseball town.
</P>
<P>
   And when that new ballpark opens next July, the absence of
Johnson on the mound will be all the more painful.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson was traded Friday night to the Astros for two minor
leaguers and a player to be named later. Fine, let's hope the kids
turn out to be good.
</P>
<P>
   But to trade away a star, a commodity, a unique talent like
Johnson, the Mariners should have played the public relations game
better.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson deserved better than what he got. So did Mariner fans.
</P>
<P>
   Mariner ownership must now be shamed for perpetrating one of a
most flawed and embarrassing moves of a front-line, big-time star
player ever.
</P>
<P>
   They said it was bad when Tom Seaver was traded out of New York,
that Seaver cried in the clubhouse, trying to read a farewell
statement to Mets fans.
</P>
<P>
   It was bad in Boston when Roger Clemens' last season was filled
with bitterness, and worse for Red Sox fans the next season when
Clemens won the Cy Young Award with Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   The baseball road is littered with franchise pitchers who were
turned loose. Everyone knows the baseball business is harsh, mostly
because it is a business.
</P>
<P>
   But somehow, this one is worse, because the Mariners squandered
Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   The legacy of this too-little, too-late deal will be all about
what the Mariners did not get for Johnson. No matter how much spin
the Mariners put on these two young Astro prospects, Freddy Garcia
and Carlos Guillen, remember that the Mariners could have gotten
more.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson spent the last eight months agonizing over why the
Mariners did not offer him a contract extension. He felt he
deserved at least an offer.
</P>
<P>
   But from the moment last November they said Johnson would not
finish his career here, the Mariners botched this thing.
</P>
<P>
   And then they made it worse, time and time again.
</P>
<P>
   No deals in winter. No deals in spring. No deal in May, when the
Dodgers were ready to send starting pitcher Ismael Valdes and
infielder Wilton Guerrero as payment.
</P>
<P>
   Never forget that, Mariner fans. The stunned players in the
clubhouse after Friday's game sure looked as if they would not
forget. Not Alex Rodriguez, who knew that last winter, the Yankees
offered David Wells and Mariano Rivera to the M's for Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   We would like to believe it never should have come to this, but
in reality, the moment that the Mariners and Johnson would part
company was predictable.
</P>
<P>
   That is why the Mariners should have crafted a better strategy.
They should have been clearer, stronger in finishing off the
business of getting value for one of the game's best pitchers.
</P>
<P>
   Last August, the day after four-time Cy Young Award-winner Greg
Maddux signed his contract extension with Atlanta, Johnson sat in
the Mariner clubhouse and talked.
</P>
<P>
   The subject was his future.
</P>
<P>
   When asked about Maddux's new deal, Johnson said the $11.5
million-a-year contract was great for Maddux. And then Johnson
smiled slyly, knowing that $11.5 million suddenly represented a new
benchmark, possibly for himself, too.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever took place between Mariner president Chuck Armstrong
and Johnson's agent, we may never know. The Mariners said Johnson's
agent wanted too much money. They made a decision they would not
pay.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Mariner fans would have accepted that. Maybe they would
have understood the economics of that. But by their long, drawn-out
indecision, the Mariners were responsible for Randy Johnson's last
days here being so unbearable _ for him, for his club, for the
fans. Now there is nothing but emptiness and regret to be felt over
the loss of the best pitcher the Mariners ever had.

   &UR; MEN GIVING MONEY, WOMEN YELLING: INTERSECTING STORIES &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Alice Mattison. Quill/Morrow, $13.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the New Haven, Conn., teachers, lawyers and social
workers who populate these whimsical tales are domestic but hardly
domesticated, as they squirm in the intellectual and social shadow
cast by Yale. ``Mattison is a charmer,'' Dwight Garner said last
year in the Book Review. ``It's a joy to tune into her characters'
thoughts.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE WOMEN &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Hilton Als. Noonday/Farrar, Straus &AMP; Giroux, $11.
</P>
<P>
   Three quirky, highly personal portraits explore the themes of
racial and sexual identity by mixing memoir, literary criticism and
reflections on politics and psychology. The subjects are the
author's spirited mother, who moved to Brooklyn from Barbados;
Dorothy Dean, a brilliant but self-destructive fixture in New
York's gay scene in the '60s and '70s; and the Harlem poet and
dramatist Owen Dodson, who was Hilton Als's mentor and lover. In
1997 our reviewer, Andrea Lee, admired the ``almost magical
cohesiveness'' of these ``truly original'' essays, calling this ``a
book to read several times, noting how its application grows
broader and broader upon consideration.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE GOOD BROTHER &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Chris Offutt. Scribner, $12.
</P>
<P>
   After his brother is killed, Virgil Caudill tries to escape a
blood feud in his Kentucky hill town by fleeing to Montana, but he
can't shake the past or the psychological pull of his homeland.
Last year in these pages, Jo Ann Kiser called this ``a fine first
novel by a fierce writer.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; T. REX AND THE CRATER OF DOOM &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Walter Alvarez. Vintage, $13.
</P>
<P>
   A geologist describes how the discovery of a giant
65-million-year-old crater in Yucatan helped advance the once
scandalous theory that a comet or asteroid killed off the dinosaurs
(and nine-tenths of the planet's species at the time). Last year
our reviewer, Timothy Ferris, called this a ``deft and readable ...
account from the world's leading authority on death from above.''
In  &UR; DINOSAUR LIVES: UNEARTHING AN EVOLUTIONARY SAGA &LR; , by John R.
Horner and Edwin Dobb (Harvest/Harcourt Brace, $13), a leading
paleontologist and bone collector explains his craft and uses the
fossil record to offer fascinating ideas about how dinosaurs lived
and evolved. ``We can't all study dinosaurs, but books like this
mean we can all enjoy the process and the results,'' Philip
Gingerich wrote here in 1997. Back in the Holocene, the creatures
described in  &UR; THE MODERN ARK. THE STORY OF ZOOS: PAST, PRESENT AND
FUTURE &LR; , by Vicki Croke (Bard/Avon, $12), benefit from the author's
close-up observation of their lives in captivity. Combining history
with vivid accounts of maulings, this is an ``absorbing,
provocative book,'' Carol Peace Robins said here last year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE CORNERSTONE &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Zoe Oldenbourg. Translated by Edward Hyams. Carroll &AMP; Graf,
$14.95.
</P>
<P>
   The title of this somber historical novel, which has just been
restored to print, refers to Christianity in 13th-century France
and the struggle among the members of a landowning family in
Champagne to build spiritual values in the squalid, bloody age of
chivalry. The result, Elizabeth Janeway said here in 1955, is ``a
vital book, and a rich one'' by an author of ''very substantial
talent.'' Three hundred years later in the New World, the events of
 &UR; AZTEC AUTUMN &LR; , by Gary Jennings (Tor/ Tom Doherty, $6.99), unfold
during another brutal time, in the years after the invasion of
Mexico by the conquistadors. The hero is a young Aztec who plots
revenge after witnessing the death of his father at the hands of
the Spaniards. ``Jennings's fascinating if often gory novel is
guided by exhaustive research,'' Charles Salzberg said here last
year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; WOE IS I: THE GRAMMARPHOBE'S GUIDE TO BETTER ENGLISH IN PLAIN
ENGLISH &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Patricia T. O'Conner. Riverhead, $11.
</P>
<P>
   With chapter titles like ``Death Sentence: Do Cliches Deserve to
Die?'' and ``Comma Sutra: The Joy of Punctuation,'' it's fair to
assume that this grammar book, written by a former editor at The
New York Times Book Review, is irreverent and reader-friendly. But
it's also surprisingly useful. In 1996 our reviewer, Daniel
Pinkwater, called the guide ``lighthearted and funny.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; GERONIMO REX &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Barry Hannah. Grove, $12.
</P>
<P>
   The author's audacious first novel follows the larger-than-life
comic exploits of Harriman Monroe as he romps through the South in
the 1950s and '60s. When it was first published in 1972, our
reviewer, Jim Harrison, called this ``a stunning piece of
entertainment.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; HUNGRY GHOSTS: MAO'S SECRET FAMINE &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Jasper Becker. Owl/Holt, $14.95.
</P>
<P>
   A journalist re-creates in chilling detail the 1959-61 famine
that killed up to 30 million Chinese, a calamity caused by the
obstinacy of the nation's ruthless, ideologically driven leaders.
The book, with a new afterword on the current famine in North
Korea, is ``powerful and important,'' Nicholas Eberstadt wrote here
in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; EXILES: THREE SHORT NOVELS &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Philip Caputo. Vintage Contemporaries, $13.
</P>
<P>
   Whether in Micronesia, suburban Connecticut or Vietnam, the
misfit heroes in this collection are outsiders whose defects lead
them into trouble. Last year in these pages, David Haward Bain said
two of three stories displayed the author's ``extraordinary eye for
the exotica of locale and behavior.''

property. The church is 158 years old abd was founded in 1840 by
blacks who left a white church. They raised the money to buy the

   SOUTHERN-COMMAND _ MIAMI _ As a boy growing up 9 degrees north
of the equator, in the middle of an isthmus that holds the Panama
Canal Zone, young Vicente Ogilvie (CQ) fell under the spell of the
U.S. military. From their cliffside post, soldiers commanded most
of his hemisphere; on weekends they filled the shops and
restaurants of his town. Thirty-seven years later, Ogilvie, now an
Army colonel, serves on a far different post. A Miami business park
has become the new headquarters of the former Panamanian Southern
Command. Hi-tech equipment worth $54 million and protected by
anti-terrorist windows provides the eyes and ears to 32 countries
inhabiting a 12 million-square-mile territory where the command
governs military operations. (Staletovich, Palm Beach Post). 32.

   GUGGENHEIM-HOGS (New York) _ ``The Art of the Motorcycle'' is an
exhibition quite different from anything else that Museum Mile on
Fifth Avenue has ever experienced. Bathed in biker glory, it has
become the most highly attended exhibition in the Guggenheim's
61-year history, far outstripping retrospectives of Roy
Lichtenstein and Ellsworth Kelly, and more popular than
authoritative surveys of Chinese, Russian and Italian art. By Carol

<P>
   VANGOGH-FAKES (Undated) _ For more than a year, art historians
have been arguing over the authenticity of ``Sunflowers,'' and,
less vehemently, over dozens of other van Gogh paintings. Now,
although an article published in March has quelled, but not
completely dispelled, the questions about ``Sunflowers,'' the issue
of the authenticity of many van Gogh works is moving into a new
stage, out of scholarly journals and into the public arena. Some
museums have taken questioned paintings down from their walls for
further study, while others are organizing exhibitions around the
controversy or counting on it to add sizzle to shows with a broader
rationale. By Judith H. Dobrzynski.

   JEWS-PHILANTHROPY (Undated) _ Once the envy of fundraisers of
all faiths, the United Jewish Appeal and the Council of Jewish
Federations were the unrivaled powerhouses of Jewish philanthropy.
But just as Jews have become sharply divided over the most basic
questions of Jewish identity, these groups _ which still raise well
over $1 billion each year _ are struggling to persuade a new
generation that they are as relevant today as they were during the
Holocaust or in helping to create the state of Israel. Attempting
to address the criticism that they are out of touch with modern
Jewish life, the two organizations have reached an agreement in
principal to join forces to create a new national organization that
better reflects the changing priorities of the Jewish world.

   EUROPE-AIRCONDITIONING (Rome) _ While America rushed to cool its
air, Europe traditionally just took summer afternoons off. Stores
in Italy shut for the noonday heat, and Spaniards took siestas. In
the evening, Europe sat outside in the piazza. In the hottest
weeks, it simply shut down, and to this day August remains a dead
month in much of Europe. But the piazza has become polluted by
exhaust fumes, and the pressures of a global economy are
increasingly forcing Europeans to work summers. So Europeans are
belatedly embracing air-conditioning. By John Tagliabue.

UTILITIES JOIN THE INTERNET-ACCESS BUSINESS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ariz., N.C.)  (mk) 
 By MATT RICHTEL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   There's a new power in the Internet access business: your
utility company.
</P>
<P>
   A growing number of electric companies _ once slow-moving,
government-regulated monopolies _ are getting into one of the most
rapidly changing businesses. At least 100 utility companies offer
Internet access, including more than 30 of the nation's biggest
electricity providers, and dozens of others may follow suit.
</P>
<P>
   At the larger end are the likes of Arizona Public Service, whose
Phoenix-based subsidiary, Cyber Trails, has grown into one of the
top 10 Internet service companies in the state. At the other end of
the spectrum is Plumas-Sierra Rural Electric Cooperative, a power
provider nestled in the Northern Sierra Nevada mountains that also
serves about 2,000 dial-up Internet customers.
</P>
<P>
   Large or small, electric companies are moving into the Internet
business because of utility deregulation. Eighteen states have
opened their power industries to some form of competition, and most
others are expected eventually to do so as well. That means the
utilities not only have to learn to compete, they have more reason
to seek new sources of revenue.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, many power companies already have the
telecommunications infrastructures that their Internet subsidiaries
could use to serve outside customers.
</P>
<P>
   So more than 100 utilities have turned to telecommunications,
including long-distance, wireless and local phone service, cable
television access, home security systems and, now, Internet access.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have another business in this building, another way to pay
rent,'' said Robert Marshall, general manager of Plumas-Sierra and
its Internet access subsidiary, Plumas-Sierra Local Net. ``It will
help us hold our own in the big wide world when electricity
deregulation hits.''
</P>
<P>
   The power companies are joining a host of other businesses in
trying to own a piece of the ground floor of cyberspace. Aspiring
Internet access providers range from mom-and-pop operations to
giant long-distance carriers like AT&AMP;T, MCI Communications and
Sprint, and radio and cable television stations. Even while there
has been some consolidation among large and regional Internet
service providers, their overall number has exploded to 4,850 from
1,500 in the last five years, according to Boardwatch Magazine, an
industry trade journal.
</P>
<P>
   The growth and diversity of Internet service providers means
``you can't even recognize what an ISP is anymore,'' said Jack
Rickard, editor of Boardwatch.
</P>
<P>
   For their part, power companies say providing Internet services
is a natural move for them. Across the country, many of the 180
large, investor-owned utilities own large fiber-optic networks that
they built for internal communication across states and among power
plants and field offices. They used only a portion of the capacity,
however, eventually leasing it out to telecommunications
businesses. Now, they are developing their own telecommunications
businesses, including Internet access, said John Castagna, a
spokesman for the Edison Electric Institute, an electric industry
trade group.
</P>
<P>
   Castagna said 30 to 40 major utilities were offering Internet
access and others were considering it.
</P>
<P>
   Further, the power companies say they understand other crucial
aspects of the Internet business: billing, customer service and
computer networking.
</P>
<P>
   ``You already have expertise on the communications and you
already have expertise on the computer networking,'' said Ben
Preusser, business manager for Cyber Trails in Phoenix. ``All you
need to do is drop a line to the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it is not quite that easy. Since the utilities
themselves are regulated, any costs from the Internet business
cannot be passed on to power customers in the form of higher rates.
So the Internet subsidiaries must pay fees for using the utilities'
telecommunications infrastructure, and the start-up costs are the
responsibility of the utilities' parent companies and their
shareholders, not the utilities' rate payers.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona Public Service invested more than $2 million to get its
Cyber Trails subsidiary up and running, Preusser said. This
involved buying modems, routers _which route Internet traffic to
the proper destination _ and establishing a high-speed line into
the backbone of the Internet. Cyber Trails also leases data lines
from US West and from Arizona Public Service.
</P>
<P>
   Cyber Trails, which began offering Internet access in March
1997, has 6,000 dial-up customers, adds 20 new ones a day, and has
one of the 10 largest subscriber bases in the state, Preusser said.
He said the company had marketed aggressively, going after rural
areas that national Internet service providers had ignored, and
also had contracts to provide access to several Indian
reservations.
</P>
<P>
   Preusser said the new business was helping Arizona Public
Service learn about the challenges of moving into a new business in
a competitive marketplace _ knowledge that should prove beneficial
as the utility heads into a deregulated and much more competitive
electricity marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a different set of skills,'' he said. ``It turns out that
just leveraging your existing technology doesn't work all that
great.''
</P>
<P>
   Carol Heiberger, an energy and telecommunications consultant in
Philadelphia, has a similar view, noting that the relatively low
cost of offering Internet access gives utilities the chance to
experiment with a new business model. ``They're practicing running
a competitive business to see what it looks like,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Heiberger, who has written extensively on the efforts by
utilities to offer Internet access, said there was no guarantee
that power companies could succeed in this business. On the one
hand, she said, they have infrastructure, marketing, brand
recognition and customer service experience; on the other, they are
not accustomed to the fast-moving world of technology.

</P>
<P>
   Still, the potential problems did not discourage Carolina Power
and Light, which serves 1.1 million residences with electricity,
from entering the Internet business. In January, it acquired
Interpath Communications, a company that provides consulting, Web
page hosting and design, and Internet access to 4,500 businesses in
North Carolina, as well as surrounding states.
</P>
<P>
   The experience of Carolina Power and Light also highlights an
approach taken by dozens of utility companies entering the
telecommunications business: Rather than building from scratch, as
in Arizona, they are buying existing Internet companies or signing
joint ventures with major telecommunications providers. A year ago,
for example, a subsidiary of Potomac Electric Power Co., which
serves Maryland and the District of Columbia, pledged to spend $150
million to develop long-distance, cable television and Internet
services in partnership with RCN Corp., a major telecommunications
provider.
</P>
<P>
   There are other reasons some utilities turn to the Internet.
Warren Dunn, director of communication for National Rural Electric
Cooperative Association, said that at least 60 of the nation's
1,000 rural cooperatives offered Internet access, in part because
they consider it part of their charter to serve their communities.
</P>
<P>
   Marshall, the general manager of Plumas-Sierra, said the utility
cooperative felt it had a responsibility to provide Internet access
in a region others were ignoring.
</P>
<P>
   Before the electric company started its Internet subsidiary in
the fall of 1995, residents of the area had to place a
long-distance call to get Internet access.
</P>
<P>
   ``We felt advanced technology would not be available unless we
stepped up to do the job,'' Marshall said.

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ When Barry Diller hired Candice Carpenter to start
Q2, an upscale home shopping channel for QVC Inc. in 1994, the
words of wisdom he offered, she said, ran counter to everything she
had learned about business.
</P>
<P>
   ``He told me, `Anything worth doing is worth doing badly,'''
said Ms. Carpenter, who had been a consumer marketing executive for
American Express and president of Time-Life Video and Television.
``Getting used to imperfection and evolving on the fly, for me, was
the most important takeaway.''
</P>
<P>
   And indeed, the notion that flaws are necessary ingredients of a
new business prepared her for what she describes as the ``wild
adolescence'' of the Internet, whose full surge she would
experience a year later. After a management change upon Diller's
departure from QVC, Ms. Carpenter also left the company and took
the leap from old media to new by creating the Web site
iVillage.com with a group of investors that included America
Online.
</P>
<P>
   iVillage.com began with little more than the premise ``Internet
for the rest of us'' and a focus on baby boomers. After
encountering its share of false starts (like a site, ``Vices and
Virtues,'' now defunct, about the competing forces of indulgence
and health), it has evolved into the leading women's online
``community'' on the Web. It attracted more than 2 million
different visitors during June, according to the Web measurement
company Relevant Knowledge.
</P>
<P>
   ``Join our community of smart, compassionate, real women
today,'' the iVillage.com home page invites visitors, offering an
array of news, columns, advice and tips. Most important, though, it
offers ample opportunity for women to contribute their own views
through chat sessions and message boards on topics like ``Sex After
Kids'' and ``Anger Management.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the company has dealt with turnover of personnel and a
refocusing of its mission, the one constant has been Ms. Carpenter
and her ability to raise financing for the enterprise. The company
closed a fourth round of venture capital financing in May with
$32.5 million from 10 sources, bringing the total sum raised to $67
million.
</P>
<P>
   What is it that investors find attractive about an Internet
business for which profits are not yet in sight and which bills
itself amorphously in its new television advertising campaign as
``Your Home on the Web for the Stuff that Matters''? Besides the
large women's audience and its drawing power among advertisers,
iVillage.com's lure to investors is Ms. Carpenter herself, analysts
say.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's a media celebrity,'' said Janet Stites, publisher of
Alley Cat News, a trade publication for investors. ``She's an
intriguing personality. Those things are very important when you're
raising money.''
</P>
<P>
   Especially when the medium for which one is raising money is
untested. Particularly in the early days of the World Wide Web,
when it was perceived as a technological oddity as much as a
burgeoning mass medium, the fact that Ms. Carpenter, 46, was not
another twenty-something Internet prodigy with no previous business
experience helped attract investors who wanted to test the waters.
</P>
<P>
   That iVillage.com shifted gears from a broader audience and
chose to focus on a demographic in demand didn't hurt, either.
</P>
<P>
   ``They picked a category that's very interesting,'' said Habib
Kairuz, the managing director of Rho Management, a recent investor
in iVillage.com. ``The trend continues to grow very nicely.'' Women
now make up half of all new Internet users, as opposed to just a
third two years ago.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``The competition was not like that in search engines,'' Kairuz
said. ``This was a management team that really looked at what
worked on the Internet in establishing a new brand. They are not
looking at duplicating other mediums by simply putting their
content on the Web.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, iVillage.com has positioned itself as what could be
called the un-content provider. The emphasis is more on what
visitors to the site can contribute on the particulars of
parenthood, relationships and workplace issues, rather than on
top-tier columnists spouting advice and other more traditional
editorial offerings used by established media companies.
</P>
<P>
   Even its coming series of books, to be published by NTC
Contemporary, a division of Tribune Co., consists of information
culled from the users of iVillage.com's first Web offering, Parent
Soup.
</P>
<P>
   Along with more traditional marketing tactics, like a television
campaign, the company has hired Catheren Woolard, a city
councilwoman in Atlanta, to do grass-roots community building,
organizing volunteers around the country to act on behalf of
iVillage.com, and introducing the site to various nonprofit women's
organizations.
</P>
<P>
   This, Ms. Carpenter says, maximizes the strength of the medium
in which she dwells. ``We offer the intimacy of community with the
scale of media,'' she said, describing iVillage.com as
``utilitarian.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Carpenter and her co-founders, Nancy Evans and Robert
Levitan _ who are also New York media veterans _ oversee a staff of
more than 200 who are scattered across two buildings in converted
loft space in Manhattan's Silicon Alley.
</P>
<P>
   Their site now attracts nearly twice the traffic of its nearest
competitor, Women.com, according to Relevant Knowledge. Such sites
deliver demographic gems to advertisers: high-income, well-educated
women.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Carpenter has tried to generate revenue from three different
sources: advertising, sponsorship of specific areas of the site,
and product sales, including in its own online store, iBaby.
</P>
<P>
   It will take not only those elements but a lot more capital for
iVillage.com to prevail, Ms. Stites said. ``Experienced management
in the corporate world doesn't translate into experienced
management in the start-up world,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   For her part, Ms. Carpenter said it took a ``gunslinger'' to
work in this industry. ``In the Internet, you've had to place
bigger bets in order to win,'' Ms. Carpenter said. ``I would not
want to be doing this without a media background.''

PALESTINIANS THREATEN TO WITHDRAW FROM PEACE TALKS
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By DOUGLAS JEHL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ The prospects for a new accord between Israel and
the Palestinians dimmed further Sunday as senior Palestinian
officials said they were prepared to pull out of peace talks unless
Israel showed a swift willingness to consider new ideas.
</P>
<P>
   A senior adviser to Yasser Arafat, the Palestinian leader, said
that negotiations scheduled for Monday would be ``the last
meeting'' between the two sides unless Israel came up with a new
answer to an American-backed plan calling for it to withdraw from
an additional 13 percent of the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has
resisted that plan for months, while the Palestinians have publicly
accepted it. Even so, the new Palestinian warning injected a darker
air into sporadic negotiations between the two sides, which
Arafat's Cabinet declared on Saturday to have been ``a waste of
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Nabil Abu Rdainah, an Arafat adviser, said that a meeting
scheduled for Monday ``must be decisive'' and that if it was not,
the Palestinians were prepared to complain anew to the United
States ``about this Israeli intransigence.''
</P>
<P>
   Associates of Netanyahu have said they believe the two sides are
making progress in the talks and that it will soon become evident
whether an agreement can be reached.
</P>
<P>
   But the new Palestinian warning added more urgency to the
discussions, and it posed a fresh challenge to a rash of recent
indications from the Israeli side that a breakthrough might be near
in the talks, which have been deadlocked for the last 16 months.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they don't bring new ideas during tomorrow's meeting, it
will be the last,'' Abu Rdainah said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Israel has refused to accept the American-backed
plan, Arafat has until now been reluctant to break off talks
between the two sides. He is apparently not eager to be blamed for
a collapse in the negotiations, despite the lack of progress.
</P>
<P>
   In recent days, however, Arafat has come under mounting pressure
from other leading Palestinians to call a halt to the discussions.
Officials of his political party, Fatah, have said such a
declaration would serve to convey that Israel-Palestinian relations
had reached a new point of crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Under the Oslo peace accords between Israel and the
Palestinians, the Israelis were to have completed new troop
withdrawals from the West Bank more than a year ago, and their
refusal to do so has provoked friction not just with the
Palestinians, but also with the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The details of the American-backed plan calling for the 13
percent withdrawal have never been made public. But U.S. officials
have made clear their deep frustration at the refusal of
Netanyahu's government to embrace it.
</P>
<P>
   Martin Indyk, the State Department official who oversees the
Middle East, said last week that the quest for a broader peace
between Israel and the Palestinians was ``only just'' alive and
that it faced ``a still uncertain future.''
</P>
<P>
   The sporadic talks between Israel and the Palestinians have
continued in recent days despite the recent rejection by Washington
of a Palestinian request for more vigorous American intervention to
unravel the impasse. Clinton administration officials have said it
is time instead for the two sides to demonstrate the good will
necessary to solve disputes, both now and in the future.
</P>
<P>
   In recent days, the Israeli delegation has been led by Danny
Naveh, Netanyahu's Cabinet secretary, while the Palestinian side
has been led by Saeb Erekat, a top Palestinian negotiator. Israeli
Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai and the top Palestinian
negotiator, Mahmoud Abbas, held higher-level talks late last month,
but those discussions were suspended after they proved
inconclusive.
</P>
<P>
   Unless a breakthrough comes soon, the warning from Arafat's
aides seemed bound to put pressure on Washington either to
reconsider its standoffnishness or to brace for the prospect of
violent new protests in Palestinian-governed areas if the talks are
seen to have failed.
</P>
<P>
   In what has been a firm stand, Netanyahu has consistently
refused to cede any more than another 10 percent of the West Bank
to the Palestinians in the next phase of troop withdrawals, which
are more than a year overdue. For the last several weeks, his
negotiators have been floating a potential compromise.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal calls for what would amount to a 13 percent
withdrawal, but the disputed 3 percent would be set aside as a new
nature reserve in the Judean Desert east of Bethlehem, where
Palestinian building and settlement would be prohibited and where
Israel would maintain a security role.
</P>
<P>
   So far, that proposal has been rejected by Palestinian
negotiators, who have said they could endorse the idea only if the
nature reserve were entrusted to full Palestinian control.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Josh Mackenzie, a 24-year-old motorcycle mechanic
from Brooklyn, ambled up the ramp of the Solomon R. Guggenheim
Museum the other day looking a bit bewildered. ``This is my first
visit here,'' he said. ``I don't go to museums a lot, and it will
probably be a long while before I ever come back.''
</P>
<P>
   Mackenzie, who was clad in well-worn blue jeans and a black
T-shirt that revealed some of his 14 tattoos, is no standout at the
Guggenheim these days. Ponytailed bikers in leather vests have
become regulars. In waiting lines that regularly snake around the
building, they are joined by families on a day's outing, curious
couples and museum regulars, their path marked by dozens of
Harley-Davidson and BMW cycles parked at the curb with license
plates from as far away as New Hampshire, Virginia and Florida.
</P>
<P>
   The cause of this convergence, to the consternation of more
traditionalist elements in the art world, is ``The Art of the
Motorcycle,'' an exhibition quite different from anything else that
the Museum Mile on Fifth Avenue has ever experienced. Bathed in
biker glory, it has become the most highly attended exhibition in
the Guggenheim's 61-year history, far outstripping retrospectives
of Robert Rauschenberg, Roy Lichtenstein and Ellsworth Kelly and
more popular than authoritative surveys of Chinese, Russian and
Italian art.
</P>
<P>
   And the crowds are growing steadily. Right now, the average
attendance at the relatively modest-size museum is about 45 percent
higher than normal, with more than 5,000 people a day visiting on
the weekends. If this popularity continues, Guggenheim officials
say, they expect more than 500,000 people to have seen ``The Art of
the Motorcycle'' by the time it closes on Sept. 20, and they
estimate that the museum could make upward of $1 million on ticket
and retail sales alone.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the sales: The exhibition's 427-page color catalog ($85
for the hardcover; $45 for the paperback) has gone through a first
printing of 30,000, and a second printing is under way. Along with
the de rigueur motorcycle books, mugs, T-shirts, beach blankets,
posters and postcards, there are a Ducati windbreaker ($45), ``The
Henna Body Art Kit: Everything You Need to Create Stunning
Temporary Tattoos'' ($29.95), a child's red plastic BMW motorcycle
($120) and a full set of bright red or yellow Ducati one-piece
leather jump suits ($1,595).
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Krens, the Guggenheim's director, who is the show's
curator and owns two motorcycles (a 1974 BMW R90/6 and a 1998 BMW
R111 GS), said he was not surprised by the success. ``Motorcycles
are all about fantasy, fear, danger, and these issues are out there
right now,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Krens, one of the museum world's consummate showmen, says that
much of the popularity has to do with the serious way the show is
presented. The Los Angeles architect Frank Gehry wrapped the
interior of the Wright rotunda with shiny stainless-steel panels _
a metaphor for the machine _ so that the building looks like a
glistening jewel box in which 113 motorcycles are parked all the
way up the Guggenheim's ramp.
</P>
<P>
   On display is a chronological look at motorcycles beginning on
the museum's ground floor with the earliest-known example, the 1868
French velocipede, which resembles a bicycle with a steam engine
under its seat, all the way up to a shiny red-and-gray MV Agusta
F4, this year's hottest Italian motorcycle. Created by a noted
designer, Massimo Tamburini, it has a four-cylinder engine designed
by the Ferrari car company and looks like something Batman would
ride in the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
   But is it art?
</P>
<P>
   The exhibition has left some cognoscenti groaning.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Guggenheim might bring in more people if they offered
rides from Coney Island,'' said Stephen Mazoh, a private art dealer
from Rhinebeck, N.Y., whose clients have included some of this
country's most important collectors, among them Walter Annenberg,
Ronald Lauder, Leonard Lauder and Donald Marron. ``Motorcycles
belong in a design museum or a museum for automobiles, but not at
the Guggenheim,'' Mazoh said. ``They may think they're getting a
new audience, but none of these people will come back.''
</P>
<P>
   Krens said the show never made the claim that motorcycles were
art. ``We are interested in 20th-century culture,'' he said.
``Obviously we're extending the traditional frame of the museum.
Motorcycles gave us a rich cultural narrative, and this show is a
serious attempt to look at an icon of our time.''
</P>
<P>
   More than 30 iconically inclined motorcycle clubs have flooded
the museum with group ticket requests, including the Cobras M.C. of
Jamaica, Queens; the Star of David M.C. of Brooklyn and others from
as far away as North Carolina and Wisconsin.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was everyone's first time at the Guggenheim,'' said Don
Miller, who with his wife, Peg, organized a museum outing for 21
members of the Bucks County Motorcycle Association, a 2-year-old
club from Bristol, Pa. ``The group particularly enjoyed the old
gray Harley. It was the town-and-country exhaust that opened and
closed that they thought was pretty cool.'' (He was referring to
the 1911 Harley-Davidson Model 7D, popularly known as ``the silent
gray fellow.'') Because museum officials had warned the group about
the difficulties of parking in Manhattan, its members took a train
to New York rather than riding their motorcycles, Miller said.
</P>
<P>
   After the show, the group had lunch at the Harley-Davidson Cafe
at the Avenue of the Americas and 56th Street.
</P>
<P>
   As with any museum show, the Guggenheim is offering the public
educational programs. Last Tuesday night, Dennis Hopper was the
pedagogical attraction, addressing a standing-room-only crowd in
the museum auditorium.
</P>
<P>
   ``Motorcycles are such a document of our time,'' Hopper said.
``When you think of the early years of this century, you think of
the beginning of the machine age.''

</P>
<P>
   But when the average visitor thinks of a motorcycle, he thinks
of the chrome-laden Harley-Davidson, with so-called ``ape hanger''
handlebars and low-slung seat, that Hopper rode in ``Easy Rider,''
the classic 1969 biker movie. A 1993 one-of-a-kind replica of it
has become the Mona Lisa of the show. Called either by its proper
name, the Harley-Davidson ``Easy Rider'' Chopper, or more popularly
Captain America, for the name of the character played in the film
by Peter Fonda, it is emblazoned with the American flag motif on
the gas tank and the helmet.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always got a crowd around it,'' said Scott Gutterman,
director of public affairs for the museum. ``This is the one that
crystallized the image of the motorcycle in the public's
imagination. It ushered in a new era that's still with us.''
</P>
<P>
   For women who ride motorcycles, the Ducati Monster is also the
rage. ``I saw three women ride up to the museum on them last
Sunday,'' said Ultan Guilfoyle, the Guggenheim's curatorial adviser
to the show. ``The look of them is aggressive yet sexy. In Italy,
the 600-cc model is selling right now to more women than men.'' On
view in the show is the M900 Monster 904-cc.
</P>
<P>
   The museum is also attracting large numbers of younger art
lovers. ``I like the Honda best,'' said Steven Weiner, 7, who was
wearing a baseball cap backward and could not stop ogling the Easy
Rider bike, which, in fact, is a Harley. ``I want one when I grow
up.''
</P>
<P>
   Lashmi Mechkouk, a Moroccan-born teacher who is visiting New
York from Paris, heard about the show by watching satellite
television. ``I knew I wanted to see the show as soon as I got to
New York,'' he said. ``I own a Suzuki that's 35 years old, and it
still runs well. One day I'd like to rent some Harley-Davidsons
with some friends and tour through the U.S.''
</P>
<P>
   Tim Rast, an engineer from Minneapolis, and his wife, Martha,
said they were amazed by the show's vast selection. ``You can go to
bike rallies and swap meets, but you'll never see this span of
bikes,'' said Rast, who sported braids and tattoos. ``They're too
rare.''
</P>
<P>
   Some visitors got past the sheer number of vehicles to reflect
on the bikes as objects of industrial design. ``They're about form
and function,'' said Dennis Huskins, a Harley-Davidson owner who is
an internist from Stamford, Conn. ``Now my mind can understand what
an engineer was thinking in 1915.''
</P>
<P>
   All this said, the museum has also drawn the
motorcycle-challenged.
</P>
<P>
   ``My cousin has a 14-year-old son visiting from Knoxville,
Tenn., and we thought this was something he'd be interested in,''
said Victoria Olds, 81, who carefully examined each bike. ``My
experience with motorcycles has only been the loud noise they make
on the street. But I'm learning. They're really very beautiful
machines.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Talk about tough beginnings.
</P>
<P>
   Even as Stephen Smith was struggling last week to find his
footing as editor of U.S. News &AMP; World Report, his predecessor,
James Fallows, was hashing out his severance agreement with the
magazine's owner, Mortimer Zuckerman, and fielding a 10-page memo
from the company's editorial director, Harold Evans, that disputed
Fallows' portrayal of his departure.
</P>
<P>
   At least nine staff members are on their way out or have already
left. Smith, 49, is walking into a job in which few editors have
lasted more than two years. Not to mention that Smith was not even
supposed to have started until the end of August. Instead, events
accelerated in late June because of a now-infamous 19-page memo in
which Fallows announced that he had been dismissed, and Smith found
himself starting at U.S. News from his office at National Journal.
</P>
<P>
   As The New York Post summed it up in the first line of a gossip
item on Page Six last month: ``Steve Smith is doomed.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Poor Steve Smith,'' said one editor at U.S. News who, like
most of those interviewed, insisted on anonymity. ``Things were
delicate enough without Harry or whoever not letting this Fallows
thing die.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Smith said he was undeterred. ``This is a tough
time because I'm trying to learn 225 names, learn how the magazine
works, do some good journalism and stabilize a staff that's feeling
pretty roughed up right now,'' he said. ``Someone said to me when I
took this job that it would require someone as pigheaded as I am to
do it right, and I am absolutely determined to keep moving this
magazine forward and not keep looking over my shoulder.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith has some experience to fall back on. He spent a year and a
half as editor of National Journal, taking the weekly political
magazine through a substantial redesign. Before that, he spent a
year as the founding editor of Civilization, the magazine
affiliated with the Library of Congress. And he grew up around
newsweeklies, serving in several positions at Time magazine from
1978 to 1986, including nation editor, and as executive editor of
Newsweek from 1986 until he was dismissed in 1991 after being
passed over for the top job.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's definitely the person for the job over there because he
has a very clear idea of what he wants to do,'' said Evan Thomas,
an assistant managing editor at Newsweek, who worked with Smith.
</P>
<P>
   Smith's extensive experience with newsweeklies may serve him
well, given that Zuckerman has said he wants to move the magazine
back to a more conventional news magazine format, emphasizing the
previous week's headlines.
</P>
<P>
   But some reporters and editors inside and outside U.S. News
insist that the magazine cannot compete on that ground; with fewer
resources, a smaller staff and earlier deadlines than Time and
Newsweek, they say, U.S. News needs to carve out its own distinct
role.
</P>
<P>
   Smith said he would try to strike a balance between breaking
news stories, enterprise articles and the kind of ``News You Can
Use'' service pieces that have become the magazine's signature.
``You don't have to be a slave to the news,'' he said, ``but you
have to respect it.''
</P>
<P>
   But working for Zuckerman may require skills that would confound
any resume. In the 14 years that he has owned U.S. News, Zuckerman
has gone through five editors before Fallows. ``No editor who has
stood up to Mort has lasted here,'' one U.S. News editor said.
</P>
<P>
   Zuckerman has been similarly finicky at The Daily News of New
York _ which he also owns, along with The Atlantic Monthly and Fast
Company, a business magazine. The newspaper is on its fifth editor
in the five years that Zuckerman has owned it.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Zuckerman has enthusiastically supported Smith. ``I am
so thrilled about how effectively and quickly he has taken hold in
rather difficult circumstances,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   To complicate matters, Evans has been added to this mercurial
mix since he left Random House last fall. While some people at
Zuckerman's publications have welcomed Evans' editorial oversight,
they also say that the Fallows situation showed him to be consumed
with appearing in control. After Fallows announced his dismissal in
June, Evans issued a memo to the staff emphasizing that it was he
who had determined Fallows' fate, not Zuckerman, as Fallows had
suggested.
</P>
<P>
   Then last week, Evans wrote a memo to Fallows, first reported in
The Washington Post, accusing the former editor of misrepresenting
his departure as having to do with journalistic differences rather
than more severance money.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, people at U.S. News say, Smith will have to contend
with editorial meddling by Zuckerman and Evans.
</P>
<P>
   Zuckerman has long been known for picking up the phone to weigh
in on a coming article minutes before deadline or to criticize an
editor about something already published.
</P>
<P>
   Now Evans has added another layer; he offered his 2 cents on the
U.S. News article about the departure of his wife, Tina Brown, from
The New Yorker _ saying, for example, that she has generated
profits at her publications and not just buzz. And he plans to run
a 10-part excerpt from his coming book, ``The American Century,''
in U.S. News this fall. Evans also recently told the staff that
anyone who spoke ill of the magazine _ publicly or privately _
would be dismissed.
</P>
<P>
   Smith said such potential interference did not make him nervous.
``Probably the most meddlesome owner in the 20th century was Henry
Luce,'' he said, referring to the founding editor of Time magazine.
``I've worked at a lot of places, and owners and publishers are
usually engaged to one extent or another with their publications.''
</P>
<P>
   People who have worked with Smith describe him as precisely the
type of level-headed professional to deal with this baggage.
Writers who have been edited by him over the years also praise his
ear for elegant prose and his eye for arresting graphics.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was painstaking about the choice of words,'' said Michael
Kelly, who Smith brought in as a columnist at National Journal and
is now serving as the magazine's acting editor. ``Our discussions
tended to be whether this was a graceful enough turn of phrase;
whether there was a funnier way to say something; whether we were
veering too close to cliche.''

 NEW YORK: to cliche.'' 
<TEXT>
<P>
   But some others have had problems with Smith along the way.
Stories that dog Smith, which he acknowledges are true, include his
accidentally sending an insulting computer message to the person he
was gossiping about, Alexis Gelber, an assistant managing editor at
Newsweek.
</P>
<P>
   Another involves a visit to Newsweek by the Rev. Jesse Jackson
during the 1988 presidential campaign, during which Smith kept
insisting that Jackson had grown up in Philadelphia, and only later
realized he had confused him with Reggie Jackson, the baseball
player.
</P>
<P>
   Some former colleagues describe Smith as rigid and say he can be
snobbish and imperious, though none would criticize him on the
record.
</P>
<P>
   Born and raised on the Upper East Side of Manhattan, the son of
a partner in a Wall Street brokerage firm and an editor of women's
magazines, Smith attended Deerfield Academy and the University of
Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   He lives with his wife, the writer Sally Bedell Smith, in
Washington. They have one son, 14, and Ms. Smith has two children
from a previous marriage. Smith describes himself politically as
somewhat right of center. ``I am not an ideological guy,'' he said.
``I got into journalism not to save the world but to do good
stories.''
</P>
<P>
   He likes golf, tennis and shooting and is known for dressing
well. ``He wears bespoke suits,'' said Sarah Crichton, vice
president and publisher of Little, Brown &AMP; Co., who worked with
Smith at Newsweek. ``He never owned a pair of jeans in his life and
is proud of it.''
</P>
<P>
   But Smith also seems to have a sense of humor about his
squareness. ``Let's just say Rabbit Angstrom in his dotage,'' he
said, comparing himself to the John Updike character. ``I don't own
a pair of jeans, but I deny that I'm proud.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess,'' Smith added, ``I would consider myself a stuffed
shirt.''
</P>
<P>
   Given that Smith's former colleagues describe him as stiff, his
experience at U.S. News may test his capacity for more touchy-feely
management; healing seems to be what the staff needs most right
now.
</P>
<P>
   Many employees say they are embittered about the ousting of
Fallows and some are mystified by it _ several say Evans had
enthusiastically supported Fallows right up until the end.
Explanations have ranged from personality conflicts to
philosophical differences to the theory that Fallows simply stood
up to Zuckerman one time too many.
</P>
<P>
   Evans said the dismissal had to do with Fallows' performance.
``I tried to be supportive of Jim _ he did many good things,'' he
said. ``But for U.S. News there were rather too many
disappointments, which I told him week by week.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, both Evans and Zuckerman said they did not want to
rehash the past; as of Friday, Fallows was still negotiating a
severance package with Zuckerman. Smith said he was staying out of
it. ``I was advised before I came that this was not my fight,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   So far, people at the magazine say, Smith has done a masterful
job at urging the staff to band together. Nevertheless, the turmoil
has cost the magazine several key casualties, including Ronald
Brownstein, a senior writer, who is returning to The Los Angeles
Times; Timothy Noah, the special projects editor; Steven Waldman,
the national editor, and Stephen Budiansky, the deputy editor.
</P>
<P>
   Given these defections, Smith is trying to hire at a difficult
time. ``It is not exactly an ideal recruiting environment,'' one
editor said.
</P>
<P>
   But Smith said he was pressing ahead, as he must. ``The people
who work here are real pros,'' he said. ``They want to do good
work, and I think if we can make it through this bit of a rough
patch right now _ and I know we can _ we can get in a groove and do
good work and put out a good magazine.''

   C0X-POLMONEY _ WASHINGTON _ After months of legislative
slogging, House supporters of the main bipartisan proposal for
cleaning up campaign finances are looking forward to the climactic
floor vote on their legislation Monday evening. Rep. Chris Shays,
R-Conn., who joined Rep. Martin Meehan, D-Mass., in co-sponsoring
the bill, compared Monday's vote to a late-season game in which a
baseball team can cinch an American League pennant. ``I want to get
into the World Series with a passion,'' he said Sunday in an
interview. During weeks of debate, supporters defeated all 15 of
the ``poison pill'' amendments that could have torpedoed the
legislation. (Mollison, Cox News Service).

of his hemisphere; on weekends they filled the shops and

Army colonel, serves on a far different post. A Miami business park

 &HT;    HOUSE SET TO VOTE ON CAMPAIGN FINANCE BILL
 &HT;    By ANDREW MOLLISON 
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ House supporters of the main bipartisan proposal
for revising campaign finance laws are looking forward to the
climactic floor vote on their legislation Monday evening.
</P>
<P>
   Shrugging off months of delay, U.S. Rep. Martin Meehan of
Massachusetts, the chief Democratic co-sponsor of the bill,
predicted that it is ``going to pass'' the House.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Chris Shays of Connecticut, the chief Republican
co-sponsor, was more circumspect. The bill ``should pass the
House,'' he said Sunday in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   Comparing Monday's vote to a play-off game for the American
League pennant, Shays said, ``I want to get into the World Series
with a passion.''
</P>
<P>
   The Shays-Meehan bill would close the ``soft money'' loophole
that lets political parties obtain contributions of unlimited size,
and would tighten disclosure and contribution rules for groups that
pay for radio or television ads that mention candidates just before
an election.
</P>
<P>
   Last-minute lobbying by Common Cause, the League of Women Voters
and other Shays-Meehan supporters, as well as by opponents led by
the National Right to Life Committee and the Christian Coalition
wasn't expected to have much effect. If there is one topic that
House members know intimately without outside assistance, it is the
ins and outs of raising money for political parties and campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   The bill's supporters hope to get far more than the 218 votes
needed to keep their bill alive in the 435-member House. Nine
possible substitutes for their bill have yet to be considered, and
only the version with the most votes will be considered for final
passage.
</P>
<P>
   The House will complete action on all the bills before it
adjourns Friday, Aug. 7 for its month-long summer break, promised
Majority Leader Richard K. Armey, R-Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Republican filibusters have blocked action on similar bills
twice within the last year. But supporters expect the passage of a
House version to increase the pressure on senators.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the bill passes the House, the American people will
expect the Senate, when it returns from the August recess, to act
on campaign finance reform,'' said Sen. Russell Feingold, D-Wis.
``I intend to make sure that happens.''
</P>
<P>
   During the past month, Shays and Meehan united their forces in
defeating 15 different amendments that they said could have made
the bill too weak to bother with or too strong to pass.
</P>
<P>
   Final vote results posted by the House Clerk show that in each
of those 15 test votes, they retained support from at least 175
Democrats and 18 Republicans, while at times picking up as many as
200 Democratic and 118 Republican votes.

CHINESE POLICE END THE REIGN OF `BIG SPENDER' AND HIS MOB
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By SETH FAISON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   GUANGZHOU, China _ On a back street in this mangy city, where
thick steam bubbles off woks at outdoor food stalls and mah-jongg
tiles can be heard clacking late into the evening, a gang of Hong
Kong mobsters often met in a well-guarded house to plot their most
lucrative capers.
</P>
<P>
   The gang got its start years ago by robbing jewelry stores in
Hong Kong, then retreating across the Chinese border to hide here
because the local police were either too inept or corrupt to care.
The gang's most spectacular crime came in 1996, police now say, by
kidnapping the son of one of Hong Kong's richest businessmen and
getting away with a staggering $125 million in ransom.
</P>
<P>
   The gang's leader, known as ``Big Spender'' for his habit of
dropping a million dollars a shot at a favorite casino in the
nearby Portuguese colony of Macau, seemed to typify the excesses of
organized crime that flourished in southern China in step with an
economic boom in the 1990s. Big Spender, whose real name is Cheung
Tze-keung, may have been the most wanted man in Hong Kong, but in
this part of China he became a folk hero for his apparent
invincibility.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, after a series of brazen robberies, murders and
kidnappings, Cheung's gang was officially pronounced dead. China's
national police seized 32 people they described as his accomplices.
They also seized nearly $5 million in cash, 11 luxury cars and a
cache of explosives and firearms.
</P>
<P>
   Cheung was not only in custody, police said, but had confessed
to the gang's role in murder, robbery, kidnapping and smuggling
explosives. What Cheung actually said, and how he pleads, will
probably remain as secret as other case files in China.
</P>
<P>
   The gang's downfall is the latest chapter in the curious
evolution of lawlessness that straddles the border between Hong
Kong and Guangdong province, an area with a rich history of secret
societies, pirates and criminal intrigue.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it is a sign that Asia's mounting economic woes are
hurting criminals, too. More likely, it is a kind of poetic justice
for a singularly talented gangster and his crew, who had a
remarkably long run before getting caught.
</P>
<P>
   For years, Cheung took advantage of the wide cracks that exist
between distinctly separate law enforcement agencies in Hong Kong
and Guangdong, which have long mistrusted each other's methods and
principles.
</P>
<P>
   Bouncing back and forth over the border as it suited him, Cheung
was able to capitalize on the poor communication between police on
each side. Even since Hong Kong's return to Chinese rule last year,
cooperation between the police forces has been limited.
</P>
<P>
   Now, however, the tables have turned on Cheung. This time he is
likely to fare worse from the cross-border confusion, not better.
</P>
<P>
   Ordinarily, Hong Kong police ask for the return of a Hong Kong
citizen who commits crimes in Hong Kong but is arrested in
Guangdong.
</P>
<P>
   But this time, Hong Kong police have raised no objection to
seeing Cheung's case handled in Guangdong, where being charged is a
virtual guarantee of being found guilty and where the penalty for
any serious violent crime is usually a swift execution. Were Cheung
to be tried in Hong Kong, he would have at least have a chance at
acquittal, a trick he pulled off once before on an armed robbery
charge.
</P>
<P>
   Zhang Xingfeng, director of the criminal investigation bureau of
Beijing's Ministry of Public Security, said Cheung's major crimes
were planned in Guangzhou, so his case will be handled by the
Guangdong provincial authorities. Many of the plans were made,
Zhang said, in one of 50 properties owned by Cheung and his gang.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to murder and kidnapping, Zhang also said, the gang
had smuggled more than 1,500 pounds of explosives from Guangdong
into Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
   Of the gang members, 18 were Hong Kong residents and 14 were
from mainland China, Zhang said. Just over half were arrested here
on July 22; the rest were apprehended on July 29.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of the arrests were made in the mainland after six months
of investigations carried out with the support and cooperation of
the Hong Kong police,'' Zhang said at a news conference in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Cheung himself was actually apprehended in January, after a
tip from an informer led police into a long cat-and-mouse chase
that ended in Jiangmen, a city south of here, where Cheung was
caught trying to escape in a taxi cab.
</P>
<P>
   Hardly the image of the hard-nosed, tough-jawed outlaw that
dominates a popular genre of Hong Kong gangster movies, Cheung is a
slight man with a gently protruding forehead.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently enjoying the image of fancy cars and fast women that
comes with his territory, Cheung reveled in his aura of
invincibility in 1995, when Hong Kong's High Court acquitted him on
a technicality from an earlier conviction for armed robbery of an
armored truck at Kai Tak Airport.
</P>
<P>
   He had served 18 months in prison, apparently leaving him with
such serious grievances against the prison authorities that his
gang was suspected when a bulldozer suddenly demolished a prison
guard house one night. The next month, the home of Hong Kong's
secretary for security was fire-bombed.
</P>
<P>
   Hong Kong newspapers also reported that Cheung was behind a
bizarre plan to kidnap Anson Chan, Hong Kong's chief secretary, as
a way to win the release of a fellow gangster, Yip Kai-foon. The
plan was apparently foiled.
</P>
<P>
   Of all the gang's crimes, the most astonishing one was
undoubtedly the kidnapping of Victor Li, the son of Li Ka-shing,
Hong Kong's most powerful businessman, in May 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently fearful of more kidnapping attempts, neither father
nor son has ever spoken publicly about the kidnapping. Yet Hong
Kong media have reported that the Li family paid a ransom of one
billion Hong Kong dollars, worth $125 million, without telling the
Hong Kong police.
</P>
<P>
   Chinese police confirmed Cheung's role in the kidnapping and the
$125 million extortion. Police also argued that the crime was
planned in Guangzhou, justifying a prosecution here, even though it
was carried out in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
   Cheung, as the kidnapping's mastermind, awarded himself 40
percent of the take, or roughly $50 million, and split the other
$75 million among nine associates, a Hong Kong newspaper reported
</P>
<P>
   In a second high-profile kidnapping in September 1997, Cheung
took half of the $80 million extorted from the family of another
property tycoon, Walter Kwok of Sun Hung Kai Properties.
</P>
<P>
   Chinese accounts of Cheung's downfall suggested that it grew out
of the cooperation of a gang member. The Hong Kong media have also
reported that some Hong Kong property tycoons had quietly expressed
their concern about the danger of kidnapping in Hong Kong by
cross-border gangs to China's President, Jiang Zemin.
</P>
<P>
   Whether Cheung's arrest came about by pressure on the police
from Jiang, by a rare case of successful cooperation between
Guangdong and Hong Kong police, or simply by a lucky break, may
never become public. But Big Spender's days are over.

BRINGING CHINA ON LINE, WITH OFFICIAL BLESSINGS
</HEADLINE>
  (jw) 
 By MARK LANDLER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HONG KONG _ Peter Yip is not shy about his ambitions. As he
steers a visitor through the bustling offices of the China Internet
Corp. here, Yip describes how his company will be a catalyst for
bringing the Internet to China and its 1.2 billion people.
</P>
<P>
   Employees are busy collecting news dispatches from Reuters and
Bloomberg, which they send to Beijing to be translated into
Chinese. Later, China Internet will post the material on its
service, where anyone in China with a computer and the $30-a-month
subscription fee can log on to a world of Western news.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Chinese government recognizes that the Internet is a
global thing,'' said Yip, 43, the vice chairman of the company,
which is based in Hong Kong and backed by the official New China
News Agency _ not to mention an impressive array of American
technology companies. ``That's why they've established a strategy
and asked me to help them create a vehicle to allow people to
participate.''
</P>
<P>
   It is that kind of pronouncement that makes Yip's rivals seethe.
They say China Internet, known as CIC, is only one of dozens of
companies throughout the country that are racing to put China on
line. In China, as in the United States, the Internet seems to be
growing too rapidly _ and in too helter-skelter a way _ for any
single company to mastermind its development.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because the Internet has taken China by storm, there are very
different proposals about how to develop it,'' said Don Xia, chief
executive of Unicom Media, a Hong Kong company that is developing
Internet services for China Unicom, one of the country's two main
telephone companies.
</P>
<P>
   To Xia and others here, the debate is whether China's Internet
should be open or closed; raw or edited, anarchic or controlled.
Yip's company, they say, represents a more controlled,
government-directed approach. At the same time, hundreds of
small-time entrepreneurs, most of whom lack China Internet's
financial backing or political connections, are laboring to build a
truly free Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``CIC is out of step with what Internet users in China are
about,'' said Duncan Clark, managing director of BD Associates, a
telecommunications consulting firm in Beijing. ``I think companies
that make deals with them are actually doing themselves a
disservice.''
</P>
<P>
   The American companies that have made investments in China
Internet, or formed other kinds of partnerships with Yip, include
America Online, Bay Networks, Netscape Communications and Sun
Microsystems. And whatever the controversy that Yip may arouse, the
success of his sales pitch is proof that a Chinese Internet is no
longer just a utopian vision, but a ripe opportunity for sharp-eyed
entrepreneurs.
</P>
<P>
   According to the latest government statistics, 1.18 million
people are using the Internet in mainland China _ nearly double the
number last October. While cyberspace is still largely the preserve
of 20-something men, it is growing beyond its roots as a tool for
academics. Nearly 80 percent of those surveyed said they had bought
merchandise over the Internet, and many said they used it for
information about entertainment, sports and business.
</P>
<P>
   After much hand-wringing, Beijing seems to have decided that the
benefits of the Internet outweigh its dangers, although it still
filters the content of the World Wide Web through central computers
and periodically blocks access to Web sites like those of CNN and
The New York Times. Beijing is also upgrading China's network to
carry more data, and it has licensed more than 30 companies to
offer Internet access.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Chinese see the Internet as the savior of their economy,''
said Kenneth Farrall, a Web site designer who lives in Xiamen, in
southeastern China, and is starting an Internet consulting firm.
``My impression is that the people blocking Web sites are paying
lip service to the old guard in Beijing.''  &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Yet for all the talk about openness, Internet executives here
say the government is still drawn to the idea of creating a vast
intranet within the country. Such a network could tap the Web's
riches but remain walled off from features deemed subversive _ like
pornographic sites, postings from dissidents or anything about
Taiwan or Tibet.
</P>
<P>
   China Internet's model is tailor made for this approach. The
company, which was started in 1994, operates a proprietary news
service called China Wide Web, which has about 1,000 subscribers.
For a fee of $30 to $340 a month, depending on the level of
service, subscribers receive stock quotations and news from the New
China News Agency, Reuters, Bloomberg, the Nikkei wire service and
Agence France-Presse. But they cannot gain Web access because the
service does not have an Internet connection. By contrast, the
majority of people in China who use a dial-up service to get Web
access pay a monthly fee of roughly $68 for unlimited use, plus
access charges amounting to 50 cents an hour.
</P>
<P>
   Yip said his long-term goal was to turn the China Wide Web into
a Chinese version of the World Wide Web, a vast consumer
marketplace with Chinese-language information and entertainment. He
said the lack of such content was the biggest hurdle to Internet
growth here.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're in New York and you get on the Web, and everything
coming at you is in Arabic, you're not going to stay on all that
long,'' said Yip, who lived in the United States for 20 years and
speaks rapid-fire English.
</P>
<P>
   Another analogy for the China Wide Web may be America Online, a
subscription-based service that organizes material in a form more
digestible than on the Internet. Not surprisingly, China Internet
has a partnership with America Online, in which the companies are
developing a Hong Kong version of America Online service.
</P>
<P>
   Yip's competitors point out that America Online has a link to
the World Wide Web, while the China Wide Web does not _ which keeps
the Internet's less acceptable material out of the country. ``The
China Wide Web is an attempt to create a Web that is isolated from
the Net,'' Clark of BD Associates said. ``We're kind of past that
already.''
</P>
<P>
   Yip acknowledged that the China Wide Web's lack of an Internet
connection was a weakness. But he said it was for financial, not
political, reasons: the dominant phone company, China Telecom, had
set access fees too high. Unless the government broke up China
Telecom's virtual phone monopoly, it would make no sense to offer
Internet access.
</P>
<P>
   China Internet's close ties to the New China News Agency mean
other restrictions. The agency has several editors in the company's
offices who sift through dispatches from the Western services and
pull any that run afoul of laws barring the distribution of
political news about Taiwan or Tibet. ``We're relying on Xinhua to
interpret Chinese law and ensure that we don't stray,'' Yip said,
using the press agency's Chinese name.
</P>
<P>
   So far, China Internet has skirted trouble by sticking to less
controversial business and financial news. Its other products
include inoffensive features like a Chinese-language site about the
World Cup and one about film star Bruce Lee. But Yip said that
merely by distributing Western news, China Internet was doing its
part to open the country.
</P>
<P>
   Yip, who started and sold several technology companies in the
United States before returning to his native Hong Kong in 1989,
said the industry's hostility reflected envy at his success in
attracting partners and frustration that most companies are still
losing money on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, by most yardsticks China Internet would not seem that
big a threat. It has fewer subscribers than many of China's
struggling Internet-access providers. It has less than $10 million
in revenue and is losing money, although Yip said he expected
annual revenue to exceed $25 million in 12 months. And a
much-publicized joint venture with Pointcast, the leading purveyor
of ``push'' technology on the Internet, fell apart because of
financial disagreements.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Yip has raised $25 million from investors, and he has
turned China Internet into the first stop for technology companies
seeking to capitalize on Internet growth.
</P>
<P>
   Some rivals said China Internet represented the triumph of
salesmanship over substance. ``It's like a Hong Kong-style
newspaper,'' said Edward Zeng, chief executive of Unicom-Sparkice,
another Internet venture backed by China Unicom. ``It's different
than a Western-style newspaper. There's more promotion.''
</P>
<P>
   Yip said he was wounded by the criticism. He said he had sought
to build bridges to the younger entrepreneurs, even introducing
some to executives or venture capitalists in the United States. ``I
don't want to be perceived as Big Brother, trying to control the
Internet,'' he said with a sigh.

MASTERPIECES, OR ART BY MASTERS OF DECEPTION? 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass., Conn., Mich., Pa., Calif., Ill., France, Austria,
Netherlands, Canada)  (lb) 
 By JUDITH H. DOBRZYNSKI   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Fake!
</P>
<P>
   Is there another word that can cause such a tizzy in the art
world, especially when applied to one of van Gogh's iconic
``Sunflowers,'' for which a Japanese company paid $40 million in
1987, a record at the time?
</P>
<P>
   Is there another art-world subject that can so capture the
attention even of philistines (aside, perhaps, from thievery)?
</P>
<P>
   ``People love to hear that someone spent a lot of money for
something that's a fake,'' said Michael Findlay, a senior paintings
expert at Christie's, which sold that ``Sunflowers'' to the
Japanese and stands by it.
</P>
<P>
   For more than a year, art historians have been arguing over the
authenticity of ``Sunflowers'' and, less vehemently, over dozens of
other van Gogh paintings.
</P>
<P>
   Some experts contend that fake van Goghs include such works as
``L'Arlesienne'' at the Metropolitan Museum of Art; ``Portrait of
Dr. Gachet'' at the Musee d'Orsay in Paris; ``Three Pairs of
Shoes'' at the Fogg Art Museum at Harvard University, and paintings
in the Wadsworth Atheneum in Hartford, Conn., the Detroit Institute
of Arts, the Kunsthistorisches Museum in Vienna, Austria, and even
the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam, the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
   Now, although an article published in March in a a British art
journal, has quelled, but not completely dispelled, the questions
about ``Sunflowers,'' the issue of the authenticity of many van
Gogh works is moving into a new stage, out of scholarly journals
and into the public arena.
</P>
<P>
   Some museums have taken questioned paintings down from their
walls for further study, hoping to determine if the distinctive
brush strokes that legions of van Gogh fans can recognize at 50
paces were really painted by the artist. And some, seeing
blockbusters in the disputed swirls of paint, are organizing
exhibitions around the controversy or counting on it to add sizzle
to shows with a broader rationale.
</P>
<P>
   The Orsay and the Metropolitan have lighted on a show centered
on Dr. Paul Ferdinand Gachet, the homeopathic physician who cared
for van Gogh in his final two months and whose famous portrait sold
for even more than ``Sunflowers'' _ $82.5 million, the world
auction record for a work of art _ in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   That painting, bought by a Japanese businessman, now deceased,
has not been questioned, but doubters have fingered the almost
identical ``Portrait of Dr. Gachet'' given to the Orsay by the
Gachet family.
</P>
<P>
   Gachet was not only a pioneering collector, whose many Cezannes,
Pissarros and other impressionist paintings were donated to France,
but also a painter who copied the work of his famous impressionist
friends, signing them ``Paul van Ryssel.''
</P>
<P>
   The show, which is scheduled to open in Paris in January and
move to New York in the spring, is still being organized, but
besides Gachet's work it will display his collection of paintings,
most likely including the eight van Goghs he owned. And it may
unite the questioned and unquestioned Gachet portraits.
</P>
<P>
   Questions of Fakery Spark Interest
</P>
<P>
   For 2000-2001, the Philadelphia Museum of Art, the Museum of
Fine Arts in Boston and the Detroit Institute of Art are organizing
a show of van Gogh portraits beyond Gachet. ``I'm not steering
clear of works that have been questioned,'' said Joseph Rishel,
curator of European paintings at the Philadelphia museum. ``I'm all
for sticking my neck out. It will get more people.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, opening at the Art Institute of Chicago in September 2001,
comes ``Van Gogh and Gauguin: The Studio of the South,'' a joint
effort with the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam. It will examine the
complex relationship between the men, who wanted to start an
artists' colony to reinvigorate art in France and chose the
sunflower as its symbol. That spawned part of the problem. Gauguin
had so admired van Gogh's early sunflower paintings that van Gogh
not only painted more versions but copied some of them.
</P>
<P>
   If the organizers' wishes come true, this exhibit will unite
five ``Sunflowers'' for comparison (there were 12 or 13 in all),
including the one that Yasuda Fire and Marine Insurance of Japan
spent so much money on, as well as other works, like
``L'Arlesienne,'' that exist in many versions. (Yasuda has not yet
agreed to send its painting.)
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll understand both artists better if we understand the
context in which the paintings were made,'' said Douglas Druick,
the curator of European paintings at the Art Institute of Chicago,
``and the exhibition will address the question of `Are they by van
Gogh or are they not?'''
</P>
<P>
   (Beginning in October, the National Gallery of Art in Washington
and the Los Angeles County Museum of Art will exhibit 70 van Goghs
from the museum in Amsterdam, which will be closed for renovation.
But these masterworks, drawn from the artist's family, are not
considered dubious.)
</P>
<P>
   Questions about van Gogh's works, while perhaps new to the
public, have seethed, on and off, for at least 70 years. By most
accounts, he died a failure, having sold just one painting, or at
best a handful. But within a decade, his work grew very popular,
inviting both high prices and imitators.
</P>
<P>
   The myth of van Gogh as a mad artist, who did 76 paintings in
the 70 days before he shot himself on July 27, 1890, helped fuel
doubts about his works. What human could have done so much?
</P>
<P>
   ``Van Gogh has three catalogues raisonnes,'' noted Rishel of the
Philadelphia museum. ``What does that say?''
</P>
<P>
   As early as the 1920s, a German art dealer named Otto Wacker was
sent to prison as a fake-monger.
</P>
<P>
   A Long Debate Renewed by Scholars
</P>
<P>
   This time, the controversy flared after the 1996 publication of
Jan Hulsker's ``The New Complete Van Gogh: Paintings, Drawings,
Sketches'' (J.M. Meulenhoff, Amsterdam), an update of his 1977 van
Gogh catalogue raisonne. In it, Hulsker, the dean of van Gogh
scholars, put question marks next to 45 works, but did not explain
what they meant.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Roland Dorn, a German art historian, and Walter
Feilchenfelt, a Swiss dealer and scholar, were questioning a
different but overlapping selection of some two dozen works in van
Gogh's oeuvre. Amateur French and Italian experts also chimed in
with their lists of fakes.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, The Art Newspaper, a London-based monthly, pulled
together all the strands in a huge article that counted more than
100 suspected fakes. Among the suspected forgers are Wacker, the
art dealer; Claude-Emile Schuffenecker, a failed artist and
neighbor of van Gogh who later owned many of his works and restored
at least one version of ``Sunflowers,'' and Gachet.
</P>
<P>
   The Art Newspaper article created an uproar and set off a spate
of media coverage, including a British television documentary last
October focusing on Yasuda's ``Sunflowers.'' It tagged
Schuffenecker as the villain who had the ability, the motive and
the opportunity, because he was hired around 1900 to restore the
``Sunflowers'' now at the National Gallery in London.

<P>
   Researchers Rely on Detailed Letters
</P>
<P>
   Much of the controversy stems from a peculiarity in van Gogh
scholarship, which has both pluses and minuses. It involves a
dependence on his frequent letters to his brother, Theo, in which
Vincent described his paintings in detail. ``No other artist has
such an anchor,'' said Susan Alyson Stein, a van Gogh expert at the
Metropolitan Museum.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the letters provided a guide for forgers and
created suspicion about any painting not mentioned, perhaps
unnecessarily. ``It's wrongheaded to assume that van Gogh described
everything in his letters,'' Ms. Stein said. Besides, Druick said,
many letters are missing.
</P>
<P>
   The problems are compounded because van Gogh's death was
followed shortly by the death of Theo, who was Vincent's dealer,
leaving the van Gogh estate in the hands of Theo's widow, Johanna,
and her brother. Nonexperts, they created van Gogh's market but
lost control of it as his works grew increasingly desirable. Early
provenance records simply do not exist for many works.
</P>
<P>
   Yasuda's ``Sunflowers'' is one of three paintings depicting 14
sunflowers in a vase. Only two are cited in the letters, one now
hanging in the National Gallery in London, the other in the Van
Gogh Museum. The third, Yasuda's, surfaced in 1901, owned by
Schuffenecker, at a Paris exhibition.
</P>
<P>
   But in the March article, Bogomila Welsh-Ovcharov, a widely
published van Gogh scholar at the University of Toronto, undermined
the naysayers with an article that traced the provenance of the
Yasuda ``Sunflowers'' from van Gogh.
</P>
<P>
   She found evidence in two letters. In 1894, the widow of Pere
Tanguy, a paint merchant with whom van Gogh had left the work for
storage or possible sale, wrote about it to Johanna. Within days of
that letter, Schuffenecker wrote to Johanna thanking her for
agreeing to sell him ``Sunflowers,'' which he had picked up at
Madame Tanguy's.
</P>
<P>
   ``She has put out a lot of fires,'' Rishel said. ``No one
refutes her argument as made.'' Druick, of the Art Institute of
Chicago, agreed, but noted that some experts continue to disagree
with Ms. Welsh-Ovcharov's interpretation of the letters.
</P>
<P>
   And that is where the matter stands. Even after a daylong van
Gogh symposium in May sponsored by the Van Gogh Museum and the
National Gallery in London, ``no consensus was reached,'' the
organizers said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps oddly, auction houses and dealers say that the
controversy has had little effect on the van Gogh market. People
are still buying the few works that have been available and, said
Findlay. ``We haven't yet told a client, `I am sorry, we cannot
offer your picture because it's not accepted in some catalogue
raisonne,''' he said. ``If anyone has a work that has been doubted,
they probably wouldn't bring it forward.''
</P>
<P>
   The Van Gogh Museum has said it would compile a new catalogue
raisonne, though that will take years. It and the Art Institute of
Chicago are also undertaking an X-ray and technical analysis of the
canvas, pigments and preparatory coatings of many works.
</P>
<P>
   They are focusing on those that van Gogh painted in his final
two months in Arles, as well as a sampling of the ``Sunflowers''
paintings, ``L'Arlesiennes,'' the paintings of his bedroom in Arles
and the portraits of Augustine Roulin (``the Berceuse'').
</P>
<P>
   ``We're hoping to come up with definitive answers'' that will be
published, Druick said.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, the exhibitions will bring many works together
so that their style can be scrutinized. And the art world will
depend on scholars like Ms. Welsh-Ovcharov for research in the
neglected area of provenance.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's an international general feeling that we need to know
more about the history of van Gogh's art,'' Ms. Stein said. Not
just museums, but millions of people who own something with an iris
or a sunflower or a starry night probably want to know.

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Clusters of showers and thunderstorms will surround a
strengthening disturbance over the northern Plains. The disturbance
will move very slowly to the southeast Monday and Tuesday,
heightening the risk of local flooding across parts of the Missouri
and central Mississippi Valley.
</P>
<P>
   The day will begin dry over most of the Great Lakes and Ohio
Valley. Clouds will increase in western sections as humid air from
the Plains is forced to rise over the drier air in place over the
region. Farther to the east, sunshine will be plentiful for most of
the day although humidity will begin to increase.
</P>
<P>
   Abundant sunshine and comfortable humidity will prevail again
Monday across the Northeast as high pressure remains strong over
the region. Some patchy clouds will reach northern New England as a
weak front moves south from Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Low pressure east of the Carolinas will circulate sultry
tropical air toward the coast. As a result, bands of clouds and
thundershowers will brush the coast from southern Virginia to
Florida. Meanwhile, the interior Southeast will have ample
sunshine.
</P>
<P>
   The mercury is expected to exceed 100 degrees for the 29th
consecutive day in Dallas as sunshine remains plentiful in most of
the southern Plains. A few afternoon thunderstorms will develop
from northwestern Texas to the central Plains.
</P>
<P>
   In the West, heat will spread toward the West Coast as offshore
winds develop. Most areas will be sunny, but scattered afternoon
thunderstorms will develop in the cooler air near the east slopes
of the Rockies.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Weekend Rhythm
</P>
<P>
   Around Philadelphia, the warm-season weather has had a pleasing
rhythm. Since May 23, the early part of the week has been cooler
than the latter part, Fridays have been wet, and only one weekend
has been a washout. There is scientific basis for the tendency for
the weekend weather to repeat itself. The average speed and spacing
of weather systems in the middle latitudes brings a disturbance
approximately once every 3.5 days. Hence, it is not uncommon for a
pattern to evolve where the weekend weather at a given location
repeats itself for several successive weeks.

DEAL TO CREATE THE LARGEST INTERACTIVE AD AGENCY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ill., Calif., Ga.)   (10:45 p.m. ET EMBARGO for print media; 12:01 a.m. ET EMBARGO for
electronic media.)  
(lb) 
 By SAUL HANSELL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a combination that will create the largest agency devoted to
creating advertising on the Internet, Agency.com has agreed to buy
Eagle River Interactive.
</P>
<P>
   This deal, which is expected to be announced Monday, is the
latest in a mad game of Pac Man, in which the dozens of small
agencies founded by young entrepreneurs are racing to gobble one
another up.
</P>
<P>
   Behind the scenes in many of these transactions is Omnicom
Group, the huge advertising agency holding company, which has taken
stakes in several of the most prominent start-up interactive
agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Omnicom owns 40 percent of Agency.com, which is based in New
York, and all of Eagle River Interactive, based in Chicago. The
terms of the deal have not been disclosed, but Omnicom's stake in
Agency.com will increase to just under half as a result of the
deal, said Chan Suh, Agency.com's chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, Agency.com has also bought Online Magic,
Spiral Media, Ketchum Interactive and Interactive Solutions. The
last two were also owned by Omnicom.
</P>
<P>
   Interactive agencies provide a range of services, including
helping companies set up their own sites on the World Wide Web and
placing ``banner'' advertisements on other sites to bring in
traffic. While this business incorporates the sort of writing and
design skills used by conventional advertising agencies, much of
the work of the interactive shops more closely resembles the
detailed computer programming typically provided by technology
companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``An interactive company is one part creativity, one part
technology and one part business strategy,'' said Felice Kincannon,
who looks after Omnicom's interactive holdings through a unit
called Communicade.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, technology companies have been expanding into this
field. Both IBM and Electronic Data Services Corp. have set up big
interactive design departments as an adjunct to their business of
building elaborate Internet sites for companies.
</P>
<P>
   And two of the most aggressive acquirers of interactive agencies
_ U S Web in Santa Clara, Calif., and iXL in Atlanta _ have been
buying both technology and design companies.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the conventional advertising companies have the greatest
ties to the existing interactive agencies, with True North
Communications, Grey Advertising and Interpublic Group all owning
stakes in at least one of the top 15 agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Omnicom, however, has been the most aggressive, with stakes in
four of the top 15 ranked by Adweek magazine, including Agency.com,
now tied with iXL for first place; Think New Ideas, the
fifth-ranked agency; Organic Online, No. 7, and Eagle River, No.
14. In total, its six agencies have 1,500 employees and revenues of
$180 million. That represents about one-third of what Jupiter
Communications estimates is a $500 million market this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead of picking one horse to ride, Omnicom has spread its
bets and has watched how the race turned out,'' said Seth Alpert, a
senior adviser to Ad Media Partners, a New York investment bank
that specializes in media companies. ``So far, they have done a
pretty good job.
</P>
<P>
   As it has with conventional advertising agencies, Omnicom has
been able to buy into the younger interactive agencies by offering
to act as the friendly, but unintrusive, big brother.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are not backseat drivers,'' Suh said, adding that
Agency.com had few client referrals from other Omnicom agencies.
But it has been able to ask executives of the holding company
questions from time to time.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like having your own consulting company on call,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Omnicom has subtly encouraged the strongest of its flock to
absorb the laggards. In February it flew the top executives of all
of its interactive companies to a retreat in Miami. While Omnicom
did not play explicit matchmaker, the flirtation was as heavy as on
a college spring break.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a courting thing,'' said Kevin Rowe, the chief
executive of Eagle River. After a first date of a joint project for
Compaq Computer, Eagle River and Agency.com decided to get hitched.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of the combination, Agency.com, which was founded in
1995, will have 575 employees in 10 offices and 1998 revenues of
about $80 million. Agency.com's largest clients include British
Airways, GTE and Metropolitan Life. Eagle River, a descendant of a
company that placed billboards on Colorado ski slopes, serves
clients that include Sprint and Disneyland Paris.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Many advertising-industry executives believe Agency.com is
trying to grow quickly in preparation for an initial public
offering. Suh declined to comment on any potential offering.
</P>
<P>
   Others wonder whether many of these young companies are
expanding faster than they can handle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get worried for a company like Agency.com,'' said Gene
DeRose, the president of Jupiter Communications. ``I think they
have to be careful about how they integrate their acquisitions.''
</P>
<P>
   DeRose pointed to the example of CKS Group, one of the first
publicly held interactive agencies, which has found melding its
many acquisitions harder than it expected. CKS' stock trades at
less than half of its 52-week high of $64.25, reached last
September; the shares closed at $19.3125 Friday, off 12.5 cents, in
Nasdaq trading.
</P>
<P>
   Others point out that the acquisition price for interactive
agencies is vastly higher than for conventional ad agencies, which
typically are sold for about the total of their annual revenues.
</P>
<P>
   The high water mark for pricing was recently set by ICC
Technologies, a Hatboro, Pa., maker of humidity-control systems,
which recently moved onto the Internet by buying Rare Medium, a
small New York agency, for $45 million, more than 11 times its
revenues.
</P>
<P>
   Many other more traditional buyers are turning up their noses at
those prices.
</P>
<P>
   ``We recently met with a foreign agency who said they were
looking for an interactive shop in this country,'' Alpert of Ad
Media Partners said. ``We told them they would have to pay four or
five times revenue, and they were aghast and went home.''

WESTERN ENVOYS CALL BULGARIA AN ARMS BAZAAR FOR THE WORLD 
</HEADLINE>
  (jw) 
 By RAYMOND BONNER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SOFIA, Bulgaria _ Once the renowned supplier of weapons for the
Soviet Union, this Balkan country has become the arms bazaar for
rebels and terrorist organizations of every political, ethnic and
religious persuasion, Western officials and experts in the small
arms trade say.
</P>
<P>
   Secret weapons shipments have gone to rebel groups forming in
Congo, threatening another outbreak of war there; to rebels in
Angola, who are preparing to take up their war anew there, and to
Eritrea, adding to Washington's fears about the escalation of
fighting in the Horn of Africa. And that is just in the last few
months. Other arms shoppers have included Sri Lanka's Tamil Tigers,
which Washington has labeled a terrorist group, and Rwanda's Hutu
militia, who were responsible for mass killings in Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
   If the Bulgarian arms traffic were shut down or cleaned up, far
fewer weapons would end up fueling today's regional wars,
intelligence and industry experts said.
</P>
<P>
   But Washington and the European Union, while voicing concern,
have done little to stop the trade, diplomats from several nations
said.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, both Europe and the United States have put more
diplomatic muscle into getting the Bulgarian government to shut
down the production of pirate compact disks thanks to pressure from
business groups, diplomats said. By contrast, they noted, there is
no business lobby calling for a crackdown on Bulgaria's arms
makers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't regard it as a subject on which to make a fuss,'' a
Western ambassador said, slightly chagrined.
</P>
<P>
   The big attraction in Bulgaria is the Kalashnikov assault rifle.
Light, durable and easy to maintain, it is ideal for young soldiers
slogging through jungles or trekking up mountains. And Bulgaria
makes the best. Having lost their traditional Cold War markets,
Bulgaria's arms manufacturers are desperate for customers, whom
they have accommodated with false shipping documents to disguise
both the buyer and the destination of the weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Bulgaria's major arms suppliers declined to be interviewed.
Government officials denied that the country has become a major
center for illicit arms trafficking, as American and European
officials maintain.
</P>
<P>
   ``The official government policy is directed at restraining such
activities,'' said Vladimir Tourtansky, a senior official in
Bulgaria's Cabinet-level Council on Defense Industry and Logistics.
</P>
<P>
   Advocates for greater controls on small-arms trade point out
that so-called small arms and light weapons _ assault rifles,
grenades, mortars _ have caused more death and destruction in the
last 50 years than nuclear, biological and chemical weapons, which
are the objects of international alarm and controls.
</P>
<P>
   Bulgaria is not the only place where rebels and rogues shop.
Arms manufacturers in Ukraine, Slovakia, Romania and Belarus are
also major suppliers of weapons.
</P>
<P>
   But at the moment, Bulgarian arms are the weapons of choice.
</P>
<P>
   At the center of the trade are Kintex, the state marketing
agency, and Arsenal, the country's largest arms manufacturer, which
is also state-owned.
</P>
<P>
   Founded by Bulgaria's secret police in the 1960s, Kintex has a
history of dubious arms trading. During the Iran-Iraq war, the
company sold to both sides.
</P>
<P>
   Kintex ``offers so many models of Kalashnikov assault rifles''
that Jane's Infantry Weapons, the industry's authoritative guide,
feels compelled to provide a summary. Altogether, Jane's lists 16
Bulgarian models, from the AKT-47, a training version of the
original AK-47, to the AK-74, the latest version of the assault
rifle, which was designed 50 years ago by Mikhail Kalashnikov for
the Soviet Army.
</P>
<P>
   All are made by Arsenal. Bulgarian officials boast that Mikhail
Kalashnikov has said Arsenal makes the highest quality Kalashnikov
today. The company also manufactures the 9-millimeter Makarov
pistol, which is often in the crates of weapons clandestinely
shipped from here.
</P>
<P>
   Kintex and Arsenal denied several requests for interviews.
</P>
<P>
   Arsenal and Kintex, along with other Bulgarian weapons
companies, are still largely in the hands of the men who ran them
during the communist days. In doing business today, they make use
of the expertise and contacts they developed when Bulgaria handled
Moscow's clients, including Libya, Iraq and Iran, and many African
governments or guerrilla groups.
</P>
<P>
   With the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, Bulgaria lost
these secondary markets, as well as the Warsaw Pact. Struggling to
survive economically has caused the companies to engage in shady
practices, diplomats said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their attitude toward the small arms trade is: We know we
shouldn't but we can't afford not to,'' a European diplomat said.
</P>
<P>
   An Asian diplomat put it this way: ``If you can't sell to the
Soviet Union, if you can't sell to the Warsaw Pact, if you can't
sell to Iran, Iraq, Libya, what do you do?''
</P>
<P>
   ``They need capital,'' he went on. ``So I suppose they don't
look too closely at end-user certificates.'' That refers to the
document that is supposed to identify the ultimate destination of
the weapons.
</P>
<P>
   A few months ago, acting for a British mercenary army, Arsenal
shipped 35 tons of weapons for rebels in Sierre Leone, using
documents that said they were going to Nigeria. In a deal for 77
tons of Kalashnikovs and other weapons, air-dropped to a violent
religious sect in India two years ago, Arsenal used phony documents
saying they were going to the Bangladesh Defense Ministry.
</P>
<P>
   Western and Asian diplomats said that the current Bulgarian
government, which came to power last year, was trying more than
previous post-communist governments to curb shady arms practices,
but that it was constrained by the country's economic needs and the
influence of the military industry.
</P>
<P>
   Tourtansky said he was not aware of any arms company that has
been punished for using false documents. He added, however, that
Bulgaria's arms sales policies ``are in line with all international
standards and norms.'' He stressed that Bulgaria was complying with
the so-called Wassenaar Arrangement.
</P>
<P>
   Pushed by the Clinton administration, the Wassenaar accord _
named after the Dutch city where it was signed three years ago _ is
aimed at controlling exports of conventional weapons and dual-use
goods, like computers and telecommunications equipment, to
countries like Iran, Iraq, Libya and North Korea.
</P>
<P>
   But Wassenaar, with 33 member-nations, does not deal with
illicit trade and does not require reporting sales of Kalashnikovs
and other small arms, American officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The most comprehensive report on arms sales is published
annually by the United Nations. But it covers only heavy weapons,
like tanks and warships. Assault rifles, mortars, rocket launchers
and other light weapons are not included.
</P>
<P>
   International policies like these allow Tourtansky to say
accurately, ``We are not required to report to anyone about our
international sales.''

POSSIBLE MANIPULATION OF CRIME DATA WORRIES TOP POLICE

 By FOX BUTTERFIELD   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ Senior police officials around the nation are
concerned that the sharp drop in crime in recent years has produced
new pressure on police departments to show ever-decreasing crime
statistics and might be behind incidents in several cities in which
commanders have manipulated crime data.
</P>
<P>
   So far this year, there have been charges of falsely reporting
crime statistics here, in New York, Atlanta and Boca Raton, Fla.,
resulting in the resignation or demotion of high-ranking police
commanders.
</P>
<P>
   In Boca Raton, for example, a police captain, with the knowledge
of the police chief, systematically downgraded property crimes like
burglaries to vandalism, trespassing or missing property, reducing
the city's felony rate by almost 11 percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Experts say they believe these incidents do not mean that the
nationwide drop in crime since 1992 is illusory. But they are
beginning to question whether politicians seeking office, the news
media and the public should attach so much importance to the
annual, and sometimes monthly, release of the latest crime figures.
</P>
<P>
   In Philadelphia, the city has had to withdraw its crime figures
from the national system maintained by the FBI for 1996, 1997 and
for at least the first half of 1998 because of underreporting and
downgrading serious crimes into less serious incidents and
sloppiness.
</P>
<P>
   Because of Philadelphia's size _ it accounts for 2 percent of
all slayings in the United States _ the removal of its numbers
could skew the crime rate for the whole nation. But Harlan McEwan,
a deputy assistant director of the FBI, said he was confident the
agency had statistical methods to adjust the national rate even
without Philadelphia's figures. The 1997 crime figures will be
published this fall.
</P>
<P>
   The impact on Philadelphia will be more telling. ``I can
guarantee you my crime is going to be way up this year,'' said John
Timoney, who took over as Philadelphia's police commissioner in
March. ``But I don't care. If we are going to get this right and
reduce crime, we have to start with accurate statistics.''
</P>
<P>
   Gil Kerlikowske, the former police commissioner of Buffalo,
N.Y., said the pressure on police departments to prove their
performance through reduced crime figures, with promotions and pay
raises increasingly dependent on good data, ``creates a new area
for police corruption and ethics,'' along with the traditional
problems of brutality and payoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Kerlikowske suggested that there had been too much focus on the
eight major crimes counted by the bureau in its crime index: the
violent crimes of murder, rape, robbery and aggravated assault
along with the property crimes of burglary, theft, stolen cars and
arson.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is too little focus on lesser crimes, which are not
counted by the FBI,'' Kerlikowske said, ``like drug sales,
prostitution and graffiti, which are more meaningful to the overall
quality of life because there is so much more of them.''
</P>
<P>
   A common thread running through many of the incidences of police
officials altering crime statistics has been that police commanders
have downgraded felonies like aggravated assault and burglary,
which are reported to the FBI, to misdemeanors like vandalism that
are not reported to the bureau. As less serious crimes, they do not
show up on a city's crime reports published by the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   One of the first acts by Timoney, who was a career police
officer in New York, where he helped pioneer the city's highly
regarded computerized crime statistics system, was to set up a
quality assurance division. It soon discovered that serious crimes
throughout Philadelphia were being underreported by about 8
percent, he said in an interview. Much of this was the result of
``stupidity or carelessness and was not intentional,'' Timoney
said.
</P>
<P>
   But Timoney discovered earlier this month that the youngest
district commander in the city, Capt. Daniel Castro, who had an
excellent reputation for introducing community policing and
aggressively eliminating drug dealers from the streets of West
Philadelphia, had greatly exaggerated his reports of crime
reduction.
</P>
<P>
   Castro reported an 80 percent drop in serious crime in his
district over the past year. But a review found that Castro had
downgraded many robberies, burglaries and thefts to cases of
``missing property.'' Castro was removed from his command.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, Kenneth Donohue, the head of the police
department's transportation bureau, was forced to resign earlier
this year after Police Commissioner Howard Safir said he had
presided over an elaborate scheme to reclassify incidents on the
subway as street crimes. Safir said the manipulation had gone on
for years and had underestimated crime in the subways by about 20
percent, but it had not affected New York City's overall crime rate
because the crimes had been shifted to to the streets and were
reported by the regular police precincts.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, police officers here and in many other cities
across the country had not attached much importance to collecting
crime statistics beyond the need to report them to the FBI, Timoney
said, and most commanders were more interested in issues like
narcotics, training or forestalling corruption.
</P>
<P>
   This casual attitude toward statistics, Timoney said, also
stemmed from a ``belief by the average police chief, in their heart
of hearts, that they couldn't do anything about crime because they
couldn't affect the root causes of crime.'' This was an idea that
had been popularized by academic criminologists in the 1970s and
1980s.
</P>
<P>
   The success of New York in significantly reducing crime, along
with similar successes in cities from Boston to Houston, changed
that old-fashioned mindset, Timoney said. Statistics have now
become as important a tool to the police as good accounting is to
corporate executives.

</P>
<P>
   But the change to placing a premium on keeping accurate
statistics in a big police department is not easy. For years,
Philadelphia police counted crimes not when they occurred, but when
officers logged them into their records, sometimes months later,
meaning that some crimes that took place in one year were not
reported to the FBI until the next year, throwing off the national
crime rate.
</P>
<P>
   In Boca Raton, tips from low-level police officers led to an
investigation by the Palm Beach County state attorney's office last
month that found that Capt. Jim Duke had systematically downgraded
felonies, mostly property crimes, to misdemeanors ``for the direct
purpose of not having to report these crimes'' to the FBI. In 1997,
Duke, who was later forced to resign, downgraded 385 felonies, 11
percent of the city's total of 3,635 serious crimes.
</P>
<P>
   In most of the cases, Duke personally reclassified the crimes by
writing supplemental reports claiming new information showed that
they were not as serious as originally recorded, according to the
prosecutor's report. In one instance, Duke downgraded a home
burglary to vandalism, though it had occurred while the residents
slept at 1 a.m. and someone broke in through a kitchen window and
stole a purse.
</P>
<P>
   In another incident originally labeled a burglary, a thief stole
$5,000 in jewelry and did more than $25,000 in damage, the
prosecutor said, but Duke also reclassified the case as vandalism.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutor's office found that the ``prevailing philosophy''
at the Boca Raton Police Department regarding report
classifications, from at least the level of Duke down to the
officer on the beat, was that the reports ``should be classified at
the lowest level possible.''
</P>
<P>
   The city's police chief, Peter Petracco, initially denied
knowing about the changes, but was also forced to resign after it
was discovered he had lied, said the city manager, Donna Dreska.
</P>
<P>
   Debra Shannon, a spokeswoman for the Boca Raton Police
Department, said the motives of the two in manipulating the crime
report were still unknown. The prosecutor's investigation said the
two had no criminal intent. An internal city police investigation
is continuing.
</P>
<P>
   In Atlanta, the City Council and the Georgia Bureau of
Investigation are investigating accusations by a deputy police
chief, Louis Arcangeli, that two other deputy chiefs pressured
detectives and officers to write off unsolved crimes and
misclassify violent crimes as nonviolent when preparing the city's
crime statistics for 1996, the year the Olympics took place there.
In a series of memorandums to Police Chief Beverly Harvard of
Atlanta, Arcangeli warned that the number of crimes reported as
``unfounded,'' or without basis after an investigation, jumped 78
percent from 1995 to 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Harvard demoted Arcangeli to captain after he wrote the
memorandums, which were leaked to journalists, though she has
insisted his demotion had nothing to do with the dispute.
</P>
<P>
   Arcangeli's lawyer, Bill McKenney, said the Atlanta Police
Department's crime reporting procedure created ample room for the
problem. Unless a crime is serious, like murder or rape, McKenney
said, detectives do not investigate it in person but instead send
postcards to the victims.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the crimes in question involved the transient poor or
homeless people who did not return the postcards, McKenney said, so
police reported their claims were groundless.
</P>
<P>
   Alfred Blumstein, a criminologist at Carnegie Mellon University,
said one reason to continue to have confidence in overall national
crime figures reported by police to the FBI is that the downward
trend reported had been mirrored by the country's other statistical
program to measure crime, the National Crime Victimization Survey.
Begun in 1973 as a check on the FBI data, it measures crimes by a
survey of 49,000 households.
</P>
<P>
   The danger of sloppy reporting by police, or outright fraud, is
the reason most criminologists focus on murders as the most
accurate crime statistic, Blumstein said. It is hard to hide
bodies.

   MONTEZUMA CREEK, Utah _ A century ago, Pinkerton detectives and
bounty hunters rode on horseback through the red-rock canyons and
mesas of southeast Utah, trying to track down two outlaws, Butch
Cassidy and the Sundance Kid.
</P>
<P>
   This summer, as many as 500 law officers have been searching the
same mesas and canyons for two men suspected of killing a police
officer and wounding three sheriffs. Searchers have used infrared
cameras, night-vision scopes, motion detectors, radios with
encrypted transmissions, smoke bombs, armored personnel carriers,
four-wheel-drive vehicles, airplanes and helicopters.
</P>
<P>
   While today's wanted posters offering a $327,000 bounty are
broadcast on television, the searchers are finding themselves just
as empty-handed as the Pinkertons in territorial days, when posters
for the two outlaws and their Hole in the Wall gang were circulated
by hand.
</P>
<P>
   On May 29, the fugitives vanished into this vast no man's land
known as the Four Corners, where the boundaries of Colorado, Utah,
Arizona and New Mexico meet. Two months later, the authorities do
not know whether the pair are dead, in hiding or enjoying life in
Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you know the territory, you can survive,'' said Duane
Smith, a western history professor at Fort Lewis College in
Durango, Colo. ``Butch Cassidy, and now these guys, knew how to
keep one step ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   The manhunt centers on San Juan County, Utah, a jurisdiction
that includes part of the Navajo reservation, as well as 5,600
square miles of uninhabited public land, an area larger than
Connecticut. A mythic outlaw landscape to generations of Americans,
this country of canyons, pinyons and Indian ruins has served as a
Western backdrop for Zane Grey's 1912 novel ``Riders of the Purple
Sage'' and for the 1990 film ``Thelma and Louise.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not making any statements to glamorize these two,''
Leonard Butler, chief of police for the Navajo Nation, said of the
wanted men, Alan Pilon, 30, and Jason McVean, 26. ``They are cop
killers. They have wounded deputies.''
</P>
<P>
   The police say that around noon on May 28, Pilon, of Dove Creek,
Colo., and McVean, of Durango, Colo., walked into an oil-service
company in Ignacio, Colo., about 100 miles east of here, and stole
an empty water truck.
</P>
<P>
   The next morning, Dale Claxton, a Cortez, Colo., police officer,
spotted the missing truck about 50 miles west of Ignacio, by which
time a friend of the two men, Robert Mason of Durango, had joined
them, according to police affidavits. As the truck stopped at a
bridge, Claxton pulled up behind it. As he sat in his police car,
with his seat belt still fastened, a passenger jumped out of the
truck and fired 29 bullets into the car, killing Claxton. Fifteen
minutes later, the affidavits say, the men in the water truck stole
a flatbed truck from a construction worker and posted one man with
an automatic rifle in the back.
</P>
<P>
   Jason Bishop, a Montezuma County deputy sheriff, remembers
looking in his rear-view window to see the truck roaring up behind
him. A man in camouflage appeared over the cab and sprayed his
police car with automatic weapon fire, Bishop said. Shot in the
head, the officer lost consciousness and his car veered off the
road and rammed a shed.
</P>
<P>
   In the next few minutes, the affidavits say, passengers in the
stolen truck fired as many as 500 bullets at several police cars
that had joined the chase.
</P>
<P>
   ``They just lit the whole car up with gunfire,'' Todd Martin, a
sheriff's deputy who was wounded, said later. ``The sound was
deafening. I saw my shoulder and elbow and forearm explode.''
</P>
<P>
   Driving farther west into Utah, the fugitives encountered Art
Hutchinson, superintendent of Hovenweep National Monument, trying
to block access to the park with his car. The fugitives riddled his
car with bullets, swerved around it, and entered the park.
Hutchinson, who took cover in a ditch, was not hit. After driving
across the park, the fugitives parked the truck at the head of a
canyon and disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   A week later, the authorities say Mason apparently fired on a
Utah state welfare worker along the San Juan River near here, and
then on a San Juan County sheriff's deputy, wounding him in the
shoulder and the chest. Minutes later, searchers found Mason's
body. According to an autopsy, Mason had placed a pistol in his
mouth and pulled the trigger.
</P>
<P>
   Officers have interviewed hundreds of people to prepare profiles
of the two remaining fugitives. Both are described as men who mix
an intimate knowledge of the desert region with a hatred of the
government and a conviction that society will break down with the
end of the millennium.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Pilon, a third-generation resident of the area, became outraged
at the government over a conviction last year for drunken driving
that led to revocation of his driver's license and over a recent
Internal Revenue Service bill for $1,400 in back taxes. As a boy,
he often accompanied his father for weekend trips into the canyons
of San Juan County, prospecting for uranium.
</P>
<P>
   McVean, a bricklayer, had also camped extensively in the area,
often hunting for ancient Indian pots and arrowheads. A former
employer of McVean said he sometimes spent most of his paycheck on
ammunition, buying bullets by the 1,000-round case. McVean told
friends that society would fall apart at the turn of the century,
that gold and money would become valueless and bullets would emerge
as a currency of exchange. He tied society's collapse partly to the
potential computer problem in the year 2000, when computers might
not recognize the beginning of a new century.
</P>
<P>
   Police detectives say they had linked shell casings from an
automatic weapon owned by McVean to the gun used to kill Claxton.
</P>
<P>
   According to police affidavits, the three men had stored large
amounts of food, clothing and guns in various places ``in
preparation for the end of the world, which will be in the year
2000.''
</P>
<P>
   On June 28, a 9-year-old Navajo girl encountered two white men
in camouflage who were looking over her father's water truck here.
They walked away, and the Navajo police matched the footprints to
the two fugitives.
</P>
<P>
   What the men had planned to do with a water truck remains a
mystery, though the authorities have a theory. They speculate that
McVean, a known admirer of Timothy McVeigh, may have planned to
pack a water truck with diesel fuel and ammonium nitrate
fertilizer, creating a truck bomb similar to the one that McVeigh
used to level the federal building in Oklahoma City.
</P>
<P>
   Before the the theft of the water truck, Pilon told friends,
according to an affidavit, ``We got something planned,'' adding
that he was ``going to do something drastic.''
</P>
<P>
   With fears of more violence lending urgency to the manhunt,
legal agencies have spent an estimated $1.5 million so far in the
search for the two men. With daytime temperatures reaching 106
degrees in midsummer, infrared heat-seeking devices are useless,
bloodhounds can not track because of the heat and several
law-enforcement officers have been treated for heat exhaustion.
</P>
<P>
   The noisy helicopters that have crisscrossed the dry washes and
shallow valleys advertise the locations of search parties but
cannot help searchers peer into the thousands of canyons, caves,
crevices and mine shafts that perforate the area.
</P>
<P>
   With 51 agencies collaborating, the search has suffered from
inter-agency rivalry. Navajo police officers have questioned why,
in the early weeks, they were assigned to man traffic checkpoints,
while an FBI team from Los Angeles tried to search canyons. But
early in July the Navajo police took over the investigation, as
much of the area, including this community, is on the Navajo
reservation. On different days, the trackers said they had heard
the fugitives cough, startle livestock and run across a clearing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We located them, we chased them, but unfortunately we weren't
able to apprehend them,'' said Butler, adding that he forbids his
men to shoot on sight for fear of harming innocent hikers.
</P>
<P>
   Without any concrete progress, the search has been scaled back
to a few teams. On July 18, the people of Cortez renamed the city's
police station after their slain police officer and held a ``thank
you'' barbecue for the searchers.
</P>
<P>
   ``All three of those evil cowards are in a hole of one kind or
another,'' said Paul Alstrom, Colorado state director of public
safety.
</P>
<P>
   But in canyon country, the right hole is hard to find.

`OPEN MINDED': DISTURBING SIGNS BEHIND REPORTS OF FREUD'S DEMISE 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Publication notes at end of review.)  
(lb) 
 By CHRISTOPHER LEHMANN-HAUPT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Jonathan Lear was a child, grown-ups would often ask him,
``Are you related to the king?'' As he explains in the preface to
his stimulating new collection of essays on psychoanalysis and
philosophy, ``Open Minded: Working Out the Logic of the Soul,'' he
came to take the question for granted, not even bothering to learn
to whom the questioners were referring.
</P>
<P>
   But when he became older and read ``King Lear,'' he found it
difficult to identify with someone so insecure and vain. And then
one night, during the time he was in analysis, he woke up with a
start and realized that he was related to the king. He was
Cordelia, because he always wanted to be blunt in his appraisals
and at the same time to be loved for it.
</P>
<P>
   In writing the present book, he wanted to say that ``there is
something dead'' in the professions of psychoanalysis and
philosophy, ``and I wanted to be loved for saying so.'' He
concludes, ``This book is above all a response to a sense of
deadness: it is an attempt to bring some life into two activities
which lie at the heart of our humanity.''
</P>
<P>
   At the core of his response is a defense of psychoanalysis
against the rising tide of Freud bashers that has lately battered
the profession. (This chapter, ``On Killing Freud (Again),''
appeared in a recent issue of The New Republic and prompted the
writer Janet Malcolm in a dust-jacket endorsement of the present
book to make the surprising claim that ``since his essay appeared,
talk about `the death of psychoanalysis' has noticeably
subsided.'')
</P>
<P>
   In the chapter, Lear, who teaches at the University of Chicago,
blames Jeffrey M. Masson and Frederick Crews for willfully
misreading the evolution of Freud's theories of childhood
seduction. What Freud actually abandoned later in his career, Lear
writes, ``was blind faith in the idea that alleged memories of
abuse are always and everywhere what they purport to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Lear continues: ``In realizing that one could not take all
memory claims at face value, Freud effectively discovered that the
mind is active and imaginative in the organization of its own
experience. This is one of the crucial moments in the founding of
psychoanalysis.''
</P>
<P>
   In the same essay, Lear also disputes those who insist that
psychoanalysis can't prove ``the cause-and-effect connections it
claims between unconscious motivation and its visible
manifestations in ordinary life and in a clinical setting,'' a
major theme in one of his previous books, ``Love and Its Place in
Nature: A Philosophical Interpretation of Freudian
Psychoanalysis.'' To deny such connections, he argues, is
tantamount to denying that people are sometimes driven by
unconscious motives and behave irrationally.
</P>
<P>
   This relates to what he says is really the object of the attacks
on Freud, namely ``the very idea that humans have unconscious
motivation,'' that what ails us may lie beyond the reach of
psychopharmacology and neuropsychiatry (for all they have
contributed) and that we are capable of meaning more than we say.
</P>
<P>
   Our capacity to mean more than we say is the common thread of
all the essays here, which explore philosophically the phenomenon
of transference in psychotherapy, the nature of the unconscious
mind and the role of Eros in Freud's thinking.
</P>
<P>
   In the chapter ``Knowingness and Abandonment: An Oedipus for Our
Time,'' Lear reinterprets Sophocles' ``Oedipus Tyrannus,'' pointing
out that while Oedipus murdered his father and slept with his
mother, he did not do so because of the complex Freud named after
him.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Lear argues, Oedipus' flaw was to have understood the
Delphic oracle too easily, to have assumed that ``meaning is
transparent to human reason'' and to have ignored ``unconscious
meaning.''
</P>
<P>
   He ``displays a `knowingness' eerily reminiscent of contemporary
culture's demand to already know,'' Lear concludes. ``But there is
a sickness in this `knowingness': reason is being used to jump
ahead to a conclusion, as though there is too much anxiety involved
in simply asking a question and waiting for the world to answer.''
</P>
<P>
   Lear offers similarly astute and original readings of
Aristotle's ``Poetics,'' Plato's ``Symposium'' and ``Republic'' and
Wittgenstein's ``Philosophical Investigations.'' He feels free to
range so widely because he sees the work of these writers as
related; each in his own way was ``working out the logic of the
soul.'' Each knew ``that one of the most important truths about us
is that we have the capacity to be open minded: the capacity to
live nondefensively with the question of how to live.''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, a third of these essays plunge so deeply into
philosophical and psychoanalytic arcana that even a patient reader
is likely to feel taxed, at least in places. But the critical
essays will prove of value to anyone seriously engaged by
literature. And the chapters on Freud and Oedipus are worth the
price of admission alone.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the Freud chapter, Lear makes the point that
``obsessing about Freud the man is a way of keeping Freud the
meaning at bay.'' He continues, ``The many attacks on him, even
upon psychoanalysis, refuse to recognize that Freud gave birth to a
psychoanalytic movement which in myriad ways has moved beyond
him.''
</P>
<P>
   Lear concludes: ``Just as democracy requires the recognition
that the king is dead, both as an individual and as an institution,
so the democratic recognition that each person is a maker of
unconscious, symbolic meanings requires the acceptance of Freud's
death. What matters, as Freud himself well understood, is what we
are able to do with the meanings we make.''
</P>
<P>
   The best of these essays prompt us to examine those meanings,
which activity, as Plato famously said, is what makes life worth
living.

NBC BACKING AN ONLINE TV SERVICE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Colo., Pa.)  (js) 
 By ANDREW POLLACK   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA MONICA, Calif. _ NBC will invest in and supply programming
to a startup online service to provide movies, television programs
and music on demand to personal computers.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement could mean that viewers who miss ``Dateline'' at
night could see it the next day at times of their choosing, said
Jonathan Taplin, co-chairman of Intertainer Inc., the start-up
company.
</P>
<P>
   But by making programs available online, NBC risks angering its
affiliated local stations at a time when it is trying to reorganize
its relationship with them.
</P>
<P>
   The affiliates ``have a very legitimate interest in a certain
level of exclusivity,'' said Martin Yudkovitz, president of NBC
Interactive Media. While news programs might be available online
soon after they are broadcast, Intertainer will get entertainment
shows only from previous seasons, he said. Also, only programs
owned by NBC itself, like ``Saturday Night Live'' and ``The Tonight
Show,'' will be eligible for the online service, not shows like
``ER'' that are broadcast by NBC but owned by others.
</P>
<P>
   Under the agreement, NBC and GE Capital, both owned by General
Electric Co., will together invest about $3 million for a 6 percent
stake in privately held Intertainer. They will have options to buy
up to 19 percent at a price of about $75 million in the next 18
months, Taplin said. NBC would not confirm those figures.
</P>
<P>
   NBC affiliates might not have much to worry about. Previous
attempts to provide video on demand, like Time Warner's 500-channel
cable system in Orlando, Fla., have failed.
</P>
<P>
   And NBC's investment in Intertainer does not represent a big
bet. NBC has made small investments in numerous Internet and
interactive television companies, in hopes of being well positioned
for the future. It offers short video clips on Videoseeker, a Web
site it runs.
</P>
<P>
   Intertainer is run by Taplin and Richard Baskin, both long
experienced in Hollywood. In addition to NBC, its investors include
Comcast, a cable television operator, and Intel, Sony and US West.
Its service will be offered next month in Willow Grove, Pa., to
Comcast cable customers who order cable modems and later this year
in Denver by US West over so-called digital-subscriber telephone
lines.

THE PEOPLE BEHIND APPLE'S `THINK DIFFERENT' CAMPAIGN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN:Calif.)  (js) 
 By STUART ELLIOTT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A computer marketer wants to become the apple of your eye by
advertising itself as the Apple of your icon.
</P>
<P>
   For almost a year, Apple Computer Inc. has been displaying
images of some of the world's most-admired achievers in fields from
government and business to human rights and the arts as the
centerpiece of a campaign that ungrammatically urges consumers to
``Think different.''
</P>
<P>
   The goal of the campaign is to further polish the once-tarnished
Apple brand name, asserting that the company nurtures creativity by
behaving as unconventionally as the accomplished thinkers and doers
who are praised as ``the round pegs in the square holes'' in
television commercials, print ads, billboards, posters and wall
signs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ads are for people who don't care what the computer
does,'' said Allen Olivo, senior director for worldwide marketing
communications at Apple in Cupertino, Calif., ``but care about what
they can do with the computer.
</P>
<P>
   ``The premise is that people who use Apple computers are
different,'' he said, ``and that we make computers for those
creative people who believe that one person can change the world.''
</P>
<P>
   The celebrated strivers who make it through a nomination and
selection process at Apple and its advertising agency, the TBWA
Chiat/Day unit of TBWA Worldwide in Venice, Calif., are portrayed
in the ads as larger-than-life icons in striking black-and-white
photographs. They are presented as the kind of heroes who, a
commercial proclaims, ``push the human race forward,'' a phrase
that subtly flatters the intended audience for recognizing the
subjects.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign has so far featured more than 40 so-called crazy
ones: historic and contemporary figures who include Bob Dylan,
Einstein, Ted Turner, Picasso, John Lennon and Yoko Ono, Edison,
Muhammad Ali, Alfred Hitchcock, Miles Davis, Lucille Ball and Desi
Arnaz, the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., Amelia Earhart, Jim Henson,
Rosa Parks, Frank Lloyd Wright and Jerry Seinfeld. And more are on
the way.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not trying to say these people use Apple,'' said Lee
Clow, the chief creative officer at TBWA Worldwide, owned by
Omnicom Group, ``or that if they could've used a computer, they
would've used Apple. Instead, we're going for the emotional
celebration of creativity, which should always be part of how we
speak about the brand.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if it was overreaching to involve Einstein, Gandhi and
Picasso in pitching, Olivo replied: ``We would never associate
these people with any product; it's Apple celebrating them versus
Apple using them. To say that Albert Einstein would have used a
computer would cross the line. Why would he need one? But it's
different to say he looked at the world differently.''
</P>
<P>
   That makes the Apple advertising a kind of commercialized,
updated version of songs like ``They All Laughed'' and ``You're the
Top,'' which paid tribute to such men and women of distinction as
Marconi, Garbo, Ford, O'Neill, Astaire and the Wright brothers. At
least two figures mentioned in those songs _ Edison and Gandhi _
have turned up in the Apple campaign.
</P>
<P>
   And of course there is a lengthy list of campaigns that feature
constellations of stars rather than single celebrities, from the
``Dewar's Profiles'' for Dewar's Scotch whisky to the khaki-clad
notables for Gap Inc. to the ``milk mustache'' ads created for the
National Fluid Milk Processor Promotion Board.
</P>
<P>
   Critics often complain that celebrities appearing in ads are
``selling out.'' Olivo said Apple and TBWA Chiat/Day ``haven't
really heard that,'' even about performers in the campaign like
Dylan and Joan Baez, ``perhaps because we don't use their work as
much as show them working.''
</P>
<P>
   The ads have already won several industry awards; the first
television commercial in the campaign has been nominated for an
Emmy. The ads have also inspired parodies. The ABC and CBS
television networks ran promotional spots spoofing the campaign,
while pranksters have posted ``Think different'' lampoons with
Charles Manson and Genghis Khan on Web sites.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   And there are games based on the campaign. One is to guess who
may next be featured in an ad; how about Steven Spielberg? Ray
Charles? Bill Gates? Another is to play ``Whozzat?'' with friends
and co-workers, asking them to identify some of the less familiar
faces like the dancer Martha Graham, the singer Maria Callas, the
photographer Ansel Adams, the architect Frank Gehry, and the
advertising executives Bill Bernbach and Mary Wells Lawrence.
</P>
<P>
   The genesis of the campaign was the crisis facing Apple last
year when Steven Jobs returned to run the company, which was
confronting huge problems that included plunging market share,
declining stock value and sagging employee morale. It was a year
ago Monday that Jobs decided to seek help by reuniting with Clow.
Jobs and Clow _ whose birthday is coincidentally Aug. 3 _
collaborated on Apple ads like the famous ``1984'' commercial when
Jobs originally ran Apple and Clow was the top creative executive
at the old Chiat/Day agency.
</P>
<P>
   ``They asked us to come in and talk about what Apple needed to
do to get its focus back,'' Clow said. ``It really wasn't hard; it
was just to go back to Apple's roots.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our thought was that Apple was not the computer on every
desk,'' he said, ``but the computer loved by most creative
communities like graphic designers, Web sites designers, film
makers, advertising agencies, because it doesn't get in the way of
the creativity. The analogy we made was to Harley-Davidson
motorcycles, which have been successful by being a unique product
for a unique audience.''
</P>
<P>
   At first, the agency wanted to show ``people currently using
Apple technology to articulate the `Think different' concept,''
Clow said, such as animators at Dreamworks SKG, ``but that didn't
seem quite a big enough statement.''
</P>
<P>
   Then one weekend, he added, ``we walked into a room and saw
`Think different' attached to Gandhi and Martin Luther King and
Einstein,'' paying tribute ``to creativity and genius by saluting
the kind of people who think and change things.'' Among those
involved in that ``Eureka!'' moment were Rob Siltanen, creative
director; Jessica Schulman, art director, and Craig Tanimoto,
copywriter.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign was swiftly approved by Apple, then begun with the
television commercial, which first ran on Sept. 28, followed by the
print ads, billboards and posters.
</P>
<P>
   It was always the intention to run the photos without
identifications, Clow said, citing a similar strategy pursued by
Chiat/Day for Nike Inc. during the 1984 Summer Olympics with wall
posters of athletes like Joan Benoit and Mary Decker.
</P>
<P>
   ``It becomes more involving and challenging to figure something
out,'' he explained, ``like solving a puzzle. Young people like it
because they feel they're not being talked down to. And the
knowledgeable people feel it's cool to be among the cognoscenti.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Olivo said, ``I can't tell you how many advertising
people called when the Wells ads ran to say, `I know I'm supposed
to know, but who's the woman?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Since then, TBWA Chiat/Day executives have sifted through
hundreds of suggestions, via letters and e-mail, for potential
enlistees for the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Jobs has been involved from the beginning, Clow said,
contributing ``people who thrill him like Buckminster Fuller'' and
helping secure photographs from sources like Ms. Ono.
</P>
<P>
   The one setback so far for the campaign has been a spate of
negative publicity generated by a decision not to run ads with the
Dalai Lama in Hong Kong to placate the Chinese Communists who
opposed him. (The ads continued in other countries.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Most companies probably wouldn't have gone near him in the
first place,'' Clow said.
</P>
<P>
   Determining who will appear in the campaign involves
negotiations with representatives of people who are living, and
sometimes the people themselves. With the dead, rights are obtained
from ``close family members, estates, lawyers,'' Clow said. ``Some
are harder, some are easier.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, he added, it is a question of ``getting the right
image of some people who are not here to photograph anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   As for payment, Olivo said, ``everyone has received
compensation, but not one has accepted money for personal gain.''
He and Clow said they were all given money and/or computer
equipment, which have been donated to schools, foundations,
charities and nonprofit organizations. They declined to discuss the
specific amounts.
</P>
<P>
   Olivo credited the campaign with a major role in the recent
improvement in Apple's fortunes. Though the company is still
struggling, Apple has surprised the naysayers by exceeding earnings
estimates from Wall Street for three consecutive quarters, selling
record numbers of G3 Macintosh computers, raising its stock price
and reducing employee turnover.
</P>
<P>
   ``It accomplished everything we wanted to in spades,'' Clow said
proudly, ``and so much more than we'd hoped.''
</P>
<P>
   There is a long wish list of personalities for future ads, said
Clow, citing the Beatles, Orson Welles, Jackie Robinson, Cesar
Chavez, John Glenn ``before he goes back into space'' and Charlie
Chaplin, which would also tweak an Apple rival because an actor
portraying Chaplin as the Little Tramp was once the focus of ads
for IBM.
</P>
<P>
   He said one of the biggest disappointments in the campaign was
the failure to get the wife and son of Jacques Cousteau to agree to
allow use of his photograph.
</P>
<P>
   On Olivo's wish list are Elvis Presley, Dag Hammarskjold, Jimi
Hendrix, ``maybe Nelson Mandela'' and perhaps Howard Cosell, who,
Olivo said, ``changed sportscasting _ but is that a heroic
enterprise?''
</P>
<P>
   Both want to include additional celebrities from Australia,
Japan and other countries outside North America.
</P>
<P>
   And on one issue, both think alike: They agree with a decision
by Jobs not to be the subject of an ad.

IBM TO ANNOUNCE AN ADVANCE IN CHIPS
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn.: N.Y., Calif.)   (jw) 
 By JOHN MARKOFF   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   IBM plans to announce on Monday that it has perfected a
significant new manufacturing process to produce semiconductor
chips that can achieve either higher speed or significantly lower
power consumption.
</P>
<P>
   Known as silicon-on-insulator, or SOI, technology, the new
technique is the third major advance in semiconductors that IBM has
announced in the last year. The company's top research executives
said that the latest advance should give IBM a lead of one to two
years in a highly competitive industry.
</P>
<P>
   In September, IBM reported that it would begin using copper to
connect transistors on its chips, advancing speed. And in June it
said it would start making silicon germanium chips, which are
expected to have a broad market soon in portable and wireless
consumer devices.
</P>
<P>
   The rapid-fire string of advances illustrates a major shift in
the origins of new technologies and the directions they follow as
they are adopted by the computer industry. Until the 1990s, new
technologies tended to trickle down from advanced military and
high-end corporate applications. But increasingly, the most
powerful innovations are deployed almost immediately to the vast
market for low-cost consumer electronics.
</P>
<P>
   IBM officials said that the realization of SOI technology
vindicated a persistent investment in a technology that for three
decades had been considered out of reach.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an important strategic advantage for IBM,'' said
Richard Doherty, an electrical engineer who worked on efforts to
develop the technology at Data General in the 1970s and who is now
president of Envisioneering Inc., a computer and consumer
electronics consulting firm.
</P>
<P>
   IBM engineers have found a way to embed an ultrathin layer of
insulating material just under the surface of a silicon wafer. The
insulating layer sharply reduces the amount of electronic charge a
transistor must store each time it is turned on.
</P>
<P>
   That will make it possible for IBM to increase the speed of its
chips by as much as 35 percent beginning in the first half of next
year. That is equal to the increase in performance typically
achieved in an entire generation of chips. The company said it also
planned to apply the process in the second half of 1999 to achieve
a significant reduction in the power requirements of chips for
portable applications.
</P>
<P>
   IBM executives estimated that the new process would initially
add about 10 percent to the costs of its chip-making process, but
they predicted that this could eventually be cut in half.
</P>
<P>
   The IBM process uses a machine called an ion implanter to push
oxygen molecules at great speeds so they come to rest beneath the
surface of a silicon wafer.
</P>
<P>
   The secret to the breakthrough, however, turned out to lie in an
annealing, or heating, process developed by IBM engineers. By
heating the wafers in a particular way after the oxide layer was
deposited, the engineers were able to form an almost perfect
silicon layer on the surface of the wafer. This silicon layer, only
400 or 500 atoms thick, is the key to transistors that can switch
electrical current on and off more quickly or can consume far less
energy in battery-powered devices.
</P>
<P>
   One significant consequence of the latest advance is that it
will help IBM's engineers protect chip circuitry from the troubling
effect of natural background radiation, which becomes an increasing
problem as the size of transistors shrinks with each new generation
of chips.
</P>
<P>
   Background radiation can corrupt data stored in memory chips,
producing what semiconductor engineers call soft errors. As the
chip industry moves toward line widths as fine as 0.18 microns _
about one five-hundredths of the width of a human hair _ soft
errors in data are a growing concern.
</P>
<P>
   ``A number of major chip makers have simply given up on the
technology,'' said Bryan Lewis, a semiconductor analyst at
Dataquest, a market research firm based in San Jose, Calif. ``But
this will have a dramatic impact on the industry. In 10 years it
will have taken over half of the industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone believes that the technology will give IBM a lead
that proves impossible to match, however. An Intel Corp.
semiconductor researcher said that Intel had evaluated the
technology in the past and decided that it would be a safer
strategy to press ahead with pure silicon.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, he acknowledged that in low-power applications, IBM's
process could provide a real advantage.

THE MAN WHO IS POISED TO BRING CHANGE TO GERMANY 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By ALAN COWELL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BAYREUTH, Germany _ Gerhard Schroder is the man who would be
Germany's next chancellor, and even if the opinion polls did not
consistently paint him as the front-runner in national elections
two months from now, his manner most certainly would.
</P>
<P>
   With his police security detail around him and his youthful
fourth wife, Doris Kopf, on his arm as he campaigned in this
Bavarian town, his step was firm and his smile as bright as the
television lights that feed his inner glow.
</P>
<P>
   The polls indicate that in the elections on Sept. 27, Schroder
could well wrest the leadership of Europe's most powerful land from
Chancellor Helmut Kohl, ending a 16-year, four-term run that has
made Kohl seem like an Olympian. It was obviously an omen,
Schroder's supporters from the Social Democratic opposition
observed, that the coming attraction in Bayreuth _ the high altar
of Wagnerian devotion _ was the opera - ``Gotter-dammerung'' _
``Twilight of the Gods.''
</P>
<P>
   The differences between the two men are all too evident. At age
54, compared with Kohl's 68, Schroder seeks to project himself as
the emblem of a new generation. He speaks with expansive gestures
geared to the TV cameras that Kohl reviles.
</P>
<P>
   Schroder's voice booms and a campaign banner behind him
proclaims: ``Political change for Germany _ innovation and
justice.'' After a 30-minute address, he leaps _ not too nimbly _
from the podium to sign autographs and to mingle. Virtually every
gesture seems designed to project energy and form a contrast with
the appearance of fatigue that sometimes hangs over Kohl.
</P>
<P>
   Yet here and at other election rallies in sports halls and beer
tents across conservative Bavaria, it soon emerged that he and Kohl
are offering some of the same message to court some of the same
people. The contest among undecided voters will be won on one
question: Who can make the better case to Germany's 62 million
voters that their land can be re-invented without pain?
</P>
<P>
   That is the question that preoccupies the people who have come
to see Schroder, ranging from the converted to the curious to the
skeptical, people like Monika Riess, 44, Hildegund Hornegger, 50,
and Mark Henkel, a 22-year-old law student _ all grist for the
``new center'' Schroder wants to mold, and all pondering who will
best strike a balance between renewal and security in these
uncertain times of globalization and unaccustomed competition from
beyond Germany's borders.
</P>
<P>
   `'You have to be modern, but you can't lose justice,'' Mrs.
Riess said, using the code word denoting Germany's social welfare
state.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are those like Mrs. Hornegger, a bank employee and
Social Democrat, who senses that change has already begun to take
away a German birthright. ``I want what we used to have to come
back,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Hornegger, who has arthritis, arrived on crutches with her
husband, Anton, 58, a postal worker. ``I'm expecting a lot from
Schroder,'' she said, sitting on one of the hard plastic seats laid
out in the Oberfrankenhalle. ``People expect him to do more at our
level.''
</P>
<P>
   She said she hoped he would reverse the health-care changes that
are costing her $1,250 a year for prescription drugs.
</P>
<P>
   But some think Schroder is short on substance. ``We don't need a
show _ we've got Helmut Kohl,'' said Henkel, the law student.
``He's the very image of security. And with him, what you get is
what you see.''
</P>
<P>
   But Henkel may be disappointed. If the election were held
immediately, surveys suggest, it would bring a sea change to
Germany _ and thus to Europe _ just as the Continent braces for the
strains of a single currency and a profound debate about its future
as an economic and political bloc.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   (MORE) nn
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly, this is a change of generation,'' Schroder said in
a brief interview here. ``It's a question of who has the strength
to mold the creative forces into the next millennium?''
</P>
<P>
   Schroder is to meet in Washington on Wednesday with President
Clinton when, his aides hope, he will offset the impression
conveyed by Clinton during a visit to Germany last May that the
U.S. president feels an exclusive bond with Kohl.
</P>
<P>
   But in Bavaria, where a state assembly vote two weeks before the
national vote could become a critical signal of his fortunes,
Schroder's prime concern is to convince his audience that cherished
social benefits _ free, or cheap, health care; good schools; solid
pensions _ will not be sacrificed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Globalization is a reality we have to deal with,'' he
proclaimed, urging the Social Democrats' traditionally left-leaning
and working-class bedrock to show ``flexibility'' in the workplace.
</P>
<P>
   ``The raw materials are in the minds of our people,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Schroder says he knows ``what the loss of material
possibilities'' means because he grew up in poverty. His father
died in World War II; his widowed mother took cleaning jobs to
raise the family.
</P>
<P>
   That differentiates Schroder from Britain's middle-class prime
minister, Tony Blair. But it is not the only difference. The Social
Democrats have not been remolded in the same way as Britain's ``New
Labor'' and Schroder's place in the party is ambiguous: he is its
candidate for reformist chancellor but not leader of its Socialist
core.
</P>
<P>
   And he would come to power at one of Germany's most difficult
times in the postwar era. The cost of hiring workers in Germany is
among the highest in the world. Social systems are creaking under
the strains of an aging society with high expectations of social
benefits financed by an ever-smaller labor force. Unemployment is
at postwar record highs, in excess of four million people.
</P>
<P>
   Schroder's critics say he offers only vague, feel-good
assurances and exhortations without detailed strategies. Underlying
that vagueness, though, is a calculation _ common to Kohl and other
political parties _ that what the voters want in September is
reassurance, not alarms, about the future of their pensions, their
health care, their sick pay and their unemployment benefits.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can only take people with you on a journey to change if
you give them the most basic measure of security,'' Schroder said
after the meeting here.
</P>
<P>
   His adversaries maintain that the journey he has in mind has
less to do with the people than with getting to the chancellor's
office. They say an overwhelming ambition has fueled his political
progress from a leftist Young Socialist to his current position as
premier of Lower Saxony in Hanover.
</P>
<P>
   Under Germany's electoral system, it is possible that he could
win the biggest chunk of votes but be able to rule only in
coalition. But he says he wants only the first prize.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have told my supporters in Lower Saxony that I either go to
Bonn as chancellor, or I'll stay in Hanover,'' he said.

CONGRESS WORKS TO RECONCILE 3 VERSIONS OF INTERNET TAX BILL
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn.: Va., R.I., Neb., Del., N.D.)   (jw) 
 By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A proposed six-year moratorium on taxes in cyberspace would be
reduced to only two years under the version of the Internet Tax
Freedom Act approved by the Senate Finance Committee.
</P>
<P>
   The committee also voted last week to force states and local
governments that tax Internet access to end these taxes, but left
untouched claims for millions of dollars in taxes that America
Online did not collect from customers and may now have to pay at
its own expense.
</P>
<P>
   The Finance Committee's version of the bill differs
significantly from those passed by the House and by the Senate
Commerce Committee. The House version calls for a three-year
moratorium, while the Senate Commerce Committee's version would
keep the six-year moratorium.
</P>
<P>
   Both the House and the Senate Commerce Committee versions would
block states from citing the presence of computer servers to
establish a company's physical presence within a state. The Senate
Finance Committee's version is silent on this issue.
</P>
<P>
   Until most of these and other differences are worked out, the
bill is unlikely to reach the Senate floor for a vote. The Senate
is in recess until the end of the month.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet Tax Freedom Coalition, the leading electronic
commerce group lobbying to make cyberspace free of taxes and
tariffs, contends that confusion about taxes is hampering the
growth of commerce in cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   That argument was rejected by Sen. John Chafee, R-R.I., and Sen.
Bob Kerrey, D-Neb., both members of the Finance Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Chafee, citing testimony by America Online that electronic
commerce will grow to $20 billion by 2000, said a two-year
moratorium was enough to determine how to tax cyberspace
transactions properly.
</P>
<P>
   Kerrey dismissed the arguments of industry lobbyists that taxes
are crippling electronic commerce. ``This is no infant industry in
swaddling clothes,'' he said, citing 30 percent growth a month in
retail sales on the Internet. ``Wall Street can't throw money at
Internet companies fast enough.''
</P>
<P>
   The 19-1 vote by the Senate Finance Committee to approve its
version of the bill came on Tuesday, the same day that the Commerce
Department issued a report showing a growing disparity in access to
the Internet among various income groups. People making more than
$75,000 a year are seven times as likely to have access to the
Internet as those making $15,000 to $20,000 a year and more than
twice as likely as those making $35,000 to $50,000.
</P>
<P>
   The concept of making the Internet a tax-free zone was
criticized by Michael Maserov, a senior policy analyst with the
Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. ``This is just one more tax
break for the affluent at the expense of the poor,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate Finance Committee rejected, on a 10-10 vote, a
proposal by Sen. Kent Conrad, D-N.D., that would have allowed
states that tax Internet access and data sold over the Internet to
continue those levies.
</P>
<P>
   Conrad, who was formerly his state's elected tax commissioner,
said he saw no compelling reason for the federal government to
interfere with state tax policies.
</P>
<P>
   The ``ability of states or local governments to collect tax'' on
transactions before July 29 would not be affected by the Senate
Finance Committee's version of the bill, according to committee
Chairman Sen. William Roth Jr., R-Del.
</P>
<P>
   That provision is a serious setback for America Online, the
nation's largest Internet service provider, which collects sales
taxes on behalf of foreign governments but has refused to collect
the same taxes when they are required by the states and local
governments. &QL;

KARL SCHIRDEWAN, EAST GERMANY PARTY RENEGADE, DIES
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By ERIC PACE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Karl Schirdewan, a high-ranking figure in the old East German
communist government who wanted to ``democratize'' the Communist
Party but lost a power struggle and fell into disgrace, has died in
Potsdam, Germany. He was 91.
</P>
<P>
   His death was reported on July 17 in the Frankfurter Allgemeine
Zeitung, which did not say when he died.
</P>
<P>
   Schirdewan was born in Konigsberg, Germany, and became a worker
and a communist functionary. He was arrested after Hitler came to
power for illegal party activity and was interned in concentration
camps.
</P>
<P>
   In the postwar era he rose swiftly in the East German Communist
Party. He was elected to its Politburo in 1953 and came to be
described as the No. 2 man to the dictator Walter Ulbricht, an
uncompromising Stalinist.
</P>
<P>
   But in a 1972 book, ``The Changing Party Elite in East
Germany,'' Peter Ludz, a West German professor of political
science, wrote that Schirdewan and two like-minded Politburo
members came to constitute ``the last political alternative to the
Ulbricht group'' within the party and that the elimination of that
alternative was decided upon by its opponents.
</P>
<P>
   ``Schirdewan's wish to `democratize' the party was perceived as
a threat,'' Ludz wrote, and ``after a decisive struggle,'' the
Ulbricht faction ``succeeded in re-establishing its positions of
power.''
</P>
<P>
   On Feb. 8, 1958, Schirdewan and his two allies were expelled
from the party's Central Committee and Politburo. The decision to
expel them was made at a meeting of the Central Committee.
Essentially, the three were accused of wanting to democratize the
party, decentralize the East German economic system and introduce
certain intellectual freedoms.
</P>
<P>
   Schirdewan was relegated to an obscure government post but was
rehabilitated by the party in 1990.

 &HT;    U.S. boxers revel in silver
 &HT;    By Karen Rosen
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Georgians Ebo Elder and Jacob Hudson got a taste of
the New York night life at the theater: the Theater at Madison
Square Garden, where the 19-year-old boxers battled to Goodwill
Games silver medals.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've had three nights of the most fun I've ever had,'' Hudson
said in the wee hours of Sunday morning after he and Elder posed
for team pictures. ''Hard to believe you got two guys from Georgia,
who are like brothers, sitting here with silver medals. This is
awesome.''
</P>
<P>
   The two blonds, who lost decisively in their final bouts, are
developing a reputation in the boxing world. The New York Post
called Elder ''The Albino Assassin.'' Hudson, to his Cuban
opponent, was simply ''The American.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the competition, they had the most vocal cheering
sections of any fighters. Not only did they have family in the
audience, they were supported by strangers willing to hoist
hand-lettered signs that said ''Jacob! Jacob!'' on one side and
''Ebo! Ebo!'' on the other.
</P>
<P>
   Elder, of Newnan, Ga., lost the final to U.S. teammate Ricardo
Williams Jr. in the light welterweight (139-pound) division 16-4
Saturday night. It was Elder's third loss this year to Williams.
</P>
<P>
   About 24 hours earlier, Hudson, of Augusta, Ga., was out-pointed
by Cuba's Mario Kindelan in the lightweight (132-pound) division
13-4. Both bouts were shown on HBO.
</P>
<P>
   The two runner-ups are close, having known each other since they
were about 10, and used to punch in the same weight class.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've had some great fights together,'' said Elder. Both
claimed not to know their record against each other.
</P>
<P>
   ''Ebo was smaller for a long time,'' Hudson said, ''and all of a
sudden, he takes some time off (after the 1996 Olympic trials) and
he's twice as big as me.''
</P>
<P>
   Each is learning from international experience as they head
toward the 2000 Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   ''I didn't know what to expect as far as the outcome, but I knew
I was giving 100 percent,'' Elder said. ''It came out very good,
maybe not the best, but we're having fun with it anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   For Hudson, the Goodwill Games offered his first chance to box
against an opponent from Cuba, which has traditionally fielded some
of the world's best fighters.
</P>
<P>
   ''I thought I was a little bit stronger than he was, and he
didn't like my strength,'' Hudson said. ''He wanted to lean on top
of me. He knew he was ahead, so all he did was run. I tried to wave
him to come on, but he didn't want to come on, because he knew
that's where my fight is _ inside. He did what was smart.''
</P>
<P>
   Both fighters are in the U.S. mix for the Sydney Games.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've got a whole team of young fighters who all have the
ability to do whatever they want,'' Elder said, ''as long as they
work for it.''

 &HT;    Saving Pvt. Ryan: How did they do that? What did that mean?
Here's the scoop
 &HT;    By Jill Vejnoska
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   You've heard the hype. Read the reviews. Seen the movie _
``Saving Private Ryan.'' Still want to know more about director
Steven Spielberg's intense World War II movie?
</P>
<P>
   Read on. We've emptied our notebooks and spared no trivia in
assembling this story about the drama that has captured Hollywood's
box office and America's imagination.
</P>
<P>
   _ Where's the music? Believe it or not, in this age of big
soundtrack movies, the two-hour, 50-minute ``Saving Private Ryan''
contains only 38 minutes of music. That's according to Spielberg,
who says the silence was intentional _ especially during the nearly
half-hour opening scenes of D-Day.
</P>
<P>
   ``John Williams, who's done every one of my movies, was the
first one to say, `Thank goodness I don't have to score the war
scenes,''' Spielberg said during a recent Atlanta visit. ``John
said, `I'd love to see a few of the battle scenes from the `Raiders
of the Lost Ark' movies with my music out, to see if it lends more
realism to those scenes without the Hollywood orchestra playing
along.''
</P>
<P>
   There is, however, a soundtrack with Williams' ``Ryan'' music,
including the moving ``Hymn to the Fallen,'' which opens and closes
the CD.
</P>
<P>
   _ Where's the dialogue? War may be hell, but it's not
particularly chatty. That's according to famed military author
Stephen E. Ambrose (``Citizen Soldiers,'' ``Band of Brothers''),
who served as a historical consultant on ``Ryan.''
</P>
<P>
   Spielberg's film is rife with such realistic touches as mortally
wounded soldiers ``wetting their pants and pleading for mother,''
Ambrose said, adding that gunfire often masks most of the
battlefield talk in ``Ryan.'' That's heresy by the standards of the
Hollywood that turned out such glamorous World War II epics as
1962's ``The Longest Day.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In (`Longest Day' producer Darryl) Zanuck's film and in all
the others, whenever there's dialogue, the sounds of battle
mysteriously disappear,'' Ambrose said. ``Zanuck wasn't going to
pay John Wayne all those big bucks and then not hear what he had to
say.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've seen the Spielberg film. You've gotta lean forward and
you still miss half the dialogue,'' Ambrose continued approvingly.
``It's because of the battle noise. Because that's the way it
happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Napoleon not included: Spielberg broke with a lot of war movie
convention in making his film, including the one about rank having
its (height) privileges.
</P>
<P>
   ``The officer is always taller than the enlisted men (in typical
war movies),'' said Lewis H. Carlson, a Western Michigan University
history professor whose oral histories of World War II POWs was
just published in paperback under the title ``We Were Each Other's
Prisoners.''
</P>
<P>
   The height report on ``Ryan''?
</P>
<P>
   Capt. Miller (Tom Hanks) may be the highest-ranking, but ``he's
not the tallest,'' Spielberg said. ``As a matter of fact, I think
Tom Sizemore (who plays the second-in-command sergeant) and Eddie
Burns (a private) are the same size as him. And Vin Diesel (another
private) is taller.''
</P>
<P>
   _ The mystery word: He may be fluent in several languages, but
Cpl. Upham (Jeremy Davies) has never heard the word FUBAR _ a
favorite acronym among the soldiers, standing for a hopeless
situation _ when he joins Hanks' platoon as a translator.
</P>
<P>
   Upham's not the only one: Spielberg admitted he was unfamiliar
with that authentic piece of Army slang until his father, a World
War II vet, brought it to his attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``My dad said, `Do you have the word FUBAR in this film?' And I
said `no,''' Spielberg recalled. ``He told me what it meant and he
said, `We used to say it all the time,' so we wrote the scenes in.
The whole thing came from my dad.''
</P>
<P>
   FUBAR. Upham spends much of ``Ryan'' trying to learn what it
means. So will you. Here's a hint _ the ``B-A-R'' stands for ``...
beyond all recognition.''
</P>
<P>
   _ The very first review? Everything on ``Ryan'' was about 95
percent complete when it got its first full viewing by ... who
else? Spielberg. But Ambrose was close on his heels, although not
without a bit of persuading.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was the second person to see it,'' recalled Ambrose, who had
no hand in writing the script although Hanks and Spielberg read his
books. ``DreamWorks called me and said, `Mr. Spielberg would like
you to fly to Los Angeles to see the film and tell us what's right
about it and what's wrong.' And I said, `I ain't gonna fly to L.A.
to see a movie!' They were a little startled at that.''
</P>
<P>
   Ambrose said they could send him a video in New Orleans, but
instead, DreamWorks flew in the movie and an assistant producer.
</P>
<P>
   ``They rented a theater and they didn't let a regular
projectionist screen it,'' Ambrose went on. ``And I'm sitting all
alone in this 1,000-seat theater and I went in thinking, `Jesus, I
hope this is better than Oliver Stone! (who Ambrose says drew on
another one of his books for the assailed film ``Nixon'') It's no
fun saying a movie's lousy.'
</P>
<P>
   ``Ryan'' was no ``Nixon.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I came out just an emotional, physical wreck,'' Ambrose
concluded quietly. ``The (assistant producer) said, `What do you
think?' And I said, `It's the best war movie ever made.'''
</P>
<P>
   _ Whaddya mean it's not perfect?! While Ambrose says Spielberg
got virtually everything right in ``Ryan'' _ the weapons _ he did
wish the director could've included a few other things to make it
even more authentic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've heard that movie theaters have played around with
smell,'' Ambrose said several weeks ago in Atlanta. ``I said (to
Spielberg) `You know, you could (ITAL) really (END ITAL) overwhelm
if you had the smell of cordite in the air.' And the other thing
is, there's a lot more smoke on a battlefield than you see in this
movie. He didn't even have to reply to that. I just said it, but I
know perfectly well what the reply is: How do you make a movie
where all you see is smoke?
</P>
<P>
   ``I also suggested that they would not have sent a captain in
command of an eight-man squad. It would've been a second
lieutenant. And I was talking to Tom Hanks on the plane (to
Atlanta) and he said he wished that he (ITAL) had (END ITAL) been a
second lieutenant, you know, it would've been more appropriate. But
Spielberg wanted him to be a captain, so he was a captain!''
</P>
<P>
   _ No kilts this time: Of the large number of extras in the D-Day
scene, 750 came from the Irish army. And they weren't new to
movies. Many had worked on Mel Gibson's ``Braveheart.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Which way to the beach? Since the real Omaha Beach is a
protected historical landmark, and it has become too developed over
the years to use as an authentic WWII movie site, filmmakers found
a stretch of beach on the southeast coast of Ireland that resembled
the famous landing spot. They filmed the D-Day landing on the shore
of County Wexford.
</P>
<P>
   _ The remainder of the film was shot in England, most of it at
an abandoned British Aerospace facility in Hatfield, Hertfordshire,
45 minutes north of London. The wheat field seen as part of Pvt.
Ryan's Iowa farm is actually in Marlborough.
</P>
<P>
   _ Why all the bloodshed? ``Omaha Beach was a slaughter,''
Spielberg says in the film's press kit. ``It was a complete
foul-up: from the expeditionary forces, to the reconnaissance
forces, to the saturation bombing that missed most of its primary
targets. Given that, I didn't want to glamorize it, so I tried to
be as brutally honest as I could.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Historical Q&AMP;A:
</P>
<P>
   Question: In preparing to ambush German troops, Hanks and his
men assemble crude bombs that stick to the sides of tanks. Was
there really such a thing as a ``sticky bomb''?
</P>
<P>
   Answer: The film's military adviser Dale Dye notes that sticky
bombs were commonly used and are referred to in the ``Ranger
Handbook of Field Expedient Devices.'' In light of this knowledge,
an expert contacted by the Los Angeles Times found it odd that
Hanks had to explain to his men what sticky bombs were. ``Anyone
who had gone through basic (training) would have known what they
were,'' said Ted Ballard, a historian at the U.S. Army Center of
Military History in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   _ And yours as a human being? Reviews have been nearly
unanimously positive about ``Saving Private Ryan.'' But there has
been at least one professional naysayer. John Podhoretz in the
Weekly Standard, a conservative thought magazine, wrote: ``Omaha
Beach was a site of tragedy and triumph, and it was triumph that
gave meaning to the tragedy. Spielberg's inability to grasp those
ideas ... shows his limitations not only as an artist but as an
adult.''

 &HT;    Summer's father-son reunion will last more than a lifetime
 &HT;    By Paul Reid
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Each morning for the last three weeks my
6-year-old son, Patrick, awakened me with the same words: Dad,
let's go check the baby bird. And each morning we would quietly
exit the back door and add another installment to our backyard saga
of life, death, deceit, cunning, determination and strength.
</P>
<P>
   My son is a product of the new American divorce, a boy who knows
his way around airplanes, airports and the rules of carry-on
baggage. Three weeks is his allotted summer vacation time with me.
Three weeks to connect and then, just like that, disconnect, pack
the bag, make the bed, put away the Legos and pool toys until the
next time.
</P>
<P>
   His teenage sister, Mary, lives here, but the other, Georgia, is
in Paris for the summer studying art. It's the first summer she's
missed, and I miss her. In past years I started counting the hours
to their departure before their plane touched down. Now, I count
just Patrick's.
</P>
<P>
   So, when a family of cardinals set up house in a Chinese orchid
tree just below Patrick's bedroom window, I thought: This is nice.
This is stuff memories are made of. Cozy lessons about life will
devolve upon Patrick, I thought.
</P>
<P>
   First lesson: Birds die.
</P>
<P>
   On the morning Patrick flew in from Boston, three baby birds
squawked in the nest. We erected a stepladder about 10 feet from
the nest, so as not to bother the birds. Then we peeked. Every hour
thereafter Patrick had to climb the ladder to sneak a peek. The
next day he noticed the attrition.
</P>
<P>
   A bird is gone, Dad.
</P>
<P>
   These things happen, Pat.
</P>
<P>
   Find it, Dad.
</P>
<P>
   Late that night, with Patrick asleep upstairs, I sipped a coffee
and watched a rising full moon make long shadows in the yard. And
there on the pool deck, still warm from the afternoon sun, basked a
big rat snake. With a bulge in his belly.
</P>
<P>
   Up the ladder I went, with a flashlight. A look in the nest.
Another bird gone. Just one remained.
</P>
<P>
   I grabbed the long aluminum pool pole and jabbed the snake. It
wrapped itself around that pole in a perfect coil. A sailor
couldn't have done better. Then I launched it over the hedge into a
tall palmetto palm.
</P>
<P>
   One bird left. If that little puff ball went missing, I'd put a
fake bird in the nest.
</P>
<P>
   Next morning I told Patrick of the incident.
</P>
<P>
   From then on, he asked to check the remaining bird every
half-hour. I think he asked in his sleep.
</P>
<P>
   Then the grackles came, devious and cowardly devils that would
flee the tree as I stabbed at them with the long pole. Then they'd
circle back and come from the other side. For two days the grackles
came. Don't hurt them, Dad, said Patrick. Just make them go away.
</P>
<P>
   Then the mockingbirds. Brazen fellows. I lunged at them with the
pole and they'd step off their branches right onto the tip, as if
to say, thank you, now just drop us in yonder nest.
</P>
<P>
   Tree frogs. Do they eat birds? We consult the nature books.
Carpenter ants, curly-tailed lizards. The orchid tree was alive
with peril.
</P>
<P>
   Then came the thunderstorms. And who do we find on the wet
bricks under the nest after one deluge but the bird. It's hopping,
in a pathetic sort of way. Its parents are hopping mad.
</P>
<P>
   Build a nest, Dad. So we put the bird in a big, wicker dog bed
stuffed with leaves and Spanish moss.
</P>
<P>
   More rains the next day. The bird is a wet, quivering ball of
fuzz. I put an umbrella over the dog bed, but I'm sure the bird is
doomed.
</P>
<P>
   For three mornings running I dread the status check. But each
morning, there it is, dry and pouting for food. Patrick keeps his
distance, but he tells the bird everything will be OK. What does he
know?
</P>
<P>
   Then a couple of days later the bird hops up on the edge of the
dog bed. Its parents are across the yard, calling. The chick
flutters off the nest and begins stumbling across the yard with all
the grace of a drunk on a tilted sidewalk. The parents swoop down
and sweep the grass with their wings. The chick imitates them. He's
airborne. Maybe 2 inches high.
</P>
<P>
   The family disappears into the brush. We hear them for two days.
Three voices, one very high. Then, they're gone. Three weeks, start
to finish.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick packs his bag. He's leaving. The nest high in the tree
is empty. I don't look forward to seeing it sway in the fall winds.
I might take it out.
</P>
<P>
   Where's the bird, asks Patrick.
</P>
<P>
   Airborne, gone, growing up, seeing the world, I tell him.
</P>
<P>
   Just like Georgia in Paris, he says.
</P>
<P>
   Yup, just like your sister, I say.

 &HT;    It's Bill's fault, but it's Hillary who let us down
 &HT;    By Emily J. Minor
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ It was about 11 in the morning before I
could pick up the front page of the newspaper. I guess seeing it in
black and white made it that much more distasteful.
</P>
<P>
   ``We agreed to deny it,'' the headline said, and I knew right
then I wasn't going to like what I was about to read.
</P>
<P>
   So I came to work and drank my coffee and pretended to be both
well-informed and well-adjusted about Bill Clinton's shortcomings,
which we've known for awhile now are many. And as the day, and my
nerve, progressed, I began to gingerly digest the details of the
Monica Lewinsky immunity deal almost as though I was snapping back
from the flu and had to start off with a glass of flat ginger ale.
</P>
<P>
   Sips. Little sips.
</P>
<P>
   What's so unfair about all this is that I should be furious with
him. The realist in me knows that. I should hate him. Detest him. I
should forget about the kid from Hope and the bumper sticker I put
on my truck seven years ago and the way he and Hillary looked at
each other as they danced on the night of his first election.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, I'm furious with Hillary.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, I'm thinking, ``How could she? Why did she?''
</P>
<P>
   It's unfair, I suppose, to turn so quickly on a woman whom I
have always held in such high regard. And if ever Hillary needed a
good friend, it is now. But part of my anger is so simple, really,
so basic.
</P>
<P>
   She's not living the life she's telling us to lead. She's not
leading the life she deserves.
</P>
<P>
   Women supported Hillary Clinton, and thus, her husband, because
she is smart and powerful and appeared to be kind and generous.
Women supported her because she was a good mom. Hillary affirmed
all the things we knew about ourselves but were still just a little
unsure of. We'd hacked our way through the male world for so long
that we still loved the repetition.
</P>
<P>
   But what kind of lesson did she teach us, really? More to the
point, what kind of lesson did she teach her impressionable
daughter, Chelsea? That it's OK to go through a marriage constantly
worrying that your husband might be with another woman? That
cheating's OK as long as the two of you are good and powerful
together?
</P>
<P>
   A big part of me can't wait for someone to hurry up and write
the Clinton's inside story. I am hoping, praying, for a few
late-breaking good reasons that might make it as clear as a bell
why Hillary stood by her man for all these years.
</P>
<P>
   Yet I realize a good explanation is impossible. I think I knew
that back in January when I first heard the words Clinton, intern
and black dress strung together.
</P>
<P>
   I had another column ready to go for today. It was a lovely
story about my dear friend's coming marriage and the fact she's
found her first real love at age 41. But publishing a story about
the bliss of romance four days after I sat at my desk with a sour
stomach and sipped the Monica-Bill story somehow didn't seem right.
</P>
<P>
   It seemed a little like I was going through life with my heart
in the right place _ but my head on wrong. And I'm afraid Hillary's
done enough of that for all of us.

 &HT;    Saving Pvt. Ryan: How did they do that? What did that mean?
Here's the scoop
 &HT;    By Jill Vejnoska
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   You've heard the hype. Read the reviews. Seen the movie _
``Saving Private Ryan.'' Still want to know more about director
Steven Spielberg's intense World War II movie?
</P>
<P>
   Read on. We've emptied our notebooks and spared no trivia in
assembling this story about the drama that has captured Hollywood's
box office and America's imagination.
</P>
<P>
   _ Where's the music? Believe it or not, in this age of big
soundtrack movies, the two-hour, 50-minute ``Saving Private Ryan''
contains only 38 minutes of music. That's according to Spielberg,
who says the silence was intentional _ especially during the nearly
half-hour opening scenes of D-Day.
</P>
<P>
   ``John Williams, who's done every one of my movies, was the
first one to say, `Thank goodness I don't have to score the war
scenes,''' Spielberg said during a recent Atlanta visit. ``John
said, `I'd love to see a few of the battle scenes from the `Raiders
of the Lost Ark' movies with my music out, to see if it lends more
realism to those scenes without the Hollywood orchestra playing
along.''
</P>
<P>
   There is, however, a soundtrack with Williams' ``Ryan'' music,
including the moving ``Hymn to the Fallen,'' which opens and closes
the CD.
</P>
<P>
   _ Where's the dialogue? War may be hell, but it's not
particularly chatty. That's according to famed military author
Stephen E. Ambrose (``Citizen Soldiers,'' ``Band of Brothers''),
who served as a historical consultant on ``Ryan.''
</P>
<P>
   Spielberg's film is rife with such realistic touches as mortally
wounded soldiers ``wetting their pants and pleading for mother,''
Ambrose said, adding that gunfire often masks most of the
battlefield talk in ``Ryan.'' That's heresy by the standards of the
Hollywood that turned out such glamorous World War II epics as
1962's ``The Longest Day.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In (`Longest Day' producer Darryl) Zanuck's film and in all
the others, whenever there's dialogue, the sounds of battle
mysteriously disappear,'' Ambrose said. ``Zanuck wasn't going to
pay John Wayne all those big bucks and then not hear what he had to
say.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've seen the Spielberg film. You've gotta lean forward and
you still miss half the dialogue,'' Ambrose continued approvingly.
``It's because of the battle noise. Because that's the way it
happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Napoleon not included: Spielberg broke with a lot of war movie
convention in making his film, including the one about rank having
its (height) privileges.
</P>
<P>
   ``The officer is always taller than the enlisted men (in typical
war movies),'' said Lewis H. Carlson, a Western Michigan University
history professor whose oral histories of World War II POWs was
just published in paperback under the title ``We Were Each Other's
Prisoners.''
</P>
<P>
   The height report on ``Ryan''?
</P>
<P>
   Capt. Miller (Tom Hanks) may be the highest-ranking, but ``he's
not the tallest,'' Spielberg said. ``As a matter of fact, I think
Tom Sizemore (who plays the second-in-command sergeant) and Eddie
Burns (a private) are the same size as him. And Vin Diesel (another
private) is taller.''
</P>
<P>
   _ The mystery word: He may be fluent in several languages, but
Cpl. Upham (Jeremy Davies) has never heard the word FUBAR _ a
favorite acronym among the soldiers, standing for a hopeless
situation _ when he joins Hanks' platoon as a translator.
</P>
<P>
   Upham's not the only one: Spielberg admitted he was unfamiliar
with that authentic piece of Army slang until his father, a World
War II vet, brought it to his attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``My dad said, `Do you have the word FUBAR in this film?' And I
said `no,''' Spielberg recalled. ``He told me what it meant and he
said, `We used to say it all the time,' so we wrote the scenes in.
The whole thing came from my dad.''
</P>
<P>
   FUBAR. Upham spends much of ``Ryan'' trying to learn what it
means. So will you. Here's a hint _ the ``B-A-R'' stands for ``...
beyond all recognition.''
</P>
<P>
   _ The very first review? Everything on ``Ryan'' was about 95
percent complete when it got its first full viewing by ... who
else? Spielberg. But Ambrose was close on his heels, although not
without a bit of persuading.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was the second person to see it,'' recalled Ambrose, who had
no hand in writing the script although Hanks and Spielberg read his
books. ``DreamWorks called me and said, `Mr. Spielberg would like
you to fly to Los Angeles to see the film and tell us what's right
about it and what's wrong.' And I said, `I ain't gonna fly to L.A.
to see a movie!' They were a little startled at that.''
</P>
<P>
   Ambrose said they could send him a video in New Orleans, but
instead, DreamWorks flew in the movie and an assistant producer.
</P>
<P>
   ``They rented a theater and they didn't let a regular
projectionist screen it,'' Ambrose went on. ``And I'm sitting all
alone in this 1,000-seat theater and I went in thinking, `Jesus, I
hope this is better than Oliver Stone! (who Ambrose says drew on
another one of his books for the assailed film ``Nixon'') It's no
fun saying a movie's lousy.'
</P>
<P>
   ``Ryan'' was no ``Nixon.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I came out just an emotional, physical wreck,'' Ambrose
concluded quietly. ``The (assistant producer) said, `What do you
think?' And I said, `It's the best war movie ever made.'''
</P>
<P>
   _ Whaddya mean it's not perfect?! While Ambrose says Spielberg
got virtually everything right in ``Ryan'' _ the weapons _ he did
wish the director could've included a few other things to make it
even more authentic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've heard that movie theaters have played around with

 &HT;    Graphic `Ryan' reopening veterans' emotional wounds
 &HT;    By Carolyn Susman
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ ``Whe-e-e-e-ew,'' Chip DuFour whistled
through his teeth. ``Welcome to the real war.''
</P>
<P>
   The Vietnam combat veteran was picking at a hot plate special at
Denny's after viewing Steven Spielberg's controversial new movie,
Saving Private Ryan.
</P>
<P>
   The three-hour film is a graphic and relentless look at the
storming of Omaha Beach in France during World War II, and its
brutal depiction of war has been especially disturbing to some
veterans.
</P>
<P>
   So much so that the Department of Veterans Affairs alerted
counselors nationwide and set up extended hours on its hot line _
(800) 827-1000 _ when the movie opened two weekends ago. The 800
number is still available.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first 30 minutes, I couldn't take my eyes off the
screen,'' said DuFour. ``It stirred up a lot of feelings. I may not
get much sleep tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   Homeless until he landed recently at Vetsville Cease Fire House,
a West Palm Beach shelter for veterans of all wars, DuFour attended
the movie with Chris Noel, Cease Fire House's founder. Noel, a
former actress and model, saw the terrors of Vietnam as an
entertainer and radio show hostess who toured battlefields.
</P>
<P>
   Both were especially shaken by the graphic World War II scenes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen death before ... '' DuFour trailed off, but then
admitted, ``The old arm went up (to protect himself) in defense.''
</P>
<P>
   These reactions are typical and normal for combat veterans,
especially those who thought they had coped well, says Dr. William
Weitz, a clinical psychologist at the Palm Beach Vet Center in Lake
Worth, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   Weitz, who hasn't been in combat but has worked with veterans
for 30 years, says the movie ``is unearthing the emotional
component of (World War II) that hasn't ever been resolved.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Veterans) assume they're having a psychiatric breakdown. One
of the things we want to do is say, `That's not the case.' It's a
normal and natural reaction to trauma that's been unearthed at this
time. We can help them understand where this is coming from, so
they're not overwhelmed.''
</P>
<P>
   Right after the movie opened, some 100 veterans called the
national hot line with symptoms such as crying, anxiety and
heightened excitement.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're emotionally responding in ways that are not controlled
or calm,'' Weitz said. ``The stimulus is the film.''
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Troyer, a Vietnam combat veteran and clinical social
worker, agrees that veterans should understand that an overly
emotional reaction doesn't mean they're crazy or going off the deep
end.
</P>
<P>
   ``They should realize this is connected to something they've
experienced,'' he said. ``I've seen suppressed trauma pop up 50
years later.''
</P>
<P>
   Troyer, the manager of the Mental Health Clinic at the VA
Medical Center in West Palm Beach, says he's had veterans walk in
who were disturbed by the film and said it triggered a bad
reaction.
</P>
<P>
   Other films have stirred similar reactions. The VA set up a hot
line when Oliver Stone's Platoon was released, and Troyer says even
Titanic's drowning sequences triggered a delayed onset of Post
Traumatic Stress Disorder in some World War II Navy veterans.
</P>
<P>
   It should be noted that veterans aren't the only ones
emotionally affected by Saving Private Ryan.
</P>
<P>
   Jupiter, Fla. psychologist Dr. David Shaw saw the movie and
heard people crying and sobbing in the audience. Even though he
isn't a combat veteran, he said it took him two hours ``to come
down'' after the film was over.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here comes Steven Spielberg with an extremely graphic film
showing really great details in terms of violence of people being
killed,'' Shaw says. ``It makes perfect sense that anybody who
fought in any war or witnessed violence in any capacity may have a
Post Traumatic Stress reaction.''
</P>
<P>
   He advises anyone who is disturbed by the movie to talk to
someone they trust.
</P>
<P>
   ``But if it really creates a reaction _ flashbacks, sleep
disturbance _ absolutely, they should been seen by a
professional.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people think talking about it makes it worse,'' Shaw
says, ``but it really would be helpful.''

 &HT;    GSU prof: Movies cast elderly in a negative light
 &HT;    (EDS: Jaye Shaner is cq)
 &HT;    By Ellen Lee
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The emperor in the ``Return of the Jedi'' is the
epitome of bad. So is Judge Doom, who tries to destroy Toontown in
``Who Framed Roger Rabbit.''
</P>
<P>
   They're old, too. Emperor Palpatine, in fact, is probably 100 to
200 years old, at least in the land of the Dark Side.
</P>
<P>
   Coincidence? A Georgia State University professor thinks not. In
a study of 1980s blockbuster movies, Jaye Shaner, an assistant
professor of communication, found that older adults are rarely seen
in major movies and when they are, they are often portrayed as
evil.
</P>
<P>
   Shaner and graduate student assistant Kristen Davis studied the
top two movies for each year from 1980 to 1988, taking notes on the
characters who spoke, their portrayal and dialogue, including any
reference to age or aging. They also counted how many adults older
than 60 appeared in each movie.
</P>
<P>
   The emperor and the judge were two of many characters Shaner
analyzed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to know how many older characters there were and what
they're saying,'' Shaner said. ``We wanted to see the messages
they're sending about being old and young.''
</P>
<P>
   A few movies, such as ``E.T.: the Extra-Terrestrial,'' had none
or very few older adults. In total, 7 percent of the characters
were older than 60.
</P>
<P>
   That's small compared with the actual percentage of older adults
in the United States, Shaner said. In 1990, 12.6 percent of the
U.S. population _ 31 million people _ was age 65 or older. The U.S.
census estimates that by 2020, older adults will number nearly 53.2
million.
</P>
<P>
   Yet more distressing, she said, was that many of the older
characters turned out to be the bad guys.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not so worried about whether they're present. I'm more
worried about what their presence is like when they are there,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm bothered about the evil in its purest form, but I'm also
bothered because these movies are attractive to children,'' Shaner
said. These negative portrayals of older people, especially in such
popular movies, could promote stereotypes, she added.
</P>
<P>
   Making older adults the bad guys makes sense, said Bard
Lindeman, 69, of Stone Mountain, who writes a syndicated column
about aging and is a former editor of the magazine New Choices,
formerly known as 50 Plus. Because of society's perceptions of
aging, it's a logical and convenient step to make older adults evil
and cruel.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's easy to portray this older person (as evil). Perhaps he's
frail, perhaps he's fighting osteoporosis, so he has a hump or
something, so the next correlation is to make him look poorly and
act poorly,'' Lindeman said.
</P>
<P>
   But older adults are not the only ones stereotyped in movies,
Shaner found. The ``perfect age'' in the movies may be somewhere
between the late 20s and early 30s, because she found that both
older and younger adults often fall into certain stereotypes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being old is bad and being young is bad. When you're under 28,
you're called `kid' in a derogatory fashion,'' Shaner said. ``But
when you become older, say 35, you suddenly become set in your
ways.''
</P>
<P>
   Shaner plans to present her findings in November at the National
Communication Association convention. She also intends to continue
investigating the portrayal of older adults in movies from the
1930s to the 1990s. As baby boomers grow older, she's also looking
at whether changing demographics lead to more or fewer older
characters and how they are portrayed. Shaner's findings point to
the responsibility Hollywood and the media have in influencing the
public's perception of older adults, said Charlee Lambert, a writer
and lecturer on aging issues. ``Let's look at what's really going
on and picture (older adults) as they are, not as bad or
indifferent.''
</P>
<P>
   Certain images of older adults dominate: the senile, perverted
old man or the sweet, cookie-baking grandmother, for example.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we have to watch out for is when we use stereotypes
instead of reality,'' said Barbara Payne-Stencile, founder of the
gerontology department at the University of Georgia. ``All older
people are not alike, (the media needs to) show their differences,
that they are both good and bad. Don't make them all senile or
always have Alzheimer's.''

   &UR; Lillie Hitchcock Coit &LR; , the San Franciscan renowned in the
Victorian era for her passion for watching fires, smoking cigars,
drinking bourbon, playing poker and, on occasion, getting all

   Coit, born at West Point, came to San Francisco when she was 8
in 1851. She grew up here and in Paris, married  &UR; Benjamin Howard &LR;

   When she died in 1929, part of her legacy to San Francisco was
used to build Coit Tower on Telegraph Hill. Her recipes _ from

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PLACERVILLE, Calif. _ It has been 22 years since a young
pediatrician named Earl Washburn III hung his shingle in this
rustic old gold-mining town in the foothills of the Sierras. There
were no pediatricians in Placerville back then; with fewer than
7,000 people, there was not even a McDonald's.
</P>
<P>
   But the town, with its towering pines and firs, charming
turn-of-the-century cottages and proximity to the state capital,
Sacramento, seemed a fine place to set up practice and raise a
family. And Washburn, fresh out of residency with a wife and
15-month-old son, had very definite ideas on how to do both.
</P>
<P>
   Antibiotics would not be casually prescribed, especially not to
infants. Immunizations were essential; parents who opposed
vaccination could find another doctor. Prospective partners _ there
are now four partners and one associate in the El Dorado Pediatrics
Medical Group _ were told they would not get rich, but neither
would they miss their children's soccer games.
</P>
<P>
   The goal, says Dr. Jeffrey Rabinovitz, who joined Washburn in
1977, was this: ``You take care of your patients, and your
family.''
</P>
<P>
   Achieving that goal meant staying independent. But over the last
five years, as managed care has transformed American medicine, the
independence of doctors has often been the first thing to go.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, 92 percent of the nation's physicians had some type
of managed-care contract, according to the American Medical
Association. ``Capitated'' contracts, which pay a set fee for each
patient, accounted for one-third of the average doctor's salary.
Five years earlier, capitation was barely a blip on the medical
association's radar screen, so negligible that the organization did
not bother keeping tabs on it.
</P>
<P>
   As the free market has achieved what President Clinton's
ill-fated health-care overhaul proposal could not _ increased
efficiency and lower costs _ doctors have learned to cope with
burdensome paperwork, discounted fees and insurance company
restrictions on the specialists they refer to and the drugs they
prescribe.
</P>
<P>
   But what troubles them most, it seems, are the intangibles that
have been lost. These are the cherished traditions that Washburn
and his colleagues still dream of fulfilling, of building their own
practice on their own terms. Of forging a bond with patients that
lasted through the years, no matter which insurance company paid
the bills.
</P>
<P>
   ``Compare the Marcus Welby type of doctor that existed up until
10 years ago,'' said Dr. Alan Hillman, director of the Center for
Health Policy at the University of Pennsylvania, ``where a doctor
owns his or her own practice, sets his or her own rates, practices
his or her own style of medicine. Now you have doctors subject to
outside management, most doctors being employees of an organization
or highly managed. The loss of autonomy and control is astounding.
The doctors are battered.''
</P>
<P>
   Battered is precisely how Washburn and his colleagues in
Placerville feel. Like doctors across the nation, they have been
swept up in a roiling wave of medical mergers and acquisitions.
Physicians who once had two partners now have 200. Others have sold
their practices outright, trading patient charts for cash payments
and employee status at hospitals, HMOs or ``physician practice
management'' firms. In 1997, the AMA reports, 43 percent of the
nation's physicians _ excluding those in training, federal
employees and those who do not care for patients _ worked for
someone else, up from to 24 percent in 1983.
</P>
<P>
   While the buying and selling frenzy appears to finally be
abating, perhaps nowhere has it been as furious as in the region
surrounding Sacramento. Known as ''the managed care capital of
America'' because 90 percent of all insured people are enrolled in
health maintenance organizations, California's capital city is
''the chaotic extreme of a generally turbulent marketplace,'' said
Dr. James Robinson, professor of health economics at the University
of California at Berkeley.
</P>
<P>
   That turbulence nearly put El Dorado Pediatrics out of business.
Over the past two years, Washburn and his partners have watched as
big medical groups gobbled up smaller practices like their own, and
then fired some doctors while keeping their patients. Resisting
offers to sell, they nonetheless affiliated their practice with one
such company, only to watch it drown in a sea of red ink. When that
firm was sold, Washburn said, the new owner, FPA Medical Management
Inc., stopped payment for patient visits. After five months, the
pediatricians were owed $86,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were desperate,'' he said, ''down to our last 58 cents.''
The dispute was eventually settled, but now Washburn's group has a
new worry: FPA, which administers the Placerville pediatricians'
largest health care contract, accounting for one third of their
patients, filed for bankruptcy July 19.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like some science fiction story, a parallel universe,''
Washburn said, ``where they keep switching you from one universe to
the next with a new set of rules. In about the time you figure out
how to make the universe work, it changes again.''
</P>
<P>
   The tumult has taken its toll. With doctors losing jobs and
patients, there is intense competition for work. Collegiality is
all but gone, said Bill Sandberg, executive director of the
Sacramento-El Dorado Medical Society. ``It's been a bloody war,''
he said. ``All we have had is unpredictability, chaos and crisis.''
</P>
<P>
   Amid the chaos, medicine's elite has learned an ego-bruising
lesson: They could not count on their patients. Given a choice
between loyalty to a longtime doctor and cheaper medical care, the
patient will choose to pay less. Washburn, the pediatrician, has
seen this from both sides; he is recovering from colorectal cancer,
and recently switched primary care physicians because his doctor
left his health plan.
</P>
<P>
   Managed care, he said, worked wonderfully for him; he never even
saw a bill, and estimates he paid no more than $100 for $250,000
worth of medical care. ``But,'' he added, ``everybody who took care
of me lost money on me.''

   &LR;   &LR;   &UR; PETE STARK PROTECTS OUR PRIVATES &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Representative  &UR; Pete Stark &LR; , D-Hayward, has introduced the ``No
Private Contract to Be Negotiated When the Patient is Buck Naked
Act,'' reports the Washington paper Roll Call.
</P>
<P>
   The text says it is intended ``to limit the ability of
physicians to demand more money through private contracts during
periods in which the patient is in an exposed condition.''
</P>
<P>
   If it passes, Health and Human Services Secretary  &UR; Donna &LR; 
 &UR; Shalala  &LR; would be ordered to issue rules prohibiting the discussion
of a contract when ``The patient is buck naked and the doctor is
fully clothed, ... The patient is wearing one of those short,
flimsy little hospital gowns that don't close in the back; at any
time the patient's legs are in a stirrup device.''
</P>
<P>
   Roll Call says that ``maybe a stripped-down version could pass
by the end of the session.''

 PLACERVILLE, Calif.: on me.'' 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The hilly-two lane road that leads to the El Dorado Pediatrics
Medical Group stretches south from California's Route 50, past a
string of auto body shops, the local fruitgrowers association and a
bible church. Washburn and his colleagues work out of a low-slung
stucco building the color of caramel, tucked unobtrusively behind a
split-rail fence.
</P>
<P>
   Inside, the office looks like something out of Norman Rockwell,
with hand-painted murals featuring barnyard scenes and grassy
fields of blue lupine. Washburn is a tall, slender 51-year-old with
big square glasses, a soft-spoken man who reads philosophy in his
spare time.
</P>
<P>
   The story of the Placerville pediatricians' foray into the
high-stakes world of mergers and managed care is a tale of
miscalculations and dashed hopes. It began in 1993, when Foundation
Health Corp., then the second-largest health maintenance
organization in Sacramento, decided to create a separate practice
management company so that it could funnel its own patients to its
own doctors.
</P>
<P>
   The new company quickly bought the practices of 100 Northern
California doctors, most of them primary care physicians, according
to Kurt Davis, a former Foundation Health vice president. At the
same time, it invested millions in building a dozen
state-of-the-art clinics, including one in Placerville, a
25,000-square foot facility with enough space for 12 doctors. '`We
dove in full-blast,'' Davis said. Washburn, meanwhile, gave the new
clinic a nickname: ''the Taj Mahal.''
</P>
<P>
   El Dorado Pediatrics was courted heavily by the new group. At a
time when the price of a doctor's practice was plummeting, Washburn
said, he and his colleagues were offered ``a generous buyout,''
along with salaries of nearly twice what they were earning and a
three-year guarantee that they would not be fired.
</P>
<P>
   To Washburn, it sounded promising. He is not, by his own
account, a wealthy man. He bought a new Subaru this spring, a step
up from his old 1990 Ford Taurus, and said he has never earned more
than $100,000 a year; the average American doctor now earns
$200,000 a year, according to the AMA. At the same time, he was
cautious.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd be delighted to make more money,'' he said. ``There's
always things to spend it on. But in this practice we are very
careful about balancing our social and personal needs with the
needs of making money.''
</P>
<P>
   That means that when a doctor needs time off, as Washburn did
during his cancer treatment, the others pitch in without complaint.
And it means they practice as they see fit. When a mother who
lacked insurance brought her son in for a sprained thumb on a
recent day, Rabinovitz waived the charge. When, that same day,
Washburn evaluated a high-schooler for attention deficit disorder,
he patiently questioned the boy for 60 minutes. ``If we need an
hour,'' said Dr. Ulrich Hacker, another partner, ``we take an
hour.''
</P>
<P>
   A for-profit company, the group worried, would undoubtedly
interfere with that freedom. But when it came to a vote, they split
down the middle. Washburn and Hacker wanted to stay. Rabinovitz and
Dr. Linda Eldred, the fourth partner, wanted to go. In the end,
they decided to decline rather than rather than split up.
</P>
<P>
   What they wound up with seemed even better: a lucrative,
five-year contract in which they became Foundation's first and only
``associate medical practice.'' The agreement called for El Dorado
Pediatrics to see as many patients as Foundation could provide, a
risky proposition, since doctors do not like to depend too heavily
on one health plan. In return, Foundation would pay the doctors 100
percent of what they billed.
</P>
<P>
   In this era of heavily discounted medicine, such an arrangement
was unheard of. But Placerville had just one other pediatrician,
and he was fresh out of training. Foundation needed El Dorado
Pediatrics. ``We were in hog heaven,'' Washburn said.
</P>
<P>
   The euphoria didn't last. Before long, the Foundation medical
group was ``losing just tons of money,'' said Davis, the former
company spokesman. The fancy clinics were expensive to run, the
doctors weren't seeing enough patients to cover the overhead and
health insurance premiums were in a nosedive. ``We didn't read the
tea leaves right,'' Davis admitted.
</P>
<P>
   By early 1996, 26 Foundation doctors had been laid off, losing
their patients as well as their jobs. While Washburn and his
colleagues were counting their blessings that they hadn't sold to
Foundation _ ``one or two of us would have surely been fired,''
Rabinovitz said, in retrospect _ they were owed money by the
sinking firm. Meantime, some of the laid-off doctors came to
Sandberg, the medical society executive, for help finding work.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some were totally devastated,'' Sandberg said. ``Some of them
were crying.''
</P>
<P>
   But Robinson, the health care economist at Berkeley, has little
sympathy for the out-of-work doctors. ``Don't think of these
doctors as poor oppressed proletarians,'' he said. ``These doctors
that sell get rich selling.''
</P>
<P>
   The white knight that rescued _ or appeared to rescue _
Foundation was FPA Medical Management Inc., a San Diego-based
company that until recently was one of the nation's biggest
physician practice management firms. FPA had been snapping up
medical practices across the nation; with 7,900 doctors in 29
states at its peak, it acted as a middleman between doctors and
health plans, negotiating contracts and administering claims. A
publicly-held company, it was making a big splash on Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   In October 1996, FPA paid $220 million for the Foundation
doctors' group, and leased the half-empty medical centers. But when
Washburn attended a meeting where a Foundation executive described
the sale, he felt a little queasy. ``He kept saying, 'We have to
take care of our shareholders,''' the pediatrician said. ``What
about the patients?''

 PLACERVILLE, Calif.: the patients?'' 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The takeover was rocky. Doctors did not like doing business with
FPA; in Tucson, a group of FPA-owned doctors formed a union last
year to fight the company's cost-cutting measures, such as
increasing patient loads and firing specialists. In Sacramento,
some quit amid complaints that they were not paid on time.
</P>
<P>
   But the Placerville pediatricians could not leave; they were not
employees. When FPA took over the contract, Washburn said, he spent
five months trying to collect on $86,000 that was owed. In an
interview in May, Dr. Stephen Dresnick, FPA's president and chief
executive, attributed the dispute, which was eventually resolved,
to ''a mismatch of expectations.'' But in any event, the FPA
executive said, the amount was negligible.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eighty six thousand doesn't sound like a lot of money, does
it?'' Dresnick said, noting the practice has five doctors. ``You're
looking at $16,000 per person. That doesn't strike me as an
extraordinarily high number of outstanding claims.''
</P>
<P>
   They pediatricians take a different view; they gave up six
weeks' salary to make up for the deficit. ``To him it's chump
change,'' Washburn said. ``To us, it's the world. This was our
number one contract. It was one third of our income, and we were
dying.''
</P>
<P>
   Each Wednesday afternoon, the five doctors of El Dorado
Pediatrics Medical Group gather around some folding tables for a
two-hour brown bag lunch and business meeting. The talk runs the
gamut, from medical journal articles to bookkeeping matters. In
recent months, it has centered largely on FPA.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, before it became clear that the company was headed
for bankruptcy, Rabinovitz threw out an idea. Perhaps, he
suggested, the group should send a letter to its patients,
informing them its contract with FPA contract was due to expire in
1999, and that the doctors did not plan to renew it. ``What I'm
saying,'' he told his partners that spring day, ``is we cut our
losses. We put ourselves in a position where we could afford to
lose this contract.''
</P>
<P>
   Everyone around the table knew that such a letter could cut both
ways. Patients might try to switch health insurance plans to stick
with the doctors. Then again, as Rabinovitz himself acknowledged,
they might not. ``I'm a firm believer that we always overestimate
patient loyalty,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Today, that dilemma is moot. On July 15, the California
Department of Corporations issued a cease and desist order to FPA,
ordering the company to pay its doctors; the bankruptcy petition
was filed four days later.
</P>
<P>
   While state officials scurried to make certain patient care was
uninterrupted, Dr. Jack Lewin, the director of the California
Medical Association, began tallying the losses. He estimates that
FPA owes $60 million to California doctors. Some of those
physicians, Lewin said, traded their practices for FPA stock, which
hit a high of $40 a share last October but was trading at 25 cents
by July 30. ``Those doctors lost their shirts,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say FPA tried to grow too big too fast. Dresnick, the
FPA executive, vows that the company will emerge, healthy and
revitalized, from its reorganization by the end of the year. But it
is pulling out of Sacramento, he said a recent interview. While the
FPA-employed doctors there are busy affiliating themselves with new
groups, the company is laying plans to dispose of the expensive
clinics, including the one in Placerville.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was losing money every month,'' Dresnick said, ``and so the
decision was, do we put more money into it, or just admit that this
was one we couldn't make work?''
</P>
<P>
   For the pediatricians, that decision is somewhat of a relief.
FPA still owes them $24,000, and they are continuing to see
patients without being paid for their work. ``We assume, if they
filed for bankruptcy, that they are out of our lives,'' Rabinovitz
said. ``But the question is, Who is going to pay us? We will
probably have to stand in line at the bankruptcy hearings.''
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, the doctors will continue to work longer hours,
a practice they began when Washburn became ill, in an effort to
bring in more income. They are trying to persuade patients to
switch their insurance to plans not administered by FPA health
plans. And they are looking to sign more managed care contracts, in
an effort to diversify.
</P>
<P>
   Although they have entertained other offers to sell during the
past two years, it no longer seems like a viable option. Companies
like FPA have come to realize that buying a medical practice may
not be such a good investment; health economists say doctors tend
to work harder when they are self-employed. In any event, the
pediatricians say, they no longer believe they have to join up with
a larger group to survive.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point,'' Washburn said, ``we are not looking to
anybody to come in and be the white knight to protect us or save
us. We are simply going to have to do whatever we do on our own.''
</P>
<P>
   Robinson, the Berkeley health care economist, believes that out
of all this churning will come something good: perhaps not not
universal health care for all Americans, as President Clinton once
envisioned, but at least a system that is cost-efficient.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are re-engineering the health care system,'' he said, ``and
we are doing it the American way, which means incredible
competition. We're going to have a consumer-oriented system, not a
doctor-oriented system.'' The change, he adds, will continue to be
painful for doctors: ``We are seeing supply and demand equilibriate
here at a new lower price, and it is nasty.''
</P>
<P>
   In Placerville, Washburn sees something else in the future of
American health care: complete collapse. He says Clinton squandered
an opportunity to make lasting change, that the time is past when
things can be ''fixed in an orderly fashion,'' and that any system
in which a crucial component _ namely, doctors _ are so demoralized
cannot possibly survive.
</P>
<P>
   Lately, Washburn has been writing philosophical articles for
medical trade magazines. He has just picked the title for his next
one: ``The Coming Medical Apocalypse.''

HATCH URGES CLINTON TO `POUR HIS HEART OUT' 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Utah, Conn., Mass.)  (lb) 
 By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Sen. Orrin Hatch, the chairman of the Senate
Judiciary Committee, said Sunday that President Clinton should
``pour his heart out'' to the American people about his
relationship with Monica Lewinsky, and that by doing so he could
take the steam out of any possible drive to impeach him.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he comes forth and tells it and does it in the right way
and there aren't a lot of other factors to cause the Congress to
say, `This man is unfit for the presidency and should be
impeached,' then I think the president would have a reasonable
chance of getting through this,'' Hatch said on the NBC News
program ``Meet the Press.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the American people would breathe a sigh of relief,''
added Hatch, R-Utah.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats too were beginning to suggest that some sort of public
accounting from the president would be useful, although some
actively asserted Sunday on the talk shows that he had already told
the truth when he denied having ``sexual relations'' with Ms.
Lewinsky, a former White House intern.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the truth, members of Congress said that the Lewinsky
matter, which has preoccupied official Washington since January,
had poisoned the culture.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn., defended the president and said
that everyone wanted to avoid a constitutional crisis, but he added
that the allegations of an affair had besmirched the public
discourse.
</P>
<P>
   ``This episode is sorry, and it is sordid, and it has brought
down not only our government and the head of our government, but
the whole country,'' Lieberman said on the CNN program ``Late
Edition.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I mean, the very fact that I have not been able to
automatically let my young daughter sit with me and watch the news
anymore tells you what has happened here,'' he added. ``And,
honestly, we don't know yet whether we _ about this degradation of
our process and our culture to some extent _ we should blame the
president, Ms. Lewinsky, Ms. Tripp, Judge Starr, or the media, or
all of them to some extent. But the fact is, it's had an effect,
and it's not a good one.''
</P>
<P>
   The comments came as Clinton returned to Washington Sunday from
a weekend of raising money in the Hamptons, in Long Island, N.Y.,
and began to prepare for his Aug. 17 testimony before a grand jury.
The testimony will be broadcast from the White House to grand
jurors, and will be recorded on videotape, the president's attorney
has said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has vigorously denied two sets of allegations, that he
had sexual relations with Ms. Lewinsky, who is now 25, and that he
had urged her to lie about their involvement.
</P>
<P>
   But his agreement last week to testify, after being subpoenaed
by Kenneth Starr, the independent counsel, seems to have emboldened
some here to urge him to be forthcoming.
</P>
<P>
   If Clinton has not been truthful, Hatch said, ``just a mere
apology is not enough here _ he'd have to really pour his heart out
to the American people.'' Hatch even offered an avenue of plausible
explanation for the president _ saying that he lied to protect his
wife and daughter. Going this route, Hatch said, would ``go a long
way'' toward derailing any move to impeach him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he'd be more respected for having done so,'' Hatch
added, ``and I think he could walk away with his head held high.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass., a member of the House Judiciary
Committee, which is where any impeachment investigation would
begin, said he did not presuppose that the president was lying.
</P>
<P>
   But Frank did say that after the president testifies, he should
tell the nation ``at some point'' what he told the grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the timing is a question,'' Frank said on CBS' ``Face
the Nation.'' ``But I do think it would be useful at some point for
him to talk about it.''
</P>
<P>
   George Stephanopoulos, a former top aide to Clinton and now a
commentator on ABC's ``This Week,'' said that it was ``unlikely''
that Clinton would stick to his previous denials.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president is a smart man who cares about his presidency
and he cares about the country,'' Stephanopoulos said. ``And I
think he knows that if there's any chance that he doesn't tell the
full truth to a criminal grand jury, Ken Starr's grand jury, then
the rest of his presidency will be crippled by impeachment
proceedings.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that Democrats on Capitol Hill want Clinton to address
the nation. ``Democrats believe the best thing for him to do right
now is to go forward and tell the story and people will forgive
it.'' He said that Clinton should get a sense on Wednesday, when he
is planning to meet with Democrats on Capitol Hill, about how much
support he has _ ``and it won't be a lot right now.''
</P>
<P>
   William Kristol, editor of the conservative Weekly Standard and
also a commentator on ABC, said that Democrats have already
``signaled to the president they could not support his denial
strategy.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``Every Democrat you talk to outside the White House
orbit says, `Mr. President, mea culpa is the strategy.'''
</P>
<P>
   Also on Sunday, the attorney for Linda Tripp, whose taped phone
conservations with Ms. Lewinsky prompted the investigation, said
that Mrs. Tripp had seen the cocktail dress that lawyers said Ms.
Lewinsky has told prosecutors contains a stain that is evidence of
a sexual encounter with Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``She did see something that appeared to be a stain,'' Anthony
Zaccagnini, the lawyer, said on ``This Week.'' ``What that stain
is, Linda doesn't know. The origin of that stain Linda doesn't
know. Quite frankly, it wasn't something that Linda was quite
gleeful to see.''
</P>
<P>
   The FBI is still examining the stain, a bureau spokeswoman said
Sunday.

WESTERN ENVOYS CALL BULGARIA AN ARMS BAZAAR FOR THE WORLD 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (REPEATING to fix coding)  (jw) 
 By RAYMOND BONNER

<P>
   SOFIA, Bulgaria _ Once the renowned supplier of weapons for the
Soviet Union, this Balkan country has become the arms bazaar for
rebels and terrorist organizations of every political, ethnic and
religious persuasion, Western officials and experts in the small
arms trade say.
</P>
<P>
   Secret weapons shipments have gone to rebel groups forming in
Congo, threatening another outbreak of war there; to rebels in
Angola, who are preparing to take up their war anew there, and to
Eritrea, adding to Washington's fears about the escalation of
fighting in the Horn of Africa. And that is just in the last few
months. Other arms shoppers have included Sri Lanka's Tamil Tigers,
which Washington has labeled a terrorist group, and Rwanda's Hutu
militia, who were responsible for mass killings in Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
   If the Bulgarian arms traffic were shut down or cleaned up, far
fewer weapons would end up fueling today's regional wars,
intelligence and industry experts said.
</P>
<P>
   But Washington and the European Union, while voicing concern,
have done little to stop the trade, diplomats from several nations
said.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, both Europe and the United States have put more
diplomatic muscle into getting the Bulgarian government to shut
down the production of pirate compact disks thanks to pressure from
business groups, diplomats said. By contrast, they noted, there is
no business lobby calling for a crackdown on Bulgaria's arms
makers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't regard it as a subject on which to make a fuss,'' a
Western ambassador said, slightly chagrined.
</P>
<P>
   The big attraction in Bulgaria is the Kalashnikov assault rifle.
Light, durable and easy to maintain, it is ideal for young soldiers
slogging through jungles or trekking up mountains. And Bulgaria
makes the best. Having lost their traditional Cold War markets,
Bulgaria's arms manufacturers are desperate for customers, whom
they have accommodated with false shipping documents to disguise
both the buyer and the destination of the weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Bulgaria's major arms suppliers declined to be interviewed.
Government officials denied that the country has become a major
center for illicit arms trafficking, as American and European
officials maintain.
</P>
<P>
   ``The official government policy is directed at restraining such
activities,'' said Vladimir Tourtansky, a senior official in
Bulgaria's Cabinet-level Council on Defense Industry and Logistics.
</P>
<P>
   Advocates for greater controls on small-arms trade point out
that so-called small arms and light weapons _ assault rifles,
grenades, mortars _ have caused more death and destruction in the
last 50 years than nuclear, biological and chemical weapons, which
are the objects of international alarm and controls.
</P>
<P>
   Bulgaria is not the only place where rebels and rogues shop.
Arms manufacturers in Ukraine, Slovakia, Romania and Belarus are
also major suppliers of weapons.
</P>
<P>
   But at the moment, Bulgarian arms are the weapons of choice.
</P>
<P>
   At the center of the trade are Kintex, the state marketing
agency, and Arsenal, the country's largest arms manufacturer, which
is also state-owned.
</P>
<P>
   Founded by Bulgaria's secret police in the 1960s, Kintex has a
history of dubious arms trading. During the Iran-Iraq war, the
company sold to both sides.
</P>
<P>
   Kintex ``offers so many models of Kalashnikov assault rifles''
that Jane's Infantry Weapons, the industry's authoritative guide,
feels compelled to provide a summary. Altogether, Jane's lists 16
Bulgarian models, from the AKT-47, a training version of the
original AK-47, to the AK-74, the latest version of the assault
rifle, which was designed 50 years ago by Mikhail Kalashnikov for
the Soviet Army.
</P>
<P>
   All are made by Arsenal. Bulgarian officials boast that Mikhail
Kalashnikov has said Arsenal makes the highest quality Kalashnikov
today. The company also manufactures the 9-millimeter Makarov
pistol, which is often in the crates of weapons clandestinely
shipped from here.
</P>
<P>
   Kintex and Arsenal denied several requests for interviews.
</P>
<P>
   Arsenal and Kintex, along with other Bulgarian weapons
companies, are still largely in the hands of the men who ran them
during the communist days. In doing business today, they make use
of the expertise and contacts they developed when Bulgaria handled
Moscow's clients, including Libya, Iraq and Iran, and many African
governments or guerrilla groups.
</P>
<P>
   With the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, Bulgaria lost
these secondary markets, as well as the Warsaw Pact. Struggling to
survive economically has caused the companies to engage in shady
practices, diplomats said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their attitude toward the small arms trade is: We know we
shouldn't but we can't afford not to,'' a European diplomat said.
</P>
<P>
   An Asian diplomat put it this way: ``If you can't sell to the
Soviet Union, if you can't sell to the Warsaw Pact, if you can't
sell to Iran, Iraq, Libya, what do you do?''
</P>
<P>
   ``They need capital,'' he went on. ``So I suppose they don't
look too closely at end-user certificates.'' That refers to the
document that is supposed to identify the ultimate destination of
the weapons.
</P>
<P>
   A few months ago, acting for a British mercenary army, Arsenal
shipped 35 tons of weapons for rebels in Sierre Leone, using
documents that said they were going to Nigeria. In a deal for 77
tons of Kalashnikovs and other weapons, air-dropped to a violent
religious sect in India two years ago, Arsenal used phony documents
saying they were going to the Bangladesh Defense Ministry.
</P>
<P>
   Western and Asian diplomats said that the current Bulgarian
government, which came to power last year, was trying more than
previous post-communist governments to curb shady arms practices,
but that it was constrained by the country's economic needs and the
influence of the military industry.
</P>
<P>
   Tourtansky said he was not aware of any arms company that has
been punished for using false documents. He added, however, that
Bulgaria's arms sales policies ``are in line with all international
standards and norms.'' He stressed that Bulgaria was complying with
the so-called Wassenaar Arrangement.
</P>
<P>
   Pushed by the Clinton administration, the Wassenaar accord _
named after the Dutch city where it was signed three years ago _ is
aimed at controlling exports of conventional weapons and dual-use
goods, like computers and telecommunications equipment, to
countries like Iran, Iraq, Libya and North Korea.
</P>
<P>
   But Wassenaar, with 33 member-nations, does not deal with
illicit trade and does not require reporting sales of Kalashnikovs
and other small arms, American officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The most comprehensive report on arms sales is published
annually by the United Nations. But it covers only heavy weapons,
like tanks and warships. Assault rifles, mortars, rocket launchers
and other light weapons are not included.
</P>
<P>
   International policies like these allow Tourtansky to say
accurately, ``We are not required to report to anyone about our
international sales.''

 &HT;    McGwire spends lost weekend in Atlanta as Braves win again
 &HT;    By Jack Wilkinson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ For all 150,095 customers, the weekend menu never
varied. The house special at the Ted? A Big Mac, with flies(cq).
Batting practice flies, nothing stronger. And all the strikeouts
you could stomach.
</P>
<P>
   On the road to Roger Maris and history, Mark McGwire ran into a
familiar, frustrating roadblock. ``Somebody's gonna pay for what
happened here,'' a relieved Bobby Cox said Sunday after the
Braves's 4-3 win over the Cardinals. For the third straight game,
McGwire went not only hitless but deep-less(cq) in Atlanta. He was
0-for-4, striking out his last three at-bats. That left McGwire
0-for-11 for the weekend with seven strikeouts, and stuck on 45
home runs.
</P>
<P>
   Including two games here last August, when McGwire was 1-for-8
with a single and five strikeouts, he's 1-for-19 at the Ted with 12
strikeouts and no homers. In those five games, he hit just five
fair balls; only three were out of the infield, all last year. The
only time he reached base this weekend was Friday when Greg Maddux,
with the count 3-0 and a runner on second base, intentionally
walked McGwire.
</P>
<P>
   ``We tried to go with our normal stuff and hit our spots,'' Cox
said of facing McGwire, who attracted another 49,296 fans Sunday as
Atlanta set a three-game franchise attendance record. ``If you
don't, you know the ball's gonna go bye-bye. You know luck's on
your side when you hold him down.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I just wanted to go out and be aggressive,'' said Kevin
Millwood, who struck out eight (McGwire twice) in seven innings and
raised his record to 12-6. ``Whether he breaks out of his slump, or
whatever they call it, I just tried to go right at him.''
</P>
<P>
   And not peak(cq). On May 14 in St. Louis, Millwood gave up an
opposite-field homer to McGwire. ``He looked like a monster,''
recalled Millwood, who first faced McGwire in spring training.
``You see the guy on TV, you can tell he's a big guy. When he
stands up at the plate, he makes Javy (Lopez) look small standing
there. It's nervewracking. But you've still got to do what you can
to get him out. You try not to look at him while you pitch to
him.''
</P>
<P>
   Millwood got McGwire to ground out in the first inning. With the
Braves infield shifted, second baseman Keith Lockhart fielded
McGwire's grounder on the left side of the infield and threw him
out. Millwood opened the fourth by fanning McGwire on a curveball
in the dirt, then threw a fastball by him to end the fifth.
</P>
<P>
   ``You never know what he's gonna do,'' Cox said of McGwire. ``He
might hit two to seven homers in a series, especially in the
daytime. We feel fortunate to get out of here with zero.''
</P>
<P>
   Rudy Seanez, who struck out McGwire in relief in the eighth
inning Saturday, did so again Sunday. By then, the Braves had
scored three runs after Card shortstop Luis Ordaz's two-out error
in the fifth was followed by RBI hits by Lopez, Greg Colbrunn and
Ryan Klesko. When Kerry Ligtenberg pitched a perfect ninth for his
16th save, Atlanta again had dodged a large, red-headed bullet.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was pretty amazing how we were able to pitch to him,''
Millwood said of McGwire, now 0-for-15 and in a 4-for-41 slump.
``It's tough to shut him down for three days.''

 &HT;    More success on field than off
 &HT;    By Karen Rosen
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The curtain fell on the 1998 Goodwill Games Sunday
after 15 days of competition punctuated by star performances,
political statements and an unforeseen tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   It was only fitting that the man who unintentionally made it all
happen played a role, too.
</P>
<P>
   Former president Jimmy Carter presented the figure skating
medals Saturday night, then was whisked to the boxing arena for
more ceremonies, handshaking and general goodwill.
</P>
<P>
   If not for Carter's decision to boycott the 1980 Olympics in
Moscow _ and the Soviet Union's retaliatory boycott in Los Angeles
four years later _ Ted Turner never would have seen fit to create
his Games designed to promote peace in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   Twelve years later, more than $5 million in prize money and
performance incentives attracted 1,500 athletes from 67 countries
to New York for an event that some rank just below the Olympics and
World Championships for Olympic-style competition.
</P>
<P>
   Goodwill Games president Mike Plant, in pronouncing this edition
a success, said one of his colleagues at TBS told him, ``It's the
first time people have felt really proud that the Games are a
property that we own.''
</P>
<P>
   But no one's calling them a cash cow. Plant refused to discuss
losses _ ``We always use the word investment,'' he said of an event
that lost a combined $109 million in its three previous
incarnations. Time Warner's policy is not to divulge numbers, Plant
said, but added, ``We still believe that at the end of the day,
this will be the most financially successful Games.''
</P>
<P>
   The Games only had to pay out a $100,000 bonus for one world
record _ Michael Johnson and teammates on the men's 1,600-meter
relay _ and insurance is paying the medical care for paralyzed
Chinese gymnast Sang Lan.
</P>
<P>
   Promotional fees to athletes such as Johnson, Dan O'Brien,
Jackie Joyner-Kersee and Michelle Kwan paid off with gold medals
and with interest _ from members of the public who usually snap to
attention only during the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the biggest benefactors were the Boys and Girls Clubs of
America, which received $2 million from proceeds and a $25 million
gift from Dan and Merlene Phillips of Dallas-based First Plus
Financial. UNICEF also received $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   Several sponsors, Plant said, have already asked about renewals,
``which is a big first for these Games.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials expect final TV ratings on TBS to average about 1.7
(nearly 1.3 million households).
</P>
<P>
   ``Our partners are really happy,'' said Greg Hughes, Turner
Sports vice president of public relations. ``Put it in context _
the Braves do a 1.7, the NBA regular season games do roughly a 1.7.
For 15 nights, three hours a night, it's a solid performance.''
</P>
<P>
   Spectators in the seats were a different story. Plant said he
was pleased with the number of tickets distributed in a tough
market: 350,000 from an available total of about 460,000 (not
including the unused upper deck at Madison Square Garden). Of that
number, about two-thirds were sold and the rest went to charity and
sponsors. By comparison, 780,000 tickets were sold at the 1990
Games in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   There were no operational nightmares of the kind that plagued
St. Petersburg, Russia, four years ago, such as green water in the
pool and early lack of ice at the skating rink. Journalists, who
criticized some operations of the Atlanta Olympics, were frustrated
here by the transportation system and erratic news conference
schedule, but found no fault with the reporting of results.
</P>
<P>
   Now that they've played to the busiest city in the world, would
the Goodwill Games ever consider a trip to Atlanta, which has
experience hosting an event of this nature?
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll see,'' said Turner Sports president Harvey Schiller.
``We're going to consider any city in the world. Certainly Atlanta
has the venues _ they can build a new track _ and the public
support.''
</P>
<P>
   And Jimmy Carter wouldn't have to travel so far.

   Another curse of the scorching heat - a jump in grasshopper
population
</P>
<P>
   By Dick Stanley and Pamela Coleman
</P>
<P>
   C. 1998 Cox News Service
</P>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ With the relentless heat and drought come . . .
the grasshoppers.
</P>
<P>
   Texas has more than 150 species of the little critters. Some of
them, hatched when their eggs escaped a normal drowning from the
rains that didn't come in April and May, have been chewing their
way through Central Texas crop and pasture land since June.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with many of those areas stripped clean by thousands of the
bugs or by the drought, some of the remaining hoppers are moving
into the suburbs, where tasty vegetable and flower gardens await.
</P>
<P>
   The plague isn't of biblical proportions, because only one
generation of grasshoppers is involved. But it's enough to reduce
affected gardeners to tears.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're stripping gardens here and there,'' said John
Dromgoole, host of an Austin radio gardening show and owner of the
Gardenville nursery in southwest Travis County. ``The mockingbirds
are gorged with them. There aren't enough natural predators to keep
them in check.''
</P>
<P>
   The closer a garden is to the edge of a town, the greater the
risk of grasshopper infestation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The countryside is infested with them,'' Dromgoole said. ``We
walk through the fields out here, and they jump all over the
place.''
</P>
<P>
   In Bastrop County, east of Austin, Gary Rassner, a Bastrop
dentist and organic gardener, said the grasshopper population is
the largest he's seen in 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got trees protecting my garden site,'' he said. ``It's
worse out in the open.''
</P>
<P>
   Ask Donald Sybert, whose family has been farming wheat, corn and
cotton on the same land near Jarrell in Williamson County for more
than a century. This summer reminds Sybert of the mid-1950s, when a
record drought and swarms of grasshoppers ravaged the area.
</P>
<P>
   ``They take over and defoliate everything,'' Sybert said.
``They've stripped the leaves completely from the corn crop and
left a stick there with an ear of corn on it.''
</P>
<P>
   Corn, sorghum and cotton have been hurt by the grasshoppers, but
the problem, at least for farmers, seems to be abating, said Cliff
Hoelscher, an entomologist with the Texas Agricultural Extension
Service of Texas A&AMP;M University.
</P>
<P>
   Farmers in Central Texas ``have had a tough time in the last
three weeks,'' Hoelscher said. ``But in the last seven to 10 days
we've been seeing lower (grasshopper) populations. Some pockets
still exist, but it's not as widespread as it was six to eight
weeks ago. The continued dry weather is tough on the grasshoppers
like it is on everything else.'' The plague could continue into the
fall unless a hard rain kills the eggs of two common species of
grasshopper, which normally hatch in September.
</P>
<P>
   ``No rain and we'll have a fall population,'' Hoelscher said,
``but it's usually smaller than the spring ones.''
</P>
<P>
   The drought that brought the grasshopper plague has helped cut
down on some insect pests. Mosquitoes are less prevalent than
usual, as are fire ants.
</P>
<P>
   Hoelscher recommends combating grasshoppers in lawns and gardens
with the insecticides Sevin, malathion and diazinon. The Sevin xlr
formulation, he said, works particularly fast when put out in
little clumps mixed with bran flakes and molasses.
</P>
<P>
   ``It won't bother pets,'' he said. ``It's very safe.''
</P>
<P>
   Rassner, Dromgoole and others, however, caution against relying
on insecticides because of the indiscriminate damage they do.
</P>
<P>
   ``Spraying malathion,'' Dromgoole said, ``kills all the lady
bugs, the geckos, the other lizards and our toad population. So you
don't only take down the grasshoppers.''
</P>
<P>
   While many gardeners have been putting out a disease-causing
protozoa specific to grasshoppers that is commonly known as nolo,
the remedy can take up to three weeks to be effective.
</P>
<P>
   Dromgoole recommends a speedier, old-fashioned idea: flour.
</P>
<P>
   ``You dust it onto the plants being consumed,'' he said. ``The
grasshoppers get a mouthful of flour and no longer can chew.''
</P>
<P>
   Or you could take the advice of veteran farmer Sybert and resign
yourself to the inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can spray,'' Sybert said. ``But as many as there are,
you're just wasting your time. It's just part of the gamble. When
Mother Nature works against you, there's little you can do about
it.''
</P>

American-Statesman, Austin, Texas.

<TEXT>
<P>
   East
</P>
<P>
   _ Records: Braves 5-2 (74-38), Mets 4-2 (58-50), Expos 3-3
(43-68), Phillies 1-5 (55-54), Marlins 1-6 (39-73).
</P>
<P>
   _ Final interleague records: Mets 9-7, Braves 9-7, Marlins 8-8,
Phillies 7-9, Expos 6-10.
</P>
<P>
   _ Wildcard hunt: Mets 3 games back, Phillies 6 1/2 games back.
</P>
<P>
   _ The big story: The Braves remained quiet before the trading
deadline while the Mets picked up 15-game loser Willie Blair and
another catcher (Jorge Fabergas). Also, they acquired the troubled
Tony Phillips.
</P>
<P>
   _ The hot bats: Mets first baseman John Olerud is hitting .340.
The highest batting average in team history is .340 by Cleon Jones
in 1969.
</P>
<P>
   _ The big arms: Greg Maddux and Tom Glavine combined to shut
down Mark McGwire, who went 0-for-7 against perhaps the two best
pitchers and didn't get a ball out of the infield. Then McGwire
went 0-for-4 against Kevin Millwood on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   _ The unexpected: Mets catcher Mike Piazza is 1-for-12 against
his former Dodger teammates.
</P>
<P>
   _ The injuries: Montreal's F.P. Santangelo returned to the club
Friday after being on the disabled list with a bruised knee and
then was hit by pitched on his first to at-bats. However, he

   _ The scoop: The Braves made a hard run at Royals closer Jeff
Montgomery but didn't want to give up any of their top prospects
such as Bruce Chen and George Lombard.

</P>
<P>
   _ The big story: Houston pulled off the biggest deal of the
season, getting Randy Johnson from the Mariners and he paid off
quickly by winning Sundat. The Cubs picked up reliever Felix
Heredia which should certainly help their bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   _ The hot bats: Cubs outfielder Sammy Sosa hit grand slams on
two consecutive nights. It was the first two slams of his career,
coming after 246 career homers.
</P>

his right thumb and may miss the rest of the season.

 &HT;    SEC coaches short on experienced QBs
 &HT;    (EDS: Runs with SEC-CHART)
 &HT;    By Tony Barnhart
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Putting an inexperienced quarterback on the field
means holding your breath on every single play. That's why most of
the SEC's 12 head coaches will spend the 1998 season waiting to
exhale.
</P>
<P>
   Only three teams _ Kentucky, LSU, and Arkansas _ enter this
season with proven veteran quarterbacks. The rest are dealing with
question marks at the position that stem from injury, inexperience
or both.
</P>
<P>
   Kentucky has junior Tim Couch, the Heisman Trophy candidate who
threw for 3,884 yards and 37 touchdowns last season. LSU has senior
Herb Tyler, who showed flashes of brilliance last season. Arkansas
junior Clint Stoerner set a school record last season 2,347 yards
passing.
</P>
<P>
   The other schools will each have a quarterback mini-drama that
will begin with preseason practice and play out over course of the
season. A quick look at each:
</P>
<P>
   ALABAMA: Senior John David Phillips, who has thrown exactly 10
career passes, is competing with redshirt freshman Andrew Zow and
incoming freshman Tyler Watts. Watts, a SuperPrep All-American, is
the Crimson Tide's quarterback of the future but many fans believe
Alabama's future is now. Watts will get a chance to win the job as
Alabama continues to install a new passing offense.
</P>
<P>
   AUBURN: Sophomore Ben Leard of Hartwell, Ga., threw only two
passes as a backup last season to Dameyune Craig. Leard will direct
a more conservative offense built around the running game. ''We're
not going to rely on Ben to win the game like we did with
Dameyune,'' said Auburn coach Terry Bowden. ''His job is to keep us
from losing the game.''
</P>
<P>
   FLORIDA: Junior Doug Johnson, who was in and out of coach Steve
Spurrier's dog house last season, is still recovering from shoulder
surgery. If Johnson is healthy, he'll compete with sophomore Jesse
Palmer, who is talented but has yet to prove it on the field.
Spurrier, unlike many Gator fans, is not worried. ''One of those
guys will step up and if he doesn't, we may have to play both of
them,'' said Spurrier. ''Hopefully, we'll be able to fling it
around as much as we want to.''
</P>
<P>
   GEORGIA: Mike Bobo, the SEC's most efficient passer in 1997, is
gone. Jon England (five career passes) and sophomore Mike Usry
(seven passes) have the most experience. Former Parade All-American
Quincy Carter, who has been out of football for two years, may
eventually be the guy but he's got to learn the offense. Incoming
freshman Nate Hybl is extremely talented and confident after
enrolling last spring. Redshirt freshman Daniel Cobb will compete
if he recovers from shoulder surgery. ''We're going to be very
talented there (at quarterback),'' said Georgia coach Jim Donnan.
''We just have to wait and see.''
</P>
<P>
   MISSISSIPPI: Two years ago Romaro Miller was one of the nation's
most highly-recruited quarterbacks after throwing 127 touchdown
passes in high school. He threw only 11 passes as a true freshman
because Ole Miss was involved in so many close games. But the
talent is there. ''He's a guy who will make you miss,'' said coach
Tommy Tuberville. ''We just have to put him in situations where he
has a chance to be successful.''
</P>
<P>
   MISSISSIPPI STATE: Junior Matt Wyatt had six touchdown passes
and 15 interceptions last season and is being pushed for the job by
a host of players, including junior Rob Morgan, redshirt freshman
Wayne Madkins and junior college transfer Kelvin Love. The Bulldogs
were third in rushing offense (158.91 ypg) but 10th in total
offense (314.55 ypg) in the SEC last season. The reason? Lack of
production at quarterback. Wyatt is definitely looking over his
shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   SOUTH CAROLINA: Anthony Wright had thrown for 1,685 yards and 18
touchdowns last season when he suffered a severe knee injury in the
ninth game against Tennessee. Wright participated only in passing
drills during the spring, and his role will be changed now that the
Gamecocks are going to a more run-oriented offense. How Wright will
respond is anyone's guess.
</P>
<P>
   TENNESSEE: Junior Tee Martin threw only 12 passes as a backup to
Peyton Manning, but the job was his on the first day of spring
practice. Martin, from Mobile, got a huge shot of confidence when
he drove the team 80 yards for a late touchdown against Nebraska in
the Orange Bowl. Insiders at Tennessee say the Volunteer offense
won't miss a beat with Martin in control. If anything, it will be
more versatile. ''Tee is further along than most players in his
situation,'' said coach Phillip Fulmer. ''We won't treat him with
kid gloves.''
</P>
<P>
   VANDERBILT: When the freshmen report, Vanderbilt will have six
quarterbacks on scholarship. None of them have ever played a down
of college football but junior Hi Lewis has the inside track. To
complicate matters, Vanderbilt is also installing a brand new
passing offense under first-year coordinator Steve Crosby. ''We're
supposed to have pretty smart guys at Vanderbilt,'' said coach
Woody Widenhofer. ''I guess we'll find out.''
</P>
<P>
   So with all this inexperience at quarterback, what's the bottom
line for the 1998 season? Several coaches said the SEC, which had
seven quarterbacks throw for more than 2,000 yards last season,
will be more run-oriented. Beyond that, it will certainly make for
a most unpredictable year.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think you'll see more upsets this year because there will be
more mistakes,'' said Tuberville of Ole Miss. ''They will play some
great games and they will play some poor games. They are going to
scare some people to death. It's going to be very interesting.''

IF LASORDA IS RIGHT, WATCH OUT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TOM HOFFARTH  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Trader Tommy will be insufferable if the Dodgers
make the playoffs in a couple of months.
</P>
<P>
   No one believed me, he'll bellow. I told you so.
</P>
<P>
   So you did.
</P>
<P>
   By exporting from San Antonio and Albuquerque to import
big-league experience _ something Fearful Freddy Claire cringed at
_ Lasorda has actually brought some sanity to an insane season.
</P>
<P>
   It was Vin Scully, of all people, wondering out loud on the
Dodgers TV broadcast the other night whether Lasorda is really a
general manager thinking like a manager as he continues to bail
water from the sinking season.
</P>
<P>
   Of course he is. Buy now, pay later. It's the American way.
Besides, there's a good chance Lasorda won't be around to take the
heat if these deals don't work out.
</P>
<P>
   There was a definite lack of flair in Claire, who recently set
up a new office in Pasadena and is waiting by the phone to see if
anyone needs a new GM.
</P>
<P>
   Just as there's a definite sorta order brought by Lasorda....
</P>
<P>
   Lasorda insists he's the interim GM and he wants to bring
someone else in who ``is young and knowledgeable and I can work
with.'' And deflect blame if something goes wrong....
</P>
<P>
   Marty Noble, the senior writer on the Mets' beat for New York's
Newsday, has been telling colleagues: ``I have seven words. If I
can verify Bobby Valentine said them, I can get Bobby Valentine
fired.'' Would those words be: ``Please, Tommy, get me to L.A.
Hurry.''...
</P>
<P>
   You say Grudzielanek, I see Grabarkewitz....
</P>
<P>
   You say Carlos Perez, I see Pascual Perez....
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers remain one of two teams that haven't won four in a
row this year....
</P>
<P>
   Matt Franco, the Mets infielder from Westlake High who ruined
the Dodgers' night Saturday with a pinch-hit, ninth-inning home
run, is the nephew of actor Kurt Russell....
</P>
<P>
   Wilton Guerrero just found out from his brother, Vladimir, that
the price of cork is higher in Canada....
</P>
<P>
   For old times' sake, let the highlight of Saturday's ``Hollywood
Stars Night'' be Charlton Heston blazing through the Dodger Stadium
field-level seats on a motorcycle, just like he did in ``The Omega
Man.''...
</P>
<P>
   After the way the Angels fumbled the opportunity to pick up Mark
McGwire at the trading deadline last year, what's so surprising
about the fact the AL West leaders did nothing this time while
Texas changed the entire complexion of its team?...
</P>
<P>
   The NBA labor talks are... sorry, I had to yawn there... are
supposed to resume Thursday, two months before the camps open....
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it's laying the groundwork for the ``Home Team, Fox
Attitude'' gang doing some Lancaster JetHawks games down the road.
Maybe it's not. But Fox Sports West 2's experiment tonight by
airing a Triple-A contest between Las Vegas and Albuquerque at 6
could open the door to more televised minor-league baseball....
</P>
<P>
   Take Sept. 9 in Cincinnati off Dennis Reyes in the Mark McGwire
home run pool....
</P>
<P>
   Howie Long's next movie: ``A Dollar For the Dead,'' made for
TNT. It's a Western with Emilio Estevez and William Forsythe coming
out in October....
</P>
<P>
   Brian Robbins and Mike Tollin, the executive producers of the
HBO drama series ``Arli$$,'' are wrapping up a movie called
``Varsity Blues,'' due out in the fall. Jon Voight plays an
overbearing high school football coach who thrusts backup QB James
Van Der Beek (Dawson from ``Dawson's Creek'') into the
spotlight....
</P>
<P>
   Justin Fargas alert: One-on-One Sports, with its AM-1540
affiliate in L.A., signed to do University of Michigan football
games this season....
</P>
<P>
   L.A. investment groups are being assembled !ital!as we speak in
an attempt to make an offer to buy the San Francisco 49ers, which
could be soon sold by Eddie DeBartolo because of his legal
troubles, reports the San Francisco Chronicle....
</P>
<P>
   So what !ital!is up with Quincy Watts?...
</P>
<P>
   The Raiders have about 5,000 seat license holders who haven't
renewed, which could bring the total who forfeited their PSLs to
12,000....
</P>
<P>
   Lynx Golf, which Fred Couples talked TV celebs like Jim Nantz
and Jim Lampley into investing in last year, has filed for
bankruptcy....
</P>
<P>
   The Tampa Bay Lightning's new offseason ad campaign ends with
the tag: ``No more excuses, it's time to just shut up and play
hockey.''...
</P>
<P>
   Sponsorship update: That Kentucky Derby prep race that used to
be known as the Jim Beam Stakes has been changed to the Gallery
Furniture.com Stakes.... &QL;

</P>
<P>
   _ The hot bats: Orioles outfielder Eric Davis has a 20-game
hitting streak, a career high.

to steal 30 bases and hit 30 homers during the same season.

win. He is 8-0 in 13 home starts in his first season with the A's.

SOUTH ASIANS LAMENT ECONOMIC RIFTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By JOHN F. BURNS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka _ When the seven nations of South Asia held a
summit meeting in Sri Lanka last week, their leaders engaged in
what has become an annual lament, acknowledging that the region has
been an economic backwater for decades. Ending their three-day
meeting on Friday, they vowed, as they have at such meetings for
years, to hasten efforts to break down economic barriers among
them.
</P>
<P>
   But as they headed home, the leaders were faced with a barrage
of skepticism. Throughout India, Pakistan and Bangladesh _ the
three large nations in the group _ and Bhutan, Nepal, Sri Lanka and
the Maldives, critics have despaired of ending the suspicions and
enmities that have blocked economic ties that could help lift their
people out of poverty.
</P>
<P>
   This time the disappointments had a ready focus in the failure
of India and Pakistan to agree on resuming talks aimed at bridging
the region's largest rift.
</P>
<P>
   The two nations demonstrated again, after several rounds of
abrasive talks about talks, how difficult they have found it to
reconcile themselves to the bitter events of 50 years ago, when
Hindus and Muslims _ unable to agree on terms for living together _
opted to carve separate countries out of what had been British
India.
</P>
<P>
   What was to have been the crowning event of the summit meeting,
a handshake sealing an agreement on new talks, became a moment for
the two governments to exchange old grievances over Kashmir, the
territory divided between them at the partition of the subcontinent
in 1947.
</P>
<P>
   India's prime minister, Atal Behari Vajpayee, accused Pakistan
of engaging in ``fantasies'' and ``propaganda'' over Kashmir;
Pakistan's prime minister, Mohammed Nawaz Sharif, said India's
refusal to make Kashmir the priority issue in talks meant that the
two leaders were ``wasting each other's time.'' The meeting closed
with a sense of failure.
</P>
<P>
   Among other things, the standoff appeared to mean that India and
Pakistan will not hold early discussions on ways of lessening the
risk of a nuclear war, the issue that dominated discussion in the
corridors of the summit meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Because of a stipulation in the regional group's charter that
precludes discussion of politically divisive issues between member
states, the nuclear tests conducted by India and Pakistan in May
were not on the agenda and were not mentioned in the concluding
communique.
</P>
<P>
   Vajpayee set the pattern with a speech that mentioned the
nuclear tests only obliquely, referring to them as ``recent events
in South Asia,'' and then only to say that there was no reason for
the tests to impede new regional economic ties.
</P>
<P>
   President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga of Sri Lanka, the
meeting's host, held to the protocol forbidding discussion of
contentious issues, but made her own feelings clear. Calling for an
``ambiance of confidence'' in the region, she added, ``It cannot be
denied that such an ambiance could be affected by recent
developments.''
</P>
<P>
   A leading Sri Lanka newspaper, The Island, captured the gloomy
mood of the group, the South Asian Association for Regional
Cooperation, with an editorial on Sunday headed, ``SAARC at a Dead
End.'' ``Ten years of summitry has not brought any tangible results
to the billion people of the region,'' the editorial said, adding
that if political hostilities continue to thwart economic
co-operation, the organization's reason to exist ``is in
question.''
</P>
<P>
   Some optimists said that even if the meeting did go aground over
the hostilities between India and Pakistan, it had served a purpose
in underlining the region's dismal economic state.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Several of the leaders noted that the region, with a combined
population of 1.3 billion people, has the world's largest
concentration of poverty. According to figures quoted here, at
least 40 percent of the region's people live without adequate
shelter, food, education, medical care or even safe drinking water.
</P>
<P>
   Of the nations that attended the summit, only the Maldives, with
a thriving tourist industry, has a per capita income as high as
$500 a year.
</P>
<P>
   The point was made forcefully by Vajpayee, on his first trip
outside India since becoming the country's leader after elections
in March. ``We represent great civilizations, ancient yet vibrant
and alive, and yet we are among the poorest in the world,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   He made a plea for change: ``Enough of sterile ideology. Enough
of hostile nationalism. Enough of conflict on the basis of religion
and creed. Enough of poverty and backwardness. Let us grow rich
together.''
</P>
<P>
   For many years, India was considered the obstacle to closer
regional ties. But at the Colombo meeting, India led the way in
pushing for lowering trade barriers, announcing that it would
eliminate restrictions that have severely limited imports from its
neighbors of more than 2,000 products.
</P>
<P>
   The seven nations also renewed their commitment to establish a
South Asian free trade area by the year 2001, but many participants
seemed doubtful that the goal could be met. A preferential trading
area, under which each member state agreed to make concessions to
the others not available to other nations, has been bogged down in
red tape since it was established in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   According to Indian statistics, only 3.7 percent of the region's
total foreign trade of about $140 billion is from trade among the
South Asian nations, which trade primarily with Japan, Europe and
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   As an example of the dysfunctional economic arrangements in the
region, others at the meeting noted that Pakistan imports iron ore
from Australia, Canada and Brazil, while India has a surplus that
it exports to Japan. Other examples abounded.
</P>
<P>
   Privately, officials attending the meeting acknowledged that
achieving economic momentum among their countries is unlikely until
political tensions abate.

ANGELS DODGING THEIR PAST
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB KEISSER  
 c.1998 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Los Angeles Angels have never been in a better posi ...
oops, sorry.
</P>
<P>
   In their 37th year, the California Angel are ... darn, let's try
that again.
</P>
<P>
   The Anaheim Angels have been around now for 37 years, and they
have never had a better opportunity to seize the attention of
Southern California's baseball fans.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers, once the most stable franchise in all of sports,
are in virtual chaos, players and front office personnel coming and
going like Metro Rail commuters. They have exchanged their
tradition for the privilege of becoming just another team that
always writes its roster in pencil.
</P>
<P>
   It's never been like this. The Dodgers arrived with a tradition
intact in 1958, won a World Series in 1959, opened a gorgeous
stadium in 1962 and swept the Yankees in the World Series in 1963,
establishing in six short years the foundation of a team that can
draw three million fans a season on spec.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels? They've lingered in the Dodgers' shadow since their
birth. They played in a minor-league park their first season
(1961), became stepchild tenants of the Dodgers in 1962, and moved
to sleepy Anaheim in 1966. They've had three different names (L.A.,
California, Anaheim), once had an obsessive-compulsive free-agent
disorder, have played in three different versions of the same park,
and are still looking to play in their first World Series.
</P>
<P>
   All that noted, there are signs that the franchise is coming out
of the darkness, and not just because the Dodgers are in turmoil.
</P>
<P>
   The Disney folk may not appreciate the analogy, but the Angels
are in many ways out-Dodgering the Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   First, there's the stadium. Disney spared little in turning the
park into a stand-alone attraction, every bit as comfy and cool as
Camden Yards and Jacobs Field. With Fox in charge, who knows what
Dodger Stadium will look like in three years?
</P>
<P>
   There's player stability. Garret Anderson, Gary DiSarcina, Jim
Edmonds, Darin Erstad and Tim Salmon are all signed through 1999.
That quintet plus rookie Troy Glaus represents two-thirds of the
everyday lineup. Troy Percival also is signed through 1999. Six of
those seven players are under 30.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers only have a dozen players left from their
opening-day roster.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the marketing, the Angels' community outreach
program that is both impressive and prolific.
</P>
<P>
   Salmon donates to two different children's-abuse programs and
buys 200 season tickets each year for kids out in the Fish Bowl
(right field pavilion). Erstad donates $50,000 to the Angels Care
program of charities. DiSarcina has worked hands-on with the
Phoenix House, a substance-abuse program for youths, in building an
athletic field.
</P>
<P>
   Percival, a native of Fontana, is helping build youth programs
and facilities in the Inland Empire. Omar Olivares recently hosted
a day at the park for 175 middle schools kids from Santa Ana.
Shigetosi Hasegawa has made several visits to the Japanese-American
Center in Torrance.
</P>
<P>
   Different players visit CHOC every homestand. The Angels put on
a youth clinic once a week; Mark Cresse's school visits Tuesday.
Rod Carew honors the memory of his daughter Michelle by visiting
with cancer survivors. And Percival recently hosted a young child
through the Make A Wish Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're out there,'' said Tim Mead, the Angels' Vice-President
of Communications, who has worked for the organization since 1981
in a variety of areas, including four years as Assistant General
Manager. ``The philosophy is grass roots. We're not looking for a
big kill, but to build a relationship over time. A team can only
win six months a year, but we can work for 12 months.''
</P>
<P>
   All this may be counterpoint to the way the Dodgers have done
things, but the Angels, from the front office to the field, do not
feel they are competing with the Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way people feel about (the Dodgers) in many ways is just
the natural order of things,'' said Mead. ``They have more history,
and they were here first. But we really don't compete against
them.''
</P>
<P>
   The players themselves hardly feel there's a rivalry, even with
interleague play putting them on the same field four times a
season. ``Nobody in this room gives a (bleep) about the Dodgers,''
said Percival after hearing one question too many about the Dodgers
during the interleague series.
</P>
<P>
   So all that's left for the Angels is to win. That has always
been the toughest part for the Angels.
</P>
<P>
   In the first year in the switch from the ``Big A'' to the ``Big
Ed,'' the Angels are averaging 30,302 a game. At that pace, they
will crack the two-million barrier for the first time since 1993
and surpass the 2.4 million the team drew in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   But there's been only five sellouts through 59 games. Two
mentalities persist here. One is that some fans only come out to
see the opponent the Dodgers, Yankees and Red Sox being prime
examples.
</P>
<P>
   A promotion this week in which fans could exchange any Yankee
hat for a new Angels hat backfired badly. DiSarcina, a Boston-area
native, understands this dynamic better than most. He has relatives
living here who only ask for tickets when the Red Sox visit.
</P>
<P>
   ``It bothered me my first few years here,'' said DiSarcina about
invading armies of Yankee fans. ``It left me baffled and confused.
Now I've become immune to it.''
</P>
<P>
   The second mentality is that Angel fans fear the worst and are
on guard against being hurt again. They point to the swoon of '96,
the one-pitch-away nightmare of 1986, and the upchuck of a 2-0 A.L.
lead in 1982 as evidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fans are so programmed to believe the Angels will fold,
and we haven't been able to get over that hump,'' said DiSarcina.
``I meet people and hear things like `We hope you finish strong.'
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing that will stop that is to win a pennant, and
play well after winning a pennant. I think the fans crave it, but
they stay reserved because they don't expect it.''
</P>
<P>
   As of Sunday, the Angels were tied with Texas in the A.L. West
with 52 games to go. If they win the division and play their first
postseason game since 1986, perhaps the fans will reach out.
</P>
<P>
   And perhaps then the Angels could find themselves on the new
ground, meaning the same footing as Team Turmoil up in Elysian
Park.
</P>
<P>
   ``We get tired of that `they let us down' mentality,'' said
Mead. ``But that's the reality. We can reach out a 100 different
ways, but it comes down to winning.''

<P>
   POINT SALINES, Grenada _ Weapons blazing, U.S. troops landed
here nearly 15 years ago and expelled a militarized Cuban
construction brigade that was building an airport at the tip of
this tiny Caribbean island. On Sunday, Fidel Castro returned to the
site of that bitter defeat, but as the recipient of a 21-gun salute
and the cheers of Grenadians.
</P>
<P>
   The Cuban leader, arriving at the third and most controversial
stop of his six-day tour of the English-speaking Caribbean, made
the most of the opportunity to turn the page on what he described
as ``that painful chapter'' of history. He said he was eager to
deepen relations with Grenada, and unveiled a plaque in which
Grenada officially thanked Cuba for the role it played in creating
the airport, which now caters to tourists.
</P>
<P>
   ``We felt that we owe the Cuban people, especially Fidel Castro,
a special sense of gratitude for what he did for Grenada, in the
building of this extremely important facility,'' Prime Minister
Keith Mitchell said to reporters as he waited for Castro, who
arrived from Barbados just before 1:30 p.m., an hour behind
schedule. ``We have not done so officially, and I felt it was time
to set the record straight.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the visit was bitterly criticized by some here,
Mitchell also resorted to traditional Caribbean hospitality for the
man he had described as ``one of the most distinguished and
dedicated leaders of the 20th century.'' As Castro shook hands with
Cabinet members and other local dignitaries, a Grenadian steel band
played a calypso version of the Cuban song ``Guantanamera,'' and
colorful banners proclaiming that Grenada and Cuba are ``friends
forever'' fluttered in the wind.
</P>
<P>
   The mere fact of Castro's landing at Point Salines Airport was
fraught with historical irony. The airport project was begun in
1980, shortly after Prime Minister Maurice Bishop and his New Jewel
Movement took power here and began to cultivate close ties with
Cuba. The alliance and the project quickly aroused the suspicion of
the Reagan administration, which saw it as an attempt by the Soviet
Union and its Cuban proxies to establish a military foothold in the
eastern Caribbean.
</P>
<P>
   Bishop plunged ahead, however, and his relations with the United
States worsened while those with Cuba grew ever warmer. In October
1983, after Bishop was killed in a coup attempt led by a dissident
faction of his own party, the United States intervened militarily,
contending that such a step was necessary to protect the lives of
American medical students studying at a university near the
airport.
</P>
<P>
   During the days of chaos and violence that followed, 19 U.S.
soldiers were killed, along with more than a score of Cubans.
Defying Castro's orders, the rest of the Cuban force eventually
surrendered and returned to Havana in disgrace. Most significant to
the 100,000 residents of this normally relaxed and peaceful island,
an estimated 45 Grenadians also died, opening divisions that remain
at the center of local politics to this day.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In his remarks Sunday, Castro, dressed in his customary military
fatigues, also referred to those events, though more obliquely. He
did not mention the United States or its role in completing the
construction of the airport after the invasion, although a plaque
acknowledging the assistance of the U.S. Agency for International
Development was visible directly behind him. He emphasized instead
the renewal of ties between Cuba and Grenada.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those were sad days when our collaboration was interrupted and
our blood was shed, though it was not fighting each other,'' Castro
said. ``It was not to recount, to launch accusations or to pass
judgment that I accepted Prime Minister Mitchell's friendly
invitation.''
</P>
<P>
   Talking to reporters, Mitchell denied that his move to
strengthen ties with Cuba was a rebuke to the United States, which
has drastically cut its aid and diplomatic presence here in recent
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have consistently said that our initiative to strengthen
ties is not meant as anti-anyone at all,'' he said, before
pointedly adding that, ``I have made it very clear to President
Clinton and all the American officials I have met that the United
States needs to do more for the region.''
</P>
<P>
   The warm official welcome notwithstanding, Castro's visit has
been the source of considerable controversy here. Opponents had
scrawled derogatory graffiti such as ``Castro is a dog'' and ``Cuba
si, Fidel no'' along the main road from the airport to the capital,
where Castro was scheduled to attend a state dinner Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   Some Grenadians maintain that Castro's presence is inappropriate
because it is too closely linked to the political passions and
excesses of the Bishop era. Others see it as a gratuitous slap at
the United States that wins no material or moral benefit for the
country and the Mitchell government.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cuba cannot offer us anything we can use,'' said Lloyd Noel, a
prominent lawyer and newspaper columnist who was the Bishop
government's first attorney general but was later jailed on
political charges. ``There is nothing, and I mean nothing, that we
have to be grateful to Fidel Castro for. What happened in Grenada
between 1979 and 1983 was a direct result of Cuban input.''
</P>
<P>
   More than a dozen figures associated with the group that
overthrew Bishop were tried and convicted after the U.S.
intervention and remain in a prison on a hill overlooking the
capital, some of them serving life terms. ``A sizable minority'' of
the population did not want Castro to come, said Leslie Pierre,
editor of The Grenadian Voice weekly newspaper and himself a former
political prisoner under the Bishop government, because they blame
him for the events of October 1983 and ``can't put the past behind
them.''
</P>
<P>
   In the days leading up to Castro's arrival, Mitchell was forced
to address those concerns and to attempt to distance Castro from
any responsibility for the problems of the Bishop era. In an
address to the nation last Tuesday, he called on Grenadians to
welcome the Cuban leader ``regardless of your political views,''
saying it was necessary to help achieve national reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I understand and empathize with those Grenadians who suffered
during the People's Revolutionary Government regime,'' he said.
``But President Castro or any other foreign leader cannot be held
responsible for the negative aspects of the PRG's leadership. It
must be understood that Grenadians led and executed the
revolution.''

SHEFFIELD TO APPEAL SUSPENSION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Gary Sheffield will meet with National League
president Leonard Coleman today to appeal the three-game suspension
for his part in the June 28 brawl with the Pittsburgh Pirates. But
he is expected to begin serving his punishment tonight in the
series finale against the New York Mets.
</P>
<P>
   Sheffield, who became involved in an altercation with Pirates
catcher Jason Kendall after a near collision at the plate, could
have the suspension cut to two games because he did not provoke the
confrontation.
</P>
<P>
   Kendall elected not to appeal and already has served his
three-game suspension. Sheffield's only defense is Kendall's verbal
abuse after the collision. Both benches cleared and play was halted
for more than five minutes. Sheffield received five stitches over
his left eye after striking his head on Kendall's shin guard during
the brawl.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is never a good time to face a suspension, especially
when you have a guy as hot as Gary,'' manager Glenn Hoffman said.
``So lets get it over with and move on.''
</P>
<P>
   Sheffield went 2 for 3 Sunday with an RBI double. He also scored
a run and is batting .365 with eight RBI in his past 12 games.
</P>
<P>
   Bonilla update:!off Third baseman/left fielder Bobby Bonilla
will test his surgically repaired left wrist today for the first
time since receiving a cortisone shot Friday. Bonilla was eligible
to come off the disabled list Thursday but experienced more pain in
his wrist.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers are hopeful Bonilla can return to the lineup before
the end of the road trip. After today's series finale with the
Mets, the Dodgers play three games in Montreal.
</P>
<P>
   Bonilla has used the time off to also rest his left Achilles
tendon, which required surgery last winter.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there was an upside to this experience it was that the
Achilles also got better,'' Bonilla said. ``It has been tough to
sit out, but I feel I'm getting close.
</P>
<P>
   Where's Beltre: General manager Tom Lasorda, vice president
Ralph Avila and coach Manny Mota brought rookie third baseman
Adrian Beltre into Hoffman's office before the game to send him a
message.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't about his fielding, which still is erratic. It was
about his hitting. After he went 2 for 4 with an RBI double, Beltre
is batting a season-high .225.
</P>
<P>
   Beltre left the team hotel ahead the Dodgers' bus Sunday morning
and arrived at Shea Stadium well after.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just want to make sure how important it is to get to the
ballpark on time,'' Hoffman said. ``He had a brother take him, and
I guess they got lost. Up here, you can't let that happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Quick Hits: Charles Johnson was given the day off after playing
Friday and Saturday night. Tom Prince took his place and went 0 for
3. Prince started Tuesday in Philadelphia when Johnson remained in
Los Angeles while his wife Rhonda gave birth to their first child,
Brandon.

<P>
   DETROIT _ Before jumping into the race for the Democratic
nomination for governor, Geoffrey Fieger was best known as the
lawyer for Jack Kevorkian, the suicide doctor.
</P>
<P>
   Now he is known as a politician who hurls insults like Thor does
his hammer. A millionaire lawyer in a state that prizes the
lunch-bucket ethic, he has never held political office. Worse yet,
he has been seen driving a Swedish-made car on the streets of Motor
City.
</P>
<P>
   And he is winning, much to the horror of the Democratic Party
and leaders of the United Auto Workers.
</P>
<P>
   Fieger, who leads in opinion polls in Tuesday's contest over two
more conventional politicians, Larry Owen and Doug Ross, cannot
wait to throw insults at Gov. John Engler, a Republican.
</P>
<P>
   He has characterized the governor as racist, a moron, a liar,
fat and effeminate. ``Dumber than Dan Quayle and twice as ugly,''
Fieger said about the governor one recent morning, then stopped to
chuckle. A brash populist, Fieger has taken the lead largely by
building support among black voters in Detroit, who like his
irreverent style and unvarnished talk about racism. As a lawyer, he
has won some high-profile civil rights cases. And he talks loudly
and proudly about his father's work as a Freedom Rider in the
segregated South.
</P>
<P>
   ``With his no-holds-barred style, he reminds many
African-Americans of Coleman Young,'' said Mario Morrow, a
political consultant, referring to the first black mayor of
Detroit. ``And Fieger's got this tree-trunk of anger on his
shoulder, which resonates among people who feel disenfranchised by
the system.''
</P>
<P>
   The candidate favored by the autoworkers union, Larry Owen, a
wealthy lawyer and former mayor of East Lansing, has been
desperately trying to court black voters. Earlier this week, he
broke with Michigan tradition and named his running mate for
lieutenant governor, Teola Hunter, a black woman who is clerk of
Wayne County.
</P>
<P>
   Owen has been compared with the former presidential candidate
Walter Mondale, a Democrat who has positions that labor and
liberals find impeccable, but who has little charisma. Political
analysts say it is unclear how the selection of a black running
mate will play: it could win the support of black voters, but it
could also backfire as a transparent political move.
</P>
<P>
   While Fieger leads among blacks in Detroit, Owen has had more
success in the industrial I-75 corridor, which extends north to
Saginaw.
</P>
<P>
   Ross, meanwhile, a former Labor Department official in the
Clinton administration, is known as a pin-striped, businesslike
politician with a voice of moderation. He does best with voters in
the middle-class suburbs of Detroit, and in the western reaches of
the state.
</P>
<P>
   But whomever the Democrats pick on Tuesday, the campaign to
unseat Engler will surely be uphill sledding. Engler, who fits the
socially moderate, pro-business profile that voters in many states
have been choosing as governors in recent years, rides a robust
economy in Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   A decade ago, this state had the highest unemployment rate in
the nation. Now the jobless rate in Michigan ranks among the lowest
of the big states, at least before the recently settled auto
workers' strike.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats will try to make political hay of Engler reneging on
his campaign promise to serve only two terms by running for a
third, but a prosperous economy tends to make voters very
forgiving.

   While polls show that Engler would have a sizable lead against
any of the Democratic candidates, he does best against the
Democratic front-runner, Fieger.
</P>
<P>
   ``John Engler and the Republican Party are licking their chops
waiting for Geoffrey Fieger,'' said Morrow, noting that Fieger's
brash, take-no-prisoners style would seem unlikely to attract the
conservative and moderate voters needed to win a general election.
</P>
<P>
   While Fieger's prominence initially stemmed from his ties to
Kevorkian, the Democratic candidate has kept his distance from the
physician during the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Fieger has focused on the plight of poor Detroiters,
saying he would revitalize the city's neighborhoods by imposing
tariffs on developers who build on open land in the suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   Fieger dropped in at a recent picnic on the shores of the
Detroit River, looking more Hollywood than politician, wearing a
white T-shirt and a blue blazer. He kissed and hugged virtually
every woman at the picnic, and talked hip with teen-agers.
</P>
<P>
   But in an interview moments later, Fieger angrily denounced
Engler in personal terms, questioned the mental health of a Detroit
editorial writer and fairly shouted profanities about a local
political consultant.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is a loose cannon,'' Morrow said. ``The Republicans would
like to portray him as a lunatic, except that he's rich. When
you're rich, you know, you're just eccentric.''

   New Chip-Making Process Is Expected From IBM
</P>
<P>
   IBM is expected to announce Monday that it has perfected a new
manufacturing process to produce semiconductor chips that can
achieve either higher speed or significantly lower power
consumption. The new technique is known as silicon-on-insulator, or
SOI, technology.
</P>
<P>
   This is the third major advance in semiconductor design and
fabrication that IBM has announced in the last year. The company's
top research executives said that the latest advance should give
IBM a one-year to two-year lead in the highly competitive industry.

 &HT;    Braves Notebook: Klesko rediscovers swing after surgery
 &HT;    By Jack Wilkinson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Having lost his appendix, Ryan Klesko is still trying
to rediscover a consistent batting stroke. He took another step in
that direction Sunday, when he was a pain in the, uh, side for St.
Louis.
</P>
<P>
   With Bobby Cox resting Andres Galarraga, Klesko batted cleanup
for just the third time this season and seized the opportunity. He
went 2-for-4 with 2 RBIs in a 4-3 victory over the Cardinals.
Klesko's two-out, opposite-field double in the first inning scored
Keith Lockhart. In the fifth, Klesko capitalized on a two-out error
by shortstop Luis Ordaz.
</P>
<P>
   His single up the middle off Bobby Witt scored Walt Weiss and
tied it at 2-2. After Javy Lopez followed with an RBI single, Greg
Colbrunn (starting at first base for Galarraga) got his first RBI
in his second stint in Atlanta with a double off the base of the
left field wall.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm just trying to get back to where I was before I got
hurt,'' said Klesko, who missed nine games after having his
appendix removed June 29. After going 2-for-4 for the second
straight game, Klesko's 10-for-33 (.303) in his last 11 games with
a homer and seven RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   ''I haven't been consistent since I've come back,'' he said.
''I've been feeling good the last couple of days. I got some good
pitches (Sunday) to hit. And I've worked on some thins with C.J.
(hitting coach Clarence Jones).''
</P>
<P>
   With today's off day, Cox gave Galarraga Sunday off to get two
days' rest. ''To catch his breath,'' said Cox, who also wanted
Colbrunn _reacquired Thursday in a trade with Colorado _ to get
some at-bats. Cox used Galarraga to pinch-hit in the eighth inning,
when he singled. Colbrunn, meanwhile, was 1-for-3 with an RBI
double and was hit by a pitch his first time up.
</P>
<P>
   No word
</P>
<P>
   Neither Cox nor pitcher John Smoltz, tossed Wednesday in
Cincinnati by umpire Hunter Wendelstedt, has heard from the NL
office regarding their controversial ejections. ''But I haven't
been checking my mail,'' Smoltz said, grinning.
</P>
<P>
   But Cox doesn't expect either fines or suspensions from the
incident in which Wendelstedt tossed Smoltz after stepping on his
foot when the pitcher protested a close call at third base.
</P>
<P>
   ''How could there be?'' asked Cox, who came out of the dugout
after Smoltz was ejected. ''I'll accept a fine any time, but nobody
committed anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Wohlers update
</P>
<P>
   Despite not pitching all weekend, Mark Wohlers is encouraged by
several bullpen sessions that may improve his control. Leo
Mazzone's hopeful, too.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've been way too far over the top,'' said Wohlers, who's been
working with a three-quarters motion. ''It started climbing and
climbing, and getting higher and higher. If I think sidearm, I get
to three-quarters, where I should be.''
</P>
<P>
   Three good sessions in succession have Wohlers optimistic he may
finally be able to overcome the wildness. ''For the most part,
there were more consistent pitches thrown hard in the strike
zone,'' he said. ''There have been three really good days in a row
where I've thrown the ball as hard as I could.''
</P>
<P>
   ''He's thrown more strikes with some juice,'' said Mazzone.
''Before, it was less strikes and he wasn't cutting it loose.
(Sunday), he threw harder and hit his target more often. There's
some hope there.
</P>
<P>
   ''Before, when he said, 'I'm OK,' I didn't think he was. Now,
when he says, 'I think I'm getting there,' I think he is.''
</P>
<P>
   Etc. ...
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's sellout crowd of 49,296 gave the Braves a weekend
attendance total of 150,095, a franchise three-game record. The old
mark: 148,095 against Pittsburgh, April 22-24 in Atlanta-Fulton
County Stadium. ... Sunday's game was preceded by the annual Braves
father-children baseball game.

 &HT;    Falcons settled on WR starters, but not backups
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It will be another week before the picture starts
coming into focus with regard to who will make the Atlanta Falcons'
roster, as they approach the preseason opener Friday against
Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   But after a week and a half of training camp, it's a little more
clear at wide receiver. It was a given going in that eight-year
veteran Terance Mathis (5 feet 10, 185 pounds) and nine-year
veteran Tony Martin (6-1, 181) will start.
</P>
<P>
   After that, there's a race between nine other players for three
or four jobs, and perhaps one spot on the practice squad.
</P>
<P>
   Undrafted collegians Corey Allen (6-1, 199) of Georgia and
Octavus Barnes (6-2, 200) of North Carolina remain longshots.
Neither has done much to stand out, partly because they don't get a
lot of opportunities. Van Johnson (6-1, 200), who was cut last
summer from his first training camp with the Giants, likewise
hasn't shown much.
</P>
<P>
   Left to compete for the spots behind Martin and Mathis are
third-round draft choice Jammi German (6-1, 187), fourth-rounder
Tim Dwight (5-8, 181), six-year veteran Todd Kinchen (5-11, 187),
two-year veteran Mercury Hayes (5-11, 195), four-year veteran Keith
Crawford (6-2, 195) and Kevin Thornal (6-2, 186), a member of last
year's practice squad.
</P>
<P>
   Martin replaces Bert Emanuel as the team's chief deep threat,
and he's three inches taller than Emanuel. Receivers coach Rennie
Simmons is surprisingly optimistic about a group that, after Martin
and Mathis, has a total of 100 catches. Kinchen has 84, Crawford 12
and Hayes four.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're bigger and more physical than last year,'' Simmons said.
``We have some guys who have just as much speed. And guys
understand our offense better because some of the guys who were
here ... are able to help teach.''
</P>
<P>
   As high draft choices, Dwight _ expected eventually to be the
team's punt returner _ and German are virtually assured of making
the roster, and they haven't done anything to change the team's
solid impressions of them. That leaves four players competing for
one or two jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, we got a lot of guys that are kind of in a group,
and I don't know if any one guy is breaking away,'' Simmons said.
</P>
<P>
   Each player has something working against him. Kinchen's chief
role for the Falcons last year was as a punt returner, but Dwight
led the NCAA last year in punt returns, and his quickness has
caught the eye of coaches.
</P>
<P>
   If Dwight wins that job, Kinchen's in trouble unless he proves
good enough to merit a spot as a receiver. He also has been erratic
in camp, though he was very good the last few days.
</P>
<P>
   Crawford, who first played for Falcons coach Dan Reeves in New
York in 1993, caught a career-high 11 passes last year in St.
Louis. He has good speed and is a good special teams player, but a
hamstring injury has kept him out of four straight practices. He's
been working as the third receiver, but he sometimes runs soft
routes.
</P>
<P>
   Hayes, picked up last year at midseason when he was cut by New
Orleans, strained a hamstring Saturday morning. Speed is also his
top asset.
</P>
<P>
   Thornal, who won a spot on the practice squad last year by
catching almost everything in sight as an undrafted rookie out of
SMU, is again catching nearly everything, and is running better
routes. But he's slight of build, and not exceptionally fast.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't know how many we'll keep yet,'' said Simmons, noting
that it depends on the special teams abilities of some players.
``And sometimes it all depends on how things play out with
injuries. Sometimes it plays itself out and it's not a real
complicated thing.''

   USHUAIA, Argentina _ In 1946, someone in Gen. Juan Domingo
Peron's navy came up with the idea of colonizing Tierra del Fuego
with 25 pairs of beavers from Canada to promote the local fur
industry.
</P>
<P>
   Half a century later the Peronist innovation has taken a
Malthusian twist and gone seriously awry. Today this snowy
archipelago on the tip of South America is being overrun by the
beavers.
</P>
<P>
   These beavers are nothing if not eager. They have cut down
hundreds of acres of forests to build dams hundreds of feet long.
Their architectural wonders of branches and mud make fine tourist
attractions, but they are also re-routing streams and rivers,
thereby interrupting trout migrations to traditional spawning
grounds. The beavers have created hundreds of artificial lakes that
are flooding still more forest land and roads, threatening the
livelihoods of island cattlemen and farmers.
</P>
<P>
   But what scientists fear most is the possibility that Tierra del
Fuego's beavers may one day manage to swim _ or be smuggled _
across the Magellan Strait and invade the South American mainland.
</P>
<P>
   ``They could take over the Andean forests,'' warned Alejandro
Gonzalez, a government biologist. ``They must be eliminated.''
</P>
<P>
   Of all the rodents in the world, beavers still have the best
reputation. They are industrious, furry and among a very few
species that are monogamous. Even in Tierra del Fuego, pictures of
beavers appear on postcards. But the beaver's good name has been
tarnished.
</P>
<P>
   ``For us, the beaver isn't just some cute little creature,''
said Juan Manuel Harrington, 51, a strawberry farmer. ``He's a
plague whose dikes flood our forests and erode our land.''
</P>
<P>
   Juan Esteban Rivero, a 52-year-old hunter, said, ``If I don't
hunt down these beavers, the widow who lives next door will lose
all her sheep and cattle from the floods created by these little
animals.''
</P>
<P>
   The Peron government came up with many half-baked ideas that
ruined the Argentine economy for decades. But at the time its
beaver policy seemed perfectly sensible, since fashion-conscious
women around the world draped themselves in pelts without thinking
twice about animal rights.
</P>
<P>
   The unintended consequences of the policy originated from one
simple fact: Tierra del Fuego does not have any of the natural
predators of beavers, like wolves and bears, which flourish in
their original home in the Canadian wilds. Consequently, beavers
have thrived in Tierra del Fuego like nowhere else on earth.
</P>
<P>
   Marta Lizarralde, a researcher at the Austral Center for
Scientific Studies here, estimated that the original population of
50 beavers expanded to 2,500 by 1966, then to 30,000 by 1986,
reaching an estimated 50,000 on the main island of Tierra del Fuego
today. But her figures are for only the Argentine side of the
island. There are tens of thousands more beavers on the Chilean
side.
</P>
<P>
   Having reached saturation point on the main island of the
archipelago, the beavers have swum to several outlying islands and
that makes biologists worry about an eventual continental invasion.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is barely known outside Tierra del Fuego, but
several Argentine government scientists are pressing for a beaver
eradication campaign. Government environmentalists have trained
scores of local hunters in the last year in modern trapping
techniques and they are now distributing 1,100 new beaver traps to
the local population. Meanwhile, the Argentine Foreign Ministry is
pressing the European Community to open its market to Argentine
beavers as a way of raising pelt prices and providing greater
incentives to trappers.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   But the European market for furs has been circumscribed for
years under the pressure of activists pressing for more humane
treatment of animals. European animal lovers have not specifically
attacked Argentine beaver trapping methods _ by global standards,
the trapping of a few thousand beavers a year here is small
potatoes. But their campaign against furs has had an impact here,
according to Argentine government officials.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1991, the United States, Canada, Russia and the European
Community have been trying to negotiate an understanding on the
humane trapping of animals. At the moment, the European Community
has a list of 13 species, including lynx, sable and beaver, that
can be imported into Europe only if caught in traps that
immediately kill their prey.
</P>
<P>
   Until very recently, Argentine hunters used restraining traps
that broke the beavers' legs, a method prohibited by the European
Community. To get around the ban, the Argentine government has
spent more than $50,000 to train and supply trappers so they will
hunt with modern, Canadian-designed traps that reduce animal
suffering by immediately crushing the heads and throats of the
captured beavers.
</P>
<P>
   But late last year, the European Community ruled that it still
could not permit the importation of Argentine beaver pelts because
Argentina's trap-replacement program was confined to Tierra del
Fuego.
</P>
<P>
   Argentina refused to apply a nationwide ban. For now, the
beavers are nowhere in Argentina but Tierra del Fuego. And
officials said they were reluctant to ban restraining traps for
beavers nationwide since those traps are still widely used in other
provinces to hunt fox and coypu, which are not on Europe's
restricted list and together represent up to $80 million in annual
exports.
</P>
<P>
   That animal rights activists in other countries would stand in
the way of Argentina's campaign to halt the beaver scourge ``is
quite a stupid thing,'' said Victoria Lichtschein, director of
forest fauna and flora in Argentina's Natural Resources
Secretariat. ``This is not a species that needs to be protected.''

COMMENTARY: THE ODD FACADE
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By WILLIAM SAFIRE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ A hole the size of a football field was dug just
outside Red Square and a glitzy three-level shopping mall sunk
inside it. A flowering park sits on top, with benches for
sightseers on this summer night, and from it you can contemplate
Kremlin towers and the odd facade of the huge old Hotel Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   The underground mall is the symbol of the new Russia: Its
overpriced foreign shops attract more lookers than buyers and the
only money-makers are the fast-food shops.
</P>
<P>
   The front of the massive 15-story hotel symbolizes the old
Soviet Union. The middle part is square, but its two wings seem
off-center, asymmetrical, as if the architect couldn't decide which
style he liked.
</P>
<P>
   That's because the facade was submitted for Stalin's approval
with alternative designs on the same sheet. The dictator, not
realizing he was supposed to choose only one, wrote his approval
across the center of the drawings. Nobody dared to tell him that _
making Stalin look foolish was an invitation to execution _ so they
built one style on one side, a different style on the other.
Soviet-era Muscovites pretended not to notice.
</P>
<P>
   How do you explain to youthful visitors to this bustling, noisy
and advertising-bedecked Moscow that a climate of fear stultified
city life not so long ago?
</P>
<P>
   ``In communist time,'' as residents say now, a bureaucrat's
scowl would deny access to the countryside or censor your story
beyond recognition. You were followed, your room routinely bugged
and searched, the people you interviewed interrogated by thugs and
sometimes jailed. Oppression was palpable; clothing was drab and
expressions were dull. Everyone was afraid; the outside world was
cut off and no telephone books existed. A Moscow visitor's greatest
pleasure was going home.
</P>
<P>
   Tell that to a visitor now and you get a look that says: Who
needs such creepy recollections? I remember, as a draftee enjoying
my army-of-occupation tour in Germany in the '50s, rolling my young
eyes at the interminable stories of veterans complaining about how
awful Frankfurt was under the Nazis. To a teen-ager, a previous
decade is ancient history.
</P>
<P>
   Journalists are pressed to treat news not as a current of events
but strictly as what is happening today _ ``as we speak,'' so to
speak.
</P>
<P>
   Accordingly, we observe that although Moscow is booming,
one-fourth of the Russian population lives in poverty. We
accurately report that a criminal oligarchy owns major media, molds
opinion and can make or break politicians. We dutifully note how
the unpaid employed are restive, that a hungry Red Army is tempted
to sell its nukes, that the stock market is sinking and capital is
in flight, that everybody smokes and nobody wears seat belts.
</P>
<P>
   But living in the moment does not reflect life in our times.
News, like all reality, has three dimensions _ not just the
happenings of now, but the memory of then and the prospect of soon.
</P>
<P>
   These Russians have climbed a long way in a short time. They
have pulled themselves out of a swamp of phony stability and are
working their way through a painful neo-freedom toward a way of
life that will probably be quite unlike our own.
</P>
<P>
   Should we help? Yes _ when they head toward personal freedom,
open markets and global safety. No _ when they let a mafia
masquerade as enterprise, or supply nuclear know-how to help Iran
threaten Turkey, or support Saddam's Iraq against the United States
and Israel. By conditioning our help on Russian behavior, we
provide strategic structure.
</P>
<P>
   We do not help Russia by submitting to extortionists who warn
that unless we pour in money, economic chaos will bring back
dictatorship. This generation of Americans has learned that welfare
wins no gratitude when given and triggers resentment when ended. As
Russians feel the urgency to discipline their internal predators,
they will.
</P>
<P>
   That's because Russians are escapees from their terrible past.
Outsiders, unscarred by tyranny, cannot feel that past's presence.
A few moments ago, an American teen-ager came up out of the
underground mall cheerfully bearing a T-shirt that features golden
arches over the caption ``McLenin's.'' He cocked his head at the
edifice (that he could not know stands as mocking memorial to a
tyrant's wrath) and said to his girlfriend: ``Funny-lookin' front
on that hotel.''

TO PICK A PRESIDENT, PARTIES MUST PART  
 ACTOR-DAIRY FARMER TRIES HAND AT POLITICS  
 FABLE REVISED: HARE KEEPS EYE ON TORTOISE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By B. DRUMMOND AYRES JR.   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When sponsors of the ballot initiative that resulted in
California's new open-primary law drafted their measure two years
ago, their aim was to loosen up the election process and encourage
participation. But in trying to make things better, they suffered a
memory lapse that may have made things worse.
</P>
<P>
   What they forgot was that the bylaws of both national parties
prohibit the selection of presidential convention delegates in
primaries that are open to all voters. The rationale: Too much
political mischief can occur.
</P>
<P>
   So now California faces the prospect that its delegations to the
next Democratic and Republican national conventions may not be
seated unless the old closed primary system _ under which Democrats
voted for Democrats and Republicans voted for Republicans and never
the twain met _ is reinstated.
</P>
<P>
   Because convention delegations from California are usually the
most important by virtue of the state's having the largest
population, denial of a role in the presidential nominating process
would be a huge and embarrassing political blow. Such rejection
would undoubtedly throw both nominating conventions into turmoil.
</P>
<P>
   What to do?
</P>
<P>
   Come November, Californians will get an opportunity to vote on a
ballot measure that would retain the open-primary law for the
selection of local, state and federal officeholders but would
reinstate the closed, party-by-party voting system for the
selection of convention delegates.
</P>
<P>
   The state Legislature passed a bill calling for the measure,
labeled the Save the Presidential Primary Act, to be put on the
fall ballot. Gov. Pete Wilson readily signed it.
</P>
<P>
   State officials are confident they can persuade voters to
approve the proposition. If it is defeated, however, leaders of
both major parties will be forced to give consideration to choosing
delegates either by holding party caucuses or by calling statewide
conventions, both less politically tidy solutions than primary
voting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever method it would be, it would disenfranchise millions
of Californians who expect that when voting for president, their
vote matters,'' said state Sen. John R. Lewis, R-Orange County, the
chief author of the Save the Presidential Primary Act.
</P>
<P>
   Actor-Dairy Farmer Tries Hand at Politics
</P>
<P>
   Not a lot of people saw it, but a couple of years ago there was
a low-budget movie about a folksy Vermonter who decided to run for
Congress when he couldn't make it any longer as a down-and-out
dairy farmer. His campaign pitch was that he needed the money and,
ahyep, as they say up there in the Green Mountain State, he won,
his opponent being a caricature of an entrenched Washington pol. Of
course.
</P>
<P>
   The movie was called ``Man With a Plan'' and was produced and
directed by a Vermonter, John O'Brien, who hails from Tunbridge,
one of those clapboard farm hamlets on the east-central side of the
state. He persuaded a neighbor, a real Vermont dairy farmer named
Fred Tuttle, to play the lead role.
</P>
<P>
   Now life is imitating art. With O'Brien as his campaign manager,
Fred Tuttle is running for the U.S. Senate, vying with a
millionaire businessman, Jack McMullen, for the Republican
nomination and the right, come the fall, to take on the popular
four-term Democratic incumbent, Patrick Leahy.
</P>
<P>
   If this sounds more like show biz than politics, truth is it's
both.
</P>
<P>
   Tuttle and O'Brien candidly admit that one of their goals is to
stir up some buzz about ``Man With a Plan,'' which is being
considered for a fall showing on national television. But they
insist they also have a serious political goal, which is to keep
the Republican nomination away from McMullen, because he is not a
native Vermonter.
</P>
<P>
   This is no small matter in a state overrun with outsiders in
search of the good life in a beauteous setting. Well before Tuttle
announced his candidacy, McMullen, newly arrived from
Massachusetts, was being hammered by some native-born Vermonters
for being so brassy as to think he was ready to represent their
state in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Tuttle says he does not plan to represent the state in
Washington. He promises that if he bests McMullen in the primary,
the first thing he'll do is endorse Leahy.
</P>
<P>
   Fable Revised: Hare Keeps Eye on Tortoise
</P>
<P>
   The latest polls indicate that in Tuesday's Republican primary
in Kansas, Gov. Bill Graves will breeze to renomination, turning
back the challenge of David Miller, a former state GOP chairman, by
a margin of at least 2-1.
</P>
<P>
   Why, then, has the governor, a moderate, spent close to $1.7
million on the race, a record for a Kansas governor's primary?
</P>
<P>
   The answer lies in voter turnout.
</P>
<P>
   Miller may be trailing badly and scratching around for campaign
money going into the final days of the contest. But as Graves sees
it, there is always the possibility that at the last moment Miller
will energize his base of support _ the Christian hard right, which
he once led in the state _ and the resulting turnout will transform
what had looked like a political blowout into a dead heat.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, a last-minute outpouring of Christian-right
voters has swung several Kansas races. So the governor is running
scared, deliberately, spending big bucks to warn his supporters
that if they do not turn out, he could be in big trouble.
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, the Graves-Miller primary contest is a classic
1990s Republican tiff, a battle not just for control of the party
in one of the most Republican of all states but also a battle for
its ideological soul.
</P>
<P>
   The governor favors abortion rights, has vetoed a bill that
would loosen state gun-control laws and opposes legislation that
would make English the official state language.
</P>
<P>
   Miller, by contrast, opposes abortion, wants fewer gun
restrictions and believes English should be made the state's
official language.
</P>
<P>
   As for the Democratic primary on Tuesday, polls indicate that
Tom Sawyer, the minority leader of the Kansas House of
Representatives, will be a runaway winner. But the polls also
indicate that if he goes head-to-head with the governor in the
fall, the governor will be a runaway winner.
</P>
<P>
   Political Calendar
</P>
<P>
   Michigan and Missouri, as well as Kansas, have primaries
Tuesday.

Olajuwon says he still can provide what Rockets need
<TEXT>
<P>
   By Fran Blinebury &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Houston Chronicle
</P>
<P>
   ATHENS, Greece _ In a back hallway at the Olympic Stadium, he
sneaks up behind former teammate David Wood and gives him a gentle
elbow in the back that interrupts a television interview and then
dances away giggling.
</P>
<P>
   He wraps up Rockets trainer Keith Jones in a happy bearhug, then
looks across the retaining wall that holds back the media horde and
spots a couple of familiar faces from home.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, man,'' says Hakeem Olajuwon, as a grin begins to spread.
``This is just like being in Houston. What are you all doing
here?''
</P>
<P>
   Half a world away and the faces, the jokes and the questions
remain the same. He has spent his summer in his usual style, that
of the international traveler, businessman and ambassador for the
NBA, though the latter role is unofficial this year because of the
labor strife and lockout.
</P>
<P>
   Olajuwon has made his annual pilgrimage to Mecca, and his
previous stop was in Jordan before arriving to spend a day at the
World Championship of Basketball. His mood is as light as an Athens
breeze. Yet he knows back in Houston there is concern about his
health, about the bad wheels that were responsible for the worst
season of his NBA career, about advancing age that might be eroding
some of his skills.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess,'' he says, ``it is not permissible to look at what
happened and acknowledge that I had knee surgery and accept that
anyone is going to suffer in performance because of that. There is
always a need to try to find another reason. Maybe the search can
be more interesting, but it does not necessarily reveal the
truth.''
</P>
<P>
   Standing in the shadow of the Acropolis, he seems a perfect fit
here, having always philosophized like Socrates and Plato while
performing the labors of Hercules on the court.
</P>
<P>
   He knows the end is coming. He has seen his good friend Clyde
Drexler head off into cozy retirement, if that's what you can call
the heady task of trying to revive the glory at the University of
Houston.
</P>
<P>
   But at 35, he says there is no reason to put his career behind
the glass display case of a museum, like it was an ancient Greek
artifact.
</P>
<P>
   ``The left knee, which had the surgery, is feeling fine,'' he
says. ``The right knee was bothering me at the end of the season,
and I thought then that I might need surgery on that one. But I had
an MRI and I spoke to (Rockets team physician) Dr. (Walter) Lowe
and he said we should not operate now. He said there were things he
did not want to touch in my right knee and what I needed to do this
summer was to strengthen both of my quadriceps so that there would
not be as much strain on the knees.
</P>
<P>
   ``The right knee began to bother me after the surgery. It's
natural to compensate. I never got my rhythm back. I was never able
to play with the ease and the flow that makes my game what it is.
If I'm thinking about playing, then I'm not just playing.
</P>
<P>
   ``While I've been traveling, I've been doing exercises to
strengthen both legs. I've walked up mountains. I want to be ready
whenever the season starts.''
</P>
<P>
   But with nothing to prove after one subpar season in a 14-year
career of setting standards for centers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never play to prove anything,'' he says. ``To play to prove
something is to be small-minded. I have a bigger picture. I play to
do all that I can. I play to have fun. I play to win, whether it's
a pickup game at Fonde or in the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people look at age and say it is a negative. I think of
it as experience. The game is actually easier for me now. I know so
many things.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hear people say, `Does he still have the drive after two
championships?' That is a low mentality. It assumes I played harder
in those two years. This is ignorance. They say we won because I
learned to trust my teammates and don't ask if it was a different
system that allowed me and my teammates to thrive.''
</P>
<P>
   And he believes they can thrive again.
</P>
<P>
   ``We already have three or four new, young players. There is
money to spend under the salary cap. We should be thinking about
getting young talent. Not Scottie Pippen. Too old. Someone like
(Antonio) McDyess. Young legs and young talent.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Olajuwon knows all championship hopes begin and end with
him, and he can't understand the sudden panic, even trade rumors.
</P>
<P>
   ``To think I can't play, that is ignorance,'' he says. ``I want
to be healthy. I want to play. I will. Doubt me, go ahead. People
have been wrong about me before.''
</P>
<P>
   From ancient Mount Olympus to modern-day Houston, it's a lesson
the Greeks learned a long time ago: don't make the gods angry.

 &HT;    150-year-old church founded by slaves holds final service
 &HT;    By Jingle Davis
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUGUSTA, Ga. _ Members of the Trinity Christian Methodist
Episcopal Church hugged, held hands, wept and remembered as they
bid an emotional farewell Sunday night to ``Mother Trinity,'' the
church that has served their congregation for more than 150 years.
</P>
<P>
   Founded in 1843 by slaves who bought the freedom of their first
pastor, the church is relocating because of toxic pollution in its
downtown neighborhood from a defunct gas manufacturing plant. Many
members brought cameras and video cameras to document the final
gathering, which closed with the hymn ``Til We Meet Again.''
</P>
<P>
   During the final service in the historic red brick structure,
Maxine Wilson Thurmond, a lifelong member, celebrated the
christening of her 2-week-old grandson, Da'Henri Ramsey Thurmond
Jr. Last month, she mourned at her mother's funeral.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mother was a part of the past and my grandson is a part of
the future,'' Thurmond said. ``He will be worshiping in the new
church.''
</P>
<P>
   But there is no new church. The congregation will meet at nearby
Paine College until land is purchased and a sanctuary built,
according to the Rev. Ronzell Maness.
</P>
<P>
   For about a century, Atlanta Gas Light Co. made gas from coal at
a plant just across the narrow neighborhood street from the church.
The process of ``cooking'' the coal at high temperatures left
behind coal tar, a byproduct now known to contain substances
suspected of causing cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Before the plant closed in 1955, employees disposed of tons of
coal tar at the site. The sticky, black material eventually seeped
into soil and ground water, contaminating the church yard and other
parts of the blue-collar neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the plant site is surrounded by barbed wire fences posted
with ``Danger: No Trespassing'' signs. Gas company officials,
chastised by environmental agencies for foot-dragging on cleanup
efforts, have said they expect to make ``significant progress''
this year toward sanitizing the site.
</P>
<P>
   Coal tar also contaminated parts of the nearby Augusta Canal,
which flows into the Savannah River.
</P>
<P>
   The company did not appeal a court judgment this spring that
ruled Atlanta Gas Light should pay $3 million to the church, plus
$1 million more in attorneys' fees and interest. The church was a
plaintiff in a class-action lawsuit brought against the gas
company.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the settlement, church members voted to sell the
historic building to the company and relocate.
</P>
<P>
   Louvenia Pearson, 81, said it will be hard for her to move to a
new location.
</P>
<P>
   ``But they said this place is contaminated, so I'm willing to
go,'' she said.

DIGITAL COMMERCE: INTERNET IS SNAGGING ON FREE-MARKET APPETITES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)  (lb) 
 By DENISE CARUSO   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When does the term ``commercial Internet'' become an oxymoron?
Perhaps when powerful corporations use their market strength to
impose technical standards _ intended to further their own
interests and improve their bottom lines _ at the expense of
universal access to online goods and services.
</P>
<P>
   The browser war between Microsoft and Netscape Communications
already threatens a truly global marketplace that is fully
accessible with any browser on any computer platform. And this
threat is growing with the continuing push toward unilateral
standards that will dictate how consumers will one day interact,
for example, with online video programming or World Wide Web pages.
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, this trend merely reflects companies' attempts to
differentiate their products _ an axiom of capitalism _ in the
chaotic Internet market. But in other cases, it stems from an
unrestrained appetite to control the flow of electronic commerce.
</P>
<P>
   Such appetites ignore the fact that the reason the Internet
exists at all is that its technical protocols are open standards,
freely available for use by everyone. Standards were the reason for
its rapid adoption by the commercial world: The network itself
became exponentially more valuable as its popularity avalanched and
more companies and users tumbled to the benefits of being online.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet's ultimate seduction was that no matter what kind
of computer one used, its standardized protocols would smooth out
the rough spots and give the user as uniform and predictable an
online experience as possible.
</P>
<P>
   But the World Wide Web browser war that erupted in 1996, when
Microsoft launched the market equivalent of a thermonuclear attack
on Netscape's Navigator, brought that fairy tale to an abrupt end.
</P>
<P>
   Almost overnight, notices started appearing on various Web
sites, declaring that the sites had been ``optimized'' for one
browser or the other: ``Best viewed with Internet Explorer'' or
``Navigator required to display this page.''
</P>
<P>
   Such practices annoyed users, who until then could view
virtually everything that was on the Web no matter what computer or
browser they were using, and infuriated Web pioneers. They saw
browser battles as turf wars, the first step toward Balkanization
of the Internet _ a step that, if you believed the power of the
network to be collective by nature, would ultimately defeat the
purpose.
</P>
<P>
   More recently came the so-called portal, a thinly veiled
advertising strategy that purports to draw Web users into the
wonderful world of Disney, say, or Netscape or Yahoo, and keep them
there.
</P>
<P>
   But of course the trend for companies to establish their
proprietary identities atop the open Internet protocols did not
stop with software.
</P>
<P>
   Take, for example, the ``optimized content'' initiative
sponsored by Intel. So blatant that it is almost endearing, the
initiative encourages Web developers to ``optimize'' Web sites so
they look noticeably better running on a Pentium II-based computer.
This means, conversely, that they look noticeably worse if you
happen not to own a Pentium II _ which is the precise situation
that Intel hopes to remedy.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, none of these companies can really be expected to do
anything but mess around with the open standards of the Internet.
They are just following the laws of the free-market jungle.
</P>
<P>
   But an industry analyst notes that standards are also used as a
club by market leaders, thus stifling innovation.
</P>
<P>
   William Gurley, an analyst and venture capitalist with Hummer
Winblad Venture Partners in San Francisco, took on the issue of
standards in a recent article, saying that they actually run
counter to the interests of small, innovative companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Open is a euphemism for commodity,'' Gurley wrote. ``In
commodity markets, people differentiate with production or
distribution prowess and not with innovation.'' And the companies
with production and distribution prowess are generally the market
leaders.
</P>
<P>
   So, he says, although everyone believes that ``open'' is really
good for innovation _ especially in the Internet economy _ actually
``open'' is the most reliable way to preserve the status quo.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet is today's hottest commodity, and an industry
announcement last week serves as a model for Gurley's point.
</P>
<P>
   The new Advanced Television Enhancement Forum, a coalition of
media and technology giants spearheaded by Intel, said it had
defined a modification to the standard Internet language, HTML,
that will govern the digital distribution, via the Internet, of
television programming with data added.
</P>
<P>
   And of course the specification also includes new computerized
products for consumers to buy, devices that are designed to display
the hybrid data.
</P>
<P>
   The group _ whose members include CNN, Disney, Microsoft, NBC,
Sony and Warner Bros. _ said that it intended to submit its new
rules to a variety of standards bodies, including W3C, the World
Wide Web Consortium, but that it would not await the group's
approval before promoting the standard to the industry.
</P>
<P>
   Gurley says it will be impossible for any start-up not to
support a standard from such a powerful series of market leaders.
If he is right, the Advanced TV Forum has, then, already trumped
any competing technical innovations that might be in the pipeline.
However, it also sloughs off vast numbers of existing Internet
users who may never have the proper equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Why would these entertainment and media companies make such a
huge investment in a tiny fraction of the Internet market _ which
is already a fraction of their existing markets for movies and
music _ in a genre where there continue to be no compelling
interactive applications or income?
</P>
<P>
   If differentiation is indeed the only way to succeed in
business, then it is clear that the Internet as it was designed _
global, two-way and largely accessible by anyone _ is going the way
of all flesh.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the question remains: Is there some point at which
differentiation kills the goose that laid the golden egg?

RUSSIA STARTS TO FEEL PAIN AS MINERS BLOCK RAILS 
</HEADLINE>
  (jw) 
 By MICHAEL WINES   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ No other group embodies the frustration with Russia's
hobbling economic system as much as its coal miners, who have held
sit-ins, marched and blocked rail lines for months over their
inability to get paid _ and all to a collective national yawn.
</P>
<P>
   Now it appears that their protests are beginning to bite.
</P>
<P>
   During the weekend, officials on the island of Sakhalin in
Russia's Far East announced that as a result of a protest by
miners, the officials might have to cut off electricity for 24
hours sometime in the next several days to all but essential users
like water-pumping stations and hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   Already, many of the island's 720,000 residents are without
power for as much as 14 hours a day.
</P>
<P>
   The power shutdowns are rooted in a protest by coal miners, who
have prevented trains from carrying fuel to the island's main
electrical generating station for two weeks. The chief of the
island's main utility, Sakhalinenergo, said Sunday that the company
had only a four-day reserve of coal for the generators.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is that the only miners' protest. Near Vladivostok, 61
miners are on a hunger strike to protest a six-month backup of
unpaid wages and are threatening to block the Trans-Siberian
Railroad line to the port of Nakhodka on the Sea of Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Much farther west, in the Ural Mountains, more than 300 miners
in the city of Chelyabinsk have shut off a Trans-Siberian rail line
for almost a week, raising fears of environmental problems if power
to the Mayak nuclear-waste reprocessing plant there is cut off for
lack of fuel.
</P>
<P>
   And in Moscow itself, about 200 miners have long been encamped
in front of the main office complex of the Russian Federation,
banging their hard hats on the marble steps in a drumbeat of
complaint about the lack of pay and work.
</P>
<P>
   The miners complain that the government, once the sole owner of
the industry and now a shareholder in many mines, has reneged on
back wages. The Sakhalin protesters, for example, say they are owed
arrears totaling more than $16 million. Miners outside Vladivostok,
in the city of Partizansk, say they are owed wages dating back to
November; nearly the entire adult population of the city turned out
at a rally in their support.
</P>
<P>
   But how much of this is the fault of the cash-strapped
government of President Boris Yeltsin is another matter. Many of
the mines have been privatized since the fall of communism. Others
have been closed because they are simply too inefficient to compete
with lower-cost coal shipped in from Central Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Boris Nemtsov, deputy prime minister in charge of energy
programs, says the miners have in general been paid whatever wages
the government owes them. Their complaints, Nemtsov contends, lie
with the owners of the mines _ in some cases workers' cooperatives
_ and with the miners' unions.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, though, Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko adopted a
harder line, warning that ``the government will restore order''
before the strikes cause a social breakdown.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   That prompted the national miners union, Rosugleprofsoyuz, to
warn that it will ask its 600,000 members to engage in civil
disobedience, including blocking entrances to foreign embassies, if
force is used against them.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, government leaders seemed to back away from the
threat of force, but it remained unclear what they could do should
the strikes and protests begin to exact a greater nationwide toll.
</P>
<P>
   On Sakhalin, about 70 rail cars carrying more than 4,000 tons of
coal sit idle, just yards outside the entrance to the main power
generating station. Miners have promised to keep blocking the cars
for another week if their demands are not met.
</P>
<P>
   That would be troublesome, but not nearly as disastrous as
another threat: If their back wages are not paid by this autumn,
spokesmen for the miners say, they will block all rail traffic in
and out of Moscow itself.

<P>
   Imagine that Albert Einstein were alive today and that he were
just now formulating his theory of relativity. Could he get a
patent on E(EQUALS)mc2?
</P>
<P>
   Some patent experts contend that Einstein might be able to,
thanks to a recent ruling by the federal U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The case in question _ State Street Bank and Trust Co. vs.
Signature Financial Group _ had nothing to do with physics. Rather,
at issue was a patent for a data-processing system for a so-called
hub-and-spoke mutual fund partnership in which mutual funds pool
their assets in an investment portfolio.
</P>
<P>
   The appeals court's ruling has been long awaited by financial
services companies, which have resisted the idea that innovative
approaches in their industry should be patented. Visa and
Mastercard filed an amicus brief in the case saying they were doing
just fine without patents, thank you.
</P>
<P>
   But to no avail. The appeals court ruled on July 23 in favor of
Signature Financial, upholding its patent.
</P>
<P>
   In its ruling, the court said, ``We hold the transformation of
data, representing discrete dollar amounts, by a machine through a
series of mathematical calculations into a final share price,
constitutes a practical application of a mathematical algorithm,
formula, or calculation, because it produces `a useful, concrete,
and tangible result.'''
</P>
<P>
   Translation: If your mathematical formula has a practical end,
you can probably patent it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe this is going to cause a surge in patents relating
to financial instruments,'' said Peter Roberts, chief executive of
College Savings Bank of Princeton, N.J., who in 1988 received a
pioneering patent for a computerized prepaid tuition program.
</P>
<P>
   Some patent experts suggested that such an interpretation might
have allowed Michael Milken, for example, to have patented the idea
of junk bonds in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   But the ruling may have even wider implications.
</P>
<P>
   E. Robert Yoches, a partner with the law firm of Finnegan,
Henderson, Farabow, Garrett &AMP; Dunner in Washington, said he thought
the appeals court had made the right decision in the case. But he
said the court had gone further than expected in its ruling.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is very broad, very sweeping,'' Yoches said. ``You can
probably get a patent on anything as long as it's not purely
mathematical _ as long as it produces a concrete, tangible
result.''
</P>
<P>
   The ruling seems to bolster software patenting guidelines issued
three years ago by the Patent and Trademark Office, which expanded
the definition of what kinds of software are patentable.
</P>
<P>
   The last time the Supreme Court ruled in this area was in 1981,
in the case of Diamond vs. Diehr. Then the court held that three
categories of matter are unpatentable: laws of nature, natural
phenomena and abstract ideas.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the appeals court, which is the highest patent court
in the land short of the Supreme Court, has deviated from this
interpretation in a series of rulings.
</P>
<P>
   ``The direction the federal circuit has been moving is to say
you can patent anything as long as it's economically valuable,''
said Richard Stern, who teaches computer patent law at George
Washington University.
</P>
<P>
   Stanley Amberg, a patent attorney in New York, said the appeals
court had gone too far with the State Street ruling. ``The federal
circuit has crossed over a critical line, and now holds eligible
for patent protection any computer-implemented math equation in
which the input are numbers and the output are numbers,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thus, if Einstein were alive and now uncovered the
E(EQUALS)mc2 law of nature, he could effectively monopolize its use
in the design of atomic reactors, bombs, et cetera,'' Amberg said.
``Because, for all practical purposes, a computer must be used to
perform the calculation of the amount of energy released.''
</P>
<P>
   Cutting Paper Use on the Exchange Floor
</P>
<P>
   Despite the advent of cell phones and headsets and special
electronic orders, most large buy and sell orders on the New York
Stock Exchange still involve paper transactions.
</P>
<P>
   Papyrus Technology Corp. in New York has patented a system using
hand-held devices that allow floor brokers to receive and execute
orders electronically.
</P>
<P>
   ``The floor broker enters information into the device as the
order is being filled,'' said L. Thomas Patterson Jr., one of the
inventors. ``This takes the paper out of the whole process.''
</P>
<P>
   The exchange has developed its own hand-held electronic device,
which it recently introduced and which is being used by a small
number of brokers. Patterson declined to comment on whether he
thought the exchange's devices infringed his patent.
</P>
<P>
   Patterson, Desmond Sean O'Neill and Stephen Tyler Carroll
received patent 5,774,877, which is assigned to Papyrus Technology.
</P>
<P>
   Patents are available by number for $3 from the Patent and
Trademark Office, Washington, D.C. 20231.

   NEW YORK _ Someone probably had to take the fall. Conde Nast
Publications, a unit of Advance Publications, is still licking its
wounds over an article in Fortune magazine last month that said
that the company was ``a woeful underperformer'' and that ``truth
is a fungible commodity'' in the hands of its chief executive,
Steven Florio.
</P>
<P>
   A flurry of spinning came from the Florio camp, with supporters
of Florio calling the article ``a hatchet job.'' But no heads
rolled _ until now.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Andrea Kaplan, the head of corporate communications
at Conde Nast, who also handled publicity for six magazines,
resigned after reading in The New York Observer that Maurie Perl,
the head of publicity at The New Yorker, would take over Conde
Nast's corporate public relations operation.
</P>
<P>
   No one at Conde Nast would comment on whether Ms. Kaplan's
implicit demotion was linked to the Fortune profile. But it was
widely known that after granting an initial interview to the
authors, Joseph Nocera and Peter Elkind, Florio had declined to
cooperate further and was dissatisfied with Ms. Kaplan's handling
of the article.
</P>
<P>
   It was then left to Ms. Kaplan to stammer defenses of Florio's
statements that he had played minor-league baseball and college
football and had been a premed major.
</P>
<P>
   But as angry as Florio is known to be about the article, he has
yet to ask for a correction or retraction, said John Huey,
Fortune's managing editor.
</P>
<P>
   Conde Nast executives say that Ms. Kaplan was asked to stay on
as a publicist for several magazines but that she declined and
decided to leave. Ms. Kaplan and Ms. Perl declined to comment, and
Florio was unavailable for comment on Friday. But when asked a few
weeks ago about the possibility of his replacing Ms. Kaplan with
Ms. Perl, he said, ``I plead the Fifth.''

   WNET Seeks Way to Keep a Favorite on Air
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Dhaliwal and Woolsey? It doesn't quite roll off the
tongue like Huntley and Brinkley, or, perhaps more to the point,
like MacNeil-Lehrer.
</P>
<P>
   But William Baker, the president of WNET/Channel 13 in New York,
has an oddball idea, a way to capture some of the following
attracted by Daljit Dhaliwal. Ms. Dhaliwal is the British news
reader whose weeknight international reports for Britain's ITN News
have been carried on 19 public television stations in the United
States for the last few years but are being dropped.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Dhaliwal, a 35-year-old Londoner, is popular among
Anglophiles and PBS news addicts in those 19 cities. Fans have put
up a Web site devoted to her, and this month's Rolling Stone
featured her on its ``Hot List'' as ``Hot News Reader.''
</P>
<P>
   In New York, Ms. Dahliwal's followers have found her at 11:30
p.m. during the week on WLIW/Channel 21, the Long Island station
that carried ITN's International News for six years. But WLIW plans
to replace it, starting on Nov. 1, with three daily programs from
ITN's better-known rival, the BBC World television news service.
</P>
<P>
   ``Daljit is a talent,'' Baker said on Friday. ``But we have a
very tight schedule carrying all the PBS lineup.''
</P>
<P>
   So he is toying with the idea of combining one-minute
international reports read by Ms. Dhaliwal with one-minute local
news reports by WNET's Midge Woolsey and showing them as ``news
breaks'' in prime time.
</P>
<P>
   ``And maybe at the end of the day, after `Charlie Rose,' we
could throw on a longer show with Daljit and promote it in prime
time,'' Baker said.
</P>
<P>
   Garron Baines, an ITN managing director, confirmed by telephone
that he had been talking to Baker about creating a news program for
WNET.
</P>
<P>
   ``Midge Woolsey in New York and Daljit in England,'' Baker said.
``That wouldn't be your usual local-station news break, with a
bunch of car crashes and a quick weather forecast.''
</P>

<P>
   Scholar Puts Opinion of Clinton Aide on Record
</P>
<P>
   In Washington's interlocking circles of the press, politics and
research groups, people generally have a good idea about who
dislikes whom. But a conservative scholar, questioned last week in
the civil lawsuit accusing Internet gossip columnist Matt Drudge of
defamation, has left absolutely no room for doubt.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Ledeen, a resident scholar at the American Enterprise
Institute, testified under oath that he ``hates'' Sidney
Blumenthal, the White House aide and former journalist, but that he
never suggested to Drudge or anyone else that Blumenthal had abused
his wife.
</P>
<P>
   In his deposition and in a later interview, Ledeen said that the
day after Drudge reported accusations that Blumenthal ``has a
spousal abuse past that has been effectively covered up,'' the
gossip columnist called him asking how to check out such an
allegation. Ledeen suggested examining police records and, if the
accusations proved false, to, in Ledeen's words, ``apologize and
retract immediately.''
</P>
<P>
   Soon thereafter, Drudge apologized and retracted the report.
Soon after that, Blumenthal sued Drudge.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the subpoenas of Ledeen and his wife, policy
analyst Barbara Ledeen, Blumenthal's lawyers have also subpoenaed
John Fund, an editorial writer for The Wall Street Journal, seeking
documents and testimony. This subpoena was deferred Friday after
Journal lawyers said they would move to quash it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The attempt to drag John Fund into this case,'' said Richard
Tofel, a spokesman for the newspaper, ``is an attempt by a senior
White House staffer, who says he brought the lawsuit with the
approval of the president and vice president, to intimidate
editorialists whose views they don't like.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, horse manure,'' William McDaniel, Blumenthal's lawyer,
responded in an interview. ``John Fund has been named in
publications from Vanity Fair to The New York Observer saying he's
deeply involved in this.'' Drudge, however, denied in an interview
that he had ever spoken with Fund.

`PRIVATE RYAN' DEFENDS POSITION AT TOP OF BOX OFFICE PILE
</HEADLINE>
 BOX-OFFICE-LADN (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DAVE MCNARY  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Steven Spielberg's ``Saving Private Ryan'' easily
won a second box office victory with an estimated $23.3 million at
2,540 theaters nationwide during the Friday-Sunday period, studio
sources said.
</P>
<P>
   The much-praised D-Day epic has taken in an impressive $73.1
million in its first 10 days for DreamWorks SKG. Its Friday-Sunday
take fell only 24 percent from its opening weekend, indicating that
``Saving Private Ryan'' will continue to post solid numbers after
the summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``The 24 percent decline is very low for a second weekend,''
said DreamWorks distribution chief James Tharp. ``We think it will
play very well into the fall.''
</P>
<P>
   Industry tracker Robert Bucksbaum of Reel Source projected final
domestic box office for ``Saving Private Ryan'' of more than $150
million. ``It could get close to $200 million if it gets brought
back following Academy Award nominations next year,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Analyst Arthur Rockwell of Drake Capital Securities said he
expects ``Saving Private Ryan'' to receive strong support overseas,
where co-financer Paramount in handling the release.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ryan'' took in more than double its nearest rival, Disney's
update of ``The Parent Trap'' with $11.5 million at 2,247 sites.
The remake of the 1961 comedy also grossed $5.1 million during its
first two days -- Wednesday and Thursday -- and will generate solid
profits since it was a relatively inexpensive project, Rockwell
said.
</P>
<P>
   Bucksbaum noted that ``The Parent Trap'' drew particularly well
among adults in addition to its target audience of pre-teen girls.
</P>
<P>
   Also performing impressively was 20th Century Fox's third
weekend of the hit comedy ``There's Something About Mary'' with
$11.2 million at 2,145 screens as it moved up a notch to third
place _ an unusual feat during the hyper-competitive summer season
as it lost a mere 10 percent from the prior weekend.
</P>
<P>
   `` `Mary' should play very well for the rest of the summer,''
Rockwell said. ``It's holding up weekend to weekend almost as well
as `Titanic' did.'' ``Mary'' has topped $60 million in 19 days.
</P>
<P>
   Warner Bros.' opening of ``The Negotiator,'' with Kevin Spacey
and Samuel L. Jackson, followed in fourth with a respectable $9.7
million at 2,436 theaters, beating Fox's debut of ``Ever After,''
starring Drew Barrymore as a 16th Century Cinderella, which took in
$9 million at 1,967 screens.
</P>
<P>
   The weekend's other major opening, Universal's low-brow sports
comedy ``BASEketball,'' was a major disappointment as it finished
11th with a tepid $3 million at 1,907 theaters. Its R rating may
have forced many younger customers to buy tickets for PG-13, PG and
G movies at the box office and then sneak into the auditorium
showing ``BASEketball,'' Bucksbaum said.
</P>
<P>
   Sony's third weekend of ``The Mask of Zorro'' came in sixth,
with $8.4 million at 2,515 sites, followed by Warner's fourth
weekend of ``Lethal Weapon 4,'' with $7.9 million at 2,602
locations, and Disney's fifth weekend of ``Armageddon,'' with $7.5
million at 2,602 theaters. The asteroid-vs.-Earth spectacular has
topped $163 million in 33 days and ranks 46th on the all-time
domestic list behind ``The Exorcist.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox's sixth weekend of ``Dr. Dolittle'' finished ninth with $4.3
million at 2,180 theaters to top $125 million overall, followed by
Disney's second weekend of ``Mafia!'' with $3.6 million at 1,944
locations.
</P>
<P>
   Following ``BASEkebtall'' were MGM's second weekend of
``Disturbing Behavior,'' with $2.9 million at 1,842 locations,
DreamWorks' fourth weekend of ``Small Soldiers,'' with $2.7 million
at 1,701 sites, and Disney's seventh weekend of ``Mulan,'' with
$1.6 million at 1,175 screens.
</P>
<P>
   Overall box office was 2.6 percent ahead of the same weekend
last year. ``This is a strong weekend with a good range of
product,'' Rockwell said.
</P>
<P>
   Year-to-date business has topped $3.8 billion and is about 7
percent ahead of the same period last year, with much of the gain
from Paramount's ``Titanic.'' It posted a still-impressive $1.15
million at 769 theaters in its 33rd weekend to push its overall
domestic total to $595.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   Miramax's opening of ``Full Tilt Boogie,'' a documentary on the
making of ``From Dusk 'Til Dawn,'' failed to draw well, taking in
$10,000 at six theaters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Saving Private Ryan'' will face competition next weekend from
two new entries _ Paramount's action-drama ``Snake Eyes,'' starring
Nicolas Cage, and Miramax's ``Halloween: H2O,'' with Jamie Lee
Curtis reprising her role as scream queen Laurie Strode.

TOUR ENDS FOR RIDERS ON THE STORM
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By CRAIG R. WHITNEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ The Tour de France is dead. Vive le Tour de France.
</P>
<P>
   When the most famous race in cycling ended Sunday, the consensus
in the French sports world was that the Tour would have to be
reborn to survive.
</P>
<P>
   The myth of almost superhuman endurance and physical stamina
that made the Tour into one of the great French legends since its
beginning in 1903 died this summer as investigating magistrates and
the police piled up evidence that it was pervasive use of illegal
drugs that made many of those fantastic performances possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're all on drugs,'' said Leah Perrissoud, a retired nurse
who comes every year to cheer the racers, as tens of thousands of
people did Sunday, as they race up and down the Champs-Elysees at
the end of the grueling race. ``All sports seem to be riddled with
drugs.''
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the Tour competitors and other athletes would take
issue with that, but by next year, the government's minister of
youth and sports, Marie-George Buffet, expects to have a new law in
place that would take drug controls out of the hands of all sports
federations and put them under the authority of a new nine-member
state council with the power to test athletes, bar offenders from
competitions, and punish teams and doctors who violate the
prohibitions with up to seven years in jail.
</P>
<P>
   ``Doping and medically assisted doping is unacceptable,'' said
Buffet, who has made the fight against illegal drug use in sports a
priority since taking office more than a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   That this doping scandal is being openly discussed is in itself
a shock in a country that until recently was almost proud of its
worldly cynicism, the kind that shrugged at crimes everybody knew
were taking place because everybody was committing them.
</P>
<P>
   Since the beginning of the 1990s, many practices that used to be
taken for granted _ shaking down public contractors to finance
French political parties, bribing Third World officials to win
lucrative defense contracts for the French arms trade, using money
to fix French soccer games _ have all been zealously prosecuted by
fiercely independent investigating magistrates like the ones who
hounded the Tour de France around the country these past three
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   French investigating magistrates, a species somewhere between
prosecutors and judges in American law, have enormous discretion to
probe, detain, question and imprison people they suspect of
committing crimes. Napoleon, who decreed the legal code that
created the system, said that only the emperor himself had more
power.
</P>
<P>
   Crusading magistrates have indicted so many politicians and
business leaders in recent years that the French people became fed
up _ not with the prosecutors, but with the politicians and others
who took them for suckers for so long.
</P>
<P>
   A few people in some of the small French towns the Tour passed
through whistled in derision or turned their backs on the cyclists
who struggled to keep the race going amid the scandal, an
expression of letdown after the national mood of jubilation after
France's World Cup championship in soccer last month.
</P>
<P>
   President Jacques Chirac and Prime Minister Lionel Jospin, who
feted the soccer champions at the Elysee Palace on the July 14
national holiday, went on vacations thousands of miles away and
were not here for the Tour de France finish, leaving it to Paris
Mayor Jean Tiberi to do the honors.
</P>
<P>
   There was some public sympathy, to be sure, for the champion
athletes like Laurent Jalabert, who quit the race after complaining
that they were being treated like animals and asked why the police
could not wait until after the race was over to question suspect
athletes.
</P>
<P>
   That was before the Italian racer Rodolfo Massi was placed under
judiciary examination, one formal step short of indictment, on
Friday on suspicion of having used doping substances himself and
inciting other racers to use them.
</P>
<P>
   Now the scandal has taken on diplomatic ramifications. The Dutch
sports minister said the Netherlands would launch a probe of its
own into the conduct of the French investigators, and there was
talk of a boycott of the Tour de France by foreign teams next year.
</P>
<P>
   But on the whole, the French actions have stimulated a new look
at the wider problem of doping in all sports.
</P>
<P>
   International Olympic Committee President Juan Antonio Samaranch
has called a board meeting in Lausanne, Switzerland, on Aug. 20 to
prepare for a doping summit in January, though he created
controversy by saying that in his opinion, performance-enhancing
drugs should be permitted unless they pose a threat to the health
of the athletes who use them.
</P>
<P>
   Buffet, who increased her French sports ministry's budget for
antidoping action from $1.43 million in 1997 to more than $4
million in the coming year, sharply disagreed, denouncing what she
called ``a vast trafficking in doping products that endangers human
lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Tour de France director Jean-Marie Leblanc said: ``Sports and
cycling can't find solutions to this problem all by themselves.
There has to be constructive help from the scientists, from the
doctors.
</P>
<P>
   ``There should also be a regular health-monitoring system, so
that the athlete isn't tempted to cross the yellow line under the
influence of shady doctors, trainers and drug traffickers.''

   After more than a century apart, two paintings by Claude
Monet &UR;  &LR; are to be reunited, Monday through Oct. 4, at New York's
Frick Collection. The paintings _ ``Vetheuil in Summer,'' from the
Art Gallery of Ontario in Toronto, and ``Vetheuil in Winter,'' from
the Frick _ depict the village of Vetheuil, some 40 miles west of
Paris, from the same perspective across the Seine.
</P>
<P>
   The winter scene was bought by Monet's friend Dr. Georges de
Bellio, a Romanian physician and avid Monet collector, in December
1879, and the summer scene in 1879 or 1880. Eventually, both Monets
came to Wildenstein &AMP; Co. in New York, which sold the summer scene
to the Ontario museum in 1929 and the winter scene to the Frick
Collection in 1942. Information: (212) 288-0700.

A RECORD IN DUMAURIER SOUNDS JUST FINE TO BURTON 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By CLIFTON BROWN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WINDSOR, Ontario _ Brandie Burton had waited five years for this
moment, and the pressure was almost too much to bear.
</P>
<P>
   After 71 holes and four days of superb play, Burton reached the
final hole of the du Maurier Classic still needing an 8-foot putt
to win. If she made the putt, Burton would win an LPGA tournament
for the first time since 1993. But if Burton missed, she would face
a sudden-death playoff against Annika Sorenstam, the tour's most
consistent player, who had been chasing Burton all day.
</P>
<P>
   As Burton lined up the putt, it was a chore to keep her emotions
in check.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can honestly say I don't remember seeing the ball when I was
addressing it,'' Burton said.
</P>
<P>
   Sorenstam, kneeling on the 18th green, covered her eyes as
Burton prepared to putt. ``I was nervous, and I didn't want to
watch,'' Sorenstam said. ``You can always tell by the crowd.''
</P>
<P>
   The roar said it all. Finishing at 18-under-par 270 for the
tournament _ a record for an LPGA major _ Burton defeated Sorenstam
by one stroke. Betsy King finished in third place, a distant five
strokes off the pace.
</P>
<P>
   Burton's rounds of 68-64-66-72 at Essex Golf and Country Club
broke the previous record of 16 under par for an LPGA major, set by
Jody Rosenthal at the 1987 du Maurier and equaled by Cathy Johnson
at the 1990 du Maurier. While Sunday's 72 was Burton's worst round
of the tournament, she held the lead all day and displayed a superb
short game under pressure that consistently allowed her to escape
trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Burton started the final round with a three-stroke lead over
Sorenstam and Meg Mallon. Mallon shot a 75 and faded on the back
nine, falling into a five-way tie for fourth place (276) with Gail
Graham, Dawn Coe-Jones, Deb Richard and Michelle Estill. But
Sorenstam, who shot a 70 despite not playing her best, pushed
Burton to the final shot.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was shaky all day, but I gave it all I had,'' said
Sorenstam, whose second-place share of $111,711 moved her to No. 1
on this year's LPGA money list with $790,495, just ahead of Se Ri
Pak ($773,645). ``I was beaten by someone who played really well.
Brandie's short game was incredible. She got up and down from
everywhere. I'm really happy for her, because I know she has been
struggling, and this means a lot.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   It was a pressure-packed afternoon for Burton, playing in the
final twosome with Sorenstam in the final major of the season. The
climax was set up when Burton, holding a two-stroke lead, bogeyed
No. 16 and fell to 17 under par, just one stroke ahead of
Sorenstam.
</P>
<P>
   At the par 5, 462-yard No. 17, both Burton and Sorenstam went
for the green in two shots. Sorenstam hit a powerful 7-wood
approach shot that got a good bounce and came to rest 25 feet from
the cup. Burton hit her 4-wood approach shot over the green and
into the rough, about 30 yards from the pin. Sorenstam was in
position for a possible eagle, while Burton needed an up-and-down
to make a birdie.
</P>
<P>
   But for Burton, who has confidence in her short game, the
situation was not intimidating. She hit a gorgeous chip shot within
5 feet of the cup, and then made her putt for birdie. Sorenstam's
eagle putt stopped a foot short, and she settled for a birdie to
remain one stroke behind.
</P>
<P>
   When the two players reached the par-4, 385-yard No. 18, Mallon
and King had yet to tee off. Sorenstam and Burton were forced to
wait about 10 minutes, and needless to say, the atmosphere was
tense.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I drank about six bottles of water,'' Burton said,
laughing. ``I had a little cotton mouth going.''
</P>
<P>
   Both players hit solid drives, but the nervousness showed on
their next shots. Sorenstam hit a poor 6-iron from 165 yards,
yanking it into the rough left of the green, about 20 yards from
the pin. Sorenstam bowed her head in disappointment after the shot.
</P>
<P>
   ``I needed a birdie, and I needed to get it close,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But Burton's approach shot was even worse. From the middle of
the fairway, she hit an awful 7-iron shot that sliced right, hit a
tree, then ricocheted back into the fairway, still about 60 yards
in front of the green. Burton had to regain her composure and rely
on her short game to get up and down again.
</P>
<P>
   Just before she prepared to hit her crucial chip shot, Burton's
caddie, Tim Atsedes, gave her encouragement.
</P>
<P>
   ``For two seconds there, I doubted myself,'' Burton said. ``Tim
said, `You've done this 100 times. You can hit this shot.'''
</P>
<P>
   Atsedes was right. Burton hit another superb chip within 8 feet.
But Sorenstam then almost chipped in for a birdie that would have
tied Burton, but her ball slid just past the hole. That left Burton
with her suspenseful final putt.
</P>
<P>
   The victory lifted her from No. 14 to No. 5 in the Solheim Cup
points standings, and the top 10 players receive an automatic spot
on the U.S. team that will face Europe in September. Earning a spot
on the Solheim Cup was one of Burton's goals for the season. To win
again was another. So for Burton, Sunday was a special day. And
after waiting five years to win, she planned to celebrate.
</P>
<P>
   ``After my last win, I went to the course the next day and beat
range balls for five hours,'' Burton said. ``This time, I'm going
to take it easy. Maybe do some fishing.''

GAILEY TAKES BLAME FOR GAFFES IN OPENER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN LYONS 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WICHITA FALLS, Texas _ Chan Gailey spent 3 1/2 hours yesterday
evaluating game film of his new team in the preseason opener. Yet
during all that time, as he painstakingly eyed each frame of the
club's 20-19 loss Friday night to the Seattle Seahawks, perhaps
Gailey's most significant assessment came of himself.
</P>
<P>
   Having spent much of his apprenticeship for the Cowboys' head
coaching job as an offensive assistant, the new Cowboys skipper
said if he is to improve he'll have to ``continually remind''
himself to pay more attention when the club is playing defense or
on special teams.
</P>
<P>
   Gailey also blamed himself for some of the 11 penalties called
on the Cowboys in the game at Texas Stadium. Three of the flags
were thrown when officials spotted the Cowboys with 12 defensive
players on the field.
</P>
<P>
   Asked how he graded his decision-making during his first game as
a pro head coach, Gailey said, ``It wasn't very good; we lost.''
</P>
<P>
   This is not the first time Gailey has had the final word on game
day. He spent five seasons as a head coach at Troy State, Samford
University and the Birmingham Fire of the World League. But Gailey
was an offensive assistant for eight of the previous 11 years
before coming to Dallas. No doubt during those years, he spent more
time preparing his offense for the next drive than watching the
action on the field. He said he had to think not to do that on
several occasions Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest problem was making sure I was paying attention
when the defense is on the field and when special teams are out
there, and for the penalty situations _ whether we want to take or
decline the penalty,'' said Gailey, who doubles as the team's
offensive coordinator. ``I kept reminding myself that I'm really
involved in that now. I know I am. But at the same time, when you
get caught up in offense, sometimes you lose sight of that, and
I've got to continually remind myself of that.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys were called for too many defensive players on the
field during one drive. A different player was involved each time,
Gailey said. Usually, the defensive assistants are charged with
employing the right players on the field at the right times. But
Gailey said he and his staff did a poor job of communicating when
it came time to substitute.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have different groups,'' he said, ``You've got a nickel
\Rdefense\S group, you've got a heavy group when \Rthe offense\S
goes to two tight ends. Then you've got your standard defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got all those different groups playing, and you've got
different sets of linebackers and defensive backs with each one.
And then we had injuries, and you're trying to play everybody in
there, and one guy's playing nickel in one, and he's playing dime
in the other, or he's not in on the heavy group, and it got
confusing, and we didn't get the right people on the field.''
</P>
<P>
   Gailey is confident that game-day gaffes like the ones Friday
night will not continue. He reminds anyone who seems concerned that
he has been a head coach before and is aware of the mental
gymnastics that it takes to be one.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've done it before, being a head coach,'' Gailey said. ``I've
got to get back into it. For the last four years, I paid attention
to nothing but the offense. It wasn't like I ignored \Rdefense,
special teams\S the other night. But I had to catch myself.''

Overseas duty can be ticket for NFL job 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

</P>
<P>
   Jon Kitna never thought he would visit the great cities of
Europe. He certainly had no idea anyone would ever refer to him as
``the quarterback of the future.''
</P>
<P>
   He was nobody, a clean-cut kid from a nowhere school with a good
arm but no hope of making it big in the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine his surprise, then, to be where he is today _ a seasoned
European traveler and the hot quarterback prospect for the Seattle
Seahawks, both thanks to NFL Europe, formerly known as the World
League of American Football.
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe it's not such a surprise.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember one day I was playing golf with my dad,'' Kitna
said, ``and telling him how weird it is for me to be in the NFL.
But the weirdest thing is that I can actually see myself as a
starter in this league for a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   So can Seahawks coach Dennis Erickson, the man who discovered
Kitna playing for an NAIA program at Central Washington, and in the
spring of 1997 decided to send him overseas to help him learn his
craft. Kitna returned as the World League's leading passer and the
most valuable player of its championship game, the World Bowl. He
threw for a league-record 401 yards to carry the Barcelona Dragons
past the Rhein Fire for the title.
</P>
<P>
   Even more important, he came back with a year's worth of
experience at the professional level and the confidence built from
his success. Both served him well on Dec. 14, when Warren Moon and
John Friesz went down with injuries, leaving Kitna to make his
first NFL start against the Oakland Raiders. All he did was lead
the Seahawks back from a 21-3 halftime deficit to a 22-21 victory,
which in turn led Erickson to tab him as the QB of the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question that playing in the World League was the
best thing that ever happened to Jon Kitna,'' Erickson said. ``He
learned a great deal about playing his position and about
himself.''
</P>
<P>
   With Moon holding out and threatening to retire, Kitna, 26, is
challenging Friesz for the No. 1 position this season.
</P>
<P>
   Kitna's rapid rise has made him the poster child for NFL Europe,
the example of what a year abroad can do for a young player.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, I got to see the world and almost got paid for it,'' said
Kitna, who earned $18,000 for his three months of work. ``They gave
us meals and a place to live about 100 yards from the beach and a
chance to play and get better. It was a great experience for me.''
</P>
<P>
   But his is not the only success story. Minnesota quarterback
Brad Johnson spent 1995 with the England Monarchs. Detroit's Scott
Mitchell played for the Orlando Thunder in 1992, the last year the
World League featured American teams. The Cowboys invited six
ex-World Leaguers to their camp, including backup quarterback Jason
Garrett (San Antonio, 1991), guard Everett McIver (England, 1996)
and linebacker/special teams hopeful K.D. Williams, who spent last
season as one of the stars for the Frankfurt Galaxy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a great place to be for guys like me,'' Williams said.
``It's like a stage, but the stage is set in a different country.
It gave me enough exposure for NFL teams to give me a chance to
work out for them.
</P>
<P>
   ``And the people were great. Frankfurt was the best city. There
big crowds there every game. They had a lot of respect for the game
of football.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, the Frankfurt fans, not to mention the
Galaxy's management, apparently had little respect for their German
rival, the Dusseldorf-based Rhein Fire. Those teams met three times
last spring, all nasty, intense struggles that drew the league's
largest attendance of the season. The Fire won two of the three,
including a 34-10 victory in the 1998 World Bowl before a
boisterous crowd of 47,546 at Waldstadion in Frankfurt.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those Frankfurt guys talk a lot of trash,'' said former Fire
defensive end Mike Croel, now in camp with the Seahawks. ``And they
treated us so bad. At the end of one of the games there, they
turned off the hot water in our locker room and hid our laundry.
I've never seen such bad sportsmanship. They made the Raiders look
like angels.''
</P>
<P>
   Croel knows all about that, having faced the Raiders twice a
year in five seasons with the Denver Broncos. He was the fourth
pick in the 1991 draft and was considered among the league's
hottest prospects, but he fizzled after the Broncos changed their
defensive scheme. He was out of football last fall. Now 29, Croel
was an anomaly in NFL Europe, a former star attempting to resurrect
his career among the young hopefuls.
</P>
<P>
   Once a speedy, pass-rushing linebacker, the 6-foot-3, 241-pound
veteran had to prove to NFL general managers that he could make the
switch to defensive end, where his skills seemed to be a better
fit. His performance in Europe, which included six sacks and five
passes deflected in 11 games, drew positive reviews, earning him a
spot in an NFL camp and a chance to win a job.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the only way for me to get back into the league,''
Croel said. ``If I wanted to get invited into someone's camp,
that's what I had to do. It wasn't humbling. Stuff happens in this
business. You do what you have to do. In my case, I just had to
show I could still be aggressive and let people know I still have
some game left in me.''
</P>
<P>
   That Croel wound up with the Seahawks is not surprising, given
Erickson's affinity for NFL Europe alumni. Seattle brought eight
former European players to camp this year, including the MVPs of
the past two World Bowls, Jim Arellanes and Kitna. Arellanes filled
in for injured starter Mike Quinn (now in Pittsburgh's camp) and
threw three touchdown passes for Rhein.
</P>
<P>
   Not all coaches and general managers are sold on NFL Europe.
Indianapolis general manager Bill Polian, for example, brought only
four former World League players to camp, none of whom has played
in Europe since 1996. That group includes kicker Cary Blanchard
(Sacramento, 1992), who is solidly entrenched after five NFL
seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``I sent a punter \RKevin Feighery\S there when I was with
Carolina and had a bad experience,'' Polian said. ``He went there
and actually got worse. They never even worked with him. Now, it
may not be fair to judge on that, but I'd want to see some results
before I sent someone over there. We'd rather the guys stay here
and work in our off-season program than go over there.''
</P>
<P>
   One thing on which Polian and Erickson do agree is that
quarterbacks stand to benefit from a year in NFL Europe far more
than any other position.
</P>
<P>
   ``Quarterbacks need to play,'' Polian said. ``Sitting on the
bench watching doesn't do them a lot of good. So, yes, for a young
quarterback, a guy like Kitna or \RSt. Louis' Will\S Furrer I'd say
there's probably some value in it.''
</P>
<P>
   Kitna doesn't have to be told that. He is convinced his year in
Europe made him a far better quarterback. And now he's ready for
bigger things.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest question about me, because I came from a small
college, was if I could do it against better athletes,'' he said.
``In the World League, I was able to show them what they wanted to
see.
</P>
<P>
   ``That got me the chance, and I want to take advantage of it.
I'm not happy being the third guy or the second guy here,'' he
said. ``I want to be the guy who leads this team to the playoffs. I
have visions of opening our new stadium in 2002 with a Super Bowl
ring.''

ONLY THE TURNOUT WASN'T FIRST CLASS

 By FRANK LITSKY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNIONDALE, N.Y. _ The competition generally ranged from good to
excellent. The athletes were happy and enjoyed the international
atmosphere without the choking tension of an Olympic Games.
Spectators liked the up-close looks at famous athletes.
</P>
<P>
   By most standards, the Goodwill Games, a scaled-down Olympics
that ended Sunday night after 15 days of competition in New York
City and Nassau County, were a success. There were many empty seats
_ Nassau Coliseum was less than half full for such favorites as
women's all-around gymnastics and the start of women's figure
skating _ but crowds were often enthusiastic.
</P>
<P>
   Ted Turner, the media magnate, created the Goodwill Games in
1986 to help break down Cold War barriers between the United States
and the Soviet Union. Now the games are more international, with
1,500 athletes from more than 60 nations competing here in 15
sports.
</P>
<P>
   The athletes were housed at big hotels, often with security
guards on every floor. They were well fed and, in some cases, well
paid. They seemed to enjoy one another's company, as witness a
wonderful television clip in which a Chinese female diver was
trying to teach an American diver, Erica Sorgi, how to whistle.
</P>
<P>
   As Mark Ruiz, another American diver, said: ``Over all, the
games were great. I had a great time and a lot of fun.''
</P>
<P>
   And Mike Plant, president of the Goodwill Games, said, ``The
Russian swimming coach said this is the first time his team has
really shown a lot of camaraderie and worked together toward a
common goal.''
</P>
<P>
   The games are owned by Turner Sports, part of Time Warner, the
media giant. The first three competitions _ in 1986, 1990 and 1994
_ lost a total of $109 million. These games lost money, too,
although not as much. But they did provide a nightly three hours of
prime-time programming (plus a three-hour repeat) for Turner
Broadcasting.
</P>
<P>
   Plant had a different spin.
</P>
<P>
   ``We always use the word `investment,''' he said at a news
conference to review the games. ``We provide an opportunity for
world-class athletes to compete.''
</P>
<P>
   These games certainly had world-class athletes, including
Michael Johnson, Marion Jones and Jackie Joyner-Kersee in track and
field, Alexander Popov and Jenny Thompson in swimming, Michelle
Kwan and Todd Eldredge in figure skating, Mia Hamm in soccer,
Dmitri Sautin in diving and Felix Savon in boxing. Some of them,
notably Johnson, received six-figure appearance and endorsement
fees, and all performed well in winning gold medals.
</P>
<P>
   The games had their moments of nationalism, especially when Iran
and Turkey wrestled. They had one awful moment when Sang Lan, a
17-year-old Chinese gymnastics champion, broke her neck performing
a routine practice vault and was paralyzed from midchest down.
</P>
<P>
   The empty seats did not seem to bother the organizers. Plant
said he expected a total ticket sale of 350,000 of the 550,000
seats available. Nassau County will be left with two world-class
facilities: the track-and-field and soccer complex here and the
swimming and diving complex a mile away in Eisenhower Park in East
Meadow.
</P>
<P>
   The 50-meter pool will be the site of next year's U.S. spring
championships.
</P>
<P>
   Fernando Scherer, an Olympic medalist from Brazil, called it
``the fastest pool I've ever been in.'' And Norbert Rozsa, a former
world record-holder in the breast stroke, said, ``I wish they built
pools like this back in Hungary.''
</P>
<P>
   To escape conflicts with the 2002 Olympic Winter Games and World
Cup soccer, the next Goodwill Games will be in 2001 in Brisbane,
Australia. They will last only 12 days and will be more compact.
The novel swimming format of round-robin dual meets, which led some
swimmers to swim two races within 10 minutes, will probably remain.
</P>
<P>
   At the closing celebration at Battery Park City in Manhattan,
Time Warner Chairman Gerald Levin and Turner, the vice chairman,
presented the Boys and Girls Clubs and UNICEF, the games'
designated charities, with checks for $1 million each. In all,
Plant said, the games have given $5 million to those groups.
</P>
<P>
   There was $5 million more in prize money for athletes, and for
some it was their only sports income of the year.
</P>
<P>
   For being part of the all-conquering U.S. women's swimming team,
Ashley Tappin earned $12,500.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unbelievable,'' she said. ``This money is going to be my car
payment.''

REYNOSO LEADS METS OVER DODGERS, 9-3 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JASON DIAMOS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Armando Reynoso had gone a year and a week between
major-league starts. Nine more days obviously did not hurt him.
</P>
<P>
   In his second start of the season for the Mets, Reynoso allowed
two singles in seven innings in a 9-3 rout of the Los Angeles
Dodgers Sunday at Shea Stadium. The Mets took the lead for good
when they scored five runs, all unearned, off the former Met Brian
Bohanon in the third inning. Butch Huskey drove in two of the runs
with his 12th homer; he left the game in the fifth inning after
injuring a hamstring running the bases.
</P>
<P>
   The only run Reynoso allowed was unearned, too. Reynoso (2-0), a
32-year-old right-hander, who missed more than a year with elbow
and shoulder problems before starting on July 24, has not allowed
an earned run in 15 innings with the Mets.
</P>
<P>
   Isn't that kind of surprising? Mike Piazza was asked.
``Absolutely,'' Piazza said. ``It looked like he didn't miss a beat
at all.''
</P>
<P>
   The victory was the Mets' 10th in 14 games. Coupled with
Colorado's victory over the Chicago Cubs, it put the Mets (58-50),
three games back in the wild-card race.
</P>
<P>
   For the moment, Mets manager Bobby Valentine has a pleasant
problem. Valentine has seven legitimate starters, and six of them
are in his rotation now for at least one turn.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not for the rest of the season,'' Valentine said. ``But I
think it's needed right now.''
</P>
<P>
   He sees the need to give his starters a little extra rest. And
with Reynoso, Al Leiter, Rick Reed, Bobby Jones, Hideo Nomo, Masato
Yoshii and Willie Blair on his staff, he has too many starters to
begin with. At least for now. Blair, who is pitching in relief, may
have been acquired from Arizona with the thought that he could be
traded again, possibly in a waiver deal to the Baltimore Orioles or
Cincinnati Reds.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever happens with the rotation, Reynoso just wants to start.
After his first outing, he was briefly available out of the bullpen
until Valentine chose to go with six starters. ``Better six days'
rest than a year,'' Reynoso said Sunday of a six-man rotation. ``A
year is too long.''
</P>
<P>
   It did not look that way. Reynoso allowed a run-scoring single
by Gary Sheffield in the first; it was six more innings before the
Dodgers got another hit.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets, meanwhile, tied the score in the bottom of the first
when Piazza's sacrifice fly drove in Tony Phillips.
</P>
<P>
   Reynoso and Phillips then keyed the five-run third. Reynoso
reached base when his hard smash skipped past a backhanded stab by
the Dodgers' rookie third baseman, Adrian Beltre. With a 3-2 count,
Phillips drew a walk to give the Mets runners on first and second
with nobody out.
</P>
<P>
   Edgardo Alfonzo followed with a hard shot to center field. Raul
Mondesi caught up with the ball after a long run, but it skipped
out of his glove, and John Olerud came up with the bases loaded.
</P>
<P>
   Olerud delivered a sacrifice fly for a 2-1 lead. (He later
extended his hitting streak to 16 games.) Piazza grounded to third
to advance the runners. Brian McRae was then hit by a pitch on the
left wrist _ but McRae acted as if he had not been hit and
continued his at-bat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't going anywhere,'' he said. ``I couldn't let Bo get
off the hook like that. We've been talking stuff to each other for
the last three days. I was just hoping he didn't tell me to go to
first, because I wasn't going.''
</P>
<P>
   The plate umpire, Charlie Williams, let McRae continue, and he
grounded a two-run single past Bohanon for a 4-1 lead. Two pitches
later, Huskey hit his first home run since July 9. The Mets had
five unearned runs in the inning on two hits and two errors, and a
6-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Reynoso took it from there, though he was uncharacteristically
wild, walking four batters. ``I didn't have the best control
today,'' he said. ``But I made the good pitch at the right time.''
</P>
<P>
   Valentine said: ``He kept them off stride. He mixed the ball in
and out. He doesn't give in. He either makes his pitch or no pitch.
Armando threw a lot of pitches today. And he looked good throwing
them all.''
</P>
<P>
   Reynoso even added a fourth-inning single for a little gravy.
</P>
<P>
   ``He knows how to pitch,'' Piazza said. ``Obviously, he knows
how to hit, too.''

SEC SAYS INCOMNET EXECUTIVE HID TRADING 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)  (js) 
 By SHARON R. KING   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Federal regulators have accused a former top executive of a
small long-distance telephone company of filing false documents to
conceal his trading in the company's stock.
</P>
<P>
   In a lawsuit filed on Thursday in U.S. District Court in Los
Angeles, the Securities and Exchange Commission said that Sam
Schwartz, a former chief executive and chairman of the company,
Incomnet &UR;  &LR; Inc., bought about 1.1 million shares of Incomnet stock
and sold about 900,000 shares from June 1994 through July 1995
without disclosing the transactions in a timely manner.
</P>
<P>
   Schwartz, 58, caused Incomnet to report falsely in filings with
the commission that Incomnet's board had given him written approval
to set up a personal trading account, according to the complaint.
Schwartz is also accused of prompting the company to issue an
erroneous press release to back up the claim.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Schwartz is accused of causing Incomnet to issue
two statements in January 1995 denying that the company was being
investigated by the SEC, even though executives knew of the
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The complaint seeks to keep Schwartz, a resident of Encino,
Calif., from committing future violations and seeks an unspecified
monetary penalty.
</P>
<P>
   `` Schwartz was doing undisclosed trading to push up the price''
of Incomnet shares, said Lisa Gok, assistant regional director of
enforcement for the commission in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Company insiders are required to disclose any trading activity.
In addition, when Schwartz's ownership surpassed 5 percent of the
total shares of Incomnet, he was required to disclose that his
intentions had changed from owning the stock as an investment to
active trading, an SEC official said.
</P>
<P>
   Schwartz's lawyer, Sheldon Jaffe of Los Angeles, challenged the
commission's contentions, saying Sunday that board members knew
about the trading.
</P>
<P>
   In a 1995 filing with the SEC, Schwartz said he had been buying
and selling stock in an effort ``to defend the price of the
company's stock from the short-sellers.''
</P>
<P>
   Incomnet, a long-distance telephone services reseller based in
Woodland Hills, Calif., consented on Thursday to an SEC order to
desist from violating federal security laws. The company and two
former officers, Joel Greenberg and Stephen Caswell, did not admit
or deny any wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   Telephone calls to Incomnet seeking comment were not returned.

RALPH NEWMAN, AUTHORITY ON CIVIL WAR, DIES AT 86 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ill., Colo.)  (lb) 
 By ROBERT McG. THOMAS Jr.   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ralph Newman, an unlikely bookstore proprietor and even less
likely Civil War scholar who made a name for himself specializing
in Abraham Lincoln and almost ruined it befriending Richard Nixon,
died on July 23 at a hospital near his home in Chicago. He was 86.
</P>
<P>
   It may seem strange that a college dropout would deem himself
qualified to write or edit more than a dozen historical books,
among them ``The American Iliad'' (1947) and ``Lincoln for the
Ages'' (1959). But Newman, who was encouraged by Carl Sandburg, the
Pulitzer Prize-winning poet and Lincoln biographer, knew that after
his single term at Northwestern University he had more formal
education than Lincoln and Sandburg put together.
</P>
<P>
   Newman's Abraham Lincoln Book Shop became a magnet for Civil War
scholars and buffs and a Chicago tourist attraction, and the Civil
War Round Table he helped found in 1940 spawned hundreds of similar
discussion groups across the country and abroad. He also became a
highly visible civic leader.
</P>
<P>
   He served as president of the Chicago Public Library's board for
more than a decade, as chairman of the Illinois Sesquicentennial
Commission in 1968 and, to his special delight, as chairman of the
Illinois Pavilion at the 1964-65 New York World's Fair.
</P>
<P>
   Newman commissioned the lifelike Disney model of Lincoln that
became one of the fair's main attractions, selected the excerpts
from Lincoln's speeches that were ``spoken'' by the model during
the 10-minute show, and sat next to Pope Paul VI through two
performances.
</P>
<P>
   In the city of big shoulders, Newman became known for the size
of his paunch. As he grew older and rounder, it became harder and
harder to imagine that he had once been a promising athlete.
</P>
<P>
   A native of Chicago whose father operated a cigar store on the
West Side, Newman apparently had little truck with books as a
youth. He grew up dreaming of becoming a major-league baseball
player, but after he dropped out of college and spent two
minor-league seasons among heavy-hitting farm boys, an injury
helped convince him that his destiny lay elsewhere. It just took
him a while to discover what it was.
</P>
<P>
   In 1932, after a brief, boring fling in Depression-era banking,
Newman was walking along a street one day when he had his epiphany.
Intrigued by a going-out-of-business sign in the window of a
used-book store, he went inside and learned he could buy the entire
stock for $10,000.
</P>
<P>
   Newman may not have had a previous interest in books, but as a
21-year-old former bank teller he knew how to count. And when he
figured out that the asking price worked out to something like 6
cents a book, he returned to the bank, persuaded some of his former
colleagues to lend him the money, and bought the store.
</P>
<P>
   Reopening the store as Home of Books, he started cutting prices
by 75 percent and created such a buying stampede that he was able
to repay the loan plus 100 percent interest within four months.
</P>
<P>
   Moving the store to the Loop a few years later, Newman, a
gregarious man whose customers tended to become his friends, fell
in with a newspaper crowd that included Ben Hecht; Lloyd Lewis, the
managing editor of The Chicago Daily News; and Sandburg, a former
Daily News reporter and columnist.
</P>
<P>
   At the urging of Lewis and Sandburg he converted the store to a
shop specializing in Lincoln and the Civil War. In 1940 he renamed
it the Abraham Lincoln Book Shop and joined a dozen of his
customers in establishing the first Civil War Round Table.
</P>
<P>
   With Lewis and Sandburg operating as volunteer publicists, the
store, which also dealt in Lincoln autographs and papers, soon
received reams of national publicity, and Newman was recognized as
an authority on Lincoln and the Civil War.
</P>
<P>
   After selling the store in 1984 to a partner, who still operates
it, Newman, who over the years claimed to have sold books to every
president from Herbert Hoover to Bill Clinton, continued to operate
a sideline business as an appraiser of historic documents,
including the presidential papers of Harry S. Truman, Lyndon B.
Johnson and, much to his later anguish, Richard Nixon.
</P>
<P>
   In 1975, as an offshoot of the Watergate investigation, a jury
found Newman guilty of having falsely sworn that Nixon had made a
charitable donation of his papers before a law took effect severely
limiting the tax deductions for such gifts.
</P>
<P>
   Newman, who was fined $10,000, told his lawyer, Edward Bennett
Williams, that he was afraid the incident would ruin his appraising
business. Williams assured him that because of the publicity the
business would double.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was wrong,'' Newman said years later. ``It tripled.''
</P>
<P>
   Newman, who was married three times, is survived by his wife,
Patricia; two daughters from a previous marriage, Carol Parry Fox
of New York and Maxine Brandenberg of Denver; and two
grandchildren.

REDEFINING HEROISM WITH SPIELBERG AND PVT. RYAN
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By EDWARD ROTHSTEIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   One almost has to avert one's eyes from the chronicle of
carnage: the warrior with a hewn neck bone, hot blood flooding down
his eyes; a skewered skull, mouth gaping, blowing convulsive sprays
of blood; bodies torn asunder in tender, vulnerable spots _ navel,
groin, throat.
</P>
<P>
   The battle on Omaha Beach in Steven Spielberg's ``Saving Private
Ryan''? No, the Trojan war in Homer's ``Iliad.'' But both accounts,
separated by more than two millenniums, make it impossible to treat
warfare casually, showing it in all its brutish force. Both are
also haunted by another conflict in which the individual warrior is
harnessed to a communal will, in which the private is asked to
sacrifice itself for the sake of the public.
</P>
<P>
   This is not a conflict many late-20th-century Americans have
much patience for. How many citizens would automatically submit to
public demands that innocent youths be turned into bloodied pulp?
Our instincts of distrust have been finely honed.
</P>
<P>
   That is why, when the ``Private Ryan'' battle scene ends, and
Spielberg brings us into a room full of typists preparing letters
announcing soldiers' deaths with honorific (if not Homeric)
formulas, we wince again, ready to dismiss impersonal expressions
of compassion. ``Private Ryan'' has already been hailed as an
anti-war film, and it is easy to see why it has been misunderstood
as one.
</P>
<P>
   Actually ``Private Ryan'' is not anti-war any more than the
``Iliad.'' Something else is happening, which is one reason it has
had such an extraordinary impact.
</P>
<P>
   The bulletin boards on America Online are full of veterans'
testimonials of gratitude for the film: accounts by a niece who now
understands her uncle, or a son who now pays tribute to his father.
This kind of sentiment has become rare in America, where even
Memorial Day parades are often treated as quaint
self-congratulatory gatherings.
</P>
<P>
   Something is being restored in this film. But here is where
things get complicated because, while honoring heroism, it does not
really revive the old vision of sacrifice for one's country. Though
``Ryan'' begins and ends with images of an American flag, the
colors are washed out as if it had lost its freshness. There is no
confusing this film with earlier World War II epics.
</P>
<P>
   Consider, in contrast, one of the films Spielberg admires,
William Wellman's 1949 ``Battleground,'' a re-creation of the
wintry Battle of the Bulge, in which icy foxholes provided homes
for thousands of frozen corpses, wounded soldiers were hastily
patched up and returned to combat, and bad weather prevented air
support for the pummeled infantry. ``Skip the commercials,'' quips
a soldier in response to morale-boosting chatter.
</P>
<P>
   But then, in the end, a chaplain speaks to the decimated troops:
``Was this trip necessary?'' He insists it was, reminding the
soldiers that Hitler left no choice, that the alternative would
have been still more horrific, that a purpose was being served.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, that lesson _ that public need transcends private
suffering _ seems dramatically pasted on ``Battleground,'' a
reminder to its viewers more than to its trembling characters. But
it is the kind of reminder that World War II demands. It is the
premise on which the war was fought. It also provides the shifting
terrain on which World War II films have waged their battles over
the last half-century.
</P>
<P>
   At times, as in the 1962 film ``The Longest Day,'' that
justification is taken for granted even when Allied foul-ups lead
to wholesale massacres. On the other hand, it seems hardly
acknowledged at all in the 1977 film ``A Bridge Too Far,'' in which
the Allied command is so vain and reckless that the battle becomes
a monument to hypocrisy.
</P>
<P>
   What happened in between the two films was, of course, the
Vietnam War. That weaned many Americans away from patriotism,
sometimes replacing it with a ready-made cynicism. In ``Patton''
(1970), George C. Scott, as World War II's great prima donna-ish
general, stands in front of a gargantuan American flag, dismissing
the very idea of individuality and reciting homilies we are meant
to dismiss as crankily fascistic:
</P>
<P>
   ``No poor bastard ever won a war by dying for his country. He
won it by making the other poor bastard die for his country.''
</P>
<P>
   We are meant to think of Patton as a mad genius by the movie's
end, one whose principles are nightmares from which we should try
to awaken. It is into that breach that Spielberg leaped, seeking to
rescue the veteran from such cultural skepticism. But he did it in
a peculiar way, redefining heroism by meticulously chronicling its
noble sacrifices, without fully restoring traditional patriotism.
</P>
<P>
   In the midst of the quest to find Pvt. Ryan behind enemy lines,
for example, the recurring question is whether that one man is
worth the sacrifice of the eight sent to do the job. But what does
this mean? What if Ryan isn't worth it? Here, the justification for
sacrifice is not an idea, a country or a battle against Nazism. It
is an individual. The private becomes the measure of the public.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Hanks' soldier even preserves his private life from view as
if it were a precious terrain to be defended. Is saving Pvt. Ryan a
mission worth pursuing? ``If that earns me the right to get back to
my wife,'' he insists, ``then that's my mission.''
</P>
<P>
   The justification is personal (and the public goal may even be
mistrusted). Screenwriter Robert Rodat has spelled this out.
``Patriotism,'' he has said, ``ultimately has to do with one's
responsibility to family, to neighbors and to those one fights
alongside in the military.'' Thus, ``Private Ryan'' privatizes
patriotism.
</P>
<P>
   This is a remarkable change and not without problems. For many
in Spielberg's generation and younger, it has become difficult to
imagine surrendering individuality before the demands of a state.
Today, the tendency is to protect private prerogatives ardently and
to suspect public demands aggressively. When the film transfers
those attitudes back to World War II _ a just and necessary war
that required immense private sacrifice for public good _ the
perspective can be jarring.
</P>
<P>
   It is difficult for those of us who have never risked death at
the command of others to know this for sure, but perhaps in the
midst of combat the preoccupation with private life is the only
sentiment possible. It is also the main sentiment that armies have
had to quash. It may be that the enormities of war can only be
grasped at the individual level, but at the same time wars can only
be fought _ even just wars _ by subsuming the individual.
</P>
<P>
   There are hints of this in the ``Iliad'' as well: Nearly every
death is individuated, but the greatest violation is excessive
individuation. The epic is not a tale of war but a tale of
Achilles' rage, his refusal to join battle out of injured pride. He
sets himself apart from his compatriots ``like some lion/going his
own barbaric way, giving in to his power,/his brute force and wild
pride.'' Homer, though, honors a different kind of heroism in which
the private and public become inseparable.
</P>
<P>
   The heroism of Homer's ``Saving Beautiful Helen'' is not the
heroism of Spielberg's ``Saving Private Ryan.'' Have sacrifice and
patriotism become purely private because we cannot accept them any
other way? Perhaps. But the widespread impact of the film suggests
that having saved the private, Spielberg may have begun to affect
the public as well.

ALDIZA, 11-1, USES 11-POUND EDGE TO WIN 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JENNY KELLNER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SARATOGA SPRINGS, N.Y. _ For trainer Shug McGaughey, the logic
was irresistible.
</P>
<P>
   His 4-year-old filly, Aldiza, had just one victory this year, in
an allowance race. But she had two career victories at Saratoga
Race Course, with two seconds. Then there was the matter of weight.
If she ran in the Grade I $250,000 Go for Wand Stakes Sunday,
Aldiza would get 11 pounds from Allen Paulson's top mare, Escena, a
winner of four straight graded stakes.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, McGaughey thought, there really was no other place to
go.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought, if we're right about this, we'll be really, really
right,'' McGaughey said. ``Escena is a great filly and she's having
a great year, but getting weight like that, sometimes you can sneak
up on her.''
</P>
<P>
   He was right. Edging to the front in the final strides after a
stretchlong battle, Aldiza beat the prohibitive favorite by a nose
for her first Grade I victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``With a great mare like that, you never think you really have
them, but I just kept the pressure on Escena and it worked out
great,'' said Mike Smith, who also won Saturday's Test aboard
Jersey Girl. ``It's been a great weekend _ let's keep it going.''
</P>
<P>
   Finishing third, three lengths back, was Tomisue's Delight, with
Runup the Colors, Panama Canal, Mil Kilates and Verinha completing
the order of finish.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first loss for Escena since March, when she finished
second in the Rampart at Gulfstream. From there she went on to win
the Apple Blossom at Oaklawn, the Louisville Breeders' Cup and the
Fleur de Lis at Churchill Downs and the Vanity at Hollywood under
jockey Jerry Bailey.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's been traveling a lot _ we started with her early and
tried to win what we could,'' said Escena's trainer, Bill Mott.
``There were no excuses for her.''
</P>
<P>
   Aldiza, overlooked at more than 11-1 by the cap-giveaway-day
crowd of 47,607, returned $25 for a $2 bet to win as she completed
the mile and an eighth in 1:47 4/5.
</P>
<P>
   It was the second victory in four starts this year for Aldiza,
who is owned by Helen Alexander, following a
one-and-one-sixteenth-mile allowance at Belmont on July 5. Sunday's
Go for Wand was her first two-turn start on the dirt, but McGaughey
had confidence in his filly even before the undefeated Mossflower
was withdrawn with a slight ankle injury.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's a tough, tough filly and with her wind problems _ she's
had two minor procedures to help her breathing _ I just told Mike
to let her run her race,'' said McGaughey, who has won the Go for
Wand five times, including the 1995 edition with Heavenly Prize.
``It was the right decision.''

AS MORE NONVIOLENT FELONS ARE RELEASED, PAROLE IS DENIED TO VIOLENT
INMATES 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By RAYMOND HERNANDEZ   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ In a radical change in how New York state uses
its clogged prisons, the administration of Gov. George Pataki has
quietly been pursuing a two-pronged strategy of releasing
nonviolent felons, mostly into drug treatment, while increasingly
denying parole for violent felons.
</P>
<P>
   The strategy reverses a trend that dates to the early 1970s,
when the state under Gov. Nelson Rockefeller imposed among the
stiffest sentences in the nation for low-level drug offenders, many
of them addicts, and others convicted of nonviolent felonies.
</P>
<P>
   For a generation, the number of state inmates imprisoned for
drug crimes grew at a frantic pace, rising to nearly one-third of
the prison population. But now that number has leveled off, and
even begun to drop. At the same time, the Pataki administration has
worked through the state parole board to reduce significantly the
number of violent offenders who are granted parole.
</P>
<P>
   The policies, put into effect over the last three years, are
integral components of Pataki's larger goal of returning the state
prisons to their historic mission of housing mostly violent
criminals. The administration estimates that the influx of violent
felons into the state prison system is likely to accelerate with
the state Legislature's passage of the governor's proposal to end
parole for first-time violent felons.
</P>
<P>
   ``The governor's position,'' said James Flateau, a spokesman for
the state's Department of Correctional Services, ``has always been
that prison space should be reserved for violent criminals who must
serve each and every day of longer sentences. But at the same time,
he is looking for ways to allow certain nonviolent drug offenders
to get the treatment they need to get out of prison earlier.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Reppetto, the president of the Citizens Crime Commission
of New York City, a private organization, said the Pataki
administration was giving the criminal justice system, and the
public, what it wanted.
</P>
<P>
   Between 1982 and 1996, the number of nonviolent inmates in the
state, many of them drug offenders sentenced under the
Rockefeller-era laws, increased steadily, to 33,865 from 8,297. But
between 1996 and 1997, that figure declined for the first time in
15 years, by nearly 1,000, as the Pataki administration
aggressively used a variety of early-release programs.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the 19-member New York State Parole Board,
under the growing influence of the governor's appointees, began
denying parole to inmates at a significant rate. In 1997, for
example, the board denied parole to 37 percent of the violent
felons who applied for parole, compared with 17 percent in 1991
under Pataki's predecessor, Gov. Mario Cuomo.
</P>
<P>
   But the administration's policies have their critics. Robert
Gangi, the executive director of the Correctional Association of
New York, a group that monitors the state's prisons, called the
administration's efforts deeply flawed. For one thing, he said, the
administration is compromising the independence of the parole board
by pressuring its members into making decisions based on political
considerations rather than the merits of the individual cases.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   He also sharply questioned the administration's commitment to
reducing the number of nonviolent drug offenders in the state's
system. Gangi said that if the governor were genuine about his
desire to reduce that population of inmates, he would urge his
Republican allies in the Legislature to drop their longstanding
opposition to legislation that would overhaul the stiff sentencing
laws passed during the Rockefeller administration.
</P>
<P>
   Under the 1973 Rockefeller drug laws, judges must abide by rigid
sentencing guidelines that require long prison terms for drug
offenses, even for relatively minor ones like possessing a small
quantity of narcotics. Under another law passed that year, the
sentences increase sharply when a person is convicted of a second
felony within 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of 1997, nearly 22,000 of the state's nearly 33,000
nonviolent inmates were imprisoned under the Rockefeller laws, at a
cost of about $600 million a year, or $27,000 an inmate.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Pataki administration has quietly found ways around
those long mandatory drug sentences, it cautions against a
wholesale loosening of the drug laws. Many of the criminals
convicted under those laws, officials say, have prior convictions
or are guilty of large-scale drug dealing, not the penny-ante drug
crimes often cited by opponents of the laws.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the Pataki administration has over the last three
years placed nearly 18,432 nonviolent inmates, mostly addicts and
other low-level drug offenders, into early-release programs, like
vocational training, drug treatment and educational courses. Had
those inmates been required to serve their minimum sentences, 4,788
of them would still have been in prison at the beginning of this
year, according to an analysis by state correctional officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we are doing is putting incentives into the system for
nonviolent offenders to rehabilitate themselves,'' said Katherine
Lapp, the commissioner of criminal justice services.
</P>
<P>
   As for violent offenders, the administration has used the parole
board as a tool for managing that population. With control over the
board's budget and the ability to appoint its members, the governor
has nudged the board into increasingly denying violent felons early
release.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, for instance, 37 percent of first-time violent felons
were denied parole, compared with 21 percent in 1994, the year
before Pataki took office as governor. Because of the longer
sentences, the number of people in state prisons for committing
violent felonies has gradually increased despite the historic drop
in violent crime. By contrast, the board approved initial parole
requests for 80 percent of the nonviolent felons who applied for
early release in 1997.

SEX RESEARCH CENTER BRINGS PROSTITUTES, PORNOGRAPHERS AND
PROFESSORES TOGETHER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SHARLINE CHIANG  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NORTHRIDGE, Calif. -- The Center for Sex Research might be a bit
of a letdown for someone hoping for titillation.
</P>
<P>
   It is housed in a plain office decorated with light blue walls,
a few bookshelves and a computer. On a table sits a framed picture
of director James Elias, 58, playing with his grandchildren and
another of his wife Veronica, a sociology professor at California
State University, Northridge.
</P>
<P>
   The humble office in a CSUN tower is a perfect metaphor for the
way the innovative but low key center and the 20 academics who are
its members have gone about their business the last 30 years in
this &UR;  &LR; San Fernando Valley suburb of Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Quietly, the center has been working toward becoming a Kinsey
Institute of the West, presenting global gatherings to discuss such
topics as prostitution and cross-dressing, opening eyes to the
sexual practices of Americans in the 1990s in much the same way
Alfred Kinsey revealed the sexual behavior of Middle America in the
1950s.
</P>
<P>
   The center's members are single-handedly redefining sex
research. Take for example its next project: a World Pornography
Conference starting Thursday at the Universal City Sheraton.
</P>
<P>
   Up to 750 professors, researchers, First Amendment lawyers,
adult film actors and producers are booked to convene at the
Sheraton, right around the corner from the more mainstream
Universal Studios.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Researchers) used to all sit around talking with each other
and they were basically pretty boring,'' Elias said. ``All of us
were the same people, with similar points of view. We decided why
not bring in all the players?''
</P>
<P>
   It's a far cry from the staid, academic conferences the center
once staged.
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago, in attempt to break with traditional forums,
Elias began bringing real-life subjects such as sex-industry
workers and transsexuals under the same roof as academics.
</P>
<P>
   The center's pornography conference will draw prominent players
in the sex industry from the San Fernando Valley, the world's
leading producer of pornographic motion pictures, and beyond. The
center relies heavily for funding on $175 tickets for the
conference.
</P>
<P>
   Topics include a real ``Boogie Nights''; panels led by porn
stars Nina Hartley and Candida Royalle; pornography, cyberspace and
the First Amendment; gay porn, women and pornography _ victims or
visionaries?
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're doing is mainstreaming marginal areas of society
and focusing people to look,'' Elias said.
</P>
<P>
   Elias began as a researcher 30 years ago at the Kinsey Institute
for Research in Sex, Gender and Reproduction at Indiana University.
</P>
<P>
   ``My father would never come to visit my office,'' Elias said.
``He would wait downstairs. He didn't want to know (what was going
on). And my wife's father was a farmer. He said, `What am I
supposed to say about my son-in-law?' ''
</P>
<P>
   The institute, founded by Alfred C. Kinsey in 1947, brought
discussions about human sexuality to the forefront with its studies
based on 18,000 sexual histories of men and women gathered from
face-to-face interviews.
</P>
<P>
   The Kinsey Institute is sending representatives to Universal
City.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they're very innovative and in a sense blazing
something of a trail,'' said Kinsey director John Bancroft. ``I'm
not sure something like this is being done anywhere else.''
</P>
<P>
   CSUN officials acknowledged getting some complaints about the
center, often worrying about whether state funds are used. They're
not.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a resident of Northridge I think there are some topics best
left alone,'' said Dick Hardman, executive director of the
Northridge Chamber of Commerce.
</P>
<P>
   ``It legitimizes issues such as pornography, which I don't think
we, as a community, need to study or give legitimacy.''
</P>
<P>
   Legitimacy is exactly what adult entertainment advocates are
hoping the conference will help them get.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are issues that need to be discussed,'' said Jane
Hamilton, director with Chatsworth-based VCA Pictures, one of the
largest porn producers in the world. Hamilton is also a former porn
actress.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're living in the past and it's wishful thinking if you
don't think it's in the mainstream. It's a huge part of society.''
</P>
<P>
   Will Jarvis, co-organizer of next week's conference, wants to
focus on the issue of pornography industry workers. He is chairman
of the Erotic Entertainers Guild, a national union for the adult
entertainment industry, and a member of Free Speech Coalition, the
industry's largest advocacy group.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was very adamant that this conference be about the sex
workers, about their lives and opinions and that their voices are
heard,'' he said. ``Because, to be blunt, they work with their
(body parts) and that's how they make their living.''
</P>
<P>
   Elias invited anti-pornography activists to attend, but none
accepted.
</P>
<P>
   Days before the conference, Elias was flooded with requests for
tickets but the only media interest has come from MTV.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not interested in publicity,'' Elias said. ``The problem
is a lot of times what people look at is the spin. Last year, at
the prostitution conference, the media wanted to interview the
Happy Hooker, no one wanted to interview the justice of Canada.''

DEMISE OF THE COMMUNE MOVEMENT IS BLAMED ON EXCESSES
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn.: Vt.)   (jw) 
 By SALLY JOHNSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST BRATTLEBORO, Vt. _ A gaggle of aging hippies gathered here
over the weekend to assess what went right _ and wrong _ with the
commune movement that brought them ``back to the land'' of southern
Vermont 30 years ago. They concluded that theirs was a radical
social experiment that died by its own hand, impaled on its
excesses.
</P>
<P>
   The occasion for their self-criticism was a conference,
sponsored by the University of Vermont, at the West Village Meeting
House, a stone's throw from Guilford, the mecca of the commune
movement that began in the late 1960s with the influx of
disaffected urban and suburban youths, seeking self-sufficiency,
unfettered freedom and an alternative to the nuclear family. The
conference attracted about 50 people, many who had joined the
movement at the time.
</P>
<P>
   In its brief heyday, the movement in southeastern Vermont
included a loose network of communes clustered around the towns of
Guilford and Putney, encompassing the Red Clover Collective, the
Johnson's Pastures Commune, Packer Corners and the Montague Farm. A
few of the communes, where people lived together as an extended
family, still exist, although in modified form.
</P>
<P>
   The glue for the conference was the posthumous publication of
the book ``Communal Organization and Social Transition'' (Peter
Lang, 1997) by sociologist Barry Laffan that documents the life and
times of the counterculture over 30 months at the end of the '60s.
The book is one of the first ethnographies to deal with that brief
period of American culture.
</P>
<P>
   The quest for a utopia soon turned into a self-destructive orgy
of excess, many participants concluded, culminating symbolically in
the fire that razed the big house at the Johnson's Pastures
Commune, by far the largest of the communes. The blaze, on April
16, 1970, killed four people.
</P>
<P>
   Chuck Light, a witness and member of the so-called J.P. commune
at the time, recalled during a panel discussion that the fire
started when, after a night of drinking and drugs, someone tipped
over a candle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was living in a hovel in the back of a truck at the time,''
Light said. ``We heard screaming and came running; people were
leaping out of second-story windows. The old wooden house went up
in minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   That blaze, he concluded, ``became a central symbol of the
movement, symbolic of the personal fires and conflicts that were
going on around us and among us.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The communes inspired several spinoffs, including the Free Farm
in Putney, intended as a place where anyone could grow food.
</P>
<P>
   But ``it was more about making political statements than about
farming,'' said Robert Houriet, who moved to more structured
communes in northern Vermont and is now an organic farmer in
Hardwick. ``The Free Farm was in plain view of a building where the
local Democrats met, and they got offended by all the weeds and the
bare-breasted women. Eventually, there was an ugly confrontation
between hippies and an armed vigilante group, led by the local
sheriff.''
</P>
<P>
   Even within the movement itself, however, the patterns of the
broader society still held, said Howard Lieberman, a commune member
who became a corporate headhunter. Lieberman, who now lives in
Minnesota, said that he and Laffan ``spent years trying to puzzle
through the class distinctions.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Red Clover Collective was the educated, affluent kids,''
Lieberman said. ``The people at the Free Farm were middle-class
kids, emulating the Red Clover hippies, and the J.P. was the Ellis
Island of the commune movement, drawing people with nowhere to go
and nothing else to do.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Johnson's Pastures and its membership policies, or lack
thereof, became the epitome of the movement in its extreme. The
former landowner, Michael Carpenter, a silent, bearded man who
attended the weekend sessions, set an open-door policy, refusing to
turn away anyone.
</P>
<P>
   The result, said Light, was that ``during the summer of 1969,
somewhere between 800 and 1,000 people passed through the J.P. Lots
of them would come in buses. The place became a slum. The class
differences were very relevant; the first communards had shared
values and education, but it quickly sank to the lowest common
denominator _ the criminal element. What happened at the J.P. was a
colossal failure.''
</P>
<P>
   Others disagreed with that assessment. Verandah Porche, a poet
and a past and current member of the smaller Packer Corners
commune, said she ``admired the spirit and generosity.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Somebody had to try it,'' Ms. Porche said. ``I had the luxury
of sending along the people I didn't want at our house down the
road to his house.''
</P>
<P>
   What she remembered from those early years was a utopian life on
an old farm ``with a blooming peach orchard'' and mortgage payments
of $227.10 a month. Her memories were of a life of generosity and
connection, both among the communards and with the local farm
families. ``Their kids didn't want to hear the old stories about
making cheese and sap beer,'' said Ms. Porche, ``but we did. We ate
that stuff up. We were in a listening mode.''
</P>
<P>
   Marty Jezer, a co-founder of Packer Corners, blamed the failure
of the movement on the profound conflict within the counterculture.
``We had a big cider press operation at Packer Corners,'' Jezer
recalled, ``and I remember being up on top of the press one day,
feeding in apples to make cider. A bunch of hippies had come by to
help, but instead they were dancing around the press, throwing
apples at each other. It wasn't much help. We had an impractical
but noble vision that was constantly undermined by people who came
just to play.''
</P>
<P>
   In all, Houriet concluded, the important lesson of the commune
movement was that ``open-ended, anarchistic communities didn't work
because of problems with leadership, with land ownership, the role
of drugs and booze, plus internal conflicts among the members.
There was a lot of trauma involved, and not just from chemicals.
The movement opened a Pandora's box of the liberated self, and the
trauma proceeded from the inability of people to deal with
themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   If Johnson's Pastures went up in flames, he said, ``many
communes dissolved with a whimper as people just drifted away.''
</P>
<P>
   The later, more successful communes, he said, were a result of
lessons learned in the early movement: ``that there has to be some
leadership and decision-making, some control of membership, that
you can't sell drugs to people in town, go skinny-dipping in the
town pond and offend your neighbors.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, all these years later, Houriet's eyes filled with tears
and his voice choked up. ``There was a brief, shining moment when
we knew it could work,'' he said, scanning the panel of his fellow
communards. ``We knew it could work, but we blew it.''

<P>
   Dear Diary:
</P>
<P>
   As an artist about to leave on a long trip to Italy, I called a
storage company to have someone pack the artwork in my studio. The
packer arrived the next day with stacks of flattened cardboard and
balls of twine. I went back to my easel as he began unfolding the
pieces of cardboard and fitting them to the paintings, tying and
securing. From time to time I watched as he made one neat package
after another, thinking to myself, ``What a monotonous job day
after day.''
</P>
<P>
   After a while, we took a coffee break and he asked me if I was a
painter, either oblivious to what he was packing, or just to make
conversation. I admitted I was, and this provoked a thoughtful
silence. Then he said, ``Do you do this every day?'' I said I did
indeed. Another silence. Then in a sympathetic voice he said, ``It
must be boring.''
</P>

<P>
   Matthew C. Garcia stopped in at his local Barnes &AMP; Noble to buy
a volume of poetry by Gerard Manley Hopkins. As the salesclerk rang
up the purchase, she said briskly, ``That comes to $10.66.''
</P>
<P>
   Without thinking, he replied, ``The year of the Norman
invasion,'' and was given a blank stare in return.
</P>
<P>
   Trying to explain himself, he said, ``You know, the year the
Normans invaded England, William the Conqueror and all that.''
</P>
<P>
   Another blank stare. But as Garcia handed over his money, the
young clerk looked up, somewhat awestruck, and said, ``Wow, can you
do that with any number?''
</P>
<P>
   John Schiff was jogging in Central Park, wearing his Nolan Ryan
T-shirt with a picture of the retired pitcher on the front and
facts of his career on the back. As he jogged along, he realized
someone was pacing behind him. After three minutes or so, the man
behind him put on speed and called out as he passed: ``Thanks for
the information. Good reading.''
</P>
<P>
   The New York Grand Opera Company has been giving free Wednesday
evening performances at Central Park's ``Summerstage'' for more
than two decades. Vincent La Selva, the artistic director, answers
the telephone himself in the company's small office.
</P>
<P>
   This year, he began keeping a record of some of the telephone
queries put to him on performance days:
</P>
<P>
   ``What do you people intend to do about the weather?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I would like to go to the free opera in Central Park. How much
does it cost?''

   ``Oh, aren't you nice,'' the woman says, and sits down next to
me.

elderly.'' The woman my age nods her head.

FORT WORTH BIDS FOR RYDER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIMMY BURCH 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH _ In a darkened office at Colonial Country Club, Dick
McHargue closed the hand-tooled leather cover protecting a
half-inch stack of bound documents. He popped a video cassette into
a tape player.
</P>
<P>
   The room filled with the familiar voice of Pat Summerall. But
this time, Summerall wasn't playing straight man to John Madden on
an NFL telecast or hawking hardware supplies. He was extolling the
virtues of Colonial as host for the week-long 2003 Ryder Cup.
</P>
<P>
   Other voices joined in the chorus, from golf legend Byron Nelson
to Gov. George W. Bush to Red Steagall, the official cowboy poet of
Texas.
</P>
<P>
   In the span of 15 minutes and two videotapes, viewers received a
three-dimensional, computer-generated tour of Colonial's proposed
corporate area in Forest Park and the Fort Worth Zoo. They sampled
some of Steagall's work. And they learned of Colonial's innovative
ideas for the competition, from an Olympics-style opening ceremony
to nightly fireworks displays at the conclusion of play.
</P>
<P>
   McHargue, chairman of Colonial's Ryder Cup Committee, chuckled
as he turned off the final videotape, which served as the
centerpiece of the club's May 15 presentation to PGA of America
officials in Palm Beach Gardens, Fla. He reflected on a
conversation with Jim Awtrey, PGA chief executive officer and the
man who will announce the 2003 Ryder Cup site at some point between
the PGA Championship (Aug. 10-16) and the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jim asked us to think out of the box on this one, and we
definitely did that,'' said McHargue, whose committee has spent
$225,000 in quest of the Ryder Cup, including $75,000 for the 3-D
video. ``We hit them with a lot of new ideas. I really believe that
if they come here ... they'll look back at what we did to make
their event bigger and better and make that the standard for future
Ryder Cups in this country. Our event could be the prototype for
the next 100 years.''
</P>
<P>
   If so, future Ryder Cups will be filled with ancillary events
such as parades, fireworks displays and welcoming ceremonies.
Because the PGA of America caps ticket sales for the Ryder Cup at
30,000 daily admissions, club officials sought a way to elicit more
fan involvement.
</P>
<P>
   That led to the idea of two separate-ticket events to raise
money for local charities. One would be a welcoming ceremony at
Alliance Airport, with an aerial show by the Blue Angels or
Thunderbirds preceding the arrival of both teams' charter planes.
The other would be an Olympics-style opening ceremony at TCU's Amon
Carter Stadium, preceded by a parade down University Drive.
</P>
<P>
   McHargue estimated that $1 million in charitable donations would
be ``very realistic'' from the ceremonies, which club officials
expect to attract a combined 100,000 fans. Under terms of the
proposal, the PGA of America could set whatever price it desired on
tickets to the events and would receive the tax benefit of the
charitable contribution.
</P>
<P>
   Both ideas, said McHargue, met with enthusiastic responses from
PGA of America officials, who have never held grand-scale opening
ceremonies in conjunction with past Ryder Cups.
</P>
<P>
   Cramped for corporate space on club property, Colonial officials
received permission to use facilities at Forest Park and the Fort
Worth Zoo to set up more than 100 corporate chalets, as well as a
40,000-square-foot merchandise tent. A 90-bus shuttle system has
been established to transport Ryder Cup spectators to the course
from 23,000 parking spaces in a variety of public lots within four
miles of the course.
</P>
<P>
   Colonial officials used 22 color-coded maps or drawings to
outline their logistical plans for PGA of America officials. To
give their presentation a Western flair, McHargue enlisted Steagall
to write a poem titled ``The Ryder Comes to Texas'' and had Joey
Jemison, a Fort Worth saddle maker, hand-tool leather covers for
each of the 10 proposals they left with PGA officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll promise you, they've never been courted like we've
courted them,'' said McHargue, whose committee has tapped funds
from club coffers and local businesses during a quest that began in
February 1996. ``From the beginning, we knew if we were going to be
seriously considered, we had to go above and beyond what other
people did. We made sure nobody can outproposal us.''
</P>
<P>
   Such aggressive thinking, said Colonial president Clark Martin,
has helped Colonial clear its two biggest hurdles _ concerns about
parking and corporate space _ and move from ``nowhere to a
contender ... with about a 50-50 shot'' of playing host to the 2003
Ryder Cup, based on feedback from industry insiders.
</P>
<P>
   Lanny Wadkins, 1995 Ryder Cup captain, has identified Colonial
and Pinehurst (N.C.) Country Club as the probable front-runners in
the race to land the event.
</P>
<P>
   ``That would be my guess, based on what I'm hearing'' from PGA
officials, Wadkins said. Other clubs bidding to hold the event are
Medinah (Ill.) Country Club; Congressional Country Club in
Bethesda, Md.; Pebble Beach Golf Links in Pebble Beach, Calif., and
Oakland Hills Country Club in Bloomfield Hills, Mich.
</P>
<P>
   Citing policy, PGA of America officials declined to discuss the
merits of sites. They did confirm that Colonial was the first club
to make a detailed, formal presentation in its quest to land the
Ryder Cup and suggested such a step might set the standard for
future suitors.
</P>
<P>
   How much weight Colonial's proposal will carry during site
deliberations is unclear. But there was no denying the presentation
was well-received in May.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was spontaneous applause when we finished,'' Martin
said. ``It kind of surprised us.''
</P>
<P>
   The warm reception convinced Colonial officials that their
$225,000 outlay could prime the pump for a financial bonanza for
Fort Worth-Dallas. Officials from Rochester, N.Y., site of the last
Ryder Cup held in the United States, estimated an economic impact
between $30 million and $50 million from having the 1995 event at
Oak Hill Country Club. Since that time, the Ryder Cup has
mushroomed in popularity.
</P>
<P>
   Fort Worth Mayor Kenneth Barr, who accompanied Colonial
officials to their final presentation in May, said a Ryder Cup at
Colonial would give Fort Worth ``a world visibility that we don't
have.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be a great showcase for Colonial and for golf, which
is very important in Texas,'' Barr said. ``It would be a great
economic generator for us. There's no question, if they get the
event, we will commit whatever resources we need to make it
happen.''
</P>
<P>
   The question, at this stage, is getting it. Only those inside
the PGA of America know the exact pecking order of clubs vying to
hold the event. And they're not sharing that information.
</P>
<P>
   Like PGA officials, Barr said he was taken aback by the
thoroughness and quality of Colonial's proposal, which he termed
``awesome.'' Club officials, he said, played every card in the deck
to sell a Texas-based Ryder Cup to PGA officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we don't get it, I think it would be because of politics
within the organization itself,'' Barr said. ``We've given them
every reason to choose Fort Worth that we possibly could.''
</P>
<P>
   McHargue concurred.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see how they can tell us, `No.' It just makes too much
sense to me,'' McHargue said. ``I've convinced myself that we're
going to get the thing. I don't know what more we could do, quite
frankly.''

WAY CAN'T OPEN HOLES AND RUN THROUGH THEM, TOO 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By BILL PENNINGTON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Although he is the Giants' fullback, Charles Way
was the team's leading rusher last season. This year, the Giants
would like to expand his role, making Way the team's featured back
more often.
</P>
<P>
   There is one problem. Nearly every good running play involves a
fullback blocking ahead of the ball carrier. Way is by far the
team's most dependable blocker, but he cannot block for himself.
</P>
<P>
   That is why one of the principal goals for the Giants in
training camp is finding a reliable backup fullback _ someone they
can trust to pave the way for Way. Competition for the spot is
between Eric Lane, a second-year player, and the rookie free agent
Greg Comella.
</P>
<P>
   It is one of the few jobs on the team that has not been decided.
</P>
<P>
   Choosing between Lane and Comella was not made any easier after
Saturday's intrasquad scrimmage. Both players blocked and ran well,
even though the Giants offense was dominated by the defense.
</P>
<P>
   Comella, a Stanford graduate, seemed particularly at ease as a
receiver, making eight catches for 29 yards. One of those
receptions was a one-handed over-the-shoulder catch at top speed
along the sideline. Comella also rushed for 18 yards on three
carries.
</P>
<P>
   Lane had 11 rushing attempts for 24 yards and one reception that
lost yardage.
</P>
<P>
   Both showed promise with their blocking ability.
</P>
<P>
   Lane, signed by the Giants as a free agent last year after a
four-year career at Tennessee, was the backup to Way last season.
But the Giants coaching staff was hesitant to use the
6-foot-2-inch, 240-pound Lane in front of Way.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the Giants are determined to find a backup fullback
they have confidence in.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we are aware that getting the ball to Charles is
important for us this year,'' Lane said. ``I have been working on
sustaining and finishing my blocks.''
</P>
<P>
   Giants coach Jim Fassel has not yet indicated that either player
has an edge in the competition for the job, though he appears to be
leaning toward Comella, whom Fassel never fails to praise for his
football instincts. After Saturday's scrimmage, Fassel had good
things to say about both players.
</P>
<P>
   Of Comella, Fassel said: ``He's a good multipurpose back. He can
run, block, catch, and he's smart.''
</P>
<P>
   Comella, who is 6-1 and 240 pounds, expected to be drafted, and
heard from nine National Football League teams when he was not. He
chose to sign with the Giants because he was assured there was
going to be a competition for the backup job.
</P>
<P>
   Lane and Comella each said there was no friction between them,
despite their competition and even though one of the two will
almost certainly be cut from the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a first-class kid,'' Lane said. ``I wish him the best.
And I'll be all right no matter what.''
</P>
<P>
   Comella said: ``You don't wish anyone ill will. It's not me
trying to beat him out or him trying to beat me out. We're both
just trying to do the best we can.''
</P>
<P>
   The issue will most likely be settled by performances in the
Giants' four preseason games. As Lane said Saturday, ``There's a
long way to go yet.''

   Circumstances of cycle shop shooting conflict between cops,
witnesses
</P>
<P>
   By Bill Rankin
</P>
<P>
   C. 1998 Cox News Service
</P>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ When W.T. Standard and Associates employees heard
gunshots outside their building on the morning of Dec. 7, 1995,
they stepped out of their office to investigate the noise.
</P>
<P>
   Two employees of the automotive company saw a man holding a gun,
running toward them and away from the Moto Cycles shop across the
street. One of the workers ducked into an alley and the other hid
under a car. From there, they watched the gunman collapse on the
pavement and cry out for help, pleading that had been shot.
</P>
<P>
   The two office workers hesitated until Willie Sauls told them he
was an Atlanta police officer. With the help of another Standard
employee, they dragged Sauls inside their building. ``After we had
pulled (him) inside, he reached into his sweatshirt and pulled out
a badge,'' Matt James, a company manager, said in a sworn
affidavit. ``He held it up and said, `I'm a cop.' I did not know
this before the man pulled out his badge.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether Officers Sauls, Waine Pinckney and Ivant Fields wore
their badges in plain view and properly identified themselves that
day remains a central questions in the Moto Cycles shop shooting
that killed Jerry Jackson. But a clearer picture of what happened
that morning is emerging as two lawsuits against the city and the
three officers make their way through federal court.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuits were filed more than a year ago _ one by Jackson's
mother, Brenda Jackson, and another by two friends who were with
him that day, Toddrick Williams and Quentin Wimbish, who was shot
in the leg. Corey Dean, who also accompanied Jackson to the
motorcycle shop, has not sued.
</P>
<P>
   Senior U.S. District Judge Robert Vining ruled against the
officers last week, saying they violated the constitutional rights
of Jackson and his three friends by conducting an illegal stop and
seizure.
</P>
<P>
   A trial set for today has been postponed to allow the city to
appeal. It could take as long as a year before the appeals court
rules.
</P>
<P>
   The events of that day and the ensuing weeks _ the death of one
man and wounding of two, including a police officer; conflicting
accounts of the incident; accusations of some witnesses against
police, involving both the shooting and subsequent investigation _
coalesced in charges and countercharges and criticism of police. A
Fulton County grand jury considered murder charges against the
officers, but declined to indict them. The U.S. Justice Department
investigated civil rights violations but declined to seek charges.
Mayor Bill Campbell revived a dormant Citizen Review Commission,
which has yet to consider the case because of the pending lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   A routine investigation by the Atlanta Police Department's
Office of Professional Standards initially found against Pinckney
and Sauls, saying both improperly used their guns and gave
conflicting statements to investigators, according to documents in
the lawsuits. A draft memo by Maj. S.M. O'Brien, head of OPS,
expressed the same conclusion as Vining did on Monday. ``Based on
the statements of the officers and witnesses, there was not at this
time period reasonable suspicion to make a ... stop and frisk,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   On the day of the shooting, the three officers followed Jackson
and his passengers into the Moto Cycles shop because, the officers
said, they suspected Jackson's car was stolen. Depending on the
version of events, the officers either approached the men with guns
drawn, or quickly drew their guns in response to what they
perceived as a threatening situation.
</P>
<P>
   When OPS issued its final report, it found only that Pinckney
improperly used his firearm during the incident. He was suspended
for five days for violating police procedure.
</P>
<P>
   O'Brien testified that she backed off her original finding
because conflicting statements given by officers and witnesses were
never resolved. She testified that she now believes, ``The officers
had reasonable suspicion to conduct a field investigation'' of
Jackson and his companions.
</P>
<P>
   Setting the scene
</P>
<P>
   Through court motions, the lawyers representing the Jackson
family, Wimbish and Williams accuse the police officers of creating
a volatile situation fraught with danger and then intentionally
killing Jackson, who was unarmed and had committed no crimes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it was the work of inadequately trained and supervised
officers whose actions in this case were reviewed by the department
and then covered up by the highest-ranking people in the
department,'' said Atlanta lawyer Al Pearson, lead attorney for
Brenda Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   The city and the police officers strongly deny improper force
was used or that the rights of Jackson and his friends were
violated.
</P>
<P>
   Pearson, a former University of Georgia law school professor,
works for a law firm with a history of winning multimillion-dollar
verdicts. In 1993, Pearson's firm obtained a $9.8 million
settlement from Gwinnett County for a businessman investigated by
police officers who incorrectly suspected he was involved in
illegal drug activity.
</P>
<P>
   In mountains of documents filed in the lawsuits, police
testimony paints a picture of three officers doing a job.
</P>
<P>
   According to the officers' testimony, shortly after 11 a.m. on
Dec. 7, 1995, Fields, Sauls and Pinckney, all in plainclothes, got
in an unmarked, gray Pontiac 6000 and drove toward an International
House of Pancakes for breakfast. They saw a blue Pontiac 6000
driven by Jackson with passengers Wimbish, Dean and Williams.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson was driving to the Moto Cycles shop to discuss how much
it was going to cost to get a motorcycle repaired, his friends
testified.
</P>
<P>
   According to the officers' testimony, when they got close to
Jackson's car, Jackson and his friends began acting suspiciously.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson's friends said they noticed the gray Pontiac was
following them, although they had no idea that it was an unmarked
police car. ``We were just thinking they were just regular young
fellows probably wanting to race because we had two of the same
type of cars,'' Wimbish said. ``We were thinking they wanted to put
the car to the test or whatever. We wasn't suspecting any drama.''
</P>
<P>
   Pinckney testified that some of the passengers in Jackson's car
made ``darting glances,'' leading the officers to suspect
incorrectly that the car was stolen. Fields, who was driving the
gray Pontiac, drove up to Jackson's car as Jackson turned into the
Moto Cycles parking lot.
</P>
<P>
   Fields said Jackson made an ``abrupt'' turn into the Moto Cycles
shop parking lot, making him think that Jackson and his friends
were trying to elude them. ``The turn that they made was suspicious
to me...not illegal, just odd in my opinion,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Fields turned around and drove back to the parking lot to see
that the blue Pontiac was empty. As the officers checked to see if
the car was stolen, a car crash a block away brought employees and
customers in the Moto Cycles shop outside to take a look.
</P>
<P>
   The police version
</P>
<P>
   Up to this point, the officers and witnesses generally agree
about what happened on the day of the shooting. But versions of
what happend next conflict on almost every key point.
</P>
<P>
   According to the police officers' pretrial testimony and
statements they gave detectives, Sauls walked up to the crowd and
yelled out, ``Police. Let me see your hands.'' After he said this,
Sauls said, one of the men, later identified as Dean, ran into the
shop. And when a couple of the men kept their hands in their
pockets, Sauls said, he ordered them to get on the floor and took
out his gun, pointing it at a 45-degree angle toward the ground.
</P>
<P>
   As he walked up to pat down one of the men on the sidewalk,
Sauls said, he holstered his gun and was then shot. Mechanic Thomas
Stearns, who said he thought the motorcycle shop was being robbed,
fired three rounds at Sauls, who was shot in the stomach and wrist.
</P>
<P>
   Sauls said he then emptied nine rounds from his 9 mm Smith &AMP;
Wesson toward the door of the shop as he retreated across the
street before collapsing. All the while, he said, his police badge
was hanging on a chain outside of his sweatshirt. ``I remember as I
went to pat-search one individual, my badge was near my face,
dangling from the chain as I bent down,'' he told police
investigators.
</P>
<P>
   Pinckney has testified that he was trying to determine if
Jackson's car was stolen when he heard the gunfire. He said he ran
toward the shop and saw the muzzle of a gun sticking out the door
toward Sauls. Pinckney said he then quickly fired two shots at the
muzzle and sought cover by a brick wall.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't remember seeing anybody,'' Pinckney said. ``All I
remember seeing was the muzzle. It all happened so quickly.''
Pinckney also insisted that he heard Sauls identify himself as
``police'' and that his badge was ``outside of my shirt, on a
chain, in plain view.''
</P>
<P>
   Pinckney's bullets ricocheted off the ground and killed Jackson
as he lay in front of the shop, GBI forensic tests concluded.
</P>
<P>
   The civilians' version
</P>
<P>
   While the police officers' pretrial testimony and statements to
investigators are similar in their accounts, Wimbish, Dean,
Williams and Moto Cycles shop employees have described a strikingly
different chain of events that led up to the shooting: Sauls walked
up with his gun already drawn. He did not identify himself as a
policeman and instead issued orders laced with profanity for the
crowd to get back in the shop and get on the ground. Sauls was
accompanied by another armed man who stood behind him in the
doorway, and neither man wore a badge.
</P>
<P>
   Numerous other witnesses to the shooting also say that none of
the officers wore identification. Mona Myer, another W.T. Standard
employee, said her co-workers were surprised to learn that the
injured Sauls was a police officer.
</P>
<P>
   ``They didn't know whether to go out and pull that man in,'' she
said of her co-workers. ``If they knew he was a police officer,
they wouldn't have hesitated to go get him....I am certain he
didn't have a badge on.''
</P>
<P>
   Steve Lewis, part owner of neighboring Clearvue Glass &AMP; Mirror
Co., said that he witnessed Sauls running down the street and
firing at the motorcycle shop. Shortly after the shootout was over,
Lewis has testified, he got a phone call from a friend who was a
Fulton County deputy and who had heard a police officer had been
shot in his neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `I didn't see a policeman. I saw a guy running and
shooting,''' Lewis testified. During a deposition, Lewis was shown
the Atlanta police report of his statement and asked to show where
the investigating officer had written down his statements that he
saw no badge around Sauls' neck.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll be honest,'' Lewis said after reviewing the police
report. ``I don't see it. And I do recall the two or three
questions about identification on the person who did the shooting.
I remember specifically they asked me because that's the first
thing that they _ they wanted me to say one thing, but I knew
exactly what I had seen or hadn't seen and told them very
emphatically that there wasn't any identification visible.''
</P>
<P>
   Compounding the confusion is testimony from three eyewitnesses
who saw segments of the shooting from a fourth-floor loft across
the street. The witnesses, Bill Hallman, Serina Whitener and Jeanna
Shiver, said they saw a man wearing a gray plaid shirt stand over
the prone Jackson, who had raised his hand in an apparent plea for
mercy, and shoot him dead.
</P>
<P>
   But Fields, whose weapon was not fired, was wearing the gray
plaid shirt. Pinckney, who fired the bullets that killed Jackson,
wore a dark blue sweat shirt.
</P>
<P>
   In court motions, Pearson offers an explanation: By the time
Fields stood above Jackson, pointing his gun, Jackson was already
shot by Pinckney. Fields did not fire, but witnesses apparently
heard shots fired by Sauls as he retreated across the street.
</P>
<P>
   Pinckney shot at Jackson ``with the intent to kill,'' Pearson
said in a court motion.
</P>
<P>
   Asked by police investigators about a month after the shooting
if he intended to kill Jackson, Pinckney denied it. ``I would never
do something like that,'' he said. ``God knows, I would not do
something like that.''
</P>
<P>
   After 2 1/2 years, three investigations and more than a year of
discovery in the civil lawsuits, Pinckney's involvement in the
shooting remains one of many unanswered questions: Did the officers
wear badges and identify themselves? Did Sauls order Jackson and
the others to lie on the ground inside the shop or outside it? Why
did witnesses say a man in a gray plaid shirt appeared to shoot
Jackson when Fields did not fire his weapon?
</P>
<P>
   ``Only a trial is going to get the truth out,'' Pearson said.
``And we will be ready for trial.''

   CHATHAM, Mass. _ The last time Lori Urs agreed to marriage, it
was to a death-row inmate about to be executed. Sunday, in the
presence of armed police units, she accepted a wedding proposal
that was arguably more unusual.
</P>
<P>
   More than 30 hours after a former boyfriend stormed her house,
holding her and her 14-year-old daughter hostage at gunpoint, Urs
helped end the standoff by agreeing to one of his demands: that she
marry him immediately.
</P>
<P>
   John Nutter, 33, surrendered about 11 a.m., two hours after Urs
consented to his proposal, police said. He was arrested and charged
with rape, assault, and kidnapping.
</P>
<P>
   Urs's daughter, Jennifer, was taken to Cape Cod Hospital for
evaluation and released at about 5:15 p.m. She and her mother
returned to their home about an hour later accompanied by police.
Mother and daughter said nothing to reporters and stayed only long
enough to collect overnight bags.
</P>
<P>
   Nutter apparently believed that the marriage would take place
after his surrender, and was told a minister had been summoned to
the scene of the standoff to perform the rites.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wanted to be married in the ambulance,'' said State Police
Major John Kelley.
</P>
<P>
   Urs _ who had escaped from Nutter the night before, leaving
Jennifer behind _ helped negotiate the peaceful surrender by phone,
talking with the gunman from approximately 7 to 11 a.m., police
said. She accepted his marriage proposal at 9 a.m., as police were
trying to fill other requests from Nutter.
</P>
<P>
   State Police said they did not know whether Urs, 44, really
wants to marry Nutter.
</P>
<P>
   ``She went along with'' the proposal, Kelley said. ``It wasn't
easy for her. She helped us.''
</P>
<P>
   Urs made headlines worldwide last July when she married Joseph
R. O'Dell, a convicted murderer who later was executed in Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   Urs, then a student at the New England School of Law, had taken
up his cause as a member of an anti-death-penalty group, believing
his innocence could be proved by DNA tests. She later traveled to
Italy and struck up a relationship with Mother Teresa on her
husband's behalf.
</P>
<P>
   Around the same time, Urs apparently befriended Nutter, and
police said he lived in her Chatham home for a time. But the
relationship quickly soured. And in an incident similar to
Sunday's, Nutter kept police at bay for six hours at Urs's home
last September, officials say.
</P>
<P>
   Nutter was given a suspended three-year sentence in the earlier
crime, in part because Urs defended him in court, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   If convicted of the current charges, Nutter will face a
mandatory life sentence.
</P>
<P>
   The weekend standoff began at around 11 p.m. Friday, after
Nutter apparently broke into Urs's home at 118 Cross St., according
to police. There, he encountered her daughter and took her hostage,
police said.
</P>
<P>
   Urs arrived home a short time later and Nutter, waving a
shotgun, kept them hostage overnight, as more than 50 officers
surrounded the gray, two-story home near Chatham's tony tourist
strip.
</P>
<P>
   Police said Nutter raped Urs during the early hours of the
standoff. She then escaped while he slept Friday night, and was
treated at Cape Cod Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   It is the Globe's policy not to name rape victims unless they
agree to be identified. But since the two women allegedly taken
hostage had previously been named in published reports, the Globe
decided to report that Lori Urs is the alleged rape victim to make
it clear that is not her daughter.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, federal, state, and local agents continued to
surround the house, attempting to negotiate with Nutter, who placed
at least one phone call to the newsroom of a local newspaper,
demanding to ``let the world know the real situation.''
</P>
<P>
   In a conversation reprinted in The Cape Cod Times, Nutter
demanded cigarettes and the phone number of Sister Helen Prejean,
the author of ``Dead Man Walking,'' the story of a death-row
inmate.
</P>
<P>
   Nutter also admitted to slapping Urs because ``she deserved
it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``All she does is lie,'' Nutter told the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   At 7 a.m. &UR;  &LR; Sunday, Urs reached Nutter by phone. At about that
time, Nutter tossed the 12-gauge shotgun out a second-story window,
police said.
</P>
<P>
   Urs managed to keep Nutter on the phone for most of the morning,
and though she was upset, ``she was pretty strong,'' Kelley said.
</P>
<P>
   As the standoff dragged on, neighbors were ordered to remain in
their homes, even though police did not believe Nutter posed a
genuine threat to anyone's life.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, several Chatham residents expressed irritation with
Urs, saying she should have been warned by her former boyfriend's
earlier behavior.

HATCH URGES CLINTON TO TELL THE TRUTH
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID L. MARCUS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Congress will move beyond the White House sex
scandal and avoid impeachment hearings if President Clinton
publicly tells the whole story of his relationship with Monica
Lewinsky, the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee said
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it is true that he has lied, he ought to clear it up,''
Senator Orrin Hatch said. ``He ought to set an example, and in the
end I think he'd be more respected for having done so, and I think
he could walk away with his head held high.
</P>
<P>
   Hatch appeared on NBC's ``Meet the Press'' after a week in which
Lewinsky, the former intern, received immunity from prosecution.
She reportedly told prosecutors she will testify that she had a
sexual relationship with the president and surrendered a stained
dress that could be used as evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking on Sunday's morning television shows, politicians and
former advisers urged Clinton to keep his word to ``completely and
truthfully'' testify. Those making the calls ranged from Hatch, a
Republican from Utah, to George Stephanopolous, a former Clinton
confidant.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know anybody at the top of the system ... who really
wants to see the president hurt in this matter,'' Hatch said on
NBC's ``Meet the Press.'' Hatch said Clinton has a ``reasonable
chance of getting through this'' if there are not strong new
allegations of wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has denied having a sexual relationship with Lewinsky
and said he did not ask anyone to lie about a relationship. He is
scheduled to testify to a grand jury on Aug. 17.
</P>
<P>
   As Clinton returned home from a weekend in New York, his senior
advisers at the White House recognized that the growing sentiment
for some sort of conciliatory statement presented new
opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're cognizant of a number of outside voices, both Republican
and Democrat, urging some sort of public statement,'' said one
senior adviser, speaking on condition of anonymity. The adviser
said it was too early to determine Clinton's next move.
</P>
<P>
   After searching its archives, ABC News found video footage of
the president embracing Lewinsky and then patting her on the back
during a public event Oct. 23, 1996. Sam Donaldson, co-host of
ABC's ``This Week,'' pointed out that the scene is not the same as
the often-repeated footage of Lewinsky in a black beret embracing
the president.
</P>
<P>
   On the ABC show, Representative John Conyers Jr. of Michigan,
the top-ranking Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee, said he
would be ``crushed'' if the president lied about his friendship
with Lewinsky. But Conyers said he sees no reason for impeachment
hearings, and suggested that independent counsel Kenneth Starr, not
Clinton, should be investigated for his behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Starr is expected to give the House Judiciary Committee a report
summarizing investigations of Clinton and his top advisers. The
committee will determine whether to file articles of impeachment
with the full House, which would then decide whether to impeach
him. If it does, a Senate trial would decide whether the president
should be removed from office.
</P>
<P>
   On CBS's ``Face the Nation,'' Representative Barney Frank,
Democrat of Newton, who serves on the Judiciary panel, said Starr
``obviously is obsessed with a visceral dislike of Bill Clinton.''
</P>
<P>
   Frank said Americans are far more interested in the economy,
Social Security, campaign finance reform, and other weighty issues
than Clinton's private life. ``The serious subject matter gets
crowded out,'' by the news media, Frank said as he called for an
end to speculation about what Clinton did or did not do behind
closed doors.
</P>
<P>
   Most Americans seem to agree. A poll released by Time magazine
Sunday said that 69 percent of Americans said that if the president
came forward and admitted a relationship with Lewinsky, he should
remain in office.
</P>
<P>
   Stephanopolous and David Gergen, another former White House
adviser, said Clinton should tell Americans the truth about his
relationship with Lewinsky if he has not done so already. They said
that if the two went beyond mere friendship, Americans will forgive
the president. But on the ``Fox News Sunday'' program,
Representative Bob Barr, a Georgia Republican who is one of the
president's most vocal critics, said, ``If you perjure yourself,
you have perjured yourself whether or not you say later, `Oh, I'm
sorry I did it.'''
</P>
<P>
   Hatch said of Representative Henry Hyde, an Illinois Repblican
who heads the House Judiciary Committee, ``He'll be honest. ...
He'll be fair and he'll be compassionate. But he'll also want to
uphold the law.''
</P>
<P>
   Hatch criticized Attorney General Janet Reno for ignoring
recommendations to name an independent counsel to look into
allegations of fund-raising abuses in Clinton's 1996 reelection
campaign. ``She's going to start losing credibility of the American
people, and I think it would probably have to lead to her
resignation,'' Hatch said.

<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ Miguel Aleman Velasco, a wealthy television
executive and son of a former president, appeared to be winning
victory by a broad margin as the Mexican governing party's
candidate in gubernatorial elections in Veracruz, one of three
states with local elections on Sunday, exit polls showed.
</P>
<P>
   President Ernesto Zedillo's party, the Institutional
Revolutionary Party, also seems to have held onto a governorship in
southern Oaxaca, tallying a narrow victory over the leftist Party
of the Democratic Revolution, according to exit polls.
</P>
<P>
   But in Aguascalientes, a small manufacturing state north of
Mexico City, the governing PRI party appeared likely to suffer an
important defeat.
</P>
<P>
   The PRI, whose presidents have led Mexico without interruption
since the party was founded in 1929, has never lost a gubernatorial
election in the three states that voted on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The balloting was part of a series of local elections that began
last month, in which new governors will be chosen in 16 states by
the middle of next year. All the contests are seen as tests of
party strength in advance of presidential balloting in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   An exit poll conducted Sunday by TV Azteca, one of two main
national networks, showed Aleman's winning 43 percent of the votes
in Veracruz, on the Gulf Coast, and his closest challenger, a
university professor from the National Action Party, receiving 25
percent, Sergio Sarmiento, the TV Azteca news director, said in an
interview. Televisa, Mexico's other leading national network, also
gave the victory to Aleman.
</P>
<P>
   The Veracruz balloting drew attention because in terms of raw
electoral weight, it was the most important race on Sunday. The
state is the third most populous in Mexico, with 6.7 million
people.
</P>
<P>
   In Aguascalientes, TV Azteca and Televisa said Felipe Gonzalez,
the National Action candidate, a newcomer to politics who heads a
family grocery business, was receiving at least 50 percent of the
votes. The governing party's candidate, Hector Olivares Ventura, a
former senator and party bureaucrat who is the son of a former PRI
governor, was trailing by more than 10 percent of the votes, both
networks reported.
</P>
<P>
   The exit poll results, if confirmed by official tallies, would
amount to a stinging defeat for the PRI.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The National Action Party, which was founded in 1939 and has
strong Roman Catholic roots, controls six of the 31 state
governorships. But its governor in Chihuahua, which borders Texas,
is a lame duck, because last month the party lost gubernatorial
elections to the governing party.
</P>
<P>
   That loss was humiliating and made Sunday's apparent victory
crucial for the National Action Party. Aguascalientes has a
population of 830,000. But it is the only state left this year or
next in which the party had good chances.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are extremely encouraging results,'' Felipe Calderon,
the party president said in a news conference Sunday night. ``They
show the PAN is not a party in decline.''
</P>
<P>
   In rural Oaxaca, where rebels are making inroads among the
Mixtec Indians and plantation peons, Televisa and TV Azteca said a
senator from the governing party, Jose Murat Casab, would defeat
Sen. Hector Sanchez, a popular former socialist from the Party of
the Democratic Revolution. Televisa said the governing party's
victory margin was 51 to 34 percent. TV Azteca said the results
were closer, 43 to 37.
</P>
<P>
   Opposition leaders complained that the governing party was
pressuring rural voters in Oaxaca, but it was not possible to
confirm the assertions or to learn whether that might affect the
outcome.
</P>
<P>
   The Party of the Democratic Revolution was founded by Cuauhtemoc
Cardenas Solorzano, who won election last year as the first
opposition mayor in Mexico City. The party controls no state
governorships.
</P>
<P>
   Cardenas, son of Lazaro Cardenas del Rio, the president who
nationalized the oil industry in 1938, is widely expected to make
his third run for the presidency, in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Partly for that reason, Aleman's candidacy in Veracruz has
aroused national interest. There is speculation that he, too, could
eventually seek the presidency. That would set up a race that would
include as candidates the sons of two former presidents who
governed with starkly contrasting visions.
</P>
<P>
   Cardenas del Rio was a revolutionary general who championed the
working masses. But the Veracruz candidate's father, Miguel Aleman
Valdes, was the party's first civilian president, a businessman who
administered the postwar economic boom known as the ``Mexican
miracle'' from 1946 to 1952. A recently published history of Mexico
portrayed Aleman's presidency as one of the century's most corrupt.
</P>
<P>
   Aleman, 66, has appeared to unify behind his candidacy leaders
from feuding wings of the governing party, including so-called
dinosaurs like former Interior Minister Fernando Gutierrez Barrios
as well as powerful young executives like Emilio Azcarraga Jean,
the heir to Televisa.

MERCE CUNNINGHAM: LYRICAL YET LARGER MOVEMENTS

<TEXT>
<P>
   BECKET, Mass. _ The curtain rose on a stage full of
already-moving bodies at the start of the evening. Those bodies
were still in motion when the curtain fell on the last dance of the
night, in two programs presented here by the Merce Cunningham Dance
Company on Friday and Saturday in the Ted Shawn Theater at the
Jacob's Pillow Dance Festival.
</P>
<P>
   Pure movement has seemed Cunningham's primary concern over 45
years of making dances for his company. It is a concern reflected
in the programs' earliest choreography, created in 1956, in the new
work on the program and in his latest explorations of computer
dance, the subject of a panel discussion and video installation
that were also part of this dance-packed weekend at Jacob's Pillow.
</P>
<P>
   One can see stories or human relationships in the dances,
certainly, and even in the elegantly drawn figures that work their
way across the video screen in ``Hand Drawn Spaces,'' the
installation created with Paul Kaiser and Shelley Eshkar. That is
part of the pleasure of Cunningham's dances, which tend to welcome
the viewer in and encourage a greater amount of participatory
imaginative play than work by most other choreographers.
</P>
<P>
   There is a hint as to the direction that play might take in the
title of the new work on the programs, ``Pond Way,'' in the hush
and hum of Brian Eno's score and in Suzanne Gallo's luminous white
costumes, in the calm abstraction of Roy Lichtenstein's ``Landscape
With Boat,'' which serves as a backdrop, and in the shifts from
warm to red side lighting, designed by David Covey, which subtly
suggest the passage of a day. ``Pond Way'' is one of Cunningham's
serenely lyrical ``nature'' dances, a work that is lightly dreaming
enough to serve as a program opener.
</P>
<P>
   The overall feel of ``Pond Way'' is of drifts of bodies, moving
at a gradually building pace only to disappear at the end, leaving
a single dancer to leap out of sight like a beautiful
water-skimming insect suddenly taking flight. In between, the
dancers draw close in stage-filling clusters that at first look
elegantly disordered, and in smaller ensembles typical of the
accidental-seeming encounters in Cunningham dance. The shifting
patterns are very like the large and small black circles that form
the suggestion of an image in the white canvas behind the dancers.
</P>
<P>
   Several of those encounters stand out in the flow. Thomas Caley
and Derry Swan, at first apart in spikey elegance, join to form a
thicket of crossing limbs. A duet for Jared Phillips and Jeannie
Steele follows, with Ms. Steele the sensuously oozing, slightly
disjointed near-still center of Phillips' urgent circling. A
sphinxlike Banu Ogan claims the stage for a slow, majestic crossing
through which she remains impervious to delicate male attempts to
impede her progress by touching her leg, her waist and her foot.
And five women emerge as a chorus of antique graces in a slowly
unfolding quintet that merges with the group.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pond Way'' and the programs' excerpt from a work in progress
suggest that Cunningham has become interested in much bigger
movement, like the totally unexpected split jumps and runs late in
``Pond Way.'' That new look is embodied in the stirring urgency,
and warmth, of Phillips' dancing, in Jean Freebury's endearing
wild-pony look and in Maydelle Fason, a fierce flea of a dancer
with long liquid arms. It will be interesting to see ``Pond Way''
on a bigger stage. But the intimacy of this theater allows the
viewer an unparalleled close-up look at the individuals who form
this inspired group of dancers. The cast of ``Pond Way'' was
completed by Lisa Boudreau, Holley Farmer, Matthew Mohr, Glen
Rumsey, Robert Swinston and Cheryl Therrien.
</P>
<P>
   The Cunningham company was far too generous in its programming,
however, making for a long night and dulled focus. It was good to
see excerpts from Cunningham's dark, charged 1964 ``Winterbranch''
on Friday and from the exquisite formalism of the 1956 ``Suite for
Five'' on Saturday, with Caley the epitome of earthy classicism in
the solo. Both pieces were parts of the programs' ``Event,'' which
concluded each night with dance from the work in progress. The
closing tableau of the unfinished piece was quietly stunning. But
by the time one made one's way into ``crwdspcr,'' which ended the
program, it was hard to revel in the surging rush of the
choreography and in the glittering clatter of John King's exciting
score.

FIRST ITALIAN IN 33 YEARS WINS TOUR DE FRANCE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mich., Italy)  (lb) 
 By SAMUEL ABT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ Marco Pantani on Sunday became the first Italian in 33
years to win the Tour de France, but it was a depleted and
demoralized group of riders who crossed the finish line on the
Champs-Elysees.
</P>
<P>
   After dominating his rivals in the Pyrenees and Alps, Pantani's
lead was so secure that he was able to ride the final 91-mile leg
from Melun to Paris in the middle of the pack and withstand a flat
tire late in the leg. But his victory was accompanied by little of
the usual clowning and antics by fellow riders, because of the
ever-present drug scandal that enveloped the three-week race even
before it began in Dublin, Ireland, on July 11.
</P>
<P>
   In a normal year, this Tour would be recalled for some wonderful
racing, including what could become a legendary stage in the rainy
and foggy Alps in which Pantani crushed his main rival, Jan
Ullrich, the defending champion from Germany.
</P>
<P>
   But as Bobby Julich said after becoming the first American since
the three-time winner Greg LeMond to finish in the top three in the
Tour, ``Ten years down the line you may see an asterisk.'' Ullrich
finished second this year, 3 minutes 21 seconds behind. Julich was
4:08 out of first.
</P>
<P>
   Pantani at least will receive a hero's welcome in Italy on
Monday, where he will be acclaimed Campionnissimo _ champion of
champions. The last authentic one was the fabled Fausto Coppi, who
won the Tour de France in 1949 and 1952 and dominated the sport in
the 1940s and early 1950s.
</P>
<P>
   It is a title that is not easily earned, but one that Pantani
claimed by winning the Tour only two months after winning the Tour
of Italy, the world's second-ranked bicycle race to everyone except
the Italians.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a throwback, the old-fashioned kind of rider,'' Italian
Prime Minister Romano Prodi said in a telephone interview Sunday.
Prodi, a devotee of professional racing, meant that Pantani did not
base a season on one major race.
</P>
<P>
   The future of this 95-year-old race remains an open question.
Already there is talk of a boycott next year by foreign teams, with
the Spaniards leading the way. Four Spanish teams and an Italian
team quit the race last week to protest what they regarded as the
violation of human rights by the French police who have been
investigating allegations of the use of illicit
performance-enhancing drugs.
</P>
<P>
   The unprecedented turmoil included the expulsion on July 17 of
the world's top-ranked team, Festina from France, after its coach
said he had supplied his riders with illegal drugs. In all, two
dozen riders, coaches, team doctors and masseurs have been taken in
for judicial questioning, and a quarter of them have been charged.
Five Festina riders have admitted that they practiced doping with
the artificial hormone EPO, or erythropoietin, and the TVM team
from the Netherlands is due in a French court Monday to testify in
a related case.
</P>
<P>
   Besides those two teams, members of two others have been taken
into custody and suspicion has fallen on two more in the Tour's
rolls of 21 teams. A leading rider, Rodolfo Massi, an Italian with
the Casino team from France and the former best climber, has been
arrested, and more Festina riders will be heard in court this week.
</P>
<P>
   The 96 riders remaining of the 198 who started made up the
smallest total since 1983, when 88 finished what 140 began.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Frankie Andreu, a U.S. Postal Service team rider from Dearborn,
Mich., summed up Sunday's atmosphere by recalling a recent
conversation with Patrick Jonker, a Dutchman with Rabobank:
</P>
<P>
   ``He said that when he came onto the Champs-Elysees this year,
he wouldn't have the same kind of tingling sensation of `I finished
the Tour and accomplished something.' It's more like, `We made it
to the Champs-Elysees and now we can get out of here and be done
with the race.'''
</P>
<P>
   Jean-Marie Leblanc, the director of the race, echoed the
sentiment. Asked if he was happy that the race had continued
despite two strikes by riders and a threat by them to go home
before the finish, he said, ``Happy? I'm happy only to reach Paris.
Otherwise I'm not happy.''
</P>
<P>
   Jean-Claude Killy, the 1968 Olympic ski champion who is now
president of the Societe du Tour de France, the organizers, was
confident that the Tour would survive. ``You can't destroy a
myth,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But others were not as resolute.
</P>
<P>
   Graham Jones, a Briton who rode five Tours from 1979 to 1987,
characterized the situation as a crisis, ``the biggest that we've
ever seen in cycling.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A pity, a shame, a crisis for all of us,'' said Eddy Merckx,
the Belgian champion who won the Tour five times and was with the
race this year to watch his son, Axel, finish 10th overall.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Roche, the Irishman who won the race in 1988 and played
a leading role at the start in Dublin, called this ``a very rough
time'' but added hopefully that ``some good has to come out of
it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody admits there's a problem and that cycling has to get
its act together,'' he said. ``That's a good place to begin.''
</P>
<P>
   With such a traumatic backdrop for the race, perhaps it was
fitting that Pantani emerged the winner.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unbelievable what he's gone through, the sacrifices and
pain he has known,'' Prodi said.
</P>
<P>
   Pantani was hit by a car in the minor Milan-Turin race late in
1995, fracturing his legs. He spent the rest of that season and
most of 1966 on crutches, learning to walk again.
</P>
<P>
   Last year he had recovered, but bad luck struck again in the
Tour of Italy in June 1997, when, of all things, a black cat
crossed the road and caused a mass crash that took Pantani down. He
finished third in the Tour, the same placing he had in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   This year the 28-year-old leader of the Mercatone Uno won the
Tour of Italy by dominating his opponents in the mountains and then
riding a superlative time trial to finish third.
</P>
<P>
   Acknowledged to be the sport's swiftest climber, the
5-foot-7-inch, 132-pound Pantani came into this year's Tour de
France with many complaints: The mountains were not difficult
enough, he said, and only two of the five daily stages in the
Pyrenees and Alps ended on a peak, meaning his rivals would have
the chance to catch him on long descents on three of those stages.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, he finished second and first in the Pyrenees and
first and second in the Alps. The final Alpine stage was canceled
when the riders held a protest against the French police for their
handling of the doping investigation.
</P>
<P>
   With a lead nearing six minutes before the final time trial,
Pantani again finished a surprising third, guaranteeing himself
victory when the Tour finished in Paris Sunday. That was margin
enough to subdue panic when he had a flat on one of the first of 10
laps on the Champs-Elysees and had to be rushed back by his
teammates to the main pack.
</P>
<P>
   But Pantani rarely gives in to panic.
</P>
<P>
   Once known as Il Elefantino, the Elephant, because of his large
ears, Pantani has reshaped his image in the last few years. Now he
prefers to be known as Il Pirata, the Pirate, with his ears hidden
under a bandana, his head shaved, an earring in his left ear, and a
mustache and goatee.
</P>
<P>
   It gives him a suave appearance, but Felice Gimondi, the last
Italian to win the Tour de France, said: ``His biggest virtue is
his intelligence. He has an acute sense of the race.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A real star,'' Prodi said.

BASEBALL COLUMN: YANKS' POOR START? THAT'S ANCIENT HISTORY 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By GEORGE VECSEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ In this season of the 50-game margin over .500, one
strange fact is now largely forgotten: The Yankees actually lost
the first three games of the season.
</P>
<P>
   It's just a silly memory now _ at least until the Yankees lose
another three straight _ but there was a full-fledged frenzy in the
news media when the Yankees stumbled through two games in Anaheim
and one in Oakland with an 0-3 record. Murdochian tabloidists were
waving the garish fright mask of The Man From Tampa, becoming
surrogate bully boys for the great man himself.
</P>
<P>
   Managerial rumors were being spread like cold-virus germs. Names
were being bandied about. Davey Johnson and Dick Williams and all
the old chestnuts were being warmed up to replace Joe Torre as
manager. That was this season, Doctor. Four short months ago. A
mere third of a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can remember Michael Kay saying that no team had ever lost
the first four games of the season and won the World Series,''
recalled David Cone, who was pitching Sunday night as the Yanks
tried to improve on their 77-27 record.
</P>
<P>
   Kay, a Yankee radio broadcaster, had indeed come up with that
statistic, which made the Yankees' fourth game, in Oakland, vital,
at least so far as panic-button pushers were concerned.
</P>
<P>
   When the Yankees won that game, the pressure was still not off.
They lost the fifth game of the season. ``We were thoroughly
embarrassed,'' recalled Cone, who was lighted up in the Kingdome
the night the Yankees fell to 1-4. ``We had to find a way to stop
the bleeding.''
</P>
<P>
   This bunch of professionals held a clubhouse meeting and
promptly won 76 of their next 99 games. It is still true that the
team that has won the most games in one season, the 1906 Chicago
Cubs, promptly lost the World Series to the White Sox in six games
after their 116-36 regular season.
</P>
<P>
   So the Yankees have that dismal precedent to combat in October,
to say nothing of the specter of Randy Johnson, who, judging from
the way he struck out 12 in his winning debut with Houston on
Sunday, will inevitably pitch against the Yankees twice in the
World Series.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees have faced panic before. George Steinbrenner went
into his Bluster act after the Yankees lost on opening day, with
only 161 games in which to recuperate. Somebody reached the man by
telephone to ask his reaction, which is tantamount to rapping on
the glass at the lion house in the zoo. Thus provoked, the Boss had
to be the Boss, opening up his jaws and emitting the predictable
growl about how the players would not ``have to sit around and read
about how good they're going to be.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``We're behind Tampa Bay right now. That's one way to
look at it.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it's hard to look at it from that perspective after
the Yankees went 50 games over .500 on Saturday, and discovered
they like it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's our job to maintain an even keel,'' Cone said before
Sunday night's game. ``We have suffered tremendous losses in the
playoffs. This team has great perspective. We've had some big
losses in this place. We are very proud of this team, but we have
more to accomplish.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a great attitude, and a lot of it comes from Torre, who
seemed so calm in April when people were dusting off the fact that
the last time the Yankees lost three games to start a season was in
1985, and that Yogi Berra was soon dumped with a 6-10 record after
a meager 16 games.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I start worrying about that,'' Torre said in April, ``I'll
manage scared and distracted, and I can't do that. If we lose
three, four or five games, I'm not going to change what I do and
how I feel. That's not to say I don't feel bad about the losses.
They drive me nuts. But whatever the fallout of this is, that's
what it is.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Torre admitted Sunday evening that the poor start had concerned
him. The Yankees had not worked out much in the previous week
because of rain along the West Coast, and they were looking sloppy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew we were better than that,'' Torre said, ``so we just
held a meeting and I pointed out that we had to play harder.''
</P>
<P>
   Torre remembers the meeting as calm. Another version is that
Paul O'Neill and a few other players railed at the Yankee pitchers
to protect them better with brushback pitches. In the sixth game,
David Wells lofted a couple of pitches over the head of Junior
Griffey, and when Griffey stared at him, Wells said, ``If he can't
take a joke, the heck with him.'' The tone was set.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he had been more worried than he let on, Torre said:
``We had to believe that everything we had done in two years
wouldn't be erased by a week of bad baseball. You hope, and if it
is, so be it.'' Nothing like that happened. The Yankees are on
target to beat the Cubs' record. Somebody should call up the Boss
and remind him that the Yankees are not trailing Tampa Bay anymore.

MANDY PATINKIN: SINGING OUT IN A QUEST FOR ROOTS
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn.: N.Y.)   (jw) 
 By STEPHEN HOLDEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In America, we like to think of history as flowing in
a straight line, from the 19th century toward the 21st, from the
Old World to the New, from a rustic village on another continent
into the ``happily ever after'' of the great American melting pot.
It isn't that simple, of course. Whether we recognize it or not,
the flow goes in both directions. Wherever we go, we bring the past
with us, even if we don't realize it.
</P>
<P>
   You could describe Mandy Patinkin's inspired one-man show
``Mamaloshen'' (``Mother Tongue''), an evening of Yiddish songs
interspersed with American popular standards, as an intimate
dialogue between the Old and New Worlds, between Jewish tradition
and Jewish assimilation. The show, at a former synagogue on New
York's Lower East Side, is a theatrical elaboration of an album of
Yiddish songs Patinkin released early this year on Nonesuch
Records. The album and the show are part of an emotionally
supercharged restoration project by the 45-year-old American Jewish
singer and actor in which he seeks to recapture and honor a
tradition that many don't realize is a direct forerunner of
Broadway musical comedy.
</P>
<P>
   The thread Patinkin uses to connect a dozen or so Yiddish songs
is Paul Simon's austere 1973 ballad ``American Tune,'' a morose
folk-pop hymn that when it first appeared was read by many as a
sad-hearted lament for the decline of American idealism in the age
of Watergate. Here, Patinkin recognizes it as a song about the
immigrant experience, breaking it into fragments that become
chapter headings in a program that includes a playful children's
alphabet song, ``Oyfn Pripetshik,'' and a searing Holocaust song,
``Unter Dayne Vayse Shtern.''
</P>
<P>
   As deconstructed by Patinkin, ``American Tune'' becomes a
surreal reflection in which he travels through time and has a
series of visionary flashes that suggest the images and colors of a
Chagall painting.
</P>
<P>
   Other familiar standards woven into the program and sung
sometimes in English, sometimes in Yiddish, sometimes in both,
include Irving Berlin's ``God Bless America'' (performed while a
giant American flag unfurls at the back of the stage) and ``White
Christmas'' (delightfully re-interpreted as a dizzy skipping
instrumental duet by Eric Stern on piano and Saeka Matsuyama on
violin), and Leonard Bernstein and Stephen Sondheim's ``Maria''
(``Mayn Mirl''), from ``West Side Story.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Take Me Out to the Ball Game,'' composed in 1908 by Jack
Norworth and Albert Von Tilzer, is offered as a proto-melting pot
celebration in which America is a great big happy American family
munching peanuts and Cracker Jacks at a baseball game. In the
hourlong show's corniest moment, Patinkin coaxes the audience into
standing up and dancing the hokeypokey.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout, the singer, dressed in black, brings his
characteristic ferocity to the material, turning it into a
sustained drama of his spiritual and esthetic quest for roots. Some
of the Yiddish songs, like ``Motl der Opreyter,'' the story of a
tailor working in a sweatshop who is killed in a union strike, are
wrenching. Patinkin dramatizes everything in a sharply etched
vocabulary of hand gestures that range from the explanatory to the
fist-shaking. His voice can dip from a reedy, brittle falsetto
filled with a childlike wonder and longing, into a deep feral
growl.
</P>
<P>
   There are no emotional halfways. You feel the agony, anxiety and
joy that fueled Jewish immigration from Eastern Europe to America.
Just as powerfully, the show conveys an abiding nostalgia for the
language and culture left behind.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mamaloshen'' runs through Aug. 22 at the Angel Orensanz
Foundation and Center for the Arts, at 172 Norfolk St., on the
Lower East Side.

THIRSTY NEW JERSEY RESORT FINDS USE FOR SALTY WATER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla., N.C., N.Y., S.C., Va.) (js) 
 By ROBERT HANLEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAPE MAY, N.J. _ For decades, vacationers have flocked to this
resort's broad beach on the Atlantic, its big hotels and its quaint
pastel Victorian guest homes, bringing a welcome infusion of cash.
</P>
<P>
   But the visitors have had a devastating effect on Cape May's
underground water supply, depleting it to the point that, since
1950, two community wells have been abandoned after they became
contaminated by salty ocean water that seeped in to replace the
fresh water, and the use of two others has been curtailed.
</P>
<P>
   With the salt threatening the town's fifth and last well, Cape
May is installing the first desalination plant in the Northeast,
becoming the northernmost of dozens of resorts and cities on the
East Coast that have turned to desalting to offset strains on their
water supplies. All are purifying brackish ground water that was
once useless.
</P>
<P>
   The move toward desalination began in the late 1970s in highly
developed resorts on Florida's gulf coast like Sarasota, Fort Myers
and Cape Coral, said James Birkette, a consultant on desalination
from Maine. Boca Raton and Hollywood on Florida's Atlantic coast
also rely on the plants. Recently, desalination moved northward to
Mount Pleasant, S.C.; Cape Hatteras and Nags Head on North
Carolina's Outer Banks; Newport News and Chesapeake in coastal
Virginia, and now, to New Jersey's southern tip.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a natural result of population growth and overstress on
aquifers,'' Birkette said of coastal cities' growing reliance on
desalting plants.
</P>
<P>
   The common denominators for the resorts, he said, are the steady
arrival of new residents and tourists and the overpumping of
aquifers. By allowing the resorts to use once-undrinkable salty
water, the plants ease the strain on aquifers and help slow the
incursion of salt water. When fresh water is removed in large
quantities, rainwater and streams cannot replenish the aquifers
quickly enough, and salt water then seeps in.
</P>
<P>
   In Cape May, summer tourism swells the population to nearly
40,000 from about 4,500 and pushes daily water demand on busy
weekends to about 2.7 million gallons from about 900,000 gallons,
said Thomas Phelan, a former mayor and now head of Cape May's
desalination committee.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last 50 years, salt water has been spreading through
Cape May's well field at an increasing speed. In the 1950s, the
salt front crept northward at a rate of about 92 feet a year.
</P>
<P>
   By the late 1980s, the incursion had sped up to about 271 feet a
year, according to a study conducted by the U.S. Geological Survey
in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Federal geologists have estimated that the salt front would
reach Cape May's only unaffected well, No. 5, by 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had to take 1998 as the year it was going to hit, to be on
the safe side,'' Phelan said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The salt front encroaching on Cape May is not New Jersey's
first. Two others in the last 20 years have ruined hundreds of
wells in communities along Raritan Bay and on the Delaware River
south of Camden.
</P>
<P>
   Saltwater intrusion is also a problem, though a much less severe
one, on Long Island, which gets all of its drinking water from
aquifers. In Nassau County, water officials said, salty water has
doomed two wells in Great Neck, which like Cape May is on a
peninsula, and forced that community to drill new wells farther
inland.
</P>
<P>
   Cape May's $5 million desalination plant has allowed it to drive
its first well into the deepest of five aquifers, which are stacked
in layers beneath the Cape May Peninsula, and to begin treating the
previously unused brackish water.
</P>
<P>
   The new plant is to begin test runs early this month, and
officials hope to have it operating by Labor Day. It is designed to
treat 1 million gallons a day and can be expanded to treat 2
million gallons.
</P>
<P>
   Federal and state loans and grants paid the plant's $5 million
in construction costs. The plant will add $1.25 per 1,000 gallons
to the resort's summertime water-sewage charge of $14.53 per 1,000
gallons. Phelan of the desalination committee said he expected his
family's water bill to increase about $85 a year.
</P>
<P>
   But the big hotels use from 1 million to 8.5 million gallons of
water a year, city officials said. The new plant will add anywhere
from $1,250 to $10,625 to their annual water bills, they said.
</P>
<P>
   Residents and innkeepers seem more resigned to the rate increase
than angry about it. After all, they have wrestled for years with
the need for water conservation and threats the salt front poses
for tourism, the backbone of Cape May's economy.

SEX SHOPS' LAWYER CHALLENGES INSPECTIONS
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn.: N.Y.)   (jw) 
 By DAVID M. HALBFINGER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The city's crackdown on the sex industry will face a
last-ditch court challenge Monday by a lawyer for six Manhattan
strip clubs and adult video stores who says he can prove they have
complied with the city's new restrictions and should not be shut
down.
</P>
<P>
   A Supreme Court hearing set for Monday afternoon could decide
the fate of Show World, the labyrinthine 1970s-era sex emporium at
42nd Street and Eighth Avenue, as well as other similar businesses.
The hearing comes two days after three strip clubs elsewhere in the
city were raided by the police and padlocked by building
inspectors.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, on Friday, a Queens judge ordered three other strip
clubs to stop allowing nudity or also be closed.
</P>
<P>
   The raids and court orders were described as the first wave in a
series of closings aimed at eliminating most of the 144 such
businesses in New York.
</P>
<P>
   But Herald Price Fahringer, lawyer for Show World and five other
Manhattan sex shops, said Sunday that he could show that his
clients had adapted to the city's new rules _ in particular, one
that defines a sex shop as a store that devotes more than 40
percent or more of its business to pornographic material.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Show World has added hundreds of old, G-rated
videotapes to its basement offerings, placing ``Snow White and the
Seven Dwarfs'' and ``Beauty and the Beast'' a few steps from a rack
filled with rubber sex toys.
</P>
<P>
   It has also installed pool tables, at $2 a game, although none
of them were in use during a visit late Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   And at the two Harmony Theaters _ one at 279 Church St., the
other at 161 W. 22nd St. _ the dancers have taken to wearing tops
and bottoms, Fahringer said.
</P>
<P>
   As for the three strip clubs that were padlocked on Saturday _
El Coche, in Hunts Point, the Bronx; Wiggles, in East Flatbush,
Brooklyn, and Sharks Go-Go, in Midland Beach on Staten Island _
city officials said their owners were entitled to court hearings no
later than Tuesday, in which they may ask for a chance to defend
their businesses at full civil trials.
</P>
<P>
   ``They could challenge our proof at trial, or they may walk
away,'' said Steven Fishner, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's criminal
justice coordinator. ``Their cases could also be settled.
Ultimately, we want these locations to be reopened as lawful
businesses.''

U.S. TENNIS ROOTS NEED WATERING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The drive from home to the Los Angeles Tennis
Center winds around a public golf course and past four public
tennis courts. On Sunday afternoon there were kids swatting at golf
balls on the driving range. But the courts sat baking in the sun,
deserted save for a couple of in-line skaters.
</P>
<P>
   It would be simple to look at the hale spectator turnout for
Andre Agassi's straight-set victory over Tim Henman in the final of
the Mercedes-Benz Cup and surmise that there's nothing wrong with
tennis in the United States that a deep, first-rate field couldn't
fix.
</P>
<P>
   But far away from the decorated athletes and the designer
clothes and cars, the fuzz is off the tennis ball. The United
States Tennis Association, slow to recognize the drying out of the
sport at the grass-roots level, is now going to great lengths to
shower the neglected area with attention.
</P>
<P>
   Last year USTA president Harry Marmion appointed a committee to
explore ways to improve the junior-developmental program.
</P>
<P>
   Pumping millions of dollars into it is a start, but it'll end up
being so much overrun without the proper caretaking. For years, you
see, the USTA has been like the home owner who meticulously
maintains his front yard to keep up appearances while allowing his
back yard to get choked by weeds.
</P>
<P>
   As far back as 1987, a monthly tennis publication was running
stories on ways to resurrect American tennis. The U.S. continues to
lag behind Europe in the cultivation and care of tennis talent
because funding for junior programs was not appreciably greater in
1997 than it was 10 years earlier.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, deep pockets have tended to be more of a precursor
for net success in the U.S. than solid ground strokes.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, tennis remains very much a high-end sport. After all,
it wasn't the Saturn Cup that concluded Sunday. And those were
Tommy Hilfiger shirts the volunteers were wearing, not Hanes.
</P>
<P>
   The challenge for the USTA, said the 11th-ranked Agassi, ``is to
get kids with the most ability as opposed to kids with the most
money.''
</P>
<P>
   Money matters less in the European countries. There the most
promising young players, particularly the boys, are routinely
funneled into tennis camps, where they receive top-notch training
and coaching _ along with an education _ in a highly controlled,
ultra-competitive setting.
</P>
<P>
   There are private tennis academies in the U.S. that provide the
same environment _ Nick Bollettieri's camp in Florida, which Agassi
once attended, is perhaps the most renowned of the lot. But the
costs of attending one effectively exclude all but the well-heeled
or the well-grounded whose superior skills afford them a free pass.
</P>
<P>
   The USTA, instead of embracing the private academies, has often
viewed them as an adversary. That needs to change, as does the
patently American affection for tiptoeing around children's psyches
for fear of disturbing them.
</P>
<P>
   In Europe, the top young players have a wealth of tournaments in
which to hone their games, more than four dozen a year. That's not
the case in the U.S., where the number of International Tennis
Federation events have been restricted to fewer than a dozen by
administrators concerned over the possible psychological
ramifications of exposing young kids to too much cutthroat
competition.
</P>
<P>
   Even when a young player's psyche is willing, the cost of
tournaments can be prohibitive, what with the entry fees and travel
expenses. Former UCLA standout Justin Gimelstob is among the
current crop of up-and-coming kids to have benefited from the
USTA's growing largess. Twenty-one-year-old Jan-Michael Gambill,
No.65 with a bullet, is another.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the time I was 12, the USTA has helped support me with
coaching, with everything,'' said Gimelstob, 21, who upset
top-seeded Patrick Rafter in the quarterfinals here on Friday
before losing to Agassi in the semis. ``It has been a huge support
for me.''
</P>
<P>
   The ascension of sisters Venus and Serena Williams, who learned
the game on the courts of Compton, could democratize tennis the way
Tiger Woods did golf. But they remain at least a Grand Slam title
away from transforming their sport. In the meantime, Agassi wishes
more tennis players could be culled from the inner cities.
</P>
<P>
   The problem, of course, as described by Agassi, is, ``it's much
easier to find a rim somewhere and get one basketball than it is to
find rackets, balls and another player.''
</P>
<P>
   Tennis in this country has undergone more rebirths than Agassi,
so perhaps all is not lost. There are some foreign-born players who
question whether or not it even has been misplaced. Listening to
Henman, a Brit, you're reminded that one country's definition of a
crisis is another's idea of a craze.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think you've had your fair share of great players,'' Henman
said testily. ``When you can just name off the top of your head
(Pete) Sampras, (Jim) Courier, Agassi and (Michael) Chang, you
shouldn't be complaining.''

SUBORDINATION BEATS WESTERN FOES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DEL MAR _ Subordination took advantage of the favorite's
starting-gate injury to dominate Sunday's Eddie Read Handicap,
which became the third major Southern California race in a little
more than a month to be won by a beast from the East.
</P>
<P>
   That trend is notable, because for decades trainers believed
shipping horses from East to West was inherently more difficult
than going from West to East.
</P>
<P>
   Now, it's fair to ask if that was a myth, if that was a crafty
excuse for eastern horses' defeats, or if New York and Kentucky
simply have all the best horses these days.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's still a big disadvantage,'' said Gary Sciacca,
the Belmont Park-based trainer of Subordination, who led from gate
to wire under jockey David Flores to win by a length. ``Unless
you've got a great horse.''
</P>
<P>
   Kentucky-based Escena won the Vanity Handicap at Hollywood Park
in June. New York-based Skip Away won the Hollywood Gold Cup in
July. And now New York-based Subordination has won the $300,000
Eddie Read, pushing his earnings over $1 million in one of the
major turf races of the summer.
</P>
<P>
   It's the second successful cross-country trip for the 4-year-old
colt, who won the Hollywood Derby in November. Since then, he won
races on both turf and dirt in Florida and New York.
</P>
<P>
   The Eddie Read became an easier mark when the hyperactive
Labeeb, 8-5 on the tote board, was ordered scratched by the track
veterinarian after thrashing around, hitting his head on the
starting gate and sustaining a friction burn on a hind leg. Labeeb
was reported in good shape back at Neil Drysdale's barn Sunday
evening.
</P>
<P>
   The new favorite was another Drysdale-trained horse, Hawksley
Hill. But the weekend turned out to be a complete bust for
Drysdale, whose Fiji ran third at 2-5 odds in the Ramona Handicap
won by See You Soon on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Hawksley Hill ran last most of the way before rallying late to
take third in a three-way photo between Bonapartiste and Magellan.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Flores put Subordination on a comfortable lead from
the outside post position and they held it for 1[ miles. Sciacca, a
38-year-old New York native, said he replaced regular rider Eibar
Coa because Flores would be more familiar with the Del Mar turf
course.
</P>
<P>
   With that hometown assist, Subordination became the first
eastern horse to ship in to win the Eddie Read in the 25-year
history of the race.
</P>
<P>
   Notes: Escena and jockey Jerry Bailey were 1-5 in the Go for
Wand Handicap at Saratoga on Sunday but lost a stretch-long duel to
Aldiza and Mike Smith. The top-ranked mare had won four in a row.
She carried 11 pounds more than her upsetter.... Del Mar is
guaranteeing the pick-six pool will be at least $2 million on Aug.
15, the day of the Pacific Classic. It's an amplification of the
gimmick introduced with much success at Hollywood Park, where
guarantees of $1 million and $1.5 million produced pick-six pools
of $3.3 million and $3.8 million.... Touch Gold, who arrived here
Saturday to run in the Pacific Classic, went 1{ miles Sunday in his
first gallop over the track.

SMASHING PUMPKINS: OVERWHELMING EMOTIONS ON A MUSICAL SEESAW 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By JON PARELES   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Smart rockers have distrusted bombast for at least
two decades, since punk-rock blasted away the excesses of 1970s
rock. But Billy Corgan, the songwriter, singer and lead guitarist
for the Smashing Pumpkins, is out to rehabilitate the possibility
of grandeur in rock. His songs imply that overwhelming emotions _
love, shame, loneliness, rage _ deserve outsize music: stately
marches and tolling guitar chords, processional introductions and
stomping hard-rock jams.
</P>
<P>
   Corgan is unabashedly attached to the theatrical possibilities
built into rock dynamics, harking back to the sound (though not the
staging) of early 1970s David Bowie. At Radio City Music Hall on
Saturday night, the Smashing Pumpkins seesawed between majesty and
bloat.
</P>
<P>
   Corgan himself is a decidedly unimposing presence, perhaps the
geekiest rocker ever to become a pop idol. His voice is nasal and
scratchy, the sound of a nerd who wanders from dreamy musings to
tantrums. Onstage, with spotlights illuminating the dome of his
shaven head, he looked awkward whenever he wasn't letting loose
screaming guitar solos.
</P>
<P>
   His lyrics, however, portray a turbulent, introspective
character who can lose himself in love or see through all his own
weaknesses. Such a sensitive soul has found a devoted audience
among teen-age girls, who stood through the entire concert and
squealed ``I love you, Billy!'' in every quiet spot.
</P>
<P>
   The band's set, which lasted more than two hours, drew on its
most recent albums, the current ``Adore'' (Virgin), which ponders
love, and the 1995 ``Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness''
(Virgin). Ballads opened into surging crescendos; rockers like
``Ava Adore'' reached for elemental impact.
</P>
<P>
   Moving at a deliberate pace below pealing, high guitar leads,
some songs became the sonic cathedrals that art-rock once tried to
build. Yet while Kenny Aronoff, one of rock's finest drummers, is
touring with the band, even he couldn't budge the inertia of some
ballads. And ``Tear,'' with pseudo-classical piano interludes by
Mike Garson (who performed on Bowie's ``Aladdin Sane''), revealed
exactly what was tiresome about art-rock the first time around.
</P>
<P>
   In the finale, a pulsing, pounding, droning version of Joy
Division's ``Transmission,'' Corgan quoted Bowie's ``Let's Dance''
and added a cracked, left-field rant promising an alien invasion.
Then, one by one, the Pumpkins invited audience members onstage and
handed them their instruments, putting the music in amateur hands.
Perhaps it was their way of showing that for all their bombast,
their hearts are still in punk-rock.

 POPOV DEFEATS U.S. RIVAL, AND IT ISN'T EVEN CLOSE
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST MEADOW, N.Y. _ In the final dual meet of Goodwill Games
swimming, the contest that everyone looked forward to Sunday night
_ the 50-meter freestyle sending Alexander Popov of Russia against
Bill Pilczuk of the United States _ turned out to be a rout.
</P>
<P>
   The near-capacity crowd of 1,229 at the Nassau County Goodwill
Games Swimming and Diving Center watched Popov draw away in the
last 20 meters to a 5-foot victory over his teammate, Roman
Yegorov. Pilczuk, from Cape May, N.J., was 6 inches behind Yegorov,
a disappointment for someone who upset Popov at this distance in
last January's world championships.
</P>
<P>
   That was Popov's only loss in seven years, a slight blemish for
one who had swept the Olympic sprints in 1992 and 1996. Popov said
he lost because he made mistakes. Here, he made no mistakes against
Pilczuk.
</P>
<P>
   Popov made light of the rivalry.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always swim fast for myself,'' he said. ``It doesn't matter
who the competition is.''
</P>
<P>
   Pilczuk agreed: ``There's really no rivalry. We're good
friends.''
</P>
<P>
   The United States led Russia, 59-56, going into the final race,
the 4x100-meter freestyle relay. But Russia, helped by Popov's
second leg in 48.50 seconds, won the relay by seven meters in 3
minutes 18.18 seconds and won the meet, 63-59.
</P>
<P>
   The United States, whose women were undefeated, lost all three
men's meets. The men's champions were the unbeaten World All-Stars,
who defeated Germany, 85-37.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier on Sunday, Goodwill officials addressed a sticky
situation by awarding $10,000 to Penny Heyns, a 23-year-old Olympic
champion from South Africa. On Saturday night, on the first lap of
the women's 100-meter breast-stroke, Heyns set the first world
record for the 50-meter breast-stroke.
</P>
<P>
   The International Swimming Federation, known by its French
acronym of FINA, said in January that it would recognize such
50-meter records if they bettered existing world bests. Heyns swam
50 meters from a buzzer start to electronic touch-pad finish in
30.95 seconds. The best previous time was 31.58 seconds in 1988 by
Silke Horner of East Germany.
</P>
<P>
   Goodwill literature distributed to officials and competitors
listed a $50,000 bonus for a world record here. Heyns expected that
bonus, but when meet officials said after her race that she was
ineligible for a bonus because the 50-meter breast-stroke was not
on the program, she was more puzzled than angry.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I know,'' she said then, ``is that there was no fine
print. It said, `World record: $50,000.' And the name of the meet
is Goodwill.''
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, Mike Plant, the Goodwill Games president, met with
his officials. They decided to give Heyns $10,000. ``It was a
superlative performance by an outstanding athlete that couldn't be
ignored by being outside the list of events,'' said Michael
Lewellen, a games spokesman.

WITH NETBALL, WEST INDIAN IMMIGRANTS TRANSFORM A PARK 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla., Calif., N.J., Texas)  (js)

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Just a few years ago, Lincoln Terrace Park, a green
expanse in Brooklyn, was overrun with weeds, prostitutes and drug
dealers.
</P>
<P>
   But these days, the 18-acre park is crowded on summer weekends
as thousands of people flock there to watch their favorite players
pass, shoot and score.
</P>
<P>
   They are not gathering to watch basketball, though, or even
soccer. The lure is netball, a game similar to basketball that is
played almost exclusively by women. The sport is unknown to most
New Yorkers, but it is extremely popular in the West Indies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Netball brings people together,'' said Patricia Gray,
president of the U.S. Netball Association, which was formed about
six years ago. ``These are folks who want to keep their culture
strong.''
</P>
<P>
   The emergence of netball is another small sign of the wave of
diversity _ propelled by the arrival of more than 1 million
immigrants in the last two decades _ that has transformed the
city's landscape, even down to the games New Yorkers play.
Immigrant soccer leagues thrive throughout the city, Korean
volleyball teams play in Queens, and Pakistani cricketers compete
in Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent Sunday, several thousand people gathered at Lincoln
Terrace Park to watch a dozen games that were part of a 36-team
summerlong netball tournament sponsored by the Caribbean American
Netball Association. The teams, with names like Hairoun, the
Sharecroppers, the Tornadoes and Foreign Base, have players from
Trinidad, Jamaica, St. Vincent, Guyana and other Caribbean
countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're re-creating our life from the islands,'' said Jerry
Rogers, who moved to Crown Heights 10 years ago from his native
Trinidad. ``We love America, so we're giving it part of us.''
</P>
<P>
   And netball has transformed Lincoln Terrace Park, said Gailene
Windsor of Brooklyn, a spokeswoman for the Caribbean American
Netball Association. ``Netball sure did come to the rescue of that
park,'' she said. ``It's a place to go meet people you haven't seen
in months.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Windsor said there are 46 netball teams and more than 1,000
players in the United States. The game has a dedicated following
not just in Brooklyn, but also in West Indian enclaves in the
Bronx, where another league thrives, and in New Jersey, California,
Florida and Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Although netball is unfamiliar to most Americans, the sport
began in the United States in 1895 as a women's version of
basketball, coaches and longtime players said. Netball caught on in
Britain and eventually gravitated to British colonies around the
world, where it has enjoyed lasting popularity.
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The transformation of the Lincoln Terrace Park into a netball
haven began about four years ago, when players approached the city
about using the park for a tournament. City parks officials, eager
to attract more people to Lincoln Terrace, seized the opportunity,
building four asphalt courts.
</P>
<P>
   ``The worst kind of park is a deserted park,'' said Parks
Commissioner Henry Stern. ``It had been taken over by undesirable
elements. We're delighted to see our parks being used.''
</P>
<P>
   Many residents of the area agree _ even those, like Leroy Davis,
who are not netball enthusiasts. Davis said that he used to stay
clear of the park.
</P>
<P>
   ``Man, let me tell you, you didn't want to go there,'' said
Davis, 56, who was pushing a stroller with his 8-month-old
granddaughter, Kisha, tucked comfortably inside. ``Now it's cool,
you can walk around and there are people. It's a lot safer.''
</P>
<P>
   As for netball, Davis said: ``That's what this is? I had no idea
what they were doing.''

METS BEAT DODGERS
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Now, the Dodgers are hoping Hideo Nomo is the pitcher
they remember.
</P>
<P>
   They don't want to see the one with fresh memories of Nomomania
or the no-hitter or all those strikeouts, but the struggling
right-hander whom they traded in June to the New York Mets.
</P>
<P>
   Tonight, they want to see on the mound at Shea Stadium a pitcher
who can still bounce a few forkballs and help !ital!them!off!
salvage a split of a four-game weekend series after a dreadful 9-3
loss Sunday in front of 33,843.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guy did a lot for this organization,'' said general
manager Tom Lasorda, once Nomo's manager. ``But now he is standing
in the way of where we need to go.''
</P>
<P>
   With any luck the Mets should be sending Nomo to the mound to
complete a sweep, but the Dodgers won the series opener Friday on a
couple of ninth-inning blunders by New York. Saturday, the Dodgers
gave that one back with a messy ninth of their own.
</P>
<P>
   Less than 24 hours later, the Mets moved 2{ games ahead of the
Dodgers in the wild-card chase. The Chicago Cubs lead San Francisco
by 2{.
</P>
<P>
   Tonight, Nomo will face Dave Mlicki, one of the pitchers the
Dodgers got in the June 4 deal with New York.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, the Dodgers listened as the boos got louder for their
old catcher Mike Piazza, who finally managed an infield hit after
going hitless in his first 10 plate appearances in the series. But
the visitors had their own problems. Errors by third baseman Adrian
Beltre and center fielder Raul Mondesi in the third inning led to
five unearned runs and buried left-hander Brian Bohanon (4-7).
</P>
<P>
   Mondesi was back in the lineup after missing two games with
lower-back pain, but he should have stayed in bed. The rest of the
offense should have, too. On this trip, the Dodgers are 9 for 46
(.196) with runners in scoring position.
</P>
<P>
   Beltre booted a ground ball by Mets starter Armando Reynoso
(2-0) to start the inning. One batter later, Edgardo Alfonzo lined
to center, but Mondesi lost the ball in a blinding sun and it
caromed off his glove. John Olerud flied to center for what should
have been the final out. Instead, it was a sacrifice fly that
scored Reynoso.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets were just getting warmed up. Piazza, who Mets GM Steve
Phillips said is pressing, grounded to short, but Brian McRae lined
a two-run single to center and Butch Huskey crushed a two-run homer
to left. The Mets, who later lost Huskey with a severe hamstring
pull, added three runs in the eighth, two on a two-out single by
Olerud, who extended his hitting streak to 16 games. The Dodgers
had two runs in the ninth, but after the game they were stinging
about the third inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those conditions are out there for both teams, we can't let
things like that beat us,'' manager Glenn Hoffman said. ``It was
good to have Mondy back, but he needs to make that play.''
</P>
<P>
   Nomo originally was scheduled to pitch Sunday but was bumped to
tonight so Reynoso could get some work. Nomo has adopted a policy
of not speaking to the media the day before a start so he has gone
underground since Friday. But his attempt to come back after a
miserable start with the Dodgers is on the minds of many people,
especially since he has won his last three starts for New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it will be much bigger when he comes to L.A. for the
first time as a Met,'' said former teammate Eric Karros.
</P>
<P>
   Dave Wallace, the former Dodgers pitching coach and now a
special assistant to Phillips with the Mets, said many disregarded
the severity of Nomo's offseason surgery that removed bone chips
from his right elbow.
</P>
<P>
   ``No matter how mild the surgery was, it was still an
operation,'' Wallace said. ``Players need to time to recover and I
think that was a big part of Nomo's problem. There is no question
he struggled with the Dodgers and it has been a slow process. But
we are starting to see good signs.''
</P>
<P>
   One of most frustrating parts of former manager Bill Russell's
tenure with the club was the relationship with Nomo, who wanted to
pitch deep into games even without his best stuff. When Nomo
continued to pitch poorly, scouts pointed to his years in Japanese
baseball when it was not uncommon to throw more than 200 pitches in
a game. Mets manager Bobby Valentine, who managed in Japan for a
year, said pitchers there are no longer taxing themselves that way.
</P>
<P>
   ``They actually learned that from us, the idea that more is
better,'' Valentine said. ``But there have been times when I've
gone to the mound to take the ball from Nomo and he has given it up
willingly. Maybe it is part of the learning process.''

A WEEK AT SEA GIVES YOUTHS AN APPRECIATION OF SAILING 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ As the HMS Rose sailed down the East River on Friday,
Jake Herczeg, 15, of Brooklyn, sang and worked on the deck of the
three-masted frigate. Seven other teen-agers added their voices to
``Barney'' and ``Sesame Street'' songs as the young sailors tarred
the giant anchor of the sailing ship to keep it from rusting.
</P>
<P>
   Below, Katonyah Yehudah, 17, of Manhattan, crouched on her hands
and knees and scrubbed the galley floors with steel wool. She was
smiling. ``If my mom saw me now she'd be real amazed, because I'm
really lazy at home,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The teen-agers _ 20 in all, from New York City neighborhoods as
well as suburban towns _ were about to complete a weeklong sail
from Boston to New York as part of a $75,000 program organized and
sponsored by the National Maritime Historical Society, a nonprofit
organization in Peekskill, N.Y. The program, called Sail of Two
Cities, was intended to give young people an appreciation of
sailing and the sea _ and of themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Felicita Santiago, an adult volunteer on the ship, was not
surprised that the teen-agers were thriving despite little sleep,
hard work and the lack of such '90s necessities as video games,
televisions and telephones.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I've discovered is that we in education try to teach
students using the team approach,'' said Ms. Santiago, who is
principal of Public School 75 in Brooklyn. ``But it's fake. It's
not real, because you have to work around a lot of variables. If
you really want kids to come together, especially kids at risk,
then you have to give them something task-oriented that creates
discipline, like this sail. I call it sailing for the soul.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Santiago is also a trustee of Floating the Apple, a
nonprofit program that teaches boat building and rowing and is
designed to give New Yorkers, especially young people, affordable
access to the water. Many of the teen-agers aboard the Rose, a
28-year-old replica of a 1757 British frigate, came to Sail of Two
Cities after training with Floating the Apple, which is based in
Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   ``The program was a free exchange to let these kids begin
breaking out of old patterns and recognize new ones,'' said Michael
Davis, a founding trustee of Floating the Apple. ``When you've done
things you couldn't do, and people respect you not for your makeup
or your jewelry but who you are, that's great.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Whether it was climbing to the top of the rigging to help furl
the main topgallant, or sail, so that the frigate could clear the
Brooklyn Bridge; taking the helm; learning to tie knots; learning
navigation, or cleaning the head, all the teen-agers had the chance
to test their physical endurance and challenge their
responsibility. They said they would always remember the lessons
they learned aboard the Rose, which ended her sail at the South
Street Seaport in Manhattan on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I rate this better than the first time I drove a car,'' said
Alex Taveras, 16, of Manhattan. ``I've always been a friendly guy,
but I learned you need teamwork to run this boat and probably other
stuff in your life because you can't always do it on your own.''
</P>
<P>
   LaToya Edwards, 16, of Brooklyn, said the hardest time on the
boat was when the seas got rough off Cape Cod and a lot of her
shipmates became seasick. ``Some of us had to work harder than
others who couldn't do the work because they were so sick,'' she
said. ``And some still tried to work despite being seasick.
Overcoming that experience together felt good.''
</P>
<P>
   When they docked, none of the teen-agers wanted to leave the
friends they had made, or the cozy quarters of the ship.
</P>
<P>
   Jason Santiago, 17, of Brooklyn, needed only a few moments to
think about his favorite memories of the journey. ``Having to do
watch at 4 a.m. was the best time for me,'' he said. ``I got to see
the sun rise. I can't see that where I live.''
