<HEADLINE> Iran Accuses U.S. of Harassing Ships in Gulf </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bandar Abbas (Iran), July 3 (Xinhua) -- An Iranian Foreign
Ministry official on Saturday accused the United States of
harassing Iranian and foreign ships in the Persian Gulf.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. is still creating problems for navigation in the
Persian Gulf under the pretext checking food dispatches to
Iraq, Mohammad Hussein Forouqi, an official in charge of legal
affairs, said at a press conference.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on the sidelines of a ceremony to mark the 11th
anniversary of the downing of an Iranian passenger plane by
a U.S. warship in the Gulf, Forouqi said that the cases of U.S.
harassment have been reported to the United Nations and Iran
would follow up the matter.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. by no means is allowed to check or inspect vessels in
the Persian Gulf and the U.N. has not permitted it to do so, he
said, stressing that the continued U.S. presence in the Gulf is
creating problems for the regional countries.
</P>
<P>
Iran has repeatedly warned that the U.S. military presence
in the Gulf region was the real threat to the regional security
and stability. It called for regional cooperation to maintain
security and stability without foreign intervention.
</P>
<P>
An Iranian passenger plane, en route from Bandar Abbas, the
capital of Iran's southern Hormozgan province to Dubai, the
United Arab Emirates, was shot down on July 3 1988 by two
missiles fired by the U.S. warship Vincennes in the Gulf.
</P>
<P>
All the 290 passengers and crew members, including 160 men,
73 women and 57 children, were killed in the incident.
</P>
<P>
At the press conference, Managing Director of the Iranian
flag carrier (Iran Air) Ahmad Reza Kazemi asked the U.S.
to make an official apology to the Iranian nation, government
and families of the victims.

<HEADLINE> Iran Rejects GCC Call over Disputed Islands </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, July 3 (Xinhua) -- Iran on Saturday rejected the
call by foreign ministers of the members states of the Gulf
Cooperation Council (GCC) for efforts to solve the territorial
dispute between Iran and the United Arab Emirates (UAE).
</P>
<P>
Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Hamid Reza Asefi expressed
dissatisfaction with the statement of the GCC foreign ministerial
meeting concluded in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Termed the statement as "partial and unacceptable," Asefi said
that the position adopted by the GCC foreign ministers is against
Iran's territorial integrity, the Islamic Republic News Agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated that the three islands of Abu Musa, the Greater
and Lesser Tunbs belong to Iran and are an integral part of the
country.
</P>
<P>
Iran is prepared to remove the misunderstandings with the
UAE through direct negotiations, he added.
</P>
<P>
Foreign ministers of Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia
and the UAE decided on Saturday to form an ad hoc committee to
help resolve the territorial dispute between the UAE and Iran over
the three islands at the mouth of the strategic Hormoz Strait.
</P>
<P>
The committee, which comprises Oman, Qatar and Saudi Arabia,
will devise a mechanism to discuss the UAE-Iranian dispute over
three Gulf Islands, according to the final statement issued at the
end of the GCC ministerial council meeting held in the Saudi Red
Sea port city of Jeddah.
</P>
<P>
Iran took over the islands in 1971 soon after the British
colonialist forces withdrew from the region. However, both Tehran
and Abu Dhabi claimed full sovereignty over the islands.
</P>
<P>
Iran has repeatedly called for mutual talks to remove
"misunderstanding" between the two countries, but the UAE has
called for international arbitration to solve the dispute.

<HEADLINE> Kouchner Regards Security of All Kosovars as Priority </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, July 3 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Civil Administrator in
Kosovo Bernard Kouchner said on Saturday that the priority of the
U.N. administration in Kosovo will be to guarantee the security of
all Kosovars.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the French daily Le Monde, Kouchner said
that the U.N. will seek a reconciliation between the Albanian and
Serb communities, besides guaranteeing the security of both.
</P>
<P>
"The mandate of the U.N. is to replace hatred and war with
peace, despite historical heaviness," he said.
</P>
<P>
Appointed by U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan as the head of the
U.N. civil mission in Kosovo, the French state secretary of health
will quit his post in Paris and leave for New York next week, before
going to Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Kouchner called on the international community to contribute
financially to the reconstruction of Kosovo, and to provide help
to whoever in Yugoslavia in need, no matter Albanians or Serbs.
</P>
<P>
He rejected the demand by the Albanian guerrilla group the Kosovo
Liberation Army (KLA) that it be the main component of a future
civil police force in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
"We should not recruit the members of KLA. We should recruit
policemen according to objective criteria, including education
qualification and sense of duty," he said.

<HEADLINE> SADC Members Urged to Increase Regional Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, July 3 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Botswana President Festus
Mogae has called for increased trade between Botswana and Zambia.
</P>
<P>
Speaking Saturday in Zambia's Copperbelt Province, when he
opened this year's Zambia International Trade Fair, Mogae said
trade which has been growing steadily between Botswana and Zambia
over the past years should be boosted by an aggressive marketing
of products between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
He told audience which included Zambian President Frederick
Chiluba that the plan by the government of Zambia and Botswana to
build a bridge across the Zambezi River at Kazungula to link the
two countries is one way of increasing trade and traffic movement
between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Mogae said the development of a reliable transport and
communications infrastructure is critical to the promotion of
trade and investment and regional integration especially in the
Southern African Development Community (SADC) region.
</P>
<P>
He told the fair participants that the envisaged SADC free
trade area will establish a large regional market with the view to
generating opportunities for private business to realize economies
of scale, improved productivity and to become competitive in world
markets.
</P>
<P>
Mogae further said vibrant regional market will become a lunch
for industries in the SADC region to penetrate the would market.
</P>
<P>
He therefore called on countries in the SADC region to
implement tight monetary and prudent fiscal policies to achieve
high growth rates and sustainable development.
</P>
<P>
Mogae said measures being taken in the region like the
successful privatization program implemented by the Zambian
government will go a long way toward facilitating private sector
growth.

<P>
DAMASCUS, July 3 (Xinhua) -- Syrian Radio stressed Saturday

and policies Israeli Prime Minister-elect Ehud Barak is to take.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> U.N. Team Visits Destroyed Iraqi Vaccine Plant </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, July 3 (Xinhua) -- A United Nations delegation visited
on Saturday a livestock vaccine plant in Baghdad, Iraq, which was
destroyed by U.N. arms inspectors.
</P>
<P>
The delegation, led by Executive Director of the U.N. Program
for Iraq Benon Sevan, was briefed on the situation of the foot and
mouth disease (FMD) vaccine plant destroyed in 1996 by the
U.N. Special Commission (UNSCOM) in charge of eliminating Iraq's
weapons of mass destruction, the Iraqi News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Sevan said the U.N. would send a technical team later this
month to Iraq to check this plant and its laboratories and
evaluate the possibility of rehabilitating it.
</P>
<P>
Livestock husbandry in Iraq and its neighboring countries are
now suffering heavily from the outbreak of FMD.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi media have reported that some 1.5 million heads of Iraqi
cattle and sheep have died of FMD so far this year.
</P>
<P>
During the 1970s Iraq set up a strategic vaccination project
capable of producing 12 million doses annually for preventing
animal diseases.
</P>
<P>
The project was suspended due to the 1991 Gulf War and most of
its production and diagnosis equipment were destroyed in 1996 by
UNSCOM on the ground that they are of dual use.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, when FMD became rampant, Iraq sent a letter
to the U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan requesting urgent
supplies of FMD vaccines.
</P>
<P>
Iraq also demanded U.N. compensation for the loss of its
citizens caused by the spread of FMD among livestock.

<HEADLINE> Iran Demands U.S. Apology for Downing Passenger </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bandar Abbas (Iran), July 3 (Xinhua) -- Iran on Saturday once
again asked the United States to make an official apology to the
Iranian government and nation for shooting down an Iranian
passenger plane in 1988.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference, Managing Director of the
Iranian flag carrier (Iran Air) Ahmad Reza Kazemi said that so far
the U.S. only expressed regret over the downing of the Iranian
airbus plane over the Gulf before the end of Iran-Iraq war.
</P>
<P>
Although the U.S. has paid the "minimum compensations" to Iran
Air and the families of the victim, "but it is not enough, the
U.S. must make an official apology to the Iranian nation,
government and families of the victims," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian passenger plane, en route from Bandar Abbas, the
capital of Iran's southern Hormozgan province to Dubai, the United
Arab Emirates, was shot down on July 3 1988 by two missiles fired
by the U.S. warship Vincennes in the Persian Gulf.
</P>
<P>
All the 290 passengers and crew members, including 160 men,
73 women and 57 children, were killed in the incident.
</P>
<P>
Kazemi said that the U.S. administration not only failed to
punish those responsible for the crime, but it awarded the
warship's captain.
</P>
<P>
Asked about the impact of the issue on Tehran-Washington ties,
he said that surely the case was a hurdle for the relations
between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Had the U.S. made official apology to Iran, at least it
removed one of the obstacles on the way of Tehran-Washington
ties, he said.
</P>
<P>
Before the press conference, officials from Iran Air, military
forces and representatives of victims' families attended a
ceremony on a vessel at the site of the incident in the Persian
Gulf, showering flowers to commemorate the victims.

<HEADLINE> GCC Urges New Israeli Government to Resume Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, July 3 (Xinhua) -- The Gulf Cooperation Council
(GCC) foreign ministers on Saturday called on Israel's new
government to resume stalled peace talks with Arabs on all tracks.
</P>
<P>
The final communique issued after a brief closed-door meeting
of the foreign ministers in the western Saudi city of Jeddah said
that Israel must return the Arab lands in line with related United
Nations resolutions, the Kuwait News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The statement said Jerusalem must also be the capital of an
independent Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
The GCC top diplomats condemned the recent Israeli air raids
against Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Israel, on June 24 and 25, launched intensive air strikes
against Lebanese civilian targets, killing eight people and
wounding more than 60 others.
</P>
<P>
The statement urged the international community to pressure
Israel into respecting the 1996 April understanding and put an
end to Israeli aggression.
</P>
<P>
The 1996 understanding bans Israel and the anti-Israel Lebanese
resistance forces from launching attacks against or from civilian
targets.
</P>
<P>
The GCC foreign ministers called on Israeli Prime
Minister-elect Ehud Barak to resume "serious negotiations" with
the Arabs and honor the commitments of the former governments.
</P>
<P>
The GCC, a regional political and economic alliance established
in 1981, comprises Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and
the UAE.

<HEADLINE> Belgian Farmers To Protest On Food Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, July 3 (Xinhua) -- Belgian farmers are preparing for
a demonstration here in the capital of Belgium on Sunday to
protest against the government's handling of the crisis over
dioxin-contaminated food.
</P>
<P>
"It is imperative that our politicians take measures to support
this sector, which has been seriously weakened by the exceptional
and sudden dramatic circumstances," organizers of the farmers'
protest said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"Organizers expect between 10,000 and 15,000 demonstrators but
it could be more," Brussels mayor Francois-Xavier de Donnea told
reporters on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Brussels authorities have said all tractors, trucks and
other heavy farm vehicles will be banned from entering the capital
during the march. About 2,700 police would be deployed to ensure
the demonstration went smoothly, the Brussels mayor said.
</P>
<P>
The dioxin-contaminated food crisis is officially estimated to
cost 60 billion Belgian francs (1.54 billion U.S. dollars). The
food crisis started in late May when high level cancer-causing
dioxin was found in home-grown eggs, meat and dairy produce, which
were banned from sales both at home and abroad.
</P>
<P>
The Belgian government has so far allocated 6.3 billion francs
(161 million U.S. dollars) to help farmers and businesses hit by
the food scare, which is believed to be Europe's biggest since the
mad cow crisis.

<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, July 3 (Xinhua) -- Mozambican President Joaquim
Chissano Saturday called on African companies to improve quality
of their goods so that they are in a better position to explore
the market.
</P>
<P>
Opening an international trade fair in the Tanzanian capital
Dar es Salaam, Chissano said high quality products met demands of
consumers and are therefore easily marketable.
</P>
<P>
He also expressed the hope that African countries could enter
the 21st century with products of international standards that
could sell anywhere in the world, which will in turn enhance their
economic strength.
</P>
<P>
Chissano, who arrived in Tanzania Friday for a three-day visit,
said trade fairs are important venues for sharing of experience,
and building up and strengthening relationships among countries.
</P>
<P>
Developing countries need to tap their vast potential, the
president said.
</P>
<P>
Chissano commended the Tanzanian first lady, Anna Mkapa, for
her efforts to motivate so many women to participate the fair.
</P>
<P>
Over 370 women exhibitors have participated in the trade fair
with the assistance from the first lady who is a leader of the
Equal Opportunity for All Trust Fund, a women and children
non-governmental organization.
</P>
<P>
The function was also attended by Tanzanian President Benjamin
Mkapa, senior government officials and foreign envoys.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia Says Committed to OAU Framework Agreement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, July 3 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopia as always remains
committed to the Organization of African Unity (OAU) framework
agreement that requires Eritrea to withdraw its troops from all
occupied Ethiopian territories, the Ethiopian foreign ministry
said here on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The ministry said in a statement that Ethiopia had all along
insisted that the OAU framework agreement proposed to peacefully
settle the dispute between the two countries be implemented
immediately.
</P>
<P>
The statement was issued over one week before the forthcoming
35th OAU summit which will be convened in Algiers on July 12,
1999.
</P>
<P>
The statement said that Ethiopia has since the start of the
Ethio- Eritrean conflict worked tirelessly for the peaceful
resolution of the conflict and has accordingly fully supported the
OAU framework agreement from the very beginning.
</P>
<P>
Eritrea, despite its professed acceptance of the framework
agreement, has refused to withdraw its troops from the areas it
occupied since May 6, 1998 and to allow the Ethiopian civil
administration of those areas to be restored fully, the foreign
ministry was quoted by the Ethiopian News Agency as saying.
</P>
<P>
It is in this light that Ethiopia welcomes the on-going efforts
of Libya and other friendly countries to facilitate the full
implementation of the OAU framework agreement and hopes that these
endeavors will bear fruit, the ministry said.
</P>
<P>
The conflict between the two Horn of Africa neighbors broke out
on May 6, 1998 over a disputed stretch of their border. Both
Ethiopia and Eritrea have announced to accept the OAU peaceful
proposal, but they haven't so far reached a cease-fire on their
over one-year border conflict and blamed each other for other
side' s launching new attack. The Ethio-Eritrean crisis will be
discussed at the 35th OAU summit next week in Algerian capital.

<P>
WASHINGTON, July 3 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton has
agreed to meet with Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif on
Sunday to discuss the way for resolving the "dangerous" conflict
with india over long-disputed Kashmir, the White House announced
on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
A White House official said Sharif had requested the meeting
in a telephone conversation with Clinton. And Clinton then
telephoned Indian Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee, who
raised no objections for the meeting.
</P>
<P>
"Prime Minister Sharif requested the meeting given that the
situation in Kashmir is increasingly tense," the official said.
</P>
<P>
And a statement released by the White House press office said
that both leaders agreed "the situation is dangerous and could
escalate if not resolved quickly."
</P>
<P>
The official said Clinton has long been concerned over
developments in the border area and has been conferring with
both sides for several weeks.
</P>
<P>
"We have made our position on the conflict clear," the
official said, adding that Clinton believes that India and
Pakistan should quickly return to direct dialogue.
</P>
<P>
But he said Clinton does not intend to use the meeting with
Sharif as an attempt to mediate the conflict.
</P>
<P>
"We believe this has to be resolved through bilateral
dialogue," he said.

<P>
LONDON, July 4 (Xinhua) -- World tennis queen Steffi Graf of
Germany brought down the curtain on her glorious Wimbledon career
following her final defeat at the hands of Lindsay Davenport on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The seven-times champion made the announcement after losing 6-4,
7-5 to the American on Centre Court but refused to reveal whether
she was retiring from the game.
</P>
<P>
"I will not be coming back to Wimbledon as a player," the 30-
year-old Graf said. "I'm not talking about whether I will play on
at the moment.
</P>
<P>
"I decided before the match, the result would not have made any
difference."
</P>
<P>
Graf, who won her first Wimbledon title at the All England Club
in 1988, added: "Nothing was going to change my mind.
</P>
<P>
"Right now I feel a little bit sad about everything but I still
feel like a winner going out of this tournament.
</P>
<P>
"It has been a lot of fun but there has to be a certain time
when you move on in your life," she added.
</P>
<P>
After winning the French Open last month for the sixth time,
Graf retired from the Roland Garros tournament. Before the
Wimbledon final, Graf once hinted that it would be "tempting" to
come back to Wimbledon next year if she manages to capture her
eighth title.

<HEADLINE> China Restructures Nuclear Industrial System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ratified by the State Council, the CNIG is an extremely large
state-owned enterprise formed on the basis of some enterprises and
units of the original China National Nuclear Corp (CNNC).
</P>
<P>
Directly under the control of the central government, the CNIG
will operate nuclear power stations, nuclear heat-supply reactors,
scientific research reactors, radiation devices and other nuclear
facilities, and will also develop scientific research in fields
related to the nuclear industry.
</P>
<P>
Since China introduced its opening and reform policies 20 years
ago, the country's nuclear industrial administrative system has
experienced two major restructurings: the establishment of the
CNNC to replace the Ministry of Nuclear Industry in 1988 and the
winding up of the Ministry of Energy in 1993.
</P>
<P>
The newly established CNIG is an economic entity which will
operate independently according to market rules. While
guaranteeing military scientific research and production, the
group will focus on the development of nuclear power and the
nuclear fuel industry, and make efforts to develop nuclear
technological applications.
</P>
<P>
The CNIG will restructure and standardize its member
enterprises in accordance with the Corporate Law and gradually set
up a modern corporate system.

<P>
PALMA, Spain, July 4 (Xinhua) -- The American basketball
players are not in any mood to care about the others as they are
confident of adapting to all styles in the Palma Universiade.
</P>
<P>
"It's a very flexible group, able to carry out very different
game conception," said US basketball team trainer Oliver Purnell.
</P>
<P>
"We have tall men, which allows us to carry out any interior
game of great effectiveness," he said. "and we also have fast men,
that facilitates us the counterback."
</P>
<P>
Purnell, who has 21 years to his credit as coach in the campus
level, declined to cite out any purticular player as "there are 10
players, all of them very good. Joining the abilities of all them,
the result is an excellent team."
</P>
<P>
As the most honored team in different Universiades, the
American players do not demonstrate any concern for their rivals.
</P>
<P>
"I don't know what level the other groups have," Purnell said,"
but I have references of Canada, Spain and Mexico because some
Mexican players play in the United States."
</P>
<P>
However, the American trainer still relunctant to promise an
easy victory as "we also trust that some teams will emerge and
perhaps give the surprise."
</P>
<P>
Citing the differences of the sports between American and
Europe, Purnell said that "it is true that the concept of
university sports is different, but every time there are better
university teams in Europe."

<HEADLINE> Higher Yields And Better Quality of Summer Crops </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 4 (Xinhua) -- The current summer harvest in China
has produced higher yields and a better quality of grain thanks to
a new government agricultural policy which was introduced last
year in a bid to improve productivity and output.
</P>
<P>
Since last Autumn, although many areas have suffered from
drought, the country's grain production has remained stable,
according to officials.
</P>
<P>
Official figures show that so far in 1999 the summer crops,
mainly wheat, covered about 31 million hectares, over 800,000
hectares less than 1998, but the unit yields have increased and
the entire output may also be higher.
</P>
<P>
The officials attribute it to the expanded acreage of croplands
that are using good quality seeds, now totaling more than two
million hectares; more investment in water-effective irrigation
projects and farm technology, amounting to 25 billion yuan (three
billion US dollars) in the past three years; and greater
popularity of farm machines such as the 80,000 combine harvesters
which were used this summer.

<HEADLINE> Technological Gap Between India, Developed Countries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, July 4 (Xinhua) -- Technological gap between India
and developed countries was widening due to many factors,
according to a joint study published on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Administrative Staff College of India (ASCI) in Hyderabad,
1,500 kms south of here, and Union Finance Secretary Vijay Kelkar
said in their study that the gap was reflected by India's poor
investments in research and development, lack of penetration into
high technology areas, weak linkages between research institutions
and the industry and poor performance in patenting.
</P>
<P>
The report appraised the technology development in India
vis-a-vis emerging global scenario, the Press Trust of India (PTI)
reported from Hyderabad where the report was published.
</P>
<P>
With its share in the world trade falling below 0.5 percent,
India would find it difficult to cope with global competition in
the face of stricter intellectual property rights regimes unless
major initiatives were taken to enhance critical technology
capabilities and to strengthen national innovation systems, the
study warned.
</P>
<P>
Head of the Strategic Management of Technology Division in
ASCI, B. Bowonder, proposed that a new national policy of
innovation be focus on commercialization of critical technologies,
collaborative research and development, patenting innovation,
designing new products and necessary linkages for exploiting
innovations in the market.
</P>
<P>
"In the changing global competitive landscape, there is a
world-wide trend to aggressively pursue export markets of high
technology products while India's share in this critical sector
had been very low and no initiative has been taken to reverse this
trend except in software segment," Bowonder told the PTI.

<HEADLINE> Pace-setting Shenhua Slaps Wanda at China League </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 4 (Xinhua) -- Reigning league champions Dalian
Wanda kept reeling in the first division of Chinese soccer league
as they were humiliated by leaders Shanghai Shenhua 1-3 at home
court on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Wanda, who snatched their first win of the season with a 3-1
victory over Guangzhou Songri on June 24, has slumped back to the
familiar losing form as they fell to their 10th unwinning match in
a 1-2 loss to Beijing Guo'an last round.
</P>
<P>
Wan Tao, the most prolific scorer in the past five seasons,
finally found the net for the first time in the sixth season but
could not yet salvage his team from the second home-court loss
since the league was inniated six years ago.
</P>
<P>
Wanda maintained its home perfect record until this season's
opening match when they fell 0-1 to Liaoning Fushun.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai went ahead in the 15th minute before Wang Tao
converted a penalty to level the scoring on 29 mintues.
</P>
<P>
Shenhua pulled away in the 61st minute and completed the
scoring through substitute Xie Hui in injury time.
</P>
<P>
Newly-appointed coach Li Yingfa said after the match that the
lack of depth has brought the high-flying Wanda, four-time winners
of in the past five years, to land.
</P>
<P>
"The lack of depth is highlighted in the defence which is too
young to stand the test of the serie A."
</P>
<P>
But the coach remained optimistic about the prospect of Wanda
who are struggling on the brink of demotion.
</P>
<P>
"What Wanda lost is just a match against Shenhua, not the whole
season. We should keep up our confidence to do well in the next
half season."
</P>
<P>
"Now we are placed at the bottom, we need more wins. Only when
we fought our way out of the relegation zone could we set our
sight on further aims."
</P>
<P>
The 1995 league champions Shanghai Shenhua, who became the
newest pace-setters for the first time this season by beating
Guangzhou Songri 2-1 on home turf last round, kept their lead with
a 6-7-0 unbeaten record.
</P>
<P>
Sichuan Quanxin was held to a scoreless tie by Shenzhen Ping'an
and elbowed out the top three by Luneng Taishan who scored an away
win over the lowly Wuhang Heart K 1-0.
</P>
<P>
Chongqing Longxin remained on the heels of the Shenhua with a
two-point margin as the visiting outfit slammed Shengyang Haishi 2-
1 for 23 points.
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere Jilin Aodong lost to Qingdao Hainiu 1-2 at home and
Liaoning Fushun was held to a 1-1 tie by visiting Beijing Guo'an.
Guangzhou Songri collected a home 2-0 victory over Tianjin Taida.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Establishes Chemical Industry Park </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, July 4 (Xinhua) -- China's leading industrial and
commercial city of Shanghai has started to build a chemical
industry park open to both domestic and overseas investors, as
part of the city's efforts to foster new and high-tech industries.
</P>
<P>
The Shanghai Chemical Industry Park, located in Jinshan
District in the southern part of the city, covers an area of 22 sq
km.
</P>
<P>
The park, scheduled for completion by 2016, will concentrate on
the manufacture of various high-tech petrochemical products that
are marketable, capable of saving resources and are environmental
friendly.
</P>
<P>
So far, about a dozen multinationals, including Germany's BASF
and Japan's NPU, have already signed agreements to set up
subsidiaries in the park.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai first decided to give priority to new and high-tech
industries in 1995. By the end of last year, such industries
reported nearly 100 billion yuan (12 billion US dollars) in output
value, accounting for 16.5 percent of the city's overall
industrial output the same year.
</P>
<P>
The city has targeted its high-tech industry output value at
120 billion yuan this year, up 25 percent from last year. The
growth is double the rate for this year's expected industrial
growth.

<HEADLINE> Davenport Beats Graf in Wimbledon Women's Final </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 4 (Xinhua) -- American Lindsay Davenport won her
first Wimbledon title as she powered past Steffi Graf of Germany 6-
4, 7-5 at the women's final on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The 23-year-old American, who returns to the world number one
spot tomorrow after advancing into the final of the championship,
showed no signs of nerves in her first appearance in a Wimbledon
singles final, which was suspended by rain for about 30 minutes.
</P>
<P>
The US Open champion broke Graf's serve in the opening game of
the match as she sent a backhand return down the line and then
managed to hold her own serve in the next game with powerful
serving and dominance at the net.
</P>
<P>
Davenport disputed two decisions by the umpire but nevertheless
managed to maintain her composure and dominated Graf by hemming
her in on the baseline with the length and direction of her
powerful baseline shots.
</P>
<P>
She secured the set on her second set point when French Open
champion Graf, who had just hit a forehand winner, netted a low
backhand.
</P>
<P>
In the second set, after Graf led at 5-4 and Davenport served
the 20th game 30-15, unexpected rain came and stopped the match
for half an hour.
</P>
<P>
After the play was resumed, Davenport, third seed in the
tournament, continued her form and took the game, levelling the
set 5-5.
</P>
<P>
The next game swung the match crucially Davenport's way.
</P>
<P>
The German took a 30-0 lead but a series of errors on the
backhand and forehand saw her held to deuce twice before a Graf
forehand into the net earned Davenport only her second break point
of the match.
</P>
<P>
A superb forehand into the corner left Graf grasping at air and
Davenport was 6-5 ahead.
</P>
<P>
Two aces took her to her first match point, which she wasted
with tame backhand into the net as the pressure of the moment
seemed to get to her.
</P>
<P>
But Graf netted yet another forehand to hand Davenport her
first Wimbledon title. The American turned away and put her hand
to her mouth in her moment of triumph, before the tears started to
flow.
</P>
<P>
"It sounds almost like a dream. I'm in shock, I can't believe I
did it," said Davenport, who has regained the world number one
spot with her Wimbledon success.
</P>
<P>
"What an amazing thing - I'll take the Wimbledon champion any
day over the world number one ranking. I won't forget this - it's
the most beautiful trophy I've ever seen."
</P>
<P>
"I served well and that was the main thing. I only had two
break points and it was pretty amazing that I converted them both.
I played concentrated and calm and I can't believe I did it," she
said. "But it is beautiful that I take it."
</P>
<P>
It was Davenport's second Grand Slam title against 22 for Graf.
Americans Pete Sampras and Andre Agassi contest the men's final
later on Sunday.

<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, July 4 (Xinhua) -- Australian Prime Minister John
Howard said on Sunday that he will discuss economic issues with
leaders of Japan and the United States during his visit to the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
Howard is leaving for Tokyo on Monday to begin his two-week
visit to Japan and the United States.
</P>
<P>
In a news briefing for foreign reporters, Howard made it clear
that he would be pressing his Japanese counterpart Keizo Obuchi on
the need for trade reform.
</P>
<P>
He will also press Obuchi on the need for Japan to press ahead
with financial reforms as its economy struggles to overcome the
Asian financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
On Australia's trade with the United States, Howard admitted
that he was still pessimistic about the U.S. moves to impose
tariffs on Australia's lamb exports to the United States.
</P>
<P>
A final decision by the Clinton administration on the issue is
a month overdue now.
</P>
<P>
"I think it indicates they're thinking hard about what we've
put to them, but we're only interested in outcomes," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said he would be warning President Bill Clinton and
congressional leaders that any move to unfairly restrict
Australia's lamb trade would set back attempts to further open up
trade in agriculture.
</P>
<P>
During his U.S. trip, Howard will also meet with business and
finance chiefs such as U.S. Federal Reserve chairman Alan
Greenspan, World Bank president James Wolfensohn and chief of the
International Monetary Fund Michael Camdessus.

<TEXT>
<P>
ZHENGZHOU, July 4 (Xinhua) -- Work on the Xiaolangdi Water
Control Project along the Yellow River has been speeded up in a
bid to prevent the expected flooding this summer which officials
believe could be even worse than last year's devastating torrents.
</P>
<P>
Part of the project involves the construction of a dam which
has already reached a height of 220 meters, 20 meters higher than
scheduled. Planners say the reservoir behind it can contain 2.75
billion cubic meters of water.
</P>
<P>
Further control mechanisms such as flood diversion channels and
tunnels have also been completed ahead of schedule.
</P>
<P>
"We are working around clock to build the dam higher and more
solid so as to prevent even worse than expected flooding," said a
project official at the dam site.
</P>
<P>
Designed to mainly stem flooding on the Yellow River, China's
second longest waterway, the Project will cost around a total of
40 billion yuan (4.8 billion US dollars) and is second only in
size to the Three Gorges Project along the Yangtze River.
</P>
<P>
Construction started in September 1991 and is due to be
completed in the year 2001.

<HEADLINE> Iran Blasts Western Countries for Interference </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, July 4 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Majlis (parliament) Speaker
Ali Akbar Nateq Nouri Sunday castigated the stance adopted by
western countries towards the arrest of 13 Iranian Jews on
espionage charges.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the Majlis opening session, Nouri termed the stance
of the western countries as "a blatant interference and meddling"
in Iran's internal affairs, the Islamic Republic News Agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian speaker made the remarks in a response to the
recent stance taken by some American congressmen and 143 French
lawmakers in support of the arrested Iranian Jews.
</P>
<P>
He said that the same people and governments, which remained
indifference to the downing of Iranian passenger plane by the
U.S. warship in 1988, have now made a big fuss in the world over
the arrest of 13 Iranian Jews under the pretext of defense for
human rights.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. warship Vincennes shot down the Iranian airbus plane
with two missiles on July 3, 1988, killing all the 290 passengers
and crew aboard. Iran Saturday demanded an official apology from
the U.S. over the issue.
</P>
<P>
Nouri said that no one is being prosecuted in Iran for
advocating certain belief or religion, and today different
minorities are living together with their Muslim brothers and
sisters and are entitled to all citizenship rights.
</P>
<P>
There are people who are arrested in Iran on charges of
smuggling drugs, robbery or links with aliens and their cases are
investigated, he said. The arrest of the 13 Jews is also in the
same line and their charges will be also investigated, he added.
</P>
<P>
Nouri stressed that Iran's foreign policy is based on mutual
respect, observance of the rights of the people and preservation
of national interests.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that the European statesmen who are
interested in having relations with the Islamic Republic of Iran
respect the mentioned principles.

<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, July 4 (Xinhua) -- Some 300 Yugoslav veterans, who
participated in the 1941-1945 anti-facist war, celebrated the
Soldier's Day on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
These old men and women, mostly in their sixties and seventies
and some even in their eighties, exchanged warm greetings with one
another and discussed about what had happened to their country
since the war against the Nazi Germans.
</P>
<P>
They observed a one-minute silence for those killed in the
recent NATO bombings before starting their annual celebration.
</P>
<P>
Koca Jancic, member of the Yugoslav Anti-Facist War Old
Soldiers Association (SVBNOR), said at the annual gathering that
Yugoslavia is the best example of small nation opposing much
bigger countries in recent history.
</P>
<P>
"Yugoslavia is a nation that dares to fight with stronger enemy
for its own freedom and dignity," said Jancic, "But the NATO
bombings have caused unprecedented humanitarian catastrophy for
this Balkan nation."
</P>
<P>
A Belgrade medical college student, Tanja Nastasic, said that
the younger generation of Serbians not only fought against NATO
attacks with the same bravery and endurance as their parents and
grandparents, but will also demonstrate better capability in the
post-war reconstruction of the country.
</P>
<P>
The Yugoslav people decided through a special meeting on July 4,
1941, to rise against Nazi occupation of the country. This day
has since been observed as the country's Soldier's day.

MOSCOW, July 4 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin and
his Ukrainian counterpart, Leonid Kuchma, on Sunday discussed a

in energy and agriculture and on the issue of the Black Sea Fleet.
</P>
<P>
In their informal summit in Yeltsin's Rus country house

<HEADLINE> Indian Troops Recapture Tiger Hills In Kashmir </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, July 4 (Xinhua) -- After three days of fierce
fighting, Indian troops Sunday recaptured the strategic Tiger
Hills, a strategic 4,877-metre high peak overlooking the vital
Sringagar-Leh national highway in the Indian side of the line of
control (LOC) in Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
The recapture was announced by the Defense Minister George
Fernandes in Amritsar, 447 km northwest of here, according to the
Press Trust of India (PTI).
</P>
<P>
Fernandes said that he had been informed by the Army chief V.
P. Malik about the recapture of the Tiger Hills, a key bastion and
supply camp of the so-called intruders in the Kargil region of
Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
On the news of recapture, Indian caretaker Prime Minister Atal
Behari Vajpayee announced Sunday that Indian troops had achieved
"tremendous success" in evicting entrenched Pakistani "intruders"
in Kargil.
</P>
<P>
At a function in the state of Haryana, Vajpayee appealed to the
nation to be united to win the conflict with neighboring Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
His defense minister Fernandes said in Amritsar that the
recapture of the hills paved the way to throw out "intruders" to
the other side of the LOC.
</P>
<P>
"We will now be able to dictate terms to the intruders. Our
army is in a position to do anything," Fernandes reportedly told
the Indian troops.
</P>
<P>
With recapture of the key position, Fernandes said, Indian
would consider any concrete proposal from Pakistan at the
diplomatic level to end the stand-off in Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
However, the minister made it clear that military action in
Kargil would not be effected by talks at the diplomatic level.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated that India respected the LOC and would not like
to violate it. But he added if needed "nobody can prevent us from
doing so."
</P>
<P>
Observers here considered the recapture of the Tiger Hills by
the Indian troops as a major turning point in the on-going
conflict between Indian and Pakistan in Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
For India, the victory would considerably reduce the threat to
its vital Srinagar-Leh strategic national highway, the life-line
for Indian troops in Kashmir.

<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, July 4 (Xinhua) -- A company denies that a deal has
been done which cuts the children out of the opening ceremony,
reports said from Sydney on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Initial plans to have 1,500 foreign students perform at the
opening ceremony were shelved following a public backlash in
Australia. The band members raised their own money to perform at
the Games and threatened legal action when SOCOG backed out of the
deal.
</P>
<P>
SOCOG president Michael Knight said Saturday the agreement had
been reached with World Projects Internationaln, but that
organization, which had a contract to supply American and Japanese
school marching band members for the Sydney Olympics, denied any
deal.
</P>
<P>
WPI president Bill Lutt issued a statement Sunday saying the
company had "an enforceable and binding contract to assemble a
Sydney 2000 Olympic Band to perform at the opening ceremony''.
</P>
<P>
"World Projects is continuing to perform under the contract.
Rehearsals are taking place in Australia, North America and Japan,
" the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Knight said Sunday that SOCOG had put what it believed was a
good offer on the table and it was now up to WPI to deliver.

PALMA, Spain, July 4 (Xinhua) -- Juan Antonio Samaranche said
that the falicities in Palma are of first class to ensure the
success of the 20th University Games, which opened on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The President of the International Olympic Committee attended
the opening ceremony Saturday night, saying the facilities "are of

</P>
<P>
"The restlessness and nerves existed till last minute, but
everything has come out very well," he said.
</P>
<P>
Despite the lack of top-notched athletes as only those aged
between 18 to 28 are eligible for the Universiade, the level of
the Games is still high enough to meet the second biggest
international sport gala, next only to the Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
Samaranch reaffirmed that "the quality is quite important".

<HEADLINE> Vajpayee Refuses Clinton's Invitation For U.S. Visit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, July 4 (Xinhua) -- Indian caretaker Prime Minister
Atal Behari Vajpayee had expressed his inability "at this stage"
to undertake a visit to the United States, a spokesman of the
External Affairs Ministry disclosed here on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton on Saturday invited Vajpayee to
visit Washington "at an early date" for discussions apparently on
the on-going conflict between India and Pakistan in Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that Clinton extended the invitation during
his 10-minute telephone conversation with Vajpayee last night.
</P>
<P>
The Indian leader told Clinton that it would "not be possible
for him to accept this kind of invitation for the present" and
"not convenient at this stage," the spokesman told a daily news
briefing here.
</P>
<P>
He said that the U.S. leader's invitation was "bilateral" in
nature and had "no relation whatsoever to Pakistan Prime Minister
Nawaz Sharif's visit to Washington" which began Sunday.
</P>
<P>
During their conversation, the spokesman said, Clinton informed
Vajpayee about his telephonic conversation with Sharif earlier.
</P>
<P>
A White House spokesman reportedly said in Washington that
"Sharif requested a meeting and I would assume he is bringing some
ideas on how to resolve the current situation."
</P>
<P>
New Delhi has repeatedly said that there is no question of
having talks with Islamabad till Pakistan pulls back its troops
and extremist elements from the Indian side of the LOC, de facto
border between the two neighbors.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether the U.S. president had given indication of any
Pakistani proposal to end the conflict, the spokesman declined to
give any further details of the Clinton-Vajpayee talks.

<P>
TEHRAN, July 4 (Xinhua) -- Iranian First Vice President Hassan
Habibi Sunday started Latin American three-nation tour for talks
with leaders of these countries on the latest international
developments and ways of strengthening bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
Habibi Sunday left for his first leg, Colombian capital
Bogota. During his one-week trip, he will also visit Venezuela and
Cuba, the Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Terming cooperation between Iran and Venezuela, especially
within the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC)
as good, he said that the future issues of the OPEC would top the
agenda of his talks with Venezuelan officials.
</P>
<P>
Habibi also said that expansion of mutual scientific and
cultural relations would be one of other pivotal issues of his
talks in the Latin American tour.
</P>
<P>
Talks between Iranian delegation and officials of these
countries would be effective in expanding mutual ties and
cooperation, he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Iranian Commerce Minister Mohammad Shariatmadari,
who is accompanying Habibi in the tour, said that Iran has made a
comprehensive plan to promote economic relations with Latin
American states.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the potential and existing capabilities for
cooperation with these countries, he said that Iran would discuss
signing of agreements on economic cooperation with the three
countries during his tour.

<HEADLINE> Hebei Reports Slump In Export Volume </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, July 4 (Xinhua) -- The six month foreign trade
turnover in north China's Hebei province dropped 20.1 percent from
the same period last year which is attributed to the lingering
effects of the Asian financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
Latest statistics from provincial customs show that the export
volume dropped 32.3 percent to 570 million US dollars during the
January-June period, with the import volume edging up 0.7 percent
to 550 million US dollars.
</P>
<P>
"The declining foreign trade is an indication of the deepening
impact of the Asian financial crisis," said a provincial trade
official. The province's exports to Asian nations declined about
40 percent during the first half year period on an annual basis.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the province's exports to Asian countries have
shrank from the 68.4 percent at the end of 1998 to 53.6 for the
first six month period this year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, expanding exports to Europe, North America and Latin
American have offset part of the negative impact, as exports to
countries in the three regions surged 54 percent, 32 percent and
21 percent respectively, with exports to them during the first six
months rising to 36.2 percent of the provincial total from the 28.
7 percent at the end of 1998.
</P>
<P>
"The sluggish foreign trade has also forced us to optimize the
product mix of export goods," said the trade official, pointing to
the fact that industrial products, machinery and electronics
products have gradually replaced the primary goods as leaders in
Hebei's export league table.

<HEADLINE> Jordanian Sports Minister Resigns Ahead of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, July 4 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian Minister of Sport and
Youth Mohammad Kheir Mamsar has submitted his resignation one
month ahead of the Pan-Arab Games to be held in Amman, the
semi-official Jordan Times reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Abdul Raouf Rawabdeh announced the minister`s
decision to resign after a cabinet meeting on Saturday, but said
the fate of the minister would be decided by King Abdullah Bin
Hussein, who is abroad on a four-nation tour of Arab countries.
</P>
<P>
Rawabdeh did not give any reasons for the resignation of
Mamsar.
</P>
<P>
Jordan Times quoted an unnamed senior sports official as
saying the government was dissatisfied with Mamsar`s attempt to
"politicize his ministry with regards to the issue of the Kuwaiti
prisoners."
</P>
<P>
Mamsar pledged to Kuwait during his recent visit to the Gulf
emirate to take efforts to get Kuwaiti prisoners, captured during
the 1990 Gulf crisis, released from Iraqi custody.
</P>
<P>
His visit was aimed at persuading Kuwait to drop its threat to
boycott the Pan-Arab games to be held in Amman in August as
Jordan has announced it welcomed Iraq to take part in the
event.
</P>
<P>
However, Kuwaiti officials said last week that their country
would take part in the games if Iraq "releases a single Kuwaiti
prisoner," but Baghdad denied it kept any Kuwaitis in its
prisons, Jordan Times said.
</P>
<P>
The prisoner issue remained sensitive between Iraq and Kuwait,
and Kuwait has made the release of Kuwaiti prisoners one of the
preconditions to improve its ties with Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Mamsar`s decision to touch upon the prisoner issue was blamed
by the Rawabdhe government as "trying to undertake political
missions which are outside his jurisdiction," Jordan Times said.
</P>
<P>
He had planned to travel to Baghdad this month to meet
President Saddam Hussein to mediate for the release of Kuwaiti
prisoners, unconfirmed reports said.
</P>
<P>
Jordan has been trying to strike a delicate diplomatic balance
between Iraq and Kuwait and officials said Jordan welcomed all
Arab countries, including Iraq, to attend the Arab games in Amman.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Ministers Sign Undated Resignation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 4 (Xinhua) -- Only three Nigerian ministers sworn
in last week by President Olusegun Obasanjo were exempted from
signing their letters of resignation, said the Guardian, a leading
Nigerian newspaper Sunday.
</P>
<P>
They are Lt-General Theophilus Danjuma (Defense), Chief Bola
Ige (Power and Steel) and Mohammed Arzika (Communications).
</P>
<P>
As part of the measures put in place by Obasanjo to ensure a
corrupt- free government, he had directed that all ministers
except the three sign undated letters of resignation.
</P>
<P>
Sources close to the president told The Guardian on Sunday that
Obasanjo adopted the measure to ensure that corrupt ministers are
shown the way out of the government immediately. The three
ministers may have been exempted because of the confidence
Obasanjo has in them.
</P>
<P>
It was learnt president Obasanjo is determined to run a
corrupt-free government to ensure that his government succeeds.
</P>
<P>
This, however, is not the first time a civilian government will
compel its ministers to sign their letters of resignation.
</P>
<P>
Alhaji Shehu Shagari, Nigeria's Second Republic President
compelled his ministers to sign their letters of resignation
before they were sworn in 1983 after he had been re-elected.
</P>
<P>
A monitoring team in the presidency to supervise the ministries
and their activities has also been put in place by Obasanjo.
</P>
<P>
The monitoring team is charged with the responsibility of
supervising all the activities in the Presidency to determine the
success or the failure of such ministries.

<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, July 4 (Xinhua) -- Nearly 70 percent of overseas
funded businesses in northern Tianjin Municipality are satisfied
with the improvement in the city's investment climate, according
to a recent survey.
</P>
<P>
Compared to a similar survey in 1997 in which the reaction was
not so glowing, most respondents say they are impressed by
improvements in the elimination of arbitrary fees, government
efficiency, labor quality, free market competition, and power and
water supply.
</P>
<P>
Over 12 percent of the respondents said they are "very
satisfied" with 55 percent expressing moderate satisfaction. Only
4.8 percent responded negatively.
</P>
<P>
And well over 75% percent of the respondents said they would
still choose Tianjin as an investment destination if they were
granted a second chance.
</P>
<P>
The survey was conducted among 540 overseas funded business in
Tianjin, and targeted at their key officials.
</P>
<P>
Tianjin is known to have absorbed the largest amount of
overseas funds of any north China cities. It has approved a total
of 12,000 overseas funded ventures so far, involving contractual
investment of more than 24 billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
On the down side, most respondents are not satisfied with the
traffic conditions, living environment and entertainment
facilities in the city. They have also called for improvements in
legal consulting services and more rational pricing of land and
real estate.

<HEADLINE> Russia Blasts Western Pressure on Air Corridors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, July 4 (Xinhua) -- Russia said Sunday that it was "
stunned" by the refusal of Hungary, Bulgaria and Romania to
provide air corridors to its peacekeepers flying to Kosovo under
pressure from the United States.
</P>
<P>
It said all references to improperly coordinated technical
details of locating Russian paratroopers in Kosovo are absolutely
unfounded, the Interfax news agency reported, quoting sources with
the Russian Defense Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Denial of air corridors by Hungary, Romania and Bulgaria
forced Russia to postpone indefinitely the departure of two
military transport aircraft for Kosovo originally scheduled for
early Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Washington and its NATO allies reportedly want to work out
details of Russia's peacekeeping role in Kosovo before Moscow
sends any new troops to augment its about 400 troops already
stationed in the Yugoslav province.
</P>
<P>
Western media reports said that Russian military negotiators
last week sought to alter an agreement reached earlier in Helsinki
by having their troops in Kosovo report only to Russian officers,
rather than be under the formal command of NATO. Russia also
wants to station forces in the Italian, French, American and
German sectors of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
However, a representative with the Russian Defense Ministry
said, "All details of the location of Russian peacekeepers in
Kosovo were documented during the talks held by the defense and
foreign ministers in Helsinki."
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, these details were updated during the talks held
in Brussels this week by Deputy Head of the Defense Ministry's
Department for International Military Cooperation Valentin
Kuznetsov.
</P>
<P>
Mistrust has been mounting between Moscow and the U.S.-led
NATO following Russia's surprise deployment of 200 troops to
Pristina airport last month and an usual military exercise about
two weeks ago in which American F-15 jets intercepted Russian
fighter-bombers near Iceland.
</P>
<P>
The two Il-76 planes were to have taken off from the Severny
airport near the city of Ivanovo early Sunday. One plane was to
carry two heavy-duty trucks, technological equipment and a
maintenance team. The other was to take over 100 paratroopers and
a group of reporters to cover the peacekeeping mission in the
Balkans, the Itar-Tass news agency reported.

<HEADLINE> Taylor: Foreign Players Destroy Game </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 4 (Xinhua)-- the influx of foreign players into
English clubs was destroying the game, said professional
Footballers' Association chief executive Gordon Taylor on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Though England may win the bid to stage the 2006 World Cup
there might not be a host team good enough to distinguish itself,
the boss was quoted by a report as saying.
</P>
<P>
Taylor also said he was increasingly dismayed with the influx
of foreign players into English football, forcing more out of work
and affecting the chances of all the youngsters trying to break
through.
</P>
<P>
Players' union boss Taylor reckons that the Government's
decision this week to relax work permit rules for players outside
the European Union could even have a detrimental effect on the
international set-up.
</P>
<P>
"We can't deny work permits to those from the European Union,"
admitted Taylor. "But I've been very disappointed this week that
the Government has sought to relax work permit regulations for
players outside of the European Union.
</P>
<P>
"We could now get players who are not better but merely cheaper,
maybe from eastern Europe and Africa where economies are lower."

<HEADLINE> Ferguson Blames Government for FA Cup Withdrawal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 4 (Xinhua) -- Sir Alex Ferguson says government
pressure left Manchester United with no choice but to pull out of
the FA Cup.
</P>
<P>
Instead of defending the trophy the treble-winners will travel
to Brazil for the World Team Championship next January.
</P>
<P>
The Football Association offered United the option of missing
next season's competition.
</P>
<P>
It was feared that snibbing the new FIFA tournament would
damage England's hopes of staging the 2006 World Cup finals.
</P>
<P>
United upset their fans by taking up that offer, but Labour
supporter Sir Alex says Sports Minister Tony Banks left his club
with no choice.
</P>
<P>
"In the last week we have been under considerable pressure from
the government," said the United boss.
</P>
<P>
"It is easy for everyone to criticise Manchester United but if
you read the statement from Sports Minister Tony Banks it said '
Manchester United must go'.
</P>
<P>
"It expressed what they feel. I was so determined for us to
stay in the FA Cup and defend our Treble, but it was clear the
government wanted us to go to Brazil," Ferguson told the News of
the World.
</P>
<P>
"They are on a crusade for the World Cup. If it wasn't for the
World Cup Man Utd would not be involved in Brazil - it's as simple
as that."
</P>
<P>
In separate Sunday newspaper reports, Banks blames threats from
FIFA officials for the situation.
</P>
<P>
"I happen to know, as a member of the World Cup campaign
committee, that if Manchester United hadn't gone to Brazil it
would have destroyed our chances of staging the 2006 World Cup
finals," he told the Mail on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile the Sunday Mirror quotes him as saying: "Three
members of FIFA, who had been very much in favor of our bid said
to my face that if United don't take part they'd change their
minds.
</P>
<P>
"Their argument was that we can't pick and choose, wanting to
host the World Cup but not taking part in one of FIFA's
competitions.
</P>
<P>
"I have the names of those who said it would do damage."

<HEADLINE> Sports Minister: Cup Snub was United Decision </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 4 (Xinhua) -- British Sports minister Tony Banks
has hit back at claims from Sir Alex Ferguson that Manchester
United were pressured by the Government into competing in the
World Club Championships next season.
</P>
<P>
Ferguson has admitted that over the last few days United "have
been under considerable pressure from the Government" who he
believes "are on a crusade for the World Cup."
</P>
<P>
The Old Trafford boss reckons that but for the World Cup - with
a decision to be made on the venue for the 2006 event in March
just two months after the Championships in Brazil - his side would
have gladly defended the FA Cup, and ultimately the Treble.
</P>
<P>
United's participation, following their Champions Cup victory
over Bayern Munich in May, was seen as crucial for England to host
the premier tournament 40 years after they last staged it.
</P>
<P>
If United had declined, then Bayern would have taken up the
offer, handing the initiative to Germany, who along with South
Africa are England's main rivals in the bidding.
</P>
<P>
Banks, however, is adamant that it was United's decision all
along, saying "Exceptional circumstances have caused this
situation to arise.
</P>
<P>
"But this is something Manchester United were happy to do and
the idea that I personally have forced them to do it is a rather
interesting story.
</P>
<P>
"I hope Mr Blair (the Prime Minister) realises just how
powerful I am in domestic and world football."
</P>
<P>
But Ferguson is convinced the ultimate decision was out of
United's hands. He added: "It is easy for everyone to criticise
Manchester United.
</P>
<P>
"But if you read the statement from Sports Minister Tony Banks
it said 'Manchester United must go'. It expressed what they feel.
I was so determined for us to stay in the FA Cup and defend our
Treble but it was clear the Government wanted us to go to Brazil."

<HEADLINE>   Malaysia Beats Nepal 3-2 at Asian Olympic Qualifier </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, July 4 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia ended up third in the Asian
group six qualifying tournament after a second leg 3-2 victory
over Nepal here on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
In the first leg of the qualifier for the Sydney Olympics held
in Hong Kong two weeks ago, Nepalese fans invaded the pitch in the
dying seconds. And the football's world governing body considered
the game a 1-1 tie shortly before the second leg started.
</P>
<P>
Akmal Rizal Rakhili opened the scoring for Malaysia with a
right foot shot in the 23rd minute before Rajan Raymajhi equalized
it six minutes later.
</P>
<P>
But Nepalese fans in the stadium were silenced early in the
second half when Chow Chee Weng made it 2-1 in the 53rd minute and
Rakhili added another two minutes later.
</P>
<P>
It was too late when Deepak Lama pulled one back for Nepal in
the 87th minute.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia finished with three wins, two draws and three defeats
for 11 points to place third. Nepal was fourth on eight points.
</P>
<P>
Japan had already secured top place to join South Korea, China,
Qatar, Kuwait, Bahrain and Kazakhstan for the last Asian
qualifying round for the Olympic competition in the 2000.
</P>
<P>
A draw for the final Asian round from October 1 to November 15
will be held in Los Angeles on July 8.

<HEADLINE> Former Israeli FM Returns to Post </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 4 (Xinhua) -- Former Israeli foreign minister
David Levy will return to his post almost one and a half years
after resigning from the government of outgoing Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel Radio reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
After meeting with Prime Minister-elect Ehud Barak, Levy told
the radio that Barak has officially informed him that he will
become the next foreign minister in the new government, which is
expected to be sworn in Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Levy's appointment has been widely expected since his Gesher
party joined in Barak's One Israel alliance, which combines the
Labor Party, Gesher and the moderate religious party Meimad,
before the May election.
</P>
<P>
Under the alliance agreement, Levy was given the number three
post in the parliamentary list of One Israel, after Barak and
former prime minister Shimon Peres.
</P>
<P>
Barak won a landslide victory in the prime minister race and
his One Israel seized 26 seats in the 120-member parliament.
</P>
<P>
After resigning from the right-wing Likud, Levy formed Gesher,
a party of Middle East Jews, before the 1996 elections. Netanyahu
persuaded him to lead his party into alliance with the Likud in
the election and appointed him foreign minister in the Likud
government.
</P>
<P>
But Levy resigned in January 1998, unhappy with the hard-line
policy of Netanyahu on the peace process and the alleged
mistreatment of the low-income class.
</P>
<P>
With his five-seat Gesher breaking off with the coalition,
Netanyahu's government was pushed to the edge of collapse with
only a slim majority of 61 seats in the 120-member parliament.

<HEADLINE> Kuwaiti Cabinet Resigns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, July 4 (Xinhua) -- The Kuwaiti cabinet Sunday
submitted resignation to Emir Jaber Al-Ahmed Al-Sabah, shortly
after the results of the country's parliamentary elections were
officially announced.
</P>
<P>
The cabinet tabled the mass resignation under the country's
constitution, which stipulates that the government shall resign
once the results of the National Assembly (Parliament) emerged.
</P>
<P>
The emir accepted the cabinet's resignation and entrusted it
to act as a care-taking government until a new cabinet is formed
within two weeks, the official news agency KUNA reported.
</P>
<P>
In his letter to the emir, Crown Prince and Prime Minister
Sheikh Saad Al-Abdullah Al-Salem Al-Sabah said that he was charged
with the premiership task at one of the most critical stages of
the country's history, which required cooperation of all
authoritative departments.
</P>
<P>
"The government had succeeded in making many achievements for
the sake of serving interests of the country and its citizens as
a result of the sincere efforts of the natives," said the minister.
</P>
<P>
The present cabinet was formed in March 1998 after a mass
resignation of the previous government due to a dispute with the
then parliament, which pushed the relations between the executive
and legislative branches into a dead end.
</P>
<P>
Ties between the two authorities often remain a major source of
parliament dissolution and cabinet resignation. Cooperation
crisis triggered by policy differences led to the dissolution of
the last parliament on May 4.
</P>
<P>
According to official results announced earlier Sunday morning,
14 liberals and 20 Islamic candidates, both represent the
opposition groups, were elected to the new parliament in what is
probably the country's last all-male elections.
</P>
<P>
The fact that the opposition ranks enjoy a comfortable
two-thirds majority in the 50-member parliament signals possible
confrontations between the next cabinet and the newly-elected
parliament, analysts here said.

BEIRUT, July 4 (Xinhua) -- One Lebanese was killed and six
others wounded in a shoot-out between the country's two main rival
guerrilla groups in eastern Lebanon's Bekaa valley.
</P>
<P>
The Voice of the People radio Sunday quoted security sources as
saying that Ali Suleiman Horshi, 30, member of the Iranian-backed
Hezbollah, or Party of God, died Sunday after he sustained a
serious injury in a gun battle with members of the Shiite Muslim
Amal movement at Sohmor in Bekaa.
</P>
<P>
The clash erupted from a quarrel and developed into an armed
conflict which led to the intervention of government troops.
</P>
<P>
Six members from both sides have been arrested and the army is
searching for the rest involved in the clash.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah and Amal have long been vying for the leadership of
the country's largest single Shiite Muslim community which
accounts for one third of the country's 3.5 million population.
</P>
<P>
The two groups are also fighting to dislodge Israeli occupation
forces out of south Lebanon where it set up a self-declared
security zone in 1985 with the claimed aim of protecting its north
from Lebanese guerrillas' cross-border attacks.

LUSAKA, July 4 (Xinhua) -- Zambian government said that the
relations between Zambia and Angola is getting better, Sunday Mail
newspaper reported.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Affairs Minister Keli Walubita was quoted by the paper
as saying Saturday in an interview in Ndola, Copperbelt Province,
that the fact Angola sent its deputy minister of defence and
security for the Congo (K) peace talks in Lusaka was an indication
that Angola was ready to restore good relations with Zambia. "This
is a step in the right direction and I am optimistic that the two
countries will once again renew the mutual relationship," Walubita
said.
</P>
<P>
He said that he will be leaving for Algeria on Sunday for an
Organization of African Unity Summit to seek a lasting solution
for the differences between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Walubita said that the meeting held recently between Angola and
Zambia was fruitful. "Another meeting at which further
deliberations will be made is being organized and soon the two
countries shall be good friends again like it was in the past," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Angola had been persistently accusing Zambia of providing
logistical and military support to the Jonas Savimbi-led the

<HEADLINE> Theft Endangers Parliament Treasures </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 4 (Xinhua) -- The recent theft of a
treasured diamond ring from South African Parliament has enraged
the art community and raised fears about the security of the
balance of a 20 million rand (3.3 million U. S. dollars) family
collection left in the state's hands 80 years ago.
</P>
<P>
The ring, worth at least 200,000 rand (33,000 dollars) and
stolen last week, pushes the value of goods stolen from the
Parliament in five years to more than one million rand (166,000
dollars) and raises security concerns at the complex. It also
casts doubt on whether Parliament should be a custodian of
national treasures, the Sunday Times reported.
</P>
<P>
Besides theft, recent flooding of Parliament's basement library
have also damaged valuable books and paintings.
</P>
<P>
The collection, which includes 7,000 books and 300 paintings,
was bequeathed to the South African government by diamond magnate
Sidney Mendlssohn in 1917. It is the second most important
collection of African books in the country -- after that of the
South African Library -- and is estimated to be worth more than 20
million rand (3.3 million dollars).
</P>
<P>
Parliament has been taking stock of what remains of the
collection-- and what may have been stolen from the library after
a spate of thefts over the years.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong Airport Receives 29,298,888th Passenger </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, July 4 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong International
Airport received the 29,298,888th passenger Sunday afternoon since
it began operation one year ago.
</P>
<P>
Shuichi Isaka, a businessman from Tokyo, was lucky to become
the landmark guest in his Hong Kong tour with his wife. He was
greeted by Victor Fung, chairman of the Hong Kong Airport
Authority, on arrival.
</P>
<P>
To mark the first anniversary of the new airport, an exhibition
with the name of "Hong Kong International Airport -- Ready for the
Millennium" opened Sunday at the airport.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the opening ceremony, Fung said the Hong Kong
International Airport serves as an important channel to link Asia
and the world, and airliners leading to some 110 cities worldwide
fly from Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
He noted the passenger and cargo transport volume handled by
the airport increased by 4 percent and 6 percent respectively in
May 1999, compared to the same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
The Hong Kong new airport at Chek Lap Kok started commercial
operation on July 6, 1998, since the old Kai Tak Airport could not
meet the demands of increasing passenger and cargo transportation.
</P>
<P>
When the Northwest Concourse and the second runway go into full
operation, the airport is expected to handle 45 million passengers
and 3 million tons of cargo each year, he said.

<HEADLINE> Boat Accident Kills 3 in Sichuan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, July 4 (Xinhua) -- Three people drowned and over 20
more are still missing who feared dead when a passenger boat
capsized after colliding with a steel bridge on Saturday in
Shehong County of southwest China's Sichuan province.
</P>
<P>
Witnesses of the accident said the engine boat sailed off the
dock at about 11:20 am and the steering device seemed to break
down afterwards. The boat was seen drifting down the Fujiang River
about 500 meters before it ran into a steel bridge and capsized.
The over 40 passengers aboard fell into the river, with 12 of them
rescued and all the others swept away.
</P>
<P>
The sinking site, Jinhua Township of Shehong County, is about
150 kilometers east of the provincial capital Chengdu.
</P>
<P>
Rescure workers organized by the local government recovered
three bodies so far and the salvage work is still under way.

<HEADLINE> Russian Planes' Departure for Kosovo Postponed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, July 4 (Xinhua) -- Denial of air corridors by Hungary,
Romania and Bulgaria forced Russia to postpone the departure of
two military transport aircraft for Kosovo originally scheduled
for early Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The flights have been postponed indefinitely, the Itar-Tass
news agency reported, noting that the three country's refusal to
let Russia use their airspace appeared to be a result of pressure
from the United States.
</P>
<P>
Washington and its NATO allies want to work out details of
Russia's peacekeeping role in the Kosovo before Moscow sends any
new troops to augment its presence of about 400 troops already in
the Yugoslav province.
</P>
<P>
Western media reports said that Russian military negotiators
last week sought to alter an agreement reached earlier in Helsinki
by having their troops in Kosovo report only to Russian officers,
rather than being placed under the formal command of NATO.
</P>
<P>
Russia also reportedly wanted to station forces in the Italian,
French, American and German sectors of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Mistrust has been mounting between Moscow and the U.S.-led NATO
following Russia's surprise deployment of 200 troops to Pristina
airport last month and an usual military exercise about two weeks
ago in which American F-15 jets intercepted Russian fighter-
bombers near Iceland.
</P>
<P>
The two Il-76 planes were to have taken off from the Severny
airport near the city of Ivanovo early Sunday. One plane was to
carry two heavy-duty trucks, technological equipment and a
maintenance team. The other was to take about 100 paratroopers and
a group of reporters to cover the peacekeeping mission in the
Balkans, Tass reported.
</P>
<P>
In another related development, Russia last week ordered an
American military attache to leave the country.
</P>
<P>
Lieutenant-Colonel Peter Hoffman, the assistant Army attache at
the U.S. Embassy in Moscow, was declared persona non grata and
left Russia Thursday evening, The New York Times reported Sunday,
quoting U.S. officials.
</P>
<P>
The expulsion represented another sign of the growing tension
between Moscow and Washington in the aftermath of NATO's 78-day
air strikes against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
It was unclear what caused Hoffman's expulsion. Russia's
Federal Security Service, the main successor to the KGB, refused
to comment, directing the question to the Foreign Ministry, which
remained silent on the incident.
</P>
<P>
According to U.S. officials, Hoffman, a specialist in military
intelligence, participated in the negotiations in Helsinki on
peacekeeping operations in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
One U.S. administration official speculated that the expulsion
might have been a response to a recent decision by the United
States to expel an official at Russia's mission to the United
States on accusations of spying, The New York Times reported.

<HEADLINE> Liberals Make Comeback in Kuwaiti Parliament </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, July 4 (Xinhua) -- Liberals in Kuwait made a
surprising comeback by securing 14 seats in Saturday's parliament
elections, thus adding force to the opposition ranks while dealing
a heavy blow to the government.
</P>
<P>
Official results announced early Sunday morning showed that

liberals, which held only three seats in the last parliament
dissolved in May, secured 14 seats in the 50-member National
Assembly (Parliament) this time.
</P>
<P>
Although pro-Islamic candidates lost four seats by winning only
20 seats, the combined liberal and Islamic opposition now
controls a comfortable two-third majority in the parliament,
indicating potential confrontations between the parliament and
government.
</P>
<P>
Sixteen seats went to other candidates, among whom most are
pro-government tribal figures.
</P>
<P>
The final results also showed that Kuwaiti voters again
extended their support to intellectuals and younger people by
choosing 47 well-educated and young candidates for the new
parliament.
</P>
<P>
Of the 50 new parliament members, over 85 percent received
college or higher education, while more than 55 percent are under
the age of 50.
</P>
<P>
In Saturday's elections, scorching summer heat failed to quit
Kuwaiti voters. Nearly 80 percent of the 113,000 eligible male
voters turned out to cast ballots at 190 polling stations in 25
constituencies nationwide.
</P>
<P>
A total of 288 registered candidates contested in what is
likely to be the country's last all-male elections.
</P>
<P>
Since there are no official political parties in Kuwait,
candidates are representing different government-tolerated
political groups. Some prominent and influential political figures
are even running as independents.
</P>
<P>
The previous parliament was constitutionally dissolved by Emir
Jaber Al-Ahmed Al-Sabah on May 4, on the grounds that the
legislature misused the constitutional rights and violated ethics
and morals of the conservative Gulf Arab state.
</P>
<P>
During the two-month elections campaign, domestic issues,
especially the economic ones, dominated the campaign platforms of
most candidates.
</P>
<P>
The candidates called on the private sector to play a more
important role in the country's economy by employing more
national manpower, and promised to work on it if elected.
</P>
<P>
Some candidates also focused their speeches on the importance
of cooperation between the parliament and government.
</P>
<P>
Cooperation crisis triggered by policy differences led to the
unreconcilable relations between the legislative and executive
authorities, as well as the mass resignation of the former
cabinet in March 1998.

<HEADLINE> Pro-Israeli Militia Leader Decides to Resign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, July 4 (Xinhua) -- Commander of the pro-Israeli South
Lebanon Army (SLA) Antoine Lahd has decided to quit his post one
month after his militia completed a withdrawal from the southern
Lebanese town of Jezzine.
</P>
<P>
The Voice of the People radio Sunday quoted sources coming
from the Israeli occupied border zone in south Lebanon as saying
that the 70-year-old commander had conveyed his resolve to quit
the post to Israeli authorities.
</P>
<P>
He told the Israeli authorities that his decision was
irrevocable and he wanted to go to Paris to meet his family, the
sources said.
</P>
<P>
Lahd's family has been living in France since he survived an
assassination attempt at his house in Marjayoun inside the
occupied zone 10 years ago.
</P>
<P>
Along with other SLA senior officials, Lahd has been sentenced
to death in absentia by a Lebanese military court for
collaborating with Israel which is considered as Lebanon's enemy.
</P>
<P>
The 2,500-strong militia was trained and funded by Israel to
help it patrol the border zone where the Jewish state occupied in
1985 as a buffer zone to protect its north.
</P>
<P>
The militia has been policing Jezzine, the largest Christian
town in south Lebanon, just north of the zone, until it abandoned
it early last month under the pressure of Hezbollah's intensified
bombing attacks around the area.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, is leading a war
of attrition to oust Israeli troops and SLA out of the country.
</P>
<P>
According to the sources, Israel is seeking an alternative
from several candidates to replace Lahd, the radio said.

BEIJING, July 4 (Xinhua) -- Chinese striker Yang Chen, who had
played for the German club of Frankfurt on loan for the past
season, has been transferred to the club, China's first division
club Beijing Guo'An confirmed here on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing-based Chinese club transferred the 25-year-old on a
sum of 3.75 million yuan RMB (0.85 million German marks),
according to the contract signed here last Friday.
</P>
<P>
A former Guo'An striker, Yang had been selected into China's
national team and Olympic side. Last season, he became the first
ever Chinese to play in any first division German club, on loan
for Frankfurt. Yang's team-high eight goals during the season
helped the German club stay in the top division.
</P>
<P>
Terms for Yang's transfer were discussed and settled at talks
with Frankfurt's vice-chairman Gaetano Patella during his earlier
visits to Beijing.
</P>
<P>
At its height in domestic soccer league, Beijing Guo'An
finished runners-up in 1995, the second season of China's

<HEADLINE> No Danger to Zimbabwe's National Unity: Officials </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, June 4 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's ruling Zanu (PF)
officials and some political scientists have ruled out as "total
wishful thinking" predictions that the death of Vice-President
Joshua Nkomo may lead to the end of national unity, the Sunday
Mail reported on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Nkomo died in Harare on Thursday and will be buried at the
National Heroes Acre on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Some pessimists and critics of the Unity Accord between former
Zimbabwe African People's Union (ZAPU) and Zimbabwe African
National Union (ZANU) signed by Nkomo and President Robert Mugabe
on December 22, 1987, had said his death was not just a tragedy
but was a "major test of the unity".
</P>
<P>
Minister of Local Government and National Housing John Nkomo
said there were those people who hope that the unity will
collapse.
</P>
<P>
He said late Nkomo had left a legacy, a legacy of peace and
stability, which had to be nurtured. "We hope that everyone will
do his or her best to see that our unity succeeds," he said.
</P>
<P>
Former secretary of the late veteran nationalist in the days of
the struggle and now Minister of Mines, Environment and Tourism
Simon Moyo said the challenge confronting Zimbabweans was that of
sustaining the unity Nkomo helped forge about 12 years ago.
</P>
<P>
Moyo said late Nkomo was a national Vice-President and not of
Matabeleland province only.
</P>
<P>
"That assertion that unity will collapse can only come from
people who never worked with him, people with a short vision.
Nobody owned him in terms of region, he was not shortsighted,"
Moyo said.
</P>
<P>
A well-known political scientist of Zimbabwe, Professor
Jonathan Moyo said late Nkomo was a man of vision who had realized
the importance of national unity by spearheading the merger of
Zapu and Zanu (PF) in 1987.
</P>
<P>
He said people should only hope that he has not departed with
the peace and that the entire nation was enjoying.
</P>
<P>
On the issue of succession, Moyo said it was very important for
people to realize that no province had a natural right to the
Vice-Presidency, adding that this was better left for the National
Congress to decide.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Shooters Win Women's Trap Title at Worlds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HELSINKI, July 3 (Xinhua) -- Chinese shooters won the women's
team trap title and took the silver medal from the women's skeet
team event at the world shooting championships which opened in
Lempaala on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
In the women's trap competition, Cindy Gentry of the United

<HEADLINE> Automobile Sales in UAE Falling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, July 4 (Xinhua) -- After scoring a record high in
1998, automobile sales in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) are
showing signs of slowing down during the first half of 1999.
</P>
<P>
The shipments of passenger cars and sports utility vehicles
into the UAE during the period are estimated to close at the
28,000-29,000 mark against 35,000 in the first six months of 1998,
down by nearly 15 percent, the Gulf News daily reported on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Total shipments to the local automobile market reached 90,000
units last year, a record high in recent years, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Car industry sources are divided as to the factors causing the
slowdown.
</P>
<P>
"While it may have been difficult to match the record run of
1998, factors for the slowdown appear more deep-rooted. Buyers are
not rushing to the showrooms despite being offered some of the
most competitive rates in years," a senior official with a
U.S. car maker was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
"Our feedback shows that they are more inclined to wait a
while longer and wait for the 2000 models to hit the markets
later this year," he added.
</P>
<P>
However, other sources suggested that high region-wide
inventories for all manufacturers had led to increased price
competition and a distorted sales picture.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Manila Tries Hard to Spur Bank Lending </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 4 (Xinhua) -- If the "Guinness Book of World
Records" listed the frequency of interest rate cuts, then the
Central Bank of the Philippines could be recorded.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, the Central Bank of the Philippines will cut for the
20th time this year its key overnight rates by 12.5 basis points
to encourage a resumption in bank lending.
</P>
<P>
After the new round of rate cut, the bank's overnight borrowing
rate will be reduced to 9 percent from 9.125 percent, while its
lending rate to 11 percent from 11.125 percent.
</P>
<P>
This will bring the bank's cumulative reduction since the start
of the year to 437.5 basis points.
</P>
<P>
"This move along with the 2 percentage point reduction in the
reserve requirement effective yesterday (last Thursday), reflects
the sustained efforts of the Monetary Board (of the central bank)
to bring down the cost of bank lending while ensuring adequate
liquidity in the system," said Central Bank Governor Gabriel
Singson last Friday when he announced the rate cut.
</P>
<P>
To induce banks to relax tight credit conditions, the central
bank last Thursday already cut the reserve requirement of
commercial banks by 2 percentage points to 12 percent, a move that
would release billions of potentially lendable funds into the
banking system.
</P>
<P>
The latest move by the central bank took many people by
surprise, as the U.S. Federal Reserve Board slightly increased its
short-term rates only days ago. The hike, as some people said,
could force other countries to raise their interest rates.
</P>
<P>
But the central bank said the cut in the overnight rates was
undertaken in the belief that the inflation rate for June would be
lower than 6.7 percent registered in May and the U.S. rate hike
would have no bearing at all on the Philippines' domestic market.
</P>
<P>
"The (local) market has already discounted the hike in the Fed
rate," Singson said.
</P>
<P>
Why does the central bank of the Philippines so desperately cut
its overnight rates nearly every week in the past six months?
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the central bank has to do so as the country's
commercial banks still have reservations about extending loans to
companies because they have to clear their book of non-performing
loans.
</P>
<P>
With the volume of total loans contracting and unpaid
obligations mounting, non-performing loans of commercial banks in
the Philippines climbed to 14.48 percent of total loans in April,
compared with 13.18 percent in the previous month.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, despite significant cuts in the central bank's key
rates and its mandatory reserve requirements, commercial banks
have remained tight-fisted.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest figures released by the central bank,
bank lending declined further to 1.68 trillion pesos (about 442
million U.S. dollars) in April, a 2.7-percent contraction from the
year-ago level.
</P>
<P>
As the non-performing ratio has yet to peak this year,
commercial banks in the country are unlikely to change course in
regard to new lending even if the central bank continues to ease
its monetary policy, economists here said.
</P>
<P>
But Singson said the steady drop in interest rates is expected
to boost corporate demand for credit and will also help ease
corporate stress by easing leverage ratios and improving repayment
capacity of firms.
</P>
<P>
Facing a tough task of spurring bank lending, incoming Central
Bank Governor Rafael Buenaventura, who will assume office Monday,
said there will be "no radical changes" in the current monetary
policy, with the focus still on further easing interest rates.

<HEADLINE> Brazil through to Last Eight at Copa America </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUENOS AIRES, July 3 (Xinhua) -- Reigning champions Brazil
advanced into the last eight of the Copa America, or South
American football championships, after winning 2-1 over Mexico in
Ciudad del Este, Paraguay, on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The win added to Brazil's opening 7-0 victory over Venezuela
earlier at the championships.
</P>
<P>
Italy-based duo Ronaldo and Amoroso were obviously the heroes
of the game, with Parma's Amoroso racing onto a pass from the
Inter Milan man to put the Brazilians one up after 19 minutes,
beating Mexico's flamboyant goalkeeper Jorge Campos.
</P>
<P>
Mexico's strikeforce of Luis Hernandez and Cuahtemoc Blanco did
not get the service they needed to really trouble the Mexican
defence.
</P>
<P>
New talent Alex, who plays for Palmeiras, made it 2-0 for the
defending champions when his ferocious shot from 25 yards away
found the net before the halftime.
</P>
<P>
Mexico, who are competing as specially invited guests alongside
Japan, came back strongly in the second period. They narrowed the
gap after 73 minutes through substitute Isaac Terrazas who
replaced Paulo Cesar Chavez at the interval.
</P>
<P>
Brazil had one of the sides' best players sent off seven
minutes from time as Barcelona midfielder Rivaldo was showned a
red card. But that did not stop the South Americans held on for a
deserved 2-1 win over their Central American counterparts.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka to Help Maldives in Drug Detection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, July 4 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka will send narcotics crime
busters for the first time to the Maldives to help it in its fight
against the drug menace, police sources said here Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Two handlers from the Sri Lankan Police Department's kennels
division accompanied by their canine partners will leave for the
Maldives this month, following a formal request for assistance by
the Maldivian government.
</P>
<P>
The Maldives has seen an increase in illegal drugs smuggling
through its air and sea ports. So it has turned to Sri Lanka for
urgent assistance despite being a Muslim nation with a general
aversion toward dogs.
</P>
<P>
The operation to deploy Sri Lankan police personnel will be
fine-tuned regularly and the handlers rotated every three months,
said the sources.
</P>
<P>
The sources said the Maldivians have been impressed by the
professionalism and detection record of the Sri Lankan Police
Department's kennels division.
</P>
<P>
The Maldives is not the only country to have recognized the
caliber of manpower and training at the kennels division, the
sources said.
</P>
<P>
At a recent regional conference of South Asia, Nepal too had
requested training for its police officers in canine crime
busting.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh Eyes Neighboring Electric Wire Markets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, July 4 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh is eyeing the huge
electric wire markets in neighboring countries and hopes to export
its surplus production to India, Nepal and Myanmar, The Daily Star
Business reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Local electric wire manufacturer, Paradise Cables Limited
(PCL), plans to step up its exports to the three countries, a
senior company official was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
"We are particularly looking at markets in India and Nepal
where there is a huge demand for Bangladeshi electric cables,"
said PCL Chairman Mosharraf Hossain.
</P>
<P>
Hossain said the PCL had already received small orders from
these countries and were expecting more from Myanmar. "But we want
to enter the markets in a bigger way."
</P>
<P>
"We need special tariff facilities to compete with the wire
producers of India and other countries," as "only special tariff
facilities could boost our exports to the regional markets since
there is a huge demand for Bangladeshi wires in other South Asian
countries," he said.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh produces 20,000 tons of electric cables annually, of
which the PCL production accounts for 20 percent, and domestic
demand is only 12,000 tons a year, according to Hossain.
</P>
<P>
"We need to export our surplus products which would help reduce
the country's trade gap with neighbors, particularly India," he
said.
</P>
<P>
PCL, which is trying to expand its product range, mainly
imports copper from Chile and aluminum from Australia and India.
"Now we are producing fire-proof cross-linked polyethylene and are
likely to start production optical fiber cables by 2001," he said.
</P>
<P>
Limited demand for optical fiber cables in the country means
that PCL would make such cables for export only. "For home market
production, we need government guarantees for local consumption,"
he said.

<HEADLINE> Chile Keeps Quarterfinals Hopes Alive after Victory </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUENOS AIRES, July 3 (Xinhua) -- Chile overcame a sluggish
start to beat Venezuela 3-0 in Ciudad del Este, Paraguay, on
Saturday and remain in contention for a quarterfinal berth in Copa
America.
</P>
<P>
Ivan Zamorano, Jose Luis Sierra, and Edson Torterolo each
scored a goal in a match marred by red card and rain.
</P>
<P>
Recovering from a stunning 7-0 loss to Brazil, Venezuela had to
play most of the Saturday game with 10 players, after Rolando
Alvarez was sent off in the 17th minute for fouling Chilean
striker Marcelo Salas.
</P>
<P>
With a man advantage and Venezuela's defense exposing gaping
holes, the Chileans launched wave upon wave of attacks, only
missing several easy chances through Zamorano and Salas.
</P>
<P>
Zamorano penetrated deep into Venezuela's defense, and was
managing to maneuver around goalkeeper Renny Vega to make a lethal
shot. But the ball was pushed away by a Venezuela defender before
it crossed the goal line.
</P>
<P>
Chile's numerical advantage was gone minutes near the end of
the first half when Jorge Vargas received a red card. Chile's
Salas was sent off in the second half and will not play in the
next game against Brazil.
</P>
<P>
Brazil leads Group B with six points. Chile and Mexico are
tied for the second place with three points each.

<HEADLINE> Cabinet Reshuffle Only Covers Vacant Posts: Thai PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, July 4 (Xinhua) -- Only vacant posts will be refilled
in the upcoming government reshuffle, Channel 9, the state TV
station, Sunday morning quoted Thai Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai
as saying.
</P>
<P>
Speaking Saturday night upon his arrival in Bangkok from
provinces, Chuan said fresh blood is expected to be absorbed into
the cabinet.
</P>
<P>
Chuan had said earlier that the post of Deputy Prime Minister
and Commerce Minister Supachai Panitchpakdi, who is running for
the director-generalship of the World Trade Organization (WTO),
will remain intact since the WTO race is unlikely to produce any
result before the reshuffle.
</P>
<P>
At present, seven cabinet seats are vacant, including those of
deputy agriculture minister, education minister, science minister,
deputy science minister, deputy transportation and communication
minister, deputy industry minister and a deputy prime minister.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka to Buy Russian Warships </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, July 4 (Xinhua) -- A top-level Sri Lankan delegation
is visiting the Russian Federation to explore the possibility of
purchasing three warships to counter Tamil rebels' arms smuggling,
press reports here said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"The government sent the delegation to inspect several warships
after Russia responded positively to a Sri Lankan bid for fighting
ships that once belonged to the powerful Warsaw Pact fleet,"
reported the Sunday Island.
</P>
<P>
Russian vessels had been in service with the Sri Lankan Navy
(SLN) years ago. However, since the civil war erupted in 1983, Sri
Lanka has not acquired fighting ships from Russia.
</P>
<P>
The vessels on offer are bigger and more powerful than the
SLN's biggest vessel Shakthi, a Chinese-built landing ship tank.
</P>
<P>
The acquisition of big vessels will considerably improve the
SLN's capability to counter Tamil rebels' arms smuggling
operations in international waters, said defense sources.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka has been forced to request for Indian naval and air
assistance to counter Tamil rebels' arms smuggling operations due
to lack of big vessels.
</P>
<P>
There are 23 big vessels in the SLN's fleet of 148 craft
deployed against Tamil rebels who have been fighting for a
homeland for minority Tamils in Sri Lanka's north and east since
1983.
</P>
<P>
Navy Commander Vice Admiral Cecil Tissera recently said the
government has identified the need to wage a proper campaign
against Tamil rebels' sea capability.
</P>
<P>
The prestigious Jane's Fighting Ships in its latest issue has
quoted Sri Lankan President Chandrika Kumaratunga as saying, "If
we had upgraded our navy earlier, the problem of Tamil separatist
terrorism would not have taken the present form."
</P>
<P>
It described Kumaratunga's remarks as an unusual tribute to the
importance of sea power, even in local confrontations, for an
island nation.

<HEADLINE> Sino-Singaporean Industrial Park Reports Investment Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SUZHOU, July 4 (Xinhua) -- The Suzhou Industrial Park, a Sino-
Singaporean joint project built in 1994 in Suzhou, a scenic city
in east China's Jiangsu Province, has reported a big increase in
investment from overseas this year.
</P>
<P>
The park approved projects with a combined contractual overseas
capital of 450 million U.S. dollars for the first half of the year,
bringing the total overseas investment to 6.3 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Among this year's new overseas investors are six of the world's
top 500 companies: AMP Connector Tool Ltd., Alcatel
Telecommunications Co., Ltd., EKA Chemicals Co., Ltd., LJF Co.,
Ltd., Cutler-Hammer Electric Co., Ltd., and Mitsui Copper Foil Co.,
Ltd..
</P>
<P>
The existing overseas-funded enterprises in the park have shown
a definite propensity to expand their operations. Of the 450
million U.S. dollars, 47 percent is newly added by these
enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The Suzhou Industrial Park has led the country's other
development zones in successful expansion, with each overseas-
funded project involving an average of over 30 million U.S.
dollars of investment.
</P>
<P>
So far, some 155 overseas-funded enterprises have been
established in the park, 34 of which are backed by the world's top
companies.

<HEADLINE> China to Tighten Controls on Foreign Tobacco Operations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
BEIJING, July 4 (Xinhua) -- China is starting to tighten
controls on foreign tobacco companies' operations in China, the
China Daily Business Weekly reported on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The move aims to step up controls on the number of standing
representative offices and the level of sales promotion activities
of the foreign tobacco companies.
</P>
<P>
A circular issued recently by the State Tobacco Monopoly
Administration, the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Co-
operation and the State Administration for Industry and Commerce
stipulate that foreign tobacco companies applying to increase
their number of representative offices to over two will have to
meet either of the following two requirements.
</P>
<P>
-- Over 10 million U.S. dollars in annual cigarette and cigar
exports to China in the previous two years on average.
</P>
<P>
-- Technical co-operation with Chinese cigarette manufacturers
with the permission of the State Tobacco Monopoly Administration.
</P>
<P>
But even for those privileged tobacco companies, the total
number of representative offices will not be allowed to exceed 10.
</P>
<P>
"We have tightened the controls because they are in a mess now,
" an official from the State Tobacco Monopoly Administration, told
the weekly.
</P>
<P>
Few restrictions had been imposed on the number of
representative offices in the past. As a result, some foreign
tobacco businesses have established more than 30 such offices in
China.

<HEADLINE> Experts Urge to Develop Alternate Energy in Colombia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, July 3 (Xinhua) -- Colombia should develop
alternate sources of energy, experts of the Mining and Energy
Ministry said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Colombia has a high potential for the development of alternate
sources of energy, but the high cost of research and development
has prevented their mass production, said Josue Zapata and Luis
Carlos Romero, experts from the ministry.
</P>
<P>
They said that Colombia has the resources, the technology, and
the needs to implement this kind of energy sources, but coherence
is needed in the nation policies to define the projects.
</P>
<P>
They explained that alternate energy sources are not
competitive in a big scale, because they are very costly compared
to the one that can be produced with the traditional methods.
</P>
<P>
However, they said this situation will be solved in the medium
term.
</P>
<P>
Wind generated energy was basically used to pump up underground
water, mainly in the northern regions, such as the Guajira, on the
border with Venezuela.
</P>
<P>
Some systems to generate electric energy in a small scale have
been installed.

<HEADLINE> Messer to Raise China Investment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
BEIJING, July 4 (Xinhua) -- The German-based Messer Group, one
of the world's biggest industrial gas producers, plans to expand
its investment in China as part of the company's global strategy,
the China Daily Business Weekly reported today.
</P>
<P>
Messer, which has 17 joint ventures in China, will increase
its investment in China from 190 million U.S. dollars to 300
million by 2000, according to Herbert Rudolf, president of the
Company.
</P>
<P>
Its latest move designed in June is to set up a carbon dioxide
joint venture with the Zhenhai Refinery Co Ltd in Ningbo in east
China's Zhejiang Province, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
The venture, involving a total investment of 7.7 million U.S.
dollars, will have an annual output of 50,000 tons of carbon
dioxide used in food freezing and beverage businesses.
</P>
<P>
Messer is also negotiating with the China Petrochemical
Corporation Group for projects involving 100 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Rudolf said China could soon become the first or second
industrial gas market in the world owing to its sustained economic
growth.
</P>
<P>
"When we entered the Chinese market in 1994, we established a
10-year development plan to become the largest supplier of
industrial gas in China and we are progressing very smoothly
towards this goal," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the group's sales volume in China was expected to
reach 500 million yuan (60 million U.S. dollars) this year and
would rise to 2 billion yuan (240.9 million U.S. dollars) in 2003.

<HEADLINE> China Moves to Tackle Ceramics Oversupply </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 4 (Xinhua) -- China's sanitary ceramic ware
industry is facing structural supply difficulties.
</P>
<P>
The main problem is that production of low-class sanitary
ceramics exceeds demand while the industry's enterprises are
unable to meet demand for high-grade products, said a China Daily
report today.
</P>
<P>
Industry experts told the newspaper that output of high-grade
sanitary ceramics only accounted for between ten and 15 percent of
the total.
</P>
<P>
Output of sanitary ceramics totaled 54 to 55 million items in
1997, and output this year is not expected to increase much.
</P>
<P>
But demand last year was only 30 million items, with the demand
for high-grade products accounting for 20 percent of this.
</P>
<P>
Experts predict that demand for sanitary ceramics will rise in
the next few years as the Chinese Government takes measures to
stimulate the real estate market.
</P>
<P>
But demand this year will not grow much since it will take some
time for the economy to see the effects of the government's action,
especially in sectors such as the building materials sector.
</P>
<P>
The industry authority has set a goal of increasing output of
high-grade sanitary ceramics to 25 percent of the total by 2000.
</P>
<P>
It is also expected to eliminate part of the production
capacity of low-class products.
</P>
<P>
The oversupply in the medium- and low-grade sanitary ceramics
sector has contributed to a price war, which has slashed profit
margins.
</P>
<P>
Some sanitary ceramic manufacturers make inferior products to
try to balance income and expenditure, which has hampered the
healthy progress of the industry.
</P>
<P>
There are 400 enterprises producing sanitary ceramics across
the nation, one fourth of which are funded by overseas investment.
</P>
<P>
In the first quarter of this year, China exported 459,161 items
of sanitary ceramics worth 5.88 million US dollars, up 18.5 and 71.
6 percent from the same period of last year.

<P>
BRASILIA, July 3 (Xinhua) -- Brazil is working on a sustainable
development program for forestry resources, the Environment
Ministry said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The program -- National Forestry Program (Pronaflor) --
foresees the planting of six million hectares of forests with an
annual output of 150 million cubic meters of lumber and 1.5
million job opportunities.
</P>
<P>
The program will be jointly implemented by the Environment
Ministry, the Brazilian Institute of the Environment and Renewable
Natural Resources and the private sector.
</P>
<P>
Brazil has an area of 442 million hectares of forests with a
wood reserve of 65.8 billion cubic meters.
</P>
<P>
The forest area has shrunk over the past years because of the
excessive exploitation.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Not to Build New Venues in Bid For Asiad </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 4 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia will not build any new
sports venues to support its bid to host the 2006 Asian Games,
chairman of the Gelora Senayan Management Board Muladi said.
</P>
<P>
Muladi, also Minister of Justice/State Secretary, said that
instead of constructing new venues, which would cost a lot of
money, the government preferred to renovate its 100 hectares of
sports complexes to host the quadrennial event.
</P>
<P>
"It's really difficult to build a new sports complex because it
costs a lot of money. It's better to renovate sports venues
around the capital since they still meet international standard,"
he was quoted by The Jakarta Post Sunday as saying.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia's bid to host the 2006 Asiad must be submitted in
October 2000. The proposal must contain information on available
funds, sports facilities, athletes' village, media center,
transportation, catering and security.
</P>
<P>
The Senayan sports complex was built by Indonesia's first
president Soekarno to host the fourth Asian Games in 1962. The
complex has a 110,000-seat soccer stadium, a track and field
stadium, an indoor stadium, indoor halls, a swimming pool, clay
and rebound ace surface tennis stadiums, squash courts, an
artificial surface hockey field, an archery range, a shooting
range, a basketball hall, a volleyball hall, a badminton hall and
sand volleyball courts.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia will face tough challenges from other bidders --
Malaysia, Hong Kong, India, Qatar, Syria and Uzbekstan.
</P>
<P>
The National Sports Council has set up a special team to lobby
members of the Olympic Council of Asia.

BEIJING, July 4 (Xinhua) -- Following are the highlights of
today's major Beijing-based newspapers:
</P>
<P>

 "China Daily"
</P>
<P>
-- A new savings option offering higher interest rates, "
educational savings" by name, will soon be unveiled to encourage
the Chinese people to lay up money for the education of their
children, as a part of the government's effort to stimulate the
development of an education industry.
</P>
<P>
-- China is to engage the power of non-state capital to widen
options for spending on schooling and help raise the quality of
the country's labor force. In the new financing system of
education, non-state capital will play the major role in non-
compulsory schooling.
</P>
<P>
"Beijing Daily"
</P>
<P>

level grain reserve system is expected to alleviate the pressure
on that of the city, which needs to store a total of five billion
kilograms of grain annually.

<P>
MEXICO CITY, July 3 (Xinhua) -- Sterility affects 12 percent of
all couples in the world and 20 percent of these couples try vitro
fertilization, according to a study by a Mexican researcher
published here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Arnoldo Guzman, member of the University of Guadalajara
Sciences of Health Center, said that artificial method does not
have the same acceptance level in different countries.
</P>
<P>
All fertilization programs, such as sperm banks and the
practice in which women accept the implanting of an ovule
fertilized in an artificial medium, are legal in Mexico, he said.
</P>
<P>
However, artificial reproduction method has its social
limitations, "because it is an intimate matter, costly, and with
religious and ethical implications," said Guzman.

<P>
HELSINKI, July 3 (Xinhua) -- European Union (EU) industry
ministers Saturday agreed that EU countries must improve education
in information and communications technology in order to have
enough work force in this field.
</P>
<P>
Concluding a two-day informal meeting in Oulu, western Finland,
the ministers said a large and qualified labor force is essential
to ensure EU enterprises' competitive edge on the international
market in the next millennium.
</P>
<P>
The ministers also called for more investment in information
technology, to catch up with the United States and Japan, and to
strengthen software service.
</P>
<P>
With "Competitiveness In The Information Society" as main theme,
a summary report was worked out at the meeting to be submitted to
their formal meeting scheduled later this season.
</P>
<P>
The Oulu session, the first at the ministerial level hosted by
Finland after it took over the rotating EU presidency from Germany
on July 1, was shadowed by the boycott of Germany and Austria in
protest of Helsinki's refusal to add German to its working
languages.
</P>
<P>
Under normal EU practice, English, French and the language of
the EU presidency holder are used at informal meetings.

<HEADLINE> Casual Wear Industry Burgeoning in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 4 (Xinhua) -- Casual wear is enjoying widespread
favor from Chinese consumers nowadays and has become one of the
most important elements of China's garment industry, reported the
China Daily's Sunday edition Business Weekly.
</P>
<P>
The advantages of such clothing become more notable since the
current heatwave makes life very uncomfortable for workers trapped
by inflexible company dress codes into wearing suits and ties and
other inappropriate clothing.
</P>
<P>
"As weekends draw near, I almost cannot wait to throw off my
uniform and put on my casual wear," said Sun Yi, an employee of a
US-based company in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
China's casual wear is important for injecting new vitality
into the garment industry, given the currently lackluster domestic
demand and global economic slowdown, said Jiang Hengjie, board
chairman of the China Garment Association.
</P>
<P>
Statistics from the China Commercial Information Center
indicate that China exported more than nine billion garments last
year, up four percent from 1997. Of these, almost 25 percent were
casual wear.
</P>
<P>
A second reason for the increasing popularity of casual wear in
China is that people have more spare time than ever before as a
result of the implementation of the two-day weekend in 1994.
</P>
<P>
"Casual wear has become a new economic growth area for the
garment industry, since it is now inseparable from people's daily
life, especially for urban citizens," Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
"Although it is still in its primitive stage, the industry is
maintaining a high growth momentum," he added.
</P>
<P>
However, problems such as mediocre design, low quality
accessories and backward knitting skills have hindered the
development of the industry.
</P>
<P>
"Most of the design of the casual wear in China merely copies
from the Western style," said Wang Qin, Secretary-general of the
China Fashion Designers Association.

</P>
<P>
The alliance expects the Russians this week to continue talks
on the requested revisions, according to an Associated Press
report.
</P>
<P>
Russia wants to send some of its troops into sectors of Kosovo
controlled by other NATO countries beyond the U.S., Germany and
France.
</P>
<P>
However, Washington and its allies believe that Moscow's demand
would change an agreement reached in lengthy negotiations last
month at Helsinki, Finland, that outlined Russian participation in
a NATO-led peacekeeping force.
</P>
<P>
The AP quoted a U.S. official as saying that NATO will continue
to work with Russian military on the arrangements for Russia's
participation.
</P>
<P>
"It is NATO's view that we should complete all of these
arrangements before additional Russian forces deploy to Kosovo,"
the unidentified official said.
</P>
<P>
The talks between NATO and Russia will last seven to 10 days at
the Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe to work out
deployment details.
</P>
<P>
Russia reportedly asked Hungary, Romania and Bulgaria late last
week for corridors through which Ilyushin cargo planes could fly
soldiers to join about 700 Russian troops and technicians already
in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
NATO member Hungary and Romania and Bulgaria, both of which
want to join the alliance, rejected the requests, the AP said.
</P>
<P>
Russia strongly opposed NATO's bombing of Yugoslavia, which has
strained the relations between Moscow and the West.
</P>
<P>
Despite efforts by U.S. President Bill Clinton and Russian
President Boris Yeltsin to mend the fences last month at the G-8
summit in Germany, disputes still remain on Russia's participation
of peacekeeping in Kosovo.

<HEADLINE> Sampras to Meet Agassi in Wimbledon Men's Final </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 3 (Xinhua) -- Defending champion Pete Sampras and
fellow American Andre Agassi will vie for the men's singles title
of the Wimbledon tennis championships on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Top seed Sampras defeated local hero Tim Henman 3-6, 6-4, 6-3,
6-4 on Saturday and is on course for his sixth title in seven
years -- a record this century.
</P>
<P>
Fourth seed Agassi outclassed Australian second seed Pat Rafter
7-5, 7-6, 6-2 and is now just one win away from being the first
player for 19 years to win the French Open and Wimbledon titles in
the same season.
</P>
<P>
Agassi's win returned him to the top of the rankings,
surpassing Sampras, for the first time since February 1996 and
caps an extraordinary comeback by the American who was ranked
122nd at the end of 1997.
</P>
<P>
"It's a highly anticipated match, by everybody including myself.
I haven't played Pete in a big match in a long time," Agassi, the
1992 champion, said. "You should see some fireworks out there --
I'm really looking forward to it."
</P>
<P>
It is the first all-American final since 1993 and pitches the
best grass-court player of his generation -- Sampras -- against
the most versatile shot-maker of the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
In 23 matches they have played only once on grass, at Wimbledon
in 1993, a quarter-final match which gave Sampras one of his 13
victories in a rivalry going back to junior days.
</P>
<P>
"We have played consistently over the years and with our
different games and personalities, it's a great match-up. There's
a lot of respect we have for one another," said Sampras.
</P>
<P>
"I have to use the surface to my advantage and go out and play
some good tennis."
</P>
<P>
If he wins on Sunday Sampras will equal the record of 12 Grand
Slam titles held by Australian Roy Emerson.
</P>
<P>
Seven times champion Steffi Graf meets world number one Lindsay
Davenport of the U.S. in the women's final on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Graf came from a set down to claim a 6-7, 6-4, 6-3 win over 17-
year-old Croatian Mirjana Lucic on Saturday while Lindsay
Davenport ended the dream run of compatriot Alexandra Stevenson,
the first woman qualifier to reach the Wimbledon last four.
</P>
<P>
Davenport's clinical 6-1, 6-1 victory took her into her first
Wimbledon final and back to the top of the world rankings,
toppling Martina Hingis, the Swiss top seed beaten in the first
round here.
</P>
<P>
The final pitches the form player of the past six weeks, Graf,
who won the French Open last month, against the U.S. Open champion,
who has finally learned to love playing on grass.
</P>
<P>
They have played each other 13 times since 1994, with Graf
emerging victorious eight times. However, they have yet to meet
on a grass court and Davenport, 23, knows the 30-year-old Graf is
at her most dangerous at Wimbledon.
</P>
<P>
"Grass is Steffi's best surface and, along with Martina
Navratilova, she is one of the best grass-court players ever.
</P>
<P>
"You have to be aggressive against her on grass. You have to
hit the ball hard and keep it deep, and then do everything else
well," she said.
</P>
<P>
Davenport had never gone past the quarter-finals in six
previous visits to Wimbledon but she fears nobody after not losing
a set and conceding just 28 games in six rounds in 1999.
</P>
<P>
"It's going to be difficult to win, but I'm feeling great and
very relaxed. It will be a very exciting moment," she added.
</P>
<P>
Graf knows that one of her main weapons -- her serve -- will
have to improve in her ninth final at the All England Club.
</P>
<P>
She struggled in the first set against Lucic, losing her serve
four times. "I definitely have to serve better than I did against
Lucic.
</P>
<P>
"Like Mirjana, Davenport will go for her returns. She's going
to try and put the pressure on from the start, but if I can serve
well, I might be able to keep her on the move while she's serving.
"
</P>
<P>
If she beats Davenport, it will be Graf's 23rd Grand Slam
singles crown, putting her just one adrift of the record held by
Margaret Court.
</P>
<P>
After winning the French Open last month for the sixth time she
retired from the Roland Garros tournament. But Graf has said it
would be "tempting" to come back to Wimbledon next year if she
manages to capture her eighth title on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Such a situation would present her with a chance of equaling
Navratilova's record nine singles wins at Wimbledon.

<HEADLINE> Teenage Challenge Ends in Semis at Wimbledon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 3 (Xinhua) -- The last of the impressive young
teenagers at this year's Wimbledon have been beaten in the women's
semi-finals.
</P>
<P>
Alexandra Stevenson, 16, and 17-year-old Mirjana Lucic both
lost to their more experienced opponents.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Open champion Lindsay Davenport and seven times Wimbledon
winner Steffi Graf will now meet in the final.
</P>
<P>
But whereas Davenport breezed to a 6-1, 6-1 win over fellow
American Stevenson in 47 minutes, Graf had to come from a set down
against Lucic.
</P>
<P>
The score of 6-7 (3/7), 6-4, 6-3 reflected what a tough job the
German was given by the young talent from Croatia.
</P>
<P>
But Stevenson's attempt to become the first women's qualifier
to reach a Wimbledon final ended in tears on Center Court as
Davenport's power -- and the occasion -- overcame her. The
nervous teenager lost the first 11 points of the match.
</P>
<P>
And although she improved to force a number of Davenport
service games to deuce she could not break through.
</P>
<P>
The end came when Davenport produced a perfect love service
game and Stevenson sent a wild forehand way over the baseline.
</P>
<P>
The victory also ensures that older American replaces Martina
Hingis as world no 1.
</P>
<P>
Afterwards Davenport was relieved she had been able to grab the
initiative early in the match.
</P>
<P>
"She had been playing freely and loose, so I knew it was
important to get off to a good start," Davenport said.
</P>
<P>
"I think she was a little too excited and missed a lot of shots
she'd been making in the this tournament."
</P>
<P>
Graf remains on course for an eighth Wimbledon title but Lucic
produced some brilliant ground strokes to thrill the crowd on
Court One.
</P>
<P>
Graf raised her game in the second and third sets to claim the
win after losing the opener on a tie-break.
</P>
<P>
That set saw eight breaks of serve broken by Graf holding hers
on one occasion midway through the run.
</P>
<P>
Lucic recovered from a double fault on the first point of the
tie-break and took the next five points in a row and eventually
the set.
</P>
<P>
The second set went with serve until Lucic served to stay in
the set at 4-5.
</P>
<P>
She made an uncharacteristic basic error on set point, putting
a straightforward volley wide to allow Graf to draw level.
</P>
<P>
The momentum had swung firmly in the German's favor and she
made the crucial break in the second game of the deciding set by
forcing Lucic to volley into the net before putting a backhand
long.
</P>
<P>
Lucic kept fighting to the end but Graf's serve had improved
hugely since the opening set and yet another Wimbledon final
beckons.

<P>
HAIKOU, July 4 (Xinhua) -- South China's Hainan Province
exported 35,000 tons of aquatic products in the first half of this
year, up 10.3 percent from the year-ago period of last year.
</P>
<P>
In addition to export growth in silver anchovies, sierra, and
prawns, some marine byproducts made by local processing
enterprises such as agar, fish mucus and alga were sold well in
Japan, the Republic of Korea, Taiwan and Macao.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that the fresh aquatic products export
accounted for 20-25 percent of the province's total aquatic
products export. Baimajin fishing harbor alone exported 1,200 tons
of frozen fish chips to Japan in the first six months.
</P>
<P>
A local aquatic production official attributes the export
increase to last year's 11.7 percent increase in fishing
production and 993 hectares of production area added for the

<HEADLINE> Canada Getting Three New National Parks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, July 3 (Xinhua) -- Canada is getting three new national
parks this Summer in the country's far north new territory of
Nunavut, local media said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
After four years of talks, the Canadian cabinet and the Inuit
have ratified a deal on the establishment of three Arctic national
parks of Sirmilik, Auyuittug and Quttinirtaaq, adding 80,000
square kilometers of land to national parkland.
</P>
<P>
The Inuktitut names, meaning "place of glaciers," "land that
never melts," and "top of the world," were chosen to illustrate
the frozen terrain's major features, which are being described as
exotic northern gems.
</P>
<P>
"This is a way for the Inuit to connect with the rest of
Canada," said Paul Amagoalik, a chief Inuit negotiator of the
deal.
</P>
<P>
He told reporters that "the parks will highlight things that
you can't find anywhere else in the world."
</P>
<P>
Canadian Heritage Minister Sheila Copps is scheduled to visit
Pond Inlet on Baffin Island in August for the official signing of
the agreement.

<HEADLINE> Rebuilding Aid Issue Worries Balkan Leaders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, July 3 (Xinhua) -- Leaders of the Balkan countries
are concerned over the West's initial promises of substantial aid
for the whole of South-Eastern Europe since they believed that the
aid of reconstruction appeared to have been watered down.
</P>
<P>
The West has promised a huge new "Marshall Plan" of the aid for
Balkan reconstruction, but the sums are steadily shrinking while
the focus was being narrowed to Kosovo itself, according to a
twice-weekly European Report issued on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The European Union (EU)'s publication said that Leaders from
Macedonia, Albania, Bulgaria and Romania accused the West at a
meeting on Thursday of backsliding on its promises of aid to help
rebuild countries in South-Eastern Europe hurt by the Kosovo
conflict.
</P>
<P>
"There is fear that what has been promised will be prolonged to
an unspecified time. The stability pact is being delayed from
month to month," Macedonian Prime Minister Ljubco Georgievski said
at the Central and Eastern European economic summit. "Now we see
that it will come through only in September, then it may be pushed
into a new budgetary year," he said, adding "This is creating
dissatisfaction among us".
</P>
<P>
The European Commission, the EU's executive arm, has said that
the cost of reconstruction in Kosovo and neighboring Balkan
countries is set to weigh down the entire EU budget procedure and
create tensions between the Council of Ministers and the European
Parliament, the other two arms of the European Union.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, EU sources said finance ministers from the Group of
Seven (G7) industrialized countries and the major international
financial bodies, namely the International Monetary Fund, World
Bank, and European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, will
meet in Brussels on July 13 to discuss Balkans reconstruction.
They were said to prepare the ground for a donor conference at the
end of the month.
</P>
<P>
Macedonia, Albania, Bulgaria and Romania all suffered
economicly because of the NATO bombing against Yugoslavia.
Macedonia and Albania have hosted ethnic Kosovo Albanian refugees
since the airstrike started on March 24.
</P>
<P>
The Balkan leaders have call on foreign companies to take steps
as soon as possible to invest in the war-hit countries for
economic reconstruction.
