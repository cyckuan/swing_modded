BEIJING, April 8 (Xinhua) -- A recent survey by the China
Non-Governmental Science and Technology Entrepreneurs Association
shows that the number of non-government science and technology
enterprises has grown a great deal in the past several years.
</P>
<P>
This type of enterprises now number more than 90,000, and have
some two million employees, with technical personnel accounting
for 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
According to the survey, the annual income of this sector has
currently exceeded 300 billion yuan (about 37 billion US dollars).
</P>
<P>
Non-government science and technology enterprises appeared
after the country adopted reform and opening-up policies in the
late 1970s. By now, many of them, such as the famous
Beida-Founders group company, have grown very competitive in the
international market.
</P>
<P>
The China Non-Governmental Science and Technology Entrepreneurs
Association was established in April of 1987, and held its 10th
anniversary celebration in Beijing today.

<P>
BEIJING, April 8 (Xinhua) -- China's State Planning Commission
(SPC) today named 129 projects as "key national construction

<P>
The majority involve basic industries designated by the state

Among them are four coal mine development projects in Shanxi

limited resources away from the key projects.
</P>
<P>
It also urged everyone involved to tackle problems like land,
equipment, water, and electricity for the key projects, on time.

Inappropriate fees on key projects should be strictly halted,

<HEADLINE> IRA Claims Responsibility for Grand National Bomb Alerts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 8 (Xinhua) -- The Irish Republican Army (IRA) has
claimed responsibility for the two bomb alerts that caused massive
emergency evacuation and brought the postponement of the
traditional Grand National horse-racing event.
</P>
<P>
The claim was made today by an unnamed caller using a
recognized IRA code word to Ireland's semi-state RTE broadcasting
network, according to reports from Dublin.
</P>
<P>
An RTE spokesman quoted the caller as saying that such actions
would not be needed if the British government adopted a
constructive attitude to the Northern Ireland peace process.
</P>
<P>
"The IRA were responsible for the disruption of the Grand
National in England on Saturday. We remind John Major that had he
given as much importance to the negotiating of an end to the
conflict in Northern Ireland over the past few years as he
attaches to the disruption of a single sporting event, a lasting
peace settlement would have been closer," the caller said in the
statement.
</P>
<P>
The British government has repeatedly made it clear that Sinn
Fein, the political wing of the IRA, would not be admitted into
the all-party peace talks until the IRA guerillas call a permanent
cease-fire and hand over all its arms.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Treasury Secretary Eases Vietnam Debt Burden </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, April 8 (Xinhua) -- United States Treasury Secretary
Robert Rubin left Ho Chi Minh City today, ending his three-day
visit to Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
It was the first visit by a U.S. treasury secretary to Vietnam
since the Vietnam war ended in 1975.
</P>
<P>
Rubin held talks with his Vietnamese counterpart in Hanoi
Monday, and signed an accord after the talks to reschedule a
debt of 145 million U.S. dollars accumulated by the former Saigon
regime during the war.
</P>
<P>
Under the accord, Vietnam will pay 8.5 million U.S. dollars
within 30 days while the rest of the debt will be rescheduled by
stages within the next 22 years.
</P>
<P>
Rubin described the signing as "an important step towards
normalization between the two countries, and the entry by Vietnam
into the international financial community."
</P>
<P>
Vietnamese Vice Foreign Minister for American Affairs Nguyen
Dinh Bin said the signing was a positive indication of the two
countries' determination to "end the past and open the future."
</P>
<P>
During his visit, Rubin met separately with Secretary General
of the Vietnamese Communist Party Do Muoi today, and Prime
Minister Vo Van Kiet Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Vietnamese leaders told Rubin there were positive signs
since normalization between the two countries, especially in the
economic fields.
</P>
<P>
But they argued that relations between the two countries had
not been fully normalized, and Vietnam was not responsible for the
slow progress the two had made in normalizing their economic
relationship.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam looked to enhance the economic and trade cooperation
with the United States, they stressed.
</P>
<P>
The bilateral trade volume hit 935 million U.S. dollars in
1996, double that of the previous year. The United States has
invested 1.2 billion U.S. dollars in Vietnam, and was its eighth
biggest foreign investor.

DHAKA, April 8 (Xinhua) -- Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh
Hasina today made a clarion call to investors and entrepreneurs
from home and abroad to come forward with their capital and
technology.
</P>
<P>
Inaugurating the expansion project of Dhaka Export Processing
Zone (EPZ), the prime minister assured the investors of all
possible cooperation and assistance to reduce production cost and
fetch maximum profits.
</P>
<P>
"The investors can utilize the world's most inexpensive labor
force available in Bangladesh and the highly competitive package
of fiscal and nonfiscal incentives and facilities, being provided
by my government," Hasina claimed.
</P>
<P>
The expansion project of Dhaka EPZ, situated on 214 acres,
would have 260 industrial plots each having 2,000 square meters.
The government has taken up the project on July 25, last year
while physical possession of the land was taken on January 19 this
year.
</P>
<P>
In less than two months 50 percent of the construction work on
the physical infrastructure was completed and the project is
expected to be completed in the next two years, said official
sources, adding that this would be a record in implementing such a
project in this country in such a short time.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister told the gathering that the industrial
policy of her government was aimed at accelerating the growth of
export oriented industries through an appropriately designed
export strategy, which is expected to reduce the country's huge
trade imbalance.
</P>
<P>
The government has undertaken massive programs worldwide to
achieve this objective, said Hasina, adding that 1997 has been
declared as the year of investment in Bangladesh, one of the most
undeveloped countries in the world.

</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, leftists intensified attacks against nuclear waste
transport, said a government report released today.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, the number of active right wing extremists in Germany
fell slightly, to 45,300 from 46,100 in the previous year. They
were responsible for 507 violent attacks causing injury, two less
than in 1995, as well as for 33 arsons, compared with 45 in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The overall number of "rightist" crimes rose to 8,730, an
increase of 834 cases. Many of the cases resulted in convictions
for distributing neo-Nazi propaganda, said the annual report on
extremism in Germany, presented by the Office for the Protection
of the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
Anti-Semitic crimes declined by 27 percent from 1995, to 846,
while violent cases climbed to 29 last year from 27 in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The only death caused by neo-Nazis in 1996, which was also the
only such death reported in the past three years, occurred in the
eastern German state of Brandenburg, where neo-Nazi violence was
most frequent.
</P>
<P>
The report showed that eastern Germany suffered the highest per
capita rates of neo-Nazi violence last year, with Brandenburg
topping the list with 3.35 attacks per 100,000 inhabitants,
followed by Mecklenburg-West Pomerania, with 2.95.
</P>
<P>
The report voiced concern over the increasing number of male
youths involved in violent rightest attacks, noting that over 66
percent of the 751 people convicted of such crimes in 1996 were
aged 16 to 20, and only four percent were female.
</P>
<P>
The left-wing extremists totalled 32,500 last year, and were
held by the report to be responsible for 932 attacks, down from
965 in 1995. They included 30 violent cases resulting in injury,
compared with 35 in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The report said leftists carried out 154 attacks on transport
systems last year, up from 114 in 1995, leading to huge repair
bills. It noted that one million marks (588,000 U.S. dollars) was
spent only to replace a mast carrying overhead rail power lines
which was cut down last May near Hanover.
</P>
<P>
In particular, leftists intensified assaults on railways used
for shipping nuclear waste to a storage depot in Lower Saxony
state, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The report showed that Berlin, with its traditional left-wing
background, recorded the highest level of leftist violence last
year, with 5.07 such crimes per 100,000 inhabitants, up sharply
from 2.56 in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Of all the 16 German states, Bavaria in western Germany
registered the lowest rate of either violent right or left-wing
attacks, with 0.25 and 0.08 attacks respectively for each 100,
000 people.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, April 8 (Xinhua) -- China's largest commercial center
is establishing a reserve system for land purchases that will try
to both standardize and invigorate real estate assets of
state-owned enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The system includes establishing a land development center

</P>
<P>
The Shanghai Land Development Center, the first of its kind in

the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, which will be used
for light industry, textiles, electronics, and the reorganization
of assets.
</P>
<P>
According to a local source, the Shanghai Land Development

<HEADLINE> Developed Countries not Qualified to Judge Human Rights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, April 8 (Xinhua) -- Developed countries are not
qualified to pass judgement on human rights conditions in
developing countries, Wu Jianmin, Head of the Chinese delegation
to the United Nations Commission on Human Rights, said here today.
</P>
<P>
The human rights records of the developed countries are far
from perfect, Wu said. He was speaking at the 53rd session of the
commission on Item 10 -- violation of human rights and fundamental
freedoms in any part of the world.
</P>
<P>
The majority of these developed countries do not have decent
human rights records in history, he added.
</P>
<P>
During the industrialization process, they had for a long time
violated the human rights of other countries, systematically and
on a large scale.
</P>
<P>
The Western countries engaged in the trade of black slaves for
about four centuries. Its devastating consequences had not been
eradicated yet. Africa remained the poorest continent of the world.
</P>
<P>
The Western countries have the unshirkable responsibility for
the human rights problems the world faces today, he added.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Commission on Human Rights should encourage
cooperation and reject confrontation, Wu said, pointing out that
the Commission on Human Rights is the principle body for the
consideration of human rights issues in the UN system.
</P>
<P>
Confrontation intensifies mutual hostility and leads the
commission astray. Past experience has proved that confrontation
is a blind alley and holds no future for the commission, Wu said.
</P>
<P>
The commission should encourage democracy and oppose the
practice of a few developed countries imposing on others. Many
developed countries have the propensity to make prescriptions for
developing countries, he added.
</P>
<P>
The commission should abide by the principle of equality and
mutual respect and oppose the practice of the big oppressing the
small, the strong bullying the weak. Sovereign equality was the
primary principle laid down in the UN Charter as the cornerstone
of the United Nations, Wu added.

FUZHOU, April 8 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-Premier Qian Qichen

develop its tourism so that it can receive more tourists from Hong
Kong and Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Qian had a look at tourism facilities at Fujian's Nanping,

</P>
<P>
The vice-premier noted that Fujian is rich in tourism
resources, and that with the return of Hong Kong to the motherland
and increasing exchanges across the Taiwan Straits, tourism will
surely grow.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that economic and trade exchanges based on
mutual benefits is in the interest of people on both sides, and
that for that reason postal, air, and shipping services are all
the more important for people on both sides of the Taiwan
Straits.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Vice-Premier Calls For Education Improvement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JINAN, April 8 (Xinhua) -- During a tour of eastern Shandong
Province today, Vice-premier Li Lanqing called for a shift in
China's traditional exam-oriented educational system to one that
places more emphasis on quality.
</P>
<P>
Chinese schools should seek to produce students of high
quality, he said, rather than students who are good at taking
examinations and poor in ability.
</P>
<P>
"This is an issue of more than just educational skills," he
noted during a visit to Zhaoyuan city, which is renowned for its
quality-oriented education. "It's an issue of the guiding policy
of education, and an issue that has a significant bearing on the
future of the country."
</P>
<P>
We should abandon the past practice of regarding academic level
as the only yardstick, and establish a thorough scientific
evaluation system to judge the performance of both teachers and
students, Li said.
</P>
<P>
The vice-premier also called for an improvement in the quality
of teaching staff and a revision of textbooks that is in line with
educational reforms.
</P>
<P>
He also pointed out that illegal tuition fees or charging
excessive fees should be halted and that those who impose them
should be severely penalized.
</P>
<P>
He also pledged that reforms in China's system of higher
education will be increased for more rational and better use of
its educational resources.

<HEADLINE> Nepal to Improve Financial, Monetary Weakness </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, April 8 (Xinhua) -- The Nepali government will
prepare the basis for a sustainable national economy by taking
measures to rectify the weakness of the country's financial and
monetary sectors, Prime Minister Lokendra Bahadur Chand said
today.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a meeting of the Nepal Chamber of Commerce here
today, Chand said that his government has recently adopted a
20-point common policy program for maintaining open and
far-sighted industrial and economic policies in the country.
</P>
<P>
Without elaborating what kinds of new measures to be
introduced, the prime minister said that the coalition government,
which just came to power last month, will make efforts to create a
congenial atmosphere to encourage the private sector's
participation and investment in the industrial and commercial
sectors.
</P>
<P>
Chand on the occasion also asked those from the business
circles to present appropriate suggestions to the government on
the promotion of the country's export.
</P>
<P>
He urged local businessmen to find new export markets while
developing the country's traditional products and seeking new
products for export.
</P>
<P>
Stating that a Nepal-India trade treaty signed last December
has facilitated unrestricted flow of Nepali products to the Indian
Market and Indian investment into Nepal, the prime minister called
on Nepali industrialists and entrepreneurs to take maximum benefit
form the opportunity.

<HEADLINE> UK New Car Sales Down in March </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 8 (Xinhua) -- New car sales in Britain in March
stand at 179,863 units, 0.23 percent lower than last March,
figures published today by the Society of Motor Manufacturers and
Traders (SMMT) show.
</P>
<P>
However, in the first quarter of this year, sales increased by
3.5 percent to 549,534 from 531,049 over the same period in 1996,
with the bulk of the growth in January.
</P>
<P>
The SMMT expressed concern at last month's sales and pointed
out that the slowdown conflicted with surveys showing retail
spending picking up.
</P>
<P>
One possibility was that the buyers were put off by election
uncertainty and the likelihood of higher interest rates whichever
party won next month's election.
</P>
<P>
But the SMMT believed that the industry remained on course to
break through the two million level this year.
</P>
<P>
Private buyers accounted for 43 percent of sales in March and
the first quarter as a whole, the same as last year.
</P>
<P>
The market share of imported cars continued to surge last
month to 65.29 percent, up from 61 percent in March 1996.
</P>
<P>
For the first quarter of this year, imports accounted for 65.4
percent of the market, up from 61.4 percent a year ago.
</P>
<P>
The SMMT said market shares of traditional market leaders,
such as Ford, Vauxhall and the Rover group, all slid in March, to
16.9 percent (from 17.8 percent in the previous March), 13.5
percent (from 15.4 percent) and 10.9 percent (from 12 percent)
respectively.
</P>
<P>
The main beneficiaries were imported European brands, with
Fiat's share jumping to 4.6 percent from 3.6 percent, its best
March since the 1970s, and Citroen's to 5.4 percent from 3.3
percent.

<HEADLINE> Marco Polo's Family Still Has Feelings for China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, April 8 (Xinhua) -- Marco Polo could hardly have
imagined, more than 700 years ago, when he took Chinese noodles
and meat pies back to Italy, that Italian pizza and spaghetti
would be as they now are in the rest of the world.
</P>
<P>
Nor could he imagine that his descendants would have the same
feelings for China that he did, or that a relative 30 generations
later, Siro Polo, would be an expert on Chinese history, culture
and economy.
</P>
<P>
Siro is making his 36th visit to China and is scheduled to
speak on China's economic development at the 32nd World Congress
of the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) scheduled to open
in Shanghai Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Recalling his first visit to China, as a guest of Chairman Mao
Zedong and Premier Zhou Enlai in 1961, Siro told Xinhua that his
family has deep feelings for China and that he still wears a small
gold tag on his wrist watch that was presented by Zhou.
</P>
<P>
On its front are engraved the Chinese characters "double
happiness" and on the back "love".
</P>
<P>
Since his meeting with Mao and Zhou, Siro has visited China a
number of times, and says that he has seen China's reforms,
opening up and economic development, and over the past several
years has become a kind of envoy from Italy to China.
</P>
<P>
When he first visited China, he attended the inauguration of a
museum commemorating Marco Polo and took part in talks on mutual
recognition between Italy and China.
</P>
<P>
In 1971, he participated in activities aimed at restoring
China's legitimate status in the United Nations, resulting in the
Italian government's vote in October favoring restoration.
</P>
<P>
Three years after he was appointed as the European Union's
special envoy to China in 1985, he sponsored the Euro-China
Marketing Network, and in 1989 set up the Center for China and
Asian Studies.
</P>
<P>
He also produced two important works: "Marketing in China" and
"Joint Ventures in China," both of them on Chinese economic
development.
</P>
<P>
As an expert on China, he also tried to look out for China's
interests in the international arena. At an international
conference last year in Italy, he cited facts and data in praise
of China's great achievements in the reform and opening up drive,
and refuted some attacks on China's opening-up policy and
investment environment.
</P>
<P>
He told Xinhua that the Chinese people's wisdom and China's
rich natural resources, as well as the Chinese leaders' policy,
will ensure the continuous development of China's economy.
</P>
<P>
China is in a crucial position in the internationalization of
the world economy, he added.
</P>
<P>
He said that now, in his 60s, he will continue to make an
effort for cultural, political and economic exchanges between
Europe and China.

<HEADLINE> FM: Israel Hopes for Cooperation Atmosphere </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, April 8 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Foreign Minister David
Levy said here today that Israel hopes to find a cooperation
and negotiation atmosphere on the Middle East Peace Process in
the following days.
</P>
<P>
Levy, also deputy prime minister, made the remarks at the
Ankara Esenboga Airport upon his arrival for a two-day official
visit to Turkey.
</P>
<P>
He said that agreements on Middle East peace process should be
implemented and the commitments should be fulfilled,
adding: "Israel chose peace with its own will."
</P>
<P>
"All the sides concerned should extend effort to speed up
peace", Levy added.
</P>
<P>
On the bilateral relations between Turkey and Israel, Levy
said that positive developments have been recorded in
Turkish-Israeli ties in the recent years.
</P>
<P>
He said that he brought friendship messages from Israeli
President Ezer Weizman and Israeli Premier Binyamin Nethanyahu to
Turkish President Suleyman Demirel and Prime Minister Necmettin
Erbakan.
</P>
<P>
He said that there is a potential between Ankara and Tel
Aviv which could be used in all fields, adding that the
agreements signed between the two countries did not have
objectives directed toward a third country.
</P>
<P>
There is a 500-million-dollar annual trade volume between
Turkey and Israel and the two countries are determined to
double this in the following years with the implementation of
the free trade agreement signed by Ankara and Tel Aviv last
December.
</P>
<P>
A military training agreement signed by Turkey and Israel
in February 1996 generated fear in Middle East countries that
Turkey was aligning itself with the Jewish state against Syria
and other Arab nations.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Foreign Ministry Spokesman Omer Akbel said Monday
that during Levy's visit, Turkey and Israel were expected to
sign a memorandum of understanding on land transportation, which
is said to serve as the basis of an agreement on
transportation cooperation in the future.
</P>
<P>
Demirel received Levy this evening, but no statement was
announced, according to Anatolia News Agency.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli foreign minister will meet Erbakan and his
Turkish counterpart Tansu Ciller tonight and will proceed to
Istanbul Wednesday after concluding his contacts in Ankara.

claimed the Palestinians threw stones and a tear gas canister at
them before they opened fire, killing one Palestinian and
critically wounding two others.
</P>
<P>
However, Palestinian witnesses said that the settlers shot the
man with no reasons, and denied that Qassem Arafeh, 24, who was
killed, had tear gas canisters.
</P>
<P>
The shooting sparked additional clashes between Palestinian
protesters and Israeli soldiers, which led to the death of two
other Palestinians, who was shot by Israeli troops.
</P>
<P>
The two Jewish settlers were placed under arrest and quickly
taken out of the area by Israeli troops. Israeli police are
questioning them in order to clarify the circumstances surrounding
the incident.
</P>
<P>
There are also reports of a fourth Palestinian having been
killed but they have not been confirmed by Israeli sources at this
time.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian National Authority (PNA) officials have said over 100
Palestinians injured in the clashes, while Israeli sources have
said several Israeli soldiers were lightly injured by stones and
other objects.
</P>
<P>
Israel Radio reported that Jibril Rajoub, Chief of the
Palestinian Preventive Security, refused to speak with any
senior Israelis officers during the time of the clashes, which
lasted for several hours.
</P>
<P>
However, Israeli army general Uzi Dayan said that the
cooperation between Israeli and Palestinian forces is good,
especially in dealing with rioters at the periphery between
Israel and PNA-controlled areas.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli army has imposed a curfew on the area of Hebron
under Israeli control, and military and police reinforcements
fanned out in the area in an attempt to calm the
situation.

<HEADLINE> Conference on Future Somalia Concluded </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, April 8 (Xinhua) -- The conference by the factions
opposing south Mogadishu faction leader, Hussein Mohamed Aidid,
in Lafweyn hotel of north Mogadishu has been concluded today
after five days of serious debates over Somalia's fate in the
near future.
</P>
<P>
General Adan Abdullahi Nur Gabyow, the current chairman of the
National Salvation Council established in Sodare of Ethiopia has
addressed the conclusion speech.
</P>
<P>
The conference which has its toughest point on how the future
parliament members would be formed for Somalia has concluded with
the proposal of a 151 parliamentarians for the future Somali
government. However, the conference has not yet settled on how
they will be chosen either through regional or tribal lines.
</P>
<P>
The congress has also resolved on the convening of another
meeting by the Sodare group in Mogadishu on May 10 this year
before the other meeting in Bosasso scheduled to take place on
June 10. According to Mr Mohamed Moallim, one of information
secretaries of the conference, the meeting in Mogadishu next
month will solve the minor disputes and prepare for a better
understanding within the factions prior to the Bosasso meeting.
</P>
<P>
The five days long meeting was attended by Somali guests from
Canada and America. The closure ceremony was also attended by
hundreds of guests from the women groups and muslim scholars.
</P>
<P>
The general Adan Abdullahi Gabyow, the chairman of the
congress, has thanked all the people who offered their moral and
material support to the meeting. He also thanked the regional and
international organizations, the neighboring countries and the
Arab League for their support to facilitation in ending Somalia's
crises.
</P>
<P>
The leading figures of Habar Gidir such as Osman Hassan Ali
Atto and colonel Abdullahi Yussuf Ahmed of the Majerten clan from
Bosasso who were Banned to attend the meeting did not show up
during the five days meeting. Political analysts in the capital
suspect that there are new political differences between Ali
Mahdi Mohamed on one side and Osman Ali Atto and colonel
Abdullahi Yussuf on the other. The analysts also predict that the
Bosasso meeting is less likely to take place since Mr Ali Mahdi
is also likely to take his revenge and not attend the Bosasso
meeting as they did on this one in Mogadishu.

<HEADLINE> Africa Seeks More Benefits From Oil: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, April 8 (Xinhua) -- African countries and institutions
are not benefiting from the foreign-dominated oil trade industry
despite the existence of opportunities which could see the
continent making significant financial gains and savings from
this energy sector.
</P>
<P>
Instead, some overseas countries were using the continent's
resources to make a profit out of Africa, a co-ordinator of the
forthcoming African oil trade conference, Clive Mutiso told
reporters here today.
</P>
<P>
The conference opens in Harare on Monday and over 200
delegates from across the world representing decision makers and
customers are expected to attend.
</P>
<P>
The four-day conference is expected to provide details for the
first time of the infrastructure and financial needs created by
national energy strategies.
</P>
<P>
"We are trying to give Africa and its institutions a bigger
share in the profits of the African oil trade," said Mutiso.
</P>
<P>
He said African countries should be able to attract local
investors in the form of reinsurance companies and other
indigenous concerns, departing from relying on the government,
parastatals and multi-nationals.
</P>
<P>
He added the continent also needed to invest in infrastructure
to exploit different kinds of fuel such as liquid petroleum gas.

<HEADLINE> Islamic Jihad Vows to Carry on Suicide Attacks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 8 (Xinhua) -- The fundamentalist organization,
Islamic Jihad, declared today that it will continue to deal with
the "Jewish enemy" with what it called the weapon of martyrdom,
according to a report of JMCC, a Palestinian press service based
in East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The threat of suicide attack was contained in a statement
distributed in the Palestinian territories by the armed wing of
Islamic Jihad.
</P>
<P>
"When the criminal (Binyamin) Netanyahu knows that nobody can
stop his settlements in any spot of what he calls the Land of
Israel," the statement said, "he should know together with the
(Palestinian) Autonomy Authority, our people, our nation and the
entire world that no one can stop or ban us from hitting any
Zionist target whatever it is in any spot of our occupied land."
</P>
<P>
The organization criticized the Palestinian National Authority
(PNA) for what it called collaboration with Israel to crack down
Jihad activities, saying that some 300 of Jihad members in Gaza
had recently been arrested and brutally tortured in prisons.
</P>
<P>
The statement said that the Islamic Jihad demands that the PNA
stop jailing its members.
</P>
<P>
Under heavy pressure from Israel and the U.S., the PNA has
carried out a massive campaign to crack down the fundamentalist
groups, especially Islamic Jihad, in the wake of the recent
suicide bombing attacks in Tel Aviv and the Gaza Strip.

YAOUNDE, April 8 (Xinhua) -- Camerounian Premier Peter Mafany
Musongue left Yaounde today for Congolese capital Brazzaville to
attend the 32nd summit of heads of state of the Economic and
Customs Union of Central Africa (UDEAC), local radio reported.
</P>
<P>
The summit which opened today will lay the ground for the
creation of the Central African Economic and Monetary Community.
</P>
<P>
The creation of the community coincides with brighter economic
perspectives in UDEAC member nations, particularly, the global
economic growth rate of 4.4 percent in the sub-region.
</P>
<P>
The heads of state and government will be working with
procedural document prepared by the ministerial committee of the
bank of central African states which met earlier in Brazzaville
under the chairmenship of Cameroun's Budget Minister Roger
Melingui.
</P>
<P>
The summit is scheduledrly to end on April 10.
</P>
<P>
The UDEAC was created in December of 1964 while leaders from
Congo, Gabon, Cameroun, Chad and Central Africa gathered in
Brazzaville to sign an agreement to form the UDEAC aimed at
promoting the local economic cooperation and pave the way for the
realization of the union's economic integration.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Turkey, Israel Sign Memorandum of Understanding on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, April 8 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Foreign Minister Tansu
Ciller and her Israeli counterpart David Levy signed here this
evening a memorandum of understanding on land transportation,
which is said to serve as the basis of an agreement on broader
transportation cooperation in the future.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the signing ceremony, Ciller said that on the one
hand, Turkey is continuing to develop its relations with Muslim
countries, on the other, Turkey is expanding its ties with
Israel.
</P>
<P>
This was the third accord signed by Turkey and Israel
following a military training agreement and a free trade agreement
inked last year.
</P>
<P>
Ciller, who is also deputy prime minister, expressed her hope
that Turkey and Israel would further develop their cooperation in
the future.
</P>
<P>
For his part, Levy said that there is a very great potential in
cooperation between Turkey and Israel.
</P>
<P>
He said that the two countries should find opportunity for
further cooperative development in every field, especially from
the perspective of research and development.
</P>
<P>
"As two democratic countries, we should do what we want, but
never oppose a third country," Levy added.
</P>
<P>
The signing of the memorandum of understanding came shortly
after the Arab League called on its members to cease the
normalization of their relations with Israel and to renew the
economic boycott of the Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
The military training agreement signed by Turkey and Israel
in February 1996 generated fear in Middle East countries that
Turkey was aligning itself with Israel against Syria and other
Arab countries.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Ankara has also requested the Israeli government
to review its policy on the building of new Jewish settlements in
East Jerusalem, which led to renewed clashes and violence in
Israel and the Palestinian self-rule areas.

PARIS, April 8 (Xinhua) -- Congolese President Pascal Lissouba
today invited Zairian President Mobutu Sese Seko and Zaire's rebel
leader Laurent-Desire Kabila to meet in the Congolese city of
Pointe-Noire to negotiate peace, reported Agence France-Presse.
</P>
<P>
In a speech at a meeting of the central African customs union
in Brazzaville, Lissouba also congratulated the government of
Zaire for agreeing to negotiate with the rebels through the
mediation of South Africa and the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
"In the name of the Congolese people..., I support the
initiatives of President Mobutu to find a solution through
dialogue to the Zaire crisis," he said.
</P>
<P>
While agreeing to take part in the negotiation scheduled for
this week in South Africa, the Zairian rebels are at the gate of
the country's second largest city Lubumbashi and have vowed to go
up to Kinshasa.
</P>
<P>
"This is why the Congo offers voluntarily to Marshal Mobutu and
Mr. Kabila its superb and peaceful city of Pointe-Noire to shelter
these delicate but saving negotiations... which, if they want,
will be placed under the auspices of the Organization of African
Unity and the United Nations," said Lissouba.
</P>
<P>
About 2,000 soldiers from Western countries are now deployed in
the Congo to prepare for the evacuation of thousands of Westerners

LUANDA, April 8 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan
today said he himself and the United Nations will continue to
support the peace process in Angola in an all round way.

<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, April 8 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian Prime Minister Abdul Salam
Majali said here today that King Hussein was recovering quickly
after undergoing a surgery in the United States.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, the king underwent an operation to remove an
enlarged portion of his prostate gland which caused him some
difficulty in urinating, Radio Jordan reported.
</P>
<P>
The king received congratulations from Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat and Egyptian President Mubarak after the surgery,
the radio quoted Majali as saying this evening upon his return
from Washington.
</P>
<P>
During his stay in the U.S., the king met with U.S. President
Bill Clinton and discussed with him means of pushing forward the
Middle East peace process and the efforts to remove the obstacles
in the way of the peace march, said Majali who accompanied the
king during the visit.
</P>
<P>
King Hussein also asked the U.S. to play a more vital role in
the peace process, he added.
</P>
<P>
Hussein underwent the surgery at Mayo Clinic, Rochester,
Minnesota. He has been a regular visitor to the clinic since
August 1992 when he underwent a successful cancer surgery.
</P>
<P>
The king has since returned there for annual checkups and has
been pronounced free of cancer. His last visit there took place on
march 23 when he received a series of routine tests that again
proved that he had no traces of cancer.
</P>
<P>
During the king's current visit to the U.S., he also met some
U.S. government officials and signed an investment agreement with
it.

<HEADLINE> UNHCR, Rwanda Discussing Refugee Reception </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, April 8 (Xinhua) -- UNHCR and the Rwandan government
are negotiating how to receive Rwandan returnees airlifted home
from Kisangani of Zaire.
</P>
<P>
Information from Integrated Regional Information Network for
the Great Lakes (IRIN) said further negotiations are required to
determine if the returnees can be airlifted directly to Kigali in
Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
On April 5, the Alliance of Democratic Forces for the
Liberation of Congo-Zaire (ADFL) responded to a U.N. appeal and
agreed to a plan for the airlift of Rwandan refugees through
Kisangani, the third largest city of Zaire.
</P>
<P>
Four U.N. agencies and the European Union humanitarian office
issued the appeal on April 4 to all sides in the Zairean conflict
urging them to consider the urgent humanitarian needs of hundreds
of thousands of refugees in the war zone.
</P>
<P>
The World Food Program (WFP) told IRIN today that it was
prepared to make three aircraft available to the planned
repatriation effort.
</P>
<P>
Two IL-76 and one c-130 cargo aircraft could be used to
shuttle food from either Uganda or Tanzania to Kisangani and then
return carrying refugees, WFP said, adding that up to 500 people
could be transported in this way every day.
</P>
<P>
The first batch of refugees to be flown out of rebel-held
territory in Zaire's rain forest is likely to be some 600
unaccompanied children, according to UNHCR.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the health situation of most refugees are
in appalling condition after having wandered through the bush for
the past six months, trying to keep ahead of a rebel advance
which started last October.
</P>
<P>
Some 80,000 Rwandan Hutu refugees are stranded south of
Kisangani along the road and railway line to Ubundu, 150
kilometers away.
</P>
<P>
More refugees appeared to be emerging from the forest to join
those already on the roadside as there are about 300,000 Hutu
refugees still suffering in eastern Zaire three years after the
start of the Rwanda genocide.

<HEADLINE> Shuttle Columbia Lands With One Faulty Generator </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 8 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Space shuttle Columbia
returned to Earth this afternoon, ending a disappointed science
mission that was lopped from 16 days to four because of a
defective electric generator.
</P>
<P>
Columbia, the oldest of the NASA shuttle fleet, touched down on
the concrete runway of Kennedy Space Center, Florida, at 2:33 p.m.
as scheduled. Its two-week mission was cut short Sunday by
problems with one of the shuttle's three electricity-producing
fuel cells.
</P>
<P>
NASA officials decided to end the mission early after engineers
noted a slight discrepancy in the voltage from one section of a
fuel cell, which could catch fire or explode.
</P>
<P>
NASA safety rules require a shuttle to head for home as soon as
possible in the event of a fuel cell failure to protect the crew
against the possibility of a second malfunction.
</P>
<P>
Working with the two remaining generators, astronauts turned
off lights and worked by flashlight in their Spacelab research
module in the past two days.
</P>
<P>
"It's for sure you can't cram 16 days of work into four days,
but we are doing our best at it," said one astronaut.
</P>
<P>
Only 10 percent to 15 percent of the objectives of the
Microgravity Science Laboratory were completed during the
shortened mission. But the quality of the data scientists did
receive was expected to be excellent.
</P>
<P>
According to NASA's plan, the next shuttle mission will be
Atlantis' docking with Russian Space Station Mir. Atlantis will be
launched on May 15 to bring urgently needed equipment including
oxygen generators to Mir.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, April 8 (Xinhua) -- The ruling Movement of Popular
Liberation of Angola (MPLA) today endorsed a draft law on the
special status of UNITA leader Jonas Savimbi "for the sake of the
realization of peace and national reconciliation".
</P>
<P>
The remarks was made by Joao Lourenco, the parliamentary
leader of the ruling MPLA, who revealed that a total of 120
members of the National Assembly voted for the draft law, with
six abstaining.
</P>
<P>
The legislation grants the former rebel chief of the national
Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) official
status as opposition leader, paving the way for the creation of a
government of national unity on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Lourenco said that the move by the ruling party has indicated
to all the people of Angola and the world as a whole that it did
not impose any condition to the adoption of the legislation so
that final peace can be achieved in Angola.
</P>
<P>
He urged the UNITA to also take such an attitude to fully
implement the 1994 Lusaka Peace Agreement in favor of the highest
interest of the whole nation.
</P>
<P>
He said he hoped that after the government of national unity
and reconciliation takes office, the UNITA will quicken its pace
to complete its tasks stipulated by the Lusaka accord, including
Savimbi's settling down in capital Luanda.
</P>
<P>
The Angolan people should be united immediately to build a
"new, free, democratic and prosperous Angola", he added.

<HEADLINE> Cease-fire in War-Torn Zaire to Be Hopefully </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, April 8 (Xinhua) -- A cease-fire and inclusive
elections in war-torn Zaire are hopefully in the offing after
warring parties today agreed that the on-going conflict in their
country should be settled peacefully, said a source here today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters in Pretoria, South African Deputy
President Thabo Mbeki said delegations of the Zairean government
and rebel leader Laurent Kabila had already started consulting
principles on the matter.
</P>
<P>
Mbeki, a major peace broker in the Zairean peace talks
currently held at an undisclosed venue in Pretoria, said the two
sides had had useful discussions on the timing and modalities of
the proposed cease-fire during the past four-day's face-to-face
talks.
</P>
<P>
Mbeki read a statement signed by the two parties in which they
agreed on negotiations to bring about a peace solution to the
conflict in the central African country.
</P>
<P>
"This necessitates a complete cessation of hostilities and
other measures consistent with the United Nations/Organization of
African Unity peace plan," said the statement.
</P>
<P>
Both parties also underlined the need for fundamental and
democratic change in Zaire, and agreed on the need for a
transitional process leading to what was called fair elections,
organized and supervised by an independent body.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, leader of the rebel delegation Bizima Karaha
described the past four-day's talks as good, saying more common
points that divergences had emerged.
</P>
<P>
Zairean Foreign Affairs Minister Kamanda wa Kamanda said not
all the country's problems could be solved in one way, adding,
"we are entering a dynamic process and a greater understanding
has come to light."

<P>
LUSAKA, April 8 (Xinhua) -- Zambia is one of 33 African
countries with huge external debt burden, Finance Minister Ronald
Penza said here today.
</P>
<P>
He said the debt burden continues to hinder development and
poverty eradication.
</P>
<P>
Despite African efforts, the stock of debt has continued to
increase, said the Zambian minister.
</P>
<P>
He said that the poverty eradication programs that have been
put in place by various African governments will not bear fruits
if the debt burden is not reduced.
</P>
<P>
Penza urged the donor community to assist African countries in
their efforts to attract foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that poverty eradication in Zambia is a must
if the country is to achieve sustainable development.
</P>
<P>
Zambia's foreign debts stand at seven billion U.S. Dollars
with each and every Zambian shouldering 800 Dollars.

<HEADLINE> EU, Latin America Pledge to Forge Closer Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NOORDWIJK, the Netherlands, April 8 (Xinhua) -- The European
Union and Latin America pledged today to forge closer ties, aiming
at increased trade and planning a first summit next year.
</P>
<P>
"Our relations can and will be better," Foreign Minister Hans
van Mierlo of the Netherlands, the country which holds the EU
presidency, said after a two-day meeting of foreign ministers from
the 15-nation bloc and their counterparts from 12 Latin American
countries in the Dutch town of Noordwijk.
</P>
<P>
Van Mierlo said great progress had been made in strengthening
trade, political and cultural links and talks had developed from
"merely reading out statements to have a lively exchange of
views."
</P>
<P>
EU Officials said a first EU-Latin America summit would
probably be held in the first half of 1998.
</P>
<P>
"The summit should not be simply a symbol, it should be
achieving substantial results," Van Mierlo said.
</P>
<P>
In a joint statement, the ministers said the two sides had
common views on many global issues and "considerable progress" had
been achieved within the framework of the political dialogue
between the two regions.
</P>
<P>
Without having referred specifically to the Helms-Burton Act of
the United States, which aims to punish countries doing business
with Cuba, the ministers condemned in their statement "any
unilateral measure having extraterritorial effect to international
law and to established free trade rules."
</P>
<P>
"Sanctions or certifications... both of these are unilateralism
and they are wrong," said Manuel Marin, European commissioner
responsible for the EU's relations with Latin America.
</P>
<P>
He also said that nations which consume narcotic drugs should
take more responsibility for helping stop their production by
encouraging alternative crops.
</P>
<P>
"Responsibility cannot be reduced to the producers... there is
another responsibility to those countries which consume drugs," he
said.
</P>
<P>
In their statement, the ministers also pledged more cooperation
in fighting international crime.
</P>
<P>
With the siege of the Japanese embassy in Peru by the radical
Tupac Amaru group entering its 113th day today, the ministers said
they "condemn all acts of terrorism, in all its forms and
manifestations."

the Bosnian conglomerate had registered a 133 percent increase in
revenues in 1996.

<HEADLINE> Canada, the U.S. Disagree on Cuba </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 8 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Canadian Prime
Minister Jean Chretien and U.S. President Bill Clinton today
acknowledged that they are still differing on policy towards Cuba.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference after their meeting at the White
House, Clinton admitted that there was "an honest disagreement"
between his country and Canada on how to deal with relations with
Cuba.
</P>
<P>
"Since there hasn't been appreciable change in the Cuban
regime, neither of our policies can claim success," Clinton said,
but adding that the U.S. and Canada share the "same objective."
</P>
<P>
"We disagree about how to pursue it," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Without mentioning Cuba, Chretien also acknowledged the
differences. "I know that he (Clinton) will disagree with me...and
we explain each other, but sometimes our national interests are
not the same," Chretien said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier today, in a welcome ceremony at the White House,
Clinton said Chretien's visit was the occasion to "celebrate one
of history's most remarkable partnerships."
</P>
<P>
Chretien arrived here Monday on his first state visit to
Washington as prime minister.
</P>
<P>
He agreed that relations between the U.S. and Canada "are
healthy and strong, perhaps more than they have ever been."
</P>
<P>
Clinton, still on crutches due to his right leg injury, said
that the U.S.-Canadian relations "have never been closer or more
constructive."
</P>
<P>
"As we stand on the threshold of a new millennium, let us raise
our beacon high," Clinton stated, saying the U.S. -Canadian summit
is "a time to set the beacon jointly."
</P>
<P>
In his remarks, Chretien said, "No relationship can grow or
prosper if it stands still, particularly at a time of rapid
change."
</P>
<P>
"As we move into the 21st century, we must continue to rise to
new challenges and to find more innovative ways of advancing
cooperation, of sharing ideas, and of managing our relations,"
stressed Chretien.
</P>
<P>
Canada has sharply criticized the U.S. policy towards Cuba,
stressing that the U.S. Helms-Burton law which strengthens the
trade and economic embargo against Cuba is a violation of
international norms.
</P>
<P>
The law, which was enacted last year, punishes those foreign
firms which trade with the Cubans.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters today, White House spokesman Michael
McCurry admitted that the two sides have "some political
differences with respect to Helms-Burton."
</P>
<P>
According to Clinton, 250,000 people and nearly one billion
U.S. dollars in trade cross the Canadian-U.S. border each day.
</P>
<P>
The value of two-way merchandise trade between the two has
increased 45 percent since 1993.

<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, April 8 (Xinhua) -- French Prime Minister Alain Juppe
said today that France wishes that Russia and the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization (NATO) could sign before the end of May a
treaty which is aimed at reducing Russian opposition to NATO's
eastward expansion.
</P>
<P>
Juppe made the statement after holding talks this afternoon
with Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeni Primakov, who arrived here
today for a two-day visit.
</P>
<P>
He said that France supports NATO's expansion plan, as long as
it does not threaten to create "in the heart of Europe new lines
of fracture."
</P>
<P>
Juppe also said that France will do its best to help Russia
obtain "access to a certain number of international
institutions" within the European Union.
</P>
<P>
Russia and NATO are now negotiating on a treaty on bilateral
relations, in the hope of reaching an agreement before the NATO
Madrid summit to be held on July 8-9, which will decide on the
eastward expansion program of the trans-Atlantic military
alliance.
</P>
<P>
If the two sides reach an agreement, chiefs of state from NATO
member countries and Russia could meet in Paris at the end of May
to sign the treaty, which will establish a mechanism for
consultation and measures of confidence-building between the two
former enemies during the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
Russia is strongly opposed to NATO's expansion plan which will
take in former members of the Soviet bloc and push the frontier of
the Western military alliance up to the border of Ukraine.
</P>
<P>
Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic are expected to be
absorbed by NATO in the first wave of its expansion in 1999.

<HEADLINE> Turkish PM: Israel Must Abandon New Settlement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, April 8 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Islamist Prime Minister
Necmettin Erbakan said this evening that Israel must abandon its
project of building a new Jewish settlement in Arab East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Erbakan made the remarks while meeting with Israeli Foreign
Minister David Levy, who arrived here this afternoon for a
two-day official visit to Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Erbakan said that Israel must implement the relevant
U.N. resolutions and withdraw immediately from the occupied Arab
lands accordingly.
</P>
<P>
Maintaining Middle East peace is very important not only for
the region, but also for the whole world, Erbakan said, adding
that in order to restore peace, some basic principles must be
observed.
</P>
<P>
Levy, who is also deputy prime minister, said that Israel has
selected the way of peace on its own will.
</P>
<P>
"Peace is a phenomenon to serve the whole region. Israel
implements the Oslo agreement," Levy said. "Direct talks must be
realized, terrorism must be eradicated."
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, Levy conveyed an invitation from Israeli Prime
Minister Binyamin Netanyahu to Erbakan to pay an official visit to
Israel at a proper time.
</P>
<P>
During the signing ceremony of a memorandum of understanding on
land transportation between Turkey and Israel this evening,
Turkish deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Tansu Ciller
said that Turkey is very closely following the deteriorating
relations between Israel and neighboring countries, especially
between Palestinian National Authority President Yasser Arafat and
Netanyahu in the framework of the Peace Process.
</P>
<P>
"We must spend greater efforts in pushing the peace process
forward. There are some difficulties. We will overcome these
difficulties," Levy said at the ceremony.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Levy will proceed to Istanbul, the largest city
in Turkey, after concluding his contacts in Ankara.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Says Chance Exists to Revive Mideast Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 8 (Xinhua) -- President Bill Clinton said on
Tuesday that there still is a decent chance to revive peace talks
between Israel and the Palestinians despite the failure of his
effort to talk Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu into
abandoning housing construction in east Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
"I would not conclude from the fact that I'm giving very
noncommital answers that we cannot get it (the Middle East peace
process) going again. I think there's a fairly decent chance that
we can," Clinton said at a White House joint news conference with
Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien.
</P>
<P>
A Palestinian delegation headed by Hanan Ashrawi, a member of
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat's Cabinet, was to come to
Washington for talks with U.S. officials over the Middle East
crisis, caused by Israel breaking ground in east Jerusalem for the
housing construction.
</P>
<P>
Clinton believed the talks would be another chance for the
reviving peace talks between Israel and the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Chretien, speaking at the joint news conference after his talks
with Clinton, directed his criticism at Israel for the decision to
build the Jewish homes in east Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
"Building new settlements in places that were not contemplated
by pre-existing agreements cannot be supported because there will
be a difficulty to achieve peace," he said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier at a photo session with Chretien, Clinton ruled out
the possibility that the United States would impose high pressure
on both sides to pull them back to the negotiating table,
disrupted by the Israel's settlement decision in east Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
"I want these parties to do what they have to do to get this
process up and going again. We've got to have an atmosphere of
zero tolerance for terror, but we've also got to have the kind
of confidence-guilding necessary to make peace," he said.

<HEADLINE> Refugees Are Vulnerable to AIDS, UN Agency Warns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, April 8 (Xinhua) -- Refugees and displaced
people are more vulnerable to AIDS, a UN agency reported here
today.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations Program on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) said that there
are around 40 million refugees and other displaced people in the
world today. Forced from their original homes by such emergencies
as flood, earthquake, war or civil strife, they are often living
in special camps and some of them have remained displaced for over
20 years.
</P>
<P>
As 75 percent of all refugees and displaced people are women
and children, AIDS threatens most. However, it is often overlooked
in the immediate wake of a disaster because there seem to be more
important things to do.
</P>
<P>
A serious danger for the spread of HIV lies in transfusion of
HIV-infected blood as transfusions are often needed in large
numbers in situations of war, strife and other emergencies.
</P>
<P>
Sexual contact presents another risk in an emergency as many of
them lose their families, regular sexual partners, possessions and
source of income. Moreover, woman refugees risk possible sexual
violence, rape and trafficking.
</P>
<P>
In areas where drug injecting occurred before the emergency, it
is likely to continue in camps, UNAIDS noted.
</P>
<P>
UNAIDS suggested that relief workers follow universal medical
precautions, condoms be made available early in an emergency,
relief agencies provide information on HIV risks and safer sex,
health services be set up after the acute phase of an emergency,
and refugees be protected from violence and abuse.

<P>
WASHINGTON, April 8 (Xinhua) -- FBI Director Louis Freeh
Tuesday said that his agency is trying hard to protect children
from the "dark side" of the Internet, where pedophiles search for
victims.
</P>
<P>
But Freeh and Ernest Allen, president of the National Center
for Missing &AMP; Exploited Children, said law enforcement needs more
money to deal with the problem, which has increased along with the
popularity of the Internet.
</P>
<P>
"It's more of a resource issue for us and other agencies,"
Freeh told the Senate Appropriations subcommittee that oversees
funding of the Justice Department, the parent agency of the FBI.
"I think we have the tools there. I just think we need more
resources."
</P>
<P>
"The dark side of that technology is that criminals or
pedophiles can reach into your home... without many, many
safeguards," Freeh said.
</P>
<P>
Freeh said the FBI was attacking the problem through its
"Crimes Against Children" initiative, which covers sexual
exploitation of children, abductions and violent crimes.

<HEADLINE> Zairian Rebels Enter Lubumbashi as Fighting Rages On </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, April 9 (Xinhua) -- Zaire's rebels entered the country's
"economic lung" Lubumbashi this afternoon while fighting was
raging on between the rebels and the elite Special Presidential
Division of the Zairian army, reported Agence France-Presse (AFP).
</P>
<P>
Kyungu ku Mwanza, governor of the province of Shaba, of which
Lubumbashi is the capital, was seen circulating around the town on
a vehicle with a white flag in his hand by 15:30 (1330 GMT), said
AFP quoting witnesses.
</P>
<P>
Fierce fighting went on today between the rebels and government
troops over the control of the headquarters of the Special
Presidential Division, and the rebels have apparently taken it,
said AFP.
</P>
<P>
The rebels have put the southern part of the city under their
control by the afternoon, while government troops continued to
resist from other parts of the city with heavy weapons.
</P>
<P>
AFP said that many government soldiers were fleeing toward an
airport 10 kilometers north of Shaba, while the rebels were seen
to be moving near the airport in the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
United States presidential spokesman Michael McCurry said today
that Zairian President Mobutu Sese Seko "is on the point of
becoming a creature of history."
</P>
<P>
France today regretted that the peace talks between the rebels
and the government of Zaire in South Africa have failed to fix any
date for a cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
The fall of Lubumbashi will let the rebels control all the
major cities of Zaire, except the capital Kinshasa, and will let
them control most of the mineral resources of the country.
</P>
<P>
Situated 1,500 kilometers southeast of Kinshasa and 30
kilometers from the Zambian border, Lubumbashi is located on the
strategic position linking Zaire with the southern part of the
African continent.
</P>
<P>
Formerly called Elizabethville, Lubumbashi has around 740,000
inhabitants, according to a census made in 1984.
</P>
<P>
About 10 percent of the world's copper reserve and 80 percent
of its cobalt reserve are concentrated in Shaba along an arch
shaped land of 50 kilometers wide and 300 kilometers long
extending from Kolwesi in the northwest to Lubumbashi in the
southeast while passing through the city of Likasi.
</P>
<P>
Zaire's national mineral society Gecamines used to produce
470,000 tons of copper, 14,000 tons of cobalt and 65,000 tons of
zinc each year, earning the bulk of the country's foreign currency
income.
</P>
<P>
With the capture of Lubumbashi, the rebels are controlling the
minerally rich province of Shaba and the diamond-bearing province
of eastern Kasai, whose capital Mbuji-Mayi fell last Friday.
</P>
<P>
The rebels captured Zaire's third largest city Kisangani in
March, and are controlling the water traffic of the Zaire River.

<HEADLINE> 32nd Chamber of Commerce World Congress Opens in Shanghai </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, April 9 (Xinhua) -- The 32nd World Congress of the
International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) opened in Shanghai this
morning, with more than 1,000 participants from 74 countries and
regions.
</P>
<P>
This is China's first ICC congress since the ICC was founded in
1919.
</P>
<P>
The theme is "Asia in Global Economy". Participants will
discuss the global economy, Asian entrepreneurs' views on the
world market, China's increasing role in Asia and the world, the
economic development of Shanghai and Hong Kong, and ICC policies.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Premier Li Peng, speaking at the opening ceremony,
welcomed the participants and wished the meeting success on behalf
of the Chinese government and people.
</P>
<P>
Li said that in today's world, multi-polarization is speeding
up, science and technology are seeing tremendous development, the
world economy is on the rise, international trade and investment
are expanding, economic links among countries are becoming closer,
and regional economic cooperation is increasing.
</P>
<P>
He pointed particularly to accelerating economic growth in some
developing countries, but said that the world is still full of
conflicts and has imbalanced economic development and a growing
gap between the rich and the poor. There are also unfair exchanges
that harm the rights and interests of developing countries, he
said, and there is a common appeal of people all over the world
for a fairer and more rational order in the world economy.
</P>
<P>
Li noted that Asia, which has experienced various hardships,
has many remarkable economic achievements, especially in East
Asia, which has been a leader in world economic growth for quite a
few years, and has been a force for economic growth in the
Asia-Pacific region.
</P>
<P>
The Asian people are striving to bring a peaceful, stable,
prosperous, and progressive Asia to the next century, Li said,
adding that potential for Asian development is great and Asia's
future is bright.
</P>
<P>
After speaking on the great changes resulting from China's
reform and opening up policy, Li said that China is closely tied
to Asia's prosperity and attributed China's achievements to the
reform and opening-up policy.
</P>
<P>
Li said that China will offer a 700-billion-US-dollar market in
the next four years, and that he hopes all far-sighted
entrepreneurs and businessmen will not miss the opportunity to
enter the Chinese market.
</P>
<P>
After Hong Kong's return to the motherland on July 1 this year,
Hong Kong is bound to play a more active role in increasing
economic and trade relations among Asian countries, and between
Asia and the rest of the world, he said.
</P>
<P>
China is ready, on the basis of equality and reciprocity, to
strengthen cooperation and exchanges with Asian countries and
other countries, and to contribute to world peace and development,
he said.
</P>
<P>
This afternoon, Li met with ICC Chairman Helmut Maucher, ICC
officials, and foreign participants.

<HEADLINE> Iraqi Plane Lands in Jeddah Defying UN Sanctions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, April 9 (Xinhua) -- An Iraqi aircraft with 104
pilgrims on board landed today at the airport of Jeddah, Saudi
Arabia, breaking the U.N. ban of flights in and out of Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Two Saudi Arabian warplanes intercepted and escorted the Iraqi
aircraft to Saudi western city of Jeddah and allowed the
passengers to complete necessary entry formalities for performing
Hajj in Mecca.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Interior Minister Prince Nayef Bin Abdel-Aziz was quoted
by Kuwait News Agency as saying that "two Saudi warplanes
intercepted the Iraqi aircraft, entering the Saudi airspace
without advance notice, at 12:00 local time. Realizing that the
aircraft had pilgrims aboard, the warplanes escorted the aircraft
to the airport to end entry formalities."
</P>
<P>
The minister said his country would not refuse any person
arriving for pilgrimage using whatever means of transportation.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations Security Council has imposed several
sanctions on Iraq after the Gulf War including a denial of
permission to any aircraft to take off or land in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
According to the reports, the Iraqi plane took off from Iraq's
Rashid Air Base, which is about 15 kilometers south of the capital
of Baghdad, after holding a departure ceremony at the airport.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia was one of the major allies fighting against Iraq
in the 1990 Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
About two million Muslims are expected to arrive in Saudi
Arabia to perform this year's Hajj. During the Hajj, Muslim
pilgrims will march to Mount Arafat, the site of the Prophet
Mohammad's last sermon 14 centuries ago.
</P>
<P>
Pilgrims have been arriving in the kingdom for weeks. Many
Iraqi pilgrims arrived last Monday by land to Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
Iraq, according to quota, can send up to 20,000 pilgrims every
year while every other Islamic countries was allowed to send up
to 1000 pilgrims for every 1 million citizens.

<P>
OTTAWA, April 9 (Xinhua) -- Canada's auto sales rose 5.1
percent in February to reach 111,377 units, Statistics Canada said
today.
</P>
<P>
February's rise nearly reversed the 5.8 percent decline seen in
January. Early indications of March sales suggest a month-to-month
gain in both cars and trucks.
</P>
<P>
Truck sales remained highly variable. An 8.3 percent jump in
February followed a decline of 11.3 percent in January and an 11.6
percent increase in December.
</P>
<P>
But overall, the major trend in truck sales was upwards, the
federal agency said.
</P>
<P>
Car sales, which have been on the rise since April 1996,
increased 2.4 percent in February.
</P>
<P>
In the month, Canadian consumers spent an average of 18,700
U.S. dollars (before tax) on a motor vehicle, 5.7 percent more
than they spent a year ago, the agency said.

<HEADLINE> German Union Seek Shorter Working Week </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, April 9 (Xinhua) -- Germany's biggest union, IG Metall,
today proposed a shorter working week in a bid to create more jobs
to tackle the country's problem of high unemployment.
</P>
<P>
The union would seek the introduction of a 32-hour, four-day
week in its scheduled pay talks with employers in 1999, said Klaus
Zwickel, head of IG Metall, at a union-sponsored employment summit
in Berlin. The union has about 2.7 million members.
</P>
<P>
He said IG Metall would focus its efforts on this issue in the
next few years.
</P>
<P>
Over the last 40 years, IG Metall has been a leader in the
drive for shorter working hours. It pushed through a 40-hour,
five-day week 30 years ago, and a 35-hour week that began in
October 1995 in the western German metal and engineering
industries, after 20-years of effort.
</P>
<P>
Zwickel made the proposal after official data released on
Tuesday showed that Germany's unemployment remained high at about
4.48 million in March, though 195,000 down from a postwar record
high of 4.67 million in February.
</P>
<P>
The IG Metall chief, in 1995, urged an "Alliance for Jobs"
between unions, employers and the government. It called for low
wage increases in return for jobs creation.
</P>
<P>
However, the alliance broke up last year after unions
criticized the government for its attempts to cut welfare and work
related benefits in a bid to keep public spending within limits
set for joining Europe's single currency, the euro.
</P>
<P>
At the Berlin summit, Zwickel also warned that any delay to the
planned 1999 launch of the euro would lead to a stronger German
mark and subsequently further weakened labor market in Germany.
</P>
<P>
Dieter Schulte, head of the German trade union federation
(DGB), welcomed IG Metall's proposal. He renewed his appeal for
inclusion of social and employment goals in the European Union's
Maastricht treaty.

<HEADLINE> Feature: Love or Hate, No More Free Rides at Great </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, April 9 (Xinhua) -- "It really pays to take a free ride
at the last of the surviving Seven Wonders of the World," sighed
Xia Peng, a Chinese tourist who came to admire the great pyramids
and ended up lamenting his adventure.
</P>
<P>
Xia, dragged onto the horseback by an enthusiastic horse owner
a couple of minutes ago, narrowly escaped a free fall from a
precipice as several animals jostled for space on a narrow pass
leading to the Sphinx.
</P>
<P>
Still reeling from a sound horse bite on the hip, Xia finally
gave in the horse riding and placed a few more pounds into the
man's stretched hands for taking picture with his scrubby camel.
</P>
<P>
However, if tourists like Xia know that their days of free
riding at the Pyramids are numbered, they would rather appreciate
the free-wheeling Egyptian camel and horse drivers that lull them
with a promised joyful ride, then bargain for pay in the hard way.
</P>
<P>
The government recently approved a plan to develop the Giza
plateau south of Cairo aimed at keeping tourist buses, cars and
animals afar from the area.
</P>
<P>
A 10-kilometer "tourist ring road," including parking places, a
cultural and recreational center and a new station for camels,
horses and horse-drawn carts will be built just south of the
pyramids.
</P>
<P>
The stable, equipped with a veterinary clinic, will sit two
kilometers south of the smallest pyramid within two months and
will serve as base for the drivers.
</P>
<P>
Zahi Hawass, Director of the Pyramids Antiquities
Administration, upholds the plan to shoo the drivers away from the
Giza pyramids as part of a clean-up campaign.
</P>
<P>
"The camels and horses are shitting and peeing in the area and
destroying the monuments. They have a golden plate and instead
they shit in it," Hawass said.
</P>
<P>
Hawass said he was determined to rid the pyramids of "sight
pollution" and "create a dignified atmosphere to enjoy them."
</P>
<P>
Even if the fun of riding close to the pyramids will be taken
away, tourists and tourist guides agree reorganization is needed
for the benefit of the Giza plateau.
</P>
<P>
But, the camel and horse drivers are furious at the plans by
the Egyptian authorities and threatened to file a lawsuit to fight
out their right for the ancient profession.
</P>
<P>
At "panorama point," where tourist buses discharge hundreds of
tourists daily for a picture-perfect view of the pyramids, anger
is boiling.
</P>
<P>
"We filed a suit at the administrative court against Hawass a
month ago," according to Sayed Fathi Abdou, one of the 500 camel
and horse drivers about to lose their vintage spot.
</P>
<P>
"First they removed us from the foot of the pyramids to the
`panorama' and now they want to throw us into the desert and kill
our livelihood," he said.
</P>
<P>
"More than 15,000 families live on this business. It will mean
our death," said Ali Salama, who fears competition from unlicensed
drivers riding in from the desert.
</P>
<P>
Billed by some as a nuisance and a stigma on the Egyptian
reputation, the horse and camel drivers, however, are still widely
accepted as part of the site and authentic Oriental culture.
</P>
<P>
Sayed Mohammed Ghanem, who inherited his camel trade from his
father and grandfather, said "The pyramids and the camel cannot be
dissociated."
</P>
<P>
The tourist police chief for the pyramids area, Mohammed Al
Sheikh, dismissed their fears and said the police presence will
ensure everyone an equal opportunity.
</P>
<P>
"There are 4,200 tombs in the area, only 19 of which are open
to the public, and the horses and the camel tread on the unopened
tombs and damage them," he said.
</P>
<P>
Anyway, the surrounding area around the pyramids will become
cleaner and quieter without the animals, though the forthcoming
tourists will lose a chance to experience their adventure as Xia
did.

<P>
SHANGHAI, April 9 (Xinhua) -- The Shanghai branch of the
nation's biggest state-owned commercial bank, the Industrial and
Commercial Bank of China, has helped the local economy by focusing
on industrial giants.
</P>
<P>
More than three quarters of the bank's loans last year, or 11.2
billion yuan, were with large enterprises or enterprise groups in
Shanghai, according to the president of the bank, Shen Ruolei.
</P>
<P>
It also was the sponsor of 26 industrial giants in Shanghai,
providing them with more than six billion yuan in funding for
expansion last year, and keeping a close watch on their management
for greater efficiency.
</P>
<P>
The bank also funneled another 2.87 billion yuan into the
Pudong New Area, which will become an economic force behind
Shanghai's economy.
</P>
<P>
By the end of last year, the bank's assets were above 220
billion yuan, and its 1996 profits rose to a record high of 2.56
billion yuan.

ISLAMABAD, April 9 (Xinhua) -- South Asian countries should
take concrete steps in the next 15 years to reduce the widening
gaps in human development between them and East Asian nations, a
report on human development in South Asia says.
</P>
<P>
The report issued here today by the Human Development Center
says that both regions had similar income levels in the 1960s, but
East Asia now has a nominal per capita income 27 times greater
than South Asia's, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
The report prepares detailed estimates for implementing a
concrete human priority agenda in South Asia over the next 15
years.
</P>
<P>
The agenda includes providing universal primary education,
basic health care, safe drinking water for the entire population,
adequate nutrition for malnourished children, family planning
services to 80 percent of married couples, and credit facilities
for the poorest sections of society.
</P>
<P>
The report estimates that the total cost of such a human
development package would amount to approximately 130 billion U.S.
dollars over the next 15 years.
</P>
<P>
The report also suggests the South Asian countries should
reduce their defense spending and their massive domestic debt.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Farmer Keeps 43-Year Promise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGSHA, April 9 (Xinhua) -- The reason 59-year-old Liu Houqi,
a farmer in central China's Hunan Province, is so different from
his fellow villagers is that he has been a faithful observer of
meteorological phenomena for 43 years.
</P>
<P>
Liu took up weather forecasting in the spring of 1954 when he
was a farmer in Fengwei Village of Liuyang City. The township is
located at the foot of a 1,600-meter-high mountain. Because of its
location, the township was not covered by a weather forecasting
system, and residents often fell victim to the weather's whimsies.
</P>
<P>
Liu, who had only two and a half years of schooling, swore that
he would win out in the struggle with the Heavens. So, he made a
precipitation gauge out of bamboo and fashioned a thermometer. He
bought books and gathered proverbs to enrich his knowledge about
the field.
</P>
<P>
To warn villagers of weather changes, he put up a sign board by
the road and put two flags up on a hill -- a red one meaning
"clear sky," and a green one signifying "rain."
</P>
<P>
In 1964, Liu joined the Communist Party of China and acquired a
make-shift weather station with the help of the county weather
station.
</P>
<P>
Rain or shine, winter and summer, Liu Houqi goes to the weather
station three times a day. As an example of his dedication, one
day, it was not until he had returned home from the station that
he learned that his mother had passed away.
</P>
<P>
In mid-June of 1995, Liu forecast heavy flooding 48 hours in
advance, after a week of observations and analysis. He rushed the
report to the local radio station, asking residents to be
prepared. As a result, no one was killed when the flood, the
biggest in 100 years, hit.
</P>
<P>
In the past 43 years, Liu has made more than 250 correct
weather forecasts, and his degree of accuracy has climbed from an
unimpressive 30 percent to over 80 percent.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 9 (Xinhua) -- China's Ministry of Agriculture
recently issued a directive strictly prohibiting the import of
pigs, cows, and related products from Germany and the Netherlands
to prevent the spread of infectious diseases.
</P>
<P>
According to an official from China's Animal and Plant
Quarantine Administration, hog cholera wreaked havoc in Germany
in January. Some 30,000 pigs were killed as a result, and the
disease is now still spreading in the country.
</P>
<P>
In February, swine fever cases were discovered in the
Netherlands, and there was a report of mad cow disease in the
country in March.
</P>
<P>
To protect China's livestock industry, the state has decided to
ban the import of live pigs, pork and all related products from
Germany. Any such items brought into or shipped to China will be
confiscated and destroyed.
</P>
<P>
The rule is also effective for imported pigs, pork, and related
products from the Netherlands. In addition, cattle, calves, beef,
and related products are also prohibited.
</P>
<P>
All confiscated items must be destroyed under the supervision
of animal and plant quarantine offices, the official said.

</P>
<P>
The team of the Korean Peninsula Energy Development

<P>
The main task of the team is to discuss the implementation of
the agreement between KEDO and the DPRK on providing two

building the reactors.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement signed in 1994, KEDO will build two
1,000-megawatt light-water reactors for the DPRK to replace its
graphite-moderated reactors which could produce materials used for
making nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
The reactors will be build in Sinpo.
</P>
<P>
The expert team comprising 40 South Koreans, three
U.S. delegates, three Japanese and eight KEDO staff will stay in
the DPRK until April 15.
</P>
<P>
During the stay, the experts will survey the infrastructure for
building the reactors.

<HEADLINE> Netherlands Invites OSCE Leaders to Mark Marshall Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, April 9 (Xinhua) -- Dutch Prime Minister Wim Kok has
invited leaders of OSCE countries to commemorate the 50th
anniversary of the Marshall plan, the biweekly Atlantic News
reported today.
</P>
<P>
The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE)
groups all European countries, the United States, Canada and
former republics of the Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
The Marshall Plan, named after George Marshall, then U.S.
secretary of state and later secretary of defense, was intended to
revive Europe from the ashes of World War II.
</P>
<P>
A ceremony will be held in The Hague on May 28.
</P>
<P>
On the same day in The Hague, the half-yearly European
Union-U.S. summit is planned, with the participation of the
current President of the European Council, Wim Kok, President of
the European Commission Jacques Santer and U.S. President Bill
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
The commemoration could also be an occasion to bring together
leaders of the 16 NATO member countries and Russian President
Boris Yeltsin in order to sign, if possible, a document on future
relations between NATO and Russia, NATO sources said.
</P>
<P>
At the end of March, German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel
hinted, after meeting his Russian counterpart, Yevgeny Primakov,
that this document would be signed "at the highest level" and it
would be good to do this "around the 27th, 28th or 29th of May."
</P>
<P>
However, a "true battle" was being waged now over which town
will be chosen for the signing of the agreement.
</P>
<P>
Also waiting in line are Paris, and Denver in the United States.
</P>
<P>
Primakov said today that Paris might be the venue to signing.
</P>
<P>
"If the document is ready, President Yeltsin could come to
Paris to sign this agreement," he told reporters after a meeting
with French President Jacques Chirac.
</P>
<P>
But earlier there was also mention of Denver, where the leaders
of the Group of Seven industrialized nations and President Yeltsin
will meet in June.

<HEADLINE> Egypt expects Visit to Mideast by Albright </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mubarak's political advisor Osama el-Baz made the statement to
reporters, two days after apparently tough White House talks with
Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu have achieved no
immediate breakthrough in restarting the stalled Mideast peace
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, "Washington is currently probing the views of
the Palestinian and Israeli sides," referring to the Monday
meeting between U.S. President Bill Clinton and Netanyahu and the
upcoming visits to Washington by Palestinian senior officials.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat is sending Cabinet Minister
Hanan Ashrawi to meet with Albright and Ross tomorrow to present
his view on the Jewish settlement and Jerusalem, a key to the
solution of the Palestinian-Israeli conflicts.
</P>
<P>
Arafat's deputy Mahmoud Abbas and top Palestinian negotiator
Saeb Erekat will also go to Washington on a follow-up mission
after Netanyahu returned to Israel.
</P>
<P>
Baz said if any progress materializes, Ross will visit the
region next week to meet with Netanyahu, Arafat and leaders in the
Mideast region, particularly Egypt. Albright was scheduled to
visit the region from April 25 to 28.
</P>
<P>
Because of huge differences between the Palestinians and
Israelis, the Clinton administration has failed to bring the two
sides to a face-to-face talks with a new initiative that will
press Netanyahu to stop the building Jewish settlement in East
Jerusalem and urge Arafat to curb Palestinian violence.
</P>
<P>
Israeli-Palestinian peace talks have ceased and violence has
erupted nearly every day since Israel launched construction for a
6,500-home new Jewish housing project in Arab East Jerusalem last
month.

</P>
<P>
According to statistics from China's Ministry of Metallurgical
Industry, China produced 250 million tons of iron ore last
year. The output this year is estimated to be slightly higher.
</P>
<P>
China's steel production last year broke the benchmark of 100
million tons. Local experts estimated that the annual output is to
reach 120 million tons by the end of this century, and 140 million
tons in 2005.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, China's steel consumption growth may average 4.3
percent in the years ahead.
</P>
<P>
Local experts have so far predicted that China in the future
will rely more on imported high-grade iron ore to support the
sustained development of the country's iron and steel industry.
</P>
<P>
Statistics indicate that China began to import a large quantity
of iron ore in the mid-1980s. The import volume of high-grade iron
ore in 1986 was 12 million tons. The figure leapt to 43.87 million
tons last year.

from Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- Egypt has approved the establishment of 28 new
investment projects with a total capital of 135 million Egyptian
pounds (39.7 million U.S. dollars), said the Egyptian Gazette
today.
</P>
<P>
The projects comprised 26 industrial projects in spinning and
weaving, clothes and engineering industries, foodstuff and
furniture and electrical appliances, said Ibrahim Fawzi, chief
of General Investment Authority executive body Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Twelve projects to be located in the less-developed southern
provinces are expected to generate 2,124 new jobs, while another
six in the new communities will provide 1,644 job opportunities, he
added.
</P>
<P>
Egypt, which adopted an investment law in 1989, has bent on
encouraging new projects to create more jobs.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- Egypt has decided to privatize its seed producing
companies on the condition that the state still fully controls
the seed production, a corner stone of the agricultural
production process, the Egyptian Gazette reported today.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian Minister of Agriculture and Land Reclamation Youssef
Wali made the statement Tuesday in a speech at a two-day
symposium on seed production and the privatization of the state
seed companies.
</P>
<P>
Egypt started to liberalize the agricultural sector in the
1980s.
</P>
<P>
ANKARA -- Foreign investment from January to March this year

of investment.
</P>
<P>
The number of foreign firms investing in Turkey has risen to
3,691, with a total capital of 1.73 billion U.S. dollars.

KUWAIT CITY -- A new cable under the Gulf sea waters linking
Kuwait, Bahrain, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) will
start operation in July this year, official sources said today.
</P>
<P>
The 1,350-kilometer-long cable called "Fog" would provide high
technological services in transmitting video, audio and facsimile
signals, in addition to providing data for all computers and
Internet users in the four countries, said the sources from
the Kuwaiti Communication Ministry.
</P>
<P>
The cable was also designed to link with other international
cables like "Flag" which will stretch through the Red Sea and
Arabian Sea to Europe after it comes into operation by the end of
this year.
</P>
<P>
Linking Fog and Flag will connect the Gulf with Japan, China,
Thailand, Malaysia, India, Egypt, Italy, Spain, Britain and other
countries.
</P>
<P>
The sources said the cable was designed to live for up to 25
years, but studies show that it might serve for 50 years without
regular maintenance.
</P>
<P>
The cable runs from Kuwait through Bahrain and Qatar all
the way to the UAE. Saudi Arabia has also requested to join
the cable, the sources said.

<HEADLINE> Northeast China Garment Maker Has High Hopes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 8 (Xinhua) -- The China Dayang Enterprise Group,
one of the largest garment-makers in the country, challenged
popular brand-name products today when it came out with its own
"Dayang Brand".
</P>
<P>
Li Guilian, general manager of the company, held a news
conference here today to promote its garments and fashions, where
he said, "Dayang Group is aiming at world markets by designing and
exporting its own brand of fashions."
</P>
<P>
Li told a gathering of 500 people, which included Vice-Chairman
of NPC Standing Committee Cheng Siyuan, State Councilor Peng
Peiyun and Vice-Chairman of CPPCC National Committee Sun Fulin,
that each year, the group produces nearly 10 million suits,
raincoats, and sportswear outfits, and exports 81 million US
dollars worth of goods to 25 countries and regions.
</P>
<P>
The company has opened dozens of chain-stores in northeast and
north China, and recently a fashion shop run by Dayang and two
foreign firms was set up in Chicago. Dayang also plans to enter
European and Asian markets, she said.
</P>
<P>
There are now more than 30 foreign experts or fashion designers
working for the group, she said, which is also involved in
electronics, chemicals, and real estate.
</P>
<P>
She revealed that the company is expected to be listed on the
domestic stock exchange this year.
</P>
<P>
Bo Xilai, Dalian's mayor, told Xinhua that Dayang is the
largest township-based enterprise in his city, and that the city
government has always helped firms like Dayang that are trying
hard to produce quality goods.
</P>
<P>
In reference to the booming garment industry in the coastal
city, Bo said that, although the clothing industry merely accounts
for a small proportion in the city's industrial production, the
industry has gained nationwide fame thanks to local factories.

<P>
HONG KONG, April 9 (Xinhua) -- Two crime suspects wanted by
Hong Kong police were returned today from south China's Guangdong
Province, a Hong Kong government press release said.
</P>
<P>
They were the first batch of crime suspects returned by
Guangdong this year.
</P>

Yeung Wan-kam and Lam Wing-sing, aged 39 and 29, were involved
in a homicide case which occurred in Wan Chai, on Hong Kong
island, two years ago.
</P>
<P>
The pair had been hiding in Guangdong and were arrested by
police in Zhuhai, Guangdong Province, during a gambling raid in
March this year.

<HEADLINE> India Vows to Keep Nuclear Options Open </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, April 9 (Xinhua) -- India will keep its nuclear
options open until there is total elimination of nuclear weapons
in the world, the Defense Ministry said in an annual report today.
</P>
<P>
Defending India's refusal to sign the Comprehensive Test Ban
Treaty (CTBT), the report said the treaty was neither a measure
for nuclear disarmament nor was it comprehensive.
</P>
<P>
Mere preventive or punitive actions on a selective and ad hoc
basis could not achieve the desired results towards elimination of
nuclear weapons, it said.
</P>
<P>
The CTBT was adopted by the United Nations General Assembly on
September 10, 1996, and was open for signatures later in the
month. But India and several other countries refused to sign it.
</P>
<P>
The ministry report defended New Delhi's decision to develop
its own nuclear capacity and vowed to withstand occasional
international pressures against its missile program.
</P>
<P>
"The indigenous development of missile capability by India is
in response to the evolving security environment in its
region. The countries seeking to impose restraints on India have
also continued their nuclear weapons and missile research
programs," the report said.
</P>
<P>
The proposed Fissile Materials Cut-off Treaty, currently under
negotiation in Geneva, might also perpetuate the supremacy of the
nuclear weapon states unless it was placed in the framework of
universal and comprehensive disarmament, the report said.

<HEADLINE> Dollar Keeps Climbing Against Yen in Tokyo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, April 9 (Xinhua) -- The United States dollar continued
its climb against the Japanese yen in Tokyo today amid a growing
perception among investors that neither Japan nor the United
States will take any immediate action to stem the yen's slide.
</P>
<P>
On the Tokyo exchange market, the dollar was traded at 126.87
yen at midday, its highest level in four-and-a-half years.
</P>
<P>
At 5 p.m., the dollar was changing hands at 126.65-67 yen, up
from 126.09-12 yen at 9 a.m., and from 126.25-35 yen in New York.
</P>
<P>
The yen could slip further in the coming weeks, given the
widening gap between interest rates in Japan and the United States.
</P>
<P>
Japanese rates are at record lows, while the Federal Reserve is
widely expected to bump American interest rates up even higher
next month, analysts say.
</P>
<P>
On Tokyo Stock Exchange, share prices declined sharply under
profit-taking pressure, along with continued weaknesses of
banking, brokerage and constitution issues.
</P>
<P>
The Nikkei average of 225 selected stocks closed at a session
low of 17,703.37, slipping 318.33 points or 1.77 percent from
Tuesday's end.
</P>
<P>
Volume on the first session was about 410 million shares, down
from the previous day's 477.50 million.

The Visa card, to be sold mainly to consumers in Guangdong,
Macao and Hong Kong, will enable card bearers to purchase at 13
million stores around the world, and to draw their money at the
290,000 Visa/Plus automatic teller machines (ATM).

China, includes 231 ha of farmland, 50 ha of fish ponds and 46 ha
of vegetable gardens. Construction of the zone, expected to be
completed next year, will cost 4.6 million yuan. Its annual output
is estimated at 8.5 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
Low cost but high yield is typical of the ecological zone,
which agricultural experts say represents a trend for future
agriculture: sustainable growth.
</P>
<P>
Through comprehensive cultivation and sophisticated
utilization, the farmland in the zone is expected to produce 1.5
tons of grain each year. In the fish ponds, ducks and fish
co-exist and vegetables grow well in the sunny plastic greenhouses.
</P>
<P>
Co-existence, co-reliance and good nutrition are secrets behind
the successful zone, said Li Arong, fertilizer specialist and
research fellow with the Chinese Academy of Sciences.
</P>
<P>
The technology-intensive eco-zone will test all kinds of
advanced farming techniques and pool experts to guide farmers'
production, Li said.

<HEADLINE> HKSAR Chief Executive's Office Seek Suggestions on Ordinances </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, April 9 (Xinhua) -- The Chief Executive's Office of
the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) today issued a
consultation document to solicit public views on proposals to
amend the Societies Ordinance and the Public Order Ordinance.
</P>
<P>
At a press briefing held here this morning, Michael Suen,
secretary for policy coordination at the HKSAR Chief Executive's
Office, urged members of the community to freely express their
views on the suggestions.
</P>
<P>
Suen said that the HKSAR Government is committed to the
continued protection of human rights and personal freedoms as
provided for in the Basic Law and in the international covenants
which are applicable to Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
He said, "However we must also strike a balance between civil
liberties and social stability, personal rights and social
obligations, individual interests and the common good."
</P>
<P>
On February 23 this year, the Standing Committee of the Chinese
National People's Congress (NPC) resolved, under Article 160 of
the Basic Law, that three sections of the Hong Kong Bill of
Rights Ordinance and the major amendments to the Societies
Ordinance (SO) and the Public Order Ordinance (POO) introduced in
1992 and 1995 respectively shall not be adopted as the laws of
the HKSAR.
</P>
<P>
Suen said that the document aims to invite public comments on
proposals to amend the SO and POO to fill the legal vacuum
resulting from the NPC's resolution.
</P>
<P>
He said, "In working out the proposals, we adhere to the
principle that they must be in full compliance with the Basic Law
and consistent with the provisions of the International Covenant
on Civil and Political Rights.
</P>
<P>
He said, "We believe the proposals put forward in the
consultation document have struck a fine balance between
protecting individual rights and freedoms and maintaining the
stability of the community.
</P>
<P>
He said, "We shall be meeting members of the Municipal Councils
and District Boards, as well as major political parties and
interest groups to explain our proposals."
</P>
<P>
The consultation will end on April 30 and draft legislation
will be prepared for the Provisional Legislative Council to
consider in the light of the views expressed during the public
consultation, he said.

<HEADLINE> UNITA Parliament Members Sworn In </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, April 9 (Xinhua) -- Parliament members of the National
Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) were
officially sworn in today at the National Assembly, thus bringing
about the formal formation of the Assembly born through the 1992
elections.
</P>
<P>
During the first multi-party elections in 1992, UNITA
altogether won 70 seats in the parliament. Apart from three who
have so far not arrived in Luanda and one who is ill, all the
rest 66 members took part in today's swearing ceremony. Raising
their right hands high, they pledged to implement the Angolan
Constitution and other laws and work for peace, democracy and
social development.
</P>
<P>
UNITA parliament member Jeronimo Wanga was elected second
vice-speaker of the National Assembly at today's ceremony.
</P>
<P>
After the ceremony, dozens of Angolan children, in their best
holiday costumes and holding white roses and balloons symbolizing
peace, ran into the hall and danced joyous dances to express
their wishes for peace on behalf of all the Angolan children. In
the end, they presented the flowers to the UNITA parliament
members.
</P>
<P>
The current parliament was born through elections in 1992.
But the parliament members failed to take their posts due to
the civil war that broke out once again at the end of that
year. Today's swearing in is an important step in Angola's
peace process and also marked the formation of the National
Assembly.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Sets New Rules for Offshore Financial Center </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, April 9 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia today tabled new
bills in Parliament setting new rules for its first International
Offshore financial Center (IOFC) in Labuan, a Federal Territory
off Sabah, east Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
Both the Labuan Offshore Partnerships Bill 1997 and the bill
for amendments to the Offshore Insurance Act 1990 tabled today
aimed at enabling the further development of Labuan IOFC, the
Malaysian national news agency Bernama said.
</P>
<P>
Under the Labuan Offshore Partnerships Bill 1997, an offshore
limited partnership will be allowed, which shall consist of not
less than two partners and not more than 20 partners.
</P>
<P>
The offshore professional partnership shall not carry on
practice except in one or more of the following fields such as
accounting, actuarial science, engineering, law or such other
fields as may be prescribed by the Labuan Offshore Financial
Services Authority (LOFSA), it provides.
</P>
<P>
The amendments to the Offshore Insurance Act 1990, among other
things, are aimed at reducing the minimum capital requirement to
obtain a licence to carry on an offshore insurance business to
300,000 ringgit (about 120,000 U.S. dollars) from one million
ringgit (about 400,000 dollars).
</P>
<P>
Out of over 1,000 offshore companies established in Labuan, 11
are insurance and insurance-related companies.
</P>
<P>
The offshore insurance industry in Labuan saw significant
progress in 1996 when total assets increased more than three-fold
to 138.2 million dollars from 32.5 million dollars in 1995,
according to official statistics.
</P>
<P>
Labuan was declared as an IOFC of Malaysia's own in October
1990.
</P>
<P>
The moves were in line with efforts by the government to
develop Labuan as a premier IOFC with various financial products
and services.

<HEADLINE> Research Shows Chinese Astronomer First Found Jupiter's Satellite </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 9 (Xinhua) -- Jupiter's moon was sighted for the
first time by a Chinese astronomer about 2,300 years ago,
according to new research findings which dispute the belief that
Italian astronomer Galileo first spotted the satellite with a
telescope in 1609.
</P>
<P>
Findings in an ancient book on astrology show that Gan De, a
noted Chinese astronomer of the Warring States period (475-221
BC), viewed Jupiter with the naked eye and saw one of its 16 moons
in 364 BC.
</P>
<P>
Although Gan De's two astrological books have been lost, a book
from the Tang Dynasty (618-907) contains his description of
Jupiter and its satellite, Xi Zezong, a researcher at the Research
Institute of Natural Scientific History under Chinese Academy of
Sciences (CAS), told Xinhua News Agency.
</P>
<P>
The book quoted Gan De as saying that there was a small
light-red star near "big and bright" Jupiter in the summer sky,
and that they belonged to the same star system.
</P>
<P>
Xi inferred that the star was the planet's moon because of its
color, location and the time it appeared.
</P>
<P>
"It's possible that ancient people could find Jupiter's No.3
satellite if people's eyesight, time and other factors were suited
to such observation," said Xi, who is also an academician of CAS.
</P>
<P>
"Sky-watchers in ancient China should be able to distinguish
small satellites from Jupiter's brightness since they were both
diligent and skilled in star-gazing," he said, adding that the
records in the ancient book were reliable.
</P>
<P>
In order to prove Xi's theory, his research institute has
organized astronomers and amateur star-gazers to observe Jupiter's
satellites with their own eyes.
</P>
<P>
"They not only can see the red satellite, their observation
results were also identical with that which was gained by using
telescopes," Xi said.

<HEADLINE> China Reports Progress in Asset, Capital Check-up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 9 (Xinhua) -- China has made initial progress in
checking the assets and capital of urban collective enterprises,
according to sources at an ongoing national meeting.
</P>
<P>
A pilot program to evaluate the assets and capital of urban
collective enterprises, launched last year, covers 13,000 of the
urban companies including 588 large and medium-sized firms and
2,538 industrial firms.
</P>
<P>
Preliminary statistics show that those enterprises had a total
of 139.3 billion yuan in assets and 112 billion yuan in
liabilities, which translates into an asset-liability ratio of
80.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
The figures also show that China had 495,000 urban collective
enterprises at the end of 1996, including 210,000 commercial and
trade businesses and 146,000 industrial firms.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Youcai, vice minister of finance, said that the
collective sector is an important basis of China's socialist,
public-owned economy.
</P>
<P>
As China deepens reform and accelerates its pace to build a
socialist market economy, the collective sector has become an
inseparable part of the national economy, he said.
</P>
<P>
"The effort to ascertain the asset value and capital stock of
the collective enterprises is a basic task to promote the reform
and development of the collective economy and is a large-scale
comprehensive survey of the national strength," he said.
</P>
<P>
Official data also show that the output and workforce of the
urban collective industry was about a quarter of those of the
whole urban industry in 1995, making it the second largest
economic force next only to the state-owned sector.
</P>
<P>
Zhang said that the pilot program should be expanded to cover
more than ten percent of the collective enterprises in all areas
and sectors, in order to create conditions for a full-scale asset
and capital check-up of urban enterprises next year.

<HEADLINE> Mandatory Jail to Be Imposed in Malaysia for </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, April 9 (Xinhua) -- The Malaysian government will
press the Court for mandatory jail sentence on chief executive
officers of companies convicted of seriously damaging the
environment.
</P>
<P>
The cabinet at its weekly meeting viewed seriously
environmental damage caused by development work and would seek
mandatory jail as a deterrence, Minister of Science, Technology
and Environment Law Hieng Ding said today.
</P>
<P>
"The cabinet has directed the ministry to go for mandatory jail
sentence apart from fines because it feels that fines alone are
not enough as the polluters can afford to pay," he told reporters
here after the weekly cabinet meeting.
</P>
<P>
Under the Environmental Quality Act 1974 which was amended in
1996, serious environmental polluters can be fined up to 100,000
ringgit (about 40,000 U.S. dollars) or sentenced to five years
jail or both. But so far no one has been jailed for causing
environmental damage.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, April 9 (Xinhua) -- The Consultative Document issued
today by the Chief Executive's Office of the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (HKSAR) proposes that societies should be
registered.
</P>
<P>
According to the document, the grounds on which registration
can be refused are restricted to those provided for in Article 22
of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights
(ICCPR).
</P>
<P>
The grounds are national security, public safety, public order,
protection of public health or morals, or protection of the rights
and freedoms of others, it says.
</P>
<P>
In line with the provisions of Article 23 of the Basic Law,
political organizations in Hong Kong are also prohibited from
establishing ties with those in foreign countries, it says.
</P>
<P>
The proposed amendments to the Public Order Ordinance in the
document are related to the holding of public processions.
</P>
<P>
While the present notification system is largely retained, a
public procession can be held only after the Commissioner of
Police receives notice of a procession and issues a Notice of No
Objection to the organizers, the document suggests.
</P>
<P>
In normal circumstances, the notices should reach the
Commissioner at least seven days before the processions are
scheduled to take place, but this deadline may be shortened to 48
hours in exceptional cases.
</P>
<P>
The document says that the grounds for prohibiting the holding
of public processions are limited to those provided for in article
21 of the ICCPR.
</P>
<P>
The document aims to solicit public views on proposals to amend
the Societies Ordinance and the Public Order Ordinance and the
consultations will end on April 30.

<HEADLINE> HK Urged to Create New Share for Technology Firms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, April 9 (Xinhua) -- A study of Hong Kong's
manufacturing industries has recommended creating the T share, a
new type of stock to serve as an inducement for investments in the
development of new and high technology, local media reported
today.
</P>
<P>
Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) researchers
commissioned by the Hong Kong Trade Development Council and the
Industry Department published the study's findings Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Richard Lester, director of the MIT Industrial Performance
Center, said the creation of a new class of shares that will be
tradable in the local stock exchange would go a long way in
encouraging people to invest in technology-based enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The best way to raise capital for new technology industries is
to create T-shares which can easily be traded in the local bourse,
he said.
</P>
<P>
Francis Ho, director-general of industry, said that the idea is
very good, adding that the unwillingness to invest in new
technologies is a major weakness of Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
According to local media's report, many venture investors in
Hong Kong would only invest in well-established industries and
very few investors are interested in companies that produce and
sell products which they have created.
</P>
<P>
The disinterest in firms which produce new products and
technologies will present major obstacles to Hong Kong's
manufacturing industries even as they continue to move across the
HK-Guangdong border.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong Faces Heavy Task in Fighting TB </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, April 9 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong is facing the threat
from the tuberculosis (TB) due to the effect of air pollution and
increasingly crowded conditions, according to medical experts.
</P>
<P>
Medical adviser of Hong Kong Tuberculosis, Chest and Heart
Diseases Association Chan Shiu-lun said worsening air pollution
and overcrowding had made it difficult to prevent the spread of
the disease.
</P>
<P>
He said Hong Kong may have to struggle for more than 20 years
before it can successfully eradicate tuberculosis.
</P>
<P>
The total number of TB cases reported last year was 6,501, down
only 18 percent from the 7,928 in 1976.
</P>
<P>
But, he said, the number of people who died of tuberculosis
last year was 310, down 45 percent from 568 in 1976.
</P>
<P>
A high incidence of tuberculosis was noted among people older
than 50 years old and about two-thirds of people infected with the
disease last year were male.
</P>
<P>
Chan said he hoped the number of tuberculosis cases would drop
an average of five percent annually from this year.
</P>
<P>
He said the best way to speed up the eradication of the disease
was by vaccination and better hygiene education.

<HEADLINE> Iranian FM on Relations With Germany </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, April 9 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar
Velayati said here today that Iran will adopt a wait-and-see
attitude toward its ties with Germany upon the announcement of
the verdict on the Mykonos case by German court.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference here today, Velayati attacked
the German court for using the testimony of some "questionable
characters" such as former Iranian president Abulhassan Banisadr,
who was accused by Tehran of having colluded with Iraq to topple
the Islamic regime.
</P>
<P>
The crisis in the Bonn-Tehran relations came after the German
court accused Iranian leaders, such as Leader of Islamic
Revolution Ali Khamenei and President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani of
issuing the order to kill former leader of Iran's outlawed
Kurdistan Democratic Party Sadeq Sharafkandi and three of his
companies at the Mykonos restaurant in Berlin on September 17,
1992.
</P>
<P>
Velayati said that Banisadr "actually hijacked a plane" from
Iran to France and "cooperated with" Iran's anti-government
organization called Mujahideen Khalp Organization, which is based
inside the Iraqi territory.
</P>
<P>
He said that Banisadr is wanted as a criminal in Iran to face
charges. "How could he be used as a witness," he asked.
</P>
<P>
Velayati said "our reaction would be self-possession and
dignity. The decision of a court that uses a person of the
character of Banisadr and is politicized can not affect us. We
believe in respect and mutuality."
</P>
<P>
"We want Germany to understand that Iran would not allow
other countries to decide for its foreign policy or trample its
honor," the Iranian foreign minister added.
</P>
<P>
"We don't need to have ties with a country that oversteps
over aspirations and principles. We recognize that the German
government is separate from the court. But our objection is to
the other issue," he said.
</P>
<P>
As a retaliation measure, Iranian judicial authorities have
already lodged a law suit against German companies for exporting
chemical weapons to Iraq during the Iraqi-Iranian war from 1980 to
1988.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, April 9 (Xinhua) -- The opposition United National
Independence Party (UNIP) led by former President Kenneth Kaunda has

<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, April 9 (Xinhua) -- Iran claimed here today that five
Iranian nationals were held in Israel including two diplomats,
one cameraman, one driver and one clergyman.
</P>
<P>
Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati said at a press
conference "We will do everything within the framework of our
principles to secure their release."
</P>
<P>
But he said, "There will be no negotiations with Israel on
them."
</P>
<P>
Velayati noted "Our embassy in Beirut has already released a
statement on that case. We have a lot information that they were
kidnaped by the extreme rightists and transferred over to
Israel."
</P>
<P>
An anonymous spokesman for the Iranian Embassy in Beirut said
earlier that there are proofs and evidences that four Iranian
nationals are still alive, who were kidnaped in east Beirut in
1982.
</P>
<P>
On the front pages, the Iranian press published the names and
pictures of the detainees, identified as Taqi Rastegar Moghaddam,

<HEADLINE> China Suspends Loans Backed up by Deposit Receipts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 9 (Xinhua) -- China's central bank has issued a
notice ordering the suspension of loans backed by deposit receipts
and the strengthening of management over term deposits.
</P>
<P>
Loans backed deposit receipts as a mortgage, excluding those to
individuals backed by personal savings of less than 100,000 yuan
(about 12,000 US dollars), will no longer be granted as of April
21, the People's Bank of China said in the notice.
</P>
<P>
The mortgage-backed loans yet to mature will be examined one by
one, the notice said. And the financial institutions will not
issue receipts to the units that deposit money and will instead
issue a certificate to verify that the units have opened a deposit
account, it said.
</P>
<P>
The certificate cannot be used for a mortgage, the notice
pointed out.
</P>
<P>
The central bank reiterated that the receipts designed for
savings deposits must not be used for deposits of the units and
the misused receipts must be withdrawn before May 30. It said that
savings posts are not allowed to accept deposits by units.
</P>
<P>
The commercial banks must not exceed the ceiling imposed by the
central bank of the special receipts used for savings deposits,
the notice said.
</P>
<P>
The PBC will formulate the management rules on the extension of
loans backed by deposit receipts as a mortgage, and the business
can only be resumed afterward, the notice said.

<HEADLINE> Iranian President' Visit to Saudi Arabia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, April 9 (Xinhua) -- Iran said today the timetable
for the visit by President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani to Saudi
Arabia has not been finalized.
</P>
<P>
Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati said at a press
conference here that Rafsanjani was invited to make an official
visit to the Gulf kingdom during his recent meeting with Saudi
Crown Prince Abdullah Ibn Abdul Aziz on the sideline of the
Organization of Islamic Conference (OIC) meeting in Islamabad,
Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
"But when the trip would be materialized is yet to be decided
upon," said the Iranian foreign minister.
</P>
<P>
However, a well-informed source said that Rafsanjani is
expected to make the trip after the Haj ceremonies instead of
April when the holy performance is conducted.
</P>
<P>
The source disclosed that Rafsanjani is now fully occupied.
</P>
<P>
But, some observers here said that Rafsanjani might not
receive an official invitation from King Fahd of Saudi Arabia
because of pressures from the United States.
</P>
<P>
However, Velayati said that Iran's relations with the Gulf
countries are growing. The recent meetings between him and
officials of the Gulf countries show that Iran and the countries
of the region are determined to mend ties, he said.
</P>
<P>
"We are at the beginning of the new chapter for the relations
with them. We have already implemented the first part of the
initiative that they have asked by our trips to Saudi Arabia and
the Persian Gulf states," Velayati said.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian government has launched an active drive to seek
support from heads of state of the Islamic countries for the
OIC summit meeting due in Tehran in December.
</P>
<P>
Velayati made his multi-nation tour in March carrying messages
from Rafsanjani to his counterparts, requesting them to attend the
December OIC meeting.

Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- French Prime Minister Alain Juppe has ordered the
re-examination of the tapping operation launched by an
anti-terrorist group of former President Francois Mitterrand from
1983 to 1986, after the National Commission of Control on
Interceptions of Secrets accused the late president of abusing the
operation for private purposes.
</P>
<P>
-- Italy, which is for the first time asked to show its ability
of commanding a multinational force, is experiencing a political
crisis over the sending of a few thousand soldiers to
Albania. While Prime Minister Romano Prodi said that it would be a
shame if Italy cannot intervene in Albania because of internal
dissension, many Italians are wondering whether the center-left
government can finish its term.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>

Prime Minister Benyamin Netanyahu in Washington Monday, remained

Tuesday, during which three Palestinians were killed and 80

clashes.

<HEADLINE> Uganda Urges Political Exiles to Return </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, April 9 (Xinhua) -- A senior Ugandan official has urged
political exiles abroad to return home and appealed to them to
help restore peace, ''the New Vision'' reported today.
</P>
<P>
Martin Aliker, the State Minister for Foreign Affairs, told a
meeting of Acholi people held last weekend in London that the
Ugandan government will not harm the returning political exiles.
</P>
<P>
Despite some extent of insecurity in the north due to military
conflicts, he encouraged his audience to return to help restore peace
and develop the country.
</P>
<P>
He was responding to the questions in the meeting attended by
nearly 300 delegates including some former ministers.
</P>
<P>
The Ugandan government has cancelled death order to Joseph Kony, the
main leader of the Lord's Resistance Army (LRA), the state minister
revealed earlier.
</P>
<P>
LRA launched a ten-year military rebellion in northern
districts of Kitgum and Gulu where Acholi people live. IRA is one
of the three main rebel groups in Uganda.
</P>
<P>
Martin Aliker contacted with Otti Lagony, one of the main field
commanders of LRA, for peace talks last year, but the peace attempt
was undermined by some Acholi exiles in Britain and other countries,
the state minister said. enditem

<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, April 9 (Xinhua) -- United Nations Secretary-General
Kofi Annan issued a statement Tuesday on the first direct talks
between the Zairean government and the rebels.
</P>
<P>
Annan said in the statement he was glad that the direct talks
on the future of Zaire have established "a positive working
relationship between the two sides as well as an outline for a
transition process to a peaceful and democratic Zaire."
</P>
<P>
"The next step is to reach a ceasefire," Annan said. "I urge
the forces of Zaire's ADFL (Alliance of Democratic Forces for the
Liberation of the Congo) and the government troops to firm up
their stated commitment to a total cessation of hostilities, and I
urge the nations of the region to support this effort."
</P>
<P>
Annan said he hoped that the parties concerned would work
together to "build a peaceful future" and to hold "transparent,
fair and inclusive elections" under a peace plan co-sponsored by
the United Nations and the Organization of African Unity (OAU).

<HEADLINE> Nigeria, Benin to Jointly Curb Cross-Border Crime </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, April 9 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian and Beninoise police have
agreed in principle to work together as part of efforts to curb the
increasing crime rate at their borders, local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
According to the agreement reached on Monday, the two countries
have agreed that securitymen from both sides should be allowed to
pursue criminals attempting to cross the borders.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, securitymen of the country where the criminals have been
driven into should assist in apprehending such criminals.
</P>
<P>
Both Nigeria and Benin are members of the Economic Community of
West African States (ECOWAS). The 16 ECOWAS member nations signed a
protocol years ago on the free movement of persons and goods among
them as a means to boost economic integration in the sub-region.
</P>
<P>
Criminals have since taken advantage of the protocol to traverse
borders for refuge while perpetrating such crimes as car theft,
illicit circulation of fire-arms, armed robbery and illicit
trafficking of drug and art works.
</P>
<P>
With such crimes quickly gaining ground in the member nations,
no country is now safe from the activities, according to
Nigeria's Head of State General Sani Abacha, who is also the
current ECOWAS chairman.

KUWAIT CITY, April 9 (Xinhua) -- A new cable under the Gulf
sea waters linking Kuwait, Bahrain, Qatar and the United Arab
Emirates (UAE) will start operation in July this year, official
sources said today.
</P>
<P>
The 1350-kilometer-long cable called "Fog" would provide high
technological services in transmitting video, audio and facsimile
signals, in addition to providing data for all computers and
Internet users in the four countries, said the sources from
Kuwaiti Communication Ministry.
</P>
<P>
The cable was also designed to link with other international
cables like "Flag" which would stretch through the Red Sea and
Arabian sea to Europe after it comes into operation by the end of
this year.
</P>
<P>
Linking Fog and Flag will connect the Gulf with Japan, China,
Thailand, Malaysia, India, Egypt, Italy, Spain, Britain and other
countries.
</P>
<P>
They said the cable was designed to live for up to 25 years,
but studies show that it might serve for 50 years without regular
maintenance.
</P>
<P>
The cable runs from Kuwait through Bahrain and Qatar all
the way to the UAE. Saudi Arabia has also requested to join
the cable, the sources said.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, April 9 (Xinhua) -- Zambia will not allow Zaire's
former Katangese rebels to use its territory to attack Zairean
government troops, Zambian Foreign Minister Lawrence Shimba has
said.
</P>
<P>
Times of Zambia quoted him as saying here on Tuesday that
Zambia will continue to maintain the policy of non-interference
in internal affairs of other countries, adding that the Zambian
government is only concerned with its own security as it shares a
vast border area with Zaire.
</P>
<P>
"We are neutral and have nothing to do with the Zairean
conflict. Zaireans will handle their internal problems. We are
not going to accommodate any forces in this war. If the Katangese
intend to use our territory they must stop it," said Shimba.
</P>
<P>
Recent reports said the Katangese gendarmes, who had staged
foiled rebel wars in Zaire's southern Shaba Province in the 1970s
and the 1980s, have been regrouped from neighboring Angola and
Zambia to put up another fighting during the current Zairean
crisis.
</P>
<P>
At least 1,200 ex-Katangese soldiers have been sent to Zaire
to join the anti-government forces led by Laurent Kabila, said

<HEADLINE> ICC Experts Support China's Entry Into WTO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, April 9 (Xinhua) -- China should join the World Trade
Organization as a developing country instead of as a developed
country, a number of renowned persons from the international
economic circles said here today.
</P>
<P>
Maria Livanos Cattaui, secretary general of the International
Chamber of Commerce (ICC), told Xinhua at the 32nd ICC global
meeting that though China is still a developing country, it is
growing in many fields and has become advanced in a few economic
areas in the world.
</P>
<P>
It is unfair to require China to join the WTO under the
conditions set for a developed country, international experts at
the meeting said.
</P>
<P>
A senior official from the ASEAN Chamber of Commerce and
Industry (ASEAN-CCI) said that the Association of Southeast Asia
Nations (ASEAN) will always support China's bid to join the WTO.
</P>
<P>
Keeping China out of the WTO has had negative impact on
economic development in Asia and the world, the official said.
</P>
<P>
Cattaui said that ICC, a first-class consultation organ of the
WTO, strongly supports China's bid to join the WTO and will use
its influence in connection with this issue.
</P>
<P>
A representative from the European Union said that the
short-sightedness of some countries that closed China off from the
WTO for political reasons is against the interests of the steady,
long-term development of the world economy.
</P>
<P>
All the experts said they are fully confident that China's bid
to join the WTO will be successful. They are here in Shanghai
to attend the 32nd global meeting of the ICC.
</P>
<P>
"I believe that the prospect is bright for China to joint the
World Trade Organization," Arthur Dunkel, former director-general
of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), said.

<HEADLINE> Top Science Body Releases Report on National Conditions (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The combination of labor resources and technology is an
advantage for China and has great potential, said the report,
adding that the country's weak points are in developing hi-tech
products and resource-consuming products.
</P>
<P>
China can no longer profit much from grain production in the
open international climate and with a shortage of arable land and
water. However, the report pointed out that China shows promise in
producing agro-products other than grain.
</P>
<P>
It said China should make full use of two resources -- land and
water, and two markets -- domestic and international, in addition
to diversified agro-resources and rural labor force to promote a
steady increase in grain production, develop high-value
agro-products and enhance international trade of agricultural
products.
</P>
<P>
One conclusion drawn in the report is that the necessary
solutions to China's agriculture and grain problems are pioneering
a development road that accords with China's national conditions,
modernizing its agriculture while staying in step with the
integration of the world economy, and steady growth in agriculture.
</P>
<P>
The report maintains that bio-engineering projects are the best
way out for China's agriculture, and suggests that investment be
increased for bio-projects and basic research on gene technology
-- especially that which is closely related to grain production.
</P>
<P>
Improved strains of grain have played a special role in
agriculture. The report said that China should rely on everyday
technology to create many new strains in the short term, and use
highly-advanced technology to make breakthroughs in grain
development over the long run.
</P>
<P>
The report suggests that millions of farmers involved in
planting crops, cotton, fruit trees, flowers, and raising pigs and
fowl should be trained nationwide at rural vocational schools or
other training courses. The government should provide them with
small loans so that they can soon become the leading force in
agricultural production and scientific farming.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Ethnic Minority Scientists Contribute to Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HUHHOT, April 9 (Xinhua) -- Ethnic minority scientists in north
China's Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region play an active role in
promoting local economic development.
</P>
<P>
The region now has 107,000 scientists and technicians of ethnic
minorities, accounting for 24 percent of its total, higher than
the ratio of minority people in the region's population, according
to the regional Science and Technology Commission.
</P>
<P>
Xu Gorigan, a 57-year-old Mongolian and president of the
University of Inner Mongolia, is one of the outstanding examples.
His research on techniques of external fertilization in sheep,
goat, and cattle has greatly improved the animal husbandry both in
the region and the rest of China.
</P>
<P>
During his 1982-1984 study in Japan, Xu succeeded in producing
the world's first test-tube goat. He has done over 20 livestock
projects in embryonic implantation. In 1989, he cultivated China's
first flock of test-tube sheep and cattle. This won him a title
for China's top 10 scientific and technological achievements that
year.
</P>
<P>
Xu, also an academician of the Chinese Academy of Engineering
and deputy chairman of Chinese Association for Science and
Technology, is now heading a bioengineering research program on
north China's fine-breed cattle, popularization and
industrialization of which are expected to promote the country's
animal husbandry to a higher level.
</P>
<P>
The autonomous region, inhabited by 50 ethnic groups, had few
ethnic minority scientists and technicians before it was founded
in 1947 and at that time there were no universities or colleges at
all, and 95 percent of the minority population were illiterate. It
now has 19 institutions of higher learning, with 21 minority
college students per 10,000 population, higher than the national
average. More than 700 minority scientists and technicians have
studied abroad, and are making greater contributions to local
economic prosperity.
</P>
<P>
Yan Zhezhu, a Korean agronomist, is another example. He has
created a miracle in growing rice in the Khorcin Desert. The
highest yield reached 7,500 kilograms per ha. The technique is
expected to increase local grain output by over 100,000 kilograms
annually, and has been adopted by UN departments to counteract the
world-wide desertization.

<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, April 9 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Foreign Minister David
Levy has said that his talks with Turkish leaders were "very
friendly and productive."
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a reception given by Israeli Ambassador to Turkey
Zvi Elpeleg Tuesday night, Levy, also deputy prime minister,
said that Israeli-Turkish relations will "go forward with grand
steps and further develop."
</P>
<P>
Levy, who arrived here Tuesday afternoon for a two-day
official visit, held talks with his Turkish counterpart Tansu
Ciller and met with President Suleyman Demirel and Prime Minister
Necmettin Erbakan in the evening.
</P>
<P>
Turkey and Israel Tuesday signed a memorandum of understanding
on land transportation between the two countries, which is
reported to serve as the basis of an agreement on broader
transportation cooperation in the future.
</P>
<P>
This was the third accord signed by Turkey and Israel
following a military training agreement and a free trade accord
which were inked last year.
</P>
<P>
The military training agreement signed by Ankara and Tel Aviv
in February 1996 triggered fear in the Middle East countries
that Turkey was aligning itself with Israel against Arab
countries.
</P>
<P>
Levy will tour Istanbul, the largest city of Turkey,
this morning after his stay in Ankara.

<HEADLINE> Chinese PLA Helps Farmers Shake off Poverty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, April 9 (Xinhua) -- Both officers and men of the
People's Liberation Army have joined in the nationwide drive to
help the country's remaining 58 million to become well-to-do by
the turn of the century.
</P>
<P>
The PLA troops, stationed in the mountainous Enshi Prefecture,
central China's Hubei Province, initiated a successful practice to
aid the needy: one officer leading three militiamen to assist one
household in need.
</P>
<P>
Major Officer Zou Youxiang was moved when he first came to Zhou
Bukun's house in Jianshi county in 1994: a thatched house; two
girls, lean and haggard in rags, greedily looking at the celery
cooked in a pot over a muddy stand; a bench; and a bed with two
quilts for four family members. The whole property was no more
than 150 yuan-worth.
</P>
<P>
When spring came, the family would run out of provisions. Zhou
had to work for others in exchange for some grains, on which they
made a meagre living, together with edible wild herbs. His own
farm work was then held up as a result.
</P>
<P>
The major officer and three militiamen helped build a
stone-wood house, free of charge, for the family, and worked out
farming plans to ensure good harvests. The soldiers also helped
develop courtyard economy, planting thousands of trees around the
house and in the family's private mountain area.
</P>
<P>
The hostess said, smiling, that they produced more than 1,500
kg of grain last year, and for the first time in the past dozens
of years they slaughtered a pig of their own for the traditional
Spring Festival. One-thirtieth ha of tobacco land yielded over 500
yuan-worth last year, which served as pocket money.
</P>
<P>
Local stationed troops organized some 30,000 poverty relief
teams over the past 10 years, and helped 140,000 farmers of 60,000
households like Zhou Bukun to have adequate food, clothing and new
housing.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Students Waiting for Better Jobs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, April 9 (Xinhua) -- Only 10 percent of students who
are expected to graduate from famous universities in Shanghai this
summer have already found jobs. Most students are waiting for
better opportunities.
</P>
<P>
March and April are the traditional months for Chinese
university students to seek jobs, but the atmosphere is different
this year.
</P>
<P>
Educational authorities said that only 300 of the 2,800
graduates from Fudan University have signed contracts with their
employers. The rest are still hesitating between various
opportunities.
</P>
<P>
Experts said that the ratio of the units wanting to employ
college graduates to the graduates is 3.5 to one in Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
"It is now the seller's market," an official explained.
</P>
<P>
Since the country abolished the government-controlled job
assignment system for college graduates in early 1990s, there have
been mixed feelings among the students.
</P>
<P>
Some thought that there would be more job opportunities, some
were anxious about the future. However, as the economy continues
to prosper, the anxiety has been eased.
</P>
<P>
Many experts pointed out that the country is faced with a lack
of high-level expertise, but, at the same time, many unskilled
workers have been laid-off from state factories.
</P>
<P>
Survey shows that most graduates this year wish to work in
small companies, which are one of the most dynamic parts of the
Chinese economy, instead of rushing to big enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Some students are looking for job opportunities in government
departments which can provide them with good medical care and
stable salaries.

<HEADLINE> ROK Insurance Giant to Open Office in Shanghai </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, April 9 (Xinhua) -- Samsung Fire and Marine Insurance
Co. Ltd., is expected to open its Shanghai Office on April 17, according
to Jin-Won You, the company's chief representative in Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
It will be the first insurance firm of the Republic of Korea
(ROK) to open an office of this kind in the Chinese metropolis.
</P>
<P>
Chief Representative You said his company is confident that
China's insurance market has great potentials and that Shanghai is
the most important insurance center in the country.
</P>
<P>
For geographical and historic reasons, ROK businessmen used to
do business mainly in Liaoning Province in the northeast and
Shandong Province in the east, but now more ROK firms have come to
Shanghai and its adjacent provinces and cities owing to the booming
economy in Shanghai, You said.
</P>
<P>
Almost all major ROK firms have opened offices, ROK-solely
owned companies, or set up joint ventures in the vicinity of
Shanghai, and financial companies of ROK have also showed great
interest in the area, he said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the representative office will try to get
acquainted with the local market and laws regarding the insurance
business, and it will prepare for the setting-up of the company's
Shanghai Branch in future.
</P>
<P>
According to You, the ROK insurance giant, founded in 1952, is
one of the oldest in his country, and in April of 1995, the
company opened its Beijing Office, its first office in China.

<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, April 9 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan Information Minister
Johnstone Makau has urged African countries to adopt culturally
friendly democracies to seek a long lasting peace in the
continent.
</P>
<P>
The local newspaper Kenya Times today quoted him as saying on
Tuesday that the recent political upheavals and turmoil facing
African countries have occurred "as a result of the West forcing
their ideas of democracy on us."
</P>
<P>
He stressed, "African countries should reassess their
democracies and agree on culturally friendly political ideologies
as a way of initiating a long lasting peace in the continent."
</P>
<P>
The minister was speaking when he received Algerian
Ambassador to Kenya Sid-Ali Ketrandji, who paid him a courtesy
call.
</P>
<P>
Makau noted that the Western countries have taken advantage of
many problems affecting the African people to enhance their
influence on the continent.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the crisis in eastern Zaire, he accused Western
countries of ignoring peace initiatives taken by African leaders
and only capitalizing on human sufferings brought about by
internal conflicts.
</P>
<P>
The Kenyan official urged African countries to set up trade
blocs to achieve economic independence and avoid over-reliance on
donor aid.
</P>
<P>
He said that Africa should stand to be counted as a continent
capable of running its affairs without outside interference.

<HEADLINE> Top Science Body Releases Report on National Conditions (1) By Huang Yan and Li Xiguang </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 9 (Xinhua) -- The National Conditions Analysis
and Research Group under the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS)
today released the Fifth Report on the National Conditions, which
predicts that China will be able to feed itself in the 21st
century.
</P>
<P>
The 300-page report, which is cautiously optimistic about the
food problem China will face in the 21st century, foresees that
China will be fully capable of providing food for its countrymen
by the middle of the next century and become one of the biggest
exporters of agricultural products in the world.
</P>
<P>
CAS, the Chinese government's top science and technology
advisor, in 1988 issued a warning about the country's grain
problem in its first report on national conditions, saying that
the problem of feeding the country's huge population will be the
top priority of the Chinese government in the coming decades.
</P>
<P>
And Lester Brown, president of the Washington-based Worldwatch
Institute, attracted international attention in the summer of 1994
by bluntly asking the question "Who will feed China?"
</P>
<P>
In the Fifth Report on the National Conditions, titled
"Agriculture and Development," CAS analyzed difficulties and
challenges that would confront China in feeding its people.
</P>
<P>
The report noted that China's grain production would be
seriously affected by high costs and low economic returns.
</P>
<P>
However, grain production is influenced by many favorable
factors, the report pointed out, citing examples of possible
increased financial support for agriculture as a result of rapidly
growing national strength, the advance of agro-science and
technology, increased capacity of agricultural production and
trade, and more market-oriented agriculture.
</P>
<P>
"China can be self-sufficient in the 21st century," the report
claimed, while at the same time emphasizing that the harvests of
last year and the year before were achieved due to the sharp
increase of grain prices which in turn brought more profits for
farmers.
</P>
<P>
"It would be very difficult to raise grain yield in this way in
the future," it noted.
</P>
<P>
Before China's population basically stops growing and the
country realizes industrialization in the mid-21st century, the
report noted,  agriculture will be a crucial and weak link that
restricts the growth of China's national economy for a fairly long
time to come.
</P>
<P>
China will have to deal with shortages of grain, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
"It has become a very challenging task which requires decades
of effort by the government to meet the increasing demand for
grain of over one billion people and help hundreds of millions of
surplus rural laborers find jobs," it said.
</P>
<P>
The report said that in the international market, China has no
advantages over other competitors in grain and oil
crops. Comparatively speaking, China is more competitive in
providing labor-intensive and some technology-intensive
agro-products.
</P>
<P>
"China should make the most of its advantage in rich labor
forces and natural resources and try profit-making agriculture and
intensive farming.
</P>
<P>
"There is a good possibility for China to become a highly
intensive farming country and a big exporter of agro-products in
the world," the report said.
</P>
<P>
The report said that in agriculture, China's status is between
very developed countries and developing countries. This position
allows China to make full use of its rich labor force that
developed countries don't have, and its relatively high technology
that isn't found in the developing countries.

<HEADLINE> Bangladeshi Banks in Dire Straits Following </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, April 9 (Xinhua) -- Bangladeshi commercial banks, both
public and private, that invested in the capital market either in
buying shares or extending loans against securities, are facing
huge losses, said banking circle sources.
</P>
<P>
The sources reckon that different state-owned and private
commercial banks invested around tk 600 million (about 15 million
US dollars) against the securities of various listed companies.
</P>
<P>
In addition to direct investment, the nationalized commercial
banks (NCBs) had also extended huge credit against the securities,
a consolidated figure was not immediately available.
</P>
<P>
The central bank allowed the commercial banks to extend loans
of upto 60 percent of stock prices calculated on a six-month
average market value.
</P>
<P>
Both the operations, direct investment and granting of loans,
took place during the "bull and bubble" period. In the meantime
the capital market crashed. The all share price index shot up to
3,700 in the first week of November 1996 and fell to 1140.65 on
Tuesday last.
</P>
<P>
Due to the market crash, erosion of capital investment of the
commercial banks against the securities has been estimated at
about 60 percent.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the marker prices calculated in granting the
loans no longer exist as such the bank management would not be
able to realize their loan money by encashing the securities.
</P>
<P>
"It has not only created liquidity problems for the banks but
ultimately the volume of nonperforming loans will increase", said
an official of a commercial bank.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 9 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine Trade and Industry

entrepreneurial drive," reported on the primordial importance his
administration is giving to the SMEs during the Fourth Asia
Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Finance Ministers' Meeting

<HEADLINE> D-8 Muslim Summit to be Held in Turkey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, April 9 (Xinhua) -- The Turkey-sponsored D-8 Group,
which consists of eight Muslim countries, is expected to hold
its summit meeting in Turkey in June, the local newspaper Daily
News reported today.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted Turkish Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan as
saying that about 50 cooperative projects would be discussed
during the summit.
</P>
<P>
Erbakan, the enthusiastic initiator of the Muslim bloc, said
that the summit would set some important principles for the
organization in order to expand cooperation among the member
states.
</P>
<P>
He said that the planned projects involved 10 different
fields, such as trade, industry and telecommunications.
</P>
<P>
In accordance with the principle that each state should
coordinate certain fields, Turkey will be responsible for the
coordination of cooperation in the sectors of industry and
health care.
</P>
<P>
Erbakan said that they were only waiting for the approval of
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak to finalize the scheme for the
summit.
</P>
<P>
The D-8 Group consisting of Turkey, Iran, Egypt, Indonesia,
Pakistan, Nigeria, Malaysia and Bangladesh, was first proposed by
the Turkish prime minister and formed late last year.
</P>
<P>
The Muslim bloc, whose aim was to boost the multilateral
cooperation among the eight countries, held its first foreign
ministerial meeting in Turkey in 1996 and decided to establish
the general secretariat in Istanbul, the largest city of Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The establishment of the D-8 Group has incited complaints
from the United States and European countries, which accused
Turkey of putting up a rival show agaisnt the G-7 group of the
developed countries in the West.

<HEADLINE> East China Improves Teachers' Living Condition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, April 9 (Xinhua) -- After crowding in two small rooms
for 20 years with a family of three generations, Geng moved to a
four-room apartment recently.
</P>
<P>
"It costed me 80,000 yuan, and now I can live comfortably,"
said Geng, who is an elementary school teacher in east China's
Jiangsu Province.
</P>
<P>
With the rapid development of the province's housing
construction and the steady growth of teachers' income, more
teachers like Geng have settled their housing problem in the past
few years.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics show that the province has invested some
1.2 billion yuan (about 150 million US dollars) in housing
construction for teachers in the past year, and a total of 2.09
million sq m.-floor-space of housing is under construction.
</P>
<P>
With the completion of 1.34 million sq m.-floor-space of
housing, the average living space of the province's teaching staff
has risen to 10.5 sq m. from 9.3 sq m. in early 1996, figures say,
and the present figure exceeds the province's average city and
town dwellers' living space by nearly two sq m.
</P>
<P>
The province has been increasing its financial support of the
housing construction for teachers, said an official with the
provincial government, adding that it earmarked a record 166
million yuan to the teachers' housing project last year, an
increase of 56 million yuan over 1995.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the province has taken measures to lower the cost of
the housing construction for teachers. Xuzhou City has brought
down the cost to 700 yuan per sq m.-floor space.
</P>
<P>
With the growth of income, teachers also have more money to
invest in housing. Statistics show that teachers contributed 700
million yuan, or 59 percent of the total that the province spent
in the teachers' housing project last year, while schools spent
220 million yuan.

<P>
NEW DELHI, April 9 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Pakistan Foreign
Minister Gohar Ayub Khan today held an informal meeting with his
Indian counterpart I.K. Gujral and both sides decided to continue
the dialogue.
</P>
<P>
Ayub Khan described his meeting with Gujral as "ice-breaking"
and expressed the hope that the Indo-Pak dialogue would continue
in the same spirit. Ayub, who was here to attend the Non-Aligned
Movement (NAM) foreign ministers' conference from April 7-8, later
left here for home.
</P>
<P>
Mr. Gujral said that his meeting with Mr. Ayub was held in a
warm and friendly atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
Foreign secretaries of the two countries resumed their talks
here, stalled since January 1994, from March 28-31 and discussed
all outstanding issues between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Both foreign ministers avoided reference to any particular
issue while answering questions, presumably to emphasize on the
decision to continue the dialogue without long intervals.
</P>
<P>
On April 6, the two foreign ministers had a round of informal
discussions at a dinner hosted by the High Commissioner of
Pakistan for Ayub Khan here. "My government believes in
step-by-step approach" in dealing with the ties of the two
countries, Ayub said on that occasion.
</P>
<P>
On the eve of his breakfast meeting with Gujral, the Pakistan
foreign minister called for closer trade relations with India,
saying that the two countries would benefit economically if the
tension between them eased.
</P>
<P>
Since division in 1947, the two countries have gone to war
three times due to disputes over Kashmir and other issues.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh to Achieve 5.5 Percent GDP Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, April 9 (Xinhua) --- Bangladesh may achieve a 5.5
percent GDP growth targeted for the current fiscal ending this
July as the socio-economic condition appears to have stabilized,
said a report of the central bank.
</P>
<P>
In its annual report, the Bangladesh Bank said that Bangladesh
achieved a domestic product growth of 5.3 percent in 1995-96
fiscal, despite natural calamities, socio-economic unrest and
other non-economic factors.
</P>
<P>
The socio-economic unrest caused disruption in overall
production process, resulting in a slowdown in growth in the
manufacturing sector. Industrial growth dropped to 5.3 from 8.6
percent in the 1994-95 fiscal, said the report.
</P>
<P>
Growth in the construction sector also marked a sharp decline,
the central bank said. The sector grew 4 percent 1995-96 fiscal
against 7 percent the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Growth in the power, gas, water and sanitary sectors dropped to
9.9 percent last year from 11.3 a year back. Cumulative growth in
other sectors also declined.
</P>
<P>
But a positive 3.5 percent growth in the agriculture sector in
1995-96 fiscal, up from a negative 1 percent the previous year,
contributed to the overall GDP growth rate in the year.
</P>
<P>
It is expected that increased dynamism would be infused into
the overall economic activities in 1996-97 fiscal because of
strengthening reform programs and the realistic and pragmatic
policies being followed in economic management, the report said.
</P>
<P>
It forecast that the agriculture growth might exceed 2 percent
and the service sector and industrial output are likely to
increase in the year, helping the country achieve the targeted
growth and keeping inflation at tolerable level.
</P>
<P>
The report, however, suggested that domestic credit and deficit
financing should be kept limited while reducing current
expenditure and mobilizing more domestic resources and attaching
priority to productive and employment-generating projects.
</P>
<P>
It noted that the banks faced a remarkable liquidity crisis due
to the dependence of the government on the banks caused by fall in
foreign assistance and food imports in public sector, and a huge
credit to the private sector.
</P>
<P>
The total domestic credit rose by 20.4 percent in 1995-1996
fiscal compared to 17.6 percent a year back, the report added.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Horticulture Exports Lower Than </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, April 9 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's flower exports have so far
this season registered a 25-percent growth, lower than the predicted
30 percent increase, largely due to a severe European winter, the
Horticultural Promotion Council said yesterday.
</P>
<P>
''Our key marketing period coincided with a cold spell in Europe
that affected not only our customers, but also surface distribution,"
Chief Executive of the Council Stanley Heri said.
</P>
<P>
The second factor was that the volume of cut flowers in Zimbabwe
was down because of the continuous overcast weather, he said
commenting on the industry's export performance between july 1996 and
February 28 this year. The export season ends in June.
</P>
<P>
He said the symptoms from the market place for both flowers and
vegetables indicated severe competition from the African, Caribbean
and Pacific countries.
</P>
<P>
The competition meant Zimbabwe had to concentrate on quality of
both product and service, he said.
</P>
<P>
Last year, horticulture exports earned the country more than 100
million US Dollars. enditem

<TEXT>
<P>
FUZHOU, April 9 (Xinhua) -- A total of 25 abalone farms have
gone into operation on Dongshan Island in east China's Fujian
Province, involving an investment of 60 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
Local authorities are ambitious to turn the island into the
largest abalone production base in the country.
</P>
<P>
According to local authorities' plan, the island will turn out
10,000 tons of abalone annually in 2000, with an estimated output
value of 2.2 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
The island, located at the southern tip of the province, faces
the Taiwan Straits and is a suitable habitat for abalone. Since a
businessman from Taiwan introduced abalone to the island in 1992,
the island has become the largest abalone production base in
Fujian.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the island produced more than 200 tons of abalone
and cultivated 50 million items of abalone, which brought to the
island 200 million yuan in output value.

<HEADLINE> Hotel Industry in Doldrums in Ho Chi Minh City </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, April 9 (Xinhua) -- The hotel industry in Vietnam's Ho
Chi Minh City had hard times in the last two years because the
supply of hotel rooms has exceeded the demand, the Vietnam News
reported today.
</P>
<P>
After years of booming hotel construction, Ho Chi Minh City,
Vietnam's largest commercial hub, has 19,123 hotel rooms,
accounting for 30 percent of the country's total.
</P>
<P>
Foreign tourists to the city however numbered less than 1
million in the whole of 1996.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the occupancy rate has fallen dramatically from 68
percent in 1993 to 40 percent in the late 1996, which had worried
both the state-run hotels and private hotel owners.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the hotel industry still faces challenges from the
foreign-invested joint-venture hotels now under construction.
Seven more such joint ventures totaling 1,760 rooms will be
completed by the end of this year.

developments in the area of nuclear disarmament.
</P>
<P>
"The signing of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) by
more than 140 states, including the five nuclear-weapon states
signed on the first day of its opening for signature on September
24, 1996, is a historic event," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
On the future efforts to support NPT, the five countries
reaffirmed their readiness for the immediate commencement and
early conclusion of the negotiations on the convention banning the
production of fissile material for nuclear weapons or other
nuclear explosive devices.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the establishment of nuclear-weapon-free-zones
enhances global and regional peace and security, the five
countries pledged security assurance to the above-mentioned areas
in line with relevant U.N. Security Council resolutions.
</P>
<P>
The five nuclear powers also said that they are committed to
cooperation in the field of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Scientists Clone Gene of Hereditary Disease </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGSHA, April 9 (Xinhua) -- Scientists at Hunan Medical
University, funded by an American pharmaceutical company, have
cloned a gene that causes hereditary multiple exostosis.
</P>
<P>
It is the first time Chinese scientists succeed in cloning a
gene related to a hereditary disease. Earlier, American scientists
first cloned the gene linked to hereditary exostosis, a spur or
bony outgrowth from a bone or the root of a tooth.
</P>
<P>
A research group, led by Professor Deng Hanxiang, head of a
state key laboratory of medical genetics at the university and
Professor Xia Jiahui, director of the Academic Committee, cloned
the gene, EXT2, last August, after six years of efforts.
</P>
<P>
Backed by China's Public Health Ministry, Smithkline Beecham
Co. of the United States, one of the four largest pharmaceutical
companies in the world, began to fund the laboratory in February,
1996. The company provided 2.36 million US dollars to the lab for
the first stage of research, which focused on human gene studies.
</P>
<P>
Scientists across the world began the studies of human gene
cloning in the early 1980s, duplicating a gene and interpreting
its codes.
</P>
<P>
Scientists say there are about 50,000 to 100,000 different
human genes. Among more than 3,000 human genes that cause
hereditary diseases, over 260 have been cloned by the scientists
around the world.

DHAKA, April 9 (Xinhua) -- The Supreme Court of Bangladesh has
granted the stay of the judgment for six weeks delivered by the
High Court regarding the detention of four opposition leaders,
local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
The division granted the stay of the judgment in connection

<HEADLINE> Romania Lowers Tariffs on Farm Imports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, April 8 (Xinhua) -- The Romanian government has
decided to lower tariffs on farm imports as part of the country's
efforts to join the European Union (EU).
</P>
<P>
The decision, made on Monday, would bring down the tariffs to
meet EU standards, said Florea Tuiu, a director with the official
Rompress news agency's economic desk, today.
</P>
<P>
With a 60 percent ceiling on all foreign farm produce except
alcohol, beverage, tobacco and cigarette, the revised import
tariffs will average no more than 27 percent.
</P>
<P>
Specifically, under the new system, the tariff on imported pork
will drop from 263 to 50 percent, and that on chicken meat will
also go down from 143 to between 50 and 60 percent.
</P>
<P>
However, some critics here have been against the move, alleging
that the lower tariffs may harm Romania's agricultural sector as
they allow foreign goods to flock into the domestic market.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, the Romanian government early this
month deregulated the prices for wheat, pork, chicken meat and
milk by eliminating subsidies for these farm produce.

<HEADLINE> NZ Economy Expected to Grow Faster in Coming Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, April 9 (Xinhua) -- Economic growth in New Zealand
is expected to be around 3 percent a year during the next three
years, with the government spending the dynamo in the coming two
years, the National Bank forecasts.
</P>
<P>
The bank's predictions for April issued today, suggest the
economy is past the trough in the present business cycle. The
combination of high interest rates and a high NZ dollar slowed the
economy in the second half of 1996, with exporters bearing the
brunt.
</P>
<P>
But the recovery in the coming year could be an "unhappy" one,
the bank says. Production will still grow, but job growth will
slow, the jobless rate will rise and the export sector will
struggle.
</P>
<P>
The current account deficit, the difference between what New
Zealand earns and spends overseas, will grow toward 6 percent of
the gross domestic product, the bank forecasts.

WELLINGTON, April 9 (Xinhua) -- Manufactured exports returned
to growth in the December quarter last year after 15 months of
weakening, making up for slower domestic sales, the New Zealand
Press Association reported.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted a Westpac Trust's analysis of manufacturing
industries as saying manufactured exports grew 0.4 percent during
the December period, up from minus 2.8 percent and minus 2.3
percent in the preceding quarters.
</P>
<P>
"While this is a very slow rate of growth, export volumes for
the December quarter moved above those for the previous peak in
the June 1995 quarter for the first time."
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, domestic sales growth was down to 0.9
percent in the December quarter, from 1.2 percent in the previous
quarter.
</P>
<P>
The strong NZ dollar and tariff reduction hit knitting mills,
clothing, leather, footwear and motor vehicle assembly. Export
markets remain weak for fish and pulp and paper, the report said.

<HEADLINE> Hashimoto, Cohen Agree on Reducing Okinawa Burden </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, April 9 (Xinhua) -- Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro
Hashimoto and visiting U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen agreed
today to help reduce Okinawa's heavy burden arising from the
U.S. military presence in Japan.
</P>
<P>
They reached the agreement during an hour-long breakfast
meeting at the Japanese prime minister's official residence, Kyodo
News Service quoted a senior foreign ministry official as saying.
</P>
<P>
However, the two leaders failed to come up with new specific
measures to alleviate the burden on Okinawa. They only reaffirmed
that the two countries planned to streamline U.S. military
facilities and return to local landowners some space in Okinawa
occupied by the U.S. facilities under a bilateral agreement
reached last year.
</P>
<P>
Cohen reiterated that the United States will maintain its
current 100,000-strong troops in the Asia-Pacific region, and it
will consult with Japan over any military action if major changes
occur in the future.
</P>
<P>
Hashimoto told Cohen that Japan will not seek to reduce the
bulk of U.S. troops for the time being.
</P>
<P>
The United States currently maintains a 100,000-strong force in
forward deployment in East Asia, including 47,000 in Japan, of
which, about 27,000 are stationed in Okinawa, the country's
southernmost island prefecture.
</P>
<P>
Okinawa, which accounts for less than one percent of Japan's
total land area, is also home to some 75 percent of all land used
by the U.S. military in the country.
</P>
<P>
The Okinawa prefectural government and local residents have
opposed the U.S. military presence there, calling for withdrawal
of U.S. troops from the prefecture by 2015.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Hashimoto and Cohen also reached an
agreement that the two countries will issue an interim report
reviewing the 1978 Guidelines for Japan-U.S. defense cooperation
sometime after mid-May, foreign ministry officials said.
</P>
<P>
Cohen will leave for South Korea this afternoon.

<HEADLINE> Ousted Police Chief in Nepal Challenges His Transfer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, April 9 (Xinhua) -- An ousted police chief in Nepal
has submitted a petition to the Supreme Court against the
government's decision to remove him from the post of Inspector
General of Police (IGP) last week, the local press said today.
</P>
<P>
Ex-IGP Ackyut Krishna Kharel said Tuesday after registering his
petition in the Court that he wanted to seek justice and the
dignity of the police through his move.
</P>
<P>
The government, which came to power in early March, decided
last week to transfer Kharel from the job of police chief to the
head of the National Investigation Department and appoint one of
his assistants as IGP.
</P>
<P>
Kharel reportedly claimed in his petition that the government
had no legal authority to make such a transfer.
</P>
<P>
Kharel's petition also demanded the Court to issue an interim
order directing the defendants including the cabinet, the home
minister and the newly appointed IGP not to prevent him carrying
out his duties as the IGP until the case is settled.
</P>
<P>
The Court's hearing on the case is expected to begin from
today.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, April 8 (Xinhua) -- Belarus President Alexander
Lukashenko said in Minsk today that NATO's expansion towards
central and eastern European countries is a historic mistake.
</P>
<P>
Lukashenko made the statement at an international symposium,
which centered on building a nuclear-free zone in central and
eastern Europe.
</P>
<P>
Lukashenko said it was strange that Western countries welcomed
the withdrawal of nuclear weapons from Belarus on the one hand
while stalling on the issue of building nuclear-free zones.
</P>
<P>
A security mechanism dominated by a few countries won't work in
the long run, Lukashenko added.
</P>
<P>
The Belarus president first proposed the establishment of a
nuclear-free zone in central and eastern Europe on July 3 last year.
</P>
<P>
He said in his speech today that there was no reason to hinder
the building of such a zone in Europe.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov said at
the same workshop that an international agreement should be signed
in order to build a nuclear-free zone in central Europe.

He said that Russia and Ukraine support the Belarus
initiative on the establishment of a nuclear-free zone.

<HEADLINE> Italy, Russia Say NATO-Russia Accord Important for Europe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, April 8 (Xinhua) -- The accord between the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization (NATO) and Russia is important to the
architecture of future European security, Italian Foreign Minister
Lamberto Dini and visiting Russian First Deputy Foreign Minister
Alexander Avdeyev said today.
</P>
<P>
Dini and Avdeyev hoped that the accord could be made before the
NATO summit in Madrid this July.
</P>
<P>
Russia, though still strongly opposed to NATO's eastward
expansion, dropped the demand at the Russia-U.S. Helsinki summit
that a NATO-Russia document governing the two sides' future
relationship be a legally binding one.
</P>
<P>
Russian President Boris Yeltsin and his U.S. counterpart Bill
Clinton, who agreed on the principle of the accord, may sign it in
Paris as early as May 5, Itar-Tass news agency reported last
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Dini and Avdeyev also expressed interest in deepening dialogues
between Rome and Moscow and announced the meeting of a joint
economic committee in Moscow on May 23.
</P>
<P>
The two ministers also said that Russian Foreign Minister
Yevgeny Primakov will visit Rome in the next few weeks, while
President Yeltsin is planning a visit to Italy this fall.

<HEADLINE> Italy Backs Poland's Bid to Join NATO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, April 8 (Xinhua) -- Italy reiterated today its support
for Poland's bid to join the North Atlantic Treaty Organization
(NATO) after two days of talks cleared a misunderstanding between
Rome and Warsaw.
</P>
<P>
The Poles reacted negatively after Italian Foreign Minister
Lamberto Dini said in his visit to Moscow in February that NATO
enlargement must take place with Russia's consensus and "not
against its will."
</P>
<P>
Visiting Polish President Aleksander Kwasniewski said
misunderstanding about Italy's views on Poland's bid for NATO had
been cleared up after his talks with Italian Prime Minister Romano
Prodi.
</P>
<P>
"Prodi's words, both today in Rome as well as in Warsaw, were
clear and unequivocal and leave no doubt of Italy's backing for
our entry in NATO and in the European Union," said the president.
</P>
<P>
Confirming Kwasniewski's remarks, Prodi said he was convinced
there would be no Russian veto on Poland's campaign to join NATO.
</P>
<P>
Russia, though still opposed to NATO's eastward expansion to
accept some of its former bloc allies, at the Helsinki summit
dropped demands for a deal mapping out relations with NATO be
legally binding.
</P>
<P>
Moscow has also agreed that an agreement with the military
alliance will be concluded before the NATO Madrid summit in July,
when the alliance is expected to announce who -- most likely
Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic -- will be invited.
</P>
<P>
In a subtle signal of some possible leftovers from the recent
tension between Warsaw and Rome, Kwasniewski said "the hesitant
Italian politicians who go to Moscow should make a stop in Warsaw
to see the results Poland has obtained."
</P>
<P>
"It is not that Italians are hesitant," Prodi replied, "We are
talking about give and take and in any case the government's
position is consistent."

<HEADLINE> Brazil to Increase Paper Production in 10 Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRASILIA, April 8 (Xinhua) -- Brazil will invest 13 billion
U.S. dollars in its paper sector in 10 years in a bid to meet the
growing domestic demand and increase paper export.
</P>
<P>
This was disclosed here today by Osmar Elias Zogbi, president
of the Brazilian Association of Pulp and Paper Manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a session of the International Conference of the
Pulp and Paper Industry being held in Rio de Janeiro, Zogbi said
that Brazil's domestic paper consumption will increase by five
percent by the year 2000 and by six percent between 2001 and 2005.
</P>
<P>
Brazil, one of the main producers of pulp and paper in the
world, earns two billion dollars a year through its paper export.
And the paper sector itself is able to earn more than seven
billion dollars a year.
</P>
<P>
If its paper manufacturing capacity remained at the current
level, Brazil would turn into a paper importer, Zogbi warned.
</P>
<P>
He stressed the need to allocate more funds to the paper sector
and to introduce an appropriate policy which would sharpen the
competitive edge of Brazil's paper sector in world markets.

HANGZHOU, April 9 (Xinhua) -- Over 27,800 overseas tourists
visited coastal Zhejiang Province in January, 20 percent more than
the first month of 1996.
</P>
<P>
That month, the province, famous for the West Lake in Hangzhou
and historical sites such as Shaoxing and Ningbo, received 466,900
Chinese travelers, a jump of 98 percent.
</P>
<P>
Provincial authorities estimate visits by overseas and
domestic tourists will grow by seven and four percent respectively
this year. Tourism earnings from both overseas and domestic
sources are expected to increase eight percent.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, Zhejiang in east China played host to 729,000 overseas
tourists and 37.73 million domestic tourists, up 8.4 percent and
5.1 percent respectively from the previous year.
</P>
<P>
The province last year earned 292 million US dollars from

<HEADLINE> Methane Gas Replaces Wood in Rural Yunnan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 9 (Xinhua)-- Methane gas is replacing wood as a
major energy source in Lijiang Naxi Autonomous County, of
southwestern China's Yunnan Province, "China Daily" reported today.
</P>
<P>
The methane is derived from decayed animal and human excrement
that was piped from latrines and pigsties into the special pits.
</P>
<P>
Plastic pipelines then bring the methane gas from the pits to
local houses.
</P>
<P>
"One third of Lijiang's people will use methane gas pits by the
end of 2000, when 5,000 pits will be operating," according to Mu
Zuoyi, deputy secretary of the Communist Party Committee of the
Lijiang Agriculture Bureau.
</P>
<P>
The county government will offer 200 yuan (24 US dollars) to
subsidize each family for the installation, Mu said.
</P>
<P>
It will help significantly to protect the environment and the
forests, said Zhang Yunping, deputy head of the county.
</P>
<P>
Nearly all the households in the county have upgraded their
stoves to burn less firewood. The government has spent several
million yuan on the project.
</P>
<P>
As a side benefit, sanitation in toilets and pigsties has been
dramatically improved.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, April 9 (Xinhua) -- Anshan, known as a "capital of
iron and steel", has sprung up as a new tourist city drawing
overseas investors and tourists.
</P>
<P>
An industrial base built in the early 1950s, Anshan in
northeast China's Liaoning Province made important contributions
to the country's economic construction, but tapping the rich
tourism resources has been made possible only in recent years.
</P>
<P>
Between 1991 and 1995, the city earmarked about 1.2 billion
yuan (144.5 million US dollars) for tourism development, twenty
times the total spent during the previous decade.
</P>
<P>
The investment has resulted in the construction of five scenic
areas, 21 hotels catering to overseas tourists, 100 holiday
resorts, and ten travel agencies.
</P>
<P>
Over 30 million yuan of the investment was put into building or
renovating the city's "trump card" tourist spots, including the
"Tang Emperor Hot Spring" -- the site where Emperor Taizong of
the Tang Dynasty (608-907) took baths; the "Longquan Villa" of
Zhang Zuolin, a north China warlord and father of General Zhang
Xueliang; and "Longgong Hot Spring" of Pu Yi, last emperor of the
Qing Dynasty (1644-1911).

<HEADLINE> Strong Dollar Sends Baht to 7 And Half Years' Low </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, April 9 (Xinhua) -- The Bank of Thailand said today
that the sharp drop of the Thai baht against the U.S. dollar was
due to the strength of the dollar rather than any weakness in the
Thai economy.
</P>
<P>
The baht on Tuesday fell to its lowest level against the U.S.
dollar in seven and a half years, dropping 12 satang from Friday,
the last trading day (with Monday being a public holiday and the
foreign exchange market closed), to the 26.06 baht, the biggest
single-day change on record.
</P>
<P>
Trading was light in a range of 26.092 to 26.095, slightly
above the bandwidth of the 26.06 baht official midrate, which was
the lowest since September 13, 1989.
</P>
<P>
Tanasak Chantarovas, deputy director of the central bank's
banking department, said the depreciation of the baht against the
dollar is merely a consequence of the dollar appreciating against
the Japanese yen and the Deutschmark in the global market.
</P>
<P>
Tanasak said the central bank believes the current round of
dollar appreciation is temporary and that the bank will keep the
interbank rate high to deter speculators.
</P>
<P>
However, analysts and some government officials have been
calling for the central bank to change the makeup of its basket of
currencies. They say heavier weighting of the yen and the
Deutschmark would lessen dependence on high domestic interest
rates to defend the baht when the dollar climbs.
</P>
<P>
The Bank of Thailand said the rate had been set based on its
standard basket of currencies, in which the U.S. dollar is
believed to account for at least 80 percent of the basket.
</P>
<P>
Currency dealers say they expect movement in the
foreign-exchange market to be quieter than in February, when
devaluation rumors were flying.
</P>
<P>
Investors now appear to have been persuaded by repeated Bank of
Thailand declarations that the baht would not be devalued in the
near term.
</P>
<P>
They say the major factor driving the dollar up against the yen
was a statement by U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin that
Washington would not use foreign-exchange mechanisms as a tool in
managing international trade.

<HEADLINE> Italian Senate Approves Government Motion on Albania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, April 8 (Xinhua) -- The Italian Senate passed today a
government resolution to send Italian soldiers with an
international force to crisis-ridden Albania.
</P>
<P>
The motion was approved with a vote of 154 in favor, 119
opposed and three abstaining.
</P>
<P>
But the government is expected to face on Wednesday a tougher
test in the Chambers of Deputies, or the lower house of
parliament, where it lacks a majority without the backing of far
left Communist Refoundation.
</P>
<P>
Motions on Albania put forward by the center-right, the
Northern League, and Communist Refoundation were all voted down.
</P>
<P>
The Senate also vetoed, by a show of hands vote, a center-right
motion concerning funding for the mission to Albania, where the
failure of get-rich-quick investment schemes prompted widespread
violence and unrest in the past month.
</P>
<P>
Italy, the destination for about 13,000 Albanian refugees
fleeing from the crisis, would lead for the first time such an
international military mission since World War II.
</P>
<P>
It is expected to contribute 2,500 troops to the United
Nations-approved mission, together with 1,000 from France, 700
from Greece, 500 from Turkey, 400 from Romania and 300 from Spain.
</P>
<P>
Denmark and Austria are also reportedly considering joining the
multinational force to be deployed later this week to protect aid
transportation to the tiny Balkan nation.

<HEADLINE> Thai Financial Sector's Creditworthiness Still at </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, April 9 (Xinhua) -- The creditworthiness of Thai
financial institutions could come under further downward pressure,
according to the Rating Agency Standard and Poor's.
</P>
<P>
The sharp slowdown in the Thai economy since last year has
brought to the fore the pitfalls of excessive bank lending,
particularly to the property market.
</P>
<P>
In mid-March, Standard and Poor's affirmed Thailand's "A"
long-term and "A-1" short-term foreign currency ratings. The
outlook on the long-term rating remains stable.
</P>
<P>
But at the same time, the agency downgraded Thai Farmers' Bank
Plc and Siam Commercial Bank Plc, affirmed the ratings of Bangkok
Bank Plc and Bank of Asia Plc, and placed two others on its
"creditwatch" with negative implications: Bank of Ayudhya Plc and
Industrial Finance Corporation of Thailand.
</P>
<P>
The rating outlooks for Thai Farmers, Siam Commercial, Bangkok
Bank and Bank of Asia were revised to negative.
</P>
<P>
Standard and Poor's said in its edition of credit week,
released today, that tight monetary policies and the property
slump, combined with lax regulations, declining margins and rising
corporate and household debt, have weakened loan portfolios and
along with them, the average credit quality of the financial
sector.
</P>
<P>
It said the government's commitment to a stable baht exchange
rate means interest rates are likely to remain high throughout
1997.
</P>
<P>
In addition, general operating conditions will remain
difficult. As a result, the extent of financial sector stress is
expected to be more significant and prolonged than currently
foreseen by the regulators and financial institutions. But it is
unlikely to reach crisis proportions, said the agency.

<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, April 8 (Xinhua) -- Retail sales in Italy rose by 4.6
percent in 1996 despite a one percent downturn last December over
the same period in 1995, the country's National Statistics
Institute (ISTAT) reported today.
</P>
<P>
The rise should be mainly attributed to the performance of
discount stores, which saw a 12.4 percent increase for the whole
year and 2.8 percent for December, ISTAT said.
</P>
<P>
However, sales through large department stores fell by 5.4
percent in 1996, while medium-size stores with 10 to 19 employees
recorded a virtually flat performance, up by a slender 0.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
Food stores witnessed the sharpest increase of 7.3 percent last
year, followed by perfume and cosmetics stores with 5.4 percent,
book stores with 1.7 percent and clothing and shoe stores with 0.2
percent.
</P>
<P>
Declines were seen in photo and optical equipment shops with
2.3 percent, furniture stores 0.9 percent and stores selling
household items 0.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
ISTAT's figure for December alone, signaling Christmas
shopping, showed a 4.2 percent increase for stores selling
household items and hardware, 1.4 percent for perfume shops and
0.4 percent for food stores.
</P>
<P>
Sales through other stores registered decreases during the
shopping season.

<HEADLINE> China Tightens Supervision over Insurance Business </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XIAMEN, April 9 (Xinhua) -- The central bank has vowed to
further rein in the country's insurance industry this year to
prevent financial risks and promote the sound development of the
insurance industry.
</P>
<P>
During its first ever national conference on insurance
supervision held in Xiamen, Fujian Province, the People's Bank of
China pledged to quicken the pace of insurance legislation and
rectify the insurance market by shutting down illicit
insurance agencies and brokerage firms and standardizing insurance
activities.
</P>
<P>
"All the illegal insurance activities will be seriously
penalized and a national checkup of the assets of the insurance
companies will urge them to reduce bad assets," said an official
with the supervisory department of the People's Bank of China.
</P>
<P>
Insurance industry associations will also be set up soon
throughout the country for better self-discipline in the industry
and halt devastating competition, he said.
</P>
<P>
China's insurance market has expanded noticeably in recent
years, with its premium income jumping 26 percent to 77.6 billion
yuan last year, and the insured value reaching 15.67 trillion
yuan, up 15 percent over the previous year.

SHENZHEN, April 9 (Xinhua) -- Shenzhen in South China's
Guangdong Province has been experimenting with selecting designs
for its construction projects through public bidding since March

</P>
<P>
According to the officials, the city has also promulgated a set

over bidding on designs and safeguarding fair competition, as well
as protecting the legitimate rights of bidders and bid initiators.
</P>
<P>
Since the implementation of this new system, the city's land

<HEADLINE> Background: ABCs of Basic Law of Hong Kong SAR (11-12) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 9 (Xinhua) -- Following are the ABCs of the
Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (11-12) in
a question-and-answer format:
</P>
<P>
Question: How is the Hong Kong SAR different from the special
economic zones in the mainland?
</P>
<P>
Answer: The Hong Kong SAR is a local administrative region
directly under the central government. It enjoys executive and
legislative powers and independent judicial power, including that
of final adjudication.
</P>
<P>
Special economic zones in the mainland, by comparison, enjoy
only preferential economic policies but not a high degree of
autonomy. While in the Hong Kong SAR the capitalist system will
remain unchanged for 50 years, special economic zones in the
mainland will continue to practice the socialist system.
</P>
<P>
Question: What are the differences between the government of
the Hong Kong SAR and the British Hong Kong government?
</P>
<P>
Answer: Differences between the two governments are
fundamental. The British Hong Kong government before July 1, 1997
is a government through which Britain imposes its colonial rule
over Hong Kong. The Hong Kong SAR government after July 1, 1997
will be the government of a special administrative region directly
under the central government after China resumes its exercise of
sovereignty over Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
The head of the British Hong Kong government is the governor
appointed by Britain. It is, therefore, the rule of Hong Kong by
the British. Whereas the Hong Kong SAR government will be formed
through local elections or consultations, and the chief executive
of the Hong Kong SAR will be appointed by the central
government. It is the rule of Hong Kong by Hong Kongers.
</P>
<P>
The British Hong Kong government implements royal instructions
from London, whereas the Hong Kong SAR government will implement
the Basic Law as the fundamental legal code.
</P>
<P>
Governors of Hong Kong have been accountable to the British
Crown and the British government, whereas the chief executive of
the Hong Kong SAR will be accountable to the central government of
China and the Hong Kong SAR.
</P>
<P>
The governor of Hong Kong has been appointed by the British
Queen, and Hong Kong people have no right of supervision over
him.
</P>
<P>
By contrast, if the chief executive of the Hong Kong SAR is
accused of serious law violations or serious dereliction of duty,
the legislature of the Hong Kong SAR may start impeachment
proceedings against him and report to the central government for
decision.

OTTAWA, April 8 (Xinhua) -- Canada announced today that it will
provide 2.6 million U.S. dollars' worth of food aid to victims of
flooding and famine in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea

</P>
<P>
This decision was made in response to a United Nations appeal
for the people of DPRK, and the food distribution will be
coordinated by the World Food Program, according to the Canadian
International Development Agency (CIDA).
</P>
<P>
"A famine in North Korea has created enormous suffering," said
Canadian Minister for International Cooperation Don Boudria.
</P>
<P>
"It is a priority for Canada's aid program, and an urgent moral
responsibility to respond," Boudria added.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Northeast Chinese Province Lightens Farmers' Burden </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, April 9 (Xinhua) -- Northeast China's Liaoning
Province has taken effective measures to lighten farmers'
financial burdens, and kept the ratio of miscellaneous charges
under five percent of farmers' net income.
</P>
<P>
The province has reduced more than 300 million yuan of illicit
fees on farmers over the past four years, abiding by the
percentage designated by the State Council, China's highest
governing body, said officials with the Provincial Agriculture
Department.
</P>
<P>
Trimming its payrolls, Tieling County has cut out 2,300
redundant personnel at the township and village level in the past
three years, saving farmers' 1.26 million yuan annually.
</P>
<P>
Entertainment allowances were another heavy burden on
farmers. The provincial government set a maximum limit. Beining
City even stopped running village canteens, and officials at the
township and village level are not allowed to eat in
restaurants. As a result, the city's entertainment expenses in
rural areas plummeted last year to only six percent that of the
previous year.
</P>
<P>
Also in the city, some leaders of one village apportioned
among villagers one million-yuan interest on loans for village
enterprises. They lost their jobs when an inspection
team discovered their malpractice.
</P>
<P>
The province defines explicitly that money turned over to
township governments by farmers is subject to unified management,
and may be incorporated into township revenues to prevent such
money from being misappropriated. To date, the stipulation has
been carried out in 80 percent of the townships of the province.
</P>
<P>
A budget and settlement system was introduced to reduce the
farmers' burdens. A card of detailed list of reasonable charges is
presented to each family. Farmers can refuse to pay for extra
fees. More than 90 percent of farmers now hold this card.
</P>
<P>
Efforts of this kind have encouraged farmers to invest more
in agricultural production. And their initiative contributed
greatly to the province's growing grain output, which exceeded
more than 16 billion kilograms last year.

<HEADLINE> Chongqing Develops Tourism Resources </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHONGQING, April 9 (Xinhua) -- China's youngest municipality of
Chongqing plans to achieve an annual growth rate of eight to ten
percent in the city's tourism sector in the coming five years.
</P>
<P>
This means that by the year of 2000, Chongqing will receive
350,000 overseas tourists and earn 150 million U.S. dollars a year
from related services, according to Zou Jiping, deputy director of
Chongqing Municipal Tourism Administration.
</P>
<P>
She went on to say that booming tourism will help create
employment opportunities for 200,000 people who have to be
resettled because of the on-going construction of a gigantic water
control dam at the Three Gorges on the middle reaches of the
Yangtze River. The three Gorges Area falls right under the
jurisdiction of Chongqing Municipality directly under the central
government.
</P>
<P>
Chongqing, located on the juncture of Yangtze and Jialing
rivers, is a city built on a range of hills and is home to many
important historical and cultural relics. It is also well known
for a host of places associated with famous Chinese figures and
events, and its unique cuisine.
</P>
<P>
However, the city, well-known for its heavy fog, has long been
treated by tourists as a stepping stone on their tours to the
Three Gorges area, and many tourists go directly to cruisers after
their planes land, without spending one night in Chongqing.
</P>
<P>
According to the deputy director, the city has been developing
a number of quality tourism programs to attract more domestic and
overseas tourists and make them want to stay longer in Chongqing
and the Three Gorges Dam area.
</P>
<P>
The city was visited by 150,000 overseas tourists last year, an
increase of 25 percent over the previous year.

<HEADLINE> Citic to Invest in Shanxi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 9 (Xinhua) -- China's International Trust and
Investment Corp (Citic) will begin building a 100 million
US dollar-worth project in landlocked Shanxi Province next year,
according to today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
In accordance with a contract signed in Beijing yesterday, a
new joint venture, the Shanxi International Casting Co. Ltd., will
be established to manufacture engine-related castings for medium
and heavy-duty diesel engines.
</P>
<P>
The first phase of the project, involving investment of
44.3 million US dollars, will upgrade an existing factory and
produce 45,000 tons of castings a year.
</P>
<P>
The total annual production capacity of the project is expected
to reach 85,000 tons of castings, after the second phase
requiring 54.5 million US dollars is completed by 2003.
</P>
<P>
The project is scheduled to kick off in early 1998.
</P>
<P>
Southwest China's Guangxi Yuchai Machinery Company Ltd, one of
the largest engine producers in the country, is expected to become
the main domestic customer, and about 40 percent of the output
will be exported.
</P>
<P>
The project is one that carries out the central government's
policy of encouraging more investment in central and western
regions, where it will take advantage of abundant raw materials in
Shanxi province.
</P>
<P>
Shanxi, located southwest of Beijing, has been designated as a
key economic zone in China due to its plentiful resources
including coal and pig iron, its qualified labor force and its low
cost untilities.
</P>
<P>
Citic is a main official investment arm under the State Council
directly, whose total capital has reached 191.5 billion yuan.

<HEADLINE> Chongqing Boosts Service Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHONGQING, April 9 (Xinhua) -- Chongqing, upgraded last month
to municipality status, is devoting major efforts to develop the
service trade.
</P>
<P>
An old industrial base, Chongqing had previously stressed
industry and agriculture.
</P>
<P>
Service industry developed rapidly since the 1990s. The
percentage of the service trade in the city's Gross Domestic
Product (GDP) grew from 10 percent to 33 percent. But, that is
much lower than the average rate of 45 percent in three other
municipalities -- Beijing, Tianjin, and Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
The government of Chongqing pledges it will raise the ratio of
service trade in the city's GDP to 40 percent by the year 2000 and
to 52 percent by 2010.
</P>
<P>
Commerce, finance, tourism, communications and
telecommunications, real estate, and information industries have
been listed on top of the agenda for future development.
</P>
<P>
Chongqing will build an international trade center, set up a
financial zone, open tourist routes at the Three Gorges of the
Yangtze River, Wujiang Canyon, and Wuling Mountain, and build a
communication network which combines air, water, and highway
traffic.

<P>
RIO DE JANEIRO, April 8 (Xinhua) -- Renato Guerreiro, executive
secretary of Brazil's Telecommunications Ministry, announced that
the "B" band of Brazil's cellular telephone services will be
privatized at the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
The sale of the B band of cellular telephone services to

Brazil's telecommunications sector, the official was quoted as
saying by the local press today.
</P>
<P>
Fifteen domestic and foreign consortiums participated in the
public auction held Tuesday by the Brazilian Telecommunications
Ministry for the installation and operation of cellular telephone
services at the above-mentioned frequency.
</P>
<P>
The authorities will announce who won the bid within 60 days.
The government will receive 6 billion U.S. dollars from the
privatization of this cellular telephone service.
</P>
<P>
Approximately 95 percent of the services offered by Brazil's
telecommunications sector belongs to the state and 3 million
Brazilians use cellular telephone services.
</P>
<P>
According to Telecommunications Minister Sergio Motta, the
conventional telephone sector will also be privatized within the
next two or three years.

<HEADLINE> Nine-man Tenerife Beat Schalke 1-0 at Uefa Semis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MADRID, April 8 (Xinhua) -- Spain's Tenerife hung on for a 1-0
win over Schalke of Germany despite conceding a penalty and being
reduced to nine men in an UEFA Cup semi-final first leg match in
Tenerife on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Tenerife scored the winning goal through a fifth-minute penalty
but lost their way when Angel Vivar Dorado was sent off early in
the second half.
</P>
<P>
The Spanish side survived a penalty miss after goalkeeper
Marcelo Ojeda was dismissed 15 minutes from the end.
</P>
<P>
The Spaniards controlled the opening phase of the match and
were rewarded quickly when Juanele Castanos broke down the right
and was brought down in the area by Schalke captain Olaf Thon.
</P>
<P>
The German eleven started strongly after the break, but it was
Tenerife's Felipe who came closest to scoring in the early
minutes, curling wide a shot after the Spaniards regained the
ball after a mistake by Thon.
</P>
<P>
But ten minutes into the second half the game changed shape
radically when Angel Vivar Dorado was sent off for elbowing
Radoslav Latal in retaliation for a heavy challenge.
</P>
<P>
From then on Tenerife lived dangerously as Schalke's Marc
Wilmots hit the bar with a header and Ingo Anderbruegge forced two
fine saves out of Ojeda.
</P>
<P>
Ojeda's last-ditch challenge earned him a red card and his
place was taken by substitute goalkeeper Bengt Andersson.
</P>
<P>
But Andersson was called on to make a series of saves in a
frantic last 15 minutes as Schalke tried to level the score.
</P>
<P>
Schalke will play the second leg game without suspended Andreas
Mueller but Tenerife will be without Ojeda, Vivar Dorado and
Antonio Robaiana, who was sent off in their last tie.

<HEADLINE> Sino-Canada Shipping Agreement Signed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 9 (Xinhua) -- China and Canada have signed a
maritime agreement facilitating ship traffic between the two
countries, China Daily reported today.
</P>
<P>
The accord, Canada's first maritime pact with a foreign
country, was reached last week in Vancouver by visiting Chinese
Minister of Communications Huang Zhendong and Canadian Transport
Minister David Anderson, the newspaper cited information from the
Ministry of Communications (MOC) as saying.
</P>
<P>
The pact provides most-favored-nation (MFN) treatment
concerning port access and the assessment of port charges,
facilitates the opening of shipping-line offices, gives companies
tax relief and calls for closer cooperation in the investigation
of marine accidents.
</P>
<P>
Sources from MOC said that the accord followed another new
maritime agreement signed late last month between China and Israel
when Huang's delegation was visiting the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
According to the same sources, China has signed more than 50
bilateral maritime accords with other countries.
</P>
<P>
Gao Weijie, president of the Transport Department of the
Chinese Overseas Shipping Company (COSCO), said the new accord
will strengthen shipping links between COSCO and Canada and
increase the company's business there.
</P>
<P>
As a leading container shipping line in China, COSCO ranks
among the world's top five container services. The company's
vessels regularly sail directly to Canada's west coast port,
Vancouver, and to eastern Canada via New York Port.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Farmers Assured of Sufficient Production Materials </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 9 (Xinhua) -- The supply of agricultural
production materials will meet farmers' demands in this spring
sowing season, and their quality is ensured, today's China Daily
quoted a survey by the State Statistics Bureau as saying.
</P>
<P>
The supply of 13 surveyed materials, including fertilizers,
pesticides, and plastic sheeting, will cover more than 90 percent
of the demand and in some cases more than 100 percent.
</P>
<P>
Governments at all levels spare no efforts to make those
materials available for farmers in order to further promote
agricultural production.
</P>
<P>
In most province-level areas, there is an abundant or even
surplus of fertilizers, while in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous
Region, the supply is 77 percent more than demand.
</P>
<P>
The survey showed that most areas have prepared abundant
farm-use tools, fuel and seeds.
</P>
<P>
Farm production means companies pledged to provide high quality
materials. A state company in Dingnan County, east China's Jianxi
Province, even told farmers that it would give awards to those who
turned out to buy fake or shoddy goods from any of its 68 supply
centres.

<HEADLINE> "Le Petit Prince" to Be Staged in Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 9 (Xinhua) -- "Le Petit Prince", a French fairy
tale for adults, written by Antoine Saint-Exupery, will be
performed on stage here from April 17 to May 3.
</P>
<P>
"Le Petit Prince" describes the human world through the eyes of
a little prince coming from another planet. It was revised into
a play and has been popular for several decades worldwide.
</P>
<P>
Chinese director Dai Rong has set the play in a traditional
bar. Saint-Exupery, a World War II pilot, tells of his experience
in the Sahara after his plane was shot down, when he and the
little alien prince made contact.
</P>
<P>
Dai said that she tried to make the drama full of humor and joy
and reveal people's heart-felt passion hidden behind the complex
society.
</P>
<P>
Actors and actresses of the drama, with an average age of less
than 25, are graduates or students of Central Drama Institute and
the Beijing Film Academy. They received support from the French
Embassy in China.

<HEADLINE> UK's Sleaze MP Confirmed as Conservative Candidate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 8 (Xinhua) -- The local members of Britain's
ruling Conservative Party today confirmed Neil Hamilton, a
Conservative MP accused of taking cash for asking parliamentary
questions, as their candidate for the May 1 election.
</P>
<P>
Local Conservative Party Tresurer Tony Martin said Hamilton was
adopted by a vote of 182-100 by party members at a meeting in
Knutsford city in northwestern England, local reports said.
</P>
<P>
Hamilton, former Conservative industry minister, has
consistently denied the allegations in the cash-for-questions
scandal that has forced another Conservative MP to step down. He
has resisted strong pressure from the Conservative party to quit
the election.
</P>
<P>
The Conservative Party has been hit hard by financial and
sexual scandals that had make it 20 points behind Labor Party in
opinion polls.
</P>
<P>
Hamilton's persistence to give way was challenged by BBC war
correspondent Martin Bell who stood last Sunday against him as an
anti-corruption candidate. He is supported by both main opposition
parties, the Labor and the Liberal Democrats, who have withdrawn
their candidates to boost Bell's bid.
</P>
<P>
Although many Conservative MP demanded Hamilton to step down,
Prime Minister John Major had refused to get involved, saying the
decision on who should stand for the seat of Tatton constituency
should be left to the local party.
</P>
<P>
"It is the responsibility of the people who elect their MP in
the Conservative Party to select or deselect a candidate, and it
is the responsibility of the candidate to decide whether or not
they will stand," Major told local press earlier today.

<HEADLINE> White House to Apologize for Syphilis Experiment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 8 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. government will
formally apologize to the black men in Tuskegee, Alabama, whose
syphilis went untreated as part of a 40-year federal study, the
White House said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
President Bill Clinton will issue the apology soon, said White
House spokeswoman Mary Ellen Glynn.
</P>
<P>
The decision was announced as four survivors of the experiments
came forward in Alabama to demand an apology.
</P>
<P>
The government has moved toward an apology for the Tuskegee
experiment in recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
In the experiment, the U.S. Public Health Service withheld
treatment from 399 men between 1932 and 1972 to study how syphilis
spread and how it killed.
</P>
<P>
The men were not told they had the disease and were not given
penicillin, the standard treatment since 1947.
</P>
<P>
There are eight surviving participants, the youngest being 87
years old. Four of them met Tuesday at a church in Notasulga,
Alabama, that once served as an intake station for the study.

<HEADLINE> US Senate to Vote on Chemical Weapons Convention </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 8 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Senate Republicans
today agreed to hold a ratification vote on the Chemical Weapons
Convention (CWC) before April 29, when the treaty goes into
effect.
</P>
<P>
Senate Republicans and Democratic leaders separately announced
the decision for a vote on the treaty, however without giving a
exact date. The ratification will need a two thirds majority.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was reached while the Republicans attacked the
treaty during a Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing.
</P>
<P>
Testifying before the hearing, U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright appealed to the Committee late today for help
in ratifying the treaty, which she said is "one of the president's
top foreign policy priorities."
</P>
<P>
The CWC needs to pass the Committee before going to the full
Senate for ratification.
</P>
<P>
Opening the hearing on the convention, Jesse Helms, chairman of
the Committee, enlisted four former defense chiefs who spoke
against the treaty to block ratification of the treaty.
</P>
<P>
Three former defense secretaries, James Schlesinger, Donald
Rumsfeld and Caspar Weinberger attended the hearing while Richard
Cheney, defense secretary under President George Bush sent a
letter to the hearing to criticize the CWC.
</P>
<P>
"The case against the treaty can be summarized quite simply, I
think. It is not global, it is not verifiable, it is not
constitutional, and it will not work," Helms told the hearing.
</P>
<P>
The treaty, signed in January, 1993 in paris, has been signed
by 161 countries and ratified by 70 of them up to now. It goes
into force on April 29.
</P>
<P>
The Clinton administration organized a rally last week,
attended by senior officials and arms experts, urging the Senate
to approve the treaty, which bans the development, production,
stockpiling, transfer and use of all chemical weapons.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton have recruited a long list of
prominent figures supporting the endorsement of the treaty.
</P>
<P>
Supporters led by Clinton for the ratification of the treaty
argued that the treaty serves the interests of the U.S. and if it
is not ratified by the Senate before April 29, the U.S. will be in
the "company of the rogue states."
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, the U.S. chemical companys will be restricted in
trade, resulting in a loss of millions of dollars for the U.S.
while the U.S. would lose its role in implementing the treaty.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Envoy Calls for End of Nuclear Deterrence Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, April 8 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Ambassador for
Disarmament Affairs Sha Zukang on Tuesday called for an end of the
nuclear deterrence policy, which is exercised by the United
States, Britain and France.
</P>
<P>
He made the call in a speech to the First Session of the
Preparatory Committee for the 2000 Review Conference of the
Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons
(NPT).
</P>
<P>
"It will be fair to say that since the indefinite extension of
the NPT in 1995, significant progress has been achieved in the
field of international arms control and disarmament," he said,
citing the adoption of the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban (CTBT),
the coming into force of the Chemical Weapons Convention, etc.
</P>
<P>
But he said these developments are far from meeting the
expectations of the international community.
</P>
<P>
"some countries are still adhering to the policy of nuclear
deterrence based on the first use of nuclear weapons, and are
trying to find all excuses to justify their development and
deployment of missile defense systems which undermine strategic
security and stability," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that China stands for the complete prohibition and
thorough destruction of nuclear weapons and regards NPT and CTBT
as intermediate steps leading to the complete prohibition and
thorough destruction of nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
"Pending the complete elimination of nuclear weapons, the
nuclear-weapon states concerned should abandon their policy of
nuclear deterrence; states with the largest nuclear arsenals
should further reduce drastically their nuclear stockpiles;..." he
said.

</P>
<P>
The commission should also raise specific recommendations to

everything that had and had not been achieved in the context of
the outcome of the Rio.
</P>
<P>
Joke Waller-Hunter, Director of the UN Division for Sustainable
Development, stressed that the commission should send a document
to the special session that provided solutions.
</P>
<P>
The document would be an input to the special session which
must convey a sense of urgency and reaffirm the highest-level
political support for sustainable development, recognizing the
interdependence of its economic, social and environmental
components, she added.
</P>
<P>
Chiefs of other UN agencies and representatives of several
countries also spoke at today's meeting.
</P>
<P>
During the three-week session, the 53-member commission would

WASHINGTON, April 8 (Xinhua) -- The home prices in the U.S.,
Americans' most important assets, rose in most areas last year,
the U.S. National Association of Home Builders reported today.
</P>
<P>
Nationally, the median price of new and existing homes advanced
by 2.6 percent over the year to 120,000 dollars in the fourth
quarter, according to a survey released by the association.
</P>
<P>
That means home values, in general, rose with inflation. The
core inflation rate last year -- minus volatile food and energy
prices -- also was 2.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
Nationally, 130 of 184 metro areas in the U.S. recorded median
price increases, while 39 showed a drop. There was no change in
nine areas, while comparative data were not available in six.
</P>
<P>
As usual, the highest median prices of homes were mostly in
California while the lowest median prices were in some areas of

from 125.56 yen Monday. The dollar cost 1.7143 marks, up from
1.7109 and the highest since March 6. The pound cost 1.6260 U.S.
dollars, down from 1.6295 U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The remarks by Shinji Sato came one day after the dollar
surpassed 125 yen for the first time since January 1993, and were
interpreted by traders as a signal that both Japan and the United
States won't intervene to halt the U.S. currency's ascent
currently.
</P>
<P>
The dollar also was helped by the third straight day of gains
in the U.S. stock market as well as a continuous weakness in the
mark, which suffered from growing expectations that Europe's
single currency will be launched as scheduled as well as news that
German employment remained inactive in March.
</P>
<P>
Other late dollar rates in New York compared with Monday: 1.4735
Swiss francs, up from 1.4674; 5.7660 French francs, up from 5.7530;
1,688.50 Italian lira, up from 1,684.00; 1.3882 Canadian dollars,
up from 1.3867.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Considers More Food Aid to DPRK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 8 (Xinhua) -- The United States is
considering to provide more food aid to the Democratic People's
Republic of Korea (DPRK) as Pyongyang has agreed to open a second
round of talks with Washington over foreign missile sales, the
State Department said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns said at a news
briefing that the United States is "seriously reviewing" the last
week's appeal by the U.N. World Food Program to help the DPRK cope
with serious food shortage.
</P>
<P>
Burns also said DPRK officials, who met U.S. officials in New
York last Friday, had "indicated to us their willingness to hold a
second round of missile talks very soon."
</P>
<P>
The first round of missile talks took place in April 1996.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. willingness to consider more food aid and the planned
missile talks come as Washington and South Korea await a formal
response from the DPRK to their proposal for four-party peace
talks, including DPRK, U.S., South Korea and China.

PARIS, April 8 (Xinhua) -- France and Russia will coordinate
their actions over the Middle East to help end the impasse of the
peace process for the region, said French Foreign Minister Herve
de Charette and his Russian counterpart Yevgeni Primakov today.
</P>
<P>
"We are ready to work together, in a coordinated way, to give
a strong impulse to the peace process," said Primakov after
having a two-hour meeting with de Charette.
</P>
<P>
Primakov arrived here this afternoon to discuss with French
leaders the relations between Russia and the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO).
</P>
<P>
"We shared an extreme worry over the situation concerning the
Middle East and the peace process," said de Charette. "We agreed
to keep in close touch to put together our efforts, between Russia
for one side, and France and Europe for the other, in order to
renew the thread of the peace process."
</P>
<P>
They also agreed that the peace process cannot be resumed
unless on the basis of the agreements already signed by Israel and
the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
The Middle East peace process has entered an impasse after
Israel decided to build a new housing project in Har Homa district
of East Jerusalem, which triggered a wave of angry protests from
the Palestinians.

<HEADLINE> Recruitment Picks up in UK Financial Sector </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 8 (Xinhua) -- Employment in Britain's financial
service sector rose for the first time in the past three months in
more than two years, according to the latest survey of the sector
by the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) and Coopers &AMP;
Lybrand, the consultants.
</P>
<P>
The survey, published Monday and covering more than 300
companies, showed that a positive balance of 11 percent of firms
reported staff recruitment, compared with negative balances of
nine percent in December and 29 percent a year ago.
</P>
<P>
The report said that stockbrokers and fund managers led the way
in boosting employment while general insurers and insurance
brokers continued to cut staff heavily.
</P>
<P>
But the rise in employment is likely to level off during the
next three months, the survey said.
</P>
<P>
Although the CBI said that the figures were encouraging, it
pointed out that "the survey does indicate a reduced tempo of
growth" as demand was expected to rise only slightly over the
coming year.
</P>
<P>
Overall business optimism rose for the fifth quarter in a row,
but the pick-up was slower than at any time since December 1995,
with the positive balance down from 61 percent to 26 percent.
</P>
<P>
Growth in business volumes also slowed from a positive balance
of 79 percent in the December survey to 39 percent, with
securities traders, banks and venture capitalists reporting the
largest increases in volumes while building societies reporting a
small decrease.
</P>
<P>
The survey also found that the sector's spending on information
technology will continue to be strong while investment in land and
buildings is expected to fall.

NEW YORK, April 8 (Xinhua) -- New York stocks extended a modest
rebound Tuesday from the market's recent selloff even though bonds
stumbled again amid fear about inflation and interest rates.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average rallied over the final half
hour, adding 53.25 points to 6,609.16. In the past three sessions,
the gauge of 30 big U.S. companies has recovered about 130 of the

</P>
<P>
Broad-market indicators also had modest gains for the third

</P>
<P>
As bond prices fell Tuesday, the yield on the 30-year Treasury
bond rose and settled at about 7.10 percent.
</P>

Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 6-to-5 margin on

<HEADLINE> Many Questions Remain Between Russia, NATO: Primakov </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, April 8 (Xinhua) -- Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeni
Primakov said here today that "many questions remain to be
solved" before Russia and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization
(NATO) can reach an agreement defining the relations between the
two former enemies during the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
During his meetings with French Foreign Minister Herve de
Charette and Prime Minister Alain Juppe, Primakov renewed Russia's
opposition to the eastward expansion plan by NATO, which Moscow
regards as a threat for its national security, reported Agence
France-Presse.
</P>
<P>
He said that although Russia is working hard to "obtain a
document" with NATO, this does not mean that it has changed its
attitude toward the expansion of the Western military alliance,
but is only an attempt by Moscow to "minimize the consequences
which could result from the enlargement of NATO."
</P>
<P>
Primakov refused to say in which date or venue Russia will sign
such a document with NATO, and only said that Moscow wishes to
conclude the agreement "as rapidly as possible."
</P>
<P>
He said that he discussed with French foreign minister Russia's
concern over "the perspective of the advancement of the military
infrastructure of NATO toward the frontiers of Russia."
</P>
<P>
He expressed the wish that a treaty on the reduction of
conventional arms in Europe be modernized, and recalled that
Russian President Boris Yeltsin and U.S. President Bill Clinton
agreed in Helsinki last month to accelerate negotiations on
reduction of conventional weapons in Europe in order to attain an
agreement by the Summer of this year.
</P>
<P>
"Up to now we (Russia and the United States) have agreed to
avoid the deployment of combat forces of NATO in a permanent way
beyond the territories of the 16 (NATO) member countries," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Although NATO has agreed that it will not deploy nuclear
weapons or permanently deploy troops in the countries to be
absorbed by it, it has never promised Moscow that it will never
deploy military infrastructure in these countries.
</P>
<P>
Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic will be absorbed by NATO
in the first wave of its expansion in 1999.

<HEADLINE> Al Chief: Economic Cooperation Possible Only After </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, April 7 (Xinhua) -- Secretary General of the Arab
League (AL) Esmat Abdul Meguid said today that regional
economic cooperation can not be materialized unless a just and
comprehensive peace is realized in the region.
</P>
<P>
According to reports reaching here today from the Bahraini
capital of Manama, Meguid made the remarks in his speech at the
fifth Gulf Economic Symposium, which opened today under the theme
of "international strategies and relations by the turn of the 21st
century among the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) states."
</P>
<P>
Meguid said that recent incidents that took place in the region
will exert important influence over some regional countries,
thus complicating the ongoing peace talks between Israel and Arab
countries concerned.
</P>
<P>
The Al chief stressed that Arab countries adhere to peace,
which is their strategic choice. The Arab countries have
consistently made efforts to realize this choice so as to achieve
security and stability in the region.
</P>
<P>
For this purpose, Meguid said, the Arab world has long agreed
to realize a just, durable and comprehensive peace in the Middle
East.

<HEADLINE> China's GDP Growth Should Be in 9-10% Range in 1997, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 8 (Xinhua) -- Assuming a strong global economy,
China's GDP growth should be in the 9-10% range in 1997, according
to HSBC's monthly report, "Global Outlook", published here today.
</P>
<P>
The report said, China achieved its goal of a soft landing for
the economy in 1996 as GDP growth eased to 9.7% from 10.5% in
1995.
</P>
<P>
After rising by 13.1% in 1996 and 13.7% in Q4 alone, its
industrial output (value-added) growth fell to 10.3% in January.
</P>
<P>
Retail sales of consumer goods in China, however, have remained
buoyant, increasing by 16% in January, up from 13.5% in Q4.
</P>
<P>
Global Outlook said, China's retail inflation was at 3.3% in
January, compared with 4.6% in Q4 and an average of 6.1% for all
of 1996. January's consumer price inflation was 5.9% versus 6.8%
in Q4.
</P>
<P>
Inflation should remain at the single digit level in 1997 due
to measures such as China's continued tight credit policy, it
added.
</P>
<P>
China's exports continued its recovery in the second half,
cumulating in a rise of 12.2% in Q4. Imports recorded positive
growth of 3.6% Q4 and 12.2 Billion US dollars for 1996.
</P>
<P>
China's trade surplus expanded further by 1.7 billion US
dollars in January, with exports rising by 27.5% and imports
declining by 1.2% during the month.
</P>
<P>
The poor import performance in January, the report said,
indicated that the rebound in late 1996 was probably due to a rush
by certain foreign-invested enterprises to break the end-1996
deadline for the elimination of tax/duty exemptions on capital
goods imports.
</P>
<P>
Utilized foreign direct investment (FDI) in China maintained
steady growth, rising by 8.5% in Q4 following growth of 7.7% in
Q3, according to HSBC.
</P>
<P>
Contractual FDI in China, however, continued to fall, down by
62.6% in Q4 after a decline of 32% in Q3 that was due mainly to
the withdrawal of import tax and duty exemptions for foreign
investors on 1 April 1996.
</P>
<P>
An expanding trade surplus and steady capital inflow boosted
foreign exchange reserves in China to the record level of 105
billion US dollars by end-1996, up from 73.6 billion US dollars at
end-1995.
</P>
<P>
The Renminbi exchange rate against the US dollar remained
within the 8.30-8.33 range throughout 1996, but the unit has been
trading on the strong side since last July, rising to 8.29 by the
end of February 1997.
</P>
<P>
In a major move to reform its foreign exchange regime, China
declared the Renminbi fully convertible for current account
transactions in line with International Monetary Fund requirements
starting 1st December, four years ahead of the original schedule.
</P>
<P>
So far, the new arrangement has not had any noticeable impact
on the Renminbi exchange rate, the report said.

<HEADLINE> Japanese Car Exports to U.S. Rise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, April 8 (Xinhua) -- Japanese car makers are
increasing their sales in the United States, taking the advantage
of a soft yen.
</P>
<P>
The major three automakers in the U.S. said Japanese companies
are playing the weak yen and exports to boost profits and Japan's
weak economy.
</P>
<P>
The complaints come as Japan's trade surplus with the U.S.
widened in February for the second month in a row. Autos and auto
parts account for two-thirds of the surplus.
</P>
<P>
In New York trading today, the U.S. dollar hit an intraday high
of 126.52 yen, the strongest since August 1992, before settling at
126.23 yen, up from 125.56 yen Monday. The dollar-has jumped 57
percent against the yen during the past two years and is up 9
percent this year.
</P>
<P>
The weak yen has helped Japanese automakers widen their
profits. In January, vehicles exported from Japan to the United
States leaped 75 percent from a year ago.
</P>
<P>
Local press reported that Japanese automakers have gained about
2 percentage points of the market share in the U.S. this year. And
U.S. automakers have lost about 2.5 points.
</P>
<P>
But Japanese automakers argued that it was market demand that
fueled the increases.

<HEADLINE> President Mobutu Declares State of Emergency in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, April 8 (Xinhua) -- Ailing President Mobutu Sese Seko
declared a state of emergency today in Zaire, the third largest
country in Africa, about a third of which is under rebel control,
a report from Kinshasa said.
</P>
<P>
Speaking over state television in the Zairean capital, Mobutu
said a state of emergency declared in the eastern provinces of
north and south Kivu last year "is extended throughout the
national territory".
</P>
<P>
Five military governors had been appointed in provinces not
held by the rebels, said Mobutu, who added the emergency covers
capital Kinshasa which has five million people.
</P>
<P>
Mobutu, who seized power in 1965, has seen his hold over the
country weakened by relentless rebel advances. The rebel Alliance
of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo-Zaire (ADFL)
took up arms last October vowing to topple him.
</P>
<P>
They took Kisangani, the third largest city in Zaire in late
March after foiling an offensive launched by government troops in
February. Their forces are now advancing toward Lubumbashi,
capital of copper-rich Shaba province and they have vowed to
seize Kinshasa in June.

<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, April 8 (Xinhua) -- Lingering fuel scarcity in Lagos
may soon ebb, as the head of state General Sani Abacha has
ordered immediate supply of fuel to the largest Nigerian city.
</P>
<P>
Military Administrator of Lagos State Mohammed Marwa announced
this to anxious motorists outside a petrol station in Lagos
today.
</P>
<P>
He told the people that the head of state has ordered the
importation of more fuel to end the crisis that started about
three weeks ago in Lagos and has spread to other parts of the
country, including Abuja, the national capital.
</P>
<P>
The head of state is especially concerned about Lagos because
it is the economic nerve center of the country, he said, adding
that the fuel scarcity would be over in a couple of days.
</P>
<P>
Residents in Lagos have been much limited in their movement in
the past days. Fuel scarcity has also driven bus fares and food
prices higher.
</P>
<P>
Worried by spreading fuel crisis, Abacha called the
administrators and oil industry officials to the capital on
Monday to find a solution.
</P>
<P>
According to Marwa, the government will also move to repair
the country's ailing refineries, which are the fundamental reason
behind the outbreak of fuel crisis from time to time in this
largest oil producing country in Africa.

<HEADLINE> Former US Defense Chiefs Oppose Chemical Weapons Convention </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 8 (Xinhua) -- Four former U.S. defense
secretaries, together with Senator Jesse Helms, today expressed
their strong opposition towards the Chemical Weapons Convention
(CWC).
</P>
<P>
Opening a Senate hearing on the convention, Helms, chairman of
the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, enlisted four former
defense chiefs who spoke against the treaty to block ratification
of the treaty.
</P>
<P>
Three former defense secretaries, James Schlesinger, Donald
Rumsfeld and Caspar Weinberger attended the hearing while Richard
Cheney, defense secretary under President George Bush sent a
letter to the hearing to criticize the CWC.
</P>
<P>
"The case against the treaty can be summarized quite simply, I
think. It is not global, it is not verifiable, it is not
constitutional, and it will not work," Helms told the hearing.
</P>
<P>
The treaty, signed in January, 1991 in paris, has been signed
by 161 countries and ratified by 70 of them. It goes into force
on April 29.
</P>
<P>
The Clinton administration organized a rally last week,
attended by senior officials and arms experts, urging the Senate
to approve the treaty, which bans the development, production,
stockpiling, transfer and use of all chemical weapons.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton have recruited a long list of
prominent figures supporting the endorsement of the treaty.
</P>
<P>
Supporters led by Clinton for the ratification of the treaty
argued that the treaty serves the interests of the U.S. and if it
is not ratified by the Senate before April 29, the U.S. will be in
the "company of the rogue states."
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, the U.S. chemical companys will be restricted in
trade, resulting in a loss of millions of dollars for the U.S.
while the U.S. would lose its role in implementing the treaty.
