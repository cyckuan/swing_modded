<HEADLINE> Iran Condemns Israeli Attacks on Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, March 14 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Ministry
spokesman Hamid Reza Asefi strongly condemned Sunday the Israeli
bomb attacks on south Lebanon, which wounded two Lebanese
civilians.
</P>
<P>
Asefi said that the Israeli bombardments of south Lebanese
villages were "clear violation of the Lebanese sovereignty," the
Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
He termed Tel Aviv as the main source of tension and
instability in the region, saying that measures taken by the
Israeli regime forced the region towards insecurity and tension.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian spokesman called for serious attention from the
international community and world public opinion to the issue of
Israel's "inhumane measures."
</P>
<P>
A Lebanese man and woman were wounded Sunday by shells fired by
Israeli forces.
</P>
<P>
The shelling came in retaliation for attacks launched by
Iranian-backed Hezbollah guerrilla on positions of Israeli troops
and the Israeli-allied South Lebanon Army (SLA).
</P>
<P>
The Hezbollah has been fighting to oust Israeli occupation
troops and the SLA from south Lebanon, where Israel set up a
security zone in 1985 with the claim of protecting its north from
Lebanese guerrillas cross-border attacks.

<HEADLINE> Palestinians Keen on Seeking Cooperation with </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, March 14 (Xinhua) -- The Palestinians are keen on
seeking cooperation with Egypt and views of President Hosni
Mubarak on the Mideast peace process, a senior Palestinian
official said here on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to Egypt's Middle East News Agency, Palestinian
Minister of Planning and International Cooperation Nabil Shaath
said the two sides will examine the deadlock in the Mideast peace
process during the third session of the Palestinian-Egyptian
Higher Joint Committee.
</P>
<P>
Shaath blamed the stalemate on Israel's intransigence in the
peace march and failure to carry out the signed agreements.
</P>
<P>
The peace talks between the Palestinians and Israel have been
stalled since December when Israel shelved the Wye accord after
implementing the first of the three-phased withdrawal from another
13 percent of the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Shaath arrived here earlier in the day to co-chair the joint
committee session with Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
The committee session will give a momentum to the bilateral
trade and investment relations and activate the signed trade
agreements, he said.
</P>
<P>
The session will reflect the depth of the Palestinian-Egyptian
relation and the Palestinian National Authority's keenness on
enhancing cooperation with Egypt in the health, education,
industry, transportation and security domains, he added.
</P>
<P>
The two sides will probe the establishment of a fair of
Egyptian products in July in the Palestinian self-rule areas and
organization of meetings for businessmen on both sides to promote
economic cooperation, the Palestinian official said.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, March 14 (Xinhua) -- At least 26 people died while
several others were injured and thousands rendered homeless in a
devastating fire Sunday afternoon in a slum cluster in northern
Delhi, police sources said here tonight.
</P>
<P>
However, unofficial sources said more than 30 people were
killed in the fire which broke out at 15:30 local time and is yet
to be brought under control.
</P>
<P>
Firemen recovered about 20 charred bodies from a mosque located
in the area, inhabited mostly by rag pickers and stocked with
inflammable material.
</P>
<P>
Plastic material and a strong breeze from the nearby Yamuna
River fanned the flames which within minutes destroyed hundreds of
huts and rendered thousands homeless.
</P>
<P>
Police sources said 10 companies of the city police in riot
gear moved into the area to assist the fire brigade which was
attacked by angry residents protesting alleged delay in reaching
the spot.
</P>
<P>
The cause of the fire is yet to be ascertained.

<HEADLINE> UAE Renews Rap on Iran's Occupation of Gulf Islands </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, March 14 (Xinhua) -- Foreign Minister of the
United Arab Emirates (UAE) Rashid Bin Abdullah Al-Nuaimi
reiterated his country's rejection to Iran's recent actions on
three disputed Gulf islands.
</P>
<P>
"The provocative and unjustified Iranian conducts pose a
danger to the region, threaten to cause instability and do not
serve the good neighborly ties between Iran and the Gulf
Cooperation Council (GCC) states," Al-Nuaimi said at the opening
session of the GCC foreign ministerial meeting in Saudi capital
Riyadh Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Al-Nuaimi rebuffed Iran's establishment of a municipal office
and an educational complex on Abu Moussa island in February,
saying Tehran was seeking "to impose all illegal de facto
situation and solidify its occupation of the islands by means of
changing their demographic status."
</P>
<P>
"All these measures are deemed invalid," he said.
</P>
<P>
Both the UAE and Iran claimed sovereignty over the islands of
Abu Moussa, Greater and Lesser Tunbs, which are located near the
strategic shipping lanes at the mouth of the Gulf and potentially
oil-rich.
</P>
<P>
Iran has controlled the islands since 1971 after Britain ended
its protectorate. Tehran rejects international arbitration over
the islands and has so far offered negotiations on Abu Moussa
alone.
</P>
<P>
It has recently conducted massive military exercises near Abu
Moussa, which prompted strong protest from the UAE.
</P>
<P>
The UAE had called for an extraordinary meeting of the GCC
foreign ministers on March 4 to discuss the Iranian drills.
</P>
<P>
The GCC ministers condemned in a joint statement the maneuvers
and called on Tehran to end its occupation of the three islands.
</P>
<P>
These war games "will not help in confidence building because
they violate the UAE sovereignty and is an attempt by the Iranian
side to dedicate its occupation" of the three islands, the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
However, Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi strongly
criticized the GCC statement, saying it is "a source of regret and
certainly dose not help solve the disputes."
</P>
<P>
Kharrazi called on UAE officials to go to Tehran for talks
over the islands. "We have always called on the UAE to discuss
the problems between us in bilateral talks," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Today all problems can be solved through dialogue, but not
through intimidation and propaganda," Kharrazi added.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Jet Ignores Italian Rules Before Tragedy: Procuratorate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, March 14 (Xinhua) -- An Italian military procuratorate
confirmed Sunday that the American plane was making an
unauthorized flight when it cut a cable at a ski resort in
northern Italy, killing 20 people.
</P>
<P>
The EA-6B reconnaissance plane was among those military jets
that were forbidden by the Italian government to enter some areas
including the resort of Cavalese, the chief procurator said.
</P>
<P>
He said that Italy asked NATO planes except F-16s not to enter
the above-mentioned areas because local people often grumbled
about their awful noise.
</P>
<P>
The Italian government and military have not confirmed the
procuratorate's statement so far. However, local press said that
the Italian military indeed sent such a message to the NAT0
command, but failed to receive any response.
</P>
<P>
The pilot, Captain Richard Ashby, was cleared earlier this
month of 20 counts of involuntary manslaughter and other related
charges in a court-martial at Camp Lejeune in North Carolina. The
result enraged the Italian public.

<HEADLINE> Israel Reiterates Position Over Talks With Syria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 14 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Defense Minister Moshe
Arens reiterated on Sunday that the peace talks with Syria should
be resumed without any preconditions.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters during a tour in the town of Abu Gosh
near Jerusalem, Arens said that the resumption of the
negotiations is totally dependent on Syria.
</P>
<P>
Arens said that if Syria sticks to its position that Israel
must give up all of the Golan Heights, the talks will not be
resumed.
</P>
<P>
Israeli-Syrian peace talks broke off in February 1996 and
efforts to rekindle them have stumbled over the issue of the
Golan Heights captured by Israel in the 1967 war and later
annexed to the Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
Syria wants negotiations to be resumed where they left off
under Israel's former Labor government - with an agreement in
principle for a return of the Golan in exchange for security
guarantees and a full peace treaty.
</P>
<P>
But the Likud government, which came to power in 1996,
has refused to be tied to the Labor government's stance and
insisted that the peace talks should be resumed without any
preconditions.
</P>
<P>
Last month, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said
that he hoped to sign a peace agreement with Syria by the
end of the year.
</P>
<P>
But Syria has dismissed Netanyahu's remarks as "an election
propaganda," as Israel will hold early general elections on
May 17.

<P>
BONN, March 14 (Xinhua) -- European Union (EU) foreign
ministers ended a meeting Sunday with differing views on progress
made in resolving crucial Agenda 2000 finances disputes.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference, German Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer
said that the meeting has "made a decisive progress." and "I have
the compromise figures right in front of my eyes," added Fischer
who hosted the two-day meeting.
</P>
<P>
However, Wolfgang Schuessel, Austrian foreign minister, noted
that Fischer was putting too positive a spin on this meeting,
saying that "in the nuts an bolts of it there are still big
differences."
</P>
<P>
The so-called Agenda 2000 is a package including the EU's
budget, farm subsidies and structural aid which extends mainly to
poorer southern member states of the EU.
</P>
<P>
A farm spending compromise was agreed last Thursday but the
Austrian foreign minister said it was only firmly backed by 11 of
the bloc's 15 members..
</P>
<P>
French Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine cautioned that "the
assessment of the comprise is not over."

"Reservations are not just about money but also over its
contents," said Vedrine.

<P>
BONN, March 14 (Xinhua) -- With a deadline looming in less than
two weeks, European Union (EU) foreign ministers ended a meeting
Sunday with firmly differing views on progress made in resolving
crucial Agenda 2000 spending disputes.
</P>
<P>
German Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer said at a press
conference after the meeting that it had "made a decisive
progress." "I have the compromise figures right in front of my
eyes," he added.
</P>
<P>
But Austrian Foreign Minister Wolfgang Schuessel dampened this
view. He told reporters he believed Fischer was putting too
positive a spin on this meeting. He also said, "In the nuts and
bolts of it there are still big differences."
</P>
<P>
The so-called Agenda 2000 is a package including the EU's
budget, farm subsidies and structural aid which flows mainly to
poorer southern member states of the EU.
</P>
<P>
A farm spending compromise was agreed last Thursday but
Schuessel said it was only firmly backed by 11 of the bloc's 15
members.
</P>
<P>
Farm ministers overshot the prescribed average annual farm
spending level of U.S. 44.6 billion dollars by some 1 billion
dollars per year for the period 2000 to 2006.
</P>
<P>
French Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine said Paris had not yet
concluded its evaluation of the deal. "Reservations are not just
about money but also over its contents," he said.
</P>
<P>
Big differences at this foreign ministers meeting remained over
how to fund the EU's budget from 2000 to 2006. "We are far apart
from a solution," Fischer admitted. Schuessel also said, "This is
a difficult topic; we are not at the end of the tunnel."
</P>
<P>
Current EU financial arrangements expire at the end of this
year. Germany, the biggest contributions-nation of the EU, is
demanding a cut to its budget contribution.
</P>
<P>
But Britain firmly opposes the negotiations over his
multi-billion dollar annual EU rebate, as demanded by Germany. "We
have no interest in negotiating away the British rebate," said
British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook.
</P>
<P>
Setting structural and cohesion aid levels to southern EU
countries such as Spain, Portugal and Greece as well as Ireland
remains the other key issue of dispute.
</P>
<P>
Southern states want current levels of structural and cohesion
fund aid to be retained. Northern states, like Germany, are
calling for cuts.
</P>
<P>
Fischer said it was clear Portugal and Ireland had special
problems in this area and that they could not be left in the
lurch.
</P>
<P>
EU states were divided in three blocs on structural funds with
one-third wanting to spend 276 billion dollars in the period from
2000 to 2006, one-third backing 220 billion dollars and the final
third seeking less than 220 billion dollars, according to
Schuessel.

<HEADLINE> Lafontaine: He Quits Over "Poor Teamwork" in Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, March 14 (Xinhua) -- Oskar Lafontaine, who last week
resigned as German finance minister and chairman of its ruling
Social Democratic party (SPD), said Sunday that "poor teamwork" in
the government had compelled him to leave.
</P>
<P>
Lafontaine made this first remark to reporters outside his home
in the Saarland region since he quit Thursday following a policy
clash with Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder.
</P>
<P>
"I left because of the poor teamwork that we displayed over
recent months. You cannot work successfully if the teamwork is not
up to scratch," Lafontaine told the German Television ARD.
</P>
<P>
Lafontaine said his decision to quit had nothing to do with the
political direction of the Schroeder government "and what we have
achieved in the last few months."
</P>
<P>
Explaining his three days of public silence after stepping
down, something which puzzled commentators, Lafontaine said he had
needed time to come to terms with the decision to resign all his
political posts.
</P>
<P>
"I believe that will be understood by anyone who appreciates
what a decision like that means," He said.

MAPUTO, March 14 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's President-elect Olusegun
Obasanjo ended his good-will blitz visit to Mozambique Sunday
afternoon and left for Kenya to continue his first visit after he
won in the Nigerian general elections.
</P>
<P>
Before ending his hours-long visit, Obasanjo said at a press
conference that his current visit was not an official visit, but a
good-will visit aimed at expressing his thanks to Mozambican
President Joaquim Chissano and other leaders who have offered him
support during and after the days when he was imprisoned.
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian president-elect said that he wanted to use the
time before he take the office to visit some countries, so as to
get a better understanding of the domestic and regional situation,
as he had been kept away from politics and social life for a long
time.
</P>
<P>
Chissano said at the same occasion that Obasanjo has come to
Mozambique to see the situation here, so he could develop good
cooperation ties between Nigeria and Mozambique after he is
officially sworn in on May 29.
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian president-elect came to Mozambique after his
two-day visit to Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that Obasanjo will also visit other countries
including Namibia, Japan, Britain, France, Germany and the United
States.

<HEADLINE> Never Accept Confederation in Cyprus: President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, March 14 (Xinhua) -- Cypriot President Glafcos
Clerides Sunday reiterated that he will never accept the
establishment of a confederation on the Cyprus island.
</P>
<P>
He described the regime set up by the Turkish Cypriots in
northern Cyprus as illegal and called on the international
community to exercise its influence on the Turkish side so that it
displays a more constructive attitude.
</P>
<P>
Clerides made the remarks at a memorial service of a Cypriot
fighter, who died in the struggle for Cyprus' independence from
the British colonial rule from 1955-59.
</P>
<P>
Clerides said the international community is expected to step
up its efforts for the resumption of the Cyprus peace talks after
the April elections in Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Turkish Cypriot north and the
Greek Cypriot south since 1974 when Turkey landed its troops in
1974 and took over the northern third of the island after a failed
pro-Athens coup.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has since maintained 35,000 troops in northern Cyprus to
protect the Turkish Cypriots, who unilaterally declared in 1983
the "Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus," which is recognized
only by Ankara.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. has been trying for decades to reunite the island
through a bi-communal federation formula, but the bilateral peace
talks have been stalled since summer in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash has said he will not
resume negotiations with the government unless his regime is
recognized.
</P>
<P>
He also said he will not negotiate for a federal solution.
</P>
<P>
Clerides said the Greek Cypriot side is ready to participate in
all honesty and goodwill dialogue for a settlement based on
U.N. resolutions and within the framework set out by the
international organization.
</P>
<P>
Clerides criticized the Turkish side for "placing
insurmountable obstacles with its negative stance".

<HEADLINE> U.S., British Warplanes Bomb Iraqi Targets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, March 14 (Xinhua) -- U.S. and British warplanes
Sunday continued to bomb civilian facilities and military sites in
northern and southern Iraq, an Iraqi military spokesman announced.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi News Agency quoted the unnamed spokesman as saying
that at 8:50 a.m. (0550 GMT), 32 formations of U.S.-British
warplanes from Saudi and Kuwaiti bases violated southern Iraqi
airspace over Dhi-Qar, Najaf, Muthana and Basra provinces.
</P>
<P>
These jets raided some civilian facilities and military sites
in Muthana province, said the spokesman, adding that Iraqi
anti-aircraft units fired back and forced them to flee.
</P>
<P>
At noon, 11 formations of enemy planes from Turkish
airspace violated northern Iraqi airspace over Dohuk, Erbil
and Mosul provinces and bombarded civilian installations and
military sites, said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
Confrontations between Iraqi air defenses and U.S.-British
warplanes patrolling the no-fly zones almost occurred every day
since the mid-December U.S.-British air strikes against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The U.S.-led western allies imposed the no-fly zones in Iraq
after the 1991 Gulf War with a claimed aim of protecting the Kurds
in the north and the Shiite Muslims in the south from what they
called "Baghdad's suppression."
</P>
<P>
Iraq has declared that it does not recognize the no-fly zones
and will fire at any allied warplanes violating its airspace.

<TEXT>
<P>
PRISTINA, Kosovo, Yugoslavia, March 14 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslav
police and troops clashed Sunday with armed separatists in
western Kosovo, killing four of the separatists.
</P>
<P>
The clash took place near Klina early in the day when some
armed separatists opened fire at the Yugoslav police and troops
with automatic weapons and grenade propelors.
</P>
<P>
The following exchange of fire killed four members of the
separatists who all wore the uniforms of the Kosovo Liberation
Army, according to military sources here in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
In another development of the day, Zoran Andjelkovic, president
of the temporary executive council of the self-proclaimed republic
of Kosovo, described Saturday's bomb blasts as "the most violent
onslaught on the efforts to bring lasting peace to Kosovo."
</P>
<P>
He made the remark while visiting Sunday in the Pristina
hospital the wounded people of Saturday's three bomb blasts. He
urged bringing of the perpetrators of the bomb blasts to be
brought to justice.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Hezbollah Vows to Liberate Lebanon From Israeli </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, March 14 (Xinhua) -- Hezbollah's Secretary General
Hassan Nasrallah Sunday vowed that his group would continue its
resistance movement till the day when all Lebanese territory is
liberated from "Israeli enemies."
</P>
<P>
At a mass rally in southern suburb of Beirut on the occasion of
the 21st anniversary of Israeli invasion of Lebanon, he warned
Israel not to launch a large massive offensive against his
country, saying any aggression will have the same result of
failure.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of people across Lebanon held various demonstrations
against Israeli occupation on the same day.
</P>
<P>
In the country's eastern area of Hirmel, demonstrators burned
Israeli flags and chanted anti-Israeli slogans. They asked Israel
to comply with the United Nations Resolution 425 without
conditions.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon's commemoration came two weeks after Israeli forces
suffered the heaviest losses in more than one year in south
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
In less than a week last month, a total of seven Israeli
soliders, including a general, were killed in Hezbollah
guerrillas' ambushes.
</P>
<P>
On March 14, 1978, Israel launched first major invasion of
Lebanon with the claimed aim of avenging a raid by forces of the
Palestinian National Liberation Movement, the main guerrilla group
within the Palestinian Liberation Organization that headquartered
in south Lebanon at the time.
</P>
<P>
Four days later, the U.N. Security Council adopted the
resolution 425 calling for an immediate and unconditional Israeli
withdrawal from Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
After Palestinian guerrillas left Lebanon, Israel set up a
self-declared security zone in south Lebanon in 1985 to allegedly
prevent its north from Lebanese guerrillas' cross-border attacks.
</P>
<P>
Since then, Lebanon's resistance movement spearheaded by the
Iranian-backed Hezbollah has been fighting to evict Israeli
occupation forces and its ally South Lebanon Army out of the
country.
</P>
<P>
Many Israelis favor a unilateral Israeli withdrawal from
Lebanon, but the country's senior officials, including Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, insisted that a withdrawal must be
applied before a negotiated agreement with Lebanese government
over providing security guarantee for its north after the pullout.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon has rejected the offer, which was first made by Israel
last April, asking the Jewish state to fully comply with the
resolution 425 without any conditions.

<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, March 14 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopia announced that the
Ethiopian and Eritrean forces were fighting at Zalambessa-Egela
front Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Ethiopian News Agency quoted Sunday night the Office of
Ethiopian Government Spokesperson Selome Taddesse as saying that
"there was fighting today on the Zalambessa-Egela front" between
the Ethiopian defense forces and the Eritrean army.
</P>
<P>
The one-sentence report did not disclose details of the

</P>
<P>

Zalambessa on June 9, last year.
</P>
<P>
The Office of Ethiopian Government Spokesperson said in a

was an important achievement, it must not be forgotten that
thousands of Ethiopians continue to endure Eritrean occupation and
that sovereign Ethiopian territory still remains in Eritrean
hands."

<HEADLINE> Sudan Urged to Adopt Positive Foreign Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, March 14 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Presidential Political
Adviser Osama el-Baz Sunday called on Sudan to adopt "a positive
policy" toward other countries.
</P>
<P>
El-Baz made the call at a gathering at the Egyptian Cultural
Club, which was organized by Egypt's Former Prime Minister Abdel
Aziz Hegazi.
</P>
<P>
El-Baz said Egypt aspires for a "strong and stable" Sudan, one
that adopts "a positive foreign policy" toward neighboring
countries.
</P>
<P>
"Egypt wants an independent and strong Sudan, not a subordinate
one," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
"All what concerns Egypt is that the Sudanese government
changes its present policies that only express the will of a small
group within the Islamic Front under Hassan al Turabi," he said.
</P>
<P>
El-Baz maintained that the influence of al Turabi, speaker of
the Sudanese National Assembly (Parliament), on the government has
given rise to "dangerous and anti-Egypt policies."
</P>
<P>
"It is imperative" that Sudan restores its role in the region
and cooperation with neighboring countries, he said, adding
that "everything that is in the interest of Sudan is also in the
interest of Egypt."
</P>
<P>
The relations between Egypt and Sudan soured in 1995 after
Cairo accused Khartoum of masterminding an assassination attempt
on President Hosni Mubarak in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
Egypt also blamed Sudan for harboring Muslim extremists who
attempted to topple Mubarak's secular government and install a
strict Islamic rule.
</P>
<P>
Sudan has denied both charges.
</P>
<P>
There have been indications of a thaw in the relations between
Sudan and Egypt after the two Arab neighbors expressed willingness
and took steps to forge ahead reconciliation.

LUSAKA, March 14 (Xinhua) -- National Secretary of Zambia's
ruling party Michael Sata Sunday criticized the cadres of the
ruling Movement for Multi- Party Democracy (MMD) for going round
scandalizing the leadership of the party because of frustration.

He told them that MMD has no room for rumor mongers and people

He charged that most leaders including those at grass roots
level have failed to go round to explain to the people the
achievements of the MMD government including problems it has
encountered such as severe drought and heavy rainfall which has
destroyed crops.
</P>
<P>
Instead of going to the people to explain what the government
is doing they are in the forefront complaining just because they

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Calls for Equal Economic Order in 21st </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, March 14 (Xinhua) - Tanzanian President Benjamin
Mkapa Sunday urged the rich nations to cooperate with the poor in
an effort to create a competitive but equitable economic order as
the world enters the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
The economic and social justice are of great importance to the
development of the poor nations, Mkapa said, in an interview with
Diplomacy, a monthly magazine published in South Korea.
</P>
<P>
According to an official press release, Mkapa demanded that the
 international community not carry with it the "baggage of bad
things" of this century like wars and insecurity into the coming
century.
</P>
<P>
He expressed deep concern over the weak economies which are
often asked to open up to transnational conglomerates.
</P>
<P>
"But when the interests of the strong economies are at state
they impose restrictions," he said.
</P>
<P>
Mkapa observed that the free market by its nature always favors
the strong against the weak.
</P>
<P>
"To ask Tanzania to compete with the United States, for
instance, is a joke to say the least," the press release quoted
the president as saying.
</P>
<P>
On problems facing Tanzania, Mkapa said the challenges are not
political, social, security or lack of natural resources, but
development of financial, technical, and marketing capacity
necessary to transform those resources into tangible aspects of
economic growth.

well as our commitment to dialog, by attacking our towns and
villages, and by creating new stumbling blocks in the way of
peace, should never underestimate our determination to vigorously
maintain this two-track approach."

NAIROBI, March 15 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian President-elect Olusegun
Obasanjo Monday urged Kenyan businessmen to increase trade with

Trade and spoke at the conference before he left here for Cairo at

<HEADLINE> Singapore FM on Relations With Indonesia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, March 15 (Xinhua)-- Singapore Minister for Foreign
Affairs and Law S. Jayakumar affirmed Monday that his country will
continue to work with Indonesia, both bilaterally and within
ASEAN, to further strengthen relations to the benefit of both
countries.
</P>
<P>
In his remarks to Parliament Monday, Jayakumar said, "We will
establish rational and stable long-term relations with Indonesia
as we have done in the past 30 years, a relationship based on
mutual respect and equality between two independent countries."
</P>
<P>
Recalling recent developments in the relations between the two
neighbors, Jayakumar said Singapore first proposed Multilateral
Trade Finance Guarantee scheme to help Indonesia tide over the
crisis and after most Indonesia's trading partners preferred their
own bilateral schemes Singapore subsequently offered its own
Bilateral Trade Financing Guarantee scheme.
</P>
<P>
Singapore also announced in July 1998 humanitarian aid package
to Indonesia in the form of rice and medicines, he said.
</P>
<P>
Jayakumar said the current difficulties in Indonesia have also
not stopped his country from investing in Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
On criticism made against Singapore, Jayakumar conceded
relations between Singapore and Indonesia are going through a
difficult period as various leaders and officials have made
allegations and negative comments against Singapore.
</P>
<P>
"It is pointless to give detailed rebuttal of all the various
allegations that have been made in an off-hand manner without
supporting facts," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Let me restate that Singapore has a vested interest in
Indonesia's stability, growth and prosperity. Indonesia is a close
neighbor and a major trading partner. An Indonesian setback hurt
its neighbors, including Singapore," he said.
</P>
<P>
Quoting what Singapore Senior Minister lee Kuan Yew and Prime
Minister Goh Chok Tong commented recently on the allegations and
criticism against Singapore, Jayakumar said, "In the run-up to the
Indonesian parliamentary elections in June 1999 and the
presidential elections later this year, we can expect more
allegations to be directed against us."
</P>
<P>
"But we would avoid being drawn into their politics," he said.
"Singapore would try to avoid being a party in Indonesia's
domestic elections."
</P>
<P>
Jayakumar reaffirmed that the Singapore government is prepared
to work with whoever becomes the president of Indonesia and forms
the next government.

<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, March 15 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan and the United States
opened talks here Monday on ways and means to curb exports of
sensitive nuclear material to third country.
</P>
<P>
Official sources said that a three-member U.S. delegation met
Pakistan's Customs officials and those from the Central Board of
Revenue and discussed with them ways and means to tighten control
over exports of nuclear technology.
</P>
<P>
Details of the talks are not immediately available.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan said last Saturday it had issued a Statutory
Regulatory Order (SRO) to control the export of nuclear technology
to any foreign country.
</P>
<P>
The SRO reveals new regulations under which nuclear technology
can not be transferred to any other country without the no
objection certificate of the Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan detonated nuclear devices in May last year, and since
then the government has repeatedly said that Pakistan will not
transfer its nuclear technology to any other country.

<HEADLINE> Canada Deports More War Criminals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, March 15 (Xinhua) -- Canada has deported more than 20
torturers, death-squad members and corrupt officials from brutal
regimes in the last eight months as part of a crackdown on
suspected modern-day war criminals.
</P>
<P>
The Immigration Department is trying to change the country's
reputation as a safe haven for undesirables to a place where
vigilant officials hunt down and remove people with villainous
pasts, the National Post newspaper reported on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Craig Goodes, head of the department's war crimes unit, was
quoted as saying that about 200 of 400 old files have been
reviewed and about 200 new cases opened since last July, leaving
the department with a total of about 400 files still open.
</P>
<P>
Goodes said officials in Canadian posts in Central Africa and
the former Yugoslavia have also prevented about 40 suspected war
criminals from coming into Canada.
</P>
<P>
War crimes include murder, extermination, enslavement,
kidnapping and assault or robbery against a civilian population or
identifiable group of persons.
</P>
<P>
He said the Immigration Department is no longer content merely
to remove suspected war criminals who have already been identified,
but will ferret out those hiding in the community.
</P>
<P>
It's a lofty goal for a department that has come under fire in
recent years for failing to remove people suspected of torture and
murder.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, an internal report noted that 324 alleged modern-day
war criminals remained at large in Canada and only about 80 had
been removed in recent years.

<HEADLINE> Singapore FM on Relations With Malaysia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, March 15 (Xinhua) -- Singapore Minister for Foreign
Affairs and Law S. Jayakumar told Parliament Monday that bilateral
relations between Singapore and Malaysia improved following their
prime ministers met in November and December last year but
Singaporeans must expect ups and downs from time to time in the
relations between two the neighbors.
</P>
<P>
Jayakumar reiterated that Singapore is committed to forging a
long-term mutually beneficial relationship with Malaysia and will
manage bilateral ties on the basis of reciprocity and mutual
respect for each other's interests, stressing that the two
countries are bound by a multiplicity of complex ties and such
close relationship must inevitably go through different phases.
</P>
<P>
Spelling out recent developments in the bilateral relations,
Jayakumar said that relations between Singapore and Malaysia have
seen many ups and downs since the House discussed the issue on
June 29, 1998.
</P>
<P>
"We ran into a rough patch with the CIQ (Customs, Immigration
and Quarantine) issue in July 1998 when we rejected Malaysia's
claim to any legal right to locate its facilities in Tanjong
Pagar," he said.
</P>
<P>
He was referring to Malaysia's refusal to relocate its
facilities of Customs, Immigration and Quarantine from Tanjong
Pagar in southern Singapore to Singapore's northern tip town of
Woodlands as Singapore moved its own CIQ there.
</P>
<P>
Jayakumar also mentioned that Malaysia, without prior
notification, unilaterally revoked the Singapore air force's
access to Malaysian airspace given under earlier agreement
following the "furor in Malaysia" over the launch of Singapore
Senior Minister Lee Kuan Yew's memoirs.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister said that Singapore Prime Minister Goh
Chok Tong and Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohammad were
working towards concluding a "mutually beneficial water agreement
in return for our financial assistance from Singapore."
</P>
<P>
"At their last meeting in Hanoi on December 17, 1998, Mahathir
said that Malaysia no longer needed financial assistance from
Singapore and instead he proposed Singapore and Malaysia could
begin to discuss all outstanding bilateral issues, including the
long-term supply of water to Singapore, within an overall
package," He said
</P>
<P>
Jayakumar said both prime ministers then agreed that the
package would include issues like the withdrawal of West Malaysian
CPF (Central Provident Fund), the long-term supply of water to
Singapore, Malaysian company's land in Singapore, Singapore air
force's use of Malaysian airspace and the location of Malaysia's
CIQ facilities.
</P>
<P>
Singapore had informed the Malaysian side that before Singapore
could proceed to the negotiations on the package, Malaysia would
have to recognize Singapore's sovereignty and not claim that it
had legal right to operate its CIQ in Singapore, Jayakumar said.
</P>
<P>
According to the foreign minister, Malaysia sent to Singapore
on February 10 a paper which did not claim a legal right to
operate its customs and immigration facilities in Singapore and
Singapore replied on February 18, informing that Singapore was
ready to proceed with discussion on a package of outstanding
issues.
</P>
<P>
Senior officials from the two countries met on March 11 in
Singapore for discussion of items on the package of outstanding
issues.
</P>
<P>
Without disclosing the detail of the discussion, Jayakumar
said, "We are negotiating to arrive at a mutually beneficial
outcome."

<HEADLINE> African Meeting on Social Development Opens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, March 15 (Xinhua) -- Some 350 delegates from 24 east
and southern African countries gathered here to review the
progress made on social development since the Copenhagen World
Summit in 1995.
</P>
<P>
"The conference will provide an opportunity for countries to
share experiences, challenges and how countries have addressed the
problem of poverty," Kenyan Minister for Planning and National
Development George Saitoti said in his welcome address.
</P>
<P>
In the three-day meeting sponsored by the U.N. Economic
Commission for Africa (ECA) and United Nations Development Program
(UNDP), policy-makers, leaders of non-governmental and
inter-governmental organizations will scrutinize the progress in
reducing poverty, creating jobs, enhancing social integration and
fostering stable and just societies.
</P>
<P>
"Compared to the average annual rate of GDP growth of only one
percent for the two years preceding the Summit, the rate of GDP
growth increased to 3.2 percent as an average for the four years
after the summit," Deputy Executive Secretary Lalla Barka of the
ECA said.
</P>
<P>
"However, given Africa's high birth rate, these achievements
fall far short of the required growth rate to reduce poverty by
half by the year 2015. According to ECA's estimate, eight percent
for East Africa region and six percent for Southern Africa region
are required to achieve this objective," Barka said.
</P>
<P>
Studies show that poverty, unemployment, social disintegration,
 conflict and environmental degradation is on the increase in east
and southern Africa. The gap between the rich and the poor
continues to grow, with Africa accounting for a large percentage
of over one billion people in the world living in abject poverty.
</P>
<P>
At the World Summit in Copenhagen, Denmark, African countries
joined the rest of the world in proclaiming that they would give
social development a top priority among their national policies.

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 15 (Xinhua) -- Crime and violence continue
to drive South Africa's key specialists and managers out of the
country, according to the findings of an independent survey
released Monday.
</P>
<P>
The survey, conducted among over 55,000 employees from
organizations across the economic spectrum, showed that about 10
percent of turnover among specialists and management staff were
attributed to emigration.
</P>
<P>
Sixty percent of those who resigned to emigrate gave the crime
rate as a reason for emigration, and 47 percent cited violence,
according to the survey conducted by human resource consultants
FSA-Contact.
</P>
<P>
These were almost the same as last year's survey findings.
</P>
<P>
Falling living standards, health and education, affirmative
action policies in South Africa and better employment
opportunities abroad were also cited as reasons.
</P>
<P>
Most of those leaving, or 38 percent, emigrated to the United
States while 26 percent went to Britain, the survey showed.

PRISTINA, Kosovo, Yugoslavia, March 15 (Xinhua) -- Clashes
picked up again on Monday around Pristina as peace talks resumed
in Paris trying to bring peace back to the Yugoslav province.
</P>
<P>
Beatrice Lacoste, spokesperson of the Kosovo Verification
Mission from the Organization for Security and Cooperation in
Europe (OSCE), said there was fighting in the village of Lebane at
around high noon.
</P>
<P>
Lebane is within 20 minutes by car from the provincial capital,
where the press rushed only to see seven tanks and six armored
vehicles perching by the road and five truck loads of troops of
the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia were sent in as reinforcement.
</P>
<P>
The Pristina Media Center told the press that heavily-armed
separatists attacked the police station and Yugoslav army units
around Lebane and Luzane overnight with automatic weapons.
</P>
<P>
Yugoslav security forces returned fire and the fight lasted
from late Sunday night till early Monday morning, the Yugoslav
government information service said.
</P>
<P>
No casualties were reported from the government side.
</P>
<P>
In the past few days, as the continuation of the Kosovo peace
talks drew near, violent events like bomb blasts and arsenal
attacks increased, especially in northern and western Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday alone, clashes between Yugoslav forces and armed
separatists claimed the lives of at least 10 people in western
Kosovo, according to a press officer with the Kosovo Verification
Mission.

<HEADLINE> Rwandan PM Denies Genocide Charges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, March 15 (Xinhua) -- Rwandan Prime Minister Pierre
Celestin Rwigema has denied any involvement in the 1994 genocide,
the Rwanda News Agency (RNA) reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Rwigema said that some people had wanted to tarnish his image
which is generally good. He claimed that he himself is a
"genocide survivor,'' and that he ''narrowly escaped death" during
the 1994 genocide.
</P>
<P>
Talking to reporters recently, the prime minister blamed the
resurfacing of the accusations from his political foes in the
party, particularly four MPs who had been axed a week ago from
parliament on charges of high treason and fostering the Hutu
extremist ideology, reported the RNA, in a special story faxed to
Xinhua in Nairobi here.
</P>
<P>
More than 500,000 people in Rwanda, primarily Tutsis and
moderate Hutus, were brutally massacred in a genocide that took
place in April to June of 1994.
</P>
<P>
Rwigema defended himself saying that the allegations were
leveled by Amri Karekezi, the former head of Biryogo sector near
capital Kigali, who had allegedly stolen three vehicles of the
prime minister.
</P>
<P>
To seek vengeance, Karekezi had accused Rwigema of distributing
arms to the marauding Hutu gangs, and making lists of people to
kill, Rwigema said.
</P>
<P>
The issue of Rwigema's alleged involvement in the genocide has
raised a hot debate about some civil and military officials
suspected to have taken part in the genocide and other crimes
against humanity, which were committed in Rwanda in 1959 and in
the years which followed, but who are still free.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, there were reports saying that judicial sources in
Kigali that a file about the prime minister had been opened and
that investigations were nearing completion. However, government
sources said the reports were distorted.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued by the Minister of Information Augustin
Iyamuremye on Monday said that there was no case filed against the
prime minister.
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Pierre Celestin Rwigema was appointed to the post of prime
minister since August 1995 and is chairman of the Democratic
Republican (MDR) Party, since July 1998.  During all that time,
no judicial action was undertaken in the framework of genocide and
massacres which rocked Rwanda in 1994,'' he was quoted as saying.

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 15 (Xinhua) -- More than 14,200 children
were raped in South Africa in the first 11 months of 1998, or 43
children a day, police said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The rape figure had almost doubled since 1994, when about 7,500
cases were reported, according to figures released at a police
conference on crimes against children.
</P>
<P>
Another 3,450 children were indecently assaulted, and 1,100
were kidnapped, the figures showed.
</P>
<P>
Overall, more than 33,000 crimes against people under 18 were
recorded during the 11 months.
</P>
<P>
Police said they are training police social workers who could
assess children victims by therapeutic techniques, which enabled
them to give vital testimony to help convict the accused in sexual
offenses against children.
</P>
<P>
In the past, some of the accused were released because the
traumatized children could not provide sufficient evidence for a
conviction, police said.

<HEADLINE> EDS-Writethrough Premier Upset by Anti-China Current, Hopes for Good U.S. Trip </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 15 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji said
here today that despite an anti-China current emerging in the
United States, he is still looking forward to a successful trip to
the country early next month for the restoration of the good
momentum of the bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
Zhu made the remarks at a press conference here today following
the conclusion of the Second Session of the Ninth National People'
s Congress.
</P>
<P>
Sino-U.S. relations have been victimized by internal conflicts
in the United States, he pointed out, noting that he expects to
encounter some "hostile or unfriendly atmosphere" during his
coming visit to the United States.
</P>
<P>
"I noted that in the February 22 issue of Business Week, there
is an article titled: China, What's Going Wrong?" he said.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the Business Week article depicted China as being
plagued by serious disasters, Zhu said that the story is "very
special."
</P>
<P>
"So far I have never seen any other article of this kind
appearing in the U.S. media. In fact, it reflects the current. The
Sino-U.S. relations have been victimized by internal struggle in
the U.S.," he said.
</P>
<P>
Zhu said that under such an atmosphere, his trip to the United
States next month is aimed at presenting a true picture about
China and restoring the good momentum of a constructive strategic
partnership between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Zhu said jokingly that he himself is a victim of the bad
atmosphere in the United States, because a photo at the cover of
the Business Week makes him "look like a dead man."
</P>
<P>
Zhu said he is fully aware that under such a bad atmosphere his
task during the trip will not be easy, and some media predicted
that his trip could not possibly be successful.
</P>
<P>
"But I will continue to go on this trip," he said, adding that
since some people in the United States have anger and complaints,
he would let them to vent their anger and complaints.
</P>
<P>
On the so-called "spy case" in which China has allegedly
obtained nuclear secrets from the United States, he said it is
like a tale from the Arabian Nights.
</P>
<P>
"I think that on this issue some Americans have made two
mistakes due to underestimation," he said, noting that those
Americans have underestimated the ability of the United States to
keep secret.
</P>
<P>
The Los Alamos Lab has a very strict control system to keep
secret and so far no evidence has been found to support the
allegation that Wen Ho Lee had stolen military secrets, Zhu said.

<P>
Those Americans have also underestimated China's ability in
research and development of military technology, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese people are very intelligent and diligent, Zhu said,
adding that "China is now fully capable of developing any kind of
military technology and it is only a matter of time."
</P>
<P>
"So, why should we put ourselves under political and moral
risks to steal military technology?" he asked.
</P>
<P>
However, Zhu said that the United States has overestimated the
so-called "threat."
</P>
<P>
"Since all the most sophisticated weapons are originated from
the Unites States, what does it need for the United States to be
afraid of?" he asked.
</P>
<P>
Zhu said he believes that during his forthcoming visit to the
United States, he could get a warm welcome instead of "walking
into a minefield."

<HEADLINE> People's Daily Hails Success of NPC Session (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 15 (Xinhua) -- The Tuesday issue of the People's
Daily, China's leading newspaper, will carry an editorial marking
the successful conclusion of the Second Session of the Ninth
National People's Congress (NPC), China's top legislature.
</P>
<P>
The editorial, titled "Be united as one and make pragmatic
efforts to invigorate the country", describes the just-concluded
NPC session as a "democratic, united, truth-seeking and inspiring"
meeting.
</P>
<P>
With a high sense of responsibility for the people and the
nation, the nearly 3,000 NPC deputies attending the session
examined a Government Work Report and a draft amendment to China's
Constitution, deliberated and approved the 1999 plan for China's
economic and social development and the 1999 budgets, and examined
other important reports and draft laws, says the editorial.
</P>
<P>
"They have made active efforts to ensure the success of the
work in various fields this year and to further promote the
country's economic growth and social progress," it adds.
</P>
<P>
The editorial points to the fact that the Constitutional
amendment adopted by the NPC session has endorsed Deng Xiaoping
Theory as China's guiding ideology, enshrined the principle of "
governing the country according to law", and defined the country's
fundamental economic and distribution systems, thus turning the
guidelines of the 15th National Congress of the Communist Party of
China (CPC) into the will of the state through the legal procedure.
</P>
<P>
"This is in keeping with the aspirations of people of all
ethnic groups across the country and with our country's
fundamental situation of being at the primary stage of socialism,
which will last for a long period of time," the editorial says,
adding that the amendment also represents the biggest success for
the principle of "seeking truth from facts."

The revised Constitution will have an important and far-
reaching significance to the Chinese people's efforts to hold
higher the great banner of Deng Xiaoping Theory, rally more
closely around the CPC Central Committee with Jiang Zemin at its
core, adhere to the Party's basic line at the primary stage of
socialism, and build China into a modernized socialist country
which is prosperous, powerful, democratic and has highly developed
culture and ethics, it adds.
</P>
<P>
The editorial goes on to say that the most important thing at
present is to implement the NPC session's guidelines and
arrangements, and guide all officials and people to concentrate on
and work enthusiastically for the accomplishment of various tasks
set forth by the central authorities.
</P>
<P>
"We must continue to promote reforms and opening-up, make a
great effort to implement the strategy of invigorating the nation
through science and education and the strategy of sustainable
development, take expanding the domestic demand as the major
measure to drive the economic growth, stabilize and strengthen
agricultural work, deepen the reform of the state enterprises, do
a good job of the financial reform so as to prevent and defuse
financial crisis, readjust economic structure and straighten out
the economic order, maintain the sustainable, fast and healthy
development of the national economy, intensify our efforts to
promote the building of democratic legal system and the cultural
and ethic progress," it says.
</P>
<P>
"We must ensure social and political stability, promote a
comprehensive social advancement, and strive for outstanding
achievements in the reform, opening-up and socialist modernization
drive, so as to greet the 50th founding anniversary of the People'
s Republic of China and Macao's return to the motherland," it
urges.

<HEADLINE> Latin American Economies Grow by 2.5 Percent in 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 15 (Xinhua) -- The Asian and Russian
financial crises and falling commodity prices, compounded by
natural disasters, took their toll in Latin America in 1998,
resulting in a slowdown of growth to 2.5 percent compared to 5.2
percent in 1997, the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) said on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
In its 1998 Annual Report, the Washington-based IDB blamed the
slowdown on such negative factors as reduced exports and capital
inflows, as well as higher interest rates.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the report said the "fundamentals for future growth
remained solidly in place; not only was macroeconomic stability
preserved, but a commitment to market refrom was maintained, and
even deepened, in the region."
</P>
<P>
Inflation remained under control, at a median rate of less than
10 percent, on a par with 1997, and "fiscal and monetary policies
were aimed at curtailing the fiscal imbalances and preventing
foreign exchange disequilibria," the report said.
</P>
<P>
During the IDB's 40th Annual Meeting scheduled for March 15-17
in Paris, France, its board of governors will review the Annual
Report as well as analyze the evolution of the region's economies
and their financial needs.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, Ecuador and Venezuela were particularly hard hit by
the fall in oil prices and Chile's export revenues declined 14
percent, or 3 percent of the country's gross domestic product, as
a result of falling commodity prices, mainly copper, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
Total capital inflows to the region dropped to 64 billion U.S.
dollars in 1998 compared to 79 billion dollars the previous year,
and the "yield on Latin American debt issues in the Euro-markets
doubled between July and September from 456 basis points to 900
points. Toward the end of the year, the average yield had fallen
substantially, but was still above its initial level."
</P>
<P>
"Uncertainty and volatility pushed interest rates upwards," the
report said. "By October, interest rates had practically doubled
in several countries with respect to the levels observed in late
1997."
</P>
<P>
Among the other repercussions in the region were falling
international reserves, rising public sector deficits, falling
stock markets values, and the tightening of fiscal policies.
</P>
<P>
Latin America and the Caribbean continued on the path of reform
despite the shocks, the report said. Tariff codes changed little
during the crisis and the "commitment to economic integration with
the rest of the world was maintained." Several countries
strengthened financial supervision and regulation and introduced
major tax reforms, and privatization continued, although "at a
move moderate pace than previous years."
</P>
<P>
Assessing the outlook, the report said the region could benefit
from "expected improvement in Asian performance" as well as growth
in the United States and Europe, although "the possibility of new
eruptions cannot be dismissed." Because of depressed levels of
commodity prices, "continued fiscal and monetary prudence will
certainly be key factors," the report said.
</P>
<P>
Reviewing the IDB's lending activities in 1998, the report said
that the bank "responded quickly and effectively" with a record 10
billion dollars in lending to help the region counteract natural
catastrophes and world economic challenges. Disbursements also
reached a new record of 6.6 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The report said that for the fifth consecutive year the IDB
"remained the region's main source of multilateral credit,
bolstering the Latin American and Caribbean economies in their
effort to alleviate poverty, build infrastructure and increase
productivity, support the private sector, and reform
institutions."

<HEADLINE> Malaysia to Adopt Smart Farming </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, March 15 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Primary Industries
Minister Lim Keng Yaik Monday stressed the need for the country to
adopt smart farming in order to ease agricultural work load which
he said is imposing a burden on the government.
</P>
<P>
Smart farming means agricultural activities combined with
knowledge and information.
</P>
<P>
Agriculture with knowledge would increase a plantation's
expertise for maximum production with minimum cost and is
environment-friendly, he said at the National Conference on
"Engineering Smart Farming Towards the Next Millennium" here.
</P>
<P>
Lim said that with the implementation of smart farming,
economies of scale was greatly needed, and as such efforts towards
the enlargement of agricultural areas through the integration of
smaller-sized lands, creation of estates and group work needed to
be carried out to ensure an effective operation.
</P>
<P>
He said that to realize the smart farming concept, the
development of human resources was also important and farmers
should be given adequate training.
</P>
<P>
The minister called upon private and public sector training
institutes to play their role in training farmers and plantation
managers so that agricultural programs and activities planned
could be implemented effectively.
</P>
<P>
The agricultural sector not only produces food but also
non-food products like rubber, Lim said, adding that in 1998,
Malaysia exported commodities and commodities-based goods worth
49.8 million ringgit (13.105 million U.S. dollars), an increase of
30.7 percent from the previous year, and amounting to 17.4
percent of the country's total exports.
</P>
<P>
But in the food sector, Malaysia had to import foodstuffs worth
more than 10 billion ringgit (2.631 billion U.S. dollars) in 1998,
Lim said.

<HEADLINE> Iran to Cut Oil Production </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, March 15 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Oil Minister Bijan Namdar
Zanganeh announced here Monday that Iran is to reduce its oil
output ceiling in line with the recent agreement reached by major
oil producers.
</P>
<P>
However, Zanganeh did not specify the amount his country would
reduce. Iran currently produces more than 3.6 million barrels each
day, above its 3.3-million-barrels-per-day quota set by the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) last year.
</P>
<P>
According to the official Islamic Republic News Agency, the
minister said all the OPEC members but Iraq would cut about 22.9
million barrels of crude per day following the reduction decision.
</P>
<P>
Four major oil producers, Saudi Arabia, Iran, Venezuela and
Mexico, agreed Friday in Amsterdam, the Netherlands, to cut their
output ceiling by more than 2 million barrels per day in an
attempt to bolster oil prices. The accords takes effect on April 1.
</P>
<P>
Prior to this, Iran compromised on March 7 after months of
wrangling with Saudi Arabia, agreeing to make any further
production cuts from its current output of 3.6 million barrels a
day.
</P>
<P>
It had argued that 3.925 million barrels per day should be
recognized as the baseline for any cuts.
</P>
<P>
The new initiative on production cuts ended a year-long oil
price slump and reports said that benchmark Brent crude rose to
13.8 U.S. dollars on Monday from 12-year lows.
</P>
<P>
Zanganeh said the period for enforcement of the agreement would
be set by the OPEC members in their future session on March 23.
The OPEC members have reached the conclusion that adoption of
joint measures is more important than engaging in disputes, he
said.
</P>
<P>
He expressed hope that recent agreement would help stabilize
the oil market through creating a balance between output and
demand.
</P>
<P>
The stability of oil market, from both long-term and short-term
views, will be in the interests of the oil producing countries,
the minister said.
</P>
<P>
The recent agreement is hailed here as heralding the end of the
"fourth oil shock," which started in 1997 and worsened in 1998 due
to a glut in OPEC output, coupled with slacken demands and the
financial crisis in southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
Some oil experts here predict that oil price can reach as high
as 20 dollars per barrel if the agreement would be observed by the
OPEC members in 1999.

<P>
BEIJING, March 15 (Xinhua) -- The Everbright Bank of China (EBC)
has had rapid growth since it became a joint-stock bank in early
1997, sources close to the bank say.
</P>
<P>
Everbright was founded in 1992 and has 18 branches and more
than 100 offices across China and more than 700 offices in 65
countries and regions. At the end of 1998, its total assets
amounted to 74.7 billion yuan, net capital to 6.1 billion yuan,
and savings deposits amounted to 49.3 billion yuan,
</P>
<P>
EBC is tied to China Everbright Holding Co. Ltd. as a holding
company. Other major stockholders include the Asian Development
Bank, China Tobacco Corporation's Yunnan branch, and China
Construction Group Ltd.
</P>
<P>
Observers attribute the sustained growth of EBC to its
operations and comprehensive supervision system that exercises
strict control over loans and liabilities. It has attempted to
expand its business by shifting loans to state-backed
infrastructure construction and enterprises with a good record.
</P>
<P>
The bank has committed itself to providing round-the-clock

<P>
DHAKA, March 15 (Xinhua) -- Senior Vice President and chief
economist of the World Bank (WB) Joseph Stiglitz ended his
three-day visit to Bangladesh Monday after discussing financial
reform and other issues with Bangladeshi officials and scholars.
</P>
<P>
"There is no simple formula, no single recipe...what is
required is balance," Stiglitz said at one of his public lectures
on economic development in Bangladesh.
</P>
<P>
"The state should have more than a minimalist role, but less
than an all-encompassing role," he said. "The private sector still
should be the focus of development with the government providing
appropriate institutional infrastructure."
</P>
<P>
At a press conference here Monday afternoon, Stiglitz said that
the non-governmental organizations in Bangladesh play an important
role in improving the life of the poor people.
</P>
<P>
"The commitment to reform (of the Bangladeshi government) is
essential to development," and "competition within and outside the
government should be promoted," which was essential to success, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Finance Minister Shah A.M.S. Kibria said that the relations
between the Bangladesh and the WB were the best at present. The
commitment of loans of the WB to Bangladesh this year was about 1
billion U.S. dollars, he added.

fuel in the country's efforts to prevent forest depletion and
preserve the nation's forests and environment.
</P>
<P>
A factory has been set up in Yangon by the Myanmar Forestry
Ministry to produce briquette and its extension use as a firewood
substitute fuel is being pushed.
</P>
<P>
Such factories are also planned for other divisions like
Sagaing, Mandalay and Magway divisions where arid districts lie.
</P>
<P>
Firewood, along with charcoal, has been used in Myanmar with an
annual consumption of more than 24 million tons.
</P>
<P>
Indiscriminate felling and cutting of trees including firewood
plantations for fuel and burning of charcoal have been known as
the cause of forest depletion in Myanmar.
</P>
<P>
The country has worked out projects for greening the arid
districts under which revival of firewood plantations is among the
measures taken.
</P>
<P>
To prevent forest depletion, Myanmar also applies micro-wave
ovens and agricultural wastes for fuel.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar once designated 1995 as the Firewood Substitute Fuel
Year and progress was reportedly made in the implementation plan,
while endeavors were then made for greening of the nine arid
districts.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar's forest area is reducing year after year, dropping by
7 percent compared with 36 years ago. The 1962 data showed that 57
percent of the country's total area was then covered by forests.
The percentage dropped to 50 in 1998.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar Seeks Manila Support for Attending EU-ASEAN Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 15 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Myanmar Foreign Minister
Win Aung is expected to meet Philippine Vice President Gloria
Arroyo and other officials to seek support for Myanmar's
participation in an EU-ASEAN meeting, government officials said
here Monday.
</P>
<P>
Win Aung arrived here Sunday for a three-day official visit.
</P>
<P>
Win Aung already met his Philippine counterpart Domingo Siazon
late Sunday. His meeting with Vice President Arroyo and other
officials have also been arranged, officials said.
</P>
<P>
After Sunday's meeting with Siazon, the Myanmar minister told
reporters that members of the Association of Southeast Asian
Nations (ASEAN) should remain tightly united.
</P>
<P>
The ASEAN "won't be complete without a member," he said.
</P>
<P>
"If ASEAN is united, nobody could come and then make a wedge
between us," he added. "We should stick together come what may."
</P>
<P>
Siazon said that "what is being requested is to discriminate
against an ASEAN member, which is unthinkable."
</P>
<P>
Siazon also said that the meeting between the ASEAN and the
European Union (EU) has been canceled.
</P>
<P>
However, he added, Thai Foreign Minister Surin Pitsuwan is
negotiating with the EU in an attempt to reach a compromise that
would allow the meeting to proceed as scheduled in Berlin,
Germany, on March 30.
</P>
<P>
The EU has opposed Myanmar's inclusion in the meeting of the
ASEAN and European foreign ministers in Germany.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar joined the ASEAN in 1997 along with Laos. Other members
of the ASEAN are Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines,
Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
Win Aung's Southeast Asia tour will also take him to Vietnam
and Laos at the conclusion of his visit to the Philippines.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Man Gets 7 Years For Copyright Infringement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 15 (Xinhua) -- A court in the Chinese capital
today sentenced a man to 7 years in jail for copyright
infringement, the heaviest sentence ever handed down for this
crime in China.
</P>
<P>
The man, Dai Guanghao, was also fined 150,000 yuan by the
Beijing First Intermediate People's Court, which found him guilty
of illegally printing more than 155,00 sets of the Chinese
Children's Encyclopedia at a printing factory in the Beijing
suburbs.
</P>
<P>
Dai sold about 10,000 sets of the books for some 2.3 million
yuan. The remainder were confiscated by the court.
</P>
<P>
In related events, a farmer from east China's Anhui Province
was sentenced by the same court to 15 years in prison for
smuggling pornographic discs.
</P>
<P>
Li Qingtao was caught by police with 2,500 pornographic discs
on November 6, 1998. The police later found 3,500 more discs in
his house.
</P>
<P>
According to official sources, Beijing authorities have
confiscated 8,600 copies of illegal publications and 100,000
illegal discs since early March and have arrested at least 10
people in the drive against illegal publishing.

Chen Jianhua, A CCA official told reporters that since 1987

Chen said that this year's theme is "safe and healthy consuming
" and that similar activities are being held today in other parts
of China.
</P>
<P>
According to Chen, with consumer awareness of the law gradually
increasing, consumer complaints have changed. They used to focus
on the inferior quality of daily necessities and food and drinks
but now the number of complaints about bad service, housing, and
medical care are on the rise.
</P>
<P>
There were more than 5 million people who used the law to
protect their rights last year and 1.52 billion yuan (183 million

<HEADLINE> Asia's Oldest Air Carrier Celebrates 58th Anniversary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 15 (Xinhua) -- Flag carrier Philippine Airlines
(PAL) Monday marked its 58th anniversary which coincides with
another milestone in its climb back to full recovery - the
deadline for the submission of a revised rehabilitation plan to
the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).
</P>
<P>
The company considers the twin events - its birth anniversary
and the submission for the approval of the new recovery plan -
significant because the plan "carries the seeds of our future
growth and success."
</P>
<P>
In a special message to the company officials and employees,
Lucio Tan, PAL chairman, said, "We are confident that today will
be a turning point in the history of PAL."
</P>
<P>
The past year was the most difficult in the history of Asia's
oldest air carrier, having to be closed for a brief spell because
of financial crunch brought about by internal problems aggravated
by the Asian financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
"The trails of the past year are still fresh in our minds as we
mark our anniversary today. I take this occasion to express my
heartfelt gratitude for your selfless efforts to keep PAL flying,
particularly during its most difficult hours," Tan added.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, the country's flag carrier hit its lowest bottom. PAL
witnessed some of the most turbulent events in its history:
strikes, financial crisis, receivership, creditor lawsuits,
management changes and a 13-day shutdown that blemished its long
record of uninterrupted service to the nation.
</P>
<P>
The start of the campaign to fight back and return to
profitability was signaled by the recent streamlining of the
airline's organizational structure into three major groups --
commercial, operations and finance -- to make it "lean and mean."

<HEADLINE> Khatami: Iran Ready to Mediate in Karabakh Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, March 15 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Mohammad
Khatami Monday said Tehran is ready to help find a solution to the
Azerbaijan-Armenia dispute over Nargono-Karabakh.
</P>
<P>
Khatami made the remark in a meeting with visiting Azeri
Foreign Minister Tofik Zulfugarov, the Islamic Republic News
Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
He said that disputes among regional states would provide an
excuse for the presence of alien powers in the region, which are
causes for many crises.
</P>
<P>
Azerbaijan and Armenia have been at odds over the sovereignty
of Nargono-Karabakh, an enclave inside Azerbaijan populated by
ethnic Armenians.
</P>
<P>
The two former Soviet republics reached a cease-fire agreement
in 1994 with the mediation of the international community. But
tension still exists between the two countries as peace talks have
failed to solve the issues.
</P>
<P>
Khatami also voiced Iran's readiness for cooperation in the
creation of stability and security in the region.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the Caspian Sea issue, the Iranian president said
the Caspian belongs to all littoral countries and a suitable
solution should be found through negotiations to exploit the
resources.
</P>
<P>
Zulfugarov praised Iran's efforts towards the settlement of the
crisis between Azerbaijan and Armenia and for its humanitarian
assistance to the people of his country.
</P>
<P>
Zulfugarov, who arrived here on Saturday, expressed Azeri
government's willingness to strengthen and expand relations with
Iran.

<HEADLINE> Singapore FM on Strategic Situation in Asia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, March 15 (Xinhua) -- Singapore Minister for Foreign
Affairs and Law S. Jayakumar Monday told the Parliament that there
is some basis for cautious optimism over the situation in Asia,
saying that "the fundamentals and infrastructure that made
possible three decades of growth are still there."
</P>
<P>
Giving an overview of strategic situation in Asia, Jayakumar
said, "Fortunately, the U.S.-China-Japan triangular relationship
has remained relatively stable."
</P>
<P>
"Stability in the triangular relationship will continue to
provide the basic foundation for peace and security in the
region," he added.
</P>
<P>
Touching on the U.S.-China relations, Jayakumar said the first
half of 1998 saw U.S.-China relations "stabilizing to a
comfortable balance" following Chinese President Jiang Zemin's
visit to the U.S. in November 1997.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton made a return visit to China in
June 1998, he noted.
</P>
<P>
But there are now signs of traditional problems resurfacing and
underlying differences have once again been brought to fore, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Jayakumar stressed that "a downturn in U.S.-China relations
would not be in the interest of either party, nor of the region as
a whole".
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that the U.S.-China relations can settle
on a more even keel after Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji's visit to
the U.S. in April.
</P>
<P>
On U.S.-Japan relations, Jayakumar said there was a perception
that U.S.-Japan relations suffered a slide but Clinton's visit to
Japan in November 1998 restored relations to an even keel.
</P>
<P>
He also noted that there is friction in economic and trade
relations between the U.S. and Japan.
</P>
<P>
Citing that Chinese President Jiang Zemin made an historic
state visit to Japan in November 1998, Jayakumar said China
remains high on Japan's foreign policy agenda. But he added that
it will take time for the two countries to forge a closer
relationship.
</P>
<P>
Jayakumar said the economic crisis has altered the regional
strategic landscape as many economies have been affected,
triggering political changes and instability in several countries.
</P>
<P>
"We have therefore to be alert to possible instability and be
prepared for political upheaval in the region," he emphasized.
</P>
<P>
Jayakumar said it is in the interest of Singapore to have a
stable and peaceful balance of power in the region.
</P>
<P>
He also said Singapore welcomes a strong European engagement in
the region, saying "Europe should complement its economic
involvement in the region with a greater strategic presence."

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 15 (Xinhua) -- A symposium on Japanese
assistance to China and technological co-operation with China,
sponsored by China's Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic
Cooperation and Ministry of Science and Technology, the Japanese
Embassy in China, and the Japan International Co-operation Agency,
opened in Beijing today.
</P>
<P>
Government officials, scholars, and company representatives
from China and Japan discussed policies and strategy for funding
and technological co-operation and project management. The
participants said that funding should be connected to
technological co-operation more closely to ensure that projects
are more efficient.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1997, Japan had provided 158 billion yuan in
government loans to China, 8.1 billion yuan in free assistance,
and 7.6 billion yuan in financing for technological co-operation,
mainly for infrastructure, agriculture, environmental protection,
medical care, and health, education, and personnel training.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, the Japanese government has been shifting
assistance to China's central and western parts for poverty relief.

<HEADLINE> Singapore Holds First Meeting on Women in Sports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, March 15 (Xinhua) -- Singapore Monday opened its
first national conference on women and sports in an effort to
highlight the current status of sport for women in the country.
</P>
<P>
The Women and Sports Conference 1999, with the theme "Women &AMP;
Sports: New Horizons", will focus on the barriers and mindsets
which are keeping more women and girls from taking part in sports
and exercises.
</P>
<P>
The participation rate in sports and exercise for women in
Singapore in comparison with men is low, said Ms Annabel Ess,
chairperson of the conference, in her opening address.
</P>
<P>
Only 28 percent of women in Singapore competed regularly in
sports in 1997, lagging far behind 40 percent of males, according
to official statistics.
</P>
<P>
That is not a unique Singaporean problem, but part of a
worldwide trend, said Annabel, adding that many of the barriers to
women's participation in sports in other countries were not
present in modern Singapore society.
</P>
<P>
Teo Chee Hean, Education Minister and President of the
Singapore National Olympic Council, told the conference that
Singapore women have certainly made progress in sports, both at
the national and international levels, but much can be done to
improve the situation.
</P>
<P>
He stressed the role of women in positively influencing their
families towards sports.
</P>
<P>
Delegates from Australia, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia,
Philippines, Thailand, Vietnam, the United States and other
countries are attending the two-day conference.

<HEADLINE> Nepal Ruling Party Accepts Election Schedule </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, March 15 (Xinhua) -- The ruling Communist Party of
Nepal (United Marxism-Leninism, CPN-UML) hinted here Monday that
it would accept the Election Commission's decision to hold the May
general elections in two phases.
</P>
<P>
CPN-UML General Secretary Madav Kumar Nepal told a press
conference that though the decision is unconstitutional, his party
accepts it since no one has challenged it constitutionally.
</P>
<P>
The party had vehemently opposed the idea of phase-wise
election to the House of Representatives and demanded instead
election in one single day on May 3 as announced by King Birendra
when he dissolved the House on January 15.
</P>
<P>
All the other parties except the ruling Nepali Congress echoed.
But the Election Commission has decided to hold the polls in two
phases on May 3 and May 17, citing inadequate security personnel.
</P>
<P>
The CPN-UML also released its election manifesto at the press
conference, which calls for voting for the party to make a
majority government for political stability, good governance,
development and national pride and dignity.
</P>
<P>
The manifesto, among others, pledges further investigation into
the mysterious death of former party general secretary Madan
Bhandari.
</P>
<P>
The Mitsubishi Pajero jeep which Bhandari and another CPN-UML
leader Jeeva Raj Ashrit took fell into a river in May 1993 in
Chitwan district of central Nepal. They died but the driver
survived. The case remains a mystery.
</P>
<P>
The manifesto said the investigation has been left incomplete;
the process of investigation and unmasking the culprits will be
sped up.
</P>
<P>
It also pledges to take initiatives to extradite Indian armies
from Kalapani in far-western Nepal and regulate borders between
the two countries on the basis of historical and authenticated
facts.

such tablets by Thailand in 1997-98 fiscal year; the seizure of
more than 28,000 kilos of opium and over 4,000 kilos of heroin as

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, March 15 (Xinhua) -- Indian Prime Minister Atal
Behari Vajpayee said Monday that since both India and Pakistan
have nuclear weapons, they have to live together to pursue peace.
</P>
<P>
In a reply to the debate in the Lower House of Parliament here
on the motion of thanks on the president's address to the joint
session of the two Houses on February 22, Vajpayee said, "We both
are now having nuclear arms with us. There is no option but to
live together. Nuclear arms are for protection and not for
attacking each other."
</P>
<P>
He said that India and Pakistan had fought three wars in the
past and a "permanent solution" had to be found to prevent
conflict. "There is no other way but to have a political
dialogue," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
While resolving pending outstanding issues, steps were being
initiated to improve trade and economic cooperation between India
and Pakistan. Besides, visa restrictions were being relaxed and
efforts were on to secure the release of captured fishermen and
return of prisoners of war by the two countries, he further said.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam Proposes More Barter Trade With ASEAN, CIS </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, March 15 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam's Trade Ministry has asked
Prime Minister Phan Van Khai to allow local businesses to barter
goods with ASEAN countries and the Commonwealth of Independent
States (CIS)to promoted exports this year, official media here
reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The export items would include mechanical products,
handicrafts, rubber, electrical-electronic appliances, garments,
footwear, pharmaceuticals, salt, seafood, meat, milk and animal
products as well as other agricultural products, excluding rice
and coffee.
</P>
<P>
These would be bartered for motorbike components, fertilizers,
steel, clinker, ashlartiles and sanitary ware, construction glass
and electric fans.
</P>
<P>
An official with the ministry's Import-Export Division said
barter trade would promote exports to countries which had become
major markets for Vietnam in the last five years.
</P>
<P>
Last year, exports to these markets slumped due to the regional
economic crisis and the financial turmoil in the CIS.
</P>
<P>
Exports of pork to Russia came to a standstill last year. In
early 1998, Vietnam signed a contract to supply Russia with 2.5
million tons of pork. However, only a few thousand tons were
actually delivered.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia's Sabah State New Chief Minister Sworn In </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, March 15 (Xinhua) -- New chief minister Osu Sukam
of Malaysia's Sabah state was sworn in Monday to head the new
state government led by the Barisan Nasional (BN) (National
Front).
</P>
<P>
He took his oath of office before Sabah's head of state Sakaran
Dandai in Sabah's capital city of Kota Kinabalu, according to
reports reaching here.
</P>
<P>
Osu Sukam was sworn in as the 11th chief minister of Sabah,
East Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
Osu Sukam, the ruling United Malays National Organization
(UMNO) Sabah chief, was named the state's new chief minister
earlier in the day, Malaysia's Deputy Prime Minister Abdullah
Ahmad Badawi said at a news conference in Kota Kinabalu.
</P>
<P>
Osu, 50, took over from Bernard Dompok who was defeated in the
ninth Sabah state Legislative Assembly election held on Friday and
Saturday, to head the new BN state government which was returned
to a resounding victory in the polls.
</P>
<P>
The BN won the polls with 31 seats out of 48 seats at stake.
UMNO is the backbone of the ruling BN.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah also announced that Osu would serve his term under the
rotation system introduced when the BN came to power in the state
in 1994 and would be succeeded by a leader of the Kadazandusun
community (non-Muslim) in the Sabah BN and then of the Chinese
community.
</P>
<P>
The rotation system of the chief ministership would be
continued in line with the BN concept of power sharing in the
state, Abdullah said.
</P>
<P>
Under the rotation system for the Sabah chief minister's post,
Dompok who represented the non-Muslim Bumiputera (aboriginals)
community, was appointed the state's chief minister last year to
replace Yong Teck Lee who represented the Chinese community.
</P>
<P>
The first chief minister under the rotation system was Salleh
Tun Said who represented the Muslim bumiputera (aboriginals).
</P>
<P>
Osu's appointment marks the completion of the first round of
the rotation system and the beginning of a fresh one.
</P>
<P>
Osu was Deputy Chief Minister and Finance Minister in the
previous state government headed by Dompok.
</P>
<P>
Osu was federal Minister of Land and Cooperative Development
from 1994 to 1998.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar to Sell 17.52 Million Dollars Worth of Gems </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, March 15 (Xinhua) -- A total of 17.52 million U.S.
dollars worth of locally produced gems, jade, pearl and jewelry
will be sold at the 36th annual Myanmar Gems Emporium due to open
here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
These items will be sold through competitive bidding at the
six-day state-sponsored gems emporium, said Myanmar Deputy
Minister of Mine U Myint Thein at a press briefing here Monday.
</P>
<P>
Over 300 merchants of 114 companies from 16 countries and
regions are expected to attend the emporium.
</P>
<P>
At the 35th emporium held in March last year, a total of 3.15
million U.S. dollars worth of these items were sold. The emporium
attracted 239 merchants of 161 companies from seven countries and
regions including Japan, Thailand, China and China's Hong Kong
Special Administrative Region.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Myanmar also added a mid-year gems emporium in last

<HEADLINE> Chinese Premier on Bankruptcy of GITIC (More Added) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 15 (Xinhua)-- The application by the Guangdong
International Trust and Investment Corporation (GITIC) for
bankruptcy has sent a significant message to the outside world
that the Chinese government will not repay debts for any
individual financial institutions that are not guaranteed by the
government, China's premier Zhu Rongji said at a press conference
here today.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the bankruptcy of GITIC as an individual case in
the course of the financial reform in China, the premier said,
adding that "this incidence is of great significance because it
has sent a message to the world that the Chinese government will
not repay the debts for the financial institution or a financial
firm if the debts are not guaranteed by governments at various
levels in China".
</P>
<P>
Zhu made the remark at a press conference which was held right
after the conclusion of the Second Session of the Ninth National
People's Congress.
</P>
<P>
Zhu said that that the foreign banks and institutions need to
make risk analysis and act prudently and cautiously in extending
loans to financial firms in China.
</P>
<P>
"I think that the approach of China in approving the bankruptcy
of GITIC is consistent with the principle of financial reform, and
also consistent with intentional practice," he said.
</P>
<P>
Zhu pointed out that "the creditor banks and financial
institutions have been too pessimistic in their estimation and
evaluation of this incident" to think that China is experiencing a
financial crisis, has no repayment capability, and is no longer
credit-worthy.
</P>
<P>
He said that China is maintaining a rapid economic growth and
has 1,46.5 billion U.S. dollars of foreign exchange reserves, and
balanced international payments.
</P>
<P>
"China is fully capable of repaying its debts, but the question
is whether the debts should be repaid by the government, the
answer is, of course, they should not," he added.
</P>
<P>
Zhu also pointed out that even though the bankruptcy is lawful,
reasonable and fair, one should not assume that one can benefit
from the bankruptcy, and one should not rush for a bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
"I do not expect to see too many bankruptcies of financial
firms in the future, and maybe there will be none." he stressed.
</P>
<P>
But, he warned, the precondition is that the creditor banks
should not press too hard for the debt repayment beforehand or in
advance. "If you press too hard, they will have no choice but to
apply for bankruptcy," he said.
</P>
<P>
If everybody can just sit down and have a talk according to
international practice, for instance, to recapitalize the firm or
to instill fresh capital into it or to swap the debt for equity,
then the problem can be settled and there is no need to apply for
bankruptcy, Zhu said.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia, Poland to Expand Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, March 15 (Xinhua) -- Polish President Aleksander
Kwasniewski said here Monday his country was satisfied with its
political relations with Malaysia but was interested in expanding
further bilateral economic and trade ties.
</P>
<P>
"Political dialogues between the two countries are proceeding
very well and Poland desires to maintain the process," he told a
press conference here after his talks with Malaysian Prime
Minister Mahathir Mohamad.
</P>
<P>
However, he said Poland was interested in extending and
expanding the scope of economic and trade cooperation between the
two countries.
</P>
<P>
Though bilateral trade expanded in recent years, there are
still "great potentials" for expansion in this field, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that based on the talks held Monday, there is goodwill
on both sides to expand bilateral economic and trade cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Both sides talked about establishing direct air link between
Poland and Malaysia to the convenience of businessmen of both
sides, he said.
</P>
<P>
The two countries also expressed the desire to open new fields
of cooperation such as culture, education and science and
technology as well as telecommunications, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said Poland was also interested in cooperation in defense
industry between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The two sides also explored the possibility of cooperation in
third markets and Poland would promote Malaysian products in the
markets of former Soviet Union republics, he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, according to Polish Minister of Economy Janusz
Steinhoff who was present at the press conference, bilateral trade
between Poland and Malaysia increased to 200 million U.S. dollars
in 1998 from only 9 million dollars in 1991.
</P>
<P>
Kwasniewski, invited by Malaysia's King Tuanku Ja'afar, arrived
here earlier Monday for a three-day state visit.
</P>
<P>
His visit is the first by a Polish head of state to Malaysia.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 15 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji today
opposes the attempt to include China's Taiwan Province in the
Theater Missile Defense (TMD) system.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese premier made the statement at a news conference at
the Great Hall of the People sponsored by the Second Session of
the Ninth National People's Congress.
</P>
<P>
"We oppose the TMD and we are firmly and particularly opposing
to include Taiwan into the TMD," Zhu said, stressing that the
program violates international agreements and infringes on China's
territory integrity and sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
Zhu also denied the rumor about a recent deployment of 600
missiles along the Taiwan Straits, saying: "I don't know that and
how could you know that China has deployed 600 missiles?"
</P>
<P>
"We are by no means to target missiles at our brothers and
sisters in Taiwan," he emphasized, "and we will not use these
missiles very lightly and easily."
</P>
<P>
Referring to reported tests of missiles and development of
nuclear weapons by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK)
, the premier said China has no rights to interfere in the
internal affairs of an independent country like DPRK.
</P>
<P>
Zhu continued that the U.S. has overestimated the so-called "
China threat." "All the advanced weapons are originated from the
Unites States, what does it need for the United States to be
afraid of it," he said.

KUALA LUMPUR, March 15 (Xinhua) -- Some 490 inmates at a drug

for taking action against inmates who were caught leaving the

<HEADLINE> India Concerned Over Japan's Levying Software </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, March 15 (Xinhua) -- India has expressed its concern
over Japan's insistence on levying a 20 percent withholding tax on
Japanese firms importing Indian software.
</P>
<P>
Japan has breached provisions of bilateral double taxation
avoidance treaty, Press Trust of India (PTI) quoted a top
government official as saying here Monday.
</P>
<P>
At secretary level talks on bilateral economic trade between
India and Japan held in Tokyo in February this year, India had
conveyed its displeasure over Japanese insistence for charging a
20 percent withholding tax on software exported from India, said
S. Devare, secretary for economic affairs in the Ministry of
External Affairs.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese side is reported to have explained that it was due
to some misunderstanding in the provisions of the bilateral double
taxation avoidance treaty.
</P>
<P>
India's software exports to Japan are expected to reach 4,000
million rupees (96.15 million U.S. dollars) in fiscal 1998-99
(April 1, 1998-March 31, 1999). It was four percent of India's
total software shipment in the previous year.

<HEADLINE> Philippines to Host Pesticides Forum for Food Security </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 15 (Xinhua) -- Japanese and Filipino agricultural
experts will take up the latest global trends on the safe use of
pesticides at a forum Tuesday in line with the Philippines
government's goal of training rural folk on environment-friendly
ways of boosting farm productivity.
</P>
<P>
Two agencies attached to the Department of Agriculture (DA) -
the Fertilizer and Pesticide Authority (FPA) and the Bureau of
Plant Industry (BPI) -- are hosting a symposium entitled
"Emboldening the Safe Use of Pesticides toward Food Security in
the New Millennium."
</P>
<P>
The forum, a joint project of the FPA and BPI with the Japan
International Cooperation Agency (JICA), will be held at the
National Pesticide Analytical Laboratory in Manila.
</P>
<P>
The FPA said the forum will be attended by local pesticide
experts, members of the academe, farmer-representatives, industry
practitioners and other concerned groups.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the FPA launched a nationwide training program on the
latest agri-technologies in crop protection and balanced
fertilization as a way to raise the yields of small farmers while
cutting their production costs and environmental risks.
</P>
<P>
The FPA said that under the training project, "the trained
farmers will become trainers themselves to facilitate the transfer
of basic and appropriate agri-technologies in crop protection and
balanced fertilization, particularly rapid composting and soil
testing."

<HEADLINE> Farmers Oppose Liberalization of Farm Sector </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, March 15 (Xinhua) -- World farmers oppose the
liberalization of agricultural sector in multinational trade talks
at the World Trade Organization (WTO), saying the policy benefits
only multinational companies which will sell their products more
easily.
</P>
<P>
This is a conclusion of the latest conference of the so-called
Via Campasina (World Farmers Organization), which ended here
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The conference released a statement, which is available here
Monday, calling on governments throughout the world to withdraw a
proposal to liberalize the agricultural sector from the agenda of
the WTO's multinational trade talks.
</P>
<P>
It said the issue had no benefits to the majority of the world
population and was only in the interests of multinational firms
which had pressed for opening up the sector so that they could
sell their products more easily.
</P>
<P>
The statement also said that opening up the farm sector would
lead to the problem of food monopoly in the world market, where
multinational companies could force farmers to produce only crops
they want.
</P>
<P>
It could also create trade wars, which, again, virtually have
no benefits to any party, especially when the world's poorest were
dying of hunger and malnutrition, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The conference, therefore, drew a conclusion that goes against
a move by the international community to open up global market.

Selome said: "On Sunday, skirmishes broke out between the
Eritrean and Ethiopian defense forces at the Zalambessa-Egela
front. The skirmishes later developed into fighting between the
two sides."
</P>
<P>
She accused the Eritrean troops of "having been occupying
Ethiopian territories in the Zalambessa-Aiga, Bada-Bure and Egela
regions for over nine months" since May 1998.
</P>
<P>
"The Eritrean troops have remained in these Ethiopian
territories in violation of the Organization of African Unity
(OAU) framework agreement for peace," the spokeswoman said.
</P>
<P>
"The territories concerned have always been under Ethiopian
administration, whether under Haile Selassie, the Italians, or the
Derg (the former Mengistu regime)," the spokeswoman said.
</P>
<P>
She added that "in the last few years, three elections have
been held in these localities and members of parliament represent
these areas in the Ethiopian parliament."
</P>
<P>
However, Eritrea says Ethiopia "violated the international
boundary between the two countries to publish in October 1997 a
new official map incorporating large chunks of Eritrean territory
into the Administration Zone of Tigray."
</P>
<P>
Fighting between the Horn of Africa neighbors resumed on
February 6 in the Badme area after an eight-month lull and
subsequently spread to two other fronts.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Premier on TMD, "China Threat" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 15 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji today
opposes the attempt to include China's Taiwan Province in the
Theater Missile Defense (TMD) system with Japan.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese premier made the statement at a news conference at
the Great Hall of the People sponsored by the Second Session of
the Ninth National People's Congress.
</P>
<P>
"We oppose the TMD and we are firmly and particularly opposing
to include Taiwan into the TMD," Zhu said, stressing that the
program violates international agreements and infringes on China's
territory integrity and sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
Zhu also denied the rumor about a recent deployment of 600
missiles along the Taiwan Straits, saying: "I don't know that and
how could you know that China has deployed 600 missiles?"
</P>
<P>
"We are by no means to target missiles at our brothers and
sisters in Taiwan," he emphasized, "and we will not use these
missiles very lightly and easily."
</P>
<P>
Referring to reported tests of missiles and development of
nuclear weapons by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK)
, the premier said China has no rights to interfere in the
internal affairs of an independent country like DPRK.
</P>
<P>
Zhu continued that the U.S. has overestimated the so-called "
China threat." "All the advanced weapons are originated from the
Unites States, what does it need for the United States to be
afraid of it," he said.

<HEADLINE> NATO's Eastward Expansion Affects European Security Pattern (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 15 (Xinhua) -- Chinese military experts,
commenting on the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)
admitting three east European states, said here today that this
marks the first step of NATO's eastward expansion, a step that
will have a far-reaching impact on the security pattern in Europe.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, they expressed doubt that "any positive
outcome could come from utilizing and enlarging this military
alliance," arguing that this step will weaken the security of the
continent.
</P>
<P>
NATO, the world's largest political and military organization,
opened its doors to Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary, the
first new members to be admitted in 17 years. The three countries
did not wait until NATO's 50th anniversary summit in Washington
next month to hand over their documents to the United States, and
have become the first former Warsaw Pact members to join NATO
after the conclusion of the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
Scholars studying international strategies here noted that the
actual launching of NATO's eastward expansion has altered both the
political and military map, and the political situation in Europe,
by promoting NATO as the indisputable center of the European
defense system.
</P>
<P>
Yao Youzhi, a top researcher with the Chinese Academy of
Military Sciences, said that "as an outcome of power politics,
NATO's move could invoke new confrontations." Now that the
boundary between Poland and Belarus has become a border between
NATO and the Commonwealth of Independent States, NATO's move
eastward will surly leave Russia disconcerted, as traditionally
Russia feels safe only by maintaining a buffer zone around itself.
</P>
<P>
It is also understood that NATO eventually will include such
countries as Romania and the Baltic Sea countries in its second
and third round of eastward expansion. Be it is also true that
NATO's "lengthening antennae" will undoubtedly arouse strong
opposition from Russia.

<TEXT>
<P>
Zhu's comments came in response to a Russian reporter's
question whether the Sino-Russian ties are closer than the Sino-U.
S.ties at a press conference this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese premier noted that China and Russia are working to
establish a strategic partnership of coordination, while China and
the U.S. are making efforts to set up a constructive strategic
partnership.
</P>
<P>
On his recent visit to Russia, Zhu said the visit was to
implement the requirements and concrete projects stipulated in the
strategic partnership of coordination jointly initiated by
President Jiang Zemin and his Russian counterpart Boris Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
The visit has scored many results, mainly in the economic and
trade sectors, as more than 10 agreements were signed, he said,
adding "this has been unprecedented".
</P>
<P>
As for Russia's support to China against the TMD (Theater
Missile Defense) system, he said both sides did not talk about
this issue during the visit.
</P>
<P>
However, he said when he met President Yeltsin, the Russian
president put Zhu's hand before his chest, saying "Jiang is my
best friend, and so are you."
</P>
<P>
Zhu also put Yeltsin's hand before his chest and said, "We are
friends indeed worth of trust," he recalled.
</P>
<P>
When the meeting came to an end, Zhu went on to say, Yeltsin
and he hugged each other very "tightly", showing both are "sincere
friends".
</P>
<P>
He believed during his forthcoming visit to the U.S., he could
also get a warm welcome, instead of "walking into a minefield", he
said.
</P>
<P>
"President Bill Clinton and I might not hug each other, but we
might shake hands tightly," he said, adding that these mean the
same in friendship.

<HEADLINE> Premier: China Ready for Biggest Concession Within Capability </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 15 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji said
here today that China is "prepared to make the biggest concession
within its capability" for the entry to the World Trade
Organization.
</P>
<P>
He said at a press conference today that with the experience
accumulated during the course of reform and opening up to the
outside world, China has strengthened its supervision and
regulation, as well as capability and sustainability, with regard
to problems that may arise after China joins the WTO.
</P>
<P>
Another factor in favor of China's entry to the WTO is that,
according to the Premier, WTO members have recognized that a WTO
without China is not representative enough, and that is a neglect
of China as a huge potential market.
</P>
<P>
He said that it has been 13 years since the negotiations began
on China's resumption of the GATT membership and later its access
to the WTO.
</P>
<P>
"Black hair has turned gray," he said, "It's high time to
conclude the negotiations."
</P>
<P>
China's recent talks with some WTO members have narrowed the
gap of their respective positions, but major differences remain,
he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
"It is hopeful for both sides to reach an agreement as long as
they make concessions out of the larger interests of promoting
stability and prosperity of the international trade," Zhu said.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Suggests Direct Balloting on E. Timor Future </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, March 15 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government has
suggested that the United Nations-sponsored direct balloting to
determine if the East Timor wants autonomy or independence should
be held in July, Foreign Minister Ali Alatas said here Monday.
</P>
<P>
"(The direct balloting could) be held in July as (revisions to
the Indonesian government's) proposal for (wide-ranging) autonomy
(in East Timor) will be completed in April," Alatas said.
</P>
<P>
He said that during the recent tripartite talks on East Timor,
U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan tabled three options to garner
the East Timorese' view on Jakarta's proposal for autonomy.
</P>
<P>
These are that the U.N. select a number of leading East
Timorese figures who could give their views on autonomy; the U.N.
select a council comprising 35 people; and a direct vote.
</P>
<P>
On March 11, the tripartite talks, which involved Indonesia,
Portugal and the U.N., reached agreement on the third choice.
</P>
<P>
In Jakarta's point of view, Alatas said, direct balloting is
much better than a referendum, which would require all East
Timorese living abroad to return home to be able to join the
referendum.
</P>
<P>
Alatas said that with the use of a direct vote to determine the
true aspirations of the East Timorese, it will be proven if 90
percent of the East Timorese indeed prefer independence to
continued integration with Indonesia, as some East Timorese
pro-independence leaders claimed.
</P>
<P>
East Timor, with a population of some 800,000 and an area of
15,000 square kilometers, had been a Portuguese colony until 1975.
It became an Indonesian province in 1976, but the U.N. never
recognized the move.

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 15 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian President Yasser
Arafat will hold talks Monday with South African President Nelson
Mandela in Finnish capital Helsinki, Mandela's aide said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Arafat, who is on a whirlwind tour of the Middle East and north
Europe, is consulting foreign leaders on his plans to declare
palestinian statehood on May 4.
</P>
<P>
Mandela's aide confirmed that Arafat would meet Mandela just
after noon Monday to brief him "about the situation in his
country", South African Press Association reported. Mandela is on
a week-long state visit to five northern European countries.
</P>
<P>
Arafat will also brief United States President Bill Clinton in
Washington and French President Jacques Chirac in Paris Later this
week.
</P>
<P>
A top Palestinian official said at the weekend that Arafat was
considering requests and advice to delay the declaration of
statehood.
</P>
<P>
However, Arafat would only take a decision once he consulted
all the signatories to the Oslo peace accords.
</P>
<P>
The United States and the European Union (EU) want Arafat to

<HEADLINE> Premier: China's Human Rights Cause Progressing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 15 (Xinhua) -- Premier Zhu Rongji said here
today that China's human rights cause is progressing day by day.
</P>
<P>
Zhu made the remark at a press conference which that is held
right after the conclusion of the Second Session of the Ninth
National People's Congress.
</P>
<P>
"We have adopted laws and regulations to intensify legislation
work to protect human rights, and we will continue to do so," the
Premier stressed.
</P>
<P>
Zhu said that "foreign friends are welcome to criticise our
work, but don't be impatient, I am more impatient than you after
all."
</P>
<P>
The premier said he recently told U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright when he met her in Beijing that he joined the
revolutionary struggle for democracy, freedom and human rights of
the Chinese people much earlier than Albright's career for human
rights. He told Albright he is ten years older than her.
</P>
<P>
"We have been influenced by the May Fourth Movement which
fought for democracy and science, and under the leadership of the
Communist Party of China, we fought against the dictatorship and
violations of human rights for many decades. Today, how could we
possibly suppress human rights?" he questioned.
</P>
<P>
"And only we know how we can preserve and protect human rights
in China," Zhu stressed.
</P>
<P>
He said that he cannot say that China is perfect in human
rights. Comparing the long history of China's feudalism and semi-
colonialism of several thousand years with a short history of 50
years of new China, which was founded in 1949, he said that China'
s human rights cause has made much headway and is progressing
every day.

<HEADLINE> NATO's Eastward Expansion Affects European Security Pattern (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Another scholar, Luo Yuan, said, "NATO's eastward expansion has
intensified the U.S.'s dominant role in European security, and
there are grounds for some international figures to worry about
NATO's trend toward a formidable pro-military group."
</P>
<P>
Luo also pointed out that NATO's expansionist intention is
clear to all, citing its interference in Kosovo and its recent
demand to enhance dialogues with countries in the Mediterranean
and Middle East regions.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. is "arranging chessmen at the most critical places on
the chessboards of the European and Asian continents" in an
attempt to "establish two strategic platforms," said Dr. Peng
Guangqian. NATO has in substance become a "tool" of the U.S. as it
seeks hegemony in Europe, he added.
</P>
<P>
Recently, the U.S. has begun to intervene militarily in other
countries, regardless of objections from the United Nations.
Backed up by the U.S., NATO began to become involved in Kosovo,
which actually runs counter to its promise to handle defence
affairs only within the scope of its member countries. NATO's
increased ability to control regional conflicts, as gained from
its eastward expansion, has supported it in adopting a daring move
in Kosovo, Peng argued.
</P>
<P>
While U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright regards
participation of the three new countries in NATO as "a continuing
process instead of a single event," the scholars here insist that
"it's needless for NATO to maintain and even to expand such a
military coalition." "It will only destroy balance and incur new
turbulence in the region," they said, calling for close attention
to NATO's expansionist trend.

<HEADLINE> Report of IMF Suspending loan to Uganda Refuted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, March 15 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary Fund
(IMF) has not suspended lending to Uganda but has delayed by two
months disbursement of the second tranche of the Extended
Structural Adjustment Facility (ESAF).
</P>
<P>
Emmanuel Tumusiime Mutebile, secretary to the treasury, said
over the weekend that the 20 million U.S. dollars loan was
supposed to have been given in April and that it is likely to be
here in June now, the New Vision daily reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
An IMF mission was in Kampala in February to review the ESAF
program for the first half of the financial year 1998/1999 and
the multilateral financial institution decided to delay the loan
after finding Uganda had not met the nine performance criteria.
</P>
<P>
Tumusiime said Uganda missed five of the nine criteria very
marginally and the problem IMF has is with the composition of
defense expenditure.
</P>
<P>
Defense was not one of the criteria but it went up to 2.2
percent of GDP instead of 1.9 percent, he said.
</P>
<P>
Uganda promised the IMF that it can guarantee defense spending
will not increase for the rest of the financial year and for all
next year, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The official asserted that the IMF would release the next
tranche after monitoring Uganda's commitment over the next two
months.
</P>
<P>
Uganda's development relies heavily on loans from outside,
especially those from multilateral financial institutions like the
Work Bank and IMF.

BEIJING, March 15 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji said
here today that his trip to the United States next month is
designed to present a true picture about China and resume the good
momentum of a constructive strategic partnership between the two
countries.

Zhu said jokingly at a press conference that he himself is a

that his trip could not possibly be successful.
</P>
<P>
"But I will continue to go on this trip," he said, adding that
since some people in the United States have anger and complaints,
he would let them to vent their anger and complaints.

His trip to the United States will not be to a minefield, but

<HEADLINE> Vietnam, U.S. Start 7th Round of Trade Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, March 15 (Xinhua) -- The seventh round of
trade-agreement talks between Vietnam and the United States began
here Monday, but observers here said progress must be quickened or
a deal will remain a distant prospect.
</P>
<P>
During the current round of talks, which is expected to last
five days, the two sides will discuss a number of remaining
unresolved points, including investment services, copyright and
intellectual property, and freeing-up trade.
</P>
<P>
Nguyen Dinh Luong, head of the Ministry of Trade's
Europe-America Department, is heading the Vietnamese side, while
the U.S. delegation is led by Joseph Damond.
</P>
<P>
If an agreement is not reached soon, it is quite likely that
U.S. domestic politics ahead of next year's presidential elections
could slow the process for several years, the Saigon Times daily
Monday quoted observers as saying.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Ambassador to Vietnam Pete Peterson told the local press
that the two sides were working hard on the pact, so it is
possible that a deal could be sealed this year.
</P>
<P>
After the sixth round of talks in Hanoi last June, Vietnam
delivered its answers to the United States in January to some
points presented by Washington.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam earlier this month announced a one-year 50-percent
import surcharge waiver on U.S. imports starting January 1.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam last year exported to the United States about 534
million U.S. dollars worth of goods. Imports from the U.S. were
valued at some 200 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Their two-way trade reached 611 million dollars in 1997, 411
million dollars in 1995 and 597 million dollars in 1996.

<HEADLINE> Central Socialist Academy Opens Spring Semester </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 15 (Xinhua) -- Non-Communist party officials,
who will study in the spring semester class of the Central
Socialist Academy, were urged today to improve their political
awareness and help their parties do a better job in participating
in government and political affairs.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the opening ceremony of the academy's spring
semester in Beijing today, Wang Zhaoguo, vice chairman of the
National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative
Conference, called on the students to unite their party members to
gather around the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee
with Jiang Zemin at the core, hold high the banner of Deng
Xiaoping Theory, share weal and woe with the CPC, and contribute
to the building of socialism with Chinese characteristics in the
21st Century.
</P>
<P>
The Central Socialist Academy is a united party school of non-
Communist parties and persons without party affiliation. He Luli,
vice chairwoman of the Standing Committee of the National People's
Congress and chairman of the Revolutionary Committee of the
Chinese Kuomintang Central Committee, is the president of the
academy.
</P>
<P>
Some 127 officials, most of whom were newly elected for the new
term, will study there during the spring semester.
</P>
<P>
"We should strengthen our resolve to the leadership of the CPC
to seize opportunities and face challenges of the new century,"
concluded Wang Zhaoguo, also head of the United Front Work
Department of the CPC Central Committee.

<HEADLINE> China Uses Past Experience To Ease Financial Crisis Impact: Premier </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 15 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji said
here today that the reason for China to stand "rock firm" amid the
Asian financial crisis is that it prevented the country from an
overheated economy by implementing proper macro-economic
regulation and control.
</P>
<P>
"As a matter of fact, China experienced such crisis as early as
in 1993. Fortunately we took measures to check the unhealthy trend
timely before it got spread," said the premier at the press
conference this afternoon held immediately after the closing
meeting of the 2nd session of the National People's Congress,
China's highest lawmaking body.
</P>
<P>
Looking back at the economic overheating in 1993 in sectors of
real estate, development zones and stock market which led to an
inflation rate of 21.7 percent in 1994, Zhu said that of the 16
macro-economic regulation measures the central government took to
fight the runaway inflation, 13 are economic measures, out of
which 11 were related to banking and financial sectors.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to the measures, China has brought its economy back onto
the right track and resumed its growth momentum and has scored
great achievements since then, Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
He cited a New York Times article which criticized the United
States for its role in prompting the financial crisis in Asia,
stressing that economic development and financial liberalization
must be accompanied with macro control and regulation policies and
different macro control or regulation polices should be adopted
according to the specific conditions of different countries, he
said.
</P>
<P>
"To urge a country to liberalize or open its capital market too
quickly, or to require an overflow of capital in the country would
only result in what we say 'more haste, less speed' and can only
undermine the economy of the country concerned," Zhu warned.

<HEADLINE> Australia Expected to Spend Huge Sum on Fighters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, March 15 (Xinhua) -- Australia is expected to spend 5
billion Australian dollars (3.15 billion U.S. dollars) to replace
the Royal Australian Air Force's aging F/A-18 Hornet fighters and
F-111 bombers in what will be Australia's biggest purchase of new
defense equipment.
</P>
<P>
A government discussion paper on options for fast jet
replacement, set to be released in the next few months, will
canvass the expected awesome cost of maintaining a front-line
fighter and strike capability.
</P>
<P>
It is also expected to assess what level of air force
capability is needed in line with current strategic assessments
and whether the job needs one or two types of aircraft, the
Australian Associated Press reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The paper will be a first for an Australian government in
promoting public debate on what will be a major outlay of
taxpayers' funds.
</P>
<P>
Under current expectations, the Hornets will reach the end of
their useful life in the second decade of the next century and the
F-111s a few years later. That would make the oldest Hornet around
30 and the oldest F-111 a geriatric 50.
</P>
<P>
With the conclusion of the Hornet fatigue test program now
being conducted by the Defense Science and Technology Organization
in Melbourne, the air force should have a clear indication of just
how long it can keep the aircraft flying before they start to
break.
</P>
<P>
Both the Hornets and F-111s are regarded as superior to any
aircraft flown by any regional air force, the F-111s by a big
margin indeed.
</P>
<P>
The Royal Australian Air Force initially ordered 75 Hornets in
1981 but has since lost a few in accidents.
</P>
<P>
An order for 24 F-111s was placed in 1963 with the first
delivered to Australia in December 1973. In 1993 the air force
bought another 15 used aircraft from the U.S. Air Force for spares
and making up attrition losses.

BEIJING, March 15 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji said
here today that his trip to the United States later this month is
designed to present a true picture about China and resume the good
momentum of a constructive strategic partnership between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
Zhu said jokingly at a press conference that he himself is a
victim of the bad atmosphere in the United States, because a photo
at the cover of the Business Weekly makes him "look like a dead
man."
</P>
<P>
Zhu said he is fully aware that under such a bad atmosphere his
task during the trip will not be easy, and some media predicted
that his trip could not possibly be successful.
</P>
<P>
"But I will continue to go on this trip," he said, adding that
since some people in the United States have anger and complaints,
he would let them to vent their anger and complaints.
</P>
<P>
His trip to the United States will not be to a minefield, but

<P>
BEIJING, March 15 (Xinhua) -- The so-called "spy case" in which
China has allegedly obtained nuclear secrects from the United
States is a "real fallacy", Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji said here
today.
</P>
<P>
"I think that on this issue some Americans have made two
mistakes due to underestimation," Zhu said at a press conference
held right after the conclusion of the Second Session of the Ninth
National People's Congress.
</P>
<P>
Firstly, those Americans have underestimated the ability of the
United States to keep secret, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Los Alamos Lab has a very strict control system to keep
secret and so far no evidence has been found to support the
allegation that Wen Ho Lee had stolen military secrects, Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
Secondly, those Americans have underestimated the ability of
China in research and development of military technology, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese people are very intelligent and diligent, Zhu said,
adding that "China is now fully capable of developing any kind of
military technology and it is only a matter of time".
</P>
<P>
"So, why should we put ourselves under political and moral
risks to steal military technology?" he asked.

<HEADLINE> Police Leave Canceled for 2000 New Year in Australian States </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, March 15 (Xinhua) -- All police leave over 2000 New
Year has been canceled in Australia's southeastern state of
Tasmania because of fears of huge parties and Y2K (year 2000
millennium bug) problems.
</P>
<P>
Tasmania is believed to be the second state to have cancelled
all police leave after Victoria.
</P>
<P>
The Tasmania state government decided Monday that all police
leave between December 28, 1999 and January 14, 2000 be cancelled,
according to an Australian Associated Press report.
</P>
<P>
Southeastern Tasmania, which will be one of the first parts of
Australia to see the dawn of the new millennium, is expecting huge
New Years Eve parties.
</P>
<P>
Most hotels in the capital city Hobart, are already booked out.
</P>
<P>
Although the government believes it's well advanced in dealing
with millennium bug problems, it's taking no chances.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman said extra police would be needed in case vital
facilities like traffic lights crashed.

<HEADLINE> EDS-URGENT Last Year's Difficulties Greater Than Expected: Premier </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 15 (Xinhua) -- China's Premier Zhu Rongji said
here today that the year 1998 was an extremely difficult year and
the difficulties were even greater than he had anticipated.
</P>
<P>
"There are two major reasons behind the difficulties: First,
the effect of the Asian financial crisis was greater than we
expected, and secondly, the severe summer flooding also caused
greater difficulties than we expected," said the premier at a
press conference which was held right after the conclusion of the
Second Session of the Ninth National People's Congress, the
country's legislature, this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
He continued to say that China has tided over these two
difficulties and stood rock-solid under the leadership of the
Chinese Communist Party Central Committee with Jiang Zemin at the
core, and with concerted efforts of the Chinese people.
</P>
<P>
"That's why I have said in my government work report that all
the achievements during the past year are hard-won." Zhu stressed.
</P>
<P>
When asked about what made him the most dissatisfied with, the
Premier said he felt he had not done a good job, and some
departments and localities had failed to fully implemented the
policies and measures of the central government.
</P>
<P>
In response to a question of what touched him most during the
past year, the premier said he was moved almost to tears during
his inspection of the flood-devastated areas last summer when he
saw the People's Liberation Army soldiers use their own bodies to
plug the dikes and protect the safety of the Chinese people.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Premier on U.S. Visit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 15 (Xinhua) -- Sino-U.S. relations have been
victimized by internal conflicts in the United States, Chinese
Premier Zhu Rongji said here today.
</P>
<P>
He told a press conference sponsored by the just concluded
second session of the Ninth National People's Congress (NPC) this
afternoon that he expects to encounter some "hostile or unfriendly
atmosphere" during his coming visit to the U.S.
</P>
<P>
"I noted that in February 22 issue of Business Week, there is
an article titled: China, What's Going Wrong?" he said.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the Business Week article depicting China as being
plagued by serious disasters, Zhu said that the story is "very
special."
</P>
<P>
"So far I have never seen any other article of this kind
appearing in the U.S. media. In fact, it reflects the trend.
The Sino-U.S. relations have been victimized by internal struggle
in the U.S.," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the anti-China tide emerging in Washington
recently caused deep concern in China.
</P>
<P>
"I myself was also victimized by this anti-China trend. My
picture on the cover of that issue of the Business Week magazine
looks like a dead man," he said.
</P>
<P>
This shows that since some people in the U.S. have anger or
complaints, "I'll go there to vent their anger or complaints, to
tell them about the true picture in China," he said.

<HEADLINE> China's Top Legislator on Role of NPC-1 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 15 (Xinhua) -- The Second Session of the Ninth
National People's Congress, which just successfully concluded, has
been a democratic, united, pragmatic and inspiring conference,
said Li Peng, China's top legislator here today.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the closing meeting of the current session of the
Ninth NPC, the nation's highest legislature, Li Peng said, "China
faces even more arduous tasks this year given the new situations
and new problems in its economic and social development."
</P>
<P>
"We hope the State Council and the ministries and departments
concerned could improve work by earnestly studying the proposals
and suggestions raised by the NPC deputies and the resolutions
adopted at the current session," he said.
</P>
<P>
Li also called for efforts to promote reform and opening-up,
expand domestic demand, further state-owned enterprise reform,
ensure survival stipends and re-employment of laid-off workers,
and build a clean and efficient government, he said.
</P>
<P>
Referring to judicial corruption as a problem of common concern
among the deputies, the Ninth NPC Standing Committee chairman
pointed out that a basic solution is to further judicial reform
and improve the supervisory system to ensure just jurisdiction.
</P>
<P>
Li Peng also spoke highly of constitutional amendments in his
speech. He said the NPC session amends the Constitution at an
appropriate time and in accordance with the guidelines of the 15th
National Congress of the Communist Party of China.
</P>
<P>
Li noted the amendment endorses Deng Xiaoping as a guiding
ideology of China, enshrines the principle of "governing the
country according to law", defines the country's fundamental
economic and distribution systems in the current stage and
highlights the important role of the non-public sector in the
national economy.

<TEXT>
<P>
Affirming the status of the Chinese Communist Party as the core
of the leadership of the nation's socialist cause and the ruling
party of the country, the top legislator said that consolidating
the Party's leadership conforms to giving play to the role of the
people's congresses.
</P>
<P>
"Under the leadership of the Party, the people draw up the
Constitution and law, abide by and enforce the Constitution and
law. The Party also carries out its activities within the
framework of the Constitution and law." he said.
</P>
<P>
"Compared to its legislative work, the supervisory role of the
people's congresses is still a weak link and such role needs to be
improved and strengthened," Li said.
</P>
<P>
"Supervision should be strengthened on key issues concerning
reform, development, and stability, problems of common concern,
and problems which attract the loudest complaints from the general
public." Li said.
</P>
<P>
He said the NPC Standing Committee has set on its legislation
agenda the drafting of Law of Supervision and will work it out as
early as possible in response to the call of the NPC deputies at
the session.
</P>
<P>
The chairman also called for the people's congresses and their
standing committees to follow the mass line in legislation and
supervision.
</P>
<P>
"All the power of the state belongs to the people, and the
people exercise the state power through the National People's
Congress and local people's congresses. The people empower the
people's congresses, and the people's congresses should take it
their responsibilities to exercise the power on people's behalf,"
he said.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Constitutional Amendments Propel China's Reform and Opening-up (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After 10 years of rapid development, the private sector now
contributes some 15 percent of China's gross domestic product (GDP)
, while shareholding and overseas-funded enterprises also become
an important part of the national economy, said Yu.
</P>
<P>
The second Constitutional amendment in 1993 abolished the
central planning economy long practiced in China and decided that
the country would strive to build a "socialist market economy".
</P>
<P>
"This amendment helped China to go on a fast track of economic
growth and brought enormous changes to the country's economic
system," noted Yu.
</P>
<P>
At present, there is an abundant supply of all kinds of
commodities in China, while prices of 97.3 percent of these
commodities are decided by market demands.
</P>
<P>
Wang Jiafu, a legal expert with the Chinese Academy of Social
Sciences, said that the fundamental purpose of the current
Constitutional amendment is to safeguard the cause of reform and
opening-up, add impetus to the development of China's productive
forces and further improve the people's living standards.
</P>
<P>
Private businessmen and entrepreneurs across China have warmly
welcomed this amendment, which not only stipulates that the
country should adhere to a fundamental economic system under which
the public ownership dominates and other forms of ownership are
allowed to co-exist and seek common development, but also bolsters
the status of the private sector as "an important component" of
the socialist market economy.
</P>
<P>
"Many private enterprises used to prefer short-term investment
for worries about possible policy changes," said Liu Yonghao, a
Chinese private businessman ranked among the world's 500 richest
persons by Forbes magazine. "Now we feel safe to make long-term
investment and plan for development in the long run."

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 15 (Xinhua) -- A Constitutional amendment draft
adopted by China's top lawmaking body, the National People's
Congress (NPC), here today has enshrined Deng Xiaoping Theory,
which has guided China's reform and opening-up drive in the past
two decades, into the country's Constitution, thus providing a
legal guarantee for the reforms and opening-up at the top level.
</P>
<P>
Theorists and law experts here describe the amendment this time,
the third of its kind since 1988, as "a milestone."
</P>
<P>
"It also shows the strong determination of the collective
leadership of the third generation of the ruling Communist Party
of China (CPC) with Jiang Zemin at the core and the entire Chinese
people to forge ahead along the line of reform and opening-up
initiated by the late Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping," commented a
Party theorist who attended the just-concluded Second Session of
the Ninth NPC as a deputy.
</P>
<P>
According to Pang Xianzhi, director of the Party Literature
Research Center of the CPC Central Committee, China's three
amendments to its Constitution, which was enacted in 1982, are
actually efforts to raise all successful experience of reform and
opening-up to the level of the will of the state and the people.
</P>
<P>
"China's reform actually started with the reform of its
ownership system, which occurred first in the rural areas and then
in the cities," said economist Yu Zuyao.
</P>
<P>
There were already some 220,000 private enterprises and more
than 10 million private business people in China when the first
Constitutional amendment was made in 1988, which allowed the
private sector to exist and develop as a "supplement" to the
formerly "extremely pure" public ownership economy.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Constitutional Amendments Propel China's Reform and Opening-up (3) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Law experts and sociologists also praised the current amendment
for endorsing the principle of "governing the country according to
law" and including the wording that China will remain in the
primary stage of socialism "for a long period of time."
</P>
<P>
Enshrining the principle of "governing the country according to
law" into the Constitution shows that China has bid a complete
farewell to the rule by man and will adopt the rule of law, which
can help prevent the recurrence of any internal disorder such as
the "Cultural Revolution" (1966-1976), said Wang Jiafu.
</P>
<P>
The concept that the primary stage of socialism will remain "
for a long period of time" will help people to always keep a sober
mind and help the cause of reform and opening-up to avoid any
unnecessary setbacks," said sociologist Lu Xueyi.
</P>
<P>
While China probably only needs several dozens of years to
accomplish its transition from a planned economy to a market
economy, Lu said, it might take more than one hundred years for
the country to develop from a traditional agricultural society
into a modern industrial society.
</P>
<P>
According to Liu Zheng, an official with the NPC Standing
Committee, legislators attending this year's NPC session have
submitted a number of bills concerning legislation efforts related
to the Constitutional amendment, such as enacting a law on private
businesses and law on individual bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
"Some of these proposed motions, such as a law on property
rights, are of critical importance to the further development of
reform and opening-up, and the NPC Standing Committee has included
them in its legislative agenda," he said.

the same time we enjoy ourselves by watching exciting boxing,"
said Lin Li, an actress who often invites her friends to the bar.

<HEADLINE> China's Iron, Steel Prices Stable </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 15 (Xinhua) -- China's iron and steel prices are
remaining stable thanks to the country's efforts to increase
domestic demand.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest information from the Shanghai East
China Iron and Steel Market, price of various kinds of threading
steel products has been maintained at about 2,150 yuan per ton.
</P>
<P>
The price for high-quality products from the Shanghai Iron and
Steel Plant has been kept at between 2,160 yuan and 2,170 yuan per
ton.
</P>
<P>
This indicates that the vicious price competition in this
sector, which has persisted for a long time, has been basically
contained, said insiders.
</P>
<P>
However, the price-rise margin will not be too great because it
will take a relatively long time to form a healthy iron and steel
market system, according to experts.

<HEADLINE> Talks on Kosovo Resume in Paris </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The delegates of the two conflicting sides of Kosovo are
expected to sign a peace agreement on Kosovo which was presented
by the six-nation Contact Group on former Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
No deadline was given for them to accept the peace plan, but
the European Unions officials have expected the talks to end in
from four days to one week.
</P>
<P>
At stake are two most sensitive issues -- the deployment of a
NATO-led international peacekeeping force in Kosovo, and the
abandoning by Kosovo Albanians the request for independence and
the disarmament of the Albanian separatist force the Kosovo
Liberation Army.
</P>
<P>
The Yugoslav government has categorically rejected the
perspective of the deployment of a foreign force in Kosovo,
considering such a move as one of occupation.
</P>
<P>
The Albanian side has also refused to give up its call for
independence after a three-year interim period and the disarmament
of the KLA.
</P>
<P>
Western mediators gave a more prudent tone this time than
during the Rambouillet talks three weeks ago as for the chances of
a success of the talks.
</P>
<P>
Just like at the Rambouillet talks, the Serb delegation was
headed by the vice prime minister of the Serbian Republic, Ratko
Markovic, but was accompanied by the President of the Serbian
Republic Milan Milutinovic who is not a member of the delegation.
</P>
<P>
The two co-chairmen of the talks, French Foreign Minister
Hubert Vedrine and British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook, will have
a meeting with the three international mediators for Kosovo Monday
afternoon, said French foreign ministry sources.

MANILA, March 15 (Xinhua) -- Ninety-eight percent of Filipino
children have rotten teeth or suffer from tooth decay, the Health
Department said in a report issued at the weekend.
</P>
<P>
This dental disease is one of the five leading causes of
morbidity in the country, the report said.
</P>
<P>
In the past, there had been poor appreciation of the important
role of oral health in the improvement of the quality of life and
in the socio-economic development of the country, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Except for the elite and affluent, Filipinos continue to live
with their dental problems in ignorance or with acceptance,
resigned suffering for lack of access to information and basic
dental services.
</P>
<P>
Besides esthetic and psychological effects, this disease
contributes to the high frequency rates of absenteeism in school
and industry.
</P>
<P>
The Health Department is sponsoring a program to urge citizens
to donate kiddie tooth brushes and support dental health education
activities in schools and communities.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania to Further Open Foreign Exchange Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The officials said a team of five experts under the supervision
of the bank governor Daudi Balali is undertaking the task which is
envisaged to be completed before the end of this financial year by
June 30.
</P>
<P>
When new laws and regulations are in place, it is expected that
any person can bring in and repatriate foreign currency abroad
without a requirement to buy or invest in the country first.
</P>
<P>
Established in 1994, transactions at Tanzania's foreign exchange
market has been moving away from foreign exchange controls to
increasingly market-oriented.
</P>
<P>
However, the current regulations require one to either buy or
make investment in the country before the person is permitted to
repatriate foreign currency abroad.
</P>
<P>
Economic analysts see the new move as further signs of
Tanzania's commitment to the World Bank and International Monetary
Fund to make the country more attractive to foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the BoT officials refuted that there are plans to
soften the current tight fiscal policies on grounds that poor
liquidity is affecting import business.
</P>
<P>
The current BoT goal is to further keep down inflation rate
which now stands at 9.1 percent and strengthen the Tanzania
shilling, they observed.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Ambassador Rejects Lab-theft Story </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 14 (Xinhua) -- Chinese ambassador to the
United States Li Zhaoxing Sunday refuted allegations by some
American newspapers about Chinese stealing of U.S. nuclear secrets
as "completely unfounded" and "extremely irresponsible."
</P>
<P>
China has always strictly abided by the norms of international
law, committed itself to cooperation accords with other countries,
respected their domestic laws, and has never carried out illegal
activities abroad, Li said in an interview with Xinhua, People's
Daily and Chinese Central Television.
</P>
<P>
Some newspapers here alleged that by the end of the 70s, a
Taiwan-born American scientist at a laboratory in California
leaked to China neutron-bomb secrets, and in the middle of the 80s,
some people again provided China with warhead secrets so that
China could produce weapons of a similar kind.
</P>
<P>
"These are sheer fabrications," Li said.
</P>
<P>
The work at the laboratory in California sensationally
described by some American reporters was, in fact, concerned only
with topics of international scientific conferences and contents
of normal academic exchanges, he said.
</P>
<P>
Li also retorted the rumored leakage of U.S. laser technology
to China. "In a statement published in February 1998, seven
Chinese scientists refuted the allegation by providing lots of
convincing evidences. But not an American newspaper has so far had
the courage to publish the statement, nor has any American
reporter responded to it," he said.
</P>
<P>
In the 90s, Li said, laboratories of the two countries carried
out some exchange and cooperative programs at the request of the U.
S. side and "in accordance with the principles of equality and
mutual benefit, openness and transparency."
</P>
<P>
Such exchange programs, which exist among many countries in the
world, tally with U.S. interests and have nothing to do with the
so-called "lab-theft", Li said. "I'm glad to see that many
Americans have recently spoken out from a sense of justice,
pointing out that the fabrications were made out of ulterior
political motives," he said.
</P>
<P>
According to Li, many scientists and engineers in China had
written to him, expressing indignation over the irresponsible U.S.
press reports, which they regarded as an insult to Chinese
scientists and as a sign of arrogance and prejudice of the rumor-
mongers.
</P>
<P>
Chinese scientists are capable and intelligent enough to
develop China's own high-technology, and they are willing to
conduct exchanges with foreign counterparts and learn from each
other, li said. But, he stressed, "this can only be done on the
basis of mutual respect."
</P>
<P>
Li said that it is no surprise that rumors and slanders have
occurred from time to time recently, since there are always some
Americans who do not want to see any progress in Sino-U.S.
relations.
</P>
<P>
Sino-American ties have been moving forward following the
exchange of visits by the heads of state of the two countries, but
those people felt uneasy and started to make troubles. They played
up "China threat," trying to stymie normal scientific and
technological exchanges and cooperation and undermine the sound
development of the relations between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Li said the perverse acts of those people who refuse to accept
hard facts, and disregard the common interests and aspirations of
the Chinese and American peoples will yield no benefits.
</P>
<P>
The veteran diplomat said that the Chinese people treasure the
friendly ties between China and the United States. The upcoming
visit of Premier Zhu Rongji to the United States at the invitation
of President Clinton represents another major event in Sino-U.S.
relations. His visit has been welcomed in the United States and
this is the mainstream in American society.
</P>
<P>
"We are ready to joint hands with the U.S. side to make
preparations and overcome obstacles so as to ensure the visit a
complete success," he said.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Legislature Adopts Constitutional Amendment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 15 (Xinhua) -- The Second Session of the Ninth
National People's Congress (NPC), China's top legislature, today
adopted by voting an amendment to the country's Constitution.
</P>
<P>
In a speech delivered at the session's closing meeting here
this afternoon, Li Peng, chairman of the NPC Standing Committee,
said that the constitutional amendment has been made at an
appropriate time and in accordance with the guidelines of the 15th
National Congress of the Communist Party of China held in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The amendment confirms Deng Xiaoping Theory as a guiding
ideology for China's reform and opening up, enshrines the
principle of "governing the country according to law," defines the
country's basic economic and distribution systems in the current
stage and highlights the important role of the non-public sector
of the economy, Li noted.
</P>
<P>
"The amendment, which is needed for further promoting our
country's economic and social development, reflects the successful
practice of reform and opening up and represents the common
aspirations of the people of all ethnic groups across the country,
" he stressed.
</P>
<P>
The top legislator went on to say that the constitutional
amendment has a great bearing on the Chinese people's efforts to
hold high the great banner of Deng Xiaoping Theory, adhere to the
Party's basic line in the primary stage of socialism, develop a
socialist market economy, promote socialist democracy and achieve
socialist ethical and cultural progress.
</P>
<P>
"After the amendment, China's Constitution is closer to
perfection and more suitable to the country's actual conditions,
and will play a more significant role in our efforts to forge
ahead triumphantly along the road of building socialism with
Chinese characteristics," Li said.
</P>
<P>
The current amendment is the third of its kind to China's
existing Constitution which was passed in 1982. The previous two
amendments were made in 1988 and 1993, respectively.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese legislature is expected to publish the full text of
the constitutional amendment today.

<HEADLINE> Rural Readers Form China's Largest Book Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 15 (Xinhua) -- China's rural area has become the
country's largest book market, according to a monthly publication
released today by the Information Center of the Press and
Publications Administration.
</P>
<P>
The publication, the New Book Catalogue of China, said that the
number of rural readers has been rapidly increasing during the
past two decades of reform and opening, and that the book
consumption growth rate of China's rural residents now exceeds
that of urban residents.
</P>
<P>
At the recently concluded '99 Beijing Book Fair, books on
agriculture, and farmers and rural life were among the most
popular. More than 30,000 sets of a 160-volume series, the
Achieving Prosperity Book Series For the 900 Million Chinese
Farmers, were sold at the book fair.
</P>
<P>
"The Third Plenary Session of the 15th Central Committee of the
Communist Party of China, held late last year, emphasized the
fundamental status of agriculture and decided to further enhance
the rural work, thus creating a good environment for the booming
rural book market," said Zhang Lianping, a senior publisher in
Beijing.
</P>
<P>
"Further exploring the rural book market should be a key goal
for China's publishers in the next several years," he said.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics, books related to culture and education,
agricultural technology, life practices, and social sciences are
the ones most welcomed by China's rural readers.

<HEADLINE> Iran Denounces Israeli Claim over Jerusalem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, March 15 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman
Hamid Reza Asefi has harshly condemned Israeli cabinet's
resolution on Israel's claimed sovereignty over a united Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
In a quick reaction to the Israeli move, Asefi called the
resolution "without the slightest sense of any commitments to
international norms and laws," according to the official Islamic
Republic News Agency Monday.
</P>
<P>
The agency reported that the spokesman on Sunday evening called
on the world community and Islamic nations to counter such "evil
expansionist designs" of Israel.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli cabinet on Sunday adopted a resolution on
Jerusalem, rejecting any division of the city and reconfirming it
as Israeli's permanent capital.
</P>
<P>
The resolution came after the European Union announced not to
recognize Israel's sovereignty over the entire Jerusalem, noting
that its fate will be decided in the final-status talks stipulated
under the 1993 Oslo accords.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman also voiced concerns of the Organization of the
Islamic Conference, which is currently chaired by Iran, over
Israel's "dangerous decision and domineering policies" on
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
He also blamed the international communities for its
"indecisiveness" over Israel's expansionist policies.

<HEADLINE> Silt-Discharge Tunnels for Xiaolangdi Project Completed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHENGZHOU, March 15 (Xinhua) -- Three silt-discharge tunnels
for the World Bank-financed Xiaolangdi water control project on
the Yellow River have been completed ahead of schedule, creating
favorable conditions for the project to pass this year's flood
season safely.
</P>
<P>
Considered the greatest project yet for harnessing the Yellow
River, China's second longest, the Xiaolangdi project consists of
underground power-generating units, flood- and silt-discharge
tunnels and networks, and a dam. It is expected to be completed
in 2001.
</P>
<P>
By then, the project, in conjunction with the Sanmenxia, Luhun
and Guxian reservoirs and embankments downstream, will be able to
withstand even the worst floods.
</P>
<P>
The three silt-discharge tunnels, each 1,105 meters long and 6.
5 meters in diameter, have been built within the mountains on the
northern bank of the Yellow River.
</P>
<P>
Engineers with the Xiaolangdi project said that the newly
completed silt-discharge tunnels will be used together with two
other water diversion tunnels to discharge water during this year'
s flood season, which usually occurs in the summer.
</P>
<P>
The Xiaolangdi project, including the dam which is 1,667 meters
long and 154 meters high, is being constructed at a cost of 34.75
billion yuan, including World-Bank loans totaling 1.1 billion U.S.
dollars.

<HEADLINE> Jordan Rejects Israeli Plan to Reduce Water </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, March 15 (Xinhua) -- Jordan has rejected an Israeli plan
to reduce its water supplies to the kingdom by 60 percent in 1999,
the semiofficial Jordan Times reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Citing a dragging drought in the Jewish state, Israel proposed
a 60 percent cut in its annual water supplies to Jordan promised
under the 1994 Israel-Jordan peace treaty.
</P>
<P>
The proposal was rejected by a Jordanian delegation during a
bilateral meeting in Jerusalem on Sunday, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
"Jordan wants to make it clear that the peace accord has set up
our legitimate water shares, and it has nothing to do with a
drought in Israel," Jordan Times quoted an unnamed official in the
Jordanian delegation as saying.
</P>
<P>
According to the peace treaty, Israel extracts 12 million cubic
meters of water from the Yarmouk River from May 15 to October 15
annually, and Jordan gets the rest of the river's flow.
</P>
<P>
From October 16 to May 14, Israel pumps out 13 million cubic
meters of water from the Yarmouk river, and Jordan allows Israel
to pump an additional 20 million cubic meters from the river.
</P>
<P>
In return for the additional water, Israel promised to
transfer 20 million cubic meters of water to Jordan through the
Jordan River in summer time.
</P>
<P>
Israel assured Jordan last December that it would comply with
the water clauses in the peace treaty, refuting statements by its
Agriculture Minister Rafael Eitan that it would reconsider the
water supplies to Jordan in 1999 due to the drought.
</P>
<P>
His remarks prompted Israeli Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon to
send an official clarification to Amman, saying Israel would stand
by all its commitments in the peace treaty, including water.

<P>
LUSAKA, March 15 (Xinhua) -- The Royal Netherlands Police have
joined the Federal Bureau of Investigations (FBI) of the United
States in trying to find who was behind a spate of bombings that
had rocked Lusaka two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
Dutch ambassador to Zambia, Nim De Beers, confirmed the arrival
of a team from his country to help with investigations that would
establish who was behind 14 bombs that had exploded in Lusaka,
leaving vital infrastructure destroyed.

Zambia Daily Mail newspaper on Monday quoted De Beer as saying
that the team has already arrived in the country and is working
with the U.S. investigation group in its operation.
</P>
<P>
He said the team's work is progressing well and hopefully it
would soon conclude its work.

The ambassador said the Dutch team will give its findings to
the Zambian government so that the government could be in a better

place in late February.
</P>
<P>
De Beers said the Dutch team had come into Zambia at the
request of the Zambian government, which is seeking to have an

<HEADLINE> Turkish President Calls for Pressure on Greece </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, March 15 (Xinhua) -- Turkish President Suleyman
Demirel called again for international pressure on Greece to stop
what Ankara terms Greece's support for terrorism.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Daily News published on here Monday,
Demirel said he expects the "civilized world" to pressure Athens
into abiding by its treaty obligations and stop supporting
terrorist acts.
</P>
<P>
He warned that if Greece continues its behavior, there will be
sanctions that Turkey would take, but he did not elaborate.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has long accused Greece of aiding the outlawed Kurdish
Workers Party (PKK), a charged denied by Athens.
</P>
<P>
Relations between the two long-time foes worsened after the
capture of the PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan last month. Ocalan was
kidnaped by Turkish commandos when he was leaving the residence of
Greek Ambassador to Nairobi, Kenya, where he had taken shelter for
12 days.
</P>
<P>
Turkey held Ocalan, now jailed in a prison on Imrali Island in
Marmara Sea near western Turkey, responsible for leading the PKK
in launching a 15-year-old guerrilla war for an independent
Kurdish state in southeastern Turkey, which has claimed over
37,000 lives since August 1984.

<TEXT>
<P>
RIO DE JANEIRO, March 14 (Xinhua) -- Rai, captain of the 1994
World Cup champions Brazilian side, will make a comeback next
month from a seven-month injury layoff, it was reported here on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The 34-year-old midfielder, who pulled his left knee ligament
in a national championship match last August, has resumed practice
recently and plans to return to action for his club Sao Paulo in
April.
</P>
<P>
"I will be as good as the lads, though now I'm a grandfather,"
Rai, whose daughter gave birth to a baby boy last year, told
reporters.
</P>
<P>
But he quickly ruled out any hopes of being selected to the
national squad.
</P>
<P>
"I had my good old days. But now it's time for Ronaldo and
Rivaldo," said Rai, who made his last appearance in the famous
golden shirt just before the 1998 World Cup finals. But he was
eventually dropped out by the then Brazilian coach Mario Zagallo.
</P>
<P>
Rai, whose contract with Sao Paulo expires next year, said
after that he wants to get a try at the English soccer before
quitting the game for good.
</P>
<P>
He will then concentrate on a the Youth Soccer Fund, which he
set up jointly with his once-time national teammate, AC Milan
midfielder Leonardo.

<HEADLINE> New Trends for Chinese Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 15 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese government is
drafting measures aimed at accelerating economic growth by
increasing consumer spending this year.
</P>
<P>
According to an article in the latest issue of Outlook, a major
weekly magazine in China, China formerly relied on investment to
achieve economic growth. Now, however, the country hopes to
stimulate economic growth by expanding both investment and
consumption, the so-called "two wheels" which will support
economic increase this year.
</P>
<P>
China recently abolished several outdated measures on
consumption restrictions, and lowered both the cost of electricity
in rural areas and telecommunications service fees.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government will focus its attention on improving
the quality of economic growth rather than simply economic growth-
rate figures, as a result of several defective infrastructure
projects brought to light last year.
</P>
<P>
China increased investment in infrastructure projects by 100
billion yuan last year in order to realize the goal of maintaining
an eight percent economic growth rate.
</P>
<P>
Private businesses will also have more room for development
this year, as they are now constitutionally a component of China's
economy, and the private economy is expected to become a strong
driving force behind economic growth.

<HEADLINE> Zambia's Electricity Export Decreases Last Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, March 15 (Xinhua) -- Zambia's electricity exports
decreased last year with the value of export for January to
September amounting to 3.6 million U.S. dollars, as compared with
11.9 million dollars for the same period in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The 1998 Economic Report by the country's finance ministry
attributed this fall mainly to the import reduction by neighboring
Zimbabwe, which imports over 80 percent of Zambia's electricity
exports.
</P>
<P>
The Bank of Zambia also said in its latest annual report that
increased electricity production in the importing countries,
Zimbabwe in particular, led to their reduction in importation of
Zambia's electricity.
</P>
<P>
The report said electricity generation from January to November
of last year fell by 4.7 percent and stood at less than seven
million MWH in 1998 compared with over seven million MWH in 1997.
</P>
<P>
"The fall in electricity generation was due to the significant
decline in the electricity exports and sluggish demand by the
Zambia Consolidated Copper Mines (ZCCM)," the report said.
</P>
<P>
ZCCM's electricity consumption dropped as its production was
reduced. ZCCM is still in process of privatization and needs huge
capital investment.
</P>
<P>
The electrictiy generation at the main hydro-power stations
fell by 4.6 percent in the period under review, the report said.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh Targets 6.4 Percent GDP Growth Next Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, March 15 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh's national budget for
the 1999-2000 fiscal year is being prepared with an ambitious
target of achieving a 6.4-percent growth in the gross domestic
product (GDP), the Bangladesh Observer daily reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The expected growth is significantly higher than the estimated
3.8 percent growth for the current fiscal year ending June 30, the
daily said.
</P>
<P>
The budget will pursue an action plan to achieve the targeted
GDP growth by the year 2000, the newspaper quoted Finance Ministry
sources as saying.
</P>
<P>
The action plan is aimed at intensifying the government's
efforts to dispel policy uncertainty, instill business confidence
and strengthen macro-economic management, they said.
</P>
<P>
Like previous years, the budget for the 1999-2000 fiscal year
will give priority to reducing fiscal deficit by improving tax
collection, controlling current expenditure and terminating
less-important development projects from the Annual Development
Program (ADP).
</P>
<P>
The budget is also likely to provide some special incentives to
increase export earnings and accelerate industrialization.
</P>
<P>
Export earnings during the next fiscal year are expected to be
around 6.3 billion U.S. dollars, 9.4 percent higher than that of
the current fiscal year's estimated 5.8 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The industrial sector as a whole is projected to grow by 8.7
percent, mainly due to a pickup in the large-scale manufacturing
sector, which was growing by 5 percent during the current fiscal
year and is expected to expand by 10 percent in the next fiscal
year.
</P>
<P>
The agriculture sector, mostly affected by last year's
devastating floods, will be given priority in the Annual
Development Plan, and annual growth in the sector is expected to
be 8.7 percent by the year 2000.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 15 (Xinhua) -- The principals in ten major
consumer disputes are receiving free legal assistance in the
ongoing fight to protect their rights.
</P>
<P>
This assistance is being arranged by the Legal Affairs
Department and the Management Committee of the Jianhao Legal
Assistance Fund of the China Consumers News.
</P>
<P>
Among the beneficiaries are 200 elderly consumers who filed a
complaint against the China Martial Arts Association (CMAA).
</P>
<P>
They were among the l0,000 elderly who were asked to pay 40
yuan (about 5 U.S. dollars) for outfits to be worn during a
Taijiquan competition at Tiananmen Square last October. The
dispute arose from the poor quality of the clothing.
</P>
<P>
Another case involves a consumer in the city of Zhumadian in
Henan Province who spent 3,500 yuan to buy a pair of Swiss Titoni
brand watches which later were verified by a quality supervision
center in Beijing to be counterfeit products. The consumer then
filed a complaint against the department store that sold him the
watches.
</P>
<P>
Other cases concern an irresponsible travel agency, poor-
quality seed strains, cheating in the sales of mail-order
commodities, and delays in the transport of goods.

<P>
NAIROBI, March 15 (Xinhua) -- Three of Kenya's four major
commercial banks are to lay off hundreds of employees in new
cost-cutting measures aimed at enhancing profits, a leading
regional newspaper The East African reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Barclays Bank has revealed it would shed about 700 out of its
3,400 employees. The year-long reduction has just started and the
first 340 employees are expected to leave by June 30.
</P>
<P>
Kenya Commercial Bank and the National Bank are to make similar
 announcements this week. The boards of the two banks were said to
have held emergency meetings over the past two weeks and are
scheduled to hold further meetings before announcing their lay-off
plans.
</P>
<P>
Kenya Commercial Bank is expected to retrench its staff by 800
from 4,200 and the National Bank of Kenya is planning to cut
between 350 and 400 of its 1,350-strong staff.
</P>
<P>
The drastic reductions by the three banks will affect all
categories of staff, from management to low-level employees.
</P>
<P>
Central Bank of Kenya estimates that the banking sector holds
about 1.3 billion U.S. dollars in bad debts, which requires
commercial banks to take measures to regain credibility.

<HEADLINE> Coles Urged to Quit Sydney Games Board </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, March 15 (Xinhua) -- Australian International Olympic
Committee (IOC) member Phil Coles faced mounting pressure on
Monday to quit the board of the committee organizing Sydney's 2000
Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
An earlier IOC inquiry has recommended that Coles, 67, be given
a "most serious warning" over revelations that he had accepted
free travel receptions to the United States from 2002 Winter
Olympic Games bidders Salt Lake City.
</P>
<P>
New South Wales state premier Bob Carr became the latest of
officials and politicians who had urged Coles to resign from the
board.
</P>
<P>
"I'm told that's the view of the majority of his fellow members
on the organizing committee and, if that's the case, I think it's
probably best for all if he does that," Carr was quoted in an
interview with Australia's Channel Seven television network.
</P>
<P>
Coles resigned on Friday from his post as international
relations director for the Australian Olympic Committee. But his
IOC member status makes him still entitled to sit on the SOCOG
board.
</P>
<P>
A former Olympic canoeist, Coles has also been urged to resign
by the state's Olympics minister and SOCOG president Michael
Knight, and has been severely criticized by Kevan Gosper, another
Australian IOC member.
</P>
<P>
The SOCOG board was expected to discuss Coles's future at
Monday's meeting in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
Coles stood aside temporarily from the SOCOG board and was not
due to attend the Sydney meeting.

JERUSALEM, March 15 (Xinhua) -- Some 80,000 Israeli civil
servants started their strike Monday morning after the Labor
Federation and the Treasury failed on Sunday to solve the wage
disputes.
</P>
<P>
Due to the strike, outpatient clinics in government hospitals
were closed, the Interior Ministry stopped to issue passports and
identity cards, the Customs Authority refused to release goods
waiting in the ports, and neither the courts nor the National
Insurance Institutes receive the public.
</P>
<P>
It is not clear how long the strike will last, but the Civil
Service Commissioner Shmuel Hollander has told heads of government
offices that employees who do not work will not be paid.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the civil servants' stoppage, nearly 400,000
other public sector employees have threatened an open-ended strike
at the beginning of next week to protest the government's
opposition to wage increases, said the Labor Federation.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued by the Finance Ministry on Sunday said it is
preparing for a long and difficult strike, given the Labor
Federation's excessive demands in public sector collective
bargaining talks.
</P>
<P>
Finance Minister Meir Sheetrit has agreed that the public
sector wages be adjusted for inflation, translating into a 3.8
percent rise, far below the Labor Federation demanded.
</P>
<P>
The Finance Ministry's deputy spokesman Aviram Cohen said
Sunday that Sheetrit had given his assurance to protect worker's
salaries, but refuses to cave in to the outrageous Federation
demand for 16 percent wage hike.
</P>
<P>
Each percent is some 200 million U.S. dollars and if the
Finance Ministry gives in to their demands, it will lead to the
collapse of the entire economy.
</P>
<P>
Salary has become a major problem for the government.
Employees at the Defense Ministry started their strike last week
for wage increase, while workers of Israel's largeest telephone
company Bezeq walked out of their work beginning Friday.

<HEADLINE> More People in Xinjiang Shake off Poverty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, March 15 (Xinhua) -- The Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous
region in northwest China brought 300,000 more rural residents out
of poverty last year thanks to economic development and increased
grain output.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, the average net per capita income of farmers in 30
poverty-stricken counties reached 1,000 yuan, 100 yuan more than
in 1997, and the region's poverty rate declined from 17 percent in
1995 to 6 percent in 1998, according to the autonomous region's
poverty-relief department.
</P>
<P>
But Xinjiang still has 500,000 people living below the poverty
line, with an average net per capita income of less than 670 yuan
a year.
</P>
<P>
Most of these people live in the southern part of the region,
including Hotan, Kizil, and Kashi, and the pastoral areas in the
northern part. Their poverty is caused mainly by a weak economy,
poor access to transport, and harsh natural conditions.
</P>
<P>
Over the past few years, the central government paid special
attention to the work of poverty-relief in the far northwest
region of the country, and listed aid-the-poor projects as part of
China's efforts to narrow the gap between the eastern and western
parts of the nation.
</P>
<P>
The central government invested a record 970 million yuan last
year in poverty-relief work, with local government supporting
funds amounting to 200 million yuan. About 90 percent of this
money was spent to build water and electricity projects, roads,
and other infrastructure facilities.
</P>
<P>
As a result, roads in the 30 poverty-stricken counties were
increased by 2,000 kilometers,, and most of the villages now have
access to electricity and telecommunications. The drinking-water
problem was also solved.
</P>
<P>
In addition, taxes were either reduced or exempted for poor
people, made possible by an autonomous regional government subsidy
of 15 million yuan last year.

<HEADLINE> Kenya to Teach Local Tongues at Varsity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, March 15 (Xinhua) -- Three tribal Kenyan languages,
namely Kikuyu, Dholuo and Luhya, are to be taught at Nairobi
University from the next academic year, a linguistics professor
has said.
</P>
<P>
G.M. Nyombe, Chairman of the Linguistics and African Languages
Department at the university, said the courses have been
introduced in response to the country's current financial,
academic and cultural needs, the weekly East African reported
Monday.
</P>
<P>
The selection of the three languages was based on the results
of the 1989 population census, which listed the Kikuyu, Luhya and
Luo as the largest ethnic communities.
</P>
<P>
At present, the only African language taught at the university
in Kenya is Kiswahili. It is taught together with English in the
formal education programs.
</P>
<P>
Nyombe noted that "the suppression of local languages has
forced Africans to remain intellectually dependent on foreign
scientific and cultural prescriptions because local languages are
assumed not to be developed enough to meet the country's needs."
</P>
<P>
The professor said the language center of his department would
start with a service unit, which should be operational in August,
with its initial objective to provide services to individuals and
groups.
</P>
<P>
One of the language center's first tasks, he added, is to
translate the Kenya's constitution and laws into Kiswahili and the
three ethnic languages from the existing linguistic
characteristics of a given language.

<HEADLINE> Elections Only Solution to Afghan Issue: Iran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, March 15 (Xinhua) -- An leading Iranian newspaper on
Monday called for "free and fair elections" to be held in
Afghanistan in order to put an end to the country's
two-decade-long bloodshed.
</P>
<P>
In a commentary on Sunday's landmark agreement reached between
Afghan warring factions, Tehran Times said that "such a
breakthrough, although a positive step in itself, cannot lead to
a durable peace in Afghanistan."
</P>
<P>
The Taliban militia who control over 90 percent of the country
and the opposition Northern Alliance led by President Burhanuddin
Rabbani, on Sunday agreed on a joint government, exchange of
prisoners of war and continuation of peace talks.
</P>
<P>
However, Tehran Times, believed to close to the Foreign
Ministry, regretted that neither the Northern Alliance nor the
Taliban have ever tried to hold nationwide elections in that
country to solve the crisis.
</P>
<P>
It noted that only free and fair elections under U.N.
supervision will pave the way for the Afghan people to shape a
broad-based government based on national will and harmony.
</P>
<P>
Iran and Pakistan, two big neighbors, welcomed the Afghan
factions' accord reached in Ashkhabad, Turkmenistan under the
auspices of the U.N.. They hoped it would pave the way for
restoration of peace in the war-torn country.
</P>
<P>
Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Hamid Reza Asefi said on
Sunday that Iran welcomes the agreements to continue talks in
order to bring about a lasting peace through the formation of a
broad-based government, composed of all Afghan ethnic groups.
</P>
<P>
He expressed hope that war and bloodshed would be halted in
Afghanistan through establishment of a cease-fire and further
talks involved all Afghan parties, tribes and ethnic groups would
prepare the ground for formation of a popular, independent and
non-aligned government in Afghanistan.

<HEADLINE> 800 Congolese Soldiers Flee Into Zambia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, March 15 (Xinhua) -- At least 800 armed Congolese
soldiers running away from a rebel offensive in Democratic
Republic of Congo (DRC) have fled into Zambia through Kaputa in
Northern Province in the last few days, Times of Zambia newspaper
reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The paper, quoted Kaputa District Council senior administrative
official Evaristo Kafwembela and Parliament Member Samuel Mukupa,
as saying that another 10,000 civilians including some French
settlers who escaped from the war have also crossed into Zambia.
</P>
<P>
Kafwembela, who had just arrived from Kaputa, told the paper
Sunday that 800 plus soldiers who entered Zambia through the
Muchenja border post about 15 kilometers from Kaputa surrendered
themselves to Zambian authorities and voluntarily handed over
their weapons.
</P>
<P>
They are camped at the Minestone shed where the United Nations
High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), Zambia Army and other aid
agencies have put up temporary structures for shelter.
</P>
<P>
Mukupa, who expressed worries that the armed soldiers coming
into Zambia are too many, has called for serious action by the
government.
</P>
<P>
He also worried that the large number of foreigners coming in
could compound the problem in Kaputa, a cholera infested area.
</P>
<P>
"We have had refugees coming in for a long time, but this
figure, 10,000 plus, is an all time high. We may not be competent
enough to handle the situation especially that there are armed
people involved, " he said.
</P>
<P>
The situation is so bad that some French settlers running away
from the war are now in Zambia with all their belongings including
farm animals, he said.
</P>
<P>
More Zambian defense personnel in the region are being
mobilized to go to the area, he added.

The front is located at eastern Tigray region. Ethiopia accused
Eritrean troops of occupying the border town Zalambessa on June 9
last year.
</P>
<P>
However, an official in the office of the Ethiopian
government spokesperson, Haile Kiros, said there were just
cross-border artillery shellings at Tsorona and other fronts.

Fighting had died down since February 27 when Eritrea accepted
the framework agreement put forward by the Organization of African
Unity (OAU).

Only occasional border skirmishes and cross-border shellings
occur on the Badme and Zalambessa front, some 30 kilometers to the

MANILA, march 15 (Xinhua) -- The Asian Development Bank
announced here Monday that it has approved a regional technical
assistance grant of 400,000 U.S. dollars to prepare a

In a statement issued here, the Manila-based bank said that
micro-finance -- providing the poor with loans, savings facilities

a powerful tool for poverty reduction and has been particularly

However, it said, despite the rapid growth in micro-finance
services in the region, an estimated less than 5 percent of poor
households in the Asia and Pacific region have access to formal
financial services.
</P>
<P>
The ADB's strategy will include expanding access of the poor to
such services, the bank said.
</P>
<P>
An ADB task force on micro-finance will carry out in-country
consultations in several bank's developing members, it said.
</P>
<P>
The bank said that other activities under the technical
assistance will include a regional workshop in Manila to obtain
further inputs for the strategy and a study of the role of central
banks in micro-finance development.

WASHINGTON, March 14 (Xinhua) -- Spain's Carlos Moya may be the
new No. 1 player in the world, but Australia's Mark Philippoussis
was the top player on the court Sunday in California.
</P>
<P>
Philippoussis utilized his biggest weapon serve to wear down
the fourth-seeded Moya in the final set and post a 5-7, 6-4, 6-4,
4-6, 6-2 victory in the day's five-set final of the 2.2 million U.
S. dollars Champions Cup ATP tournament in Indian Wells.
</P>
<P>
The Australian broke Moya twice in the final set before
sealing his first Super 9 title in just under three hours with his
23rd ace on match point.
</P>
<P>
"It feels great," Philippoussis said. "It's extra special
knowing that Carlos was No. 1 in the world. I played some great
tennis today. I was just very pleased."

<P>
By reaching the final here, Moya will take the world's top

37 points. The Spaniard would have held a 190-point lead over
Sampras with a victory on Sunday.

<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, March 15 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lankan President Chandrika
Kumaratunga has ordered a full scale three-pronged inquiry into
the incident which led to the abduction and assault of a local
journalist, officials said Monday.
</P>
<P>
They said the three-tiered inquiry will comprise independent
inquiries from the army, the police and a special investigation by
the Criminal Investigation Department.
</P>
<P>
Srilal Priyantha of the independent Sinhalese language
newspaper, the Lakbima (Motherland), was abducted from his
boarding house, brutally assaulted and tied to a tree in the early
hours of Sunday morning.
</P>
<P>
A gang of ten unidentified thugs visited Priyantha's lodgings
at Nugegoda in the suburbs of Colombo, blindfolded him and took
him away in a vehicle to Kalubowila, about five miles away.
</P>
<P>
There, in a deserted block of land they had assaulted him,
placed him in two jute bags and tied him to a tree. Neighbors had
later come to his rescue and taken him to hospital.
</P>
<P>
Political and Defense analysts along with the national media
attribute this to be an act of individuals who have resented a
series of investigative reports which the journalist had written
in his weekly column.
</P>
<P>
In his column titled "Allas saha Dooshana" (Bribery and
Corruption), he had highlighted a series of corrupt practices in
the armed forces and the police department and also in a number of
government departments and corporations.
</P>
<P>
The paper had also on Sunday carried an exposure by him of how
an army brigadier had led a military terror gang to mercilessly
assault a woman and abduct her husband.

<HEADLINE> Rodman Takes Leave of Absense from LA Lakers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 14 (Xinhua) -- Los Angeles Lakers forward
Dennis Rodman did not accompany the team for Sunday's game against
the Sacramento Kings and has taken an indefinite leave of absence.
</P>
<P>
Lakers spokesman John Black said that the flamboyant Rodman,
who has helped the Lakers extend their winning streak to 10 games,
left the team for unspecified personal reasons.
</P>
<P>
"Dennis asked for and has been granted a leave of absence,"
Black said Sunday morning. "That is all that has been determined
at this time."
</P>
<P>
Black said it was uncertain when Rodman would return to the
Lakers, who open a six-game, nine-day road trip this evening.
</P>
<P>
When the Lakers signed Rodman last month, they knew they were
acquiring a player who keeps management on its toes with his
unpredictable mood swings and disdain for rules. As a result, the
Lakers initally are downplaying the latest development.
</P>
<P>
"I'm not going to freak out about it," coach Kurt Rambis said.
"It's just something we're going to have to deal with."
</P>
<P>
Rodman did not practice Saturday, his second missed practice
in a week, but did meet briefly with Rambis, Black said.
</P>
<P>
The seven-time NBA rebounding champion signed with the Lakers
on February 23 and has averaged 10.3 rebounds in nine games. He
sat out the second half of Friday's win over the Golden State
Warroirs because of a score elbow.
</P>
<P>
The latest development continues a turbulent season for the
Lakers, who make a blockbuster trade with the Charlotte Hornets on
Wednesday, acquiring Glen Rice and J.R. Reid.
</P>
<P>
One day after signing Rodman, the Lakers fired head coach Del
Harris and hired Rambis. Rodman is being paid of a pro-rated sum
of 468,000 U.S. dollars by the Lakers after making nine million U.
S. dollars last season.

<P>
NEW DELHI, March 15 (Xinhua) -- The Indian Union government is
likely to further relax its imports limits in its new amendments
to the Export-Import policy to be announced at the end of this
month, a government official said here Monday.
</P>
<P>
The government is slated to liberalize imports of about 400
items by putting them on the open general licence (OGL) list in
the coming Export-Import policy. The items will include
disc-operated record players, tape recorders of certain kinds,
digital loop carrier systems electronic fuses, cookers and kitchen
stoves, picture frames, sinks and wash basins, pocket knives,
soaps, washing preparations, handbags, electrical calculating
machines, etc.
</P>
<P>
Besides, another 250-300 items are expected to be moved from
the restricted to the special import licence (SIL) list.
</P>
<P>
Pressurized by Western countries, India has made a plan to
phase out quantitative restrictions of its imports. The import of
around 740-odd items are to be freed in the first phase of three
years and this is the third year of the first phase. The second
phase is of two years of 2000-2002 and the third phase is one
year-- 2002-2003.

<HEADLINE> Bankruptcy Law to Help Spur Economy: Thai Central Bank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, March 15 (Xinhua) -- The Bankruptcy law, passed by the
Thai Senate last Friday, will help restore commercial banks'
confidence and thus speed up the recovering process in Thai
economy, a senior official of the Bank of Thailand (BOT), the
country's central bank, said here Monday.
</P>
<P>
BOT Deputy Governor Kitti Patpongpibul said that with the law,
the pace of financial and corporate restructuring processes would
be quickened as local lenders, namely commercial banks, would be
more willing to extend new loans for businesses due to better
chance of recovering their money.
</P>
<P>
"The law, expected to be implemented by the end of this month,
will help restore and boost lenders' confidence because they
realize that their lending will be protected," he said when asked
to comment on the law.
</P>
<P>
Lenders' great willingness would help hundreds of cash-strapped
businesses to carry on operations and have revenues to repay for
debt services, he said.
</P>
<P>
Business leaders here hailed the passage of the bill, saying
that it would not only help raise lenders' confidence, but also
boost foreign investors' sentiment and their willingness to invest
more in Thailand.
</P>
<P>
Under the existing law, a party that injected fresh funds into
a business that is at risk would not be able to recover the money.
Therefore, few lenders were willing to help troubled clients
though prospects of rehabilitating the business were good.

<P>
WASHINGTON, March 14 (Xinhua) -- Evander Holyfield and Lennox
Lewis, who fought to a controversial draw for the undisputed
heavyweight title, have been ordered by leaders of the world's
major professional organizations to fight a rematch within six
months.
</P>
<P>
Presidents of the International Boxing Federation (IBF), World
Boxing Association (WBA) and World Boxing Council (WBC) made the
order on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Many though Lewis had won the bout, but the referees made it
115-115.
</P>
<P>
"I am in disbelief," said Lewis after the 12-round match ended
early Sunday in Madison Square Garden.
</P>
<P>
Bob Lee if IBF, Jose Sulaiman of the WBC and Gilberto Mendoz of
the WBA met after the fight.
</P>
<P>
"It's a shame there was so much controversy attached to this
important fight," IBF president Lee said. "But we did what we
thought was the most sensible thing by ordering a rematch in six
months."
</P>
<P>
Holyfield holds IBF and WBA titles while Lewis is the WBC
champion.
</P>
<P>
IBF judge Jean Williams of Atlantic City, voted 115-113 for
Holyfield. WBA judge Stanley Christodoulou of South Africa had it
116-113 for Lewis. WBC judge Larry O'Connell of Britain called
the fight even at 115-115.
</P>
<P>
"I don't care who the winner is. I scored by the blows that
connected," said Williams, who thought Holyfield won even though
he landed 218 fewer punches.
</P>
<P>
Christodoulou said: "I think that many think it was a travesty
of justice. I really believe Holyfield lost this fight. But they
might have the same conviction about their decisions."
</P>
<P>
O'Connell said he expected criticism from British fans.
</P>
<P>
"I know I'll get some stick, but it's my decision to call the
fight as I see it," he said. "It's all part and parcel of the job
and when I score each round, I never know what the overall score
is going to be."
</P>
<P>
Lewis landed 348 of 613 punches to 130 of 385 for Holyfield,
and in each of six rounds, Holyfield landed fewer than 10 punches.
</P>
<P>
"I feel that I am the undisputed heavyweight champion," lewis
said. "This was a situation where politics was involved. When
you've got a fight of this magnitude. I'm not saying Don King had
anything to do with it, but this is one of his shows. I am in
America."

Neurosurgical Congress which concluded here Sunday. The three-day
congress was organized by the Nepalese Society of Clinical
Neurosciences under the theme of "regional collaboration in
neurosurgery."
</P>
<P>
The South Asian Neurosurgical Society will soon be registered
as an apex body of the South Asian Association for Regional
Cooperation (SAARC), Dr. Upendra Devkota, chairman of the
organizing committee of the congress, told Xinhua Monday.
</P>
<P>
Nepal now holds the chairmanship of the South Asian
Neurosurgical Society which will be handed over to Bangladesh in
2001 when the country hosts the next regional congress on
neurosurgery in its capital city of Dhaka, he said.
</P>
<P>
He described the first congress as "very, very successful,"
saying that over 130 excellent papers were presented at the
meeting with a full audience all the time.
</P>
<P>
He said work will be done on generating regional cooperation in
research, services, exchange programs and eventually training.
</P>
<P>
"This congress has laid a firm foundation for consolidation and
furtherance of neurosurgical fraternity and successfully
established the conspicuous forum for exchange of the experiences
to harness the future strategy for delivery of effective
neurosurgical service, training and research in the region," the
organizer said in a press release.
</P>
<P>
Due to its peculiar socioeconomic and geopolitical situation,
the South Asia region is not optimally equipped in terms of
resources to deal with the devastating disorders of the brain,
Devkota said.
</P>
<P>
He said in Nepal alone, the annual incidence of head injuries
is about 120,000, of which 10 percent are severe.
</P>
<P>
Five of SAARC's seven member countries, Bangladesh, India,
Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka were represented at the congress
which is also attended by representatives from the United States,
Britain, Germany, Japan, Hong Kong and Singapore.
</P>
<P>
Bhutan and the Maldives did not take part in the congress.

<HEADLINE> Philippines Lowers Overnight Lending Rates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 15 (Xinhua) -- The Monetary Board of the
Philippine Central Bank Monday reduced its overnight and other
term rates anew to further the downtrend in domestic interest
rates and encourage greater commercial lending by banks.
</P>
<P>
The move is complemented by the decision of the government to
slash its 5.5-billion-peso (about 137.5 million U.S. dollars)
weekly Treasury-bill offer to around 4 billion pesos (about 100
million dollars), meaning that the fiscal sector is not in dire
need of domestic loans.
</P>
<P>
The two decisions take effect Monday, according to Central Bank
Governor Gabriel Singson and Finance Secretary Edgardo Espiritu.
</P>
<P>
The overnight borrowing and lending rates now stand at 12.125
percent and 14.125 percent -- down by 12.5 basis points from 12.25
percent and 14.25 percent respectively.
</P>
<P>
This is the second downward adjustment in the overnight and
term rates in just a week's time -- the first one was done in
March 8 this year when the central bank decreased the overnight
rates by 25 basis points.
</P>
<P>
These facilities are used by monetary authorities in either
siphoning off or releasing liquidity into the system to regulate
economic activity.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 15 (Xinhua) -- Deputy Minister of Construction
Song Chunhua recently called on the construction industry to
introduce measures to solve problems related to substandard
quality within four years.
</P>
<P>
A recent survey revealed substandard levels for approximately
10 percent of residential houses built in major cities during 1998,
down significantly on the 40 percent level in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
An increasing number of Chinese citizens have voiced
dissatisfaction with the poor quality of their houses, said Song.
</P>
<P>
Statistics provided by the China National Consumers Association
show that the number of complaints nationwide concerning defective
houses rose by 50 percent in 1998 from the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Song attributed the rising complaints to the fact that
construction companies lack adequate expertise to determine
project quality. He urged related government departments at all
levels to strengthen inspections of construction projects to
ensure quality and consolidate the existing disorderly
construction market.

<HEADLINE> Mindanao Shows Signs of Economic Recovery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 15 (Xinhua) -- The economy in the Philippines'
southern island of Mindanao is showing signs of recovery as the
island's six regions posted lower inflation rates in February this
year, with only two of the regions registering double-digit
inflation rates.
</P>
<P>
Data from the National Statistics Office (NSO) released Sunday
said that inflation rate in the southern island, with a population
of more than 3 million Muslim Filipinos, dropped by 0.4 percent in
February.
</P>
<P>
NSO said the "improving inflation rates of the six regions show
Mindanao is gradually recovering from the economic crisis and the
damage wrought to agriculture and infrastructure because of the
bad weather that stuck Mindanao regions."
</P>
<P>
The drop in inflation rates in all the six Mindanao regions
pulled down the overall rate of Mindanao to 8.8 percent from 9.2
percent registered in January.
</P>
<P>
This rate is also lower than the national inflation rate of 9.9
percent, the NSO said. The national inflation rate in January was
11.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
The purchasing power of the peso in Mindanao remained at 0.70
peso in February, meaning a basket of goods (and services) worth
70 pesos in 1994 is worth 100 pesos in February 1999.

<HEADLINE> Fake Seeds Top Rising Complaints from Chinese Farmers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 15 (Xinhua) -- Bad and fake seed, poor breeding
stock, inferior chemical fertilizer and farm equipment are the
biggest threats to rural consumers' interests and safety, said a
senior official with the China Consumers Association (CCA).
</P>
<P>
"Our 900 million rural consumers create enormous business
opportunities for manufactures. However, these consumers' rights
have not been properly protected," CCA Secretary-General Yang
Shukun recently said in anticipation of World Consumer Rights Day,
Which is being observed today.
</P>
<P>
During the past year, 30,000 complaints were filed against fake
and shoddy farming products and equipment, CCA statistics
indicated.
</P>
<P>
These complaints represented a 30 percent increase over the
figure the year before, several times the growth in complaints
about other products or services, which averaged 6.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
Bad seed, poor breeding stock and inferior chemical fertilizer
have ruthlessly crushed many rural consumers' hopes for harvest.
In some cases, farmers have been left with nothing to live on,
today's China Daily quoted Yang as saying.
</P>
<P>
He voiced grave concerns over roughly manufactured products for
farm use, which pose a direct threat to rural consumers' lives and
health.
</P>
<P>
About 10,000 cases of pesticide poisoning are reported every
year. They are often caused by highly toxic farm chemicals leaking
form sub-standard sprayers.
</P>
<P>
With a goal of protecting rural consumers' rights, CCA unveiled
a series of campaigns under the theme "For the Benefits of Rural
Consumers" last January, by conducting a nationwide survey to
assess rural consumers' sense of self-protection and to learn more
about infringements on their rights.
</P>
<P>
Based on the survey results, CCA focused its efforts on
expanding rural consumers' access to quality test and complaint-
handling centers.
</P>
<P>
Last year, village-level complaint-handling centers increased
to 67,123, up 16 percent from 1997.

<HEADLINE> Shenzhen Increases Fixed Assets Input through Cutting Red-tapes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENZHEN, March 15 (Xinhua) -- Shenzhen, China's oldest special
economic zone, has established a financial system that enables
sustained investment increases for infrastructure construction
with government providing only macro-control and indirect
interference.
</P>
<P>
The city has had 299.5 billion yuan in fixed assets investment
in the past 18 years since the zone was founded, with an annual
growth of 42 percent, with company spending accounting for 60
percent, bank loans for 15 percent, and government spending for
only 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
As the financial market grew, the city found more ways to
finance by issuing convertible bonds overseas and accumulating
capital on the stock market. The city has one of China's two stock
markets, which has helped get 36.6 billion yuan for Chinese
companies.
</P>
<P>
The city government has changed its role to adapt itself to the
market economy system with Chinese characteristics. It now gives
guidance rather than issuing order on fixed assets development and
has provided a relaxed but orderly financial environment. It
recently cut more than 58 percent of unnecessary red-tapes and is
introducing a public hearing mechanism and consultation into
decision making to improve the transparency of governance. This
has demonstrated its determination keep government apart from
enterprises.

<HEADLINE> More People Escape Poverty In Northwestern China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, March 15 (Xinhua)-- Nearly 380,000 additional people in
Northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region have escaped
poverty in the past year, thanks to increased government spending.
</P>
<P>
Xinjiang set a poverty line of 670 yuan and it still has over
half a million people below this line. A autonomous regional
government official in the poverty relief office attributes the
success to increased spending by both the central and local
governments last year.
</P>
<P>
The central government allocated 970 million yuan on poverty
relief projects, and local regional government spent additional
200 million yuan, with 90 percent of that going to plants, animal
raising, and infrastructure in mountainous and desert areas.
</P>
<P>
Last year, 30 poor counties added more than 2,000 km of roads
and most villages have electricity, postal service, and drinking
water.

</P>
<P>
-- China will not increase imports of textile machinery in the
next few years, said Chen Bin, an official with the State
Administration of Textile Industry.
</P>
<P>
-- China plans to encourage 50 large and medium-sized
machinery and electronics manufacturers to open plants in Latin
America and Africa to increase exports, Xu Bingjin, assistant
minister of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation (MOFTEC), said
last Monday in Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
-- Microsoft will conduct an extensive test on the Chinese
version of its new business software suite, Office 2000, starting
from March 15. China also signed agreements with the US software
giant in Shenzhen to promote the use of authentic software and
crack down on copyright privacy.
</P>
<P>
-- Chevron, the US oil giant, is to commit 60 million US
dollars in its China upstream operations of oil and gas
exploration and development over the next two years.
</P>

contracts with 18 countries and regions.
</P>
<P>
-- The MOFTEC announced Wednesday that it will revoke the
import licenses of three more trading companies which have made

<P>
-- China opened its first overseas economic zone in Egypt. The
21.85-sq km zone, named China-Egypt Suez Special Economic Zone, is
located in the northwestern part of the Gulf of Suez, 140 km. from

of convenient transportation and a new deep water port on the Red
Sea.
</P>
<P>
-- The first of what is planned to be an annual spring silk
trade fair opened Thursday in Hangzhou, capital of east China's
Zhejiang Province. Nearly 100 silk enterprises are presenting over

<P>
Exports for the period were down 10.5 percent and imports were
up 4.7 percent, at 22.39 billion U.S. dollars and 18.63 billion U.
S. dollars, respectively. China's foreign-trade surplus for the
period reached 3.77 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
-- Business licenses of 97 overseas-funded enterprises in

<HEADLINE> German Minister Warns Olympics Boycott over Scandal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BERLIN, March 14 (Xinhua) -- German Interior Minister Otto
Schily was quoted Sunday as saying that he could imagine a
European boycott of the next Olympic Games if the International
Olympic Committee (IOC) fails to carry out reforms following the
current bribery scandal.
</P>
<P>
"Olympic Games in which the European countries don't
participate would be a hard blow for the IOC," Schily told
business daily Handelsblatt in an interview to appear Monday.
</P>
<P>
Germany currently holds the European Union's rotating
presidency.
</P>
<P>
Schily's remarks follow the announcement Friday night that only
one more IOC member will be recommended for expulsion in addition
to a list of five set to be expelled next week.
</P>
<P>
Schily called on the IOC to take such steps as making the
selection process more transparent, introducing term limits and
being more open about its finances.
</P>
<P>
"The IOC should very clearly recognize that the organization
has to be really cleaned up after the scandal of the past years,"
he said. "The member states of the EU will throw their entire
political weight onto the scales for that."
</P>
<P>
The IOC general assembly meet on Wednesday and Thursday after a
two-day meeting of the executive board to deal with the scandal.
</P>
<P>
Four IOC members have resigned and several leading IOC
officials have received severe warnings for being involved in the
corruption scandal currently engulfing the Olympic movement.

XI'AN, March 15 (Xinhua) -- The most severe drought in China's
Shaanxi Province in 50 years and warm temperatures have brought
pests and plant disease to a large amount of farmland, posing a
threat to this summer's crops.
</P>
<P>
For the past five months, rainfall in 90 percent of the
province's counties was 80 percent below normal and in most parts
of central and northern Shaanxi, there has not even been a drop of
rain since last autumn.
</P>
<P>
This has caused damage to 400,000 ha. of farmland, according to
local agriculture departments, and an estimated 2.7 million ha. of
farmland and grassland will suffer from pests and disease if the
drought continues and temperatures continue to rise.
</P>
<P>
The dry weather has also caused ecological deterioration in the
province and long-lasting sandstorms have hit the province since
March caused by strong cold winds.

<HEADLINE> Guangdong Province Reports Foreign Exchange Surplus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, March 15 (Xinhua) -- Banks in south China's
Guangdong Province, one of the nation's major foreign trade
powerhouses, has reported a foreign exchange surplus for the first
two months of this year in spite of the adverse impact of the
Asian financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
The 372 million US dollars surplus marked a dramactic reversal
in the depressed foreign exchange level since September last year.
</P>
<P>
An official from the Guangdong Branch of the People's Bank of
China noted the surplus was achieved by overcoming difficulties
resulting from the lingering impact of the financial crisis
engulfing Asia.
</P>
<P>
He attributed the achievement to the financial department's
efforts to strengthen penalties for individuals or enterprises
engaged in fraudulent foreign exchange deals and the emphasis
placed on stimulating export initiatives.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Doctors Urged to Avoid Malpractice </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 15 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Health Minister Zhang
Wenkang has urged to avoid medical malpractice, saying that
frequent instances of medical malpractice have damaged both
patients' health and the reputation of medical profession.
</P>
<P>
The minister admitted that the main causes of medical
malpractice were a lack of strict standards and oversight of
medical practices. In addition, stipulated measures on the
administration of health services have not been fully implemented
in many areas.
</P>
<P>
"Another reason is that some health workers lack a sense of
responsibility and do not understand what it means to provide good
medical services," Zhang was quoted by today's China Daily as
telling a national conference on discipline inspection and
workstyle rectification over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
At the ongoing Second Session of the Ninth National People's
Congress, some deputies have also voiced great concern about how
to avoid and deal with medical malpractice in hospitals.
</P>
<P>
"It is imperative for the country to map out the Public Health
Law as a fundamental guide for physicians because the existing
laws and regulations lag behind the rapid development of the
country's market economy," said Zhu Mingde, NPC deputy from
Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
The Law on Practising Physicians which strictly stipulates the
qualifications of physicians will take effect on May 1, this year.
</P>
<P>
The Health Ministry and other state departments are drafting
additional rules and amendments to the Measures for the Handling
of Medical Accidents which were implemented 12 years ago to make
it more open, scientific and impartial, Zhang Wenkang said.

NANJING, March 15 (Xinhua) -- Wuxi, in east China's Jiangsu
Province, will spend 10.5 million yuan on the Jichang Garden, one
of the most famous cultural relics south of the Yangtze River.
</P>
<P>
The garden was built during the Zhengde period of the Ming
Dynasty, from 1506 to 1522, and is the city's only state-level
cultural relic.
</P>
<P>
Although it has been renovated several times since the
establishment of New China in 1949, it had not retained its
original appearance.
</P>
<P>
So, during the current renovation, major scenic spots in the
garden will be repaired and some people living in the garden will
be relocated.

XI'AN, March 15 (Xinhua) -- Yan'an, an old revolutionary base
in northwest China's Shaanxi Province, is gradually shaking off
poverty, with the per capita income of local farmers increasing
more than 30 percent to reach 1,300 yuan in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Six counties have been taken off from the list of State-level
poverty-stricken counties, which leaves only two remaining, Mayor
Liu Xiaowen said. The fiscal income of Yan'an reached 1.23 million
yuan, up 25 percent on 1997.
</P>
<P>
The local government attributed the city's economic
achievements to the development of such products as apples,
potatoes, oil and coal.
</P>
<P>
Luochuan County, for example, reported that 80 percent of the
income of the local farmers came from the apple production last
year.
</P>

<HEADLINE> 15 Houses Burnt Down in Ambon, Indonesia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, March 15 (Xinhua) -- Fifteen houses in Soabali village
in riot-torn Ambon, capital of Indonesia's Maluku province, were
burnt down on Sunday night, according to reports reaching here
Monday.
</P>
<P>
An eyewitness told Antara News Agency that the fire broke out
at the house of the Berhitu family at around 19:00 local time
after it was left vacant by its owner.
</P>
<P>
"At that time I saw a boy entering the house of the Berhitu
family. Shortly after the boy came out of the house, it was on
fire and then he disappeared," the eyewitness said.
</P>
<P>
Nobody claimed responsibility for the fire, the reports said,
adding that local residents worked closely together in putting it
out.
</P>
<P>
The fire caused tension on Sunday although the security
authorities have since Saturday clamped down on the illegal
possession of pointed weapons and explosives.
</P>
<P>
Chief of the Ambon Military Resort Col. Karel Ralahallo called
on the conflicting parties to hand in their weapons to the
security authorities and seek a peaceful solution.
</P>
<P>
According to the reports, the security authorities have been
intensively launching a raid on the possession of pointed weapons
and explosives and anybody found carrying such weapons will be
sternly dealt with.
</P>
<P>
Located about 2,300 kilometers east of Jakarta, Ambon has been
rocked by religious unrest that has killed more than 200 people
this year. Authorities said more than 400 others were injured
since religious clashes erupted in the province in mid-January.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of people have taken refuge in mosques, churches,
military facilities and other government buildings in Ambon while
thousands of others have fled the city on ships for their
hometowns in Sulawesi.
</P>
<P>
An investigation team of an Islamic foundation found out that
the tragedy has caused more than 60,000 Muslims to leave Ambon and
returned to their hometowns.
</P>
<P>
In Ambon, about 60 percent of the population is Christian. Most
of the rest are Muslims, many of them immigrants from other
islands.
</P>
<P>
As sporadic clashes in the city continued, the Armed Forces
Commander Gen. Wiranto ordered the transfer of authority to cope
with the continuing clashes on March 11.
</P>
<P>
"Riot control has been handed over to the military because they
have a greater number of troops. We hope that from now on riot
control will be more effective," said Lt. Col. Riswadi, head of
the Maluku Police's command post.

<HEADLINE> Marcoses: Don't Call Our Wealth Ill-Gotten </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 15 (Xinhua) -- Lawyers of the Marcoses threatened
to file charges against anyone who will persist in calling the
Marcoses' wealth anything but legally-acquired riches, a local
newspaper reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
"We will confront these accusers boldly and directly," lawyers
from the Ponce Enrile Reyes and Manalastas law office said Sunday,
the newspaper Today reported.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued by publicist George Balagtas, the lawyers
said "the continuing malicious and wanton misuse of the judicial
process to malign the Marcoses should be stopped now."
</P>
<P>
This came on the eve of the pre-trial hearing of a case before
the Supreme Court which seeks the declaration of Marcos properties
and other assets, including Swiss accounts, as ill-gotten.
</P>
<P>
The lawyers said that the decision to take legal action
followed a counterclaim earlier filed by former first lady Imelda
Marcos for the return of a huge block of shares in the Philippine
Long Distance and Telephone Co. and the payment of 20.1 billion
peso (about 502.5 million U.S. dollars) for damages against the
government.
</P>
<P>
"In all civil cases pending against him (and others) before the
Supreme Court, President Marcos is charged, in colorful and
flamboyant rhetoric, with grave abuse of office by obtaining and
accumulating ill-gotten wealth during his incumbency as president
of the Philippines from 1965 onward," Mrs. Marcos said in her
counterclaim.
</P>
<P>
"All enterprises, companies, properties and/or interests
acquired, owned and possessed by President Marcos do not
constitute ill-gotten wealth," she said.

<HEADLINE> China to Expand Unemployment Benefits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 15 (Xinhua) -- China's expanding unemployment
insurance network is expected to cover all the country's 140
million urban employees by June, suggests Ren Zemin, director of
the Ministry of Labor and Social Security's Legal Department.
</P>
<P>
A newly released Regulation on Unemployment Insurance is
expected to encourage a free flow of talent and labor and help
with the reform of State-owned enterprises, today's China's Daily
quoted Ren as saying.
</P>
<P>
The regulation requires urban enterprises and institutions and
their employees to co-establish an unemployment insurance fund,
which also will receive State funding.
</P>
<P>
Enterprises are required to pay 2 percent of their employees'
salaries, while the employees should contribute 1 percent of their
wages to the fund, according to the new regulation.
</P>
<P>
Created in 1986, the unemployment insurance system now covers
79.6 million people, 85.4 percent of whom are working for State
firms, said Mao Jian, director of the ministry's Employment
Department.
</P>
<P>
The country's unemployment rate is unlikely to drop in the
coming few years because the State sector will shed redundant
labors, Ren said.
</P>
<P>
China's registered urban unemployment rate is 3.1 percent. The
figure does not include the 6.09 million laid-off workers who are
being taken care of by re-employment centers set up within their
original enterprises.
</P>
<P>
These centers were introduced earlier as a three-year
transitional shelter for laid-off workers, as China has not had a
sound social insurance system until now, said Mo Rong, associate
professor of the Institute for Labor Studies.
</P>
<P>
The centers pay the laid-off workers a monthly subsidy ranging
form 140 yuan to 380 yuan. The disbursement is paid by the
government, the unemployment insurance fund and enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Since the government plans to complete the reform of State-
owned enterprises by 2000, these enterprise-based re-employment
centers are expected to disappear by the end of 2003, Mo said.
</P>
<P>
Laid-off workers who fail to find a job by that time will get
payments form the unemployment insurance fund for a maximum of two
years, Mo said.

<HEADLINE> Manila Starts Legal Battle to Recover Marcoses' Wealth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 15 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government starts
Monday the all-out legal battle with the Marcoses to fulfill the
conditions of the Swiss Federal Supreme Court for the release of
the remaining 440 million U.S. dollars of the recovered 590
million dollar Marcos Swiss deposits.
</P>
<P>
The government is seeking a final and favorable judgment on
Forfeiture Case 0140, which seeks to recover the entire alleged
ill-gotten wealth of the Marcoses and their cronies.
</P>
<P>
The Supreme Court has set the pretrial hearing of the
eight-year-old case today based on a petition filed last month by
the Presidential Commission on Good Government(PCGG).
</P>
<P>
If it wins the case, not only can the Philippine government get
hold of the 440-million Marcos Swiss deposits, but it can also
recover assets and properties of the Marcoses that have reached an
estimated 5 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Armed with evidence proving that the Marcos assets and
properties are ill-gotten and should be returned to the
government, PCGG Chairman Magdangal Elma said he is confident that
the government will win.
</P>
<P>
The Swiss Federal Supreme Court, in its rulings in December
1997 and January 1998, ordered the remittance of the 540-million
dollar(now 590 million dollar) Marcos Swiss deposits to the
government and placed it in an escrow account at the Philippine
National Bank (PNB) pending compliance to two conditions.
</P>
<P>
The first condition is the final judgment on Forfeiture Case
0141. The second is fair sharing with the 10,000 victims of
martial law who obtained a 2.35-billion dollar judgment against
the Marcos estate.
</P>
<P>
The government, through an undertaking signed by the PCGG with
PNB officials and lawyers of Marcos foundations, has agreed to
release the 150-million dollar settlement reached by the Marcoses
and the martial-law victims from the escrow account. This fulfills
the second condition set by the Swiss court.
</P>
<P>
The remaining 440 million dollars will be remitted the nation's
coffers if the government can prove that the deposits are
ill-gotten.
</P>
<P>
The case was originally filed by the Solicitor General
Francisco Chavez on December 17, 1991, to recover from the
Marcoses the Swiss accounts as well as assets and properties
totaling 5 billion dollars.

<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, March 14 (Xinhua) -- The Pakistani government has
welcomed the agreement reached Sunday in the second round of talks
in Turkmenistan's capital of Ashgabat between the Afghan Taliban
and the opposition Northern Alliance.
</P>
<P>
"We will lend our full support to its satisfactory
culmination," a Foreign Office spokesman said in a statement
Sunday evening.
</P>
<P>
He said Pakistan had played behind-the-scene role to promote
the talks between the Afghan warring factions.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan remained in touch with the Taliban leadership in
Kandahar to persuade them to send a delegation for talks to the
Turkmenistan capital, the spokesman noted.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, he said Foreign Minister Sartaj Aziz had two-hour
talks in Islamabad on March 7 with the Taliban's top negotiator
Wakil Ahmed Motawakkil regarding the Ashgabat talks.
</P>
<P>
Motawakkil, a close aide of the Taliban's Supreme Commander
Mullah Muhammad Omar, led his side at the three-day talk in
Ashgabat with Muhammad Younas Qanouni, political advisor of main
opposition commander Ahmed Shah Masood, and his team.
</P>
<P>
The representatives of the Afghan factions made a major
breakthrough in their talks Sunday, agreeing to form a shared
executive, a shared legislature and a shared judiciary.
</P>
<P>
The two sides decided to continue their peace talks in order to
address the rest of the issues and to implement the decisions
already reached. The next round of talks is scheduled to be held
inside Afghanistan at a mutually-agreed venue as soon as
practicable.
</P>
<P>
They also agreed to release 20 prisoners each as soon as
possible through the International Committee of the Red Cross.

LONDON, March 14 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony Blair
and U.S. President Bill Clinton Sunday discussed the situation in
Northern Ireland by telephone, British officials said.

<P>
The talks came ahead of Clinton's meetings this week with the
leaders in Northern Ireland, which are scheduled to be held at St.
Patrick's Day celebrations in Washington.

British government officials hope that Clinton can help to end
a row over Irish Republican Army guns that is blocking progress on
Northern Ireland's peace pact.

"The prime minister gave his assessment of the situation in
advance of the president's meetings this week in Washington with
some of the key players," a Downing Street spokesman told

"The prime minister said the president could have a real
influence. President Clinton, as ever, said he would do what he
could," he said.

Ireland and the United States worked together closely in this

East peace process during their 20-minute conversation, he said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Planes Again Attack Positions in Northern Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, March 14 (Xinhua) -- U.S. combat planes Sunday again
attacked military positions in northern Iraq and west of Mosul,
according to U.S. military officials in the German town of
Stuttgart.
</P>
<P>
The pilots had noticed Iraq flak fire and had acted "in
self-defense," the U.S. command in Stuttgart said. It said the
planes, using laser-guided bombs, attacked artillery and radar
installations.
</P>
<P>
An Iraqi military spokesman said that the U.S. air activity
over northern Iraq lasted for two hours between 0900 GMT and 1100
GMT and involved strikes on "service installations and air defense
positions," according to reports of the German Press Agency.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said the raiding planes were "engaged" by Iraqi
positions and eventually "forced to flee back to their bases in
Turkey" after undertaking 22 sorties over Dhok, Irbil and Mosul.
</P>
<P>
At 1245 GMT, U.S. aircraft backed by British Tornado planes
undertook 76 forays in southern Iraq over a period of 45 minutes
and were engaged by air defense including ground-to-air missile
positions, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
He also said that the planes which flew in from bases in Saudi
Arabia and Kuwait bombed "service installations and air defense
positions" in al Muthanna governorate.
</P>
<P>
On Friday. U.S. combat planes also attacked Iraqi military
positions in northern Iraq in "self-defense" after they were
detected by Iraqi radar, U.S. air force officials said. Neither
Iraq nor the U.S. have given any accounts or estimates of damage
or casualties.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Prison Population Doubles Over Past 12 Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 14 (Xinhua) -- The number of U.S. adults
imprisoned has more than doubled over the past 12 years, reaching
its highest level ever last year, the Justice Department said
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
At mid-1998, jails and prisons held an estimated 1.8 million
people, according to a Bureau of Justice Statistics report. At the
end of 1985, the figure was 744,208.
</P>
<P>
Viewed another way, there were 668 inmates for every 100,000
U.S. residents as of June 1998, compared with 313 inmates per
100,000 people in 1985.
</P>
<P>
The number of people imprisoned in the United States has grown
for more than a quarter century, helped by increased drug
prosecutions and a general get-tough policy on all classes of
offenders.
</P>
<P>
More criminals serving longer sentences led the inmate
population to top 1 million in 1990.
</P>
<P>
About two-thirds of the nation's inmates are in state and
federal prisons; the remaining one-third are in local jails.
</P>
<P>
In the June 1998 Justice Department survey, 1.2 million people
were held in prisons, while local jails held about 600,000 men and
women. Local jails also supervised more than 72,000 people under
various outside work, treatment or home detention programs.
</P>
<P>
The survey showed the total number of people behind bars grew
by 4.4 percent from June 1997.
</P>
<P>
Between the end of 1990 and mid-1998, the incarcerated
population grew an average 6.2 percent annually, said the report's
author, statistician Darrell Gilliard.

<HEADLINE> Serb Delegate: NATO Cannot Be in Kosovo Unless Invited </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, March 14 (Xinhua) -- The chief delegate of the Serbian
delegation to the talks on Kosovo, Ratko Markovic, said Sunday in
Paris that Belgrade was opposed to the deployment of a
multinational force in Kosovo without an invitation.
</P>
<P>
"If NATO comes to Serbia without invitation, it will be
considered a kind of invader and enemy. Yugoslavia has the
legitimate right of defense," he said at a press conference.
</P>
<P>
He said that foreign troops could not come to Kosovo unless
Serbia does not have sovereignty over the province.
</P>
<P>
"Since we are a sovereign state, that cannot be done except
with an invitation," he said.
</P>
<P>
Markovic, who is vice prime minister of the Serbian Republic,
said that a presence of foreign force would mean that Kosovo was
an independent state and that Belgrade would lose all political
control over the province if it allowed that.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that Yugoslavia would make a distinction between
political agreement and occupation.
</P>
<P>
The Serbian delegation arrived in Paris Sunday to participate
in the new conference on Kosovo which will start Monday.
