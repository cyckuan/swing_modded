<HEADLINE> McLachlan Says Woodstock About Money </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Lilith Fair founder Sarah McLachlan knows what  
went wrong at Woodstock. 
</P>
<P>
	``When Woodstock was conceived, it was a beautiful thing,''  
McLachlan says in Sunday's New York Post. ``But what happened is it 
turned into this big, horrible commercial madness. It became all 
about making money.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Riots closed out the Woodstock concert festival this year, with  
fans burning and looting the stocks of vendors who sold water for 
as much as $4 a bottle. Things are different at Lilith Fair, the 
mostly female concert tour McLachlan founded three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	```Concerts with a conscience -- I like that,'' McLachlan said.  
``We've worked hard to create an environment for the artists and 
audience that is friendly, safe and socially conscious. We give 
room to all the nonprofit organizations that we support. 
</P>
<P>
	This is the last year for Lilith Fair. McLachlan says she and  
its other female performer want more free time so they can begin 
starting families.

<HEADLINE> Forest Service Remembers 1949 Blaze </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HELENA, Mont. (AP) -- Late on the bone-dry August afternoon, the  
air shimmering with 97-degree heat, 15 smokejumpers parachuted into 
a remote gulch to fight a fire sparked by lightning. 
</P>
<P>
	Within 90 minutes, 10 were dead, overtaken by a searing wall of  
flame 200 feet high. A forest ranger on the ground died with them. 
Two others succumbed to burns the next day. 
</P>
<P>
	This Thursday, the U.S. Forest Service marks the 50th  
anniversary of the 1949 Mann Gulch fire -- the first major 
catastrophe to befall the agency's then-fledgling smokejumper 
program. 
</P>
<P>
	The number of firefighter deaths in a single blaze, 13, was  
unsurpassed until July 6, 1994, when an inferno on Storm King 
mountain outside Glenwood Springs, Colo., killed 14 firefighters, 
three of them smokejumpers. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mann Gulch tragedy inspired a 1952 Hollywood movie, ``Red  
Skies of Montana,'' and was the subject of the haunting, 1992 
nonfiction bestseller ``Young Men and Fire'' by Norman Maclean, who 
also wrote ``A River Runs Through It.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this year, Mann Gulch joined the National Register of  
Historic Sites. Granite markers on the hillside commemorate the men 
who died. 
</P>
<P>
	Like the 10 men and four women killed on Storm King, the Mann  
Gulch firefighters died when a fire blew up and trapped them on a 
steep slope. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Mann Gulch fire was very significant for us. It was really  
the start of the Forest Service's commitment to understanding fire 
behavior, and the commitment to firefighters' safety,'' says Jerry 
Williams, fire coordinator at the regional Forest Service 
headquarters in Missoula. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's where we started developing protective equipment for  
people, better tools ... also kind of a national mobilization 
toward establishing fire line safe practices,'' Williams says. 
</P>
<P>
	On Aug. 5, 1949, the Forest Service crew completed their jump  
into Mann Gulch between 3:50 and 4:10 p.m. and were joined on the 
ground by forest ranger Jim Harrison, who had been alone on the 
scene for hours digging fire lines. 
</P>
<P>
	The single radio that was dropped from the airplane with them  
smashed on impact, cutting off the crew from outside communication. 
</P>
<P>
	The men were heading down the gulch toward the Missouri River  
when flames flared up below them and jumped across the ravine. 
</P>
<P>
	The men quickly realized their predicament. Flames were racing  
up the steep slope toward them. The only escape was over the ridge. 
They dropped their gear and ran. 
</P>
<P>
	The fire overtook them one by one. Eleven died in the gulch,  
where temperatures probably reached 1,800 degrees, according to 
estimates possible today. Two more died in a Helena hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	Only three smokejumpers survived -- foreman R. Wagner ``Wag''  
Dodge, at 33 the oldest member of the group, who lit a back fire 
and lay down in the burned-out area as the main fire skipped over 
or around him, and two teen-agers, Robert Sallee and Walter Rumsey, 
who found refuge in the rim rocks high above the slope. 
</P>
<P>
	Eventually, it took 450 firefighters to control the blaze, which  
grew from 60 acres to 3,000. 
</P>
<P>
	The confusion and lack of communication at Mann Gulch prompted  
significant changes in smokejumper training, says Laird Robinson, a 
former smokejumper and veteran Forest Service official in Missoula, 
who helped Maclean with research for ``Young Men and Fire.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wag Dodge, for instance, while an experienced smokejumper and  
foreman, was a stranger to most of his crew that day, Robinson 
says. Now, smokejumpers undergo a paramilitary regimen in which 
veterans help train the crews they will lead into fires. 
</P>
<P>
	Mann Gulch and other killer wildfires also prompted  
establishment of fire science laboratories, at Missoula and at 
Macon, Ga., where the Forest Service studies how fires behave, how 
weather affects them and how best to fight them in various 
conditions. 
</P>
<P>
	Development labs in Missoula and San Dimas, Calif., invented or  
improved much of the equipment today's firefighters use in the 
wild. 
</P>
<P>
	``In 1949 they wore jeans and a cotton, long-sleeved work shirt.  
They wore baseball hats,'' Robinson says. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, smokejumpers wear hardhats and fire-resistant clothing.  
Several members in a crew carry compact, multi-channel radios that 
keep them in contact with dispatchers, aircraft and other crews. 
</P>
<P>
	And every smokejumper carries a fire shelter, Robinson says,  
``basically a tiny aluminum tent that one individual can crawl 
inside of, that's heat reflective.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The center of attention at this week's commemoration in Helena  
is likely to be Bob Sallee, the last living survivor of the Mann 
Gulch fire. Sallee, 67, an engineer and paper manufacturing 
executive from Spokane, Wash., does not relish the limelight. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm participating in it because I don't really have any  
choice,'' Sallee says. ``I'm the only survivor. I have a lot of 
smokejumper friends who are telling me that, like it or not, I'm 
part of history and I have to go up there and do this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Also attending will be Jack Harrison, who 50 years ago was  
summoned to identify the body of his brother, the ranger who died 
in the fire. 
</P>
<P>
	``My brother had been a smokejumper the year before, and my  
mother didn't want him to jump anymore because it was too 
dangerous,'' Harrison says. So Jim Harrison took a job as 
recreation ranger at a nearby Forest Service picnic area -- and died 
at Mann Gulch. 
</P>
<P>
	``My mother never did really get over it,'' Jack Harrison says.  
</P>
<P>
	``I think the Forest Service has done a good job,'' he adds. ``I  
think if my brother were here today, he'd be proud of what they're 
doing. ... I was thinking, 'Boy, if Jimmy was down here he'd be 
grinning from ear to ear.'''

<HEADLINE> Colombian Rebel Army Kills 17 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) -- Hundreds of guerrillas from the nation's  
largest rebel army launched a three-day attack on a police station, 
killing at least 17 people, including nine police officers and four 
children, police said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Eight other police officers were wounded and seven more taken  
prisoner in the weekend attack by the Revolutionary Armed Forces of 
Colombia, or FARC. 
</P>
<P>
	The attack, which ended Sunday, was one of the most deadly  
guerrilla assaults on civilians in memory. 
</P>
<P>
	``I haven't words for what I'm seeing, the horror,'' state  
police commander Ruben Carillo told The Associated Press by 
telephone from Narino, a town of 4,000 residents located 100 miles 
northwest of Bogota. 
</P>
<P>
	Police and soldiers arrived at noon Sunday in the sugar and  
coffee producing town, where 300 rebels attacked a police station 
defended by 35 officers. 
</P>
<P>
	Carillo said the rebel barrage destroyed 30 homes, the mayor's  
office, a bank and a school. The civilians killed included four 
adults and four children. 
</P>
<P>
	The police officers who weren't killed or taken prisoner by the  
FARC escaped unhurt or with minor injuries, Carillo said. 
</P>
<P>
	Television images showed the smoking ruins of houses in a  
two-block radius surrounding the flattened police barracks. The 
buildings were reduced to rubble by powerful, but inaccurate 
attacks with missiles fashioned from natural gas canisters. 
</P>
<P>
	Though FARC has been in peace negotiations with President Andres  
Pastrana's government since January, there is no cease-fire in 
effect. 
</P>
<P>
	The rebels hold more than 450 police and soldiers from earlier  
attacks on similar outposts, hoping to use them to boost their 
position in talks to end the country's 35-year conflict.

<HEADLINE> Britain Wants To Investigate Mars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Britain wants to send a space probe to Mars in  
2003 to investigate whether there is life on the red planet, the 
government said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The spacecraft will be named Beagle Two -- after the ship that  
carried Charles Darwin on his 1830s voyage that shaped his theory 
of evolution. It will be emblazoned with the Union Jack. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokesman from the Department of Trade and Industry said the  
probe would be launched from the European Space Agency's Mars 
Express satellite, due to take off in 2003. 
</P>
<P>
	``Beagle Two is a probe that will detach itself from the  
satellite and go down to the surface of Mars, where its purpose is 
to examine the elements present to see if life could have existed, 
did exist or could appear in the future,'' the government spokesman 
said, speaking with customary anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1996, a team of scientists in America caused an uproar with  
their announcement that a meteorite from Mars showed evidence of 
ancient microfossil life. Since then, researchers have raised 
serious doubt about the conclusions that primitive biological life 
existed on Mars 4 billion years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Independent analyses have failed to yield absolute evidence that  
the potato-sized chunk of rock, found in Antarctica in 1984, ever 
contained life. 
</P>
<P>
	The British project, which is expected to cost $40 million, was  
to be announced by Science Minister Lord Sainsbury this week, The 
Sunday Times reported. The London-based newspaper said much of the 
money had already been raised by universities and industry. The 
government was expected to meet any shortfall, The Times said.

<HEADLINE> Insurance Cos. Merge in $1.2B Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Real estate services company Fidelity National  
Financial Inc. has agreed to buy larger rival Chicago Title Corp. 
for about $1.2 billion, or $52 a share, in about equal amounts of 
cash and stock. 
</P>
<P>
	The purchase, announced Sunday, more than doubles the size of  
Fidelity National Financial to about 1,000 offices throughout the 
country. The combined company will retain the name Fidelity 
National Financial, but will be run separately, First National said 
in a news release. 
</P>
<P>
	Based on 1998 combined revenue of about $3.2 billion, Fidelity  
National said the combined company will be the largest title 
insurance company in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	The $52 a share offer represents a 42 percent premium over  
Chicago Title's closing price Thursday, the day before talks 
between the two companies were announced. 
</P>
<P>
	The cash and stock balance will be adjusted so Chicago Title  
stockholders will receive more than 50 percent of the outstanding 
stock of the new company, Fidelity National said. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal, is expected to be completed by the end of March, will  
help Fidelity National, the nation's No. 5 title insurance company, 
expand its commercial insurance business. 
</P>
<P>
	Chicago Title, the nation's No. 3 title insurer, is a holding  
company for a group of insurance companies that provide title 
insurance, property valuation and other services for real estate 
transactions involving financial institutions, insurers and 
companies buying commerical properties. The group writes about 
one-fifth of all title insurance policies in the U.S. 
</P>
<P>
	``The addition of Chicago Title's operations, products and  
skills ... will result in the creation of a preeminent competitor 
in the title insurance industry,'' William P. Foley II, Fidelity's 
chairman and chief executive officer, said in a news release. 
</P>
<P>
	``The new company will also be a premier player in the rapidly  
growing area for real estate information services, accommodating 
customers that may desire 'one-stop-shopping' for all of their 
service needs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of Fidelity National closed Friday at $17.43 3/4, down 6 1/4  
cents, on the New York Stock Exchange. Chicago Title's shares were 
up 16.5 percent, or $6.06 1/4, at $42.75, also on the Big Board. 
</P>
<P>
	Fidelity National said the acquisition would add to its earnings  
per share by a ``high single digit to low double digit'' amount 
during the first year. 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement, which has been approved by the boards of both  
companies, is subject to approval by both companies shareholders.

<HEADLINE> First Lady Explains Husband's Lies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- First lady Hillary Rodham Clinton, in a magazine  
interview about her marriage, blames her husband's infidelity on a 
desire to please women that can be traced back to his childhood, 
according to The Sunday Times. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was so young, barely four, when he was scarred by abuse.  
There was a terrible conflict between his mother and grandmother,'' 
Mrs. Clinton told ``Talk'' magazine, according to the London-based 
newspaper, which said it obtained a copy of the interview. 
</P>
<P>
	``A psychologist once told me that for a boy being in the middle  
of a conflict between two women is the worst possible situation,'' 
Mrs. Clinton was quoted as saying. ``There is always a desire to 
please each one.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The magazine, edited by former New Yorker editor Tina Brown,  
debuts at newsstands Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton was impeached by the House of Representatives for lying  
about his affair with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky; 
the Senate acquitted him after a trial in February. 
</P>
<P>
	``He couldn't protect me, so he lied,'' Mrs. Clinton was quoted  
in the newspaper as saying. 
</P>
<P>
	In Washington, White House spokesman Jake Siewert would not  
comment on Mrs. Clinton's statements in the article. 
</P>
<P>
	``The article paints a portrait of Mrs. Clinton that is quite  
positive and it speaks for itself,'' he said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sunday Times said that Mrs. Clinton emphasized in the  
``Talk'' interview that her husband's affair with Ms. Lewinsky 
occurred after the deaths of his mother, her father and the 1993 
suicide of their close friend Vincent Foster. 
</P>
<P>
	``You know in Christian theology there are sins of weakness and  
sins of malice, and this was a sin of weakness,'' Mrs. Clinton was 
quoted as saying. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton said she thought her husband's infidelity ``was  
resolved ten years ago. ... I thought he had conquered it,'' 
according to the newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
	But she said that since the scandal, her husband ``has been  
working on himself very hard. ... He has become more aware of his 
past and what was causing this behavior.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She defended him as ``a, very, very good man,'' but said, ``Yes,  
he has weaknesses, yes he needs to be more responsible, more 
disciplined.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton also refuted suggestions that she stuck with the  
president for her own benefit, rather than out of love, The Sunday 
Times reported. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everyone has some dysfunction in their families. They have to  
deal with it. You don't walk away if you love someone. You help the 
person,'' she is quoted as saying. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton was asked by the ``Talk'' interviewer: ``And it is  
love, isn't it?'' 
</P>
<P>
	According to the London-based newspaper, she replied, ``Yes, it  
is. We have love.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton acknowledged the pain of the infidelities, but said  
it did not outweigh the close relationship the couple have built up 
throughout their marriage. 
</P>
<P>
	``Is he ashamed? Yes. Is he sorry? Yes. But does this negate  
everything he has done as a husband, a father, a president?,'' Mrs. 
Clinton asked. ``There has been enormous pain, enormous anger, but 
I have been with him half my life and he is a very, very good man. 
We just have a deep connection that transcends whatever happens.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And despite the very public scandals, Mrs. Clinton said the  
couple remain close. 
</P>
<P>
	``We talk. We talk in the solarium, in the bedroom, in the  
kitchen -- it's just constant conversation,'' she was quoted as 
saying. ``We like to lie in bed and watch old movies, you know, 
those little individual video machines you can hold on your lap.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton also talked about her move toward a run for a U.S.  
Senate seat from New York. ``Now for the first time I am making my 
own decisions. I can feel the difference. It is a great relief,'' 
she said, according to a news release from the magazine.

<HEADLINE> Gun Control Advocates Regroup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Last spring's Colorado school massacre gave gun  
control advocates much to further their agenda. They had a villain: 
the TEC-DC-9, a banned, cheap semiautomatic pistol favored by drug 
dealers. They had a regulatory problem: lax sales rules at gun 
shows. 
</P>
<P>
	But Mark O. Barton's shooting spree last week in Atlanta, which  
took nine lives, is another story. 
</P>
<P>
	Half the nation's police officers carry the 9 mm Glock-19  
semiautomatic pistol assembled a dozen miles from the brokerage 
firms where Barton killed six of his victims. His other weapon, a 
Colt .45 pistol, is the gun Tom Hanks aims at a tank in the final 
scene of ``Saving Private Ryan'' and the gun Sgt. Alvin C. York 
used to single-handedly capture 132 Germans during World War I. 
</P>
<P>
	While the Atlanta killings have energized gun control advocates,  
they provide few clear examples of the narrow issues gun control 
advocates have recently pursued. 
</P>
<P>
	Child safety locks wouldn't have deterred Barton. Police had no  
evidence he got his guns illegally, or bought them at a gun show 
where sales rules are lax. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest slayings strip the debate to the most basic question  
-- should handguns be banned entirely, said Josh Sugarman, executive 
director of the Washington-based Violence Policy Center. 
</P>
<P>
	``Until we start talking about banning handguns in this country,  
this is America's future. We'll have shootings in schools, in 
office buildings, in malls,'' Sugarman said. ``In America, wherever 
you're amid a large concentration of people, you're at risk.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, a group of Colorado students stood at the site of the  
May massacre at Columbine High School to renew their call for 
stronger curbs on handgun ownership. 
</P>
<P>
	Atlanta and Columbine ``taught us all that violence can happen  
everywhere, not just in the inner city, not just by hardened 
criminals,'' said Ben Gelt, a recent Denver high school graduate 
who organized student gun control advocates following the Littleton 
shootings. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokesman for the National Rifle Association, Bill Powers,  
criticized efforts to ``score political points off of a tragedy'' 
and said he doesn't expect the Atlanta shootings to lead to 
significant changes in gun law. 
</P>
<P>
	``If they want to come out and debate a total handgun ban in  
America, that's a debate they'll lose with the American people,'' 
Powers said. 
</P>
<P>
	Glock Inc. and Colt's Manufacturing Company Inc. are among the  
dozens of gun makers named in lawsuits filed by Atlanta, 15 other 
cities and three counties since November. The suits allege the gun 
makers recklessly or unfairly put guns in the hands of criminals. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet unlike the low-cost, high-powered assault weapons used in  
Littleton and elsewhere, the guns used in Atlanta have drawn 
comparatively little criticism. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you believe the manufacture and sale of guns is at all  
legitimate, certainly the Colt .45 and the Glock would meet the 
description of acceptable weapons,'' conceded Naomi Paiss, a 
spokeswoman for Handgun Control Inc., a Washington group that 
lobbies for gun control. 
</P>
<P>
	The Colt .45 was used by the U.S. military from 1911 until the  
1980s, when it was phased out in favor of a Beretta. Police 
officers like the Austrian-designed Glock 9 mm for its reliability, 
ease of maintenance and light weight. 
</P>
<P>
	Both sell for $500 to $550, although custom models can cost  
more. 
</P>
<P>
	The Glock drew unwanted attention in the film ``Die Hard 2''  
when Bruce Willis' character mistakenly said the gun was 
undetectable to metal detectors because it's made entirely of 
plastic. The barrel and other parts actually are metal, notes Bob 
Glass, a gun enthusiast and publisher of the magazine The Partisan 
who has run a Glock through a metal detector. 
</P>
<P>
	``Believe me, it showed up clear as day,'' Glass said.  
</P>
<P>
	Police said a duffel bag in Barton's van also contained a  
.25-caliber Raven semiautomatic pistol and a .22-caliber Harrington 
&AMP; Richardson revolver, both of which he apparently bought legally 
in pawn shops. They weren't used in the killings. 
</P>
<P>
	The Atlanta shootings have drawn attention to two narrow  
gun-control issues: gun sales to people with psychological 
problems, and large-capacity ammunition clips. 
</P>
<P>
	The Glock can hold 16 bullets. The federal Brady bill of 1994  
banned the manufacture of clips holding more than 10 bullets, but 
allowed those already on the market to be owned and resold. 
Congress has shown little interest in broadening the ban. 
</P>
<P>
	Paiss, of Handgun Control, questioned whether psychological  
traits should bar some from owning guns. 
</P>
<P>
	Glock lawyer Paul Jannuzzo said he'd support psychological  
restrictions if there was a way of doing it. But privacy advocates 
would likely oppose opening medical records to gun vendors. 
</P>
<P>
	And there's little evidence a psychologically based ban would  
have affected Barton. Douglas County District Attorney David McDade 
recalled that a psychologist who once examined Barton after a child 
abuse complaint considered him capable of homicide. 
</P>
<P>
	However, in his written report on Barton, the psychologist  
dismissed the possibility of sexual abuse and didn't mention his 
suspicions about Barton's propensity for violence, McDade and child 
welfare officials said.

<HEADLINE> Baseball Probing Montague Letter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Baseball officials are investigating a letter  
sent by an umpire's wife to determine if it warrants disciplinary 
action against her husband. 
</P>
<P>
	AL umpire John Hirschbeck, whose wife received the letter, said  
Sunday he had reported the matter to baseball. A top baseball 
official, speaking on condition he not be identified, said the 
sport could take action against NL umpire Ed Montague, whose wife 
sent the letter. 
</P>
<P>
	Hirschbeck, one of the umpires who has organized opposition to  
union head Richie Phillips, said Sunday he didn't want to comment 
further. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the union leadership prepared to file unfair labor  
practice charges against owners, possibly as soon as Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Baseball's league presidents sent umpires a memo last week  
warning them against ``illegal threats, intimidation or harassment 
of other umpires who may have a different point of view.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Marcia Montague, whose husband supports Phillips, sent an angry  
letter to Denise Hirschbeck. Phillips thought it eloquently 
outlined the union's position -- so much that he cried. Umpires 
opposing the union leadership thought it was harassment. 
</P>
<P>
	Marcia Montague accused John Hirschbeck of ``undermining 20  
years of work from an association that has reaped him so many 
benefits.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Phillips and union president Jerry Crawford announced a mass  
resignation plan on July 14, thinking it would force baseball to 
immediately negotiate a deal to replace the labor contract that 
expires Dec. 31. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, the move backfired because 13 umpires didn't resign and  
14 quickly withdrew their resignations, which were to take effect 
Sept. 2. Baseball then hired 25 new umps from the minors and 
accepted the resignations of 22 umps. 
</P>
<P>
	Phillips' supporters blame John Hirschbeck and fellow AL ump Joe  
Brinkman for organizing the opposition. Marcia Montague blamed 
Hirschbeck for going ``behind people's backs'' and called him a 
``traitor and a coward.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a shame because it would have been a good fight against  
what's wrong in baseball,'' Marcia Montague wrote. ``Maybe we all 
could have made a difference in the fight to restore real 
leadership to the game. I would have liked to see us take on the 
MLB, the commissioner and the media. For promoting the myths that 
umpires are arrogant, when they are actually proud; that they are 
not accountable, when they always have been, to the leagues and to 
themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	``But we didn't see the Judas in our midst, who sold us out for  
20 pieces of gold. I guess you'll have to live with that. And John, 
every time he walks out on that field. And your kids, when you 
teach them about ethics and morals. And all the other umpires and 
their wives and children who followed John because they believed in 
... what? ... 
</P>
<P>
	``John is an embarrassment to all real umpires and baseball  
because he forgot the quintessential -- baseball is a team sport, 
and he thinks he is bigger than the team. He shamed us all. I can 
say my husband was good for the game -- can you?''

<HEADLINE> Bears Resume Talks With McNown </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- The Chicago Bears and holdout rookie quarterback  
Cade McNown resumed contract talks Sunday, with the two sides 
exchanging proposals. 
</P>
<P>
	McNown and his agent, Tom Condon, will fly to Chicago on Monday  
to meet with Bears negotiator Jim Miller, the team said in a news 
release. 
</P>
<P>
	``The status of the negotiations has not changed, we'll just  
continue our discussions in person,'' Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
	There are concerns that unless the former UCLA star gets to  
training camp soon, he will be too far behind to learn the Bears' 
new offensive system and won't be able to start the season opener. 
</P>
<P>
	McNown, the 12th pick overall, was practically given the No. 1  
quarterback job when the team released Erik Kramer just before 
training camp opened 10 days ago.

<HEADLINE> Ant Colony on Verge of Extinction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ISHIKARI, Japan (AP) -- A man in a tweed blazer and a white sun  
hat walks slowly through a patch of sea grass on the coast of 
northern Japan, searching. 
</P>
<P>
	A truck rumbles down the highway toward a cluster of cranes in  
the distance, but he doesn't look up. He bends down when he finds 
what he was looking for, a small hole in a pile of sand -- the 
entryway to the largest colony of ants ever found on earth. 
</P>
<P>
	For Prof. Seigo Higashi, this is not just an anthill, it's a  
life's work. For 28 years, he has studied, counted and even lived 
among the hundreds of millions of Japanese red wood ants that dwell 
on this strip of shoreline. 
</P>
<P>
	Higashi has observed every facet of their lifecycle, from their  
eating habits to their mating rituals. Now 50, he began studying 
the ant colony as a graduate student in his early 20s. Today, he is 
watching their ancient empire die. 
</P>
<P>
	``There used to be a whole lot of these,'' he said, kneeling to  
pick up one of the orange-brown bugs between his thumb and 
forefinger. ``Now, so many have disappeared.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the early 1970s, Higashi was part of a Hokkaido University  
team that made a startling discovery. 
</P>
<P>
	Studying ants on the coastal grasslands of Japan's northern  
island of Hokkaido, they found a cluster of nests linked in a large 
network, a supercolony. 
</P>
<P>
	At the time of its discovery, the Hokkaido colony included an  
estimated 45,000 nests and stretched nearly 12.4 miles along the 
shore of the Japan Sea. 
</P>
<P>
	The complex housed an estimated 307 million Japanese red wood  
ants, including some 306 million workers and about 1.1 million 
queens. 
</P>
<P>
	The scale was -- and still is -- unprecedented.  
</P>
<P>
	``As a species, this ant isn't rare or particularly unusual,''  
said Higashi, who took the first headcount here in 1971. ``As a 
supercolony, though, it's really something.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There are only two known ant supercolonies in the world. The  
other, smaller one is in the Swiss Jura mountains. 
</P>
<P>
	A typical ant colony is comprised mostly of one or more  
egg-laying queens and infertile females, or workers, who tend the 
young, expand the nest and defend the colony. For a short period 
once a year, the colony produces males and fertile females. These 
ants leave the nest in a ``nuptial flight'' to mate and start new 
colonies. 
</P>
<P>
	Generally, individuals from different nests will fight each  
other to the death, even if they're the same kind of ant. 
</P>
<P>
	But for reasons scientists don't fully understand, the ants here  
and in Switzerland -- both of the Formica genus -- have been able to 
build supercolonies connected by trails or tunnels through which 
workers can travel freely. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hokkaido supercolony is populated by a relatively common  
species, the Japanese red wood ant. It can be found in Japan, 
Siberia, China, Taiwan and the Korean Peninsula. 
</P>
<P>
	But only in Hokkaido is it known to have constructed a  
supercolony. 
</P>
<P>
	Higashi said he thinks the colony could have been started as  
long as 1,000 years ago near the mouth of the Ishikari River, about 
nine miles north of Sapporo, Hokkaido's largest city. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the colony wasn't discovered until this century, Higashi  
said, scientists aren't 100 percent certain of its age. 
</P>
<P>
	There is one thing he does know: It takes a lot longer to build  
a supercolony than to destroy one. 
</P>
<P>
	Construction of the new port on Ishikari Bay began in 1973. Port  
facilities were constructed, roads were built, warehouses, cement 
silos and industrial-sized freezers were installed -- all on top of 
the ant megalopolis. 
</P>
<P>
	Within a decade, the development project covered about 30  
percent of the area formerly occupied by the supercolony. Today, 
Higashi estimates, it has reduced the number of ants living there 
by more than half. 
</P>
<P>
	``If only we'd found the supercolony sooner,'' he said. ``Maybe  
then we could have done something to save it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Japanese wood ant defends itself easily. Touch the outside  
of one of their mounds, and ants will rush up your arm and deliver 
a smarting bite. 
</P>
<P>
	But it is extremely sensitive to change. Vibrations caused by  
jackhammers and trucks can easily wipe out entire nests. Roads, 
waterways and buildings can restrict the ants' ability to move 
between the nests of the colony. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the Hokkaido government and authorities in Tokyo say  
protecting the colony is not of particular concern. 
</P>
<P>
	``This species of ant is not seen as endangered,'' said Takanori  
Higuchi, a spokesman for the Environment Agency in Tokyo. ``There's 
nothing we can do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So the construction continues.  
</P>
<P>
	Higashi rarely gets out to see his ants anymore.  
</P>
<P>
	He has taken up studying several other types of ants and has  
left the research on the supercolony to his graduate students. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a pity,'' said Daniel Cherix, a professor at the  
University of Lausanne in Switzerland who has studied both the 
Swiss and the Japanese supercolonies. 
</P>
<P>
	In much of Europe, Cherix said, the Formica ant nests are  
protected. But he admitted that when economics is a factor, 
protection ``is really kind of hard.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Higashi, however, thinks the real problem is that ants are ants.  
Why would anyone want to protect bugs? 
</P>
<P>
	No one in these parts has ever made much of a fuss about what  
some might claim as a major landmark, he notes. Local papers have 
occasionally taken up the issue of protecting the colony, but most 
residents just aren't interested. 
</P>
<P>
	And outside of the immediate area, few people -- including  
officials at the Environment Agency -- have even heard of it. 
</P>
<P>
	``People just don't care,'' he said. ``If this were bears or  
something like that, maybe they would.'' 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	-- Ants have been living on the Earth for at least 100 million  
years and can be found almost anywhere on the planet. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Scientists say that about 15 percent of the Earth's total  
biomass -- the combined weight of all living things -- is composed of 
ants. Another 17 percent is taken up by termites. The combined 
weight of all ants on earth is more than the weight of all humans. 
</P>
<P>
	-- There are nearly 10,000 known species of ants, but scientists  
believe there actually may be two or three times this many in 
existence. Japan has about 260 species of ants, while there are 
about 700 species of ants in the United States and Canada. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Ants have one of the largest brains of all insects. An ant has  
about 250,000 brain cells. A human has about 10 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	-- The longest living ants -- wood ant queens -- are known to live  
more than 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Ants can lift up to 20 times their own body weight. If humans  
were this strong, a 150-pound person would be able to easily lift a 
walrus. Ants are not only strong, they are fast. If a person could 
run as fast for his size as an ant can, he could match the pace of 
a racehorse.

<HEADLINE> Normal Rainfall Won't Break Drought </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Good news: The weatherman expects normal  
rainfall in August. 
</P>
<P>
	Bad news: That won't even start to relieve the drought in much  
of the country. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need a couple of feet of water to get out of this. That's a  
couple of tropical storms,'' D. James Baker, administrator of the 
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Baker, appearing on CBS' ``Face the Nation,'' said the drought  
in the Northeast is the worst in 30 years and the second-worst of 
the century. 
</P>
<P>
	``Droughts take a long time to set up, and they take a long time  
to get rid of,'' Baker said. 
</P>
<P>
	``And in fact, even if we go back to normal rainfall for August,  
which is what we expect to have, it's not going to give up for a 
long time. In some parts of the country, it may go through the 
winter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On the same program, Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman said the  
ground is as dry in the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast as it has been 
since the Great Depression. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite that regional crisis, Glickman said, people in most  
places should expect no serious increases in food prices or supply. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ironically, the heartland of America ... Texas, Oklahoma,  
Kansas, Nebraska, Iowa, all through the middle -- they're doing 
pretty well now in terms of rainfall,'' Glickman said. ``That means 
that this drought and heat wave probably won't have any kind of 
dramatic effect on food prices or shortages.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There could be problems, however, in supplies of fresh produce  
in Northeastern cities, the secretary said. In parts of the region, 
he said, rainfall is 50 percent to 80 percent below normal.

<HEADLINE> Mall Offers Close-Up of Eye Surgery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FAIRFAX, Va. (AP) -- Squeamish shoppers beware: They're slicing  
eyeballs at the Fair Oaks Mall. 
</P>
<P>
	No, they're not filming a schlock horror movie. It's just  
business as usual at the Visual Freedom Center, believed to be the 
first eye surgery center to open in a shopping mall. 
</P>
<P>
	Passersby can watch the surgeries -- intended to correct  
nearsightedness and farsightedness -- live on a television screen. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ewwww,'' squealed a teen-age girl when she saw a closeup of an  
eye being clamped open. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yuck,'' said another mall rat as the eye was squirted with  
anesthetic and the cornea sliced and peeled back, exposing the area 
beneath, which was then zapped with a laser. 
</P>
<P>
	It's an odd marketing strategy, but for every grossed-out  
passerby there are dozens of shoppers who can't help but stop for a 
peek. 
</P>
<P>
	That's precisely what ophthalmologist Robert Johnston had in  
mind when he moved his office to the mall in February and began 
televising the operations. Bespectacled shoppers see how easy the 
procedure is and lose their fear, said marketing director Shannon 
Fredericks. 
</P>
<P>
	Patients can choose to close the curtains on the operating room  
and turn off the television, but only a few do so. 
</P>
<P>
	Tien Chau, 23, of Annandale, worked up the courage to have his  
eyes treated after watching his girlfriend, Thuy Nguyen, 23, have 
the operation the day before. Chau reasoned that doctors are less 
likely to butcher him with a crowd watching. 
</P>
<P>
	``My thoughts exactly,'' said a woman waiting nervously  
alongside Chau in the waiting room. 
</P>
<P>
	The surgery takes about 15 minutes and costs about $4,500 for  
both eyes. 
</P>
<P>
	The operation, which reshapes the cornea so that images properly  
hit the retina, is called Laser in-Situ Keratomileusis, or LASIK. 
The center of a nearsighted person's cornea is pulsed with the 
laser to reduce the curvature. 
</P>
<P>
	In a farsighted person, the periphery of the cornea is pulsed to  
remove tissue and add curvature. 
</P>
<P>
	Laser eye surgery is performed by ophthalmologists across the  
country, although the Visual Freedom Center is believed to be the 
first center to be located in a shopping mall, said Jan Beiting, 
spokeswoman for the American Society of Cataract and Refractive 
Surgery in Fairfax. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's definitely a buzz about it among our members,'' she  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the center moved to the mall from Johnston's office in  
Leesburg in February, business has jumped about 40 percent, with 
about 15 patients treated daily, Fredericks said. 
</P>
<P>
	The center has been so successful that a second shop will open  
in a Columbia, Md., mall in September. Two more are in the works 
for the Chicago and Washington-Baltimore areas by the end of the 
year, Fredericks said. 
</P>
<P>
	David Karcher, executive director of the American Society of  
Cataract and Refractive Surgery, cautioned against trivializing the 
seriousness of the procedure and said this is as close as 
physicians have come to ``going retail.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Craig Conroy, head of Conroy Research Group and a former mall  
developer, said the Visual Freedom Center is part of the ``doc in a 
box'' phenomenon in which physicians have moved out of their 
traditional sterile environments to attract customers. 
</P>
<P>
	Dentists' offices have been in malls for years, and  
chiropractors have made the move too, he said. While people may get 
sweaty palms when they walk into a hospital, nobody's nervous about 
visiting the mall. 
</P>
<P>
	``Malls have become the town squares in many communities, and it  
makes sense for physicians to locate there,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	And there's one other perk: Patients get free videos of the  
surgery -- for their friends who couldn't make it to the mall.

<HEADLINE> Broncos Give Punter a One-Game Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- The Denver Broncos will follow the lead  
of next Sunday's exhibition opponent, the San Diego Chargers, and 
give an Australian punter a chance at playing in the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
	The Super Bowl champions will give former Australian Football  
League player Jon Ballantyne a one-game tryout during the 
exhibition game at Sydney's Olympic Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	Chargers punter Darren Bennett is also a former AFL player and  
believes Ballantyne, who played for the Scottish Claymores in NFL 
Europe last season, is capable of becoming the next Aussie to earn 
an NFL roster spot. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've had a bit to do with him and from all I can see he's the  
next Aussie most likely to crack it,'' Bennett said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ballantyne is the second foreign kicker to get a shot at making  
the Broncos' roster during the offseason. 
</P>
<P>
	Spanish kicker Jesus Angoy joined the Broncos on a free-agent  
contract less than two weeks ago, but walked out last Thursday 
after just seven days with the team. 
</P>
<P>
	Ballantyne played 29 senior games in the AFL, a league in which  
long kicking is crucial. 
</P>
<P>
	Broncos coach Mike Shanahan, who will arrive with the team early  
Tuesday after the 16-hour flight from the United States, said 
Ballantyne was not signed up just for promotional purposes. 
</P>
<P>
	``The (European) NFL recommended we give this guy a tryout and  
he's got a pretty good reputation,'' Shanahan said. ``We don't do 
promotional visits. For us this is an important game so there's no 
way, not even in the case of a punter, that we would do something 
just for show.''

turf race Sunday, taking the lead in the final strides to capture 
the $400,000 Eddie Read Handicap by a neck over Ladies Din. 
</P>
<P>
	Ridden by Chris Antley and carrying 116 pounds, Joe Who covered  
1 1/8 miles in 1:48 3-5 and paid $15.40, $6.20 and $4.80. 
</P>
<P>
	The win was the 14th in 31 lifetime starts for Joe Who and was  
worth $240,000. The 6-year-old Brazilian-bred son of Jolly Quick 
won twice on the grass at Del Mar last summer. 
</P>
<P>
	Ladies Din, ridden by Kent Desormeaux and carrying 119 pounds,  
finished a half-length in front of Bouccaneer and returned $4.20 
and $3.40.

<HEADLINE> Workplace Violence Spurs Prevention </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Just a day after the Atlanta office shootings, the workplace  
violence prevention team at American Express convened by telephone 
to discuss coping with employees upset by the rampage. 
</P>
<P>
	At the clothing retailer The Limited, supervisors are trained to  
look for bruised employees, knowing that abusive lovers often 
pursue women at work. 
</P>
<P>
	Companies are waking up to the scope of violence at work.  
Murders, although declining in recent years, remain the 
second-leading cause of death on the job. 
</P>
<P>
	Companies are shaken by the rare but horrific cases in which a  
worker or customer runs amok, as chemist-turned-stock trader Mark 
O. Barton did Thursday in Atlanta, killing nine workers and 
customers and, separately, his wife and two children. 
</P>
<P>
	And increasingly, companies are being held liable for hiring  
violent employees or letting warning signs go unheeded. 
</P>
<P>
	``Companies are really under the gun -- literally -- to prevent  
violence and other hostile acts at work from happening,'' said 
Lynne McClure, author of ``Risky Business,'' a book on workplace 
violence. 
</P>
<P>
	This spring, a North Carolina jury awarded $7.9 million to the  
families of two men killed at a tool distribution center in 1995 by 
a violence-prone worker who had been fired. The jury found the 
center's two operators, Union Butterfield Corp. and Dormer Tools 
Inc., negligent in failing to protect them. 
</P>
<P>
	The fired worker had threatened to return and ``take management  
with me.'' Lawyers for the Asheville, N.C., companies are trying to 
get the verdict set aside. 
</P>
<P>
	``This man was a ticking time bomb and the management knew it,  
yet they did nothing to protect their employees,'' lawyer David 
Kirby, who represented the family of one killed worker, said in 
May. 
</P>
<P>
	Other companies have been held liable for ``negligent hiring,''  
or failing to check if a new hire has a propensity to violence. 
</P>
<P>
	Just Friday, a worker killed his boss and himself at a  
Charlotte, N.C., trucking terminal. Police said there had been a 
quarrel. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet despite the headlines, homicides at work are declining.  
There were 856 work-related murders in 1997, a 7 percent drop from 
1996 that mirrors the fall in violent crime nationwide during this 
economic boom, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. 
</P>
<P>
	Most work-related homicides happen during robberies and other  
crimes, often at restaurants or convenience stores. 
</P>
<P>
	But 81 people were killed in 1997 by workers, former co-workers  
or customers. And 44 people, or 5 percent of the total, were killed 
at work by spouses, lovers or ex-lovers -- up from 2 percent in 
1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Many companies don't want to even begin facing up to the  
problem. ``Too many things go unnoticed. We are in a constant state 
of denial,'' says Bruce Cedar, a psychologist and partner at CMG 
Associates in Newton, Mass., a consulting firm that specializes in 
workplace violence issues. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers say companies need to intervene promptly when a  
problem arises -- as American Express does via its 4-year-old 
``Threat Assessment Team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For instance, if a manager is afraid to fire a problem employee,  
the high-level team might help the manager plan the safest way to 
accomplish the task. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't take anything lightly,'' says team member Joanne  
Colucci, director of security services for the company. Other team 
members come from human resources, legal affairs and the employee 
assistance program. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of a recent campaign to combat domestic violence,  
American Express has given cell phones to victims of abuse, along 
with parking spaces close to front doors so they can avoid isolated 
parking areas. 
</P>

	At The Limited, supervisors are trained to look for telltale  
signs of domestic abuse, and hotline numbers are posted in rest 
rooms, where they can be discreetly jotted down. 
</P>

	``Domestic violence doesn't end at the home,'' said the  
campaign's leader, human resources chief Arnold Kanarick. ``The 
abuser will pursue the woman into the workplace.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Since the campaign began last fall, dozens of The Limited's  
employees have come forward asking for help, compared with just one 
or two previously, said spokesman Al Dietzel. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, many companies wait before acting. Recently, author Lynne  
McClure helped a company craft a progressive violence-prevention 
program that included monitoring problem employees. 
</P>
<P>
	What prompted the company's call to her? An attempted murder at  
work.

<P>
	WINNIPEG, Manitoba (AP) -- Canadian roller hockey goalie Steve  
Vezina failed a doping test at the Pan American Games and his team 
was stripped of its gold medal Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Vezina, who plays ice hockey for the Utah Grizzlies of the IHL  
and also is a professional roller hockey player, tested positive 
for two stimulants and ``an enormously high level'' of an anabolic 
steroid. It was the first doping incident at these games. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yesterday (Saturday) there was a rumor about a positive-doping  
athlete,'' Mario Vazquez Rana, president of the Pan American Sports 
Organization, said. ``As president of PASO, I apologize. We have to 
keep our rules and abide by our rules. 
</P>
<P>
	``Steve Vezina gave a positive result . . . we decided to  
withdraw the gold medal from the winning team, Canada.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The United States, which lost 7-6 to Canada in the gold medal  
game, was awarded the championships, with Argentina moving up to 
second and Brazil to third. 
</P>
<P>
	Vezina said after a preliminary round loss to Team USA that he  
lost 12 pounds during the game at Max Bell Arena, which is not air 
conditioned. He played well in the final after a shaky start, and 
was especially strong in the last 10 minutes, blanking the 
Americans. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's unfortunate,'' teammate Jeff Leiter said. ``What he did  
hurts all of us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The drug test showed three banned substances: ephedrine,  
pseudo-ephedrine and Nandrolone. Ephedrine and pseudoephedrine are 
stimulants used to avoid fatigue. Nandrolone is an anabolic steroid 
that increases muscle mass. 
</P>
<P>
	Vezina said at his drug test that he had taken Sudafed prior to  
competition. Many hockey players use Sudafed as an energy boost, 
and it is not banned in professional ice hockey leagues. 
</P>
<P>
	``It comes as a big shock ... Steve is not an abuser of anabolic  
steroids,'' said Lou Franceschetti, his coach with the Buffalo 
Wings of Roller Hockey International, which does not have a 
substance abuse policy. 
</P>
<P>
	``Until we have a chance to gather all of the facts and speak to  
everyone involved, Steve Vezina is scheduled to be in goal Friday 
against Dallas,'' Wings vice president of operations Benny Gulakiw 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Also Sunday, Royal Canadian Mounted Police officials confirmed  
that an athlete had sought asylum and was turned over to 
immigration authorities. Sources close to the Cuban team, on the 
condition they not be identified, said the athlete was from Cuba's 
track and field squad, but would not give his name. 
</P>
<P>
	He is the fifth Cuban to leave that nation's delegation to the  
games, and the fourth to seek asylum. 
</P>
<P>
	For all of their preliminary-round woes, the Cubans still made  
the Olympics in baseball when they beat Canada 3-2 in the 
semifinals. That avenged an 8-1 drubbing at the hands of the host 
team in pool play. 
</P>
<P>
	During the ninth inning, a spectator carrying a sign saying  
``Human Right First'' ran onto the field. He was chased by two 
Cuban players who came out of the dugout, then tackled by Cuba 
second baseman Juan Padilla. He then was escorted out of the 
stadium by security. 
</P>
<P>
	``The guy made us all look bad,'' said Canada left fielder Aaron  
Guiel, who struck out looking to end the game. ``But what is great 
about the U.S. and Canada is that you have the freedom to do that. 
I don't agree with what he did and I also don't agree with Cuba's 
politics, either.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After Luis Lazo got the final two outs, the Cubans swarmed their  
hefty relief pitcher and several players ran around waving their 
flag. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cubans did not comment after the game, but their actions  
made it clear how relieved they were to qualify for the gold medal 
game -- and for Sydney. 
</P>
<P>
	At night, the United States faced Mexico in the other semifinal  
for a spot in the 2000 Olympics. The Americans, who also beat the 
world champion Cubans in the opening round, defeated Mexico last 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Hours after their worst loss ever at the Pan Ams, the U.S. women  
awoke early Sunday and beat the Dominican Republic 92-80 to clinch 
a berth in the medals round. The women (2-1) had lost to Cuba 
95-64. 
</P>
<P>
	Only two U.S. baskets came from outside 10 feet -- a pair of  
3-pointers by Michelle Marciniak, who scored 16 points. Lynn Pride, 
driving the baseline at will, led the Americans with 20 points and 
11 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dominican's Teresa Duran led all scorers with 33 points.  
</P>
<P>
	The United States beat the Dominican Republic in three sets for  
the women's bronze medal in volleyball.

<HEADLINE>  Cohen Meets Georgian President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TBILISI, Georgia (AP) -- Defense Secretary William Cohen promised  
Georgia's president on Sunday that the United States would continue 
to help the Caucasus nation develop its armed forces. 
</P>
<P>
	Cohen met for an hour with President Eduard Shevardnadze and  
Georgian Defense Minister David Tevzadze on the last day of a tour 
that included Japan, South Korea and Ukraine. 
</P>
<P>
	``I attach great importance to this visit,'' Shevardnadze told  
reporters after the meeting. ``I express my gratitude to the United 
States for all the help it is rendering our independent state, 
including defense and border guarding issues. Our talks were 
constructive and we have discussed a wide range of topics.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cohen said that Georgia had become a model of a democratic  
state, and for that reason the United States would keep up its aid 
to the Georgian military. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States has already supplied Georgia with a Coast  
Guard ship, and it plans to provide six helicopters and spare 
parts. 
</P>
<P>
	Cohen also said that the United States would do its best to  
promote a peaceful settlement of the Abkhazian conflict. 
</P>
<P>
	Abkhazian separatists drove out Georgian government troops  
during a 1992-93 war and have run the province since then. They 
have obstructed the return of more than 300,000 ethnic Georgian 
refugees who fled the fighting, and peace talks have stalled. 
</P>
<P>
	The Black Sea province has been rocked by frequent ambushes and  
clashes despite the Russian peacekeepers who have been stationed in 
Abkhazia since the 1994 truce. 
</P>
<P>
	Shevardnadze has accused Russia of siding with separatists and  
blamed the Russian peacekeepers for failing to guarantee the 
refugees' return. 
</P>
<P>
	He has been pushing for greater Western security assistance, and  
said in the spring that Georgia would welcome the chance to join 
NATO. It is already a member of NATO's Partnership for Peace 
program. 
</P>
<P>
	However, NATO hasn't announced any plans to invite Georgia into  
the alliance.

<HEADLINE> White House Touts Welfare Changes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- All 50 states have moved the required number  
of people from welfare to work, the White House said Sunday, noting 
that 35 percent of the nation's welfare recipients held jobs in 
1998 or were actively preparing for work. 
</P>
<P>
	The president plans to promote those numbers on Tuesday at a  
welfare-to-work conference in Chicago, and use them to make the 
case for Congress to provide funding for services, such as child 
care, to aid the welfare-to-work transition. 
</P>
<P>
	Administration officials say the proportion of welfare  
recipients who are working is four times as high now as when the 
president took office in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	Nationally, the percentage of welfare recipients with jobs rose  
from 7 percent in 1992 to 27 percent last year. The remainder 
fulfilled their requirements by seeking work, or pursuing education 
or training. 
</P>
<P>
	Oregon had the highest employment rate, with 98.2 percent of  
welfare recipients working at least 20 hours a week during 1998. 
Montana was second with 78.3 percent, followed by Wisconsin with 64 
percent, Wyoming with 55.3 percent and Iowa with 56.9 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The lowest rates were reported in Maryland and South Carolina,  
each with 12.7 percent, North Carolina with 14.5 percent, New 
Mexico with 15.9 percent, Pennsylvania with 19.3 percent and 
Arkansas with 19.4 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The welfare law requires that 30 percent of families receiving  
aid have one parent who holds at least a part-time job. In 41 
states, 75 percent of two-parent families are required to have both 
parents working. 
</P>
<P>
	The two-parent work rates were lagging in 1998, the  
administration said. Of those 41 states, only 28 met the work 
requirements. 
</P>
<P>
	The figures represented the first full year of data since  
Clinton signed the welfare law in 1996. Not all states were 
required to report welfare-to-work statistics in 1997, and most 
that did offered data only for the last quarter of that year. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration reported in December that the required 25  
percent of welfare recipients were working in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	States that fail to meet the work requirements are subject to  
financial penalties, even though shrinking welfare rolls have 
caused $4 billion in federal welfare funds to go unclaimed at the 
Treasury Department. However, if a state's welfare caseload has 
dropped by 25 percent since 1995, then its welfare-to-work 
requirement also is reduced by 25 percentage points, meaning only 5 
percent of recipients must hold jobs.

	WINNIPEG, Manitoba (AP) -- Four members of the Cuban delegation  
to the Pan American Games were involved in a fight late Sunday with 
a protester who disrupted Cuba's baseball game with Canada. 
</P>
<P>
	The fight occurred at 10:30 p.m. in the center of the city  
outside the offices of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, 
acting duty inspector Paul Ingram of the Winnipeg City Police said. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was a bit of a disturbance,'' Ingram said. ``The police  
happened to be going by when it transpired.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The members of the Cuban delegation were sent back to their  
lodgings. Police were investigating the incident, but were unable 
to offer further details.

<HEADLINE> Purdue Basketball Player Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GARY, Ind. (AP) -- Purdue women's basketball player Tiffany Young  
was killed in a car accident Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
	The 21-year-old guard, a member of Purdue's 1999 NCAA national  
championship team, would have been a senior for the Boilermakers 
this season. 
</P>
<P>
	Young was with her boyfriend, also a Purdue student, visiting  
his family in Gary, according to a statement from the university. 
Young was apparently returning to West Lafayette with her boyfriend 
and an unidentified third passenger when the accident occurred. 
</P>
<P>
	The Post-Tribune of Gary reported that the students' car was hit  
by a drunk driver, according to the Purdue statement. The driver of 
the offending vehicle had a blood-alcohol content of .30 and was 
taken into custody by the Gary Police Department, the statement 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Gary Police Department would not release any further  
information about the accident or any charges pending. Young's 
boyfriend and the third passenger remained hospitalized, according 
to Purdue's statement. 
</P>
<P>
	The 5-foot-11 Young averaged 3.3 points and 1.5 rebounds in her  
three-year career and started all 33 games during the 1997-98 
season. Her career highs were 16 points and seven rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
	A physical therapy major and native of Hillsboro, Ala., Young  
was named to the Academic All-Big Ten team last season.

	GREEN BAY, Wis. (AP) -- Brett Favre may have looked a little

<HEADLINE> U.S.-Iran Relations Remain Stagnant </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Rarely in the long estrangement between the  
United States and Iran has there been even a glimmer of hope for a 
more normal relationship. 
</P>
<P>
	One such moment occurred two years ago with the election of a  
new Iranian president, Mohammad Khatami, a bookish intellectual who 
seemed more open to the West than his predecessors during the 
period of conservative Islamic rule in Iran. 
</P>
<P>
	But as Khatami prepares to observe his second anniversary in  
office on Tuesday, not much has changed in U.S.-Iranian relations 
despite American eagerness for a fresh start. Protests on Tehran 
streets have dimmed prospects even more. 
</P>
<P>
	Under Khatami, ``The only thing that has changed is an  
improvement in the atmosphere, which is a prerequisite for better 
relations in the future,'' said Richard Murphy, a former top State 
Department aide on the Middle East, who envisions a long 
evolutionary process between Washington and Tehran. 
</P>
<P>
	At times, Khatami's remarks have tantalized American officials.  
He has expressed regret over the hostage-taking at the American 
Embassy in Tehran in 1979 and he has appealed for a ``crack in the 
wall of mistrust'' between the two countries. He has said the 
Muslim world can learn from the West. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet, the Iranian president has stood firm in his opposition to  
the key American goal of a direct dialogue between the two 
governments. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S.-Iran alienation troubles the Clinton administration as  
it has previous American governments. For two decades, the United 
States has been without influence in a country whose physical size, 
population, oil reserves and geographic location give Iran a 
significance few others can match. 
</P>
<P>
	Before the 1979 revolution, Iran was a key U.S. partner for  
almost three decades. The seizure of power by anti-American clerics 
that year was perhaps the most significant strategic setback for 
the United States in the post-World War II era. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration sometimes seems to go out of its way not to  
offend the Iranian leadership. When students weary of political and 
social restrictions took to the streets in large-scale protests in 
early July, the administration maintained strict silence. Officials 
were mindful that vocal support for the students by the 
administration could be seen by hardliners in Iran as evidence that 
the protests were covertly orchestrated by the CIA. 
</P>
<P>
	Be that as it may, there has been nothing covert about the  
American role as Iran's ardent suitor in the past two years. 
Clinton, in his most direct public appeal to the longstanding 
enmity between the United States and Iran, has said he wants 
``genuine reconciliation with Iran.'' And in a speech a year ago, 
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright urged Iran to join the United 
States in drawing a ``road map leading to normal relations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The administration has eased sanctions to allow the sale of U.S.  
food and medicine to Iran, and has removed Iran from the official 
list of countries which are either sources or transit points for 
U.S.-bound narcotics. It has encouraged cultural and academic 
exchanges and expedited the visa-approval process. 
</P>
<P>
	Iran has not responded to these initiatives. It is unclear  
whether Khatami prefers the current stalemate or whether he is 
being thwarted by conservative mullahs who are loyal to Iran's 
``supreme leader,'' Ayatollah Ali Khamenei within whose Islam-based 
strictures all Iranians must operate, Khatami included. Just this 
past week, Khatami saw fit to swear his ``full obedience'' to 
Khamenei. 
</P>
<P>
	In its approach to the United States, Iran considers itself the  
aggrieved party. It has acknowledged a change in U.S. rhetoric 
toward Iran but points out U.S. sanctions remain in place. U.S. 
trade with Iran was barred in 1995. In 1996, a new law was approved 
requiring mandatory sanctions against any country that invests more 
that $40 million in Iran's energy sector. 
</P>
<P>
	On other points of friction with the United States, fewer  
instances of international terrorism are traceable to Iran these 
days than in the pre-Khatami era. As for the Middle East peace 
process, Khatami has modified Iran's earlier opposition to it but 
he disappointed U.S. officials earlier this year by meeting with an 
anti-Israeli Arab ``rejectionist'' group in Syria. 
</P>
<P>
	On human rights, personal freedoms have been expanded  
significantly under Khatami but the government has drawn strong 
international criticism for its arrest of 13 Iranian Jews this 
year. The 13 are accused of passing secrets to Israel and will be 
tried for espionage. 
</P>
<P>
	Meantime, private arms control analysts have raised concerns  
about Iran's potential for developing chemical, biological and 
nuclear weapons. The Khatami government denies it has any such 
programs. But on the nuclear front, Michael Eisenstadt of the 
Washington Institute on Near East said, ``There is a clear pattern 
of procurement which signals non-peaceful intent.''

<TEXT>
<P>
	COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) -- Stern John scored three goals Sunday to  
power the Columbus Crew over the Miami Fusion 4-0 in a Major League 
Soccer game. 
</P>
<P>
	With the win, Columbus snapped Miami's four-game winning streak  
to close within four points of first-place D.C. United. 
</P>
<P>
	John got the fourth hat trick of his career with goals in the  
12th, 83rd and 90th minutes to move into third place in MLS scoring 
with 28 points. 
</P>
<P>
	Columbus substitute Brian West had two assists after entering  
the game in the 60th minute. 
</P>
<P>
	John's first goal came off assists by Jeff Cunningham and John  
DeBrito. Then in the second half, West stole the ball at midfield, 
dribbled down the left sideline and sent a rolling pass just past 
diving goalkeeper Garth Lagerwey to John, who scored from 6 yards 
out. 
</P>
<P>
	John got his first hat trick of the season in the final minute  
off a cross by West. Robert Warzycha also assisted on the play. 
</P>
<P>
	Columbus (13-7) dominated the game, outshooting Miami 19-8 and  
12-3 in shots on goal. 
</P>
<P>
	Miami's best chance came in the 65th minute when Jay Heaps'  
volley from 18 yards out was deflected inside the box, but 
Columbus' defense recovered to clear the ball.

	PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Peacekeepers scrambled to keep a lid  
on simmering ethnic tensions after a bomb damaged a Serbian 
Orthodox church under construction in Kosovo's capital today. The 
early morning blast did little damage to the structure, but it

House making the case against cuts of any size. ``We are much 
further apart than the public understands,'' said Sen. Phil Gramm, 
R-Texas. GOP and Democratic moderates still held out hope for a 
compromise that would give Americans a tax cut over the next 
decade. But one moderate, Sen. John Chafee, R-R.I., said there was 
a good chance neither side would get what it wanted.

<HEADLINE> Calif. Needs Help Controlling Pike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PORTOLA, Calif. (AP) -- The screen-saver on one City Hall  
worker's computer says it all: ``Northern Pike: 36. Fish and Game: 
0.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A joy to Midwest anglers, the northern pike is the misery of  
Portola, a Sierra Nevada town that has come to view the rapacious, 
sharp-toothed predator as a nemesis -- and to fear efforts to 
control it. 
</P>
<P>
	``The people here are scared to death that some magical number  
is going to be crunched and the state will decide to chemically 
treat Lake Davis again,'' said Fran Roudebush, a supervisor in 
rugged Plumas County, 250 miles east of San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
	Residents fear that magical number may have been reached last  
week, when state Fish and Game Department agents using electric 
fish-stunning probes pulled 22 pike from the lake in three hours. 
That makes 36 caught since May. 
</P>
<P>
	So California now faces the same dilemma it confronted two years  
ago: How to protect the state's vast fisheries from the fierce and 
fertile northern pike, a nonnative predator that gobbles trout and 
salmon, sometimes whole. 
</P>
<P>
	In October 1997, after a bitter court fight, the state poured  
60,000 pounds of poison powder and 16,000 gallons of liquid 
chemicals into the 7-mile-long lake to eradicate the pike, which 
state investigators believe were planted by anglers who prize the 
pike for its fighting qualities. 
</P>
<P>
	The azure water turned an odd shade of green and the fish died,  
the pike as well as the trout. The local tourist-based economy 
faltered, the water remained tainted for months and residents were 
outraged. State authorities said the action was supported by the 
best available science, and was necessary to prevent northern pike 
from spreading into California's rivers. 
</P>
<P>
	Pike experts in other states generally agreed.  
</P>
<P>
	California later approved a $10 million settlement to resolve  
scores of local claims. The lake's water now is perfectly safe to 
drink, state scientists say, but skeptical residents prefer newly 
dug municipal wells. 
</P>
<P>
	After the lake was restocked with a million trout, tourists  
returned. 
</P>
<P>
	But now, the pike are back -- game officials don't know how -- and  
the 2,300 residents of nearby Portola are not pleased. 
</P>
<P>
	And with all the trout stocked in the lake, some fishermen also  
are leery of any threat to poison the lake again. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd hate to see the pike get into the Feather River system,  
but I used to come up here and get two to three fish at most. On 
rare days, I'd get the limit. Now, I catch more, big 'planters' 
(stocked trout),'' said Bryant Martin of Applegate as he displayed 
his catch. He said his young son caught a 6-pound trout. 
</P>
<P>
	At a closed-door meeting, state and local experts considered  
options that included electric nets and using ultraviolet light to 
zap the fish, which one official described as ``a kind of killer 
sun tan.'' A public meeting is planned Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	It's the possibility that poison will be used again that worries  
residents most. 
</P>
<P>
	``They don't trust government. I am government, and I don't  
trust government,'' said Roudebush, the county supervisor. 
</P>
<P>
	Portola residents made it clear they want California to get  
advice from experts in Minnesota, Wisconsin and other states where 
the popular pike are managed with little difficulty, and last week 
state authorities began issuing invitations. 
</P>
<P>
	Wildlife officials in Minnesota have effectively managed the  
aggressive pike, but they caution that the fish is native there, 
and that regular efforts are made to keep them away from trout. 
</P>
<P>
	Like California, Minnesota has treated lakes with chemicals, but  
on a much smaller scale and for different reasons, such as 
eradicating carp. 
</P>
<P>
	``Once you have the introduction of a nonnative species taking  
place, you can't just go and take a small net and get those fish 
back,'' said Roy Johannes, fisheries coordinator for Minnesota's 
Department of Natural Resources. 
</P>
<P>
	``And if you don't get them at the first crack, you're taking a  
risk,'' he added.

<HEADLINE> US Baseball Qualifies for Olympics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WINNIPEG, Manitoba (AP) -- From the minors to the Olympics.  
</P>
<P>
	The United States left it up to minor league players to get it  
into the 2000 Games, and they came through Sunday night by edging 
Mexico 2-1 in 10 innings at the Pan American Games. 
</P>
<P>
	The victory assured the Americans a spot in the gold medal game  
Monday against world champion Cuba. The two finalists in the Pan 
Ams automatically qualify for Sydney. 
</P>
<P>
	Cuba beat Canada 3-2.  
</P>
<P>
	With one out in top of 10th, Marcus Jensen, America's top hitter  
in the tournament, doubled off the first-base bag. After a 
strikeout, pinch-hitter Mike Neill, a longtime minor leaguer, hit a 
3-2 pitch for a run-scoring single to right-center field off former 
major league pitcher Vicente Palacios. 
</P>
<P>
	Dan Wheeler, who pitched well in a 10-5 win over Cuba in the  
preliminary round, got the victory. The right-hander from Triple-A 
Durham pitched a perfect four innings in relief. 
</P>
<P>
	The Americans had a run cut down at the plate in the second when  
Craig Paquette tried to score from first on a double by Milton 
Bradley. Then Mexico took a 1-0 lead in the fourth on an RBI double 
by Ray Martinez. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. team, comprised of players not on the 40-man roster of  
major league clubs, struggled all night against former major 
leaguer Cesar Alvarez. But the Americans finally scored in the 
sixth. A walk, a bunt and a two-out single by Adam Kennedy got the 
run. 
</P>
<P>
	Alvarez allowed only three hits in 7 2-3 innings and had 10  
strikeouts. 
</P>
<P>
	Cuba, the two-time defending Olympic champion, overcame the  
distraction of a ninth-inning protester. It was sweet revenge for 
the Cubans, who were rocked by preliminary-round losses to Canada, 
8-1, and the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Omar Linares, regarded as his nation's best player, hit a  
two-out, three-run homer in the third inning. Jose Ibar pitched 5 
1-3 innings of strong relief before he lost concentration after 
retiring the first batter in the ninth. 
</P>
<P>
	That's when a man carrying a ``Human Right First'' sign came  
onto the field in front of the mound. Cuba's Yobal Duenas rushed 
out of the dugout with his country's flag and tried to wrap up the 
protester. 
</P>
<P>
	The man, wearing a shirt with ``Freedom'' written on the front,  
then ran behind home plate. Cuban catcher Ariel Pestano tried to 
stop the protester with his mask before the man ran in front of the 
Canadian dugout, where he was apparently knocked down by Cuban 
second baseman Juan Padilla. Authorities then took the man away. 
</P>
<P>
	Ibar gave up a single to Todd Betts, threw a wild pitch and  
walked Ryan Radmanovich before Luis Lazo came on to strike out the 
final two hitters. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this year when the Cubans beat the Baltimore Orioles in  
an exhibition at Camden Yards, a protester ran onto the field 
before he was tackled by a Cuban umpire. 
</P>
<P>
	Canadian left fielder Aaron Guiel, who struck out to end the  
game, was in front of the dugout when the protester was trying to 
get away. 
</P>
<P>
	``The guy made us all look bad,'' Guiel said. ``But what is  
great about the U.S. and Canada is that you have the freedom to do 
that. I don't agree with what he did and I also don't agree with 
Cuba's politics, either.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the opening round, Guiel twice ran over Pestano at the plate.  
On Sunday, he was nearly in the middle of another physical 
confrontation. 
</P>
<P>
	``One of their coaches tried to throw a punch and another player  
tried to throw his mask at him. I had my bat in my hand and another 
guy was beside me,'' Guiel said. ``We just stood in between. It's a 
good thing for them they didn't show any aggression toward us. Then 
there would have been some real trouble.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``In a way I understand it. But basically those guys are  
brainwashed into thinking the way their country runs is the way it 
should be run. ...Unfortunately it was a little blemish on the 
game, a great game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Canada had won all five of its games entering the semifinals.  
</P>
<P>
	``Probably the toughest loss I've ever had to take,'' Guiel  
said. ``We were one run, one blooper, one error away from 
qualifying for the Olympics.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Canadians took a 2-0 lead on a run-scoring wild pitch in the  
second and a third-inning solo homer from Stubby Clapp. 
</P>
<P>
	Canadian starter Mike Meyers retired the first two batters in  
the third before Luis Ulacia and Isacc Martinez singled. Linares 
then drove a long homer to left. 
</P>
<P>
	Ibar relieved in the fourth and allowed only one hit into the  
ninth. 
</P>
<P>
	After Lazo got the final two outs, the Cubans, winners of seven  
straight Pan Ams golds, swarmed their hefty relief pitcher. Several 
players ran out of the dugout with their flag. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cubans did not comment after the game, but their actions  
made it clear how relieved they were to qualify for the gold medal 
game -- and for the Olympics.

<HEADLINE> Volker Sets World Backstroke Record </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ISTANBUL, Turkey (AP) -- Germany's Sandra Volker broke her world  
record in the 50-meter backstroke at the European Swimming 
Championships on Sunday, and Pieter Van den Hoogenband of the 
Netherlands emerged as the new star of the meet. 
</P>
<P>
	Volker was first off the blocks to finish in 28.71 seconds and  
defeat Spain's Nina Jivanevskaia (29.02). Metka Sparavec of 
Slovenia got the bronze in 29.25. Volker broke her mark of 28.78 
last month in Monte Carlo. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know myself where I got the power from for this world  
record,'' Volker said. ``All the races seem to have drained me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Holland's Pieter Van den Hoogenband defeated world and European  
champion Alexander Popov of Russia, swimming the 50-meter freestyle 
in 22.06. The Russian left the pool with his first bronze medal, 
behind Italy's Lorenzo Vismara. Vismara was second in 22.21 while 
Popov clocked 22.32. 
</P>
<P>
	Hoogenband has been unbeatable so far, delivering fast  
performances in every one of the five events he has entered. 
Holland's disqualification in the 800 relay Saturday robbed him of 
the fastest relay leg of all time in 1:45.20. 
</P>
<P>
	Runaway record breaker Inge de Bruijn took her 50-meter  
freestyle race in 24.99. Therese Alshammar of Sweden was second in 
25.30 and Alison Sheppard of Britain was third in 25.33. 
</P>
<P>
	Marcel Wouda, another star in the new Dutch swimming powerhouse,  
goes for gold in the 400 medley. But he faces tough competition 
from Italy's Alessio Boggiatto, Spain's Frederik Hviid, and 
Germany's Jirka Letzin. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dutch pair of Kirsten Vlieghuis and Cara Geurts are favored  
in the 400-meter women's freestyle, with their main competition 
coming from Camelia Potec of Romania. 
</P>
<P>
	In the 200-meter women's butterfly, Denmark goes for its first  
medal with Mette Jacobsen, who swims against Katrin Jaeke of 
Germany and Spain's Maria Pelaez. 
</P>
<P>
	The 11-day meet ends with the men and women's 400 medley relays.  
There also will be finals in women's 10-meter synchronized diving 
and the men's 3-meter springboard.

<HEADLINE> BBC Domination of British TV Wanes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- For just $11.25 a head, visitors to an attraction  
in central London called The BBC Experience can participate in 
British Broadcasting Corp.'s lavish and loving tribute to itself. 
</P>
<P>
	Having crackled to life on the airwaves more than 75 years ago,  
the government-supported broadcasting behemoth surely is deserving 
of such a touristy fuss. 
</P>
<P>
	``Auntie,'' as the BBC is affectionately known, has seen Britain  
through the best and worst of the century -- ever traditional, 
respectable and reliable, if not a bit stuffy. The clipped tones of 
its news announcers remained a reassuring constant as the decades 
rushed by. 
</P>
<P>
	But the people running the BBC these days can't afford to spend  
much time celebrating the past. They're too busy trying to stay 
relevant to a fragmented audience and deflecting a barrage of 
criticism. 
</P>
<P>
	``Is there anybody who seriously believes the corporation is  
offering the quality it once did?'' The Daily Mail lamented in a 
recent editorial. 
</P>
<P>
	Increased competition, sinking ratings and internal strife have  
thrown the BBC out of sorts, prompting calls for the government to 
reconsider the institution's traditional funding source -- the $164 
television license that Britons must buy annually, under penalty of 
law, for the privilege of switching on their TV sets. 
</P>
<P>
	That arrangement raises $3.2 billion a year for the BBC. But it  
also forces its leaders to walk a schizophrenic line between 
traditional public-service commitments and the mainstream 
popularity demanded by consumers who want sitcoms, racy soap operas 
and game shows along with their sober 6 o'clock news and 
award-winning documentaries. 
</P>
<P>
	As its long domination of radio and TV wanes, the BBC has become  
painfully aware that being all things to all people isn't so easy 
anymore. 
</P>
<P>
	With five national radio networks, 40 local radio services, two  
over-the-air TV channels, plus cable and 24-hour news offerings, 
the BBC still commands a large chunk of the listening and viewing 
audience in Britain. 
</P>
<P>
	About 94 percent of the population tunes in for at least two  
hours a week, and even the BBC's harshest critics agree it does 
many things well. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the audience share of BBC1, the flagship TV channel, has  
fallen below 30 percent for the first time. New sitcoms have been 
so bad that programming heads issued an edict to make them funnier. 
And BBC traditions such as England's cricket matches and major 
soccer have been lost to higher-bidding commercial TV and satellite 
services. 
</P>
<P>
	Morale inside the BBC has sagged from corporate-style  
cost-cutting measures, and key people have bailed out. Media 
pundits proclaim Auntie just ain't what she used to be, and ask 
whether the license fee is too high a price just to watch TV 
without commercials. 
</P>
<P>
	Part of the problem, critics say, is that the BBC under current  
Director-General John Birt has turned away from its public-service 
mission to do battle with commercial media and expand the network's 
reach around the world. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997, that included a new menu of four cable and  
satellite-delivered commercial TV channels -- the first BBC-backed 
offerings ever to carry advertising. 
</P>
<P>
	Months later, a 24-hour news channel was launched to compete  
with CNN and British Sky Broadcasting's around-the-clock Sky News. 
Money was also pumped into developing a comprehensive Internet 
site. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year came partnerships with U.S. broadcasters, and  
contracts to sell favorite shows from the BBC's archives around the 
world. That included the debut of the BBC America cable channel in 
the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it is perhaps trying to do too much,'' said Vicki  
Wegg-Prosser, who teaches broadcasting policy at the University of 
Westminster in London and is secretary of a 2,000-member national 
consumer group called Voice of the Listener and Viewer. 
</P>
<P>
	Sneering from the purists turned to outrage when the BBC was  
outbid last year for the rights to domestic cricket matches by two 
other networks, ending a 40-year tradition of the sport on BBC1. 
The BBC already had lost Formula One car racing, England rugby 
games and the annual FA Cup soccer championship. 
</P>
<P>
	Public relations suffered another hit in February when the BBC  
decided to cancel ``One Man and His Dog,'' a weekly program of 
sheepdog trials that had run 23 years. Country viewers, already 
feeling underappreciated, saw it as a further snub. 
</P>
<P>
	BBC executives staunchly defend the diversification, saying the  
profit-making ventures enable them to offer more to the 
license-payer. They note that revenues are up -- the worldwide 
syndication of ``Teletubbies'' alone brought in $51 million last 
year -- and that the cost of running the BBC has been cut during 
Birt's seven years at the helm. 
</P>
<P>
	But, apparently, they're heeding the complaints, too.  
</P>
<P>
	In unveiling its new program lineup recently, the BBC said it  
was pulling out of the ratings war with longtime commercial rival 
ITV. It will focus more on educational programs and high-quality 
drama than the game shows and soap operas that make ITV the 
top-rated station in Britain. 
</P>
<P>
	``All the BBC's services need to hold their nerve as they face  
growing competition, and offer programs of range and distinction, 
in peaktime and off-peak, which set them apart from the market,'' 
Birt said. 
</P>
<P>
	In the corporation's annual review in June, the BBC board of  
governors went a step further, urging programming chiefs to pursue 
``an unashamedly public service schedule.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Birt is set to retire as director-general next year, and will be  
replaced as head of the 23,000-employee operation by TV production 
wizard Greg Dyke, whose previous experience is all in commercial 
television. 
</P>
<P>
	When he was introduced as the new $600,000-a-year chief in June,  
Dyke said the BBC must preserve the license fee if it is to do all 
that's expected of it. 
</P>
<P>
	``If, like me, you have spent your adult life in broadcasting,  
you know that the BBC sets the standards which the rest of us try 
to follow,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is an outstanding journalistic and program-making  
organization,'' he said. ``It has a reputation for honesty, 
fairness and, most of all, independence, and I am determined to 
safeguard and protect that.''

<HEADLINE> Nets Sign Van Horn, Feick </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Keith Van Horn, the cornerstone of the New Jersey Nets' future,  
and Jamie Feick, the surprise of last year's disappointing season, 
reached agreements Sunday on new multi-year contracts. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nets rewarded Van Horn for leading the team in scoring in  
his first two years by giving him an NBA maximum-length, six-year 
contract extension valued at roughly $73 million. The deal will 
keep him under contract until 2006. 
</P>
<P>
	Keeping Feick, who was a free agent, was a bonus. The Utah Jazz  
also sought his services after he led the Nets in rebounding in the 
lockout-shortened season. 
</P>
<P>
	``Keith is obviously one of the premier young players in the  
league and Jamie is an emerging player,'' Nets general manager John 
Nash said Sunday in a telephone conference call. 
</P>
<P>
	Locking up Van Horn was a no brainer for the Nets, who missed  
the playoffs last season as coach John Calipari was fired after the 
team lost 17 of its first 20 games. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was an automatic, quite frankly,'' Nash said. ``We said  
from the beginning, there was no mystery about the fact that Keith 
is one of our more important players and so from the first 
opportunity we had to talk to him and his representatives, we 
wanted to do everything in our power to maintain his services. 
</P>
<P>
	Van Horn, a 6-foot-10 power forward with the moves of a small  
forward, averaged 20.5 points and 7.4 rebounds in his first two 
seasons. He led the team in scoring each year, averaging 19.7 
points as a rookie and 21.8 last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Van Horn was in Switzerland and was not available for comment.  
</P>
<P>
	``I am excited about the basketball future of the Nets,'' he  
said in a statement released by the team. ``When we picked up 
Stephon (Marbury), he was the last piece of the puzzle to build a 
championship team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Van Horn, who has had hand surgery since the end of the season,  
scored 20 or more points 28 times last season and recorded a 
career-high 35 points Feb. 16 against Detroit. He shot just under 
43 percent from the field, including 30 percent from 3-point range, 
and was just under 86 percent from the free throw line, including a 
streak of 48 in a row. 
</P>
<P>
	Feick, 25, was one of the surprises of last season. He averaged  
6.3 points and 10.3 rebounds in 28 games with New Jersey, getting 
the bulk of the playing time after Jayson Williams broke his leg. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams has been slow in recovering from the injury, which  
forced the Nets to put even greater emphasis on signing Feick. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought Jamie was a priority signing outside of (Keith), for  
a lot of reasons,'' coach Don Casey said. ``He gives us additional 
depth and secondly, if Jayson at either position would need some 
support or while waiting for him to completely heal, I think Jamie 
established himself last year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Nets gave Feick the middle-class exception starting at $2  
million with annual 10 percent increases for six years, making the 
deal worth about $15 million.

<HEADLINE> Lyonne Proud of Her New York Roots </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Newcomer Natasha Lyonne is a brash New Yorker --  
and proud of it. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you're born and raised in New York, you're just ruder  
naturally,'' Lyonne, who costars in ``American Pie,'' says in 
Sundays Daily News. ``The only thing I wish about New York is that 
I could work only in New York and could just make New York movies 
with New York filmmakers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Before ``American Pie,'' the 20-year-old had a scene-stealing  
part as a precocious teen in ``The Slums of Beverly Hills.'' She 
also played Woody Allen's wisecracking daughter in ``Everyone Says 
I Love You.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Woody was the one who gave me the blast of hope,'' she said.  
``It was worth it to continue the struggle. If someone like Woody 
Allen could care, maybe somebody else would.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lyonne's next movie is ``Detroit Rock City,'' about a group of  
kids trying to get into a KISS concert. Still, regardless of the 
city names in her movie titles, Lyonne is haunted by her New York 
image. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm so sick of hearing, `You're too New York,''' she said.  
``What does that mean?''

<HEADLINE> Nothstein Wins Record 3 Cycling Golds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WINNIPEG, Manitoba (AP) -- Marty Nothstein got his hat trick.  
</P>
<P>
	The 1996 Olympic silver medalist in cycling set his goal at the  
Pan American Games as winning three gold medals, a feat never 
achieved in his sport. He took the match sprint, Olympic spring and 
Keirin events. 
</P>
<P>
	``I fulfilled my goal of winning three gold medals and  
dominating in winning those three events,'' said Nothstein, of 
Trexlertown, Pa., who has won four world titles and 15 national 
championships. ``The only thing better than this would be to repeat 
this feat in Sydney next year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nothstein, 28, won twice Saturday night. He teamed with Marcelo  
Arrue of Woodland Hills, Calif., and Johnny Bairos of Redlands, 
Calif., in the Olympic sprint to defeat Cuba. His third gold came 
in the Keirin, a seven-lap race that is motorpaced for the first 4 1/2 
laps. 
</P>
<P>
	``By winning three golds, I made history,'' Nothstein said. ``I  
think we showed people that the United States is a power in the 
sport of track cycling.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In all, the Americans have won eight gold medals, six silver and  
one bronze, their best Pan Ams showing. And there still are four 
events to go in cycling. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *ANOTHER NO-HITTER:* Ho-hum. Another shutout, another no-hitter.  
</P>
<P>
	Lisa Fernandez's gem late Saturday night in the U.S. women's 5-0  
softball victory over Cuba featured 15 strikeouts. She walked one 
batter, in the fourth inning. 
</P>
<P>
	The unbeaten world champions allowed a total of four hits in  
their first four games, with Danielle Henderson opening the Pan Am 
competition with a perfect game. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously I'm disappointed I walked someone,'' said  
Ferndandez, of Long Beach, Calif., and generally considered the 
best pitcher in the world. ``When you get in that situation and 
your team is up by four runs, you hate to give someone a free pass. 
I think that was the downer of the whole game.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *MEDALS RETURNED:* Three bronze medals were stolen from the  
Canadian men's water polo team -- and then returned. 
</P>
<P>
	After taking the bronze on Friday, team members were celebrating  
in a downtown Winnipeg restaurant. Their vehicle was broken into 
and personal belongings, including the three medals, were taken. 
</P>
<P>
	The medals, belonging to Garrett Head, Zoltan Csepregi and Alex  
Thibeault, were returned Sunday, however. Winnipeg police learned 
they were in a mailbox near the Winnipeg Convention Centre, and 
with the help of the Canadian postal service, the medals were 
retrieved. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *CLOSING CEREMONY UPHEAVAL:* A new configuration for the stage  
at the Pan Am Games closing ceremony next Sunday has forced 
thousands of fans to exhange their tickets. 
</P>
<P>
	Kim Browning, vice president of ticket sales for the games, said  
the new stage placement for the Guess Who, which is reuniting for 
the ceremony, dropped the seating capacity by 3,500 to 24,000. 
Anyone in sections affected by the new logistics must exchange 
their tickets for different seats. Organizers said those fans also 
will have better views from their new seats. 
</P>
<P>
	But organizers said they could not reach ticket holders who did  
not buy by credit card, except by advertising the changes through 
the media. Anyone attending the closing ceremony with a ticket in 
the blocked-off sections will automatically be switched once they 
get to Winnipeg Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *FAVORITE SON:* The folks in Okmulgee, Okla., have a special  
interest in the Pan Am Games. 
</P>
<P>
	Their favorite son, Kermit Holmes, is playing for the U.S. men's  
basketball team, and they're doing all they can to keep tabs on 
him. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're keeping up with me every day,'' said Holmes, who plays  
for the CBA's Quad City Thunder. ``They're on line, they're reading 
the papers. They're eating this up right now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A former Oklahoma University player, Holmes hasn't forgotten his  
roots. He goes back home during the offseason and runs a camp for 
youngsters every summer. He had 181 campers this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm proud to be from there,'' Holmes said. ``I've been living  
there for 30 years. I still stay there with my mom. My grandmother 
lives on First Street and we live on Third Street. So it's a small 
community. I'm representing them up here also.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Holmes has spent his entire seven-year pro career in the CBA.  
But he has seen a bit of the world during those years and still 
marvels at the opportunities that have come his way, even if the 
NBA hasn't been one of them. 
</P>
<P>
	He has played in Spain, South America, Puerto Rico and Turkey  
and now he's in Winnipeg. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't explain the joy,'' Holmes said. ``Every day I say to  
myself, if I'm in Winnipeg or on my way back from Istanbul or 
Uruguay, `I'm from Okmulgee, Oklahoma, and it's been a heck of a 
ride.' ''

<HEADLINE>  US 92, Dominican Republic 80 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WINNIPEG, Manitoba (AP) -- Nothing like a little morning run to  
work out the frustrations from the night before. 
</P>
<P>
	Hours after suffering its worst loss ever in women's basketball  
at the Pan American Games, the United States awoke early Sunday and 
beat the Dominican Republic 92-80 to clinch a berth in the medal 
round. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think any basketball team when you lose by 30 points the  
game before, you want to come out and reprove yourself that you're 
not that bad,'' U.S. guard Michelle Marciniak said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The only thing we wanted to do was push the ball up and down  
the floor and get into the flow of a basketball game and just 
play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. men also played, meeting Brazil later Sunday.  
</P>
<P>
	The women (2-1), who lost to Cuba 95-64 on Saturday night, got  
their running game going for the first time in the tournament, 
resulting in a succession of layups and easy baskets inside. 
</P>
<P>
	Only two U.S. baskets came from outside 10 feet -- a pair of  
3-pointers by Marciniak, who scored 16 points. Lynn Pride, driving 
the baseline at will, led the Americans with 20 points and 11 
rebounds, Danielle McCulley scored 11 and Edwina Brown 10. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm excited to see us score that much,'' U.S. coach Nell  
Fortner said. ``Our transition game was working today and we took 
it at them. And that was one of our goals. Don't settle for 
pull-ups, take it to the hole. We didn't think they could guard 
us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The only problem for the Americans was that for much of the  
game, they couldn't guard Teresa Duran, who led all scorers with 33 
points. 
</P>
<P>
	Duran's 3-pointer drew the Dominican Republic (0-3) to 75-68  
with 9:52 remaining. But she made only two more baskets and the her 
team never got that close again as the taller Americans continued 
to pound away inside. 
</P>
<P>
	Pride, the most athletic of the U.S. players, was only 6-for-18  
in the first two games. She made a number of nice moves, but 
couldn't get the shots to fall. Sunday, she finished those moves, 
making six of her first eight shots and finishing 8-for-16. 
</P>
<P>
	``We tried to work with Lynn on making the easy play,'' Fortner  
said. ``Sometimes she makes the shot harder than it actually is. Go 
up and make the easy shot, just turn and shoot the ball. She really 
concentrated on that today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pride, who'll be a senior at Kansas, said it was all in her  
head. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just had a whole different attitude this game,'' she said.  
``It was a big game and I knew I had to come out mentally prepared. 
It was just go up, because they really couldn't match up with us in 
the post area.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brazil (3-0), Canada (2-1) and Cuba (2-1) also made the  
semifinals. The final two days of preliminary play will determine 
the seedings. 
</P>
<P>
	The Americans play Brazil on Monday and Canada on Wednesday.

<P>
	FORT-DE-FRANCE, Martinique (AP) -- Olympic sprinter Hermann  
Panzo, who won a bronze medal for France at the 1980 Games in 
Moscow, has died at the age of 41. 
</P>
<P>
	Panzo died Friday in a Fort-de-France hospital, apparently from  
complications from a stroke and heart attack he suffered last week, 
local media reported Saturday.

<P>
	Panzo, a Martinique native, won the bronze as part of a French  
four-man 100-meter relay team in the 1980 Games. 
</P>
<P>
	``With Hermann's death, we've lost not only a great athlete but  
also a symbol,'' Alain Rousselin, former Martinique Athletic League 
president, said Saturday on Radio Caraibes International. 
</P>
<P>
	Panzo ended his Olympic career after the 1984 Games in Los  
Angeles and worked as a technical counselor for Martinique's sports 
department.

<HEADLINE> Bates Right at Home With Bears </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PLATTEVILLE, Wis. (AP) -- Making the jump to the NFL was easier  
for D'Wayne Bates than most rookies. 
</P>
<P>
	There were no horror stories about him getting lost when he  
arrived in a new city. He didn't have to find a new place to live. 
When it was time for practice, all he had to do was drive a couple 
of miles up the road. 
</P>
<P>
	After four years at Northwestern, Chicago is Bates' home almost  
as much as his hometown of Aiken, S.C., is. And since South 
Carolina doesn't really have its own football team, getting drafted 
by the Bears was about as perfect as it could get. 
</P>
<P>
	``I really have grown to love Chicago,'' he said. ``I was happy  
I got the chance to stay here. It's a great city, a great city for 
football.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bates and the Bears are hoping he has the same kind of success  
in the NFL as he had at Northwestern, where he's the all-time 
leader in receptions (210), yards (3,370) and touchdowns (26). In 
1995, he helped lead the Wildcats to the Rose Bowl, and had 145 
yards on seven catches against Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
	But Bates found out pretty quickly that the NFL is a long way  
from the Big Ten. 
</P>
<P>
	``My first minicamp, it took me awhile to adjust, especially  
speed,'' he said. ``Everybody on the field is an athlete, and you 
just can't run by anybody. You've got to come out here at the top 
of your game every day, every play. You take one play off and you 
get taken out just like that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bates is finding ways to stand out, though. He's had impressive  
catches each day in practice, including one that drew cheers from 
the otherwise quiet spectators. 
</P>
<P>
	He's also developing a reputation as one of the most mature  
rookies. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm extremely pleased with what speed he has, I'm pleased with  
his catching ability, I'm pleased with his athletic ability,'' 
receivers coach Mike Borich said. ``But what I'm most impressed 
with is his mind and what he sees. The way he can communicate and 
the decisions he can make so quickly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That's because Bates sometimes knows exactly what the  
quarterback is thinking. No, he doesn't have a psychic business 
going on the side. Before he became a standout receiver at 
Northwestern, he was a star quarterback in South Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
	He threw for over 1,000 yards and 11 touchdowns as a high school  
senior, and rushed for another 580 yards and 11 TDs. He was the 
county player of the year and an all-state selection. 
</P>
<P>
	``We seem to say it about D'Wayne all the time because it's  
true: He's consistent, he's smart, he's in the right place at the 
right time,'' Jauron said. 
</P>
<P>
	He isn't perfect, though. He needs to increase his yardage after  
a catch, Jauron said, lowering his pads and turning the ball 
upfield before he runs. And Bates said he wants to get more precise 
in his routes, like teammate Curtis Conway. 
</P>
<P>
	So he watches Conway in practice and on film -- just like he did  
a few years ago. When he made the switch to receiver in college, 
Bates studied hours of tape of Conway and his favorite player, 
Jerry Rice, and tried to emulate them on the field. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm just trying to gain all the knowledge I can right now,''  
Bates said. ``Now I can make my own name, and that's my goal.''

<HEADLINE> Senate Passes Tax Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republicans pushed their $792 billion tax cut  
through the Senate on Friday, courting a classic veto struggle this 
fall with President Clinton and Democrats who claim the measure 
shortchanges Medicare and other domestic programs. 
</P>
<P>
	The vote was 57-43 -- largely along party lines -- in favor of the  
GOP plan. The 10-year measure includes broad-based tax relief as 
well as provisions designed to address the so-called marriage 
penalty and make it easier to accumulate retirement savings and pay 
for education. 
</P>
<P>
	Passage was followed by the beginning of efforts at forging a  
quick House-Senate compromise. Congressional GOP leaders hope to 
speed the final measure through both houses next week, although it 
won't be sent to Clinton until after Labor Day. 
</P>
<P>
	That would leave time for the GOP rank and file to trumpet the  
benefits of tax cuts during Congress' long August break. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want to cut taxes and the president wants to spend it,''  
Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., said of projected 
federal surpluses. ``That's what this fighting is all about. We are 
determined to give working Americans the tax relief they are 
entitled to.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton wasted little time renewing his oft-stated veto threat.  
``The Republican tax cut is so large it would undo our fiscal 
discipline and imperil our prosperity,'' he said in a written 
statement. ``It would crowd out our commitments to pay down the 
debt, to save Social Security and to strengthen and modernize 
Medicare with a long overdue prescription drug benefit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate measure includes a reduction from 15 percent to 14  
percent in the lowest personal income tax bracket, effective in 
2001. Beginning in 2006, it would gradually shift some income 
currently taxed at 28 percent into that lower bracket. 
</P>
<P>
	It also includes provisions to reduce the marriage penalty, in  
part by slowly raising the standard deduction for married couples 
to double the amount allowed for individuals. Individuals currently 
may claim $4,300, and couples $7,200. 
</P>
<P>
	Moments before final passage, the measure was amended to let  
investors exclude from taxes the first $1,000 in long-term capital 
gains. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the bill, more students would be allowed to deduct the  
interest on their education loans; limits on deductible 
contributions to individual retirement accounts would rise 
gradually to $5,000, and there would be liberalized tax incentives 
for individual and corporate donors to charities. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill also would create a new deduction for the cost of  
long-term care insurance, and raise the estate tax exemption -- 
already scheduled to increase to $1 million -- up to $1.5 million in 
2007. 
</P>
<P>
	Throughout three days of debate on the Senate floor, Republicans  
said their budget would set aside the vast bulk of projected 
surpluses for Social Security. The tax cuts, they stressed, would 
consume less than 24 cents of each dollar of predicted surpluses. 
</P>
<P>
	``It helps the family and it helps the country,'' said Sen.  
William V. Roth, R-Del., chairman of the Finance Committee and 
architect of the legislation. 
</P>
<P>
	But Democrats and the president contended the GOP bill would dip  
into Social Security surpluses beginning in 2005, and leave little 
or nothing for other domestic programs. They also said that by 
providing tax cuts based on economic forecasts that might not 
materialize, the Republicans were risking a return to the days of 
large federal deficits. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is another riverboat gamble with the American economy,''  
said Sen. Byron Dorgan, D-N.D., in an echo of the rhetoric used in 
the early 1980s when Republicans cut taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats countered with a smaller tax cut of $290 billion,  
which was rejected earlier in the week. Efforts to fashion a 
bipartisan compromise at $500 billion collapsed Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	A final compromise is still a possibility at year's end, but the  
immediate prospect is for a veto confrontation driven by competing 
readings of the electorate's wishes 15 months before the next 
elections. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans, who called their measure the Taxpayer Refund Act of  
1999, hope they can force Clinton to bend to their wishes on tax 
cuts, and say the president and other Democrats will pay a 
political price otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats, meanwhile, believe they can frame the debate as a  
choice between risky, overlarge tax cuts on one side, and the fate 
of Medicare and other politically popular programs on the other. 
</P>
<P>
	Throughout the three days of floor debate, both sides sought to  
shore up potential weaknesses in their position. For their part, 
Republicans parried Democratic claims about Medicare by pledging to 
address the issue of prescription drugs this fall. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats abandoned Clinton's initial approach of targeted tax  
relief in favor of broad-based tax cuts, although on a far smaller 
scale than the GOP wanted. 
</P>
<P>
	With an eye on the 2000 elections, when eight first-term  
Republican senators will seek new terms, Democrats forced a series 
of politically charged votes, including one on a proposal to reduce 
the tax cut to make room for prescription drug benefits for 
Medicare recipients. The amendment failed. 
</P>
<P>
	On final passage, the bill was supported by 52 Republicans, Sen.  
Bob Smith, I-N.H., and Democrats Mary Landrieu and John Breaux of 
Louisiana, Bob Kerrey of Nebraska and Robert Torricelli of New 
Jersey. In opposition, there were 43 Democrats and two Republicans, 
George Voinovich of Ohio and Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania. 
</P>
<P>
	At a news conference, Lott and House Speaker Dennis Hastert,  
R-Ill., outlined an ambitious schedule that calls for a compromise 
by Tuesday, with final votes in the two chambers by the end of next 
week. 
</P>
<P>
	There are numerous differences between the bills. One is a  
House-passed provision that calls for a 10 percent across-the-board 
income tax cut rather than the reduced income tax bracket the 
Senate approved. 
</P>
<P>
	Lott told reporters ``there's a lot of support'' among Senate  
Republicans for an across-the-board cut, adding, ``That is the 
fairest.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It will fall to Lott and Hastert to prod the chairmen of the  
tax-writing committees, Roth and Rep. Bill Archer, R-Texas, to 
avoid prolonged haggling that would slow the broader GOP political 
strategy.

<HEADLINE> Grapefruit Industry Rebounding </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAKELAND, Fla. (AP) -- Florida growers and processors are  
remaking the image of the grapefruit, long the poor stepchild of 
citrus, by touting its health benefits and improving the tangy 
taste of its juice. 
</P>
<P>
	The makeover has been a big success so far, helping the  
grapefruit industry's sagging demand rebound steadily in the last 
two years. 
</P>
<P>
	Growers are getting their best prices since the mid-1990s and  
more people are drinking the juice and eating fresh grapefruit. The 
demand has bounced back so sharply that citrus officials say there 
could be a shortage between now and the start of the next growing 
season in November. 
</P>
<P>
	The Harvard Business School plans to use the grapefruit's  
comeback as a case study of how to turn around a struggling 
agricultural commodity. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's rare for an industry to turn around this quickly,  
especially one that is based on a tree crop and is planted in the 
ground for so many years,'' said Harvard professor Ray Goldberg. 
</P>
<P>
	It's a stark contrast from recent years when growers left fruit  
on trees to rot, dumped excess fruit in pastures for cows to eat 
and yanked out thousands of trees as prices plunged to their lowest 
levels in 35 years. The industry's governing body, the Florida 
Citrus Commission, considered restricting the amount of grapefruit 
grown to help prop up prices. 
</P>
<P>
	Florida supplies about half of the grapefruit eaten in the world  
and more than three-fourths of the grapefruit consumed in the 
United States. Last season, growers produced an estimated 47 
million 85-pound boxes. 
</P>
<P>
	About 60 percent of Florida's grapefruit crop goes for juice.  
</P>
<P>
	As a result, as goes grapefruit juice consumption so goes the  
rest of industry. Efforts to turn around the moribund grapefruit 
sector focused on getting more people to drink the juice. 
</P>
<P>
	One change made by processors about three years ago was to  
increase the juice's natural sugar content, known as brix, by 
paying growers more for sweeter grapefruit. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've gone from putting out what was a tart and tangy product  
and made it more palatable to the consumer,'' said Vero Beach 
grower Dan Richey, a citrus commission member. ``We're putting out 
a much better juice product. Better flavor. Higher quality.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even more important was the marketing campaign by the Florida  
Department of Citrus and juice producers. 
</P>
<P>
	The department's $18 million ``Healthy Heart'' campaign was  
launched three years ago to tout grapefruit juice as free of fat 
and cholesterol. Television commercials, such as one showing a 
grapefruit beating like a heart, were aired around the country. 
Labels that said ``Certified Heart Healthy'' were placed on 
grapefruit juice cartons. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a powerful, powerful motivator for the consumer,'' said  
Daniel Santangelo, the citrus department's executive director. 
</P>
<P>
	Grapefruit juice sales now are at their highest levels in a  
decade, 58.5 million gallons, after bottoming out in 1995 at 45.8 
million gallons. 
</P>
<P>
	The number of grapefruit juice drinkers, however, still pales  
when compared with orange juice consumers because far fewer people 
like the taste of grapefruit. 
</P>
<P>
	So far this year, U.S. grocery stores have sold about $3.1  
billion of orange juice but only $247 million of grapefruit juice, 
according to the citrus department. 
</P>
<P>
	The department will focus its advertising campaign next season  
on women aged 35 to 54 with a household income of $50,000 or more. 
To that end, it plans a promotional tie-in with the Lifetime cable 
channel, whose audience is predominantly female.

<HEADLINE> PBS To Halt Donor List Exchanges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PASADENA, Calif. (AP) -- PBS stations will halt all exchanges of  
donor lists with partisan groups within a week, but when the 
political fallout for public broadcasting might end is difficult to 
predict, PBS president Ervin S. Duggan said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``By the end of this week, no station in America will be engaged  
in these practices,'' Duggan told a meeting of the Television 
Critics Association. 
</P>
<P>
	``It has delayed the (federal budget) authorization process and  
I don't know what the outcome will be,'' he said. ``I hope we can 
put it behind us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Of the 349 public television stations nationwide, PBS has  
admitted that as many as 30 appear to have engaged in list rentals 
or exchanges with political groups. 
</P>
<P>
	At issue is whether the list-swapping constitutes a violation of  
federal tax law. Tax experts have said that such exchanges would 
not be a violation as long as all political parties receives equal 
access to the lists. 
</P>
<P>
	The issue came to light in May, when Boston station WGBH-TV  
admitted giving a list of donors' names to the Democratic National 
Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Although he condemned the practice, Duggan said outside list  
brokers working for PBS stations swapped names with both Republican 
and Democratic groups. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is nonpolitical and nonpartisan behavior,'' Duggan said,  
noting that Bob Dole's 1996 presidential campaign and the 
conservative think tank Heritage Foundation were among those 
involved in swaps. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if the issue was being used by PBS critics as a weapon  
against public broadcasting, he replied carefully. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not going to deal with the motives of people on Capitol  
Hill or what might seem to some an effort to expand this issue 
beyond its proper limits,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal funding could be withheld from stations -- which get 25  
percent of their money from direct-mail appeals -- but that would be 
an overreaction because it was clear they intended to cooperate, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	In Washington, the House Commerce Committee was scheduled to  
consider funding for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting on 
July 14 but postponed the meeting after the mailing list 
disclosures. 
</P>
<P>
	Two lawmakers -- Rep. Billy Tauzin, R-La., chairman of the  
committee's telecommunications subcommittee, and Rep. Christopher 
Cox, R-Calif. -- have asked for investigations into the practice. 
</P>
<P>
	Tauzin, who was sponsoring the funding authorization bill for  
PBS, said he will reduce his funding proposal.

<HEADLINE> It's a Proud Day for Elder Geiberger  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PARK CITY, Utah (AP) -- No, Senior PGA Tour veteran Al Geiberger  
didn't win the Novell Utah Showdown. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, he sure looked and felt like the champion. That's because  
his son, Brent Geiberger, earned his first PGA Tour victory Sunday 
at the Greater Hartford Open. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's like winning, the adrenaline, the feeling,'' said the  
proud papa, flushed with excitement after coming off the 18th 
green. ``Of course, it's two different things. It's probably the 
only way I can still win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The elder Geiberger, winner of the 1966 PGA Championship and 10  
other tournaments, learned of his son's victory as he stood on the 
seventh tee box. He traded high fives with playing partners Howard 
Twitty and Jimmy Powell. 
</P>
<P>
	``I went down the fairway feeling like I had won the  
tournament,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Geiberger finished off the pace in Park City, shooting a  
final-round 71 that left him at 211, 5-under for the 54-hole 
tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	But in many ways, Al Geiberger looked like he had won, judging  
by the way he was cheered after news of Brent's victory was posted 
on the scoreboard and by the 45 minutes he spent in the press tent 
after his round. 
</P>
<P>
	Geiberger said he felt plenty of pressure, just not his own.  
</P>
<P>
	``It was tough,'' he said. ``Here I was out on the course  
playing my round and I'm pretending that I'm on the course there 
with Brent. I thought maybe I could take some of the pressure off 
him that way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Geiberger said his son had caddied for him several times on the  
Senior PGA Tour, and many of the other players in Utah offered him 
their congratulations. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm just very happy for Brent. Everybody that sees me out here  
is happy for us, too,'' Al Geiberger said. 
</P>
<P>
	Geiberger said Brent has always been a sound golfer, and it was  
just a matter of time before he collected his first victory as a 
professional. The times when Brent worked his dad's bag on the 
Senior Tour paid off. 
</P>
<P>
	``I always told him, 'You'll get just as many good breaks as  
bad, but if the bad breaks get you down, you'll never see the good 
ones,''' Al Geiberger said.

<HEADLINE> Giants' Williams Back After 2 Seasons </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- With the exception of the tinted protective  
visor on the front of his facemask, Brian Williams doesn't look 
different from any offensive lineman at the New York Giants' 
training camp. 
</P>
<P>
	The veteran center gets an equal number of plays and the same  
attention from the coaches. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams is different in one major way. After missing two  
seasons with what many felt was a career-ending injury to his right 
eye, the 33-year-old, who still has trouble seeing when he glances 
down, is attempting a comeback to regain the starting spot he held 
from 1994-96. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a miracle,'' said guard Ron Stone, who is Williams'  
roommate. ``He was pretty much done, but he wasn't ready to leave 
the game. He fought hard and he came back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After Williams missed the start of last season, few gave him a  
chance of returning. The double vision that resulted from being 
poked in the eye by teammate Bernard Holsey in the opening days of 
training camp in 1997 just wouldn't go away. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the Giants' 1989 first-round draft pick wasn't willing  
to give up. He underwent a second surgery in October and it worked. 
</P>
<P>
	``Last year, there was just nothing in my future that I saw that  
was very bright,'' Williams said. ``Being a football player was not 
even in my mind. I'm here (now) and it's time to get beat up again 
and get sore.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Giants really want Williams to succeed. Before he was hurt,  
he was viewed by the coaching staff as one of the NFL's top centers 
and the glue of the offensive line. Not only did he make all the 
line calls, he was the veteran influence who made five players work 
as a unit. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Jim Fassel was reminded of that on the opening day of camp  
Friday. The offensive coaches told him that Williams reminded the 
line ``no offsides'' on the first day of workouts. 
</P>
<P>
	There weren't any.  
</P>
<P>
	When free-agent center Emmett Zitelli seemed confused walking to  
a drill, there was Williams ready to explain things to him. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the centers of attention in the camp, Williams is doing  
his best to downplay his comeback. 
</P>
<P>
	``The only thing I am thinking about is just improving,''  
Williams said. ``I'm here and I'm glad and I guess I forget about 
everything that happened in the past. I just want to move on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Williams isn't taking anything for granted. Even though he has  
been penciled in as the starting center, he feels he has to prove 
himself again. 
</P>
<P>
	Lance Scott, who started the last two years, has been moved to  
left guard to take over the spot that opened when Greg Bishop 
signed with Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	``Barring another injury somewhere, I think he is the guy,'' new  
line coach Jim McNally said. ``I don't think he is going to 
disappoint us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Besides a few new techniques McNally has installed for the  
linemen, the most difficult thing for Williams to deal with has 
been the face shield. It keeps in the heat, fogs up and it makes it 
hard to breathe. 
</P>
<P>
	It's also never coming off, Williams said.  
</P>
<P>
	``I think the preseason will show a lot to me,'' Williams said.  
``You can only do so much in preseason. You have to play games and 
go against different people to see how your skills come back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Game one of the exhibition season should be interesting.  
Williams will get a chance to occasionally go against Minnesota's 
John Randle, one of the NFL's top defensive linemen. 
</P>
<P>
	That should tell a lot.

<HEADLINE> Broncos Heading to Australia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- The Denver Broncos don't profess to know much  
Australian history. They're familiar mostly with the basics. 
</P>
<P>
	``They have kangaroos,'' quarterback Bubby Brister said on the  
eve of his team's Sunday night flight to Sydney, Australia, where 
the Broncos will play the San Diego Chargers in an exhibition game. 
</P>
<P>
	``Kangaroos, koalas and the Crocodile Hunter,'' tight end  
Shannon Sharpe said. ``That's about my extent on Australia.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The country that is home to celebrities such as Nicole Kidman,  
Greg Norman, Paul ``Crocodile Dundee'' Hogan and Elle MacPherson 
will play host to its first NFL game, the American Bowl, on Sunday 
at Stadium Australia. 
</P>
<P>
	Getting there doesn't promise to be half the fun.  
</P>
<P>
	The Broncos were scheduled to leave Denver at 10 p.m. EDT and  
fly 2 1/2 hours to Los Angeles before embarking upon a 14 1/2-hour flight 
to Sydney. 
</P>
<P>
	Because of the 16-hour time change, Monday will not exist for  
the players, coaches and the accompanying entourage. They were 
scheduled to arrive in Australia on Tuesday morning. 
</P>
<P>
	It's an itinerary only Rip Van Winkle could love.  
</P>
<P>
	``They've told us when to fall asleep,'' defensive end Harald  
Hasselbach said. ``They'll come around and hand out sleeping pills 
if you want them, so by the time you get there, you're 
acclimated.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hasselbach, who has traveled to six continents, will be making  
his third trip to Australia. He was part of the Broncos' advanced 
scouting group that visited Sydney in April. 
</P>
<P>
	He also went Down Under in 1997 after winning a nationwide  
photography contest. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wanted to go because that was the only continent that I  
hadn't visited that's visitable,'' Hasselbach said. ``We loved it. 
Now that we're going again, I look at this as a tremendous 
opportunity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, how does a group of more than 100 people stay sane during  
17 hours in the air? 
</P>
<P>
	``Play cards, watch movies. That's about all you can do,''  
Sharpe said. ``I'll try to sleep, but I'm going to stay up for 
about 12 hours and aggravate everybody.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``He can probably do that,'' running back Terrell Davis said.  
``That's his trademark, being loud on the plane and waking 
everybody up. I hope they put my seat far from his.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Davis, the NFL's reigning MVP, figures to be one of the more  
talented players in Australia this week, but he won't be the most 
popular. 
</P>
<P>
	San Diego punter Darren Bennett is from Australia and the  
Broncos have agreed to sign punter Jon Ballantyne, an Australian 
who played in the NFL Europe League. 
</P>
<P>
	The pair, as well as curiosity, should help fill Stadium  
Australia, a 110,000-seat venue built for the 2000 Summer Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think they'll like it,'' linebacker Bill Romanowski said.  
``They're big on rugby over there. That's a tough game. You don't 
wear pads. I think they'll like the excitement and the hitting that 
football has to offer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Romanowski will be playing in his sixth American Bowl overall  
and his second with the Broncos, who have played exhibition games 
in London; Tokyo; Berlin; Barcelona, Spain; and Mexico City. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm kind of looking forward to it,'' coach Mike Shanahan said.  
``I'm not sure about the 16-hour flight of actually getting there. 
I think it will break up camp. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm sure there's a couple of vets that'll go out and get a  
chance to see the culture a little bit. I'd like them to do that. I 
think we can get a lot of work done and have them enjoy 
themselves.''

<HEADLINE> Unlikely Teen Faces Murder Charge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- As a 10-year-old boy, Jason Meeks pleaded with the  
governor to ``stop the violence.'' Now a teenager, he is facing a 
murder charge in the death of another teen. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1991, Meeks wrote to then-Gov. William Weld, asking him to  
help clean up the city's Roxbury neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
	``Make the people that are selling drugs go to school and put  
the bad people in jail,'' Meeks wrote. The letter prompted Weld to 
visit him at school in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	Meeks, now 18, was arrested Friday. He is accused of shooting  
another teenager, Tari Thomas, in May 1998, The Boston Globe 
reported Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas was shot once in the head, said Suffolk District Attorney  
Ralph C. Martin II. 
</P>
<P>
	In March, Meeks was arraigned on a gun possession charge and  
freed on $2,500 bail. The charge is still pending. 
</P>
<P>
	A relative of Meeks who requested anonymity told the Globe that  
Jason's mother, Shirley Hicks, died about two years ago. His 
mother's death deeply affected Jason, the relative said. 
</P>
<P>
	``His mother was his best friend,'' the relative said. ``He and  
she were real close. It still kind of bothers him just like anybody 
else who loses their mother.''

<HEADLINE> Pacers Deal A. Davis to Raptors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TORONTO (AP) -- The Raptors and Pacers finalized a trade Sunday  
that was agreed to a month earlier, with Toronto acquiring veteran 
power forward Antonio Davis from Indiana for 18-year-old Jonathan 
Bender. 
</P>
<P>
	The trade was made June 30 on the night of the NBA draft, when  
Bender was selected fifth overall, but league rules prevented it 
from being announced until Aug. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis, 30, spent the last six seasons with Pacers and helped the  
team reach the Eastern Conference finals four times. But he had a 
poor series this year in the Pacers' 4-2 loss to the New York 
Knicks and was deemed expendable as Indiana looked to get younger. 
</P>
<P>
	``Antonio Davis brings the veteran leadership, experience and  
toughness that will help us build on the progress we made as a team 
last year,'' Raptors general manager Glen Grunwald said. ``He is a 
terrific guy and will be a great addition to both our locker room 
and our community.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 6-foot-9, 230-pound forward averaged 8.9 points, 6.6  
rebounds and 25.5 minutes per game coming off the bench for Indiana 
last season. Davis could be particularly valuable to the Raptors if 
they are unable to re-sign power forward Charles Oakley, who is a 
free agent. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would love to start,'' Davis said. ``I'm willing to take on  
a lot of responsibility and once I get there and the coaches see 
how I fit in with the team, I hope they'll agree I'm capable of 
doing that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't expect to come to Toronto and have a starting position  
handed to me,'' he said. ``I have no problem with Charles Oakley 
coming back. I think a team needs three big, strong guys up 
front.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Presently, Oakley wants a contract averaging $8.5 million  
annually while Toronto has offered about $5.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
	As for rumors of a trade that would bring Penny Hardaway to  
Toronto and see Oakley and Tracy McGrady go to Orlando, Grunwald 
said it won't happen. 
</P>
<P>
	``We won't trade Tracy McGrady,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Bender was drafted out of Picayune High School in Mississippi.  
No high schooler had been picked that early since Minnesota took 
Kevin Garnett fifth overall in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pacers, who chose high schooler Al Harrington in the 1998  
draft, now have two teen-agers on their roster. Harrington is 19.

<HEADLINE> Democrats, GOP Split on Tax Package </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republicans determined to pass $792 billion in  
tax cuts met stiff opposition Sunday from Democrats and the White 
House making the case against cuts of any size. ``We are much 
further apart than the public understands,'' said Sen. Phil Gramm, 
R-Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	GOP and Democratic moderates still held out hope for an autumn  
compromise that would give Americans a tax cut over the next decade 
and preserve needed government spending programs. But one moderate, 
Sen. John Chafee, R-R.I., said there was a good chance neither side 
would get what it wanted. ``I think it's a shame.'' 
</P>
<P>
	GOP leaders in both chambers have given their deputies until the  
end of the week, when Congress departs for its August vacation, to 
settle differences in House and Senate tax cut bills and gain final 
passage of a bill President Clinton has pledged to veto. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill actually will not go to the president until September,  
giving supporters a chance to take their case to their constituents 
and avoid a White House veto ceremony when Congress is not around. 
</P>
<P>
	The bills passed by the House and Senate both total $792 billion  
in cuts over 10 years, but differ in details. 
</P>
<P>
	The House offers an across-the-board 10 percent tax cut while  
the Senate would lower the 15 percent tax bracket to 14 percent 
and, beginning in 2006, gradually shift some income currently taxed 
at 28 percent into the lower bracket. 
</P>
<P>
	The White House and most Democrats say the tax cuts would eat up  
almost all of the estimated $1 trillion in non-Social Security 
surpluses projected for the next decade. That would take away money 
needed for reforming Medicare, improving education and paying down 
the debt. 
</P>
<P>
	The White House said Sunday it would oppose any tax cut of more  
than $300 billion and preferred not to cut taxes at all. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would be better to do nothing and pay down $100 billion of  
our national debt than to sign a large and irresponsible tax cut 
that would signal to the world that the era of fiscal discipline in 
the United States is over,'' Gene Sperling, chairman of the 
National Economic Council, said on NBC's ``Meet the Press.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y., agreed that reducing the  
debt by not spending the Social Security surplus was already 
helping the economy. ``I'd like to suggest that we might be best 
off if we just quit now, went home and let nature take its 
course,'' he said. ``There is no need for a tax cut.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans responded that it was better to return the surplus  
to taxpayers than keep it in Washington where it will be spent. 
</P>
<P>
	``We view this as an opportunity to pare back the size of the  
government, to give taxpayers some of their own money back,'' Sen. 
Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said on NBC. 
</P>
<P>
	Gramm said on ABC's ``This Week'' there is a fundamental  
difference between Republicans who favor tax cuts and Democrats who 
want to ``start a new spending spree'' with the surplus -- a gulf 
not understood by the public. 
</P>
<P>
	``Only here in Washington could we not figure out what to do  
with $1 trillion in surplus,'' said Sen. John Breaux, D-La. Last 
week he led an unsuccessful effort by Senate moderates to push a 
$500 billion compromise plan. 
</P>
<P>
	Breaux, appearing on ABC and ``Fox News Sunday,'' proposed that  
in September, the White House and Congress negotiate a deal that 
would include both Medicare reform and tax cuts. 
</P>
<P>
	``Let's do Medicare first,'' Sperling said, repeating the White  
House position that extending the lives of Medicare and Social 
Security should come before tax cut discussions. 
</P>
<P>
	From the Senate Budget Committee chairman, Pete Domenici of New  
Mexico, came a proposal for a ``grand compromise'' that would 
include ``a very major'' tax cut. 
</P>
<P>
	Appearing on CNN's ``Late Edition,'' he said: ``If they don't  
want to start with that, then we will have gridlock on their terms, 
it will be their fault.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But getting a bill through Congress is far from certain.  
</P>
<P>
	Chafee, who voted for the Senate package despite his concerns  
that it was too big, said on NBC that he had told Senate Majority 
Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., ``Don't count on me,'' if the final 
bill has the House's across-the-board cuts. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics of the House bill says it gives a large share of the  
benefits to a small number of well-off taxpayers.

<HEADLINE> Smokejumpers at Front of Fire Fight </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MISSOULA, Mont. (AP) -- The first line of defense in battling  
U.S. forest fires are some 400 smokejumpers stationed at bases 
throughout the West. 
</P>
<P>
	Three-quarters of them work for the Forest Service and are based  
in Missoula and West Yellowstone, Mont.; Winthrop, Wash.; 
Grangeville and McCall, Idaho; Redmond, Ore.; and Redding, 
California. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bureau of Land Management employs the rest, who are based in  
Alaska and Idaho. The BLM began its own smokejumper program in 1958 
in Alaska, where the agency manages millions of acres. It was 
modeled on the Forest Service program, and the two agencies 
continue to cooperate in wildland firefighting. 
</P>
<P>
	Facts about smokejumpers:  
</P>
<P>
	--Candidates undergo rigorous paramilitary training and physical  
conditioning. Most rookie instruction focuses on parachuting, since 
recruits must already know how to fight forest fires. 
</P>
<P>
	--In an average five- or six-month fire season, a smokejumper can  
earn $14,000; a severe fire season, with overtime and hazard pay 
for jumping, could bring double that amount. 
</P>
<P>
	--By the end of the 1998 fire season, more than 250,000  
successful jumps had been logged. There have been three fatalities 
during descent. 
</P>
<P>
	--The smokejumper corps very nearly didn't get off the ground. In  
1935, when the Forest Service was experimenting with the idea, 
Montana regional forester Evan Kelley wrote to Washington asking to 
be rid of the program in his territory. ``All parachute jumpers are 
more or less crazy,'' Kelley wrote, ``just a little bit unbalanced, 
otherwise they wouldn't be engaged in such a hazardous 
undertaking.''

<HEADLINE> Suns Give Miller Second Chance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- Oliver Miller, who began his NBA career with  
Phoenix in 1992, returned to the team Sunday when the Suns signed 
him to a one-year contract. 
</P>
<P>
	Terms of the deal were not disclosed.  
</P>
<P>
	Miller, a forward and center, played only four games with  
Sacramento last season and spent most of the year on the injured 
list with back spasms. He was hampered by his weight, which was a 
reported 365 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
	The 29-year-old has since lost some 50 pounds and has looked  
impressive for the Suns' entry in the Rocky Mountain Review games 
for rookies and free agents. 
</P>
<P>
	Miller averaged 10 points, 8.3 rebounds, 3.3 blocked shots and  
1.3 steals in the first three games, including five blocks and 13 
rebounds last Thursday against Houston. 
</P>
<P>
	``Over the last two weeks, Oliver has shown great improvement in  
his physical conditioning and continues to display a desire for a 
fresh start both on and off the basketball floor,'' said Suns 
general manager Bryan Colangelo. ``This signing is the next step in 
Oliver's development.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Miller, who has also played for Detroit, Toronto and Dallas,  
said he wants to be down to 290 pounds by the time training camp 
starts Oct. 4. 
</P>
<P>
	He'd like to stay in the 295-300 range through the season.  
</P>
<P>
	``I've grown up. I've gone through a lot in these past five  
years,'' Miller told reporters last week. ``I'm just going to go 
out and show people that Oliver Miller means business. He still 
loves the game, and he's willing to do whatever is possible to 
win.''

<HEADLINE> Reds Happy To See Guzman Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- As the trading deadline approached, Greg  
Vaughn wasn't sure what the Cincinnati Reds were going to do. 
</P>
<P>
	Would they add a starting pitcher to their already over-budget  
roster to improve their playoff chances? Or would they trade away a 
high-priced veteran -- someone like him? 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't rule out anything,'' Vaughn said Sunday. ``When you're  
hitting .230, anything's possible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The rebuilding Reds made a statement with the way they wound up  
trading late Saturday night. By getting starter Juan Guzman from 
Baltimore for two minor leaguers, they showed they want to win now 
as well as later. 
</P>
<P>
	``The organization made a commitment because it had to take on  
some salary,'' Vaughn said. ``That tells us they're going to go as 
far as they can to help us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Reds got an undisclosed amount of cash from the Orioles to  
help pay the remainder of Guzman's $5.25 million salary. It's the 
second time they've gone over budget this year to get a player they 
wanted. 
</P>
<P>
	The acquisition of Vaughn in the offseason pushed the payroll to  
$33 million on opening day. The trade for Guzman adds a little 
more. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the Reds are rebuilding for 2003 when their new stadium  
opens, they've decided to put a little more money on the line to 
stay in contention now. 
</P>
<P>
	The players were delighted. Third baseman Aaron Boone walked up  
to managing executive John Allen in the clubhouse Sunday morning, 
shook his hand and pumped his fist. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's great, man,'' team captain Barry Larkin said. ``It  
addresses a need. Everybody in here has to feel very good about 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``When you have a chance to do it now, sometimes you've got to  
pull the strings and do it now. That's the way baseball is,'' 
pitcher Denny Neagle said. ``I was glad to see it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There was some apprehension in the clubhouse the last few days  
because teams had been asking for at least one of the Reds' young 
pitchers in a deal. General manager Jim Bowden refused and wound up 
sending minor leaguers B.J. Ryan and Jacobo Sequea to the Orioles 
for Guzman and cash. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am very impressed that we could get him without getting rid  
of anybody on the ballclub,'' catcher Eddie Taubensee said. ``It 
was a very intelligent move.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was a move the Reds felt they had to make stay in contention  
in the NL Central, where they've been in first or second place 
since June 17. Their rotation is a mess. 
</P>
<P>
	Steve Parris went on the disabled list Sunday with a strained  
right triceps. Pete Harnisch has been pitching with a sore shoulder 
that might need surgery at the end of the season. Steve Avery went 
on the disabled list a week ago. Ron Villone and Brett Tomko have 
been erratic. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the Reds' bullpen has the lowest earned run average in  
the major leagues, it has pitched the second-most innings in the 
majors because the starters are averaging only 5.5 innings. 
</P>
<P>
	This couldn't go on.  
</P>
<P>
	``Steve is on the disabled list and Pete's going out and giving  
us what he has, but you don't know if it's a situation you can go 
the whole year with,'' pitching coach Don Gullett said. ``And 
there's no logical choice at the minor league level.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Guzman was 5-9 with a 4.18 ERA in 21 starts for the Orioles.  
He's averaging 5.8 innings per start, was tied for the American 
League lead with 65 walks in 122 2-3 innings and will be a free 
agent after the season. 
</P>
<P>
	Guzman, 32, led the AL with a 2.93 ERA in 1996, but was on the  
disabled list six times from 1995-97 because of a muscle imbalance 
in his shoulder, a sore armpit, a strained chest muscle, an 
emergency appendectomy, a broken thumb and a strained shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
	``The first time I faced him, I was in awe of him,'' said center  
fielder Mike Cameron, who played for the Chicago White Sox. ``I 
faced him when he was well. He was nasty.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Given the state of the rotation, he doesn't have to be nasty to  
help the Reds. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're getting a pitcher who can give us innings we desperately  
need,'' Bowden said.

	White House Touts Workfare Success  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The White House said today that all 50 states  
have moved the required number of people from welfare to work, 
noting that 35 percent of the nation's welfare recipients held jobs 
in 1998. The president plans to promote those numbers on Tuesday at 
a welfare-to-work conference in Chicago, and use them to make the 
case for Congress to provide funding for services, such as child 
care, to aid the welfare-to-work transition.

meditation group that it was ready to ``smash any plot to split the 
nation.'' Defense Minister Chi Haotian repeated the government's

disease. But there is a long way to go to regain markets and try to 
re-establish confidence that British beef is safe, particularly in 
other European countries. The embargo crippled Britain's beef

Lewinsky suffered only scrapes and bruises today when her sport 
utility vehicle overturned on a freeway. Lewinsky, who was driving 
alone, reached over to the passenger seat to take something out of 
her purse, realized she was close to a motor home, veered away and 
then lost control of her Ford Explorer.

<HEADLINE> Lasorda: Dodgers an Embarrassment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Former Los Angeles Dodgers manager Tommy  
Lasorda says the team has been an unmotivated embarrassment this 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am very disappointed in the way we've played, I'm very  
disappointed in the effort that I've seen out there at times, and 
this just isn't acceptable for a Dodger ballclub,'' the Dodgers 
senior vice president was quoted as saying in Sunday's editions of 
the Los Angeles Times. 
</P>
<P>
	After Saturday's loss to Arizona, the last-place Dodgers were  
45-59, a season-high 14 games under .500 and 13 1/2 games out. 
</P>
<P>
	``These guys are playing for the names on the back of their  
uniforms, not for the names on the front Dodgers of their uniforms. 
You've heard people say there's no `I' in team? Well believe me, 
that's the way it has to be,'' Lasorda was quoted as saying. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've been an embarrassment because they're not focusing on  
the team, they're focusing on themselves. It's embarrassing because 
of what the Dodgers have always represented. It's embarrassing to 
our fans, and it should be an embarrassment to them. They should 
feel horrible because they're embarrassing the people who pay our 
salaries.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lasorda, traveling throughout the country on behalf of the  
organization, was especially critical of right fielder Raul 
Mondesi, saying he's had a bad attitude on and off the field. 
Mondesi has been struggling at the plate since June and he has 
infuriated Dodger officials by scoffing at team rules. 
</P>
<P>
	Mondesi was fined for missing a mandatory workout after the  
All-Star game, and he has been roundly criticized for sitting in 
the bullpen while the Dodgers were batting last Friday in the fifth 
inning of a nine-run loss to the Diamondbacks. 
</P>
<P>
	``I love Mondy, but I couldn't believe that he did that. That's  
not the Mondy I know, but Mondy has done a lot of things I'm 
disappointed with this year,'' Lasorda said. 
</P>
<P>
	``But what's even worse than that is that Mondy isn't displaying  
with the maturity we need from him. He isn't being the leader we 
need. I'm going to talk to him as soon as I get back to Los 
Angeles, because this has to stop.''

	Arafat Tries To Unite Palestinians  
</P>
<P>
	CAIRO, Egypt (AP) -- In a bid to unite Palestinian ranks before a  
new round of peace negotiations, PLO chairman leader Yasser Arafat 
met today with an extremist group that has opposed peace deals with 
Israel. Arafat held talks with representatives of the Popular Front 
for the Liberation of Palestine, whose leader had refused to meet 
with the chairman until he admits that the revocation of the 
Palestine National Charter was a mistake. The Palestinians in 
November formally rescinded parts of the charter, which called for 
the destruction of Israel.

	Blast Damages Serb Church in Kosovo

<P>
	PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- A large explosion damaged a Serbian  
Orthodox Church under construction in the heart of Kosovo's capital 
early today, the latest sign of ethnic hatred threatening the 
province's fragile stability. Tensions over the presence of Russian 
peacekeepers in Kosovo also have risen sharply after the Russians 
yesterday briefly detained a top commander of the Kosovo Liberation 
Army, chief of staff Agim Ceku. If such actions aren't stopped, 
ethnic Albanian rebel leader Hashim Thaci warned, ``We will defend 
our honor.'' No one was injured in the explosion at the Sveti Spasa 
church.

defended President Clinton as ``a very, very good man'' but said, 
``Yes, he has weaknesses, yes he needs to be more responsible, more 
disciplined,'' she told ``Talk'' magazine, according to a news

	Heat Wave Death Toll Reaches 150  
</P>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- While some parts of the nation saw temperatures  
drop yesterday, the death toll stemming from the recent heat wave 
continued to climb. The heat has been blamed for 150 deaths 
nationwide since July 19. An additional 20 deaths in Chicago may be 
heat-related and were under investigation, Mayor Richard Daley 
said, announcing the latest deaths from the heat wave that scorched 
much of the nation and produced New York City's hottest July on 
record.

	Heat May Have Had Role in Fatal Crash  
</P>
<P>
	COTTRELLVILLE TOWNSHIP, Mich. (AP) -- Federal investigators say  
heat may have been a factor in the plane crash that killed nine 
skydivers and a pilot yesterday. The National Transportation Safety 
Board says hot weather and high humidity can make takeoff more 
difficult. Yesterday was in the 80s and humid. The plane, a 
twin-engine Beech King Air 200, came down in a grassy field near 
Marine City Airport, about 40 miles north of Detroit, police said.

	Sosa Hits 40th in Cubs' 17-10 Win

	CHICAGO (AP) -- Sammy Sosa hit two homers to raise his major  
league-leading total to 40 as the Chicago Cubs beat the New York 
Mets 17-10 yesterday. It's the third time Sosa has reached 40 
homers in a season. He has three multihomer games this year and 36 
for his career. Dan Serafini (3-2) picked up the win with one 
inning of scoreless relief. Jason Isringhausen (1-3) took the loss, 
giving up five runs on five hits and three walks in three-plus 
innings. The Cubs scored a season-high seven runs in the first.

	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Mark McGwire hit his 496th career home run and  
J.D. Drew broke a sixth-inning tie with a solo shot as the St. 
Louis Cardinals beat the Colorado Rockies 6-5 last night. McGwire 
has 12 homers in his last 16 games and 39 overall, one behind major 
league leader Sammy Sosa of the Chicago Cubs. McGwire tied his own 
record of 219 homers in four consecutive seasons. He also did it 
from 1995-98. Cardinals starter Larry Luebbers lasted 5 2-3 innings 
and gave up four runs on eight hits.

<HEADLINE> 9 Deals As Trading Deadline Passes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Chuck Finley dreamed about going from last place to first in one  
day. The Philadelphia Phillies were hoping to add Andy Pettitte. 
The Tampa Bay Devil Rays appeared finally ready to join the trading 
frenzy. 
</P>
<P>
	As baseball's trade deadline passed Saturday at midnight EDT,  
the trades that weren't made were more notable than the ones that 
were. 
</P>
<P>
	Not that there weren't any trades. They just didn't involve the  
big names that were sent packing last July 31, like Randy Johnson, 
Todd Stottlemyre and Todd Zeile. 
</P>
<P>
	There were nine trades pulled off Saturday, including three by  
the New York Mets and two by the Oakland Athletics. 
</P>
<P>
	``We weren't supposed to be here in July,'' A's general manager  
Billy Beane said. ``Now we're trying to make our mark in this 
race.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Beane did that by overhauling his pitching staff in the last  
week in preparation for a wild-card run. The A's got Kevin Appier 
from the Kansas City Royals and also sent Billy Taylor to the New 
York Mets for pitchers Jason Isringhausen and Greg McMichael. 
</P>
<P>
	Those two deals came after trades that sent ace Kenny Rogers to  
the Mets and brought in starter Omar Olivares and infielder Randy 
Velarde from Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mets were the busiest team. Besides acquiring Taylor from  
Oakland, they got outfielder Darryl Hamilton and left-hander Chuck 
McElroy from Colorado and infielder Shawon Dunston from St. Louis 
for outfielder Brian McRae and three minor leaguers. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going for it,'' GM Steve Phillips said. ``Now's the  
time. You don't know how many times the opportunity will present 
itself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Perhaps the most surprising player not to change addresses was  
Finley. The noted Yankees killer, who is 16-9 against New York in 
his career, had been rumored all month to be ticketed to Cleveland 
-- or even the Yankees in a defensive move. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead of jumping into the middle of the pennant race, Finley  
stays in Anaheim, far behind Texas in the AL West. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's easy to get teased watching Cleveland and the Yankees and  
those teams swing away, but I tried to be realistic,'' Finley said. 
``I'm not disappointed that I'm still here, I'm not disappointed 
that I'm not there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Yankees had backed out by the end. And some even questioned  
whether they were really even involved at all, or were just in the 
talks to drive up the price for their October rival. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's the same thing that happened last year,'' Blue Jays GM  
Gord Ash said. ``New York's wants to do what Cleveland is thinking 
of doing and Cleveland wants to do what New York is thinking of 
doing but neither one wind up doing anything.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cleveland ended up doing nothing to bolster a pitching staff  
that is seventh-best in the AL. Despite efforts by Indians GM John 
Hart, Cleveland enters the stretch run without a starter whose ERA 
is under 4.00. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the right guy was out there for us, we would have done  
something, believe me,'' Hart said. ``We kept looking for that top 
line pitcher.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That pitcher wasn't out there. Appier and Baltimore's Juan  
Guzman -- who went to Cincinnati -- were the top starters to change 
teams. 
</P>
<P>
	The Yankees weren't shut out of the deadline dealing completely.  
They reacquired postseason hero Jim Leyritz from the San Diego 
Padres for a minor league pitcher. 
</P>
<P>
	The Yankees didn't deal Pettitte, who has struggled for most of  
the past year and drawn ire from owner George Steinbrenner for not 
being aggressive on the mound. 
</P>
<P>
	The Phillies were hoping to add Pettitte to their pitching  
staff. But the Yankees apparently cooled at the idea late Saturday 
when they couldn't acquire Tampa Bay reliever Roberto Hernandez 
despite talks into the final hour. 
</P>
<P>
	The Devil Rays, who also couldn't deal Rolando Arrojo or Fred  
McGriff, insisted on top prospect Alfonso Soriano being included in 
any deal with New York. Tampa Bay has made only three deals in more 
than 20 months since the expansion draft. 
</P>
<P>
	Trades still can be made, but players must first pass through  
waivers. That means any club can step in and block a potential 
deal. Teams might be a bit more wary to block a deal this year 
after watching San Diego get stuck with Randy Myers' hefty 
contract. 
</P>
<P>
	Three division leaders -- Cleveland, Texas and Houston -- made no  
moves heading into the deadline. That's not always a bad thing. 
Last year's pennant winners, the Yankees and Padres, both stood pat 
a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The Atlanta Braves, beset by injuries, did make a last-minute  
deal, acquiring left-hander Terry Mulholland and infielder Jose 
Hernandez from the Cubs for three minor leaguers. 
</P>
<P>
	The Braves, facing their first pennant race in six years,  
learned last week that they had lost catcher Javy Lopez and starter 
Odalis Perez for the season. That comes on top of earlier injuries 
to first baseman Andres Galarraga and closer Kerry Ligtenberg. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you lose offensive production like we have with Galarraga  
and Lopez, it's hurtful,'' GM John Schuerholz said. ``I don't mean 
to suggest that Hernandez will replace that. But it will give us 
another weapon offensively.''

<HEADLINE> Two Cubs Find Time's Up in Chicago </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Jose Hernandez's wife Melanie had set the  
microwave timer for 11 p.m. CDT Saturday night. If they did not 
receive a phone call before the timer went off, they were staying 
in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	The timer buzzed as the trading deadline struck. Less than two  
seconds later, their phone rang. 
</P>
<P>
	Hernandez and pitcher Terry Mulholland were dealt to the Atlanta  
Braves for 24-year-old left-hander Micah Bowie, 20-year-old 
right-hander Ruben Quevedo and a player to be named. Bowie will 
start Tuesday against the Montreal Expos. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think this was an opportunity to acquire two starting  
pitchers,'' Cubs general manager Ed Lynch said. ``It just so 
happens that they are young players. When you have a chance to 
acquire two young starting pitchers, you do it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mulholland and Hernandez packed their gear Sunday and said  
goodbye to their teammates. Hernandez's son, Jose Jr., was dressed 
in his Cubs jersey and wore a Cubs cap. 
</P>
<P>
	``My wife was already celebrating at home,'' Hernandez said of  
Melanie, who switched from cheers to tears at the news. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cubs had tried to keep Hernandez, 30, offering him a  
three-year deal, but Hernandez's agent wanted more money and four 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	``I got into an argument with my wife when I got home after  
yesterday's game,'' Hernandez said. ``I didn't know what to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And now?  
</P>
<P>
	``We've got to move along,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Mulholland, 36, is used to moving. He's played for five teams in  
t seven years, and bought moving boxes earlier in the week. 
</P>
<P>
	``Actually, it was a surprise,'' said Mulholland, who was 6-6  
with a 5.15 ERA. ``I really believed that after last year, we'd do 
bigger and better things. I still believe these guys are capable of 
playing well. It kind of twists in my gut that I'm not a part of 
it. On the plus side, I'll be with Atlanta. It's a mixed emotion 
thing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He planned on driving to Pittsburgh to join the Braves and  
report on Tuesday, dropping off personal belongings at his parents 
home in Uniontown, Pa., along the way. 
</P>
<P>
	Mulholland was scheduled to start Sunday but rookie Kyle  
Farnsworth started in his place. 
</P>
<P>
	Chicago recalled infielder Jose Nieves from Triple-A Iowa, and  
he will see the most playing time at shortstop, manager Jim 
Riggleman said. Nieves, 24, was batting .268 with 25 doubles, 11 
homers and 59 RBI and was a participant in the Triple-A All-Star 
game. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cubs also placed reliever Rick Aguilera on the disabled list  
because of a left calf strain and recalled left-handed reliever 
Steve Rain from Iowa. Rain pitched in 40 games for Double-A West 
Tenn earlier this year and was 3-1 with 24 saves and a 1.59 ERA.

<HEADLINE> Duval, Woods Play Made for TV Match  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	They didn't play against each other in the Masters or the  
Memorial. It hasn't happened at Pinehurst or The Players 
Championship. 
</P>
<P>
	They rarely play well in the same tournaments, which is why  
Tiger Woods and David Duval are never seen on the same television 
screen. 
</P>
<P>
	That's about to change, even if the only thing at stake are  
bragging rights and a difference of $700,000. 
</P>
<P>
	In the first golf event televised live in prime time by a  
network, Woods and Duval will play an 18-hole match Monday night at 
Sherwood Country Club in Thousand Oaks, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	Sure, the ``Showdown at Sherwood'' is a fabricated,  
made-for-television affair. The winner will earn $1.1 million from 
a $1.5 million purse (each donating $200,000 to charity) for a mere 
3 1/2 hours of work. Both would gladly trade the exhibition for the 
back nine at Augusta National or even Medinah next week in the PGA 
Championship. 
</P>
<P>
	ABC Sports, which will broadcast the event at 8 p.m. EDT, is  
banking on the fact that no one will care about anything other than 
watching the best two players in the world finally go head-to-head. 
</P>
<P>
	``It gives us an opportunity to kind of expose the game in a  
little different light, in a different time frame, on a different 
day and probably to a different crowd than would usually see the 
game,'' Duval said. 
</P>
<P>
	For those viewers who don't know a birdie from a bogey, they  
will see to players who share virtually nothing in common except 
their skill. 
</P>
<P>
	Woods is one of the most dynamic personalities in sports. He  
took golf to the front pages by winning the Masters in record 
fashion, becoming the youngest champion and the first one of color. 
His arrival is a big reason the PGA Tour landed a $136 million 
television contract, which made everyone around him richer. 
</P>
<P>
	``I might be a golf star, but I think Tiger is a star,'' Duval  
said. ``He transcends the game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Duval is everything Woods is not -- collected, methodical,  
emotionless. Behind those wraparound sunglasses are eyes that look 
lifeless, just like a shark before it tears into its prey. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's very calm, very levelheaded, and it comes out when he  
plays,'' Woods said. ``He is very methodical, very cool. He doesn't 
get excited, doesn't get frustrated. He just goes about his 
business.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Never mind that the event is essentially no different from  
Shell's Wonderful World of Golf matches, except for the live 
television. Never mind that the two richest players in golf are 
about to get even richer. Or that both players are represented by 
IMG, the sprawling sports agency that proposed the match. 
</P>
<P>
	What makes the match compelling is the fact they have clearly  
raised their game a notch above everyone else. They are the only 
players to be No. 1 in the world ranking this year, a position 
currently held by Woods. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think that they're arguably the two best players in the game  
today,'' Nicklaus said. ``I don't think there's any question about 
that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Duval stormed to top of the rankings by becoming the first  
player in 25 years to win four times before the Masters. That 
included the Bob Hope Classic, where he became the first player to 
shoot a 59 on a Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Woods came back strong. In six tournaments after his  
post-Masters break, he has won three times and not finished worse 
than seventh -- and that includes two majors, a third in the U.S. 
Open and a tie for seventh in the British Open. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, both players are looking more at the potential to draw an  
audience that doesn't typically watch golf. And both agree that any 
rivalry will have to be hatched in a major championship. 
</P>
<P>
	``People who think this will decide who is No. 1 or No. 2 are  
blowing it out of proportion,'' Duval said. ``It's a one-day match, 
18 holes, and that does not make it a rivalry.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For now, this is as close as it will get.  
</P>
<P>
	In 47 tournaments they have both played in their professional  
careers, Woods has finished ahead of Duval 27 times, with one tie. 
But they have never played together in a final round. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've come close, but it hasn't happened,'' Woods said.  
``Either he has played great and I haven't, or it's been the other 
way around. But it's going to happen. It's going to happen for sure 
at Sherwood.''

<HEADLINE> Clooney Likely Won't Return to 'ER' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LEXINGTON, Ky. (AP) -- George Clooney may not be going home  
again. 
</P>
<P>
	The actor says he most likely will not make a guest appearance  
this upcoming season at his old stomping grounds, the television 
drama ``ER.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``No one ever talked to me about it,'' Clooney said Saturday at  
an awards dinner in his native Kentucky. 
</P>
<P>
	Clooney, who left ``ER'' in the middle of last season to pursue  
movie interests, said he told show producers that he would come 
back to help with Julianna Margulies' exit from the show, but 
``they didn't really talk to me about it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Margulies has said she will leave the show after the 1999-2000  
season. 
</P>
<P>
	Clooney, a native of Augusta, and his family were the honorees  
Saturday at the A.B. ``Happy'' Chandler Foundation awards dinner. 
The foundation provides scholarships for Kentucky students. 
</P>
<P>
	Also at the dinner were vocalist Rosemary Clooney, George  
Clooney's aunt, and Nick Clooney, a host on the American Movie 
Classics channel and George Clooney's father.

<HEADLINE> Ripken Scratched From Orioles Lineup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- Cal Ripken, one homer away from 400 in his  
career, was scratched from the Baltimore Orioles' lineup against 
Seattle on Sunday because of stiffness in his back. 
</P>
<P>
	Ripken's status is day to day. Ripken, 32 hits short of 3,000,  
played in the first two games of the Mariners' series. 
</P>
<P>
	He went on the 15-day disabled list for the first time in his  
career April 20 with nerve irritation in his lower back. He was 
activated May 13. 
</P>
<P>
	He missed five games July 16-20 with a deep bone bruise in his  
right wrist that he suffered when he was hit by a pitch in a game 
against Montreal July 15. 
</P>
<P>
	Ripken is hitting .335 in 69 games this season with 15 home runs  
and 47 RBIs.

<HEADLINE> Packers' Brooks Misses Practice Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GREEN BAY, Wis. (AP) -- Wide receiver Robert Brooks was missing  
from practice again Sunday at the Green Bay Packers training camp 
amid speculation that he could be considering retirement. 
</P>
<P>
	After participating in the Packers' first full-squad workouts  
Friday, Brooks, 29, was given Saturday off by coach Ray Rhodes. 
</P>
<P>
	``My understanding is he's got a couple days to sit back and  
think about it and let Ray or Ron know what he's going to do,'' 
offensive coordinator Sherm Lewis said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rhodes said after the Sunday morning practice that he planned on  
speaking with Brooks later in the day. But Rhodes said later Sunday 
that did not happen and he now expected to talk to the player 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Brooks has said in the past he would retire if he was not  
completely healthy. 
</P>
<P>
	Brooks ``has certainly earned the opportunity to make up his own  
mind, and let's not speculate as to what it is he's going to do,'' 
Packers general manager Ron Wolf said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Let's let him make this decision rather than play this what-if  
game. And when he does, then we'll know what we're going to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wolf said that, if Brooks does retire, he believes the team can  
replace him with one of its younger receivers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have the utmost confidence in our ability to develop  
receivers,'' Wolf said. ``It's something we've always done here and 
I think we'll continue to do that. And we have some very talented 
people who are involved in that. So, I'm not concerned with that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With Brooks and holdout split end Antonio Freeman both absent  
Sunday morning, Bill Schroeder and Derrick Mayes worked with the 
first team while Corey Bradford and Jahine Arnold worked with the 
second team. 
</P>
<P>
	Schroeder, 28, is coming off his most productive pro season,  
with 31 receptions for 452 yards in 13 games. But his season ended 
when he broke his collarbone in three places Dec. 7 against Tampa 
Bay. 
</P>
<P>
	Mayes, 25, has been plagued by injuries since the Packers picked  
him in the second round of the 1996 draft. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradford, 23, who played just one year of college football at  
Jackson State, had three regular-season catches in eight games last 
year. But he did haul in a 47-yard bomb from quarterback Brett 
Favre in the Packers' playoff loss to San Francisco, and Lewis said 
during the offseason minicamps that Bradford could be the No. 3 
receiver this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Brooks underwent surgery during training camp last year to  
repair a herniated disc in his back. 
</P>
<P>
	He did not practice again until Oct. 11. He played in the first  
five regular-season games. 
</P>
<P>
	The injury bothered him throughout the season, and he finished  
with 31 catches for 420 yards and three touchdowns, having been 
inactive for four games late in the season. 
</P>
<P>
	Brooks had the same surgery in January amid talk that he might  
retire. He agreed to a $1.1 million pay cut in June, which the 
Packers said eased their salary-cap restriction.

<HEADLINE> Lease Says Penguins Will Stay in Rink </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- An agreement between new owner Mario Lemieux  
and investor Morris Belzberg assures the Pittsburgh Penguins will 
stay in their Southpointe practice rink. 
</P>
<P>
	Known as Iceoplex, the rink is owned by the same parent  
companies that formerly owned the bankrupt Penguins but was not 
included in Lemieux's reorganization of the team. 
</P>
<P>
	Lemieux's takeover is in the paperwork stage and is expected to  
be finalized in a week to 10 days. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the tentative agreement, the Penguins will continue to  
practice at the Washington County rink, which will be owned by 
Belzberg. The Penguins also will share in advertising revenues at 
the rink. 
</P>
<P>
	Belzberg was one of Howard Baldwin's original investors when  
Baldwin bought the Penguins in 1991. Belzberg also has joined 
Lemieux's group, contributing $2 million of the $50 million Lemieux 
will use to purchase the team.

<HEADLINE> Starr's Probers Asked About Sex </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Webster Hubbell, a longtime friend of  
President Clinton and Hillary Rodham Clinton, says investigators 
for Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr questioned him about the 
couple's sex lives as well as his own. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr's aides seemed especially interested in speculation  
involving Mrs. Clinton and White House lawyer Vincent Foster, who 
died of a gunshot wound in 1993, Hubbell said in an interview in 
this week's issue of The New Yorker magazine. 
</P>
<P>
	The questioning came as part of Starr's inquiry into the death,  
he said. Starr concurred with earlier findings that Foster 
committed suicide. 
</P>
<P>
	The article quoted a spokesperson for Starr's office as saying  
the investigators ``at all time asked relevant and proper 
questions. A professional and thorough suicide investigation always 
focuses on motives.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hubbell, a former associate attorney general, did not return a  
call from The Associated Press seeking comment. 
</P>
<P>
	He served 16 months in prison after pleading guilty to charges  
of bilking the Rose Law Firm in Little Rock, Ark., where Mrs. 
Clinton and Foster also worked, and its clients out of several 
hundred thousand dollars. 
</P>
<P>
	He now is on a year's probation for a negotiated guilty plea to  
tax evasion. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors ``wanted to know about Hillary's sex life. About the  
president's sex life, and mine, too. They specifically asked if 
Hillary and Vince had had an affair,'' The New Yorker article 
quoted him as saying. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was surprised. For one thing, I think it's awful personal.  
And I don't think it's anybody's business,'' he added. 
</P>
<P>
	Hubbell said prosecutors asked him detailed questions about  
whether he had extramarital sexual relationships with specific 
women, and he denied any affairs.

<HEADLINE> Malone Signs 4-Year, $66.5M Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Karl Malone will finish his career with  
the Utah Jazz, and he can finally ride his motorcycles without 
violating his contract. 
</P>
<P>
	The Jazz held a news conference Sunday to announce Malone had  
signed a new four-year deal. Malone's agent, Dwight Manley, said 
it's worth $66.5 million, with an immediate payment of the NBA 
maximum salary -- $14 million -- for next season. 
</P>
<P>
	``It means in a sense that what your mom told you was right,''  
said Malone, who turned 36 on July 24. ``If you work hard and 
dedicate yourself to something, you'll be rewarded.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Owner Larry Miller wasted no time retaining the two-time NBA  
MVP, perennial All-Star and two-time Dream Team member. 
</P>
<P>
	Malone signed Saturday at 10:01 p.m. MDT, just after midnight  
Sunday on the East coast as the NBA's one-month moratorium on free 
agent signings and trades came to an end. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have one goal now, and that one goal is to win the NBA  
championship,'' Malone said. ``It started 14 years ago. I'm not 
saying it's going to happen, but I'm going back to training right 
now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although Malone was a free agent, there was never a doubt he  
would stay in Utah, which drafted him with the 13th overall pick 
back in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
	``In five years, 10 years from now, whatever, what we'll look  
back on as Karl's greatness is what he did every night, year in and 
year out,'' Miller said, wiping away tears. ``It's impossible to 
measure what Karl has done for this franchise.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As recently as last November, Malone had vowed he wouldn't play  
for Utah again. Miller said that was ancient history. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's had ups and downs, like all family relationships do,''  
Miller said. ``Whatever label you put on it, I'd call it special, 
and I'd call Karl special.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Malone's new deal includes an exemption from a standard clause  
in NBA contracts that typically prohibits players from ``dangerous 
activities'' such as skydiving or riding motorcycles. 
</P>
<P>
	Malone's love of Harley Davidsons has been well publicized. For  
years, he has regularly driven his motorcycles to games at the 
Delta Center. The new contract grants him permission, in writing, 
to ride his bikes. 
</P>
<P>
	``No, he's not safe on it, but that's not the point,'' Miller  
said. ``When they asked for it in writing, I said 'Why? He's 
already been doing it for 14 years anyway.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Malone won his second MVP award last season despite averaging  
23.8 points, his lowest since his second year in the league. His 
rebounding average was down to 9.4, lowest since his rookie year in 
1986. 
</P>
<P>
	The Jazz were eliminated in the second round by the Portland  
Trail Blazers on a night when Malone shot only 3-of-16 from the 
field. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, ``The Mailman'' led Utah in scoring for the 13th straight  
year. Malone said he's ready for the expectations the new contract 
will bring. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've taken the good with the bad all my career,'' Malone said.  
``In this business, when you don't have the best game, that's 
probably going to come up again. That's how it's going to be for 
the next four years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Next, the Jazz will turn their attention to signing Utah's other  
key free agents: point guard John Stockton and shooting guards Jeff 
Hornacek and Shandon Anderson. 
</P>
<P>
	Miller hinted Stockton appears ready to sign a two-year deal and  
Hornacek is asking for a year-to-year contract. As with Malone, 
it's not likely Utah's big stars will get away. 
</P>
<P>
	Current negotiations center largely on Anderson, who has been  
courted by Seattle and San Antonio but might end up again with Utah 
because few teams can meet his asking price of more than $3 million 
for next season.

<HEADLINE> Chelsea Worked at Cattle Ranch </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LEWISTOWN, Mont. (AP) -- Chelsea Clinton worked part of the  
summer as an intern at a Montana cattle ranch, weighing bulls and 
sorting breeding pairs, before being called home early following 
the disappearance of John F. Kennedy Jr. 
</P>
<P>
	The N-Bar Ranch in central Montana has an intern program for  
college students interested in agriculture. Chelsea had taken a 
course in environmental economics at Stanford University. 
</P>
<P>
	``She was a delight,'' said ranch owner Susan Allred. ``She just  
pitched right in and worked with everyone else.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The president's daughter started in June, and plans had been for  
her to stay six weeks. But she was called back early to Washington 
by her father on July 17 -- the day Kennedy's plane disappeared. 
</P>
<P>
	Chelsea spent her time at the ranch helping move cattle, sorting  
pairs, weighing bulls, assisting with embryo transfers and 
collecting biocontrol insects.

<HEADLINE> Sheindlin Becoming TV Show Judge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Judge Judy's new competition is close to  
home. 
</P>
<P>
	New York State Supreme Court Judge Jerry Sheindlin, husband of  
TV's ``Judge Judy,'' has picked up the gavel for ``The People's 
Court,'' where the bench was most recently occupied by former New 
York Mayor Ed Koch. 
</P>
<P>
	Sheindlin said he asked his wife if she'd mind the competition.  
</P>
<P>
	``She is the one who told me I should do it,'' he said, adding  
he's not worried about going gavel-to-gavel against his popular 
wife. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think that behind every great woman there is a man,'' the  
65-year-old Sheindlin said, laughing. ``So I may be behind her now, 
but I also heard a rumor that behind every great man there is a 
woman. So we'll have to wait and see how it plays out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sheindlin said in Sunday's Los Angeles Times he wasn't ``quite  
retired'' from the Supreme Court when he was asked to do the third 
season of ``The People's Court.'' He began taping the series about 
six weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``I do about 10 cases a day and I work two days a week,'' he  
said.

<HEADLINE> Duval, Woods Play Made for TV Match  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	They didn't play against each other in the Masters or the  
Memorial. It hasn't happened at Pinehurst or The Players 
Championship. 
</P>
<P>
	They rarely play well in the same tournaments, which is why  
Tiger Woods and David Duval are never seen on the same television 
screen. 
</P>
<P>
	That's about to change, even if the only thing at stake are  
bragging rights and a difference of $700,000. 
</P>
<P>
	In the first golf event televised live in prime time by a  
network, Woods and Duval will play an 18-hole match Monday night at 
Sherwood Country Club in Thousand Oaks, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	Sure, the ``Showdown at Sherwood'' is a fabricated,  
made-for-television affair. The winner will earn $1.1 million from 
a $1.5 million purse (each donating $200,000 to charity) for a mere 
3 1/2 hours of work. Both would gladly trade the exhibition for the 
back nine at Augusta National or even Medinah next week in the PGA 
Championship. 
</P>
<P>
	ABC Sports, which will broadcast the event at 8 p.m. EDT, is  
banking on the fact that no one will care about anything other than 
watching the best two players in the world finally go head-to-head. 
</P>
<P>
	``It gives us an opportunity to kind of expose the game in a  
little different light, in a different time frame, on a different 
day and probably to a different crowd than would usually see the 
game,'' Duval said. 
</P>
<P>
	For those viewers who don't know a birdie from a bogey, they  
will see to players who share virtually nothing in common except 
their skill. 
</P>
<P>
	Woods is one of the most dynamic personalities in sports. He  
took golf to the front pages by winning the Masters in record 
fashion, becoming the youngest champion and the first one of color. 
His arrival is a big reason the PGA Tour landed a $136 million 
television contract, which made everyone around him richer. 
</P>
<P>
	``I might be a golf star, but I think Tiger is a star,'' Duval  
said. ``He transcends the game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Duval is everything Woods is not -- collected, methodical,  
emotionless. Behind those wraparound sunglasses are eyes that look 
lifeless, just like a shark before it tears into its prey. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's very calm, very levelheaded, and it comes out when he  
plays,'' Woods said. ``He is very methodical, very cool. He doesn't 
get excited, doesn't get frustrated. He just goes about his 
business.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Never mind that the event is essentially no different from  
Shell's Wonderful World of Golf matches, except for the live 
television. Never mind that the two richest players in golf are 
about to get even richer. Or that both players are represented by 
IMG, the sprawling sports agency that proposed the match. 
</P>
<P>
	What makes the match compelling is the fact they have clearly  
raised their game a notch above everyone else. They are the only 
players to be No. 1 in the world ranking this year, a position 
currently held by Woods. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think that they're arguably the two best players in the game  
today,'' Nicklaus said. ``I don't think there's any question about 
that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Duval stormed to top of the rankings by becoming the first  
player in 25 years to win four times before the Masters. That 
included the Bob Hope Classic, where he became the first player to 
shoot a 59 on a Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Woods came back strong. In six tournaments after his  
post-Masters break, he has won three times and not finished worse 
than seventh -- and that includes two majors, a third in the U.S. 
Open and a tie for seventh in the British Open. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, both players are looking more at the potential to draw an  
audience that doesn't typically watch golf. And both agree that any 
rivalry will have to be hatched in a major championship. 
</P>
<P>
	``People who think this will decide who is No. 1 or No. 2 are  
blowing it out of proportion,'' Duval said. ``It's a one-day match, 
18 holes, and that does not make it a rivalry.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For now, this is as close as it will get.  
</P>
<P>
	In 47 tournaments they have both played in their professional  
careers, Woods has finished ahead of Duval 27 times, with one tie. 
But they have never played together in a final round. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've come close, but it hasn't happened,'' Woods said.  
``Either he has played great and I haven't, or it's been the other 
way around. But it's going to happen. It's going to happen for sure 
at Sherwood.''

<HEADLINE> McLachlan Says Woodstock About Money </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Lilith Fair founder Sarah McLachlan knows what  
went wrong at Woodstock. 
</P>
<P>
	``When Woodstock was conceived, it was a beautiful thing,''  
McLachlan says in Sunday's New York Post. ``But what happened is it 
turned into this big, horrible commercial madness. It became all 
about making money.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Riots closed out the Woodstock concert festival this year, with  
fans burning and looting the stocks of vendors who sold water for 
as much as $4 a bottle. Things are different at Lilith Fair, the 
mostly female concert tour McLachlan founded three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	```Concerts with a conscience -- I like that,'' McLachlan said.  
``We've worked hard to create an environment for the artists and 
audience that is friendly, safe and socially conscious. We give 
room to all the nonprofit organizations that we support. 
</P>
<P>
	This is the last year for Lilith Fair. McLachlan says she and  
its other female performer want more free time so they can begin 
starting families.

<HEADLINE> Russia Gets First of IMF Payments </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- The first of seven installments of the  
International Monetary Fund's new loan to Russia is being 
transferred on Sunday to Russia's IMF account, the Interfax news 
agency reported. 
</P>
<P>
	The fund agreed last week to provide the $4.5 billion, 17-month  
stand-by credit to Russia. 
</P>
<P>
	The $640 million is to be used to pay off part of Russia's debt  
to the IMF. Russia was due to pay $808.4 million to the fund in 
July and $520.4 million in August, Interfax said.

<HEADLINE> Cancer Doesn't Slow Panthers' Coach </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SPARTANBURG, S.C. (AP) -- With temperatures near 100 degrees and  
no shade anywhere, the practice fields at training camp would seem 
like the last place a cancer patient would want to be. 
</P>
<P>
	Don Breaux, the tight ends coach of the Carolina Panthers,  
doesn't see it that way. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is what I love. This is where I belong,'' he said. ``I  
feel like I need to be here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He had colon cancer surgery in May and was at the team's  
minicamp three weeks later. These days, he has chemotherapy every 
Friday, and he's on the job full time. 
</P>
<P>
	While the trainers tend to overheated players and fans in the  
sweltering heat at Wofford College, Breaux refuses to complain. 
</P>
<P>
	Wearing gray shorts, a white T-shirt and a blue baseball cap to  
cover his thick crop of white hair, Breaux cheerfully ambles around 
the three-field complex. He jokes and laughs as he offers advice to 
his tight ends and coaxes other players. 
</P>
<P>
	``The man is incredible, just incredible. I don't know how else  
to describe it,'' tight end Luther Broughton said. ``We tell him 
all the time he should take a couple days off, but he just keeps 
smiling, saying he's OK and all that. 
</P>
<P>
	``It sure puts all this football stuff in perspective. You think  
you've got it tough in the heat and everything, and then you see 
him all happy and acting like he doesn't have a care in the 
world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this year, Breaux was about to have surgery on his  
chronically sore back. Then his blood tests showed something that 
drew concern. Further exams led to the discovery of a cancerous 
colon. 
</P>
<P>
	Breaux, 59, had cancer surgery after minicamp in May. By the  
next minicamp in June, he was back on the field. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's no problem, really. Some days I feel a little better than  
others, but they tell me I'm cured, so I believe them and just go 
on from there,'' he said. ``I have great faith. It's not like I had 
to manufacture faith just for this situation. I have great faith, 
and it's held me up to this point.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors say his best chance of keeping the cancer from returning  
is a precautionary round of chemotherapy. 
</P>
<P>
	In true Breaux fashion, he gets his chemotherapy on Fridays  
because those days are the lightest in his football workload. 
</P>
<P>
	``He doesn't want any sympathy,'' Broughton said. ``He just  
wants us to focus on camp and getting better. He just keeps saying 
he can handle it. I didn't even know he was getting chemo 
treatments until somebody else told me. That's how strong he is.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Breaux is still awaiting back surgery. As for the chemotherapy  
and its effects, he shrugs. 
</P>
<P>
	``I get a little bit nauseous from time to time, but that's it.  
And I can handle that,'' he said. ``Hey, when you're a football 
coach, this is what you enjoy doing, and that's why I'm out here.''

<HEADLINE> Don't Call U.S. Swimmers a 'B' Team </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WINNIPEG, Manitoba (AP) -- You can call the United States  
swimming team at the Pan American Games anything you want. Just 
don't call it a `B' team. 
</P>
<P>
	``I definitely dismiss that as hogwash,'' women's coach Pete  
Malone said. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of people classify us as a `B' team, but I think we'll  
have just as good times as our `A' team,'' Beth Botsford, a 1996 
Olympic gold medalist in the women's 100-meter backstroke and 400 
medley relay, said. ``That's why I don't consider this a `B' 
team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Technically, the Americans were split into three teams this  
year: the `A' team will compete in the Pan Pacific Games later this 
month in Sydney; the `B' team was designated for the Pan Am Games; 
and the `C' team competed recently in the World University Games at 
Palma de Mallorca, Spain. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of people on this team could be on the Pan Pacific  
team,'' Scott Tucker, a member of the men's Olympic gold 
medal-winning 400 freestyle relay team, said. ``A lot of people 
have improved since last summer when the teams were selected. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't consider this a `B' team at all.''  
</P>
<P>
	Neither does men's coach Gregg Troy.  
</P>
<P>
	``We've been termed a normally weaker team than we send to the  
Pan Am Games,'' he said. ``But this team is like the one we sent 
four years ago and that team did exceptionally well. It rose above 
its expectations. 
</P>
<P>
	``This team is not seeded well, but there's no need to take us  
lightly. We might be a little vulnerable, but I think the athletes 
will respond well to the challenge.'' 
</P>
<P>
	They certainly responded well in 1995 at Mar del Plata,  
Argentina, winning 23 individual medals, including eight golds, in 
13 men's events, plus all three relays. They also took 22 
individual medals, nine golds, in 13 women's events and won the 
three relays. 
</P>
<P>
	This time, the best men's hopes are Tucker in the 100 and 200  
freestyle, and in the 400 and 800 freestyle relays; Aaron Piersol, 
16, the youngest American ever to break two minutes in the 200 
backstroke; Sabir Muhammad, the team's biggest member at 6-foot-7 
and the American record holder in the 100 freestyle; and Mark 
Gangloff, 16, the team's youngest member, in the 200 breaststroke. 
</P>
<P>
	The top women's swimmers include Botsford, in the 100 and 200  
backstroke; Kaitlin Sandeno, the national champion in the 400 
individual medley, who will compete in the 400 and 800 freestyle; 
and Katie Yevak, the national champion in the 200 breaststroke. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't have a lot of athletes who have been tested  
internationally,'' Troy said. ``The Brazilians will be very good 
and the Canadians will be focused, because they are at home and 
it's a big chance for them to be successful. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a good chance we could dominate the total medals, but  
not dominate the gold medals.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Two of the golds are expected to go to Brazil's Gustavo Borges,  
the defending champion in the 100 and 200 freestyle. Another 
favorite from Brazil is Fernando Scherer, the 1996 Olympic bronze 
medalist in the 50 freestyle and the fifth-fastest swimmer ever. 
</P>
<P>
	The top Canadian is Curtis Myden, the Olympic bronze medalist in  
the 400 individual medley and the ninth-fastest ever. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're looking for people to stand up here,'' Troy said. ``This  
is a chance for our young swimmers to establish themselves for next 
year's Olympic trials.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tucker also sees this as an opportunity for the U.S. team to  
assert its vaunted power. 
</P>
<P>
	``Calling this a `B' team is more motivation for us,'' he said.  
``All we have to do is go out and prove how good we are. 
</P>
<P>
	``We haven't brought the `B' thing up as an issue. We don't  
think anything about it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Neither do the women.  
</P>
<P>
	``Since October we've only talked them about where we want to be  
in Sydney next year,'' Malone said. ``A lot of swimmers on this 
team are ahead of those on the `A' team. This is a long journey for 
them and it won't end until after the Olympic Games in Australia.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The six-day swimming competition begins Monday with finals in  
the women's 100 freestyle, 400 individual medley and 800 freestyle 
relay, and the men's 100 breaststroke and 200 freestyle.

<HEADLINE>  Bradley: Taiwan Should Temper Talk </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The United States must make clear that Taiwan  
should not expect U.S. aid if Taiwan's unilateral moves toward 
independence provoke a Chinese invasion, Democratic presidential 
candidate Bill Bradley said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley, speaking on NBC's ``Meet the Press,'' said the United  
States is committed to helping Taiwan against a Chinese military 
strike. But the United States ``should say to the Taiwanese 
government that if they take steps toward independence, they cannot 
count on us for any help.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley, who is challenging Vice President Al Gore for the  
Democratic nomination next year, said ``we would be there'' if 
China takes military action against Taiwan in the absence of a move 
toward independence. 
</P>
<P>
	Taiwan's president, Lee Teng-Hui, recently angered Beijing by  
suggesting he no longer supported the one-China policy under which 
Taiwan and China, separated after a 1949 civil war, ostensibly are 
committed to eventual reunification. 
</P>
<P>
	On the campaign front, Bradley said he was ``actually shocked  
that the Gore campaign attacked me so strongly'' after Bradley 
urged Democratic and Republican candidates for president to decline 
``soft money'' contributions -- the largely unregulated donations to 
political parties. 
</P>
<P>
	The Gore camp, in a letter, accused the former New Jersey  
senator of dropping the fight for campaign finance reform when he 
quit the Senate ``for private life and $2 million in special 
interest speaking and consulting fees.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley said it was ironic that a Republican presidential  
hopeful, Sen. John McCain of Arizona, was the only one to agree 
that candidates should refuse to accept soft money. McCain has been 
a leader in efforts to change campaign finance law.

<HEADLINE> Cuba Baseball Wins Olympic Berth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WINNIPEG, Manitoba (AP) -- Cuba won a return trip to the  
Olympics, beating a stubborn Canadian team and overcoming the 
distraction of a ninth-inning protester for a 3-2 victory Sunday in 
the Pan Am baseball semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cubans, Olympic champions in 1992 and 1996, will meet the  
United States or Mexico for the Pan Am gold medal Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	It was sweet revenge for the Cubans, who were rocked by  
preliminary-round losses to Canada, 8-1, and the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Omar Linares, regarded as his nation's best player, hit a  
two-out, three-run homer in the third inning. Jose Ibar pitched 5 
1-3 innings of strong relief before he lost concentration after 
retiring the first batter in the ninth. 
</P>
<P>
	That's when a man carrying a ``Human Right First'' sign came  
onto the field in front of the mound. Cuba's Yobal Duenas rushed 
out of the dugout with his country's flag and tried to wrap up the 
protester. 
</P>
<P>
	The man, wearing a shirt with ``Freedom'' written on the front,  
then ran behind the plate. Cuban catcher Ariel Pestano tried to 
stop the protester with his mask before the man ran in front of the 
Canadian dugout, where he was apparently hit by Cuban second 
baseman Juan Padilla and knocked down. Authorities then took the 
man away. 
</P>
<P>
	Ibar, apparently shaken, then gave up a single to Todd Betts,  
threw a wild pitch and walked Ryan Radmanovich before Luis Lazo 
came on to strike out the final two hitters. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this year when the Cubans beat the Baltimore Orioles in  
an exhibition at Camden Yards, a protester ran onto the field 
before he was tackled by a Cuban umpire. 
</P>
<P>
	Canadian left fielder Aaron Guiel, who would later strike out to  
end the game -- manager Ernie Whitt moments earlier protested he was 
hit with a pitch that was ruled a foul ball -- was in front of the 
dugout when the protester was trying to get away. 
</P>
<P>
	``The guy made us all look bad,'' Guiel said. ``But what is  
great about the U.S. and Canada is that you have the freedom to do 
that. I don't agree with what he did and I also don't agree with 
Cuba's politics, either.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When Canada beat Cuba 8-1 in the opening round, Guiel twice ran  
over Pestano at the plate. And then Sunday, he was nearly in the 
middle of another physical confrontation as the protester fled the 
angry Cubans. 
</P>
<P>
	``One of their coaches tried to throw a punch and another player  
tried to throw his mask at him. I had my bat in my hand and another 
guy was beside me,'' Guiel said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We just stood in between. It's a good thing for them they  
didn't show any aggression toward us. Then there would have been 
some real trouble.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``In a way I understand it. But basically those guys are  
brainwashed into thinking the way their country runs is the way it 
should be run. ...Unfortunately it was a little blemish on the 
game, a great game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The loss was a tough one for Canada, which had won all five of  
its games entering the semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
	``Probably the toughest loss I've ever had to take,'' Guiel  
said. ``We were one run, one blooper, one error away from 
qualifying for the Olympics.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Canadians took a 2-0 lead against starter Norge Vera on a  
wild pitch with runners at first and third in the second and a 
third-inning solo homer from Stubby Clapp. 
</P>
<P>
	Canadian starter Mike Meyers retired the first two batters in  
the third before Luis Ulacia and Isacc Martinez singled. Linares 
then drove a long homer to left. 
</P>
<P>
	Ibar relieved in the fourth and allowed only one hit into the  
ninth. 
</P>
<P>
	After Lazo got the final two outs, the Cubans swarmed their  
hefty relief pitcher and several players once again came running 
out of the dugout with their flag, taking a short celebratory jaunt 
up the left field line. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cubans did not comment after the game, but their actions  
made it clear how relieved they were to qualify for the gold medal 
game -- and for the Olympics.

<HEADLINE> Drug Test Takes Away Canada Medal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WINNIPEG, Manitoba (AP) -- Canada was stripped of its gold medal  
in roller hockey at the Pan Am Games Sunday, because its goaltender 
tested positive for banned substances. The gold now goes to the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Canadian goaltender Steve Vezina of Montreal tested positive for  
two stimulants and an anabolic steroid, games officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Argentina now gets the silver medal, while Brazil the bronze.  
This was the first time roller hockey was held in the Pan Am Games. 
</P>
<P>
	The positive test was the first drug scandal at the Winnipeg  
Games. 
</P>
<P>
	Mario Vazquez Rana, president of the Pan American Sports  
Organization, said the level of the substances found in Vezina's 
urine left no doubt that he had broken the rules. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a clear case of violation,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Canada beat the United States 7-6 Tuesday for the gold medal.  
</P>
<P>
	Roller hockey is one of six sports on the Pan Am program that is  
not an Olympic sport. 
</P>
<P>
	Vezina tested positive for ephedrine, a stimulant often used for  
hay fever, pseudoephrine and an anabolic steroid, Nandrolene. 
</P>
<P>
	Games officials dismissed the possibility that Vezina had taken  
the stimulants for medical purposes, saying that the concentrations 
were too high in his urine to indicate such usage. No amount of 
anabolic steroid is permitted. 
</P>
<P>
	The stimulants would allow an athlete to avoid fatigue, while  
the steroid would allow the buildup of muscle mass. 
</P>
<P>
	Vezina -- a distant relative of Canadian hockey great Georges  
Vezina -- for whom the NHL's annual award for the best goaltender is 
named.

<HEADLINE> Falcons' Chandler Still Throws Deep </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GREENVILLE, S.C. (AP) -- The anxiousness shows in his face.  
Clearly, Chris Chandler is a bit worried in the early days of 
training camp. 
</P>
<P>
	After answering his critics by taking the Atlanta Falcons to  
their first Super Bowl -- his, too, for that matter -- Chandler 
wonders if there's anyone to take advantage of his robust right 
arm. 
</P>
<P>
	``That is definitely an area of concern,'' the Falcons  
quarterback said. ``I like throwing deep balls. I like doing it a 
lot better when a guy has the ability to get deep.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chandler had his greatest season in 1998, throwing for 3,154  
yards and 25 touchdowns, but he faces a major obstacle if he's to 
duplicate those numbers. Tony Martin, the team's fastest receiver 
who caught 66 passes for 1,181 yards a year ago, was released in 
the offseason after being indicted on money laundering charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Now playing with his hometown Miami Dolphins, Martin goes on  
trial Monday morning in a south Florida courtroom. Chandler, 
meanwhile, returns to the practice field at Furman University, 
wondering what the verdict will be on the Falcons future. 
</P>
<P>
	``Tony had the knack of being able to get open deep,'' Chandler  
said. ``I have to deal with it like we're going to get it worked 
out. We still have 5 1/2 weeks until that first game. That what's 
we're grinding away at.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Terance Mathis had similar numbers to Martin -- 64 receptions,  
1,136 yards -- but he lacks the size and speed of his former running 
mate. The Falcons signed Chris Calloway, the Giants' leading 
receiver, but he's more of a possession-type receiver. 
</P>
<P>
	Tim Dwight has Martin-type speed but much work to do on running  
precise routes. Ditto for Ronnie Harris. Besides, those two have a 
grand total of 12 career receptions. 
</P>
<P>
	``With Tony on the field, we didn't see as much early-down  
blitzing,'' Chandler said. ``His ability to beat people deep was a 
threat that teams had to deal with. I think they defensed us 
differently because of that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	To make matters worse, 1,846-yard rusher Jamal Anderson is  
refusing to report to training camp unless he gets a new contract. 
For now, Chandler looks like a man alone, forced to carry an 
inordinate burden in the Falcons' offense. 
</P>
<P>
	``He certainly has the ability to do that,'' coach Dan Reeves  
said. ``I don't think the pressure would bother him if we have to 
rely more on the passing game to open up the running game. He knows 
the system we've got and he's comfortable with the system we've 
got.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Six months later, Chandler doesn't look back on the greatest  
season of his career. For now, his most vivid reminder is the 34-19 
loss to John Elway and the Denver Broncos in the Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe some day, if we don't get back there again and that's  
all the Super Bowl experience I get, I'll probably look back and 
maybe think it was pretty neat,'' he said. ``But right now, when 
we're in the middle of training camp and trying to get back there, 
there's no time for reflecting.''

<HEADLINE>  Volker Sets World Backstroke Record </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ISTANBUL, Turkey (AP) -- Germany's Sandra Volker broke her world  
record in the 50-meter backstroke at the European Swimming 
Championships on Sunday, and Pieter Van den Hoogenband of the 
Netherlands emerged as the new star of the meet. 
</P>
<P>
	Volker was first off the blocks to finish in 28.71 seconds and  
defeat Spain's Nina Jivanevskaia (29.02). Metka Sparavec of 
Slovenia got the bronze in 29.25. Volker broke her mark of 28.78 
last month in Monte Carlo. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know myself where I got the power from for this world  
record,'' Volker said. ``All the races seem to have drained me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Holland's Pieter Van den Hoogenband defeated world and European  
champion Alexander Popov of Russia, swimming the 50-meter freestyle 
in 22.06. The Russian left the pool with his first bronze medal, 
behind Italy's Lorenzo Vismara. Vismara was second in 22.21 while 
Popov clocked 22.32. 
</P>
<P>
	Hoogenband has been unbeatable so far, delivering fast  
performances in every one of the five events he has entered. 
Holland's disqualification in the 800 relay Saturday robbed him of 
the fastest relay leg of all time in 1:45.20. 
</P>
<P>
	Runaway record breaker Inge de Bruijn took her 50-meter  
freestyle race in 24.99. Therese Alshammar of Sweden was second in 
25.30 and Alison Sheppard of Britain was third in 25.33. 
</P>
<P>
	Marcel Wouda, another star in the new Dutch swimming powerhouse,  
goes for gold in the 400 medley. But he faces tough competition 
from Italy's Alessio Boggiatto, Spain's Frederik Hviid, and 
Germany's Jirka Letzin. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dutch pair of Kirsten Vlieghuis and Cara Geurts are favored  
in the 400-meter women's freestyle, with their main competition 
coming from Camelia Potec of Romania. 
</P>
<P>
	In the 200-meter women's butterfly, Denmark goes for its first  
medal with Mette Jacobsen, who swims against Katrin Jaeke of 
Germany and Spain's Maria Pelaez.

<HEADLINE>  Volker Sets World Backstroke Record </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ISTANBUL, Turkey (AP) -- Germany's Sandra Volker broke her world  
record in the 50-meter backstroke at the European Swimming 
Championships on Sunday, and Pieter Van den Hoogenband of the 
Netherlands emerged as the new star of the meet. 
</P>
<P>
	Volker was first off the blocks to finish in 28.71 seconds and  
defeat Spain's Nina Jivanevskaia (29.02). Metka Sparavec of 
Slovenia got the bronze in 29.25. Volker broke her mark of 28.78 
last month in Monte Carlo. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know myself where I got the power from for this world  
record,'' Volker said. ``All the races seem to have drained me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Holland's Pieter Van den Hoogenband defeated world and European  
champion Alexander Popov of Russia, swimming the 50-meter freestyle 
in 22.06. The Russian left the pool with his first bronze medal, 
behind Italy's Lorenzo Vismara. Vismara was second in 22.21 while 
Popov clocked 22.32. 
</P>
<P>
	Hoogenband has been unbeatable so far, delivering fast  
performances in every one of the five events he has entered. 
Holland's disqualification in the 800 relay Saturday robbed him of 
the fastest relay leg of all time in 1:45.20. 
</P>
<P>
	Runaway record breaker Inge de Bruijn took her 50-meter  
freestyle race in 24.99. Therese Alshammar of Sweden was second in 
25.30 and Alison Sheppard of Britain was third in 25.33. 
</P>
<P>
	Marcel Wouda, another star in the new Dutch swimming powerhouse,  
goes for gold in the 400 medley. But he faces tough competition 
from Italy's Alessio Boggiatto, Spain's Frederik Hviid, and 
Germany's Jirka Letzin. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dutch pair of Kirsten Vlieghuis and Cara Geurts are favored  
in the 400-meter women's freestyle, with their main competition 
coming from Camelia Potec of Romania. 
</P>
<P>
	In the 200-meter women's butterfly, Denmark goes for its first  
medal with Mette Jacobsen, who swims against Katrin Jaeke of 
Germany and Spain's Maria Pelaez. 
</P>
<P>
	The 11-day meet ends with the men and women's 400 medley relays.  
There also will be finals in women's 10-meter synchronized diving 
and the men's 3-meter springboard.

<HEADLINE> Japan Stocks Fall in Early Trading / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- The dollar declined against the yen early Monday,  
following through from last week's weakness. Japanese stocks fell 
following another decline on Wall Street. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 114.84 yen in early trading, down 0.42 yen  
from late Friday in Tokyo but unchanged from its late New York 
level Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average shed 110.86 points,  
or 0.62 percent, to 17,751.00 in the first 30 minutes of trading. 
On Friday, the average closed down 8.06 points, or 0.05 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency dealings, traders said the dollar's basic weakness  
remained unchanged. The greenback last traded in the 114-yen range 
in Tokyo on Feb. 15. 
</P>
<P>
	In New York on Friday, the dollar dropped to a five-month low of  
114.20 yen on worries over the general state of the U.S. economy. 
The Dow Jones industrial average slid for a second straight session 
Friday, losing 136.14 points, or 1.3 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The greenback has been weak against major currencies in recent  
weeks, including the yen and the euro, on fears of inflation in the 
United States and expectations of an economic recovery in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	Inflation fears have risen since the U.S. Labor Department said  
its Employment Cost Index rose 1.1 percent in the second quarter of 
this year, a larger-than-expected jump. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro was traded at 122.42 yen, down  
from 123.46 yen late Friday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	On the stock market, share prices opened lower amid concerns  
about the strong yen as well as the weakness on Wall Street last 
week. 
</P>
<P>
	A weaker dollar cuts into the overseas profits of Japanese  
companies when translated into yen. Despite some signs of an 
economic recovery, many Japanese companies are struggling to bail 
out of the country's worst economic slowdown in 50 years. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section was down 13.52 points, or 0.91 percent, to 1,465.41. 
The TOPIX closed down 11.20 points, or 0.76 percent, on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the benchmark No. 214 10-year Japanese government  
bond rose to 1.820 percent from Friday's finish of 1.7850 percent, 
driving its price down to 99.82 yen from 100.12 yen.

<TEXT>
<P>
	Companies must be alert for all threatening incidents, not just  
by problem employees, violence prevention researchers note. 
Nevertheless, some types of people are more likely to turn violent. 
According to author Lynne McClure, here are traits to look for: 
</P>
<P>
	-- Keeping away from others.  
</P>
<P>
	-- Failure to take responsibility for their actions.  
</P>
<P>
	-- Rigid and controlling behavior.

<P>
	-- Acting out anger, or seeing only their own point of view.  
</P>
<P>
	-- Talking one way and acting another.  
</P>

<HEADLINE> Lewinsky Injured in Car Accident </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	VENTURA, Calif. (AP) -- Monica Lewinsky suffered only scrapes and  
bruises Sunday when her sport utility vehicle overturned on a 
freeway, the California Highway Patrol said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Lewinsky, who was driving alone, reached over to the  
passenger seat to take something out of her purse, realized she was 
close to a motor home in the next lane, veered away and then lost 
control of her vehicle, said Bob Inman, a CHP dispatcher. 
</P>
<P>
	Her Ford Explorer crossed a dusty median strip on state Highway  
101 about five miles north of town and toppled on its side, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``She was awake and alert when paramedics arrived,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Lewinsky, 26, who lives in Los Angeles, was not cited for  
the accident and alcohol or drugs were not involved in the 1 p.m. 
crash, Inman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Lewinsky was transported to Community Memorial Hospital in  
Ventura, where she was treated and released, according to a nursing 
supervisor. 
</P>
<P>
	Her father and another person, who was not identified, came to  
the hospital to pick her up, the supervisor said. 
</P>
<P>
	It was unclear how fast the former White House intern was  
driving, where she was going or what she was trying to get out of 
the purse, he added. 
</P>
<P>
	Will Wood, a retired police officer from Santa Barbara, said he  
witnessed the accident. 
</P>
<P>
	``She missed our car by about 10 feet,'' Wood said, adding that  
he had to swerve to get out of the way. He and other motorists 
stopped to help, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I saw there was a girl in the front seat, and she was trying  
to get out of her safety belt. I didn't know who she was,'' Wood 
said. ``She said her name was Monica and we were using her name to 
calm her down, like 'It's okay, Monica.''' 
</P>
<P>
	He and another man pulled her out of the car, he said.  
</P>
<P>
	``She had a lot of cuts on her left arm and some of her blood  
got onto my hands,'' Wood said. ``But she never passed out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The southbound lane was closed for about 30 minutes while the  
vehicle was towed away.

<HEADLINE> Dolphins' Collins Rushes to Forefront </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT LAUDERDALE (AP) -- In a spirited intrasquad scrimmage that  
featured a melee, Dolphins rookie running back Cecil Collins 
vaulted to the forefront of Miami's overcrowded backfield. 
</P>
<P>
	Collins, the Dolphins fifth-round pick whose draft value dropped  
because of several off-field trangressions, rushed for 63 yards on 
13 carries, including a 40-yard touchdown on an off-tackle burst. 
</P>
<P>
	``Unfortunately, someone's got to start, but we're all competing  
for jobs,'' said Collins, who played in just six collegiate games 
at Louisiana State and McNeese State. ``But when it comes down to 
it, we're all teammates.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It didn't look that way early on in the controlled scrimmage at  
Lockhart Stadium -- the home of the MLS Fusion -- when defensive back 
Terrell Buckley took offense to a downfield block thrown by tight 
end Hunter Goodwin. The two came to blows and ignited a team melee. 
</P>
<P>
	Red-faced Dolphins coach Jimmy Johnson ran on the field to break  
it up and then read his troops the riot act during a team meeting 
in front of 15,684 fans. 
</P>
<P>
	``I could tolerate a little altercation during practice, but not  
like it,'' Johnson said. ``and not during a game or scrimmage when 
it will cost you 15 yards. I will not have it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Collins' performance was clearly the high point for the  
large crowd. 
</P>
<P>
	Collins, kicked out of both universities after being arrested  
for unlawful entry, battery and failing drug tests, was serenaded 
by fans with chants of ``Dies-el, Dies-el.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope everyone is for me,'' said Collins, 23. ``I'm just  
trying to help the team as much as I can and give 110 percent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While Collins isn't expected to displace incumbent starter Karim  
Abdul-Jabbar right away, he is fighting for a role in a backfield 
logjam that includes second-round pick J.J. Johnson, Giants castoff 
Tyrone Wheatley, speedy John Avery and versatile rookie fullback 
Rob Konrad. 
</P>
<P>
	Avery, expected to be the third-down back, had five catches for  
54 yards in the scrimmage. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson rushed for 15 yards on nine carries, while Abdul-Jabbar  
ripped off an impressive 31-yard run in a brief appearance. Juan 
Johnson, a free-agent running back out of Utah, gained 31 yards on 
five carries. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheatley did little to attract attention, amassing 18 yards on  
seven attempts. 
</P>
<P>
	Konrad, a 6-foot-3, 255-pounder, stood out, gaining 10 yards on  
two carries and catching four passes for 52 yards. 
</P>
<P>
	``Konrad's been solid all camp and will be a good player for  
us,'' Jimmy Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Dan Marino directed the first two of eight 12-play series,  
completing five of eight passes for 37 yards, including an 11-yard 
touchdown strike to Yatil Green. Green, the Dolphins' first-round 
pick in 1997 who has yet to play a down in a regular season NFL 
game after sustaining two major knee injuries, had two catches for 
17 yards.

<HEADLINE> Normal Rainfall Won't Break Drought </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Good news: The weatherman expects normal  
rainfall in August. 
</P>
<P>
	Bad news: That won't even start to relieve the drought in much  
of the country. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need a couple of feet of water to get out of this. That's a  
couple of tropical storms,'' D. James Baker, administrator of the 
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Baker, appearing on CBS' ``Face the Nation,'' said the drought  
in the Northeast is the worst in 30 years and the second-worst of 
the century. 
</P>
<P>
	``Droughts take a long time to set up, and they take a long time  
to get rid of,'' Baker said. 
</P>
<P>
	``And in fact, even if we go back to normal rainfall for August,  
which is what we expect to have, it's not going to give up for a 
long time. In some parts of the country, it may go through the 
winter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On the same program, Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman said the  
ground is as dry in the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast as it has been 
since the Great Depression. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite that regional crisis, Glickman said, people in most  
places should expect no serious increases in food prices or supply. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ironically, the heartland of America ... Texas, Oklahoma,  
Kansas, Nebraska, Iowa, all through the middle -- they're doing 
pretty well now in terms of rainfall,'' Glickman said. ``That means 
that this drought and heat wave probably won't have any kind of 
dramatic effect on food prices or shortages.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There could be problems, however, in supplies of fresh produce  
in Northeastern cities, the secretary said. In parts of the region, 
he said, rainfall is 50 percent to 80 percent below normal.

<HEADLINE> Patch Could Alter Aneurysm Surgery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- George Huffman had a time bomb in his abdomen:  
A weak bulging spot on the largest blood vessel in his body that, 
if it broke, would cause almost instantly fatal internal bleeding. 
</P>
<P>
	Surgery to patch that artery, the aorta, is among the most  
grueling operations known -- the entire abdomen is sliced open and 
delicate organs moved aside just to reach the problem spot. Surgery 
kills up to 10 percent of patients, and even those who do well can 
require months of recuperation. 
</P>
<P>
	Hoping to avoid traumatic surgery, Huffman volunteered to have  
an experimental patch, as thick as his index finger, threaded up 
his body through an artery in his leg. It worked. The Hickory, 
N.C., lawyer spent just one night in the hospital, and a week later 
was back at work. 
</P>
<P>
	Thousands of Americans with abdominal aortic aneurysms soon may  
get to opt for Huffman's easier therapy. 
</P>
<P>
	The first minimally invasive treatments, competing surgical  
devices made by Guidant Corp. and Medtronic Inc., are awaiting 
final Food and Drug Administration review after government advisers 
last month recommended their approval. 
</P>
<P>
	They will not be for everyone -- indeed, FDA's advisers worried  
the new devices may be dangerous for certain women -- and surgeons 
need careful training in the extremely difficult procedure. 
</P>
<P>
	But some surgeons say the devices could revolutionize care,  
particularly for elderly patients who could not survive regular 
surgery and today have no options. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's really a quantum leap in terms of therapy,'' said Dr.  
David Deaton of East Carolina University, who helped test Guidant's 
device. ``This technique is in its infancy and it's already clearly 
better, for the right patient.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors estimate that 1.5 million older Americans have abdominal  
aortic aneurysms, called ``AAAs.'' But because AAAs often cause no 
symptoms until the lifethreatening day they break, only about 
200,000 patients are aware of the problem. 
</P>
<P>
	The aorta is the largest blood vessel, like a river running from  
the heart to the groin with tributaries that branch off carrying 
blood around the body. 
</P>
<P>
	An aneurysm is a weak bulge in the aorta's wall. As blood pounds  
past, the pressure can cause that balloon-like spot to burst -- 
killing 15,000 Americans a year. 
</P>
<P>
	Aneurysms big enough to risk bursting require surgery to patch  
them. 
</P>
<P>
	The experimental alternative to that grueling operation: slice  
an opening into an artery in the groin; thread the aortic patch up 
that artery until it meets the aorta; then push the patch to the 
aneurysm spot. 
</P>
<P>
	The patch must extend like a sleeve inside the aorta, providing  
a new path so blood does not continue to pressure the weakened 
aorta wall. 
</P>
<P>
	Guidant's patch, Ancure, has little metal hooks that grab onto a  
healthy section of aorta to form that sleeve. 
</P>
<P>
	Medtronic's AneuRx is a stent, a metal scaffolding that opens up  
until it has expanded against the aortic walls enough to hold the 
patch in place. 
</P>
<P>
	In clinical trials of about 800 patients, the companies found  
the devices successfully repaired over 90 percent of AAAs, cut in 
half surgical side effects and sent patients home from the hospital 
in two to three days instead of six to nine. 
</P>
<P>
	But it was not risk-free. Even though fewer women than men get  
AAAs, FDA's advisers said women actually fared worse with the 
experimental procedure. 
</P>
<P>
	The problem is size, Deaton said: Often doctors did not realize  
in advance that many women's arteries were too small for the 
procedure. Efforts are being made to better choose women patients, 
and women whose arteries are big enough do fine, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Also troubling was that some patches leaked. It is unclear how  
risky that is -- how often that leak would build up enough to 
rupture, said FDA cardiologist Dr. John Stuhlmuller. 
</P>
<P>
	Leaks can be retreated, something required for 4.5 percent of  
patients, said Dr. Christopher Zarins of Stanford University, who 
tested Medtronic's device.	   But, ``with surgery, there's a very clear, upfront risk'' of 
complications or death in the operating room, Stuhlmuller said. 
``With the devices, the upfront morbidity and mortality is clearly 
lower. What's uncertain is the long-term risk.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Regardless of that uncertainty, ``patients love it,'' Zarins  
said of the new procedure. ``They're elderly, they don't want to 
have a big operation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The FDA's advisers concluded the key is choosing the right  
patient -- someone whose risks from open surgery outweighs that 
long-term uncertainty. 
</P>
<P>
	Also key is surgeon training.  
</P>
<P>
	``This is clearly the hardest endovascular procedure I've ever  
been exposed to,'' Deaton said, comparing it to building a model 
ship inside a bottle. But ``if you pick the right patient, things 
go quite well.''

<HEADLINE> Chiefs' QB Grbac Must Prove Himself </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- Nobody understands better than Elvis  
Grbac what a critical year this is for Elvis Grbac. 
</P>
<P>
	No longer a kid, the Kansas City Chiefs quarterback is closing  
in on the sunny side of 30. In his seventh year in the NFL, the 
talented young guy with all the bright promise stands on the brink 
of becoming a discarded, unfulfilled veteran. 
</P>
<P>
	Failing for a third straight year to stay healthy and productive  
for an entire season could prove ruinous to any future he might 
envision with the Chiefs, who would probably look elsewhere for the 
starting quarterback they thought they were getting from San 
Francisco in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll be 29 in two weeks,'' Grbac said. ``I think I'm at the  
point where I feel comfortable in this system. I feel comfortable 
with this organization and the players I have around me. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's time to just go out and start winning games on a  
consistent basis. I think this is the year I should do that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Since coming to Kansas City, injuries have been the biggest  
problem for the 6-foot-5 Cleveland native. A fractured left 
clavicle cost him six games in 1997, but still he was 8-2 in 10 
starts for a 13-3 team and the Chiefs were encouraged. 
</P>
<P>
	But last season was a total disaster. He was benched because of  
injury and poor play and caught most of the blame for a miserable 
7-9 campaign that kept Kansas City out of the playoffs for the 
second time in three years. 
</P>
<P>
	Late in the season, as his confidence vanished and popular  
backup Rich Gannon proved more productive, Grbac was even booed by 
the Arrowhead Stadium crowd. 
</P>
<P>
	Damaging his standing even more, he publicly criticized his  
teammates and drew fire from all sides following a 20-13 loss to 
Pittsburgh in a Monday night debacle. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, with Gannon gone to Oakland as a free agent and 42-year-old  
Warren Moon providing backup, Grbac goes into this season carrying 
the tattered image of a chronic underachiever and injury-prone 
loser. 
</P>
<P>
	And the pressure to perform is greater than ever.  
</P>
<P>
	``Yeah, I'd like to improve my image and do the things that  
every quarterback does. But the most important thing is winning 
games,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Last year was such a disappointment. I've just got to stay  
healthy and compete and get this team ready for the season. My 
image will be changed by the way we play, and the way we win games. 
We have to win at all costs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Chiefs cannot be blamed for hanging with Grbac. At times,  
both in San Francisco and Kansas City, he has flashed great 
promise. He has a strong arm and runs remarkably well for a man his 
size. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am as committed to Elvis as I am to any player on this  
team,'' said first-year coach Gunther Cunningham, who was promoted 
from defensive coordinator after Marty Schottenheimer resigned. 
</P>
<P>
	But everyone knows there's a limit to the organization's  
patience. 
</P>
<P>
	``The last two years have been disappointing for myself and,  
last year, for the entire team,' Grbac said. ``Every year you go 
through the league you're going to learn something. It's been a 
good learning process for me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``But I'm getting tired of it. I just want to start winning  
games.''

<HEADLINE> White House Touts Welfare Changes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Bolstering its claim that welfare overhaul is  
a success, the Clinton administration says one-third of the people 
on public assistance held jobs or prepared for them during 1998, 
with the required number moving off the aid rolls in all 50 states. 
</P>
<P>
	Administration officials say the proportion of welfare  
recipients who are working is four times higher than when President 
Clinton took office in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	Nationally, the percentage of welfare recipients with jobs rose  
from 7 percent in 1992 to 27 percent last year. The rest fulfilled 
their requirements by seeking work, or pursuing education or 
training. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton plans to promote those numbers Tuesday at a  
welfare-to-work conference in Chicago, and use them to make the 
case for Congress to provide money for services, such as child 
care, to help people make the transition. 
</P>
<P>
	According to figures released Sunday by the White House, Oregon  
had the highest employment rate, with 98.2 percent of welfare 
recipients working at least 20 hours a week during 1998. Montana 
was second with 78.3 percent, followed by Wisconsin with 64 
percent, Iowa with 56.9 percent and Wyoming with 55.3 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The lowest rates were reported in Maryland and South Carolina,  
each with 12.7 percent; North Carolina with 14.5 percent, New 
Mexico with 15.9 percent, Pennsylvania with 19.3 percent and 
Arkansas with 19.4 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The welfare law requires that 30 percent of families receiving  
aid have one parent who holds at least a part-time job. In 41 
states, 75 percent of two-parent families are required to have both 
parents working. 
</P>
<P>
	The two-parent work rates were lagging in 1998, the  
administration said. Of those 41 states, only 28 met the work 
requirements. 
</P>
<P>
	The figures represented the first full year of data since  
Clinton signed the welfare law in 1996. Not all states were 
required to report welfare-to-work statistics in 1997, and most 
that did offered data only for the last quarter of that year. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration reported last December that the required 25  
percent of welfare recipients were working in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	States that fail to meet the work requirements are subject to  
financial penalties, even though shrinking welfare rolls have 
caused $4 billion in federal welfare funds to go unclaimed at the 
Treasury Department. 
</P>
<P>
	However, if a state's welfare caseload has dropped by 25 percent  
since 1995, then its welfare-to-work requirement also is reduced by 
25 percentage points, meaning only 5 percent of recipients must 
hold jobs.

<HEADLINE> Insurance Cos. Merge in $1.2B Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Real estate services company Fidelity National  
Financial Inc. said Sunday it is buying larger rival Chicago Title 
Corp. for about $1.2 billion, or $52 a share, in about equal 
amounts of cash and stock. 
</P>
<P>
	The purchase more than doubles the size of Fidelity National  
Financial to about 1,000 offices throughout the country. The 
combined company will retain the name Fidelity National Financial, 
but will be run separately, First National said in a news release. 
</P>
<P>
	Based on 1998 combined revenue of about $3.2 billion, Fidelity  
National said the combined company will be the largest title 
insurance company in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	The $52 a share offer represents a 42 percent premium over  
Chicago Title's closing price Thursday, the day before talks 
between the two companies were announced. 
</P>
<P>
	The cash and stock balance will be adjusted so Chicago Title  
stockholders will receive more than 50 percent of the outstanding 
stock of the new company, Fidelity National said. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal, is expected to be completed by the end of March, will  
help Fidelity National, the nation's No. 5 title insurance company, 
expand its commercial insurance business. 
</P>
<P>
	Chicago Title, the nation's No. 3 title insurer, is a holding  
company for a group of insurance companies that provide title 
insurance, property valuation and other services for real estate 
transactions involving financial institutions, insurers and 
companies buying commerical properties. The group writes about 
one-fifth of all title insurance policies in the U.S. 
</P>
<P>
	``The addition of Chicago Title's operations, products and  
skills ... will result in the creation of a preeminent competitor 
in the title insurance industry,'' William P. Foley II, Fidelity's 
chairman and chief executive officer, said in a news release. 
</P>
<P>
	``The new company will also be a premier player in the rapidly  
growing area for real estate information services, accommodating 
customers that may desire 'one-stop-shopping' for all of their 
service needs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of Fidelity National closed Friday at $17.43 3/4, down 6 1/4  
cents, on the New York Stock Exchange. Chicago Title's shares were 
up 16.5 percent, or $6.06 1/4, at $42.75, also on the Big Board. 
</P>
<P>
	Fidelity National said the acquisition would add to its earnings  
per share by a ``high single digit to low double digit'' amount 
during the first year. 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement, which has been approved by the boards of both  
companies, is subject to approval by both companies shareholders.

<HEADLINE> US 92, Dominican Republic 80 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WINNIPEG, Manitoba (AP) -- Nothing like a little morning run to  
work out the frustrations from the night before. 
</P>
<P>
	Hours after suffering its worst loss ever in women's basketball  
at the Pan American Games, the United States awoke early Sunday and 
beat the Dominican Republic 92-80 to clinch a berth in the medal 
round. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think any basketball team when you lose by 30 points the  
game before, you want to come out and reprove yourself that you're 
not that bad,'' U.S. guard Michelle Marciniak said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The only thing we wanted to do was push the ball up and down  
the floor and get into the flow of a basketball game and just 
play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. men also played, meeting Brazil later Sunday.  
</P>
<P>
	The women (2-1), who lost to Cuba 95-64 on Saturday night, got  
their running game going for the first time in the tournament, 
resulting in a succession of layups and easy baskets inside. 
</P>
<P>
	Only two U.S. baskets came from outside 10 feet -- a pair of  
3-pointers by Marciniak, who scored 16 points. Lynn Pride, driving 
the baseline at will, led the Americans with 20 points and 11 
rebounds, Danielle McCulley scored 11 and Edwina Brown 10. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm excited to see us score that much,'' U.S. coach Nell  
Fortner said. ``Our transition game was working today and we took 
it at them. And that was one of our goals. Don't settle for 
pull-ups, take it to the hole. We didn't think they could guard 
us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The only problem for the Americans was that for much of the  
game, they couldn't guard Teresa Duran, who led all scorers with 33 
points. 
</P>
<P>
	Duran's 3-pointer drew the Dominican Republic (0-3) to 75-68  
with 9:52 remaining. But she made only two more baskets and the her 
team never got that close again as the taller Americans continued 
to pound away inside. 
</P>
<P>
	Pride, the most athletic of the U.S. players, was only 6-for-18  
in the first two games. She made a number of nice moves, but 
couldn't get the shots to fall. Sunday, she finished those moves, 
making six of her first eight shots and finishing 8-for-16. 
</P>
<P>
	``We tried to work with Lynn on making the easy play,'' Fortner  
said. ``Sometimes she makes the shot harder than it actually is. Go 
up and make the easy shot, just turn and shoot the ball. She really 
concentrated on that today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pride, who'll be a senior at Kansas, said it was all in her  
head. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just had a whole different attitude this game,'' she said.  
``It was a big game and I knew I had to come out mentally prepared. 
It was just go up, because they really couldn't match up with us in 
the post area.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brazil (3-0), Canada (2-1) and Cuba (2-1) also made the  
semifinals. The final two days of preliminary play will determine 
the seedings. 
</P>
<P>
	The Americans play Brazil on Monday and Canada on Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> Fla. Plans No Agent-Player Changes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WINTER HAVEN, Fla. (AP) -- Florida coach Steve Spurrier plans no  
changes in the way his program monitors player activity with 
agents, despite a troubled stretch during which five of his former 
players were accused of making improper contact. 
</P>
<P>
	``It will have no effect at all,'' Spurrier said Sunday,  
speaking during the media's annual gathering with the state's 
college coaches. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm very disappointed these players made a bad choice,'' he  
said. ``It's a bad choice they've got to live with now. It's 
unfortunate to them. But it's no reflection on the school.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Thus far, the NCAA and Southeastern Conference seem to agree.  
Neither appears ready to sanction Florida after three players -- 
Jevon Kearse, Johnny Rutledge and Reggie McGrew -- gave sworn 
affidavits admitting to taking improper payments from sports agent 
Tank Black's company. 
</P>
<P>
	Another two players, Tim Beauchamp and Dock Pollard, were  
accused of improper contact with a runner for another agent and 
were dismissed before the Orange Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	None of the players are still at Florida.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's unfortunate,'' Spurrier said. ``Because those guys did a  
good job as players, but they made bad choices as people. It was a 
very bad choice they didn't have to make.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Spurrier, athletic director Jeremy Foley and other officials at  
Florida have harped on the fact that they consistently remind 
players that taking money from agents is not allowed. 
</P>
<P>
	Florida State coach Bobby Bowden, who had an agent problem  
earlier in the decade, said his school takes similar measures but 
insists the problem comes down to one, simple issue. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's pure honesty,'' Bowden said. ``If the agents were honest,  
we'd have no problems. It comes down to honesty from the agents and 
from the players. It's the ones that won't abide by the rules that 
are killing us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bowden said it's easy to figure out why problems persist at  
schools like Florida and Florida State. 
</P>
<P>
	``You notice how some schools don't have as many problems with  
agents, because they've got no players,'' he said. ``So, they make 
a living in Florida. It's obvious that you'll see more of them here 
than at a school that doesn't have a pro prospect.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Spurrier doesn't feel there are any additional precautions that  
can be taken, either at Florida or on a national level, to prevent 
runners from infiltrating campuses and luring some players into 
taking money. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a free country,'' he said. ``Players know the rules and  
they can abide by them, or they can break them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If they do so at Florida, they face being excommunicated from  
their school. It's an action Spurrier hopes has a profound effect 
on Kearse, Rutledge and McGrew, three of the most talented 
defenders in school history. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this summer, the coach said none of those players are  
allowed to associate with Gator football anymore.

<HEADLINE> Victory Gallop Wins Whitney Handicap </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SARATOGA SPRINGS, N.Y. (AP) -- Victory Gallop outdueled Behrens  
by a nose Sunday to win the 72nd running of the $600,000, Grade I 
Whitney Handicap at Saratoga. 
</P>
<P>
	It was 12 lengths back to the third-place finisher, Catienus, as  
Victory Gallop and Behrens dominated the field. 
</P>
<P>
	The order of finish was completed by Sir Bear, Testafly, Nite  
Dreamer, Social Charter and Connecting Terms. 
</P>
<P>
	Jerry Bailey rode his second Whitney winner in the last three  
years. He also guided Will's Way to victory in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	For Behrens, it was another heart-breaking loss at Saratoga. Two  
years ago, he was edged by Deputy Commander in the Travers. 
</P>
<P>
	Victory Gallop trailed the field through the first six furlongs,  
allowing the early speedsters Social Charter, Testafly and Nite 
Dreamer to set the pace. Connecting Terms, Victory Gallop's 
entrymate who was supposed to be part of the early scenario, never 
got closer than fourth. 
</P>
<P>
	Midway on the far turn, Victory Gallop accelerated rapidly to  
join the leaders. By the time Victory Gallop entered the stretch, 
Behrens had rallied wide as well and had gained the lead. 
</P>
<P>
	Passing the eighth-pole, the two were on even terms, with  
Victory Gallop enjoying momentum that seemed likely to carry him 
past Behrens to a decisive victory. But Behrens dug in and the two 
battled evenly in the final yards with Victory Gallop emerging the 
winner by the narrowest of margins. 
</P>
<P>
	Victory Gallop carried co-highweight of 123 and Bailey 1 1/8 miles  
in 1:48.66 on the fast track to earn $360,000 for Prestonwood Farm 
with his third win in four starts this year. The colt by 
Cryptoclearance for the Mr. Prospector mare, Victorious Lil, now 
boasts career earnings of $3,505,895.00. The winning entry returned 
$3.80, $2.30 and $2.10. 
</P>
<P>
	Behrens paid $2.40 and $2.10, and Catienus was $2.10 to show.

<HEADLINE> Couple Just Missed Fateful Flight </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COTTRELLVILLE TOWNSHIP, Mich. (AP) -- Skydivers Bob and Caroline  
Johnson were running late and just missed joining their fellow 
parachutists aboard a weekend flight that crashed, killing 10. 
</P>
<P>
	The couple, hosting relatives from Florida, showed up late for  
their skydiving appointment at Marine City Airport. They had 
planned to be on Saturday's first flight of the 1967 Beech King Air 
65A-90 -- which veered sharply shortly after takeoff and plummeted 
into a hayfield, exploding into a ball of fire. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a very sad day,'' Bob Johnson, of Rochester Hills, told  
The Detroit News for a report Sunday. ``It's the weekend when we 
all take off from everything else and come out and enjoy each 
other's company and be thankful for all the times we've had. 
</P>
<P>
	``We all know the risk, and it's something we expect. It's  
better than sitting home on the couch, scared of life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Federal investigators planned to remain at the scene for three  
to five days, then return to Washington, D.C., to continue to 
review evidence. A determination of the crash's cause could take as 
long as six months. 
</P>
<P>
	It appeared the plane had been properly loaded, an issue that is  
often to blame for small plane crashes, said Frank Black, a 
spokesman for the National Transportation Safety Board. 
</P>
<P>
	Paul Myks, an experienced commercial pilot who had logged more  
than 9,000 hours of flight time, had prepared a manifest listing 
the weight of each jumper and piece of equipment, and appeared to 
have balanced the weight properly, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The plane did not carry a flight data recorder and was not  
required to do so, Black said. 
</P>
<P>
	The skydivers were part of a group called the Parahawks, who  
flew out of the airport about 40 miles north of Detroit. All those 
who died were veteran skydivers. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the U.S. Parachute Association, 32 people died  
while skydiving last year, one for every 100,000 jumps, The Detroit 
News reported.

<HEADLINE> NBA Roundup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Just one minute after the NBA's one-month moratorium on trades  
and free agent signings elapsed, Karl Malone signed a four-year 
extension with the Utah Jazz. 
</P>
<P>
	Antonio Davis was officially traded and Keith Van Horn, Jamie  
Feick, Eric Snow and George Lynch re-signed with their old teams. 
</P>
<P>
	Otherwise, though, Sunday was relatively quiet as July's  
moratorium on dealmaking gave way to an August that will eventually 
feature a flurry of deals. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought things would be busier today, but I guess I was  
wrong,'' Toronto general manager Glen Grunwald said. 
</P>
<P>
	Like many GMs, Grunwald was waiting to see what Orlando would do  
with Penny Hardaway. Many people around the league felt a 
resolution of the Hardaway situation would open the floodgates to 
further free agent signings and trades. 
</P>
<P>
	Hardaway spent the weekend in Phoenix meeting with Suns  
officials, who would like to acquire him in a sign-and-trade deal. 
The Lakers, Raptors and Trail Blazers were believed to be the other 
teams with the best chances of acquiring the three-time All-Star. 
</P>
<P>
	``Penny continues to visit teams and we continue to field phone  
calls,'' Magic general manager John Gabriel said. ``Penny has to 
make a decision, and one team has to step up. I doubt it will be 
resolved within 48 hours.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Malone signed his new four-year, $66.5 million contract just one  
minute after the moratorium expired. He appeared with teary-eyed 
Jazz owner Larry Miller at a news conference Sunday to announce the 
deal. 
</P>
<P>
	``It means in a sense that what your mom told you was right,''  
said Malone, who turned 36 on July 24. ``If you work hard and 
dedicate yourself to something, you'll be rewarded. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have one goal now, and that one goal is to win the NBA  
championship,'' Malone said. ``It started 14 years ago. I'm not 
saying it's going to happen, but I'm going back to training right 
now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Utah still must re-sign free agents John Stockton, Jeff Hornacek  
and Shandon Anderson. Stockton and Hornacek are virtual certainties 
to return to the Jazz, while Anderson is listening to offers from 
Seattle, San Antonio and Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
	The Jazz also were interested in forward Jamie Feick, who opted  
instead to return to the New Jersey Nets. Terms of Feick's deal 
were not immediately known, although Van Horn signed an extension 
worth roughly $73 million over six years. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was an automatic, quite frankly,'' Nets general manager  
John Nash said. ``We said from the beginning, there was no mystery 
about the fact that Keith is one of our more important players, and 
so from the first opportunity we had to talk to him and his 
representatives, we wanted to do everything in our power to 
maintain his services.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Davis was traded from Indiana to Toronto in a deal that was  
agreed to over a month ago. The Pacers get 18-year-old Jonathan 
Bender, the fifth overall pick in the NBA draft. 
</P>
<P>
	The 6-foot-9, 230-pound Davis averaged 8.9 points, 6.6 rebounds  
and 25.5 minutes per game coming off the bench for Indiana last 
season. Davis could be particularly valuable to the Raptors if they 
are unable to re-sign power forward Charles Oakley, who is a free 
agent. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's really nothing to report other than the fact we're  
still talking to Toronto,'' said Charles Grantham, one of Oakley's 
representatives. ``Once the gates open, depending on some of the 
interested teams, a sign-and-trade deal could take place.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 76ers didn't want to risk losing Lynch, their starting small  
forward, or Snow, who took over the point guard duties from Allen 
Iverson in the lockout-shortened 1999 season and was voted the 
league's most improved player. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our priority has been to keep our family intact,'' 76ers  
general manager Billy King said. ``Keeping Eric and George is a big 
part of that. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm just glad now it is official and I'm happy we were able to  
keep George and Eric part of our group. We're happy with what we've 
done, but our job's not finished.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In other free agent news:  
</P>
<P>
	-- Vin Baker planned to speak with Seattle SuperSonics officials  
Sunday night. His agent, Aaron Goodwin, said it remains a 
likelihood that Baker will return to Seattle for seven years and 
$83 million. ``I think we'll know by tomorrow what's going to 
happen,'' Goodwin said. The sides disagree on how much of Baker's 
salary should be tied to a weight clause. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Jermaine O'Neal was miffed at the Portland Trail Blazers'  
first offer, which was believed to be less than $30 million over 
seven years. He has drawn interest from several teams, including 
the suddenly youthful Pacers. ``Every team understands I'm a year 
or two away from being an All-Star,'' he told The Oregonian. ``I 
want my contract to reflect that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	-- Terrell Brandon was approached by the Raptors, who remain in  
need of a point guard and have enough salary cap room to offer $55 
million over six years. The Timberwolves have already offered 
Brandon a larger sum, and his agent, Bill Duffy, said the chances 
of his client remaining in Minnesota are ``very, very strong.'' 
</P>
<P>
	-- The Boston Celtics signed rookie free agent Adrian Griffin,  
one of their top summer league players.

<HEADLINE> Dodgers' Mondesi Snaps Out of Funk </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Sharply criticized by former manager Tommy  
Lasorda and upset by recent trade rumors, Raul Mondesi snapped out 
of his funk Sunday, one day after resting to clear his head. 
</P>
<P>
	Lasorda had singled Mondesi out when he criticized Dodgers  
players in a story in Sunday's editions of the Los Angeles Times. 
Now the club's senior vice president, Lasorda criticized Mondesi 
for his attitude and for sitting in the bullpen in Phoenix during a 
game against the Diamondbacks on July 23. 
</P>
<P>
	``When was the last time you saw Mondy get a hit to right  
field?'' Lasorda said. ``What's even worse is that Mondy isn't 
displaying the maturity we need from him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mondesi not only had two hits to the right side of the infield  
Sunday, he also showed enough self-control not to get into a public 
debate with Lasorda. 
</P>
<P>
	Although visibly upset, Mondesi declined to comment on Lasorda's  
remarks or his performance in what was only the Dodgers' third 
victory in their last 13 games. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't have anything to say about Lasorda or anything else,''  
Mondesi said. ``I just don't want to talk right now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mondesi had also been mentioned in several rumors leading up to  
Saturday's trading deadline. Manager Davey Johnson said he felt 
Mondesi was upset by the rumors, so he gave him a day off Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mondesi's going to be fine,'' Johnson said. ``It was good to  
see him come back like this. I'd been talking to him over the last 
week about being a little too home run conscious. I talked to him 
about being the kind of hitter we need him to be. He'll snap out of 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mondesi is making $8.5 million this season. He has two years and  
$20.5 million on his contract over 2000 and 2001, plus two options 
years for a total of $24 million. His struggles this season gave 
given rise to regular rumors that the Dodgers would like to get rid 
of his salary. 
</P>
<P>
	``I guess he was upset with some of the (trade) stuff that's  
been in the newspapers,'' Johnson said. ``Some of the stuff in the 
paper about him going someplace else got him a little confused, so 
I gave him the day off. He'll get back on track.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier, Mondesi said he wouldn't be all that surprised to be  
traded. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't mind if they trade me. What am I going to do, cry?''  
he said. ``It may have a different name on the front of the shirt, 
but it would still be the same bats and balls. They traded Mike 
Piazza and Hideo Nomo. They were rookies of the year, too. Maybe 
I'm next.''

<HEADLINE> Gun Control Advocates Regroup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Last spring's Colorado school massacre gave gun  
control advocates much to further their agenda. They had a villain: 
the TEC-DC-9, a banned, cheap semiautomatic pistol favored by drug 
dealers. They had a regulatory problem: lax sales rules at gun 
shows. 
</P>
<P>
	But Mark O. Barton's shooting spree last week in Atlanta, which  
took nine lives, is another story. 
</P>
<P>
	Half the nation's police officers carry the 9 mm Glock-19  
semiautomatic pistol assembled a dozen miles from the brokerage 
firms where Barton killed six of his victims. His other weapon, a 
Colt .45 pistol, is the gun Tom Hanks aims at a tank in the final 
scene of ``Saving Private Ryan'' and the gun Sgt. Alvin C. York 
used to single-handedly capture 132 Germans during World War I. 
</P>
<P>
	While the Atlanta killings have energized gun control advocates,  
they provide few clear examples of the narrow issues gun control 
advocates have recently pursued. 
</P>
<P>
	Child safety locks wouldn't have deterred Barton. Police had no  
evidence he got his guns illegally, or bought them at a gun show 
where sales rules are lax. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest slayings strip the debate to the most basic question  
-- should handguns be banned entirely, said Josh Sugarman, executive 
director of the Washington-based Violence Policy Center. 
</P>
<P>
	``Until we start talking about banning handguns in this country,  
this is America's future. We'll have shootings in schools, in 
office buildings, in malls,'' Sugarman said. ``In America, wherever 
you're amid a large concentration of people, you're at risk.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, a group of Colorado students stood at the site of the  
May massacre at Columbine High School to renew their call for 
stronger curbs on handgun ownership. 
</P>
<P>
	Atlanta and Columbine ``taught us all that violence can happen  
everywhere, not just in the inner city, not just by hardened 
criminals,'' said Ben Gelt, a recent Denver high school graduate 
who organized student gun control advocates following the Littleton 
shootings. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokesman for the National Rifle Association, Bill Powers,  
criticized efforts to ``score political points off of a tragedy'' 
and said he doesn't expect the Atlanta shootings to lead to 
significant changes in gun law. 
</P>
<P>
	``If they want to come out and debate a total handgun ban in  
America, that's a debate they'll lose with the American people,'' 
Powers said. 
</P>
<P>
	Glock Inc. and Colt's Manufacturing Company Inc. are among the  
dozens of gun makers named in lawsuits filed by Atlanta, 15 other 
cities and three counties since November. The suits allege the gun 
makers recklessly or unfairly put guns in the hands of criminals. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet unlike the low-cost, high-powered assault weapons used in  
Littleton and elsewhere, the guns used in Atlanta have drawn 
comparatively little criticism. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you believe the manufacture and sale of guns is at all  
legitimate, certainly the Colt .45 and the Glock would meet the 
description of acceptable weapons,'' conceded Naomi Paiss, a 
spokeswoman for Handgun Control Inc., a Washington group that 
lobbies for gun control. 
</P>
<P>
	The Colt .45 was used by the U.S. military from 1911 until the  
1980s, when it was phased out in favor of a Beretta. Police 
officers like the Austrian-designed Glock 9 mm for its reliability, 
ease of maintenance and light weight. 
</P>
<P>
	Both sell for $500 to $550, although custom models can cost  
more. 
</P>
<P>
	The Glock drew unwanted attention in the film ``Die Hard 2''  
when Bruce Willis' character mistakenly said the gun was 
undetectable to metal detectors because it's made entirely of 
plastic. The barrel and other parts actually are metal, notes Bob 
Glass, a gun enthusiast and publisher of the magazine The Partisan 
who has run a Glock through a metal detector. 
</P>
<P>
	``Believe me, it showed up clear as day,'' Glass said.  
</P>
<P>
	Police said a duffel bag in Barton's van also contained a  
.25-caliber Raven semiautomatic pistol and a .22-caliber Harrington 
&AMP; Richardson revolver, both of which he apparently bought legally 
in pawn shops. They weren't used in the killings. 
</P>
<P>
	The Atlanta shootings have drawn attention to two narrow  
gun-control issues: gun sales to people with psychological 
problems, and large-capacity ammunition clips. 
</P>
<P>
	The Glock can hold 16 bullets. The federal Brady bill of 1994  
banned the manufacture of clips holding more than 10 bullets, but 
allowed those already on the market to be owned and resold. 
Congress has shown little interest in broadening the ban. 
</P>
<P>
	Paiss, of Handgun Control, questioned whether psychological  
traits should bar some from owning guns. 
</P>
<P>
	Glock lawyer Paul Jannuzzo said he'd support psychological  
restrictions if there was a way of doing it. But privacy advocates 
would likely oppose opening medical records to gun vendors. 
</P>
<P>
	And there's little evidence a psychologically based ban would  
have affected Barton. Douglas County District Attorney David McDade 
recalled that a psychologist who once examined Barton after a child 
abuse complaint considered him capable of homicide. 
</P>
<P>
	However, in his written report on Barton, the psychologist  
dismissed the possibility of sexual abuse and didn't mention his 
suspicions about Barton's propensity for violence, McDade and child 
welfare officials said.

<HEADLINE> Ant Colony on Verge of Extinction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ISHIKARI, Japan (AP) -- A man in a tweed blazer and a white sun  
hat walks slowly through a patch of sea grass on the coast of 
northern Japan, searching. 
</P>
<P>
	A truck rumbles down the highway toward a cluster of cranes in  
the distance, but he doesn't look up. He bends down when he finds 
what he was looking for, a small hole in a pile of sand -- the 
entryway to the largest colony of ants ever found on earth. 
</P>
<P>
	For Prof. Seigo Higashi, this is not just an anthill, it's a  
life's work. For 28 years, he has studied, counted and even lived 
among the hundreds of millions of Japanese red wood ants that dwell 
on this strip of shoreline. 
</P>
<P>
	Higashi has observed every facet of their lifecycle, from their  
eating habits to their mating rituals. Now 50, he began studying 
the ant colony as a graduate student in his early 20s. Today, he is 
watching their ancient empire die. 
</P>
<P>
	``There used to be a whole lot of these,'' he said, kneeling to  
pick up one of the orange-brown bugs between his thumb and 
forefinger. ``Now, so many have disappeared.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the early 1970s, Higashi was part of a Hokkaido University  
team that made a startling discovery. 
</P>
<P>
	Studying ants on the coastal grasslands of Japan's northern  
island of Hokkaido, they found a cluster of nests linked in a large 
network, a supercolony. 
</P>
<P>
	At the time of its discovery, the Hokkaido colony included an  
estimated 45,000 nests and stretched nearly 12.4 miles along the 
shore of the Japan Sea. 
</P>
<P>
	The complex housed an estimated 307 million Japanese red wood  
ants, including some 306 million workers and about 1.1 million 
queens. 
</P>
<P>
	The scale was -- and still is -- unprecedented.  
</P>
<P>
	``As a species, this ant isn't rare or particularly unusual,''  
said Higashi, who took the first headcount here in 1971. ``As a 
supercolony, though, it's really something.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There are only two known ant supercolonies in the world. The  
other, smaller one is in the Swiss Jura mountains. 
</P>
<P>
	A typical ant colony is comprised mostly of one or more  
egg-laying queens and infertile females, or workers, who tend the 
young, expand the nest and defend the colony. For a short period 
once a year, the colony produces males and fertile females. These 
ants leave the nest in a ``nuptial flight'' to mate and start new 
colonies. 
</P>
<P>
	Generally, individuals from different nests will fight each  
other to the death, even if they're the same kind of ant. 
</P>
<P>
	But for reasons scientists don't fully understand, the ants here  
and in Switzerland -- both of the Formica genus -- have been able to 
build supercolonies connected by trails or tunnels through which 
workers can travel freely. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hokkaido supercolony is populated by a relatively common  
species, the Japanese red wood ant. It can be found in Japan, 
Siberia, China, Taiwan and the Korean Peninsula. 
</P>
<P>
	But only in Hokkaido is it known to have constructed a  
supercolony. 
</P>
<P>
	Higashi said he thinks the colony could have been started as  
long as 1,000 years ago near the mouth of the Ishikari River, about 
nine miles north of Sapporo, Hokkaido's largest city. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the colony wasn't discovered until this century, Higashi  
said, scientists aren't 100 percent certain of its age. 
</P>
<P>
	There is one thing he does know: It takes a lot longer to build  
a supercolony than to destroy one. 
</P>
<P>
	Construction of the new port on Ishikari Bay began in 1973. Port  
facilities were constructed, roads were built, warehouses, cement 
silos and industrial-sized freezers were installed -- all on top of 
the ant megalopolis. 
</P>
<P>
	Within a decade, the development project covered about 30  
percent of the area formerly occupied by the supercolony. Today, 
Higashi estimates, it has reduced the number of ants living there 
by more than half. 
</P>
<P>
	``If only we'd found the supercolony sooner,'' he said. ``Maybe  
then we could have done something to save it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Japanese wood ant defends itself easily. Touch the outside  
of one of their mounds, and ants will rush up your arm and deliver 
a smarting bite. 
</P>
<P>
	But it is extremely sensitive to change. Vibrations caused by  
jackhammers and trucks can easily wipe out entire nests. Roads, 
waterways and buildings can restrict the ants' ability to move 
between the nests of the colony. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the Hokkaido government and authorities in Tokyo say  
protecting the colony is not of particular concern. 
</P>
<P>
	``This species of ant is not seen as endangered,'' said Takanori  
Higuchi, a spokesman for the Environment Agency in Tokyo. ``There's 
nothing we can do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So the construction continues.  
</P>
<P>
	Higashi rarely gets out to see his ants anymore.  
</P>
<P>
	He has taken up studying several other types of ants and has  
left the research on the supercolony to his graduate students. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a pity,'' said Daniel Cherix, a professor at the  
University of Lausanne in Switzerland who has studied both the 
Swiss and the Japanese supercolonies. 
</P>
<P>
	In much of Europe, Cherix said, the Formica ant nests are  
protected. But he admitted that when economics is a factor, 
protection ``is really kind of hard.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Higashi, however, thinks the real problem is that ants are ants.  
Why would anyone want to protect bugs? 
</P>
<P>
	No one in these parts has ever made much of a fuss about what  
some might claim as a major landmark, he notes. Local papers have 
occasionally taken up the issue of protecting the colony, but most 
residents just aren't interested. 
</P>
<P>
	And outside of the immediate area, few people -- including  
officials at the Environment Agency -- have even heard of it. 
</P>
<P>
	``People just don't care,'' he said. ``If this were bears or  
something like that, maybe they would.'' 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	-- Ants have been living on the Earth for at least 100 million  
years and can be found almost anywhere on the planet. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Scientists say that about 15 percent of the Earth's total  
biomass -- the combined weight of all living things -- is composed of 
ants. Another 17 percent is taken up by termites. The combined 
weight of all ants on earth is more than the weight of all humans. 
</P>
<P>
	-- There are nearly 10,000 known species of ants, but scientists  
believe there actually may be two or three times this many in 
existence. Japan has about 260 species of ants, while there are 
about 700 species of ants in the United States and Canada. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Ants have one of the largest brains of all insects. An ant has  
about 250,000 brain cells. A human has about 10 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	-- The longest living ants -- wood ant queens -- are known to live  
more than 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Ants can lift up to 20 times their own body weight. If humans  
were this strong, a 150-pound person would be able to easily lift a 
walrus. Ants are not only strong, they are fast. If a person could 
run as fast for his size as an ant can, he could match the pace of 
a racehorse.

<HEADLINE> Diana Fund Helps Violence Victims </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Trustees of the Princess Diana memorial fund  
announced Monday that grants totaling $4.8 million would help 
victims of violence, including women raped in Rwanda, 
war-traumatized Bosnians, and refugees from Sierra Leone. 
</P>
<P>
	About $1.6 million of the new grants will go to groups clearing  
landmines in Afghanistan, Cambodia and Angola, or working for a 
global ban of the devices, a cause in which Diana took a special 
interest. 
</P>
<P>
	``This first round of international grants under our long-term  
policies reflects our determination to reach out to some of the 
most vulnerable people in the world, bringing hope to lives broken 
by violence,'' fund Chief Executive Andrew Purkis said in a 
statement. 
</P>
<P>
	The Diana, Princess of Wales, Memorial Fund has built up $115.2  
million in investments and plans to distribute at least $6.4 
million a year to causes the princess supported, its executors say. 
</P>
<P>
	The fund was set up immediately after Diana, ex-wife of heir to  
the British throne Prince Charles, was killed in a Paris car crash 
in August 1997. She was 36. 
</P>
<P>
	The fund receives donations and profits from the sale of  
approved mementos. 
</P>
<P>
	The beneficiaries announced Sunday included:  
</P>
<P>
	--Children in the Andes, $120,000.  
</P>
<P>
	--Acord, $272,000, to support Rwandan women who survived the  
genocide. 
</P>
<P>
	--Children's Legal Centre, $140,300, for children in war-affected  
areas of Kosovo, Liberia and Sri Lanka. 
</P>
<P>
	--Christian Aid, $143,400, for war victims in Sierra Leone.  
</P>
<P>
	--Rwanda Survivors Fund, $41,000, to help young rape victims.

<HEADLINE> 'Runaway Bride' Tops 'Blair Witch' / Box Office  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The ``Witch'' stole some of the newlyweds'  
blush, but the Julia Roberts-Richard Gere reunion ``Runaway Bride'' 
still managed to debut atop the weekend box office, according to 
estimates Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Blair Witch Project,'' the summer's low-budget surprise,  
came in second with $28.5 million in its first weekend of wide 
release. The horror tale, told through videotape purportedly shot 
by filmmakers who vanished while hunting for a witch, had played to 
sold-out theaters in its first two weeks on just a few dozen 
screens. 
</P>
<P>
	In wider release, ``Blair Witch'' averaged a whopping $25,886 a  
screen on 1,101 theaters. ``Runaway Bride'' played in nearly three 
times as many cinemas and averaged $10,925 a screen, pulling in 
$34.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``How could you gross $35 million and still be overshadowed by  
another film? That's really what happened'' to `Runaway Bride,''' 
said Robert Bucksbaum, a movie analyst with Reel Source Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	``Blair Witch'' helped fuel a big box-office weekend, with the  
top dozen movies expected to gross $136.8 million, up by a third 
from the same weekend last summer, according to Exhibitor Relations 
Co. Inc., which tracks ticket sales. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're just giving them a lot better choices this summer,''  
said Chuck Viane, head of distribution for Disney, which 
distributed ``Inspector Gadget'' and ``Tarzan,'' the weekend's 
fifth- and 10th-ranked movies. 
</P>
<P>
	``Blair Witch'' could be even scarier for its competition: It  
jumps to about 2,000 theaters next weekend, giving it the 
possibility of climbing to first place at the box office in its 
fourth week of release. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our object from the start was not to be the No. 1 film in  
America,'' said Amir Malin, president of ``Blair Witch'' 
distributor Artisan Entertainment. ``The object was to maximize its 
potential and do it one step at a time and build our steam up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Artisan, which acquired the movie from filmmakers Eduardo  
Sanchez and Daniel Myrick for $1 million, now expects the movie to 
take in more than $100 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``Blair Witch'' has totaled $35.4 million in its first three  
weeks. Myrick and Sanchez made ``Blair Witch'' for about $60,000, 
while Artisan spent an additional $300,000 to prepare it for 
release, Malin said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Runaway Bride'' plays to a different audience and will hold up  
well as ``Blair Witch'' continues to add theaters, said Wayne 
Lewellen, president of distribution for Paramount, which released 
the romantic comedy. 
</P>
<P>
	The movie that reunites Roberts and Gere for the first time  
since ``Pretty Woman'' draws mostly women 25 and older, while 
``Blair Witch's'' audience largely consists of young males. 
</P>
<P>
	Estimated grosses for Friday through Sunday at North American  
theaters, according to Exhibitor Relations Co. Inc. Final figures 
are to be released Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	1. ``Runaway Bride,'' $34.5 million.  
</P>
<P>
	2. ``The Blair Witch Project,'' $28.5 million.  
</P>
<P>
	3. ``Deep Blue Sea,'' $18.6 million.  
</P>
<P>
	4. ``The Haunting,'' $15.1 million.  
</P>
<P>
	5. ``Inspector Gadget,'' $14 million.  
</P>
<P>
	6. ``American Pie,'' $6.7 million.  
</P>
<P>
	7. ``Eyes Wide Shut,'' $4.4 million.  
</P>
<P>
	8. ``Big Daddy,'' $3.5 million.  
</P>
<P>
	9. ``Star Wars: Episode I -- The Phantom Menace,'' $3.4 million.  
</P>
<P>
	10. ``Tarzan,'' $3 million.

<HEADLINE> China Ups Punishment for Price Fix </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEIJING (AP) -- After 21 months of deflation, China has issued  
new rules with tougher punishments for businesses that fail to 
follow government pricing policies, state media reported Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The regulations, drafted by the government's State Development  
Planning Commission, specify fines and punishment for various price 
violations. They also list punitive measures for the charging of 
unauthorized fees, according to the official Xinhua News Agency. 
</P>
<P>
	The rules ``will play a positive role in preventing price  
irregularities, maintaining a good market order for fair and open 
competition,'' Xinhua reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Faced with overcapacity and market gluts, China's manufacturers  
have recently slashed prices or, in some cases, forged alliances 
with competitors to keep prices aloft. 
</P>
<P>
	China's existing price law made low-price dumping, price fraud  
and price monopolies illegal. 
</P>
<P>
	Nonetheless, many of China's industries -- from televisions to  
computers and through a range of home appliances -- are fighting 
price wars. Sinking steel prices forced the government to impose 
price limits. 
</P>
<P>
	Weak consumer demand has sent China's benchmark for inflation,  
the retail price index, lower for 21 months in a row. For the first 
half of 1999, retail prices slid 3.2 percent, dropping 3.4 percent 
in June alone.

<HEADLINE> Bush's Business Contacts Pay Off </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) -- Familiarity has bred profits for George  
W. Bush. 
</P>
<P>
	The Republican presidential candidate has spent much of his  
career relying on family friends and making longtime buddies out of 
his business contacts. 
</P>
<P>
	From all indications, he has done it profitably for himself and  
kept the friendships to boot. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's hard to go anywhere without running into a friend of  
his,'' said Karen Hughes, who has worked for Bush as a spokeswoman 
for five years. 
</P>
<P>
	A one-time clothing salesman and ranchhand, Bush has taken a  
career path through the oil patch, onto baseball's field of dreams 
and into the political briar patch as Texas governor. 
</P>
<P>
	Much of his business success has come from brokering deals with  
folks he knew. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush received a master's degree in business administration from  
Harvard Business School, a move he called ``a vocational training 
exercise in capitalism.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After graduation in 1975 he headed west through the far plains  
of Texas and decided to stop at the Midland oil fields. Crude 
prices were skyrocketing and he said he was attracted by the 
``entrepreneurial fever'' following the Arab oil embargo. 
</P>
<P>
	He started as a landman, checking deeds and mineral rights, and  
two years later founded an exploration firm putting together 
private partnerships for drilling ventures. He named it Arbusto, 
meaning bush in Spanish. The company did not begin active 
operations until 1979 -- a year after Bush made an unsuccessful bid 
for a congressional seat. 
</P>
<P>
	The first oil well he drilled was dry and Bush said he would  
never forget the feeling that the whole business would not be quite 
as easy as he had thought it would be. 
</P>
<P>
	His company actually drilled few wells. Instead, Bush primarily  
brokered deals or participated in those put together by others. 
</P>
<P>
	Russell S. Reynolds Jr., now a director at Oppenheimer Fund,  
Inc., was an individual investor in Arbusto. A longtime family 
friend, Reynolds got back only about 20 cents on the dollar for his 
investment in the business. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, he does not blame Bush, saying he thought that the whole  
thing was handled well, except ``you always like to make money 
instead of losing it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reynolds recently attended a campaign dinner in Connecticut for  
Bush and is still undecided whether he will have a formal role in 
this election. 
</P>
<P>
	By 1982, Arbusto was on hard times. The company had less than  
$50,000 in the bank. The company also was about $420,000 in debt. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush changed the name of the company to Bush Exploration Co. and  
took the business public. 
</P>
<P>
	During the same time period, Bush was named a director of United  
Bank of Midland. While he was a director, the bank loaned his 
company $372,000. The deal was later scrutinized, although a 
committee of the bank, which did not include Bush, had approved the 
loan. The money was repaid. 
</P>
<P>
	It was not long afterward that Bush's company merged with  
Spectrum 7 Energy Corp., a firm of Cincinnati-based investors who 
backed independent oil producers. 
</P>
<P>
	Spectrum itself was struggling. Languishing in a depressed oil  
market, within two years the company merged with Harken Energy, an 
Irving, Texas-based corporation that made its mark by buying small 
insolvent companies and making them profitable. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush and his partners got $2 million in stock in the merger and  
he became a consultant and director of Harken. 
</P>
<P>
	It was during his tenure at Harken that Bush's business dealings  
came under increased scrutiny. 
</P>
<P>
	The first incident involved a potentially lucrative offshore  
drilling project in Bahrain awarded in 1990 by the Middle Eastern 
government to Harken, even though the company had never drilled a 
well in water. 
</P>
<P>
	The media were quick to question whether Bahrain was trying to  
curry favor with Bush's father, who was president at the time. 
</P>
<P>
	The younger Bush has denied that accusation, saying he had  
nothing to do with the Bahrain deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Six months later, Bush sold nearly two-thirds of his holdings,  
or $840,000, of stock at $4 a share. A week later the company 
announced a major loss and its stock closed down about 40 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The sale was investigated by the Securities and Exchange  
Commission as possible insider trading. No action was brought 
against Bush. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush said he sold the shares to repay a loan he had taken to  
invest in the Texas Rangers baseball team in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush had had an inside track in the Rangers deal because of his  
acquaintance with majority owner Eddie Chiles, a family friend 
since Bush was in elementary school. 
</P>
<P>
	Another friend, Bill DeWitt Jr., was a partner with Bush. They  
had known each other from working together at Spectrum. 
</P>
<P>
	The original deal was nixed because the baseball commissioner  
said there was not enough local money in the offer. Bush persuaded 
a competing investment group to join his own and the new offer was 
accepted. He personally bought 1.8 percent of the club as managing 
general partner for $600,000. 
</P>
<P>
	When the team was sold last year to Dallas financier Tom Hicks,  
Bush received about $15 million -- more than 20 times his original 
investment. 
</P>
<P>
	In the years since he was elected governor, his financial  
investments have been in a state blind trust, according to Ms. 
Hughes. 
</P>
<P>
	Now that he has running for president he has filed to create a  
federal blind trust, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Blind trusts are set up to manage funds without investor input  
to assure no ethical conflicts.

<HEADLINE> First Lady Explains Husband's Lies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- First lady Hillary Rodham Clinton, in a magazine  
interview about her marriage, blames her husband's infidelity on a 
desire to please women that can be traced back to his childhood, 
according to The Sunday Times. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was so young, barely four, when he was scarred by abuse.  
There was a terrible conflict between his mother and grandmother,'' 
Mrs. Clinton told ``Talk'' magazine, according to the London-based 
newspaper, which said it obtained a copy of the interview. 
</P>
<P>
	``A psychologist once told me that for a boy being in the middle  
of a conflict between two women is the worst possible situation,'' 
Mrs. Clinton was quoted as saying. ``There is always a desire to 
please each one.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The magazine, edited by former New Yorker editor Tina Brown,  
debuts at newsstands Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton was impeached by the House of Representatives for lying  
about his affair with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky; 
the Senate acquitted him after a trial in February. 
</P>
<P>
	``He couldn't protect me, so he lied,'' Mrs. Clinton was quoted  
in the newspaper as saying. 
</P>
<P>
	In Washington, White House spokesman Jake Siewert would not  
comment on Mrs. Clinton's statements in the article. 
</P>
<P>
	``The article paints a portrait of Mrs. Clinton that is quite  
positive and it speaks for itself,'' he said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sunday Times said that Mrs. Clinton emphasized in the  
``Talk'' interview that her husband's affair with Ms. Lewinsky 
occurred after the deaths of his mother, her father and the 1993 
suicide of their close friend Vincent Foster. 
</P>
<P>
	``You know in Christian theology there are sins of weakness and  
sins of malice, and this was a sin of weakness,'' Mrs. Clinton was 
quoted as saying. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton said she thought her husband's infidelity ``was  
resolved ten years ago. ... I thought he had conquered it,'' 
according to the newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
	But she said that since the scandal, her husband ``has been  
working on himself very hard. ... He has become more aware of his 
past and what was causing this behavior.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She defended him as ``a, very, very good man,'' but said, ``Yes,  
he has weaknesses, yes he needs to be more responsible, more 
disciplined.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton also refuted suggestions that she stuck with the  
president for her own benefit, rather than out of love, The Sunday 
Times reported. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everyone has some dysfunction in their families. They have to  
deal with it. You don't walk away if you love someone. You help the 
person,'' she is quoted as saying. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton was asked by the ``Talk'' interviewer: ``And it is  
love, isn't it?'' 
</P>
<P>
	According to the London-based newspaper, she replied, ``Yes, it  
is. We have love.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton acknowledged the pain of the infidelities, but said  
it did not outweigh the close relationship the couple have built up 
throughout their marriage. 
</P>
<P>
	``Is he ashamed? Yes. Is he sorry? Yes. But does this negate  
everything he has done as a husband, a father, a president?,'' Mrs. 
Clinton asked. ``There has been enormous pain, enormous anger, but 
I have been with him half my life and he is a very, very good man. 
We just have a deep connection that transcends whatever happens.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And despite the very public scandals, Mrs. Clinton said the  
couple remain close. 
</P>
<P>
	``We talk. We talk in the solarium, in the bedroom, in the  
kitchen -- it's just constant conversation,'' she was quoted as 
saying. ``We like to lie in bed and watch old movies, you know, 
those little individual video machines you can hold on your lap.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton also talked about her move toward a run for a U.S.  
Senate seat from New York. ``Now for the first time I am making my 
own decisions. I can feel the difference. It is a great relief,'' 
she said, according to a news release from the magazine.

<HEADLINE> Hamilton, McElroy Happy With Mets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- One year ago, Darryl Hamilton was in Chicago with  
the San Francisco Giants at the trading deadline and was dealt to 
the Colorado Rockies. 
</P>
<P>
	Hamilton marked the anniversary Sunday by switching uniforms  
again, joining the New York Mets as part of a five-player deal that 
highlighted a busy day for general manager Steve Phillips. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is obviously a good deal for me,'' said Hamilton, who  
started in center field Sunday against the Chicago Cubs. ``I've got 
the opportunity to go to the playoffs. I don't want to say anything 
negative about my former teammates but I was on a sinking ship. 
It's good to be in a situation where you're playing for 
something.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Colorado traded Hamilton and left-handed reliever Chuck McElroy  
to the Mets for outfielder Brian McRae and two minor leaguers. New 
York also acquired right-hander Billy Taylor from Oakland for 
pitchers Jason Isringhausen and Greg McMichael, and got infielder 
Shawon Dunston from St. Louis for minor league infielder Craig 
Paquette. 
</P>
<P>
	Taylor, who had 26 saves and a 3.98 ERA, was expected to join  
the Mets by gametime Sunday. Dunston was not expected until Monday, 
Phillips said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going for it,'' Phillips said. ``Now's the time. You  
don't know how many times the opportunity will present itself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Phillips wanted to add veteran players for the stretch run.  
</P>
<P>
	``There's a direct correlation between the average age of a team  
and winning,'' he said. ``I don't mean to say if you get all old 
guys that you'll win, but that experience helps. Down the stretch, 
we wanted more veteran players to complement the team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hamilton, 34, is playing for his fifth team in five years.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's a lot different this year than last year,'' he said.  
``This helps my psyche a lot. Last year, I was questioning myself 
as a player.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McElroy, 31, was a questionable addition because he had listed  
New York as a city he did not want to be traded to. The reason? 
</P>
<P>
	``Taxes,'' McElroy said. ``My agent worked something out with  
(the Mets).'' 
</P>
<P>
	New York was never on Hamilton's ``no trade'' list.  
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think there's any place I'd rather be in a pennant  
race than New York,'' said Hamilton, who was hitting .303. ``New 
York is the epitome of major league baseball with the Yankees and 
the Mets.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McElroy was 3-1 with a 6.20 ERA in 41 games with the Rockies. He  
had a 2.90 ERA in 78 games last season and Phillips blamed the 
higher numbers this year on what he called the ``Colorado 
syndrome.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Our sense is that with our infield and team defense, he just  
has to put it over the plate,'' Phillips said.

<HEADLINE> Brosnan Is the New Steve McQueen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Is Pierce Brosnan the new Steve McQueen?  
</P>
<P>
	Brosnan reprises McQueen's role in the remake of ``The Thomas  
Crown Affair,'' following in the footsteps of one of his favorite 
actors. 
</P>
<P>
	``For me, McQueen could do no wrong,'' Brosnan says in Sunday's  
Daily News. ``He was and is a unique cinematic actor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, he thinks the role of Thomas Crown, a bored, wealthy man  
who gets his kicks from stealing, is a better fit for him, saying 
McQueen ``was not comfortable in such a role.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a stretch for him,'' Brosnan said. ``I, on the other  
hand, have been acting in suits, it seems, all my life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brosnan, best known wearing a tuxedo to perfection in his James  
Bond movies, costars with Rene Russo in the remake directed by John 
McTiernan. He also has another Bond film in the can. ``The World is 
Not Enough'' opens in November.

<HEADLINE> Tepid Mississippi Elections Heat Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA, Miss. (AP) -- When Gov. Kirk Fordice stepped up to  
the podium at the Neshoba County Fair last week, the crowd hoped 
for a fiery speech. 
</P>
<P>
	But, like Mississippi's campaign for governor, it was a  
lackluster Fordice who bid farewell to a state that has both 
embraced his businesslike approach to government and recoiled at 
his soap opera-like love life. 
</P>
<P>
	Tuesday, voters will begin the primary process of picking party  
nominees to replace Fordice, who is ineligible to serve a third 
term. 
</P>
<P>
	``In Mississippi we've always enjoyed robust, rambunctious  
politics, but there's not a rambunctious one in the bunch this 
year. It's so bland,'' said David Sansing, a retired University of 
Mississippi historian. ``This is the dullest political campaign in 
my memory. There's a quality of all the same politicians in a 
herd.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Candidates for the governor's job -- eight Democrats and six  
Republicans -- have espoused almost identical platforms of better 
public schools, improved crime-fighting and lower taxes. Family 
values is a popular topic. 
</P>
<P>
	Desperate to pump last-minute life in their campaigns, the  
candidates are turning to zinger commercials. 
</P>
<P>
	The frontrunners -- incumbent Democratic lieutenant governor,  
Ronnie Musgrove, and a former Republican congressman, Mike Parker -- 
both have been battered by hard-hitting television ads. 
</P>
<P>
	Musgrove has been taken to task for running up $200,000 in  
expenses in private state airplanes for trips over the past four 
years. The lawyer also is blamed in late-produced ads for the state 
Legislature's failure to pass a tax cut. 
</P>
<P>
	A 42-year-old father of two, Musgrove has set the campaign pace,  
generally ignoring ads from his strongest opponent in the 
Democratic primary, Jimmy Roberts, a former state Supreme Court 
justice. The latest polls show him with more than a 50 percentage 
points lead over Roberts, 54, and other relatively unknown 
Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
	Parker, 49, who is leading in GOP polls, is being targeted by  
former Lt. Gov. Eddie Briggs, who says Parker's 10 years in 
Congress were unremarkable and that his voting record was liberal. 
</P>
<P>
	In return, Briggs' stand on abortion is questioned in radio ads  
run on behalf of Parker. 
</P>
<P>
	At the Neshoba County Fair near Philadelphia, the most high  
profile of the state's campaign stops, one candidate said he would 
put Musgrove in prison for abusing the airplane privileges. A 
second said Musgrove supporters should ``have their heads 
examined'' and a third said he might shoot him. 
</P>
<P>
	For most of the summer, however, the campaigns have been  
overshadowed by Fordice's surprise June announcement that he was 
divorcing the first lady to marry his childhood sweetheart. The 
Fordices are still living together. 
</P>
<P>
	Mississippi has not had an open governor's seat since 1987 and  
Fordice, the first Republican governor in the state since 
Reconstruction, has not endorsed any of the GOP candidates.

<HEADLINE> PBS To Halt Donor List Exchanges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PASADENA, Calif. (AP) -- PBS stations will halt all exchanges of  
donor lists with partisan groups within a week, but when the 
political fallout for public broadcasting might end is difficult to 
predict, PBS president Ervin S. Duggan said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``By the end of this week, no station in America will be engaged  
in these practices,'' Duggan told a meeting of the Television 
Critics Association. 
</P>
<P>
	``It has delayed the (federal budget) authorization process and  
I don't know what the outcome will be,'' he said. ``I hope we can 
put it behind us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Of the 349 public television stations nationwide, PBS has  
admitted that as many as 30 appear to have engaged in list rentals 
or exchanges with political groups. 
</P>
<P>
	At issue is whether the list-swapping constitutes a violation of  
federal tax law. Tax experts have said that such exchanges would 
not be a violation as long as all political parties receives equal 
access to the lists. 
</P>
<P>
	The issue came to light in May, when Boston station WGBH-TV  
admitted giving a list of donors' names to the Democratic National 
Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Although he condemned the practice, Duggan said outside list  
brokers working for PBS stations swapped names with both Republican 
and Democratic groups. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is nonpolitical and nonpartisan behavior,'' Duggan said,  
noting that Bob Dole's 1996 presidential campaign and the 
conservative think tank Heritage Foundation were among those 
involved in swaps. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if the issue was being used by PBS critics as a weapon  
against public broadcasting, he replied carefully. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not going to deal with the motives of people on Capitol  
Hill or what might seem to some an effort to expand this issue 
beyond its proper limits,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal funding could be withheld from stations -- which get 25  
percent of their money from direct-mail appeals -- but that would be 
an overreaction because it was clear they intended to cooperate, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	In Washington, the House Commerce Committee was scheduled to  
consider funding for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting on 
July 14 but postponed the meeting after the mailing list 
disclosures. 
</P>
<P>
	Two lawmakers -- Rep. Billy Tauzin, R-La., chairman of the  
committee's telecommunications subcommittee, and Rep. Christopher 
Cox, R-Calif. -- have asked for investigations into the practice. 
</P>
<P>
	Tauzin, who was sponsoring the funding authorization bill for  
PBS, said he will reduce his funding proposal.

<HEADLINE> California Rower Reaches Australia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRISBANE, Australia (AP) -- An American who is trying to row solo  
around the world said Monday he was relieved to have reached 
Australia. 
</P>
<P>
	Mick Bird of Malibu, Calif., arrived Sunday in Cairns, a resort  
town on the northeast coast of Australia's Queensland state, after 
more than 12 months at sea. 
</P>
<P>
	Bird began his trip from Fort Bragg, Calif., on Aug. 19, 1997,  
in his 26-foot rowboat ``Reach.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He completed the first leg of his planned 27,000-mile journey by  
reaching Hilo, Hawaii, in October 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	For the latest leg, he left the Marshall Islands in April and  
said his normal routine was to row 10 hours a day. 
</P>
<P>
	Bird said when he left the Marshall Islands he was uncertain  
whether ocean currents would sweep him to Australia, Papua New 
Guinea or Indonesia. 
</P>
<P>
	Bird said he was excited when he realized he had reached the  
Queensland coast. ``I could feel the butterflies in my stomach, or 
maybe I was just hungry,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Another adventurer, Englishman Andrew Halsey, is also attempting  
to row across the Pacific Ocean. He left San Diego July 15 and is 
currently 550 miles west of the West Coast.

<HEADLINE> Griffey Mum on Piniella Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- Ken Griffey Jr. doesn't want to talk about his  
future with the Seattle Mariners. But his father, Ken Sr., the 
bench coach with the Cincinnati Reds, is doing a lot of talking for 
him. 
</P>
<P>
	``Do I look like I'm in Dayton?'' the Mariners' slugger said  
when asked about a story in Sunday's editions of the Dayton Daily 
News that said the Mariners were in a mood to fire manager Lou 
Piniella and replace him with Griffey Sr. 
</P>
<P>
	Griffey Sr. told the Dayton newspaper, ``That might be the only  
way to keep Junior. He said he's gone.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't read what you all write,'' Griffey said after  
Seattle's 3-1 victory over Baltimore. ``I'm not in Dayton.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mariners president Chuck Armstrong said he had no reaction to  
the Dayton story. 
</P>
<P>
	``Lou is signed through 2000,'' Armstrong said before walking  
away from a reporter. 
</P>
<P>
	Griffey, 29, leads the American League with 34 home runs and has  
384 career homers. He is signed through the 2000 season and the 
Mariners have said they want to sign him to a contract extension. 
</P>
<P>
	Griffey is believed to be unhappy with the Mariners' new Safeco  
Field, where he has two homers in his first 11 games in the 
ballpark. He hit 198 of his homers in the Kingdome, which the 
Mariners left after a game June 27. 
</P>
<P>
	He has said he's unhappy with the Mariners' lack of pitching.  
The Mariners have the worst ERA in the AL at 5.81. 
</P>
<P>
	Griffey had a rare bad defensive day Sunday. He lost two fly  
balls in the sun in the sixth inning when the Orioles scored their 
only run off the Mariners. Both were ruled hits.

<P>
	He was not in an expansive mood about that subject, either.  
</P>
<P>
	``I don't want to talk about that,'' the nine-time Gold Glove  
center fielder said. ``You all saw it.''

<HEADLINE> Mexico 1, U.S. 0 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MEXICO CITY (AP) -- The goalkeeping of Kasey Keller could carry  
the United States only so far. 
</P>
<P>
	Mexico defeated the United States 1-0 on goal by Cuauahtemoc  
Blanco in sudden-death overtime Sunday to advance to the final of 
the Confederations Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mexicans will play Brazil on Wednesday for the title. The  
United States will face Saudi Arabia for third place on Tuesday in 
Guadalajara. 
</P>
<P>
	Brazil routed Saudi Arabia 8-2 in the other semifinal in  
Guadalajara, with Ronaldinho scoring three times and Alex twice. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States, before a crowd of 80,000 at Azteca Stadium,  
was trying to pull off another stunner following its quarterfinal 
victory over Germany. 
</P>
<P>
	This would have been the Americans' first victory at Azteca  
Stadium. But the altitude of 7,350 feet and less than two days of 
rest were too much to overcome. 
</P>
<P>
	There was also the persistent Mexican attack, which left the  
U.S. team under siege and surviving thanks to Keller's exceptional 
work. 
</P>
<P>
	Blanco had been tied up by Jeff Agoos and later Eddie Lewis for  
most of the game. But five minutes into overtime he finally broke 
through. 
</P>
<P>
	He first tried to kick the loose ball with his right foot, but  
it bounced off a defender as Keller went to his left. Blanco then 
pushed the ball in the net for his fifth goal of the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	The loss dropped the Americans' record to 6-3-1 this season.  
They are 0-16-1 at Azteca. 
</P>
<P>
	During regulation play, Mexico's first chance came in the second  
minute. Blanco sent a pass to Isaac Terrazas down the right side, 
but Terrazas' low shot was stopped by Keller. 
</P>
<P>
	Mexico relied on speed, featuring an attack down the right side  
with Terrazas, Jose Manuel Abundis up front and Blanco and Ramon 
Ramirez orchestrating play. 
</P>
<P>
	In the eighth minute, Keller dived to deflect a shot by Rafael  
Marquez. Two minutes later, he again went to his left to stop a 
shot by Ramirez that was heading for the upper corner. 
</P>
<P>
	Cobi Jones and Frankie Hejduk missed with wide shots during the  
same stretch, but the U.S. attackers never posed a serious threat 
to Mexican goalie Jorge Campos. 
</P>
<P>
	Keller saved the United States again in the 47th minute when he  
deflected a shot from a few yards away by Gerardo Torrado as the 
Mexicans kept the pressure on. 
</P>
<P>
	In the 53rd minute, Jones got away down the left side. He passed  
to Ernie Stewart whose clear shot was stopped by Campos. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones took advantage of a Mexican mistake in the 66th minute and  
swept down the left side. But his lob over the goalie went high 
over the crossbar.

<HEADLINE> Boy on Ventilator Dies From Heat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEWNAN, Ga. (AP) -- A 14-year-old boy confined to a bed and  
requiring a ventilator to breathe died of heat stroke Sunday in a 
home where the electricity had been turned off by the utility 
company. 
</P>
<P>
	The teenager's battery-run ventilator continued to work without  
electricity, but the home's central air conditioning shut down. The 
boy, who suffered a gunshot wound three years ago, died at 3 a.m. 
Sunday, said Coroner W.H. Pierce. He did not release the boy's 
name. 
</P>
<P>
	``This shouldn't happen. My son shouldn't be dead,'' the boy's  
mother, Thelma Dennis, told Atlanta television station WSB. ``He 
died for what? Because they wouldn't turn the lights on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The boy's body temperature was 107 when he died, the coroner  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Dennis McEntire of Newnan Utilities said the power was turned  
off as a result of miscommunication among the company, Ms. Dennis 
and her new landlord. The family had moved in last week. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a very tragic situation. Our thoughts are certainly with  
her,'' McEntire said. He said the power would not have been 
switched off if the company knew of the situation. 
</P>
<P>
	He said Ms. Dennis' new landlord had requested the shutoff and  
that Ms. Dennis was told to come in to make arrangements for the 
new address. It was unclear if she had done that or thought the 
matter was resolved. 
</P>
<P>
	The teen's death was the second heat-related death in Newnan,  
about 30 miles southwest of Atlanta, and the third in Georgia in 
the recent heat wave.

<HEADLINE> Four Die in Ohio Plane Crash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NORTH LIMA, Ohio (AP) -- A single-engine plane crashed in a  
cornfield just after takeoff Sunday, killing four of the five 
people aboard, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	The fifth person, a 15-year-old boy, was hospitalized in serious  
condition at Cleveland MetroHealth Medical Center, a nursing 
supervisor said. No names were released. 
</P>
<P>
	The six-seater Piper Cherokee's flight originated in Oshkosh,  
Wis., and was headed to Pennsylvania when it crashed at about 2 
p.m. a half-mile north of the airfield in North Lima, where it had 
stopped to refuel, said state Highway Patrol Lt. Brian Girts. 
</P>
<P>
	North Lima is 66 miles southeast of Cleveland.  
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Aviation Authority was investigating and had not  
determined the cause of the crash. 
</P>
<P>
	The crash occurred about 150 miles southeast of Cottrellville  
Township, Mich., the site of a small plane crash Saturday that 
killed a group of nine skydivers and the pilot. The plane in 
Michigan also crashed shortly after takeoff.

<HEADLINE> Calif. Street Kids Get a Prom Night </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- Her stringy green hair dyed gold, her  
emerald eyes framed by lavender liner, she steps out of the limo -- 
a real-life Cinderella in a purple satin dress. 
</P>
<P>
	People on the sidewalk stop to stare as the girl and her  
handsome date move from the twilight into a shimmering, candlelit 
ballroom for a four-course meal and a night of music and dancing. 
</P>
<P>
	``It feels so good to be looked at like human beings,'' said the  
18-year-old known as Cuddles. ``This is the one night they look at 
us and don't think we're just street kids.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On any other night, she would be sitting on the gum-stained  
steps of the public square she calls home, chain-smoking cigarettes 
alongside other homeless kids with mohawk haircuts, body piercings 
and tattoos. 
</P>
<P>
	But for a few hours on prom night, Sunday, June 27, the cold  
rain, the drugs and loneliness are behind them. 
</P>
<P>
	Cuddles and her boyfriend, Tigger, are among nearly 200 street  
kids primping for the prom, a gala not for graduates of the city's 
high schools but for the homeless teens roaming its streets. 
</P>
<P>
	``You'll see kids who all they do is walk around wanting to kill  
themselves,'' says Cuddles, ``and on that day they're totally 
different. They're just so high on life. I'm going as a princess.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cuddles, real name Eorica Mohring, is a bit of a misnomer for a  
kid whose three years on the streets have been anything but warm 
and fuzzy. 
</P>
<P>
	She has been strung out on crystal meth, cocaine, pot and LSD.  
She has prostituted herself, been beaten up, shot and raped. She 
occasionally gets to visit the year-old daughter she gave up for 
adoption. 
</P>
<P>
	For 10 years, the Salvation Army has sponsored the prom for  
street kids at Greenhouse, a downtown drop-in center where nearly 
1,000 young people stop every year to get a sandwich, take a shower 
and duck out of the rain. With up to 1,800 homeless teens in a town 
of 500,000, Portland has more street kids per capita than most 
cities. The vast majority are white kids aged 12-21 who flock 
downtown from Portland's suburbs. 
</P>
<P>
	``They don't get the kind of marker events like a prom or  
graduation that other people take for granted,'' says Rowanne 
Haley, city coordinator for the Salvation Army. ``The prom is 
designed to show that people care enough about them to provide good 
things for them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A downtown banquet hall opens up its ballroom complete with  
vaulted ceilings, bronze chandeliers and a stunning view of 
snowcapped Mount Hood. 
</P>
<P>
	Caterers answer the call with a buffet dinner of charbroiled  
citrus chicken and fusilli pasta smothered in creamy pesto sauce. 
It's topped off with a dessert of hand-dipped chocolate-covered 
strawberries and sparkling apple cider. 
</P>
<P>
	On prom day, professional manicurists show up to clean dirty  
cuticles and paint broken nails. Hair stylists trim shaggy bangs 
and curl wiry hair. 
</P>
<P>
	Then a fleet of limousines and horse-drawn carriages whisks the  
kids to the prom, where they stand in line for a studio 
photographer and dance to tunes spun by a club DJ. The boys wear 
boutonnieres, the girls corsages. 
</P>
<P>
	And it's all donated, including the clothes on the kids' backs.  
</P>
<P>
	Just days before the prom, Cuddles steps from behind a clothes  
rack at a Salvation Army warehouse packed with dresses of lacy 
satin and glimmering velvet. She's squeezed into a tight, royal 
blue evening dress that puckers around her belly and doesn't quite 
stretch to her knees. Bra straps peek out and slide down her pale 
shoulders. 
</P>
<P>
	Her boyfriend Tigger grabs his chin and silently shakes his  
head. 
</P>
<P>
	``How about this?'' calls Noel Richmond, a Greenhouse volunteer  
who helped organize the first prom. She's holding up a pink, 
flapper dress. Black sequins coat it like fish scales. 
</P>
<P>
	``It looks like a '50s hooker,'' complains Cuddles.  
</P>
<P>
	The search continues, Cuddles slapping the hangars together and  
giving each dress the once-over. Racks of pinstriped suits and 
tuxedos crowd the other side of the room. Cardboard boxes are 
stuffed with cummerbunds, bow ties and socks -- all donations saved 
for prom-goers. 
</P>
<P>
	Finally, Cuddles chooses a dress and disappears behind the rack  
to try it on. She reappears draped in a silky plum-colored dress 
with drop-shoulders. 
</P>
<P>
	``Do you really like it?'' she asks Tigger. ``I mean, could you  
stand me dressed in this all day?'' 
</P>
<P>
	He nods, and they begin looking for shoes.  
</P>
<P>
	Before leaving, Cuddles puts in a special request with  
volunteers: Lee Press-On Nails. 
</P>
<P>
	Cuddles has been dating Tigger, whose real name is Nathan  
Alleger, since November. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I saw him for the first time, I just freaked,'' she says.  
``My heart just exploded out of my chest.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tigger is skinny, with deep set eyes, clear skin and spiky,  
blond hair. The 16-year-old has a wispy mustache and his street 
name tattooed across his knuckles. 
</P>
<P>
	He describes a childhood of neglect, beatings and sexual abuse.  
Everybody at Greenhouse has similar stories. 
</P>
<P>
	``These kids don't make the choice to live on the streets,''  
prom organizer Richmond says. ``They may choose to leave abusive 
home, but they don't choose to live under bridges.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Greenhouse makes sure to kick off each prom with a graduation  
ceremony celebrating those who earned their graduation equivalency 
degrees. Before the first fork is lifted, prom-goers whoop and 
holler for the 30 graduates who strut across the stage in blue cap 
and gowns. 
</P>
<P>
	``The prom's actually there to glorify the fact that street kids  
have done something with their lives,'' Cuddles says. ``You do 
something good, you're going to have a party for it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier in the day, Cuddles underwent a three-hour  
transformation -- blush, eyeshadow, lipstick and eyeliner. In a 
final touch fitting for a princess, she sticks shimmering 
rhinestones to her forehead like the jewels of a crown. 
</P>
<P>
	Cuddles holds up a mirror and screams.  
</P>
<P>
	``Oh my God! I'm glorified!''  
</P>
<P>
	At the banquet hall, the couple settles down at a table near the  
stage. Tigger is transformed too, his baggy jeans and basketball 
jersey traded for patent-leather shoes and a snappy black suit with 
a pink rose pinned to his lapel. 
</P>
<P>
	Right away, cracks appear in the romantic facade as AC/DC's  
``You Shook Me All Night Long'' rocks the room. Cuddles starts 
belting out the lyrics; Tigger slumps on a table and rubs his eyes 
in misery. 
</P>
<P>
	Cuddles rushes over to her friend, Teacup.  
</P>
<P>
	``He doesn't want to dance. He doesn't know how!'' Cuddles says.  
</P>
<P>
	Cuddles doesn't give up. As the DJ switches to a slow song, she  
grabs Tigger's hand and yanks him to the floor. 
</P>
<P>
	Rigidly, they rock like teetering bowling pins.  
</P>
<P>
	For a brief moment, they are more like bright-eyed high school  
seniors on their way to college than two homeless kids with 
uncertain futures. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wouldn't say it changes anybody's life,'' Richmond said.  
``But it creates a positive memory, something to hold on to. And 
those seeds of memory in our hearts are what make us stronger 
people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The next morning, after a night in the homeless shelter, Cuddles  
and Tigger woke up looking at the streets a little differently. 
</P>
<P>
	``It motivated me a lot,'' she said. ``I wanted to be looked at  
all the time like we were looked at the prom.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She still wore her Lee Press-On Nails when she and Tigger  
applied for jobs at Nordstrom and Subway and began talking about 
the future. 
</P>
<P>
	In the shelter locker where she stows her possessions, Cuddles  
adds mementos from the night before: her dress, the shoes, her 
corsage. And in a carefully folded plastic bag, the sparkling 
rhinestones that made her a princess.

<HEADLINE> Mich. Plane Crash Victims Mourned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COTTRELLVILLE TOWNSHIP, Mich. (AP) -- A gathering that was  
supposed to be a fun-filled weekend of skydiving, camping, food and 
music became an occasion for mourning after 10 people were killed 
when their plane crashed en route to the activity they loved. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 100 members of the Parahawks, a decades-old skydiving  
club based at the Marine City Airport, had gathered for their 
annual pig roast. The crash occurred on the final day of the 
three-day event. 
</P>
<P>
	The club was founded by Pete Myks of Pleasant Ridge. About 10  
years ago, Myks turned the operation over to his wife, Nora, and 
his son, Paul, The Detroit News reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Paul Myks, 40, of Canton Township and a DC-9 captain with Spirit  
Airlines, was at the controls of the twin-engine 1967 Beech King 
Air 65A-90 that veered left and plummeted into a hayfield moments 
after takeoff. 
</P>
<P>
	Several hundred people attended a memorial service Sunday for  
the victims. The service was led by a Michigan State Police 
chaplain and was held at the end of a runway at Marine City Airport 
in full view of the wreckage. 
</P>
<P>
	Russ Turner, a skydiver who has made more than 1,200 jumps,  
praised Myks following the service. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've known him since he was 12,'' Turner said as he fought  
back tears. ``He was a great father, a great husband, a great 
pilot, a great friend and a great jumper. He was professional about 
everything he did.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Myks, who owned the plane, had logged more than 9,000 hours of  
flight time, making him ``very experienced,'' said George Black, a 
spokesman for the National Transportation Safety Board. Myks also 
owned three other planes and was an expert skydiver himself. 
</P>
<P>
	He had taken about 20 flights Friday in the plane that later  
crashed, said Rob Ward, a local man with a plane of his own at the 
airport. 
</P>
<P>
	Saturday morning's fatal flight was the first of the day.  
</P>
<P>
	Gary Cooper, regional director of the U.S. Parachute  
Association, said other members of the club were ``hard-hit by the 
deaths.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a real close community,'' he said. ``Everybody knows  
everybody. It's kind of like a motorcycle club.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One of the victims, Dawn Alford, 29, of Waterford, went to  
Marine City nearly every weekend to satisfy her love of skydiving, 
her next-door neighbor, Peter Markovski, told The Oakland Press of 
Pontiac. 
</P>
<P>
	``She really loved it,'' he said. ``She was just a really good  
person and neighbor. She was there when you needed her. We helped 
each other out a lot in the yard.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The crash wasn't the first tragedy for the club. In 1980, a  
33-year-old Parahawk member from Taylor died when his parachute 
failed to open, and in 1992, a 21-year-old Parahawk member from 
Oxford died when his chute failed, the Times Herald of Port Huron 
reported.

<HEADLINE> Sixers Re-Sign Snow, Lynch </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- The Philadelphia 76ers retained two key  
players from last year's 28-22 squad Sunday, re-signing point guard 
Eric Snow and small forward George Lynch. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our priority has been to keep our family intact,'' general  
manager Billy King said. ``Keeping Eric and George is a big part of 
that. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm just glad now it is official and I'm happy we were able to  
keep George and Eric part of our group. We're happy with what we've 
done, but our job's not finished,'' King said. 
</P>
<P>
	King refused to speculate on what future moves the Sixers might  
be contemplating, either via free agency or trade. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not going to do anything to jeopardize our nucleus by  
getting rid of a key player,'' King said. 
</P>
<P>
	While no terms were released, it was believed Snow agreed to a  
contract running from five to seven years, starting around $3 
million per season. His agent, Steve Kauffman, did not return phone 
calls. 
</P>
<P>
	Lynch's agent, Lee Fentress, also did not return a call. Lynch  
earned the $550,000 veteran minimum last season. 
</P>
<P>
	Following a season in which the 6-8 Lynch played exceptionally  
well the first half of the year before being slowed by a knee 
injury, Sixers' coach Larry Brown said he was hopeful Lynch would 
return. 
</P>
<P>
	The 26-year-old Snow averaged 8.6 points 6.3 assists and 2.08  
steals in the first year he received meaningful playing time in his 
four-year career. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think our focus is still the same,'' said Snow, who  
considered an offer from the Toronto Raptors before deciding not to 
leave Philadelphia. ``We need for everyone to come out and play 
hard the whole game, play defense and play unselfishly. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we can continue to have that, we can compete with anyone.''  
</P>
<P>
	The signings of Snow and Lynch bring to 10 the number of players  
from last year's squad the Sixers currently have under guaranteed 
contract, plus No. 1 pick Jumaine Jones. 
</P>
<P>
	Five other players from last year's squad, along with No. 2 pick  
Todd MacCulloch, who is playing for the Canadian national team, 
have yet to come to terms.

<HEADLINE> Braves Try To Stump Mets With Trades </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- After watching their closest rival wheel and deal  
throughout the day, the Atlanta Braves waited until the last 
possible minute -- literally -- to pull off a trade with the Chicago 
Cubs. 
</P>
<P>
	Will Jose Hernandez and Terry Mulholland help the Braves hold  
off the New York Mets? 
</P>
<P>
	``I sure hope so,'' said Atlanta general manager John  
Schuerholz, who dealt left-hander Micah Bowie and two 
minor-leaguers to the Cubs late Saturday. ``We were able to get two 
guys who've been productive and are very experienced. They will 
help make up for the loss of the guys we're missing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Braves, facing their first pennant race in six years,  
already have lost Andres Galarraga, Kerry Ligtenberg, Javy Lopez 
and Odalis Perez to injuries. The shaky health of John Smoltz and 
Walt Weiss forced Schuerholz to make a move of some sort. 
</P>
<P>
	After talking with four or five teams, the Braves GM finalized a  
deal with the Cubs less than a minute before the midnight Saturday 
EDT deadline. 
</P>
<P>
	Atlanta defeated Philadelphia 12-4 on Sunday to maintain its  
half-game lead over the Mets in the NL East. The Phillies dropped 
to 6 1/2 games back. 
</P>
<P>
	New York, having already acquired pitcher Kenny Rogers from  
Oakland, was the busiest team on the final day before the trading 
deadline, making three of the nine deals completed Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	New York acquired reliever Billy Taylor from the Athletics,  
outfielder Darryl Hamilton and left-hander Chuck McElroy from 
Colorado, and infielder Shawon Dunston from St. Louis. They gave up 
pitchers Jason Isringhausen and Greg McMichael, outfielder Brian 
McRae and three minor leaguers. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going for it,'' New York GM Steve Phillips said. ``You  
don't know how many times the opportunity will present itself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 30-year-old Hernandez, who is hitting .272 with 15 homers  
and 43 RBIs, can play second, short, third and the outfield. The 
Cubs had tried to keep him, offering a three-year contract, but his 
agent wanted more money and four years. 
</P>
<P>
	``I got into an argument with my wife when I got home after  
(Saturday's) game,'' said Hernandez, who is making $2.4 million in 
the final year of the deal. ``I didn't know what to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And now?  
</P>
<P>
	``We've got to move along,'' he said sadly.  
</P>
<P>
	Mulholland, who is 6-6 with a 5.15 ERA, adds depth to a Braves  
pitching staff that has struggled to find a fifth starter while 
managing to get by with a nondescript bullpen. 
</P>
<P>
	The 36-year-old, who can start or relieve, is used to moving  
around. Mulholland has played for five teams in seven years, and 
bought moving boxes a few days before the trading deadline. 
</P>
<P>
	``Actually, it was a surprise,'' said Mulholland, who has  
another year on the contract that pays him $2.925 million this 
season. ``I still believe these guys (in Chicago) are capable of 
playing well. It kind of twists in my gut that I'm not a part of 
it. On the plus side, I'll be with Atlanta.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mulholland and Hernandez are scheduled to join the Braves on  
Tuesday in Pittsburgh. The Braves will have to drop a position 
player from their 25-man roster; 40-year-old Otis Nixon, hitting 
only .188 but leading the team with 18 steals, is a possibility. 
</P>
<P>
	Bowie, a 24-year-old left-hander, was 0-1 with a 13.50 ERA for  
the Braves after being called up recently from Triple-A Richmond. 
He will start Tuesday against Montreal. 
</P>
<P>
	The Braves also gave up right-hander Ruben Quevedo, who is not  
on Atlanta's 40-man roster, and a minor-leaguer to be named. 
Quevedo, 20, was 6-5 with a 5.37 ERA in 21 games at Richmond, 
ranking second in the International League with 26 homers allowed. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think this was an opportunity to acquire two starting  
pitchers,'' Cubs GM Ed Lynch said. ``It just so happens that they 
are young players. When you have a chance to acquire two young 
starting pitchers, you do it.''

<HEADLINE>  Mourners Bury Atlanta Killer's Wife </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LIZELLA, Ga. (AP) -- Mourners packed a rural church Sunday for  
the funeral of Leigh Ann Barton, the first of 12 victims in her 
husband's killing spree last week, as a pastor urged them not to 
``allow her murder to cloud our memory.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Girl Scouts in uniform passed out tissues before the service.  
</P>
<P>
	Mark O. Barton, 44, killed his wife with a hammer Tuesday night  
in her suburban apartment south of Atlanta. It was the first of a 
string of murders that would become Georgia's worst mass killing 
this century. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, Barton bludgeoned to death his two children from a  
previous marriage. The next day, he marched into two brokerage 
firms in the city's Buckhead commercial district and opened fire 
with two handguns, killing nine people and wounding 13 others. When 
police cornered Barton hours later, he committed suicide. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm afraid there's a temptation to become focused on the  
horrible events of last week,'' the Rev. Doug Davis told about 400 
mourners at the Lizella Baptist Church, 11 miles west of Macon, 
where Mrs. Barton grew up. ``If we give into that temptation, we do 
a great disservice to Leigh Ann.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Davis also read a letter from Mrs. Barton's sister, Dana Reeves,  
that addressed the 27-year-old by her pet nickname, ``Goldilocks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I only wish I could have spared you all of this ... I know you  
are in a safe place now,'' the letter said. 
</P>
<P>
	Also Sunday, services were held in Peachtree City for shooting  
victim Vadewattee Muradlidhara, 44. She will be buried in her 
native Trinidad. A memorial service was also held Sunday for Allen 
Charles Tenenbaum, who was buried Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Nine of the wounded were still hospitalized Sunday, three in  
critical condition. 
</P>
<P>
	Many churches in the Atlanta area addressed the violence in  
Sunday's regular services. 
</P>
<P>
	At the Antioch Baptist Church North in Atlanta, the Rev. Kenneth  
L. Alexander asked parishioners to ``pray for our city. The devil 
is busy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mayor Bill Campbell told the Antioch congregation ``our city is  
in crisis.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's almost unimaginable the horror, the tragedy we've endured  
just in the last two weeks,'' Campbell said, referring to another 
mass killing two weeks ago in which seven were killed. ``When 
people ask us what can we do about Atlanta's image, there's really 
only one answer and that is prayer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At St. Pius X Roman Catholic Church in the Atlanta suburb of  
Conyers, several parishioners knew Joe Dessert, a retired real 
estate broker who was dabbling in day trading. He was one of those 
killed Thursday at the offices of All-Tech Investment Group. 
</P>
<P>
	One said he had tried to get Dessert to quit day trading at  
All-Tech, where Barton also traded. 
</P>
<P>
	``It just wasn't like him to gamble like that,'' said Tony  
Nicholson, who had lunch with 60-year-old Dessert an hour before 
the shooting. ``And he even thought about ... setting up another 
office to trade from, but then figured he had everything he needed 
at All-Tech.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Barton's lawyer said Sunday the gunman approved some changes to  
his will Thursday morning, a few hours before the shootings. He 
gave no indication he had already killed his wife and children, 
said Douglasville attorney Joe Fowler. 
</P>
<P>
	``He looked in all respects normal, just like any other time he  
came into my office,'' Fowler said. 
</P>
<P>
	Fowler would not comment on Barton's changes.  
</P>
<P>
	In its Aug. 9 issue, Newsweek magazine reports that Barton  
recently changed his profile on his America Online account to 
include guns as a hobby and ``Make my day'' -- the line Clint 
Eastwood's character Dirty Harry uttered before gunning criminals -- 
as his personal motto. 
</P>
<P>
	A funeral for Barton's children -- Matthew, 11, and Mychelle, 7 --  
was scheduled for Monday in Lithia Springs. 
</P>
<P>
	The children's mother, Debra Barton, and maternal grandmother  
were hacked to death in Alabama in 1993. Police said Barton, who 
was having an affair with then-Leigh Ann Vandiver, was a suspect 
although he was never charged.

<HEADLINE> Family Copes As Umpire Is Released </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Betsy Hallion and her three boys kept looking out the window.  
</P>
<P>
	They knew baseball was releasing 13 National League umpires by  
letter via Federal Express. What they didn't know was whether Dad, 
Tom Hallion, was on the hit list. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were on pins and needles all day,'' she said by telephone  
from her home in Louisville, Ky. ``Every time a truck came down the 
street, you wondered. It was driving the kids crazy. It was driving 
me crazy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	By mid-afternoon Thursday, the anxiety had become too much. So  
with her husband still on the field at Veterans Stadium, she 
rounded up 13-year-old Corey, 10-year-old Kyle and 3-year-old Jake 
and got in the car. 
</P>
<P>
	``We came back at 5:30 and there was nothing from FedEx. No  
letter,'' she said, her tears gone. ``We thought we were safe.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hallion called a half-hour later from the airport in  
Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
	``I asked him, `Well, what is it?' He said, `I lost my job.'''  
</P>
<P>
	The final out.  
</P>
<P>
	At 42, Hallion had spent more than half his life as a  
professional umpire. Rated as one of the majors' best in a players' 
poll -- taken before his three-game suspension this year -- he joined 
other umps in a recent mass resignation plan. 
</P>
<P>
	But the ploy backfired when baseball hired minor leaguers to  
replace them starting in September. In all, the resignations of 22 
major league umps were accepted, including Hallion's. 
</P>
<P>
	``We soul-searched for two days when it was presented,'' Mrs.  
Hallion said. ``I said to him, `Are you ready for the worst?' All 
he ever wanted to be was an umpire.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We didn't think we were jumping off a cliff,'' she said.  
</P>
<P>
	It has turned into an emotional, bitter fight among a group of  
men who stood together for years and now have split apart over 
umpires' union chief Richie Phillips' leadership. 
</P>
<P>
	Even umpires' wives have entered the fray -- one wife angrily  
chastised another whose husband did not turn in his resignation, 
calling him a ``Judas'' for turning his back on the union. 
</P>
<P>
	Hallion was headed for a 12-hour stopover in Louisville when he  
phoned Betsy. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't know how to tell her,'' he said Friday night in  
Milwaukee, where he worked the Brewers-Montreal game. ``I called 
three people first to see how I should do it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Afterward, his wife said, ``I cried all day. It was probably the  
worst day of our lives.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``People were calling the house,'' Hallion said. ``How do you  
tell them why you were one of the 13?'' 
</P>
<P>
	He is sure he was targeted for bumping Colorado catcher Jeff  
Reed and coach Milt May in June, which led to Hallion's suspension. 
</P>
<P>
	For the Hallions, it all means coming to grips with the loss of  
the only life they'd known. There's also his salary of $160,000, 
including bonuses. That's a far cry from the minors, when fancy 
dinners meant all-you-can-eat salad bars and hotels meant $9 rooms. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would like to be able to stay in this house because this is  
where the boys grew up,'' Mrs. Hallion said. ``But there will be 
lifestyle changes. 
</P>
<P>
	``We hope this is not over,'' she said. ``But if this is the  
end, there will be life without baseball.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Hallion, who does not work now, plans to do computer work  
out of her home. Her husband has had offers, she said, but declined 
to be specific. 
</P>
<P>
	They married in September 1983 and the following month were sent  
to work winter ball in the Dominican Republic. Sweethearts from 
upstate Saugerties, N.Y., they left friends and family behind and 
moved to Louisville in March 1984. 
</P>
<P>
	``We didn't know a soul,'' she said. ``We picked it when he was  
in the American Association because it was centrally located. It 
gave us a chance to see each other for a few hours when he was 
going between cities.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The next year, Hallion worked his first NL game. In 1986, after  
eight seasons of stops in the New York-Penn, Carolina and Eastern 
leagues and the American Association, he joined the NL staff. 
</P>
<P>
	For a major league umpire, the travel, money and prestige are  
satisfying, no doubt. But the job also means long separations, and 
missed birthday parties and Little League games. 
</P>
<P>
	Umps have no home games.  
</P>
<P>
	Corey and Kyle grew up watching their father work, visiting the  
umpires' locker rooms and sitting up proud when they saw him on TV. 
Mrs. Hallion is sad that Jake, the youngest, may miss out on that. 
</P>
<P>
	And she's disappointed her husband may not fulfill his lifelong  
dream to call a World Series game -- he may have been in line to do 
it this year. She's concerned he might feel he did not do a good 
job, even though the players' rating shows otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want people to know he was a good umpire, and that he cared  
about being the best he could be,'' she said. ``This job was so 
important to him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And it all ended with a letter from baseball.  
</P>
<P>
	That letter, by the way, eventually arrived at the Hallion  
household. The following day.

<HEADLINE> Favre Joins Packers' Camp </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GREEN BAY, Wis. (AP) -- Brett Favre may have looked a little  
rusty in his 1999 training camp debut, but his presence was 
welcomed. 
</P>
<P>
	Favre, who missed the first days of camp while in Mississippi  
with his wife and their baby, arrived Saturday and went through a 
Sunday morning workout of more than two hours with his teammates. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was good to have Brett Favre back here,'' coach Ray Rhodes  
said. ``Brett brings a lot of spark to our offensive unit and 
that's big for our football team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Favre's second daughter, Breleigh Ann, was born five weeks  
premature July 13 in Hattiesburg, Miss., and was in a hospital 
until Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Quarterbacks Rick Mirer, Matt Hasselbeck, Aaron Brooks and  
Ronnie McAda picked up the slack for the three-time MVP while he 
was gone. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a little rusty but we love to have him back,'' offensive  
coordinator Sherm Lewis said. ``It looks great to have him in there 
and I think the guys feel good when he's there. I think he was a 
little rusty throwing the ball, but that's it.''

<P>
	KENT, Wash. (AP) -- Joe Amato won his second straight NHRA  
national event Sunday at the 12th annual Prolong Super Lubricants 
Northwest Nationals. 
</P>
<P>
	Amato, the defending event champion in Top Fuel, sped down the  
track in 4.704 seconds at 306.95 mph, enough to hold off Doug 
Kalitta, who ran a 4.697 at 307.58. 
</P>
<P>
	It was Amato's fourth win this year and the second straight race  
where he defeated Kalitta in the final round. 
</P>

	Del Worsham earned his first victory in eight years when he  
raced his Pontiac Firebird to a 5.283 at 279.67 as Whit Bazemore 
lost traction and finished with a 7.302 at 163.67. 
</P>
<P>
	Kurt Johnson captured his third victory of the season when he  
covered the quarter-mile in 6.923 at 200.44 in his Chevrolet 
Camaro, edging out Jim Yates, who ran a 6.962 at 198.00.

<HEADLINE> Bills' Smith Loses Weight </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FREDONIA, N.Y. (AP) -- When Buffalo running back Antowain Smith  
heard that the Bills were taking a serious look at troubled 
Lawrence Phillips during the offseason, he got that sinking 
feeling. 
</P>
<P>
	Then Smith got moving.  
</P>
<P>
	He got up early to lift weights. He went running in the searing  
heat of Houston's summer afternoons. He peeled the skin off chicken 
and piled vegetables on his plate. 
</P>
<P>
	He shed pounds like winter clothes, but fear of losing the  
Bills' confidence stuck to Smith like a hair shirt. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were trying to tell me something,'' said Smith, who  
gained a respectable but unspectacular 1,124 yards last season 
while averaging what for him was a disappointing 3.8 yards per 
carry. 
</P>
<P>
	Message sent, message received.  
</P>
<P>
	Carrying a dozen fewer pounds than last year, a lean and wary  
Smith showed up for the start of training camp at Fredonia State 
over the weekend hopping lightly, cutting sharply and running like 
a man being chased by an assailant with a blowtorch. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel pretty good out there,'' Smith said.  
</P>
<P>
	He looks good, too, his teammates say.  
</P>
<P>
	``He's always had a lot of ability but now he's really starting  
to work to do everything that's asked of him,'' Bills fullback Sam 
Gash said. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith will be asked to do more than just run the ball, as he'll  
likely figure more prominently in the passing game. Last year he 
caught only five passes after making 28 catches as a rookie. 
</P>
<P>
	Propelled by rigorous workouts and guided by countless hours of  
studying tape with running backs coach Bishop Harris, Smith is 
determined to prove that Buffalo made the right choice when it 
drafted the former University of Houston star in the first round in 
1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith, weighing in at 229 pounds, has the physical tools.  
Success will depend on how well he learns to use them, and how 
effectively he runs behind fullback Sam Gash, who last year helped 
Smith begin the transition from the one-back set. 
</P>
<P>
	``Last year was my first season with a fullback in front of  
me,'' Smith said. ``I was just of the mindset that I was going to 
follow Sam through hell or high water or wherever he went. 
Sometimes your fullback will lead you to the Promised Land, but he 
also draws a crowd.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Phillips, who eventually signed with the 49ers even though  
problems with the law, alcohol and weight cost him jobs with the 
St. Louis Rams and Miami Dolphins, was a threat to Smith's 
security. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wouldn't say the Bills were unhappy with me, but I haven't  
reached the full potential they saw when they drafted me,'' Smith 
said. ``It's kind of a wakeup call. This is a very important year 
for me.''

 *Nirad C. Chaudhuri    	
</P>
<P>
	OXFORD, England (AP) -- Nirad C. Chaudhuri, the Indian-born  
author and scholar who was acclaimed abroad but scorned at home, 
died Sunday. He was 101. 
</P>
<P>
	Chaudhuri made his entry into the scene of scholarly literature  
in 1951 with the publication of ``The Autobiography of an Unknown 
Indian,'' a memoir of his childhood in colonial India, in what is 
now Bangladesh. The thick memoir included lively, insightful 
descriptions of Indian customs, castes and relations with the 
British. 
</P>
<P>
	As a barefoot boy, he read Shakespeare alongside Sanskrit  
classics, and the memoirs were somewhat sympathetic to the 
unpopular 200 years of British rule. Critics called him the last 
British imperialist. 
</P>
<P>
	At the age of 90 he wrote a second 1,000-page tome of  
autobiography, ``Thy Hand, Great Anarch.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His last book of essays, ``Three Horsemen of the New  
Apocalypse,'' was written when he was 99. It was an indictment of 
what he called India's failed leadership and a lament for the 
decline of the country. He also concluded after 30 years in Oxford 
that England did not deserve itself. 
</P>
<P>
	He is survived by three sons, Dhruva, Kirti and Prithvi.

 *Reginald E. Kavanaugh    	
</P>
<P>
	EAST BRUNSWICK, N.J. (AP) -- Reginald E. Kavanaugh, a longtime  
court reporter for The Home News, died Saturday of a pulmonary 
embolism. He was 72. 
</P>
<P>
	Kavanaugh was a reporter at the newspaper for 43 years, 35 of  
which were spent covering the Middlesex County Courthouse. 
</P>
<P>
	Born in New Hampshire, Kavanaugh lived in several places as a  
child. He served in the Army during World War II. After the war, he 
returned to East Orange and graduated from Rutgers University in 
1951. While at Rutgers, Kavanaugh began working at what was then 
The Daily Home News of New Brunswick. 
</P>
<P>
	Kavanaugh won a National Headliner award in 1965 for writing a  
series of articles on drug use among young people, and also 
received awards from the New Jersey Press Association and Sigma 
Delta Chi. 
</P>
<P>
	He retired from The Home News in 1993.  
</P>
<P>
	Survivors include his wife, a sister, a niece and four nephews.

	SEATTLE (AP) -- Bastiaan J.D. Meeuse, a professor emeritus of  
botany at the University of Washington who researched a 
particularly malodorous type of lily for more than 50 years, died 
Tuesday of pneumonia. He was 83. 
</P>
<P>
	Meeuse wrote more than 200 articles on the voodoo lily, a  
relative of the ``corpse flower'' that came into rare bloom last 
month at the UW, and other plants. 
</P>
<P>
	He discovered a moss enzyme that oxidizes oxalic acid. Now the  
enzyme helps monitor blood in people who produce excess oxalic 
acid, which can cause deadly crystals in their kidneys. 
</P>
<P>
	But his passion remained researching the heat-and-stench  
generating pollination phase of the voodoo lily. 
</P>
<P>
	He once said the negative part of his choice was that his work  
would leave him with ``an odor that would drive skunks away.''

	TELLURIDE, Colo. (AP) -- Gregory Charles Minor, an engineer who  
quit General Electric's reactor division in the 1970s to protest 
nuclear power, died on July 20 of leukemia. He was 62. 
</P>
<P>
	Minor and two other middle-management engineers, Richard Hubbard  
and Dale Bridenbough, quit General Electric in 1976, saying they 
believed nuclear power presented a profound threat to mankind. 
</P>
<P>
	``My reason for leaving is a deep conviction that nuclear  
reactors and nuclear weapons now present a serious danger to the 
future of all life on this planet,'' Minor said at the time. 
</P>
<P>
	The three engineers, who spent most of their careers building  
reactors, testified before Congress that because they had become so 
specialized, they could no longer see the big picture. As a result, 
no one was in control. 
</P>
<P>
	The three engineers, championed by the anti-nuclear movement,  
founded MHB Technical Associates in San Jose, Calif., where they 
spent the next two decades conducting studies and testifying on the 
safety, reliability, construction and economics of power plants. 
</P>
<P>
	Minor, a native of Fresno, Calif., evaluated energy programs for  
federal agencies, foreign governments and public interest groups 
worldwide.

</P>
<P>
	BRYN MAWR, Pa. (AP) -- Gilbert Barclay Mustin, the president of  
Fleer Corp., one of the largest baseball trading card companies in 
the country and creator of Dubble Bubble chewing gum, died July 28 
of pneumonia. He was 78. 
</P>
<P>
	Mustin was the grandson of Frank Fleer, who founded Fleer in  
Philadelphia in the 1880s. The company made confections including 
Chiclets gum. 
</P>
<P>
	Fleer is believed to have invented bubble gum in 1928. Company  
accountant Walter Diemer is often credited with accidentally 
inventing the product, which Fleer sold under the name Dubble 
Bubble. 
</P>
<P>
	Mustin started at Fleer in 1949 and became its president in  
1959. By then, the company was in stiff competition with Topps, 
makers of Bazooka bubble gum. Topps dominated the baseball trading 
card business because the Federal Trade Commission had upheld 
Topps' exclusive contracts with major league baseball players for 
the use of their pictures on cards packaged with the gum. 
</P>
<P>
	Fleer, which had long sold trading cards of movie stars and  
other personalities with its gum, began a long antitrust suit 
against Topps in 1975. In 1983, the companies reached an out of 
court settlement that allowed Fleer to sell baseball cards but not 
with gum. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, Topps and Fleer are among the nation's largest baseball  
card companies. 
</P>
<P>
	Mustin retired in 1989, the year Fleer was sold to Marvel  
Entertainment. Fleer was sold again this year to a group of private 
investors and renamed Fleer Skybox of Mount Laurel, N.J.

</P>
<P>
	Posuvalyuk, a deputy foreign minister, died after a long  
illness, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported. 
</P>
<P>
	An expert in Middle Eastern affairs, Posuvalyuk joined the  
Russian diplomatic corps in 1964. He served in embassies in Yemen, 
Iraq and Syria before becoming Russia's ambassador to Oman in 1988 
and Iraq in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
	After returning to Moscow in 1992 to head the Foreign Ministry's  
Department of Africa and the Near East, he shuttled between Baghdad 
and Moscow in efforts to defuse several crises around Iraq, and 
took part in negotiations to advance the Mideast peace process.

<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Clint Youle, one of the first men to present the  
weather on television and a former Illinois legislator, died July 
23. He was 83. 
</P>
<P>
	Youle's television career began in 1948 when producers at NBC in  
Chicago decided to produce daily weather reports. He volunteered to 
use meteorology expertise he had gained during World War II and was 
first to present the weather on a national news program when he 
appeared on ``The Camel News Caravan'' with John Cameron Swayze in 
1949. 
</P>
<P>
	Youle, who became known as Mr. Weatherman, used a Rand McNally  
map covered with Plexiglas and marked weather systems using a black 
marker as he gave the forecast. But late in the 1950s, he found his 
time on the air was being cut short. 
</P>
<P>
	He retired from television in 1959.  
</P>
<P>
	Youle was elected to the Illinois Legislature in 1964. He  
received the second largest number of votes on the Republican 
ticket because of his name recognition, said his son, John. 
</P>
<P>
	Youle also owned several newspapers and worked as an investment  
banker. 
</P>
<P>
	He retired in 1977 to his family's 200-acre homestead in Scales  
Mound in Jo Daviess County.

<HEADLINE> Lee Denies Giving China Secrets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Declaring his innocence, the scientist  
suspected of passing vital U.S. nuclear weapons secrets to the 
Chinese said Sunday it was common practice for scientists to 
transfer secret information from classified to unclassified 
computers. 
</P>
<P>
	``The truth is I'm innocent,'' Wen Ho Lee said in an interview  
with CBS' ``60 Minutes'' aired Sunday. ``Suddenly, they told me I'm 
a traitor. ... I just don't understand this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Energy Secretary Bill Richardson, interviewed on the same  
program, said such a transfer, which would have made it easier for 
the Chinese to gain access to the information, was ``wrong and 
improper.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``He violated our national security procedure at Los Alamos as a  
government employee of the United States,'' Richardson said. ``This 
is something that we are not going to tolerate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lee was fired in the spring from his security sensitive job at  
the Energy Department's lab in Los Alamos, N.M., after he had been 
under investigation for possible espionage since 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Evidence emerged after his firing that Lee had shifted thousands  
of classified atomic weapons codes to an unsecured computer. 
</P>
<P>
	The Justice Department has not decided whether to charge Lee  
with any crime. 
</P>
<P>
	In the interview, Lee said he said he used three passwords on  
his unsecured computer so ``it's almost impossible for anybody to 
break in. You know, sometimes I even had a hard time to break in 
myself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked why he was singled out for the espionage investigation,  
Lee said his best explanation was that authorities needed a 
scapegoat and as a Chinese person born in Taiwan ``they think I'm 
perfect for them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lee, an American citizen since 1974, came under scrutiny after  
it became evident that the Chinese may have acquired secret design 
information about the W-88 nuclear warhead. Lee worked on that 
project and had made several trips to China. 
</P>
<P>
	Richardson denied Lee was being made a scapegoat. ``This man  
massively violated our security procedures at Los Alamos,'' he 
said, referring to improper contacts with Chinese officials and 
violations of security rules by his transfer of secret data to 
unclassifed computers. 
</P>
<P>
	The Los Angeles Times reported Sunday that a legal brief Lee's  
lawyers submitted to the Justice Department stressed that Lee had 
``used considerable care'' to protect the security of nuclear codes 
he moved to an unclassified computer. 
</P>
<P>
	His attorneys argued that Lee had good reason to transfer the  
files, because it was easier to work outside the classified system 
and the extra file provided a backup in case of computer 
breakdowns. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Orrin Hatch, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee,  
said Sunday that charging Lee with mishandling classified material 
might be appropriate because ``it is very difficult to prove 
espionage.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hatch, who is seeking the Republican nomination for president,  
also said on ``Fox News Sunday'' that the Justice Department 
mishandled the case. 
</P>
<P>
	Hatch, R-Utah, said Attorney General Janet Reno refused FBI  
requests for warrants against Lee even though the scientist had 
waived his rights and a warrant was not required. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's what really is mind-boggling to those of us who really  
look at this,'' the senator said.

<HEADLINE>  Mets Get Dunston for Paquette </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- The New York Mets picked up veteran infielder  
Shawon Dunston from the St. Louis Cardinals just before the trading 
deadline Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Dunston, who broke out of an 0-for-24 slump with two hits  
Saturday, is batting .307 with five homers and 25 RBIs in 150 
at-bats. He cost the Mets minor league infielder Craig Paquette, 
30, who was assigned to Triple-A Memphis. 
</P>
<P>
	``Dunston serves in a multi-purpose role,'' Mets general manager  
Steve Phillips said. ``He can come off the bench and hit. We look 
for him to be a nice veteran addition.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dunston, 36, wasn't happy as he cleaned out his locker with two  
of his children. He said he didn't know if he would join the Mets, 
his sixth team in three years, right away. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought I found a home here, but that's how it goes,'' he  
said. ``I'm not really surprised about this. It's not like it's the 
first time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dunston has been a shortstop most of his career, but has also  
played some outfield the last few years. 
</P>
<P>
	Paquette is currently with the U.S. Pan American team. He hit a  
two-run home run Thursday in an upset of Cuba in Winnipeg. 
</P>
<P>
	In six major-league seasons, Paquette has a career .232 batting  
average with 55 homers and 195 RBIs in 426 games. In 1998 he batted 
.263 in seven games with the Mets, and in 70 games for Triple-A 
Norfolk this year he batted .272 with 15 homers and 54 RBIs.

	RENO, Nev. (AP) -- Olivia Newton-John says her body was content  
to kick back and relax after her 1992 triumph over breast cancer. 
Her mind, however, didn't like running in neutral. 
</P>
<P>
	``I kept waking up at night with songs in my head,'' the singer  
told a sold-out casino crowd Saturday night.

cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm really very, very lucky. I treasure every day,'' she told  
a cheering audience that responded with three standing ovations. 
</P>
<P>
	The two-hour performance included her Grease-era hits like  
``Please Mr. Please,'' ``Have You Never Been Mellow?'' and 1974's 
``I Honestly Love You'' that she re-recorded on last year's ``Back

<HEADLINE> Saints Hope Karate Improves Game </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LA CROSSE, Wis. (AP) -- Randy White knows all about getting the  
upper hand in football. He used every edge he could on his way to 
the Hall of Fame. Now he's showing the New Orleans Saints how 
karate can improve their game. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are a lot of little things you need to take care of if  
you want to be the best,'' White said. ``This is just one more way 
to get an advantage. Football has turned more into a hands game. 
Everybody in the NFL uses their hands. The key is to be able to 
counter the moves used against you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	White, a former defensive tackle for the Dallas Cowboys, was  
elected to the Hall of Fame in 1994. He made the Pro Bowl nine 
times and was voted the MVP of the 1977 Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	He was introduced to martial arts in 1976 by the Cowboys'  
strength coach. 
</P>
<P>
	White found the discipline had a lot more uses than breaking  
concrete blocks to amaze his friends. He found it helped him deal 
with the 1976 rule change for pass blocking that allowed offensive 
linemen to use their hands. 
</P>
<P>
	``Randy is one of the best defensive linemen to play the game,  
and a lot of what he did was on his quickness, speed and the fact 
that he learned how to use martial arts,'' coach Mike Ditka said. 
``He was terrific at shedding people and when guys got their hands 
on him he had the ability to break them down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That's why White was back on a football field this week,  
grappling with players, slapping their arms down, stepping around 
guys 20 years younger and in much better condition. 
</P>
<P>
	White and Valentine Espiricueta of Applied Sports Martial Arts  
of Dallas use a variety of karate moves to show players how to 
offset the grabbing, holding and shoving that goes on in a game. 
They have shown their techniques to the Denver Broncos, Detroit 
Lions, San Diego Chargers and Cowboys in the past. 
</P>
<P>
	``It can help any player,'' said Espiricueta, a two-time full  
contact stick-fighting world champion. ``We teach them to get their 
opponents hands' off them and in a way that redirects his energy 
and makes him go a different way. It takes awhile to get it down, 
but the guys love it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	White, who remembers life in the trenches, thinks it's  
especially beneficial to defensive linemen. 
</P>
<P>
	``Basically, you're training your hands,'' White said.  
``Offensive linemen hold you, tackle you, they'll do whatever they 
can get away with. I don't blame them. The thing is, you have to 
come up with a way to defeat them and get your job done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although White and Espiricueta aren't teaching the Saints to use  
the knife-hand moves of martial arts, the quick slaps and chops 
they demonstrate resemble self-defense techniques. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's the same moves we use, the key to it is hand placement,''  
defensive end Jared Tomich said. ``If you can get their hands off 
you before they can lock onto you, you're going to be much better 
off. I wish I had known it earlier because it really is 
beneficial.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Defensive tackle La'Roi Glover, who led the Saints with 10 sacks  
last season, said the training has other advantages. 
</P>
<P>
	``It helps you build a mentality that you don't want anybody to  
put their hands on you,'' Glover said. ``Your hand-eye coordination 
gets better and it keeps you alert. I had a little martial arts 
training in college, but it's different learning from a Hall of 
Famer who can apply it to defensive line play.''

<HEADLINE>  Bills' Smith Loses Weight </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FREDONIA, N.Y. (AP) -- When Buffalo running back Antowain Smith  
heard that the Bills were taking a serious look at troubled 
Lawrence Phillips during the offseason, he got that sinking 
feeling. 
</P>
<P>
	Then Smith got moving.  
</P>
<P>
	He got up early to lift weights. He went running in the searing  
heat of Houston's summer afternoons. He peeled the skin off chicken 
and piled vegetables on his plate. 
</P>
<P>
	He shed pounds like winter clothes, but fear of losing the  
Bills' confidence stuck to Smith like a hair shirt. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were trying to tell me something,'' said Smith, who  
gained a respectable but unspectacular 1,124 yards last season 
while averaging what for him was a disappointing 3.8 yards per 
carry. 
</P>
<P>
	Message sent, message received.  
</P>
<P>
	Carrying a dozen fewer pounds than last year, a lean and wary  
Smith showed up for the start of training camp at Fredonia State 
over the weekend hopping lightly, cutting sharply and running like 
a man being chased by an assailant with a blowtorch. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel pretty good out there,'' Smith said.  
</P>
<P>
	He looks good, too, his teammates say.  
</P>
<P>
	``He's always had a lot of ability but now he's really starting  
to work to do everything that's asked of him,'' Bills fullback Sam 
Gash said. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith will be asked to do more than just run the ball, as he'll  
likely figure more prominently in the passing game. Last year he 
caught only five passes after making 28 catches as a rookie. 
</P>
<P>
	Propelled by rigorous workouts and guided by countless hours of  
studying tape with running backs coach Bishop Harris, Smith is 
determined to prove that Buffalo made the right choice when it 
drafted the former University of Houston star in the first round in 
1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith, weighing in at 229 pounds, has the physical tools.  
Success will depend on how well he learns to use them, and how 
effectively he runs behind fullback Sam Gash, who last year helped 
Smith begin the transition from the one-back set. 
</P>
<P>
	``Last year was my first season with a fullback in front of  
me,'' Smith said. ``I was just of the mindset that I was going to 
follow Sam through hell or high water or wherever he went. 
Sometimes your fullback will lead you to the Promised Land, but he 
also draws a crowd.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Phillips, who eventually signed with the 49ers even though  
problems with the law, alcohol and weight cost him jobs with the 
St. Louis Rams and Miami Dolphins, was a threat to Smith's 
security. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wouldn't say the Bills were unhappy with me, but I haven't  
reached the full potential they saw when they drafted me,'' Smith 
said. ``It's kind of a wakeup call. This is a very important year 
for me.''

to work to do everything that's asked of him,'' Bills fullback Sam 
Gash said. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith will be asked to do more than just run the ball, as he'll  
likely figure more prominently in the passing game. Last year he 
caught only five passes after making 28 catches as a rookie. 
</P>
<P>
	Propelled by rigorous workouts and guided by countless hours of  
studying tape with running backs coach Bishop Harris, Smith is 
determined to prove that Buffalo made the right choice when it 
drafted the former University of Houston star in the first round in 
1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith, weighing in at 229 pounds, has the physical tools.  
Success will depend on how well he learns to use them, and how 
effectively he runs behind fullback Sam Gash, who last year helped 
Smith begin the transition from the one-back set. 
</P>
<P>
	``Last year was my first season with a fullback in front of  
me,'' Smith said. ``I was just of the mindset that I was going to 
follow Sam through hell or high water or wherever he went. 
Sometimes your fullback will lead you to the Promised Land, but he 
also draws a crowd.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Phillips, who eventually signed with the 49ers even though  
problems with the law, alcohol and weight cost him jobs with the 
St. Louis Rams and Miami Dolphins, was a threat to Smith's 
security. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wouldn't say the Bills were unhappy with me, but I haven't  
reached the full potential they saw when they drafted me,'' Smith 
said. ``It's kind of a wakeup call. This is a very important year 
for me.''

<HEADLINE> Cowboys Adjust Without Sanders, Lett </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WICHITA FALLS, Texas (AP) -- The Dallas Cowboys are going through  
training camp without their two best defenders, Deion Sanders and 
Leon Lett. They better get used to playing without them. 
</P>
<P>
	Sanders is recovering from toe surgery and Lett is suspended for  
failing yet another drug test. The team has no idea when either 
will be back; there's a good chance neither will suit up before 
October. 
</P>
<P>
	So with their preseason opener a week away and the regular  
season beginning Sept. 12, all the Cowboys can do is wait. 
</P>
<P>
	``We just coach the guys who are here,'' coach Chan Gailey said.  
``We work with the things we can control.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sanders is with the team at Midwestern State University,  
continuing the rehabilitation on his rebuilt left big toe. He's 
allowed to jog straight ahead and he's even playing some 
basketball, which forces him to flex his toes and put pressure on 
them. 
</P>
<P>
	Sanders attends every practice wearing a red do-rag with  
``Jesus'' across the forehead. He walks around giving tips to the 
cornerbacks and occasionally helps on coverage drills by rifling 
left-handed passes. 
</P>
<P>
	``Deion, we've got to have you,'' a fan yelled to him Friday.  
``We're praying for you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Yet the Cowboys have no idea when he'll be back.  
</P>
<P>
	``We're all very curious,'' Cowboys owner Jerry Jones said.  
``It's looking good, but that's all we know.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sanders is the most vital piece of the Dallas defense. When he  
lines up at cornerback, quarterbacks ignore his side of the field, 
giving teammates a smaller area to defend. He's also the NFL's most 
electrifying punt returner. 
</P>
<P>
	Proof of Sanders' impact can be found in Dallas' record last  
year: 8-3 with him, 2-3 without him. 
</P>
<P>
	But Sanders needs his toes to be healthy for him to be at his  
best because his game is based on his feet -- quick cuts, flashy 
moves and breakaway speed. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need to make sure it's healed so we can have him for a long  
period of time,'' Gailey said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cowboys play twice in September, including a Monday night  
game against Atlanta in the second week. That prime time outing 
against Sanders' former club could be a target date. 
</P>
<P>
	But with Dallas off the next week, he's more likely to return  
Oct. 3 against Arizona, especially with the Cowboys trying to 
avenge a playoff loss to the Cardinals. 
</P>
<P>
	``If he comes back, then that's going to be a great, great  
plus,'' said Kevin Smith, who was benched last year but will start 
in Sanders' place. ``If he doesn't, we just have to get the job 
done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lett, the anchor of Dallas' defensive line, is suspended  
indefinitely for his third violations of the NFL's substance abuse 
program. His previous penalties were predetermined, but this one is 
up to NFL commissioner Paul Tagliabue. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cowboys are hoping to be Lett-less for only four games  
because that's how long Tagliabue punished the last three-time 
violator, Clayton Holmes. Under that time frame, Lett would return 
Oct. 10 in Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
	But two months after Lett's suspension, Tagliabue has yet to  
even say when he'll make a decision. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's nothing abnormal about that,'' said Jones, who had  
hoped to know before camp opened last week. ``It doesn't in any way 
cause me any more concern.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lett, who missed 19 games between 1995-97 because of  
drug-related suspensions, played in every game last season for the 
first time since 1994. Both years, he was picked to play in the Pro 
Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Myers is penciled in as Lett's replacement at tackle  
even though he played defensive end as a rookie last year. There's 
little depth behind him and fellow starter Chad Hennings. 
</P>
<P>
	``Not having Leon Lett is a takeaway as far as our team is  
concerned,'' Jones said. ``But I feel better after our first five 
practices than I felt coming to camp about what we're going to do 
if Leon is not playing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lett has returned from his previous suspensions in good shape  
and has always contributed immediately. Coaches hope that's the 
case again. 
</P>
<P>
	``If he gets here, when he gets here, we'll work him and try to  
get him ready to play,'' Gailey said, ``because we know what he can 
do.''

<HEADLINE> Novelist Murdoch's Brain Preserved </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- The brain of Iris Murdoch, the British novelist  
and philosopher who died of Alzheimer's disease in February, has 
been preserved and will be used for medical research, her husband 
said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	John Bayley, a former English Literature professor at Oxford  
University who has written a book about the deterioration of his 
wife's brilliant mind, said she had always wanted her body to be 
used for medical science. 
</P>
<P>
	The brain was removed before Murdoch, 79, was cremated. It is  
preserved in formalin at Addenbrooke Hospital in Cambridge, and 
will be used for research there and at the Radcliffe Infirmary in 
nearby Oxford where she was treated. 
</P>
<P>
	``One just hopes they will find a way of coping with  
Alzheimer's,'' said Bayley, 74. 
</P>
<P>
	Murdoch was diagnosed in 1996 as suffering from the disease  
which in its early stage she described as ``a very, very bad, quiet 
place.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Her 26 novels include ``A Severed Head,'' ``The Sea, The Sea''  
and ``Jackson's Dilemma.''

	Heat Wave Death Toll Reaches 150  
</P>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Medical authorities in Chicago will be examining  
the bodies of 20 people today to see if they are additional victims 
of a deadly heat wave. At least 50 people in Illinois have died as 
a result of the heat since the high temperatures settled in on July 
19. They're among at least 150 heat-related deaths around the 
country. Temperatures have cooled in the Windy City, with highs 
yesterday in the 80s and more of the same expected today. A city 
spokesman says there are still some lingering effects from the 
heat, including some power outages.

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The United States must make clear that Taiwan  
should not expect U.S. aid if Taiwan's unilateral moves toward 
independence provoke a Chinese invasion, Democratic presidential 
candidate Bill Bradley said today. Bradley, who is challenging Vice 
President Al Gore for the Democratic nomination, told NBC ``we 
would be there'' if China takes military action against Taiwan 
without a move toward independence. Separately, Bradley said he was 
``actually shocked that the Gore campaign attacked me so strongly'' 
after Bradley urged candidates for president to decline ``soft 
money'' contributions -- the largely unregulated donations to 
political parties.

strength of unity in the last stage of negotiations with Israel. 
But during their meeting in Cairo, it was clear it will not be easy 
to heal the rifts between PLO chairman Yasser Arafat and his 
rivals. Representatives of Arafat's Fatah faction and those of the 
Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine were upbeat after a 
three-hour morning session in Cairo, their first encounter since 
Arafat signed a peace accord with Israel in Oslo in 1993.

husband's rampage through the Atlanta area last week. He went on to 
kill eleven others, including his two children, before committing 
suicide. So far, two of the nine brokerage victims have been laid

<HEADLINE> Hatch Questions Judge Appointments </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A Republican presidential contender questions  
the selection of a President Clinton-appointed judge to try 
Democratic fund-raising cases against a Clinton friend and others 
that resulted in ``soft plea bargains.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, said Sunday he has no evidence of  
wrongdoing by U.S. District Judge Norma Holloway Johnson, the 
selecting judge, ``but this doesn't look right.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Associated Press, in a report Saturday, found that Johnson  
bypassed a traditional random assignment system to send the 
criminal case against presidential friend Charlie Trie to U.S. 
District Judge Paul L. Friedman. 
</P>
<P>
	Trie's case was the first major prosecution from the Justice  
Department investigation of Democratic fund raising in the 1996 
election. Friedman, appointed to the bench by Clinton two years 
earlier, also was assigned by Johnson two other related cases. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson used the same out-of-the-ordinary method to assign  
Clinton appointee James Robertson to a tax case involving another 
Clinton friend, former Associate Attorney General Webster Hubbell. 
</P>
<P>
	Hatch, taking a break from campaigning in Des Moines, Iowa, to  
appear on ``Fox News Sunday,'' complained that people involved in 
the fund-raising allegations ``undermined our political process.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Then all of a sudden you find, even in the local district  
courts, that there's been apparently selective assignment to two 
Clinton judges of some of these things,'' Hatch said. ``That really 
just kind of smells.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said he likes Johnson, ``and I have nothing to indicate that  
she's done anything wrong. But this doesn't look right.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Friedman threw out various charges against Trie and the other  
two, assigned to Friedman under normal court rules because of their 
cases' relevance to Trie's. 
</P>
<P>
	One of Friedman's rulings was thrown out on appeal, and Trie is  
to be sentenced, probably to probation, in two weeks on a 
plea-bargained guilty plea. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson, Friedman and Robertson have declined repeated requests  
by the AP to discuss the court assignments. 
</P>
<P>
	Hatch, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, often has  
criticized Attorney General Janet Reno and the Justice Department 
for decisions on whether to prosecute fund-raising matters or, when 
prosecution has proceeded, the quality of the cases developed. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of those implicated and charged have negotiated plea  
bargains and received light sentences. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if Reno's decisions were colored by politics, Hatch said:  
``They were certainly made either for political reasons or through 
incompetence or through advice from people ... who were 
political.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It looks as though they're covering these things up,'' Hatch  
said. ``Certainly it looks like these plea bargains have been 
deals, and we even worry about whether the judges were preselected 
so that they would give these soft plea bargains credibility.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Calls to the Justice Department Sunday were not immediately  
returned.

<HEADLINE> Casino Competition Rises in Detroit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- If there's a sign that competition has come to  
the market for Detroit's gambling dollars, it's the billboard over 
freeways leading into Detroit that reads ``Tax Free Winnings In 
Canada!'' 
</P>
<P>
	The ad campaign is one of several moves by Canada's Casino  
Windsor to entice the majority of its customers who come from the 
United States to keep making the trip to Windsor, Ontario, just 
across the river from Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
	Windsor and some of Michigan's Indian casinos are turning up  
their marketing efforts to lure customers back once the newness 
wears off the MGM Grand Detroit Casino. But the casinos are also 
counting on competition to grow the number of people coming to the 
Detroit area with a few bucks they're willing to lay on the table. 
</P>
<P>
	``Competition makes people much better at what they do,'' said  
MGM Grand Inc. Chairman J. Terrence Lanni. ``If you become a 
monopoly, you become fat, dumb and happy, and we don't want to do 
that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Casino Windsor has had a near monopoly on gamblers in the  
Detroit area since it opened in 1994 within a five-minute drive of 
downtown Detroit. In 1998, Windsor pulled in 20,000 customers a day 
and earned $535 million; 80 percent of those visitors were from the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Some gamblers who made it in to the MGM Grand opening Thursday  
said they were likely to cut back on visits to Canada. Henry Perry 
of Mount Clemens waited 4 1/2 hours to get in Thursday, just to feel 
the excitement of opening day. Perry said he's been to most of the 
casinos in Michigan and to Casino Windsor. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's about as good as any I've been to. Maybe even a few steps  
better,'' Perry said while waiting to play a slot machine. ``I 
probably won't go back to Windsor much. Here, you don't have to be 
bothered with getting your money exchanged.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Casino Windsor spokesman Jim Mundy said any decline in  
attendance will be temporary. 
</P>
<P>
	``We certainly expect to see a drop in attendance, as people  
check out MGM and see what it has to offer,'' Mundy said. ``But 
then there'll be a rebound.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mundy said Windsor offers more amenities -- a 389-room attached  
hotel, four restaurants, and space for live acts. 
</P>
<P>
	Perhaps more important, Mundy said, Americans benefit from using  
Canadian money because the exchange rate -- about $1.50 Canadian for 
every $1 American -- gives gamblers more to play with. 
</P>
<P>
	Casino Windsor's billboards have drawn some criticism from MGM  
Grand officials, who contend the message is misleading. While 
gambling winnings are not taxed in Canada, Americans who bring 
their winnings back must report them on their income taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	Mundy said the sign was not meant to mislead and is ``completely  
true.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With the arrival of MGM, the nearest Indian casino to Detroit,  
the Soaring Eagle Casino and Resort in Mount Pleasant, has also 
turned to Detroit freeway billboards for promotion and has started 
bringing in higher-tier entertainers, such as Ray Charles and Kenny 
Rogers, said spokesman Bill Masterson. 
</P>
<P>
	The casino in central Michigan is a 2 1/2-hour drive away, but  
offers a 512-room hotel, indoor and outdoor pools, an art gallery 
and even a child care center. 
</P>
<P>
	Like Windsor, Soaring Eagle has a size advantage over the MGM  
Grand Detroit, which is limited by the city to 75,000 square feet 
of gambling area. MGM Grand has 2,370 slots, while Windsor has 
2,947 and Soaring Eagle has over 4,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Masterson said MGM Grand is not a long-term threat.  
</P>
<P>
	``Whenever something new opens people are drawn to it,''  
Masterson said. ``We think over time, and even a relatively short 
period of time, our business will be back. We believe we're a 
destination resort, and it's based not on glitter and bells. It's 
based on arts and culture.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Experts disagree about Windsor's chances of holding onto its  
customers. Todd Jordan, an industry analyst with Raymond James &AMP; 
Associates Inc., said Casino Windsor would have a tough time. 
</P>
<P>
	``Location means a lot in this business, and unfortunately their  
location is at a disadvantage,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	But Bill Thompson, a professor at the University of Nevada-Las  
Vegas and a gambling industry expert, said Windsor would keep more 
than its fair share of a market where most of the gamblers live 
within 50 miles of Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think there's still a fear of going to downtown Detroit,''  
he said. ``People in Ann Arbor and Flint can get to Windsor just as 
easily as they can get to casinos in Detroit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Others say the increased competition could pay off for all  
players, as the region's gambling market grows to as much as $1.5 
billion a year. 
</P>
<P>
	``People go to Las Vegas and Atlantic City because they know  
there's more than one casino there,'' Mundy said. ``When people 
outside the immediate market hear there's four casinos in the 
Detroit-Windsor area, the market will begin to grow and it will 
become a gaming destination.''

<HEADLINE> Broncos Heading to Australia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- The Denver Broncos don't profess to know much  
Australian history. They're familiar mostly with the basics. 
</P>
<P>
	``They have kangaroos,'' quarterback Bubby Brister said on the  
eve of his team's Sunday night flight to Sydney, Australia, where 
the Broncos will play the San Diego Chargers in an exhibition game. 
</P>
<P>
	``Kangaroos, koalas and the Crocodile Hunter,'' tight end  
Shannon Sharpe said. ``That's about my extent on Australia.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The country that is home to celebrities such as Nicole Kidman,  
Greg Norman, Paul ``Crocodile Dundee'' Hogan and Elle MacPherson 
will play host to its first NFL game, the American Bowl, on Sunday 
at Stadium Australia. 
</P>
<P>
	Getting there doesn't promise to be half the fun.  
</P>
<P>
	The Broncos left Denver at 11 p.m. EDT, about an hour later than  
scheduled. They were flying 2 1/2 hours to Los Angeles before 
embarking upon a 14 1/2-hour flight to Sydney. 
</P>
<P>
	Because of the 16-hour time change, Monday will not exist for  
the players, coaches and accompanying entourage. They were 
scheduled to arrive in Australia on Tuesday morning. 
</P>
<P>
	It's an itinerary only Rip Van Winkle could love.  
</P>
<P>
	``They've told us when to fall asleep,'' defensive end Harald  
Hasselbach said. ``They'll come around and hand out sleeping pills 
if you want them, so by the time you get there, you're 
acclimated.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hasselbach, who has traveled to six continents, will be making  
his third trip to Australia. He was part of the Broncos' advanced 
scouting group that visited Sydney in April. 
</P>
<P>
	He also went Down Under in 1997 after winning a nationwide  
photography contest. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wanted to go because that was the only continent that I  
hadn't visited that's visitable,'' Hasselbach said. ``We loved it. 
Now that we're going again, I look at this as a tremendous 
opportunity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, how does a group of more than 100 people stay sane during  
17 hours in the air? 
</P>
<P>
	``Play cards, watch movies. That's about all you can do,''  
Sharpe said. ``I'll try to sleep, but I'm going to stay up for 
about 12 hours and aggravate everybody.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``He can probably do that,'' running back Terrell Davis said.  
``That's his trademark, being loud on the plane and waking 
everybody up. I hope they put my seat far from his.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Davis, the NFL's reigning MVP, figures to be one of the more  
talented players in Australia this week, but he won't be the most 
popular. 
</P>
<P>
	San Diego punter Darren Bennett is from Australia and the  
Broncos have agreed to sign punter Jon Ballantyne, an Australian 
who played in the NFL Europe League. 
</P>
<P>
	The pair, as well as curiosity, should help fill Stadium  
Australia, a 110,000-seat venue built for the 2000 Summer Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think they'll like it,'' linebacker Bill Romanowski said.  
``They're big on rugby over there. That's a tough game. You don't 
wear pads. I think they'll like the excitement and the hitting that 
football has to offer.''

<HEADLINE> Couple Just Missed Fateful Flight </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COTTRELLVILLE TOWNSHIP, Mich. (AP) -- Skydivers Bob and Caroline  
Johnson were running late and just missed joining their fellow 
parachutists aboard a weekend flight, and it saved their lives. The 
plane crashed, killing 10. 
</P>
<P>
	The couple, hosting relatives from Florida, showed up late for  
their skydiving appointment at Marine City Airport. They had 
planned to be on Saturday's first flight of the 1967 Beech King Air 
65A-90 -- which veered sharply shortly after takeoff and plummeted 
into a hayfield, exploding into a ball of fire. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a very sad day,'' Bob Johnson, of Rochester Hills, told  
The Detroit News for a report Sunday. ``It's the weekend when we 
all take off from everything else and come out and enjoy each 
other's company and be thankful for all the times we've had. 
</P>
<P>
	``We all know the risk, and it's something we expect. It's  
better than sitting home on the couch, scared of life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Federal investigators planned to remain at the scene for three  
to five days, then return to Washington, D.C., to continue to 
review evidence. A determination of the crash's cause could take as 
long as six months. 
</P>
<P>
	High heat and humidity can make it more difficult for a plane to  
take off. But there were no indications that they were the cause of 
the crash, said George Black, a spokesman for the National 
Transportation Safety Board. 
</P>
<P>
	It was 82 degrees with 69 percent humidity Saturday morning.  
</P>
<P>
	Engine failure does not appear to be a cause, but a final  
determination will wait for testing, Black said. 
</P>
<P>
	It appeared the plane had been properly loaded, an issue that is  
often to blame for small plane crashes, Black said. 
</P>
<P>
	Paul Myks, an experienced commercial pilot who had logged more  
than 9,000 hours of flight time, had prepared a manifest listing 
the weight of each jumper and piece of equipment, and appeared to 
have balanced the weight properly, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The plane did not carry a flight data recorder and was not  
required to do so, Black said. 
</P>
<P>
	The skydivers were part of a group called the Parahawks, who  
flew out of the airport about 40 miles north of Detroit. All those 
who died were veteran skydivers. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the U.S. Parachute Association, 32 people died  
while skydiving last year, one for every 100,000 jumps, The Detroit 
News reported.

<HEADLINE> Seahawks' Coach Holmgren Debuts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHENEY, Wash. (AP) -- The Seattle Seahawks got a quick  
introduction to Mike Holmgren's practice philosophy at Sunday's 
opening of training camp. 
</P>
<P>
	Rather than allow the team to ease into camp the first day,  
Holmgren interrupted proceedings midway through a morning session 
and explained to the entire team what he expects to see in 
first-and-10 situations. 
</P>
<P>
	The chat session illustrated the new Seahawks' coach's emphasis  
on detail and his willingness to take time out from practice to 
discuss his philosophy. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to explain to them what the drill was. I want to  
explain to them what I expect of them,'' said Holmgren, whose 
predecessor, Dennis Erickson, typically took a more hands-off 
approach in practice. 
</P>
<P>
	According to All-Pro defensive end Michael Sinclair, Holmgren  
has made a strong early impression on Seahawks players. 
</P>
<P>
	``When we first came to camp, he explained his philosophy,''  
said Sinclair, starting his ninth year with the team. ``He just 
said, `We're going to pay more attention to details. Because if you 
can't do the little things, then you can't play for me.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Added Ricky Watters, ``With coach Holmgren, we're going to be  
very disciplined.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But, Watters said, Holmgren's discipline also has a soft side.  
</P>
<P>
	``Coach Holmgren is always positive,'' the running back said.  
``Even when something goes wrong he's still positive about it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Holmgren, the former Green Bay Packers coach who took over in  
Seattle after Erickson was fired following an 8-8 season, is trying 
to get the Seahawks to the playoffs for the first time since 1988. 
</P>
<P>
	He liked what he saw Sunday.  
</P>
<P>
	``This was a good day. This is fun,'' he said. ``You see a  
little bit of the rust, but you also see great enthusiasm and great 
effort.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For Holmgren, seeing his players take the field was a reward for  
the months of preparations leading up to camp. 
</P>
<P>
	``Once we get out on the field, there's not a lot of  
paperwork,'' he said. ``It's just football, so it's fun.'' 
</P>
<P>
                              *Eagles    	
</P>
<P>
	The fans who booed him on the day he was drafted cheered Donovan  
McNabb on his first day of training camp with Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
	McNabb, taken with the second overall pick in the April 17  
draft, completed a hectic weekend with a strong first day of 
practice with the Eagles. 
</P>
<P>
	He and the Eagles agreed to terms Friday on a seven-year  
contract worth $54 million, but it wasn't until late Saturday that 
the 32-page contract was approved by the league offices and 
signed. 
</P>
<P>
                             *Patriots    	
</P>
<P>
	Rookie running back Kevin Faulk, being eyed to replace the  
injured Robert Edwards in New England's backfield, got his first 
taste of NFL-style discipline during morning practice. 
</P>
<P>
	After fumbling two punt returns, Faulk received an earful of  
instruction and got some hands-on attention from head coach Pete 
Carroll. The pair spent the next several minutes running through an 
intensive fumble-recovery drill. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, after Faulk dropped a screen pass from backup quarterback  
John Friesz, Carroll ordered the second-round draft choice from LSU 
to the sidelines, where he caught 50 screen passes from rookie 
quarterback Scott Mutryn. 
</P>
<P>
                              *Bills    	
</P>
<P>
	Carrying a dozen fewer pounds than last year, a lean and wary  
Antowain Smith showed up for the start of training camp hopping 
lightly, cutting sharply and running quickly. 
</P>
<P>
	Propelled by rigorous workouts and guided by countless hours of  
studying tape with running backs coach Bishop Harris, Smith is 
determined to prove that Buffalo made the right choice when it 
drafted him in the first round in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
                              *Saints    	
</P>
<P>
	Hall of Fame defensive lineman Randy White was back on a  
football field, grappling with New Orleans players, slapping their 
arms down, stepping around guys 20 years younger and in much better 
condition. 
</P>
<P>
	White and Valentine Espiricueta of Applied Sports Martial Arts  
used a variety of karate moves to show players how to offset the 
grabbing, holding and shoving that goes on in a game. 
</P>
<P>
                              *Giants    	
</P>
<P>
	After missing two seasons with what many felt was a  
career-ending injury to his right eye, Brian Williams, who still 
has trouble seeing when he glances down, is attempting a comeback 
to regain the starting spot he held from 1994-96. 
</P>
<P>
	``Barring another injury somewhere, I think he is the guy,'' new  
line coach Jim McNally said. ``I don't think he is going to 
disappoint us.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             *Dolphins    	
</P>
<P>
	In a spirited intrasquad scrimmage that featured a melee, rookie  
running back Cecil Collins vaulted to the forefront of Miami's 
overcrowded backfield. 
</P>
<P>
	Collins, the Dolphins fifth-round pick whose draft value dropped  
because of several off-field transgressions, rushed for 63 yards on 
13 carries, including a 40-yard touchdown off-tackle burst. 
</P>
<P>
                             *Packers    	
</P>
<P>
	Wide receiver Robert Brooks was missing from practice again amid  
speculation that he could be considering retirement. 
</P>
<P>
	After participating in Green Bay's first full-squad workouts  
Friday, Brooks, 29, was given Saturday off by coach Ray Rhodes 
</P>
<P>
	``My understanding is he's got a couple days to sit back and  
think about it and let Ray or Ron know what he's going to do,'' 
offensive coordinator Sherm Lewis said. 
</P>
<P>
	Brooks has said in the past he would retire if he was not  
completely healthy. 
</P>
<P>
                             *Vikings    	
</P>
<P>
	Minnesota, whose magic carpet ride last season overturned just  
shy of the Super Bowl, reported to training camp eager for 
atonement. 
</P>
<P>
	Some players said they'd use their 30-27 overtime loss to  
Atlanta in the NFC championship to fuel their fire for 1999. Others 
are trying to forget their 15-1 regular season romp that the 
Falcons rendered insignificant. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's the only way to describe it. We want to get that taste  
out of our mouth as soon as we can,'' said running back Robert 
Smith. 
</P>
<P>
                             *Steelers    	
</P>
<P>
	Dermontti Dawson suffered a mild sprain in his left knee and is  
expected to miss the next three to four weeks of the preseason. 
</P>
<P>
	Dawson was injured during a nine-on-seven inside drill less than  
one hour into the second practice session Saturday afternoon at St. 
Vincent College. The severity of the injury was revealed during an 
MRI performed Sunday morning. 
</P>
<P>
	Dawson, who has started 164 straight games for the Steelers  
since late in his rookie year, has opened all 160 in the past 10 
years at center. 
</P>
<P>
                              *Titans    	
</P>
<P>
	If nothing else, Tennessee will know how to get a play off  
without being called for delay of game. 
</P>
<P>
	The Titans were flagged for that penalty more often than any  
other NFL team last season. Coach Jeff Fisher has made fixing that 
tendency a priority in training camp. 
</P>
<P>
	A play clock was installed on the field, and the team worked on  
its timing during two drills in the first full practice of camp. 
</P>
<P>
                            *Buccaneers    	
</P>
<P>
	Tampa Bay will open camp without first-round draft pick Anthony  
McFarland after talks Sunday failed to produce a contract 
agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	General manager Rich McKay said he was ``perplexed and a little  
disappointed,'' that the team had not been able to finalize a deal. 
</P>
<P>
	McKay said talks would continue, but that he was not optimistic  
about having an agreement that would enable McFarland to join the 
team in time for its first practice Monday.

<HEADLINE> Heat Wave Death Toll Climbs to 150 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- The death toll from the heat wave that has  
scorched much of the country reached at least 150 as Chicago 
reported a spate of fatalities over the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	At least 50 people have died in Illinois since the wave began on  
July 19. Chicago Mayor Richard Daley reported 26 of those deaths on 
Saturday, and said an additional 20 deaths may be heat-related and 
were under investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, New York City ended the hottest July on record.  
</P>
<P>
	Other parts of the East continued to sizzle, too, with  
temperatures in eastern North Carolina soaring into triple digits 
Saturday for a record-setting eighth time this year. The 104-degree 
reading at Raleigh-Durham International Airport broke the 1983 mark 
of seven days over 100 degrees in a year. 
</P>
<P>
	Two cities in Oklahoma, Hobart and Tipton, hit 108.  
Greenville-Spartanburg International Airport in South Carolina hit 
a record high of 104; Louisville, Ky., and Parkersburg, W.Va., were 
at 102; and Columbus, Ohio and Columbus, Ind., both reached 100. 
</P>
<P>
	Philadelphia peaked at 99 degrees on Saturday, making it the  
ninth straight day above 90 degrees. 
</P>
<P>
	In New York, where temperatures had climbed above 90 for the  
last eight days, the thermometer ``only'' hit 88 degrees in Central 
Park. Forecasters were predicting that the first few days of August 
would offer some much-needed relief to the Big Apple. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest fatalities pushed the nation's overall heat-related  
death toll to 150, with many of the victims being found dead in 
homes and apartments without air-conditioning or fans. 
</P>
<P>
	The 50th death in Illinois was in the southern city of  
Metropolis, where a woman who died of heat exhaustion was found in 
the tub. Another death reported Saturday was a North Carolina 
migrant farm worker whose body temperature hit 108 degrees. 
</P>
<P>
	The heat and humidity also may have been a factor in a plane  
crash that killed nine skydivers and a pilot north of Detroit 
moments after take off, federal investigators said.

	STANFORD, Calif. (AP) -- The USTA has selected Stanford  
University's Taube Family Tennis Stadium for the Fed Cup final, 
which will feature the United States against Russia, on Sept. 
18-19. 
</P>
<P>
	The announcement of the site for the final round of the

<HEADLINE> Pistons To Sign Curry, Buechler </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUBURN HILLS, Mich. (AP) -- The Detroit Pistons are expected to  
sign free agent Michael Curry to a five-year, $12 million deal, 
according to newspaper reports. 
</P>
<P>
	The Detroit News reported in its Sunday editions that Curry, a  
small forward who played with the Pistons prior to spending the 
last two seasons in Milwaukee, was expected to sign a deal Sunday 
or Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	He's expected to receive the team's $2 million exception.  
</P>
<P>
	Jud Buechler also is expected to sign a two-year deal using the  
team's $1.1 million exception. Last season, Buechler was 10th in 
the league in 3-point shooting for the Pistons. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Pistons have a great opportunity (to sign Buechler),''  
said Mark Bartelstein, Buechler's agent. ``He had a great 
experience playing in Detroit last season. He loved playing for 
Alvin (Gentry) and with Grant (Hill). He really thinks the team has 
a chance to be good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Buechler reportedly has other offers -- one from San Antonio and  
another from the Lakers and coach Phil Jackson, who Buechler played 
for in Chicago for four seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	``He has a chance to make a little bit more money at other  
places, but he likes the idea that he can use the Larry Bird 
(exception with the Pistons) in a year,'' Bartelstein told the 
News. 
</P>
<P>
	If he re-signs with Detroit, Buechler will be eligible next  
season for the Bird exception, which means the Pistons could go 
over the salary cap to sign him to the league's average salary, 
which was $2.8 million last season.

	Mideast Peace Process May Be In Crisis  
</P>
<P>
	JERUSALEM (AP) -- A statement from Israeli Prime Minister Ehud  
Barak's office hinted that the Mideast peace process might be 
encountering its first crisis since he took office. Barak said 
today the Palestinians have not been flexible in peace 
negotiations, and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat summoned his top 
negotiators to Cairo for urgent consultations. A Palestinian 
official said a meeting today to discuss implementation of the 
U.S.-brokered Wye accord between Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat 
and his Israeli counterpart, Gilead Sher, ended in ``real crisis.''

	PBS To Halt Donor List Exchanges  
</P>
<P>
	PASADENA, Calif. (AP) -- PBS stations will halt all exchanges of  
donor lists with partisan groups within a week, but when the 
political fallout for public broadcasting might end is difficult to 
predict, PBS president Ervin S. Duggan said today. Of the 349 
public television stations nationwide, PBS has admitted that as 
many as 30 appear to have engaged in list rentals or exchanges with 
political groups. At issue is whether the list-swapping constitutes 
a violation of federal tax law.

	Lewinsky Hurt in Car Accident  
</P>
<P>
	VENTURA, Calif. (AP) -- Monica Lewinsky suffered scrapes and  
bruises today when her sport utility vehicle overturned on a 
freeway, the California Highway Patrol said. Lewinsky was alone 
when officers found her Ford Explorer on its side on state Highway 
101 about five miles north of town. She was transported to 
Community Memorial Hospital in Ventura, where she was treated and 
released. The cause of the accident remained under investigation.

	Colombian Rebel Army Kills 17  
</P>
<P>
	BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) -- Hundreds of guerrillas from the nation's  
largest rebel army launched a three-day attack on a police station, 
killing at least 17 people, including nine police officers and four 
children, police said today. Eight other police officers were 
wounded and seven more taken prisoner in the weekend attack by the 
Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC. The attack, which 
ended today, was one of the most deadly guerrilla assaults on 
civilians in memory.

</P>
<P>
	ABIDJAN, Ivory Coast (AP) -- Thousands of supporters of the Ivory  
Coast's second-largest opposition party elected a former prime 
minister today as their presidential candidate for next year's 
elections. Alassane Dramane Ouattara gave up his position last 
month as a top International Monetary Fund official to lead the 
opposition Rally of the Republicans. He was the party's only 
nominee for its top post, and he was unanimously approved.

	Kosovo Tension High After Explosion  
</P>
<P>
	PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Peacekeepers scrambled to keep a lid  
on simmering ethnic tensions today after a bomb damaged a Serbian 
Orthodox church under construction in Kosovo's capital. The blast 
early today did little damage to the structure, but it further 
undermined the already weak confidence of minority Serbs in the 
ability of the Western alliance's KFOR peacekeeping force to 
protect them from violence they say is committed by ethnic 
Albanians.

desire to please women that can be traced back to his childhood, 
according to The Sunday Times. ``He was so young, barely four, when 
he was scarred by abuse. There was a terrible conflict between his 
mother and grandmother,'' Mrs. Clinton told Talk magazine, 
according to the London-based newspaper, which said it obtained a 
copy of the interview.

	CHICAGO (AP) -- Though temperatures began to drop today across  
the Midwest, the death toll from last week's record-breaking heat 
rose even higher, with another 30 deaths here blamed on the heat 
and humidity. In much of the country, the worst had passed, with 
today's temperatures 10 to 20 degrees cooler across the Great Lakes 
and much of the upper Midwest. Chicago warmed to 81 by early 
afternoon, compared to a high of 104 on Friday.

<HEADLINE> Shania Twain Talks to Magazine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Shania Twain is actually pleased if a  
few people at her concerts don't enjoy the music. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, that's one requirement for becoming a security guard at  
the country entertainer's high-energy shows. 
</P>
<P>
	``We asked people if they were a fan of mine and if they liked  
my music. If they said no, we hired them,'' Twain tells Country 
Weekly magazine in its Aug. 10 edition. 
</P>
<P>
	``You don't want a security person watching the show. If they're  
too busy watching the show, they can't do their job'' said Twain, 
whose hits include ``You're Still the One,'' ``From This Moment 
On'' and ``Any Man of Mine.''

<HEADLINE> Trial of Dolphins Receiver To Begin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Jury selection was scheduled to begin Monday in the  
federal trial of Miami Dolphins receiver Tony Martin, who is 
charged with laundering drug money. 
</P>
<P>
	The charges stem from Martin's longtime friendship with Ricky  
Brownlee, who served seven years in prison for drug convictions 
during the 1980s. Although Martin's attorneys were seeking separate 
trials, District Judge K. Michael Moore denied the motion Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Martin, 33, was charged eight days after playing in the Super  
Bowl for the Atlanta Falcons. The Falcons later released him, and 
he signed a four-year, $14.2 million contract with Miami, his 
hometown team. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dolphins acquired Martin because they believe he provides  
the deep threat quarterback Dan Marino has long lacked. Plus, Miami 
took little risk in signing him -- all but $100,000 of his contract 
is contingent on him being available to play. 
</P>
<P>
	Martin reported to training camp Friday with other Dolphins  
veterans. During the trial, he plans to work out on his own in the 
evening, and he'll practice with the team on weekends. 
</P>
<P>
	The case against Martin centers on allegations that he helped  
Brownlee spend drug profits. Prosecutors say the money was used for 
three car leases, and they say Martin tried to pay $175,000 in 
Brownlee's attorney fees with money from Brownlee. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense attorneys say Martin didn't know the money was from drug  
sales. They say Martin never profited from the transactions and was 
motivated by friendship rather than criminal intent. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorneys anticipate a three-week trial, meaning a verdict would  
be reached three weeks before the Dolphins' first game Sept. 13 at 
Denver.

<HEADLINE>  Farmers Cheer End of Brit Beef Ban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- With open-invitation barbecues, British farmers  
celebrated on Sunday the lifting of a three-year ban on British 
beef exports imposed by European regulators after an outbreak of 
mad cow disease. 
</P>
<P>
	A supermarket chain offered free roast beef sandwiches to  
travelers arriving by train from France at London's Waterloo 
station, and government officials joined in some very public 
beef-eating before TV cameras at the barbecues. 
</P>
<P>
	But there is a long way to go to regain markets and try to  
re-establish confidence that British beef is safe, particularly in 
other European countries. 
</P>
<P>
	The embargo crippled Britain's beef industry, which lost an  
estimated $2.4 billion in sales. 
</P>
<P>
	``It won't happen tomorrow or the day after,'' said Tony Pexton,  
deputy president of the National Farmers' Union, who hosted a 
barbecue at his farm near Lancing, in West Sussex, southern 
England. ``But let's start fighting for our markets back again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Brussels-based European Commission, which enforces rules for  
the 15-member European Union, imposed the ban after a 1996 outbreak 
in Britain of bovine spongiform encephalopathy. 
</P>
<P>
	Medical reseachers say the disease, commonly known as mad cow  
disease, is linked to a fatal human brain ailment, 
Creutzfeldt-Jacob disease, which has killed 41 Britons. 
</P>
<P>
	EU veterinarians approved the end of the ban, but British beef  
still will be subject to strict precautions. 
</P>
<P>
	Meat must be de-boned and come from cattle born after Aug. 1,  
1996, when a ban came into force on the feeding to animals of meat 
and bone-meal. Meat from cattle more than 30 months old will not be 
exported. 
</P>
<P>
	The first consignment of British livestock to be exported for  
three years is due at a slaughterhouse in Cornwall, southwest 
England, on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The meat will be sent to France mid-August as the centerpiece of  
a marketing drive to persuade the French to buy British beef again. 
</P>
<P>
	Elliot Morley, a deputy Agriculture Minister in the Labor Party  
government, said the ban on sales of beef on the bone would 
continue until independent experts were convinced such meat was 
safe. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are not going to take risks with people's health,'' said  
Morley.

<HEADLINE> Book Chronicles Coastline Battle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) -- Sea levels are rising. Sandy beaches, the  
coastal gold standard, are more unstable than ever -- 70 percent are 
eroding. Jetties, seawalls, groins and dredging often only worsen 
beach conditions. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet all along the nation's shoreline, construction of pricey  
beachfront homes is booming, for Americans will not be denied the 
solace of sand and sea. Demographers predict that 80 percent of the 
U.S. population will live within an hour's drive of a coast by next 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	Cornelia Dean describes this alarming scenario in ``Against the  
Tide,'' a 239-page cautionary tale on the pitfalls of tangling with 
nature. The New York Times science editor describes the problems 
clearly in terms laypeople can understand. Her conclusions are 
sobering. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the long run, extensive development cannot coexist with an  
eroding beach -- and most American beaches are eroding,'' Dean 
writes. ``We Americans must reconsider our attitudes toward our 
beaches.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Experts in the field share her thinking. Renowned coastal  
geologist Orrin Pilkey of Duke University has long believed 
erosion-arresting measures are largely self-defeating and only 
encourage even denser coastal development. ``We now have thousands 
more houses at great risk than we had 20 years ago,'' Pilkey said 
recently. 
</P>
<P>
	Coastal areas are constantly being shaped by wind and waves,  
with tricky currents carrying beach-building sediment from one area 
to another. 
</P>
<P>
	Dean writes that currents are amazingly efficient transporters  
of sand. On North Carolina's Outer Banks, 700,000 cubic yards of 
sand per year migrate on currents along any given stretch of beach. 
Crucial details of the process remain a mystery. 
</P>
<P>
	Man's interference in the process with inlet dredging and  
jetties, and with other coastal ``armoring'' such as groins, 
breakwaters and seawalls invariably makes things worse, she says. 
</P>
<P>
	States have come to realize that hardened coastal structures,  
which protect 50 percent of the U.S. shoreline, are decidedly mixed 
blessings. 
</P>
<P>
	Jetties and groins, which extend outward from shore to trap sand  
updrift of them, starve downdrift beaches. Seawalls, which run 
parallel to shorelines, destroy the beaches they are designed to 
protect, Dean writes. 
</P>
<P>
	She describes how a groin field on the east side of a barrier  
island, Westhampton Beach on New York's Long Island, wrecked the 
west end. 
</P>
<P>
	She cites a 1989 study of 108 miles of New Jersey coastline that  
found beaches without stabilizing structures had 180 feet of beach 
and those downdrift of groins or jetties averaged just 60 feet; 
beaches fronting seawalls were only 29 feet wide on the average. 
</P>
<P>
	``At some point, the technological fixes employed to prevent  
shoreline retreat cross the line from resource management to 
vandalism,'' Dean writes. 
</P>
<P>
	New Jersey, notorious for its hardened coastal structures, now  
bars most new ones, as do North Carolina, Maine and South Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
	Along California's armored coastline, the beaches also are  
starving, but for different reasons. Dams and concrete-lined 
waterways prevent much of the sediment that previously fed those 
beaches from reaching the sea, Dean writes. 
</P>
<P>
	With no beach buffer, the cliffs of the Pacific shore are under  
constant attack. Cliffside homeowners are forced to build more 
beach barriers, which, in turn, accelerate erosion somewhere else. 
</P>
<P>
	Beach nourishment has become a common antidote. Dean says  
sometimes it works, but often it doesn't. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some projects, like Miami Beach, have lasted a long time,''  
she writes. ``But many more have washed away far more quickly than 
their designers anticipated.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Either way, beach nourishment is expensive. Folly Beach, S.C.,  
estimates it will cost $116 million to replenish 5.2 miles of 
coastline over 50 years. 
</P>
<P>
	``Against the Tide'' is leavened with spellbinding anecdotes. It  
opens with the disastrous 1900 hurricane in Galveston, Texas, that 
killed nearly 6,000 people. 
</P>
<P>
	There were so many dead, there was no place to bury them. But  
when barges took them to sea, the bodies washed ashore. So they 
were burned in beach bonfires. ``This work, so gruesome that men 
had to be forced at gunpoint to perform it, went on for weeks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Galveston's leaders vowed it wouldn't happen again. They raised  
the island's elevation and built a seawall. Galveston survived, but 
its beach, once the city's pride, is now gone thanks to the 
seawall. 
</P>
<P>
	The Galveston disaster and Hurricane Andrew's full-scale assault  
in 1992 on southern Florida and Louisiana illustrate the problems 
of coastal development in hurricane-prone areas, Dean writes. 
</P>
<P>
	Her solution is to build back from beachfronts and design homes  
so they might withstand a hurricane -- with reinforced windows, 
heavy-duty roofing nails and metal braces called ``hurricane 
clips'' to attach wall joists to roof beams. 
</P>
<P>
	Dean says beaches take care of themselves when man isn't in the  
picture. 
</P>
<P>
	``The best shore protection is a wide healthy beach,'' she  
writes. ``No amount of rock or concrete can make a beach wider. And 
nature always bats last at the coast.''

<HEADLINE> Indians Will Improve Without Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- The way John Hart figures it, the Cleveland  
Indians are on the verge of making several changes to improve their 
roster now that the trading deadline has passed. 
</P>
<P>
	How's that?  
</P>
<P>
	``We have some quality players just about ready to rejoin us,''  
the Indians' general manager said Sunday after failing to make any 
of the anticipated deals. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have Jaret Wright and Kenny Lofton coming back in a couple  
of days and Sandy Alomar in 10 days to two weeks. That should give 
us a lift,'' Hart said. ``We also look for Travis Fryman and Wil 
Cordero to rejoin the team in September.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hart said that he aggressively pursued talks with several teams  
-- but not just for any player. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the right guy was out there for us, we would have done  
something, believe me,'' Hart said. ``We kept looking for that top 
line pitcher.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hart said All-Stars Mike Mussina of Baltimore and Curt Schilling  
of Philadelphia were not available. 
</P>
<P>
	``We into all of this looking for a trade that would have helped  
us regarding our injuries or to bolster us for the postseason,'' 
Hart said. ``We talked to our medical staff first, then projected 
what our team would like like on October 1. We just didn't see any 
players available that would have been better than what we should 
have in October.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hart said he did talk with the Anaheim Angels about acquiring  
left-hander Chuck Finley, but thought the asking price was too 
high. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have developed a lot of good young players the last few  
years and other teams want them,'' Hart said. ``Well, so do we. I 
will say that in some of the deals we have made the last couple of 
years, other clubs have gotten some good talent, but we look for 
the best players to be coming back our way in any deal. Quite 
frankly, Finley's high ERA and lack of success this season were a 
concern to us.''

<HEADLINE> Lee Denies Giving China Secrets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A government scientist fired under suspicion  
he passed U.S. nuclear weapons secrets to the Chinese says he's 
innocent of espionage and that transferring sensitive information 
from classified to unclassified computers was common among his 
colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
	``The truth is I'm innocent,'' Wen Ho Lee said in an interview  
aired Sunday on CBS' ``60 Minutes.'' ``Suddenly, they told me I'm a 
traitor. ... I just don't understand this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Energy Secretary Bill Richardson said on the program that it  
was ``wrong and improper'' for Lee to have moved the information at 
the Energy Department's nuclear weapons laboratory in Los Alamos, 
N.M., to an unsecured computer. That would make it easier for the 
Chinese and others to gain access to the information. 
</P>
<P>
	``He violated our national security procedure at Los Alamos as a  
government employee of the United States,'' Richardson said. ``This 
is something that we are not going to tolerate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lee was fired last spring after being under investigation for  
possible espionage since 1996. He came under scrutiny after it 
became evident the Chinese may have acquired secret design 
information about the W-88 nuclear warhead. Lee worked on that 
project and had made several trips to China. 
</P>
<P>
	Evidence emerged after his firing that Lee had shifted thousands  
of classified nuclear weapons codes to an unsecured computer. 
</P>
<P>
	Lee said he used three passwords on his unsecured computer so  
``it's almost impossible for anybody to break in. You know, 
sometimes I even had a hard time to break in myself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He called the transfers of data a common practice by scientists  
at the lab. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked why he was singled out for the espionage investigation,  
Lee suggested that authorities needed a scapegoat and as a Chinese 
person born in Taiwan ``they think I'm perfect for them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Richardson denied that Lee, a U.S. citizen since 1974, was being  
made a scapegoat. ``This man massively violated our security 
procedures at Los Alamos,'' he said, referring to improper contacts 
with Chinese officials and violations of security rules by his 
transfer of secret data to unclassified computers. 
</P>
<P>
	The Justice Department has not decided whether to charge Lee  
with any crime. 
</P>
<P>
	The Los Angeles Times reported Sunday that a legal brief Lee's  
lawyers submitted to the department stressed that Lee had ``used 
considerable care'' to protect the security of nuclear codes he 
moved to an unclassified computer. 
</P>
<P>
	The attorneys argued that Lee had good reason to transfer the  
files, because it was easier to work outside the classified system 
and the extra file provided a backup in case of computer 
breakdowns.

<HEADLINE> Eagles Fans Cheer McNabb at Camp </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BETHLEHEM, Pa. (AP) -- Eagles fans booed Donovan McNabb on the  
day he was drafted. On Sunday, McNabb heard his first cheers from 
Philadelphia fans on his first day of training camp. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was rewarding to hear the fans cheer and clap for every  
completion that I had,'' McNabb said. ``They seemed to get excited 
about it. That helps out all the players.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McNabb, taken with the second overall pick in the April 17  
draft, completed a hectic weekend with a strong first day of 
practice with the Eagles. 
</P>
<P>
	McNabb and the Eagles agreed to terms Friday on a seven-year  
contract worth $54 million, including an $11.3 million signing 
bonus, but it wasn't until late Saturday that the 32-page contract 
was approved by the league offices and signed by McNabb. 
</P>
<P>
	With that behind him, McNabb stepped onto the field for the  
first time in training camp Sunday, intent on showing he was worth 
the high selection and big money. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it went well. Just coming out and I felt very  
comfortable throwing with the receivers and getting our timing back 
together,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	McNabb knows he has a lot of work to do.  
</P>
<P>
	``I don't feel like it's going to take me long to catch up,'' he  
said. ``I think the timing is pretty low right now. The receivers I 
worked out with (when he was unsigned) didn't have the speed or the 
route running that these guys have. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just an adjustment period that you go through when you  
report to camp. I'm patient and I'm just going to continue working 
on my conditioning.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Andy Reid gave McNabb plenty of practice reps, mostly with  
the second unit, behind starting quarterback Doug Pederson. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm glad he's in, I'm glad he's working,'' Reid said. ``We're  
catching him up on this thing. We're just working him right into 
the rotation. There were a lot of throws he had a chance to 
complete and they were either off the receiver's body or in a 
position where that receiver couldn't catch the football. 
</P>
<P>
	``The thing that I liked was, he finished strong. He came out  
and he was tired and that arm was tired and he worked that last 
series there and finished with some completions.''

<HEADLINE> Starr's Probers Asked About Sex </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Presidential friend Webster Hubbell says  
Kenneth Starr's prosecutors asked him for details about the 
Clintons' sex lives as well as his own. 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview with The New Yorker made public Sunday, Hubbell  
said the prosecutors seemed especially interested in speculation 
about Hillary Rodham Clinton and Vince Foster. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the inquiries were in connection with Starr's  
investigation of Foster's death in 1993 when Foster was working as 
a White House lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
	Three earlier investigations had found Foster killed himself  
with a shot to the head, and Starr's review agreed with that 
conclusion. 
</P>
<P>
	Hubbell did not return a telephone message left at his home  
Sunday. A spokesperson for Starr's office told the magazine that 
the office ``at all time asked relevant and proper questions. A 
professional and thorough suicide investigation always focuses on 
motives.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hubbell, a former associate attorney general, served 16 months  
in prison after pleading guilty to charges of bilking the Rose Law 
Firm, where Mrs. Clinton and Foster worked, and clients out of 
several hundred thousand dollars. 
</P>
<P>
	He now is on a year's probation for a negotiated guilty plea to  
tax evasion. 
</P>
<P>
	Hubbell said prosecutors ``wanted to know about Hillary's sex  
life. About the president's sex life, and mine, too. They 
specifically asked if Hillary and Vince had had an affair.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He added: ``I was surprised. For one thing, I think it's awful  
personal. And I don't think it's anybody's business.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hubbell said prosecutors asked him detailed questions about  
whether he had extramarital sexual relationships with specific 
women. 
</P>
<P>
	The magazine said Hubbell denied any affairs.

<HEADLINE> Texas May Execute 6 in Busy Spurt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HUNTSVILLE, Texas (AP) -- Up to six convicted killers could be  
put to death over two weeks in the busiest spurt of executions in 
Texas in more than two years. The first execution is set for 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Texas already accounts for more than a third of all the  
executions in the United States since capital punishment resumed in 
the late 1970s and is closing in on 200 lethal injections since 
convicted murderer Charlie Brooks ushered in the new death penalty 
era in the state in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
	The Texas count now stands at 180, including 16 this year.  
</P>
<P>
	The six convicted killers set to die this month are all longtime  
death row inmates whose confinements range from more than 11 years 
to more than 18 years. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every young man on death row should give thanks to God when  
they get an execution date,'' inmate Ricky Blackmon said in a 
recent interview with The Associated Press. ``If they wanted to 
punish me, that would be a life sentence. They're giving me a way 
out. I'm thanking God for it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Blackmon, 41, is set to die Wednesday for the robbery-slaying of  
a man stabbed and slashed with a homemade medieval-style sword in 
1987. All his appeals are exhausted, but any of those on Death Row 
could have their executions stayed. 
</P>
<P>
	Another six inmates already are on the execution schedule for  
September and October. It's possible this year could challenge the 
record of 37 prisoners put to death in 1997.

	CONCORD, N.H. (AP) -- The results of Iowa's straw poll of  
Republican presidential candidates should not knock anyone out of 
the running, former Vice President Dan Quayle said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not a make-or-break for me,'' Quayle said. ``I don't  
think it should be for anyone.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Quayle commented during a telephone interview as he wound up a  
campaign swing through New Hampshire. He said he is committed to 
being on New Hampshire's first-in-the-nation primary ballot next 
year despite his poor showing in recent telephone polls. 
</P>
<P>
	The Aug. 14 straw poll raises money for the Iowa Republican  
Party. Campaigns can buy $25 tickets for backers, and most are 
organizing bus caravans to bring in supporters. 
</P>
<P>
	Four years ago, straw votes were bused in from the rest of the  
Midwest, notably by Sen. Phil Gramm of Texas, who gained a surprise 
tie vote with the early favorite and eventual nominee, Bob Dole. 
</P>
<P>
	This year, Iowa Republican officials have limited voting to  
Iowans and said they will demand photo identification. 
</P>

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Former Connecticut Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr.  
said Sunday the Reform Party needs a strong candidate to challenge 
the political monopoly held for decades by Republicans and 
Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
	He's just not saying he's the man for the job.  
</P>
<P>
	Speaking Sunday on CBS' ``Face the Nation,'' the former  
Republican U.S. senator and independent governor once again brushed 
off talk of entering the 2000 presidential race. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm trying to push a third-party challenge to both the  
Republicans and the Democrats,'' he said. ``This isn't a personal 
ambition on my part, yet I know we can't really resolve our major 
problems until we give some competition to the monopoly that has 
been the Republicans and Democrats over the decades.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Weicker, who lives in Greenwich, Conn., has been considered a  
possible candidate since word spread that Minnesota Gov. Jesse 
Ventura, the Ross Perot-founded party's highest ranking elected 
official, was encouraging him to run. 
</P>

<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- More than 500 people turned out Sunday for a  
Long Island brunch to raise funds for the presidential campaign of 
Vice President Al Gore. 
</P>
<P>
	The event was held in 100-degree weather at the waterfront Sag  
Harbor home of Alma Brown, widow of Commerce Secretary Ron Brown. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought this would be a good occasion to make a speech on  
global warming -- not as many skeptics out there this day,'' joked 
Gore, dripping with sweat as he addressed the guests under a 
sweltering white tent in the front yard. 
</P>
<P>
	Sag Harbor is on Long Island's East End, a summer playground for  
the rich and famous. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the guests were former model Christie Brinkley; the  
chairwoman of the New York State Democratic Committee Judith Hope; 
and two members of Congress from Long Island, Rep. Michael Forbes, 
who recently changed his party affiliation from Republican to 
Democrat, and Rep. Carolyn McCarthy. 
</P>
<P>
	``He will be a tremendous president,'' McCarthy said. ``He is  
the first vice president ever to have not been hidden away and to 
have gained a lot of experience because of that. I'm happy that 
he's out here on Long Island. This is the beginning of a grassroots 
campaign for him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gore said that under the policies he and President Clinton have  
pursued, ``we are moving in a good direction of high living 
standards, low crime and more progress.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gore, accompanied by his wife, Tipper, told the group he was  
soliciting advice on how to be a good grandparent to his first 
grandchild -- a boy born July 4 to his daughter Karenna and her 
husband Drew Schiff. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he had been told that ``the preferred technique is to  
give the grandchild anything and everything he wants and if that 
causes problems give him back to the parents.''

<HEADLINE> Reds Put Pitcher Parris on DL </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- The Cincinnati Reds put starter Steve Parris  
on the 15-day disabled list Sunday and activated catcher Brian 
Johnson off the DL. 
</P>
<P>
	Parris missed his scheduled start Friday because of a strained  
triceps muscle in his pitching arm. He's been the Reds' most 
dependable starter, going 7-1 with a 3.45 ERA. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson had arthroscopic surgery to clean out his right knee on  
June 15. He has hit .275 with four homers and 15 RBIs in 27 games. 
</P>
<P>
	The addition of Johnson temporarily gives the Reds three  
catchers. Jason LaRue was called up from Triple-A Indianapolis to 
fill in for Johnson. Eddie Taubensee has caught the bulk of the 
games with Johnson gone. 
</P>
<P>
	The Reds will have to make a roster move Tuesday when pitcher  
Juan Guzman reports. The Reds traded two minor league pitchers for 
Guzman on Saturday night.

<HEADLINE> Cuban Defects at Pan Am Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WINNIPEG, Manitoba (AP) -- A Cuban track and field athlete has  
sought asylum in Canada, bringing to five the number of Cubans to 
leave the delegation during the Pan American Games. 
</P>
<P>
	Royal Canadian Mounted Police authorities confirmed Sunday that  
an unidentified athlete walked into their downtown office Saturday 
and said he wanted to defect. 
</P>
<P>
	The athlete, whom sources close to the Cuban delegation said was  
a member of the track and field team, was turned over to 
immigration officials. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither the RCMP nor the sources, speaking to The Associated  
Press on condition of anonymity, would reveal the name of the 
athlete. Track and field concluded Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Before the games began, pistol shooter Abel Juncosa Reyes asked  
for asylum. Reporter Lisette Cepero of Radio Rebelde also has 
sought to defect, as did a softball coach. 
</P>
<P>
	Another shooter, whom the Cubans say did not accompany the team  
-- sources say he did, indeed, come to Canada -- disappeared last 
week. The sources said he, too, was seeking to defect. 
</P>
<P>
	This latest episode came hours after the heads of the 42  
delegations to the games denounced agents they claimed were 
inciting Cuban athletes to defect. They condemned ``the negative 
actions that have affected not only Cuba, but all of the Americas, 
and have interfered with the Olympic movement and the spirit of 
equality and good sportsmanship.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last Monday, Cuban President Fidel Castro said: ``We have never  
seen so many tricks, so much filth in the Pan American Games. We 
are competing in enemy territory.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jose Ramon Fernandez, president of the Cuban Olympic Committee,  
said sports agents have been seen near the athletes village trying 
to contact Cubans and encourage them ``to desert.'' He said these 
agents are plying the athletes with offers of million-dollar 
contracts. 
</P>
<P>
	Fernandez also has criticized media coverage of the defections,  
claiming the media had worsened the situation with its reporting.

<HEADLINE> McDonald's Is Big Employer in Brazil </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) -- McDonald's has become the biggest  
non-government employer in Brazil with 33,000 workers, surpassing 
Volkswagen and local supermarket chain Pao de Acucar which 
previously held the title, newsweekly Veja reported Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The only companies with more employers are state oil giant  
Petrobras and the government-run post office chain Correios, said 
the magazine. 
</P>
<P>
	McDonald's Corp., the world's largest fast-food chain, opened  
its first restaurant in Brazil in 1979 and it now has 470 branches, 
the newsweekly said. Workers earn an average of $348 per month and 
90 percent are under age 21.

<HEADLINE> Russian Says Country Needs Food Aid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- A Russian grain official has called on the  
government to appeal to the West for food aid now, even before the 
1999 harvest is in, the Interfax news agency reported Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Leonid Chesinsky, the president of the Roskhlebprodukt bakery  
company, said that corporate grain experts expect this year's 
harvest, which has been blighted by drought, would bring just 50-55 
million tons. That is about 15-20 tons short of demand. 
</P>
<P>
	He said that the state would have to import some 14-15 million  
tons of grain just for human bread consumption. 
</P>
<P>
	``But if the government intends to revive livestock and poultry  
breeding in this country, grain imports must far exceed this 
figure,'' Interfax quoted him as saying. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year's poor grain harvest of 48 million tons forced the  
government to ask for food aid from the United States and the 
European Union.

<HEADLINE> Two Quakes Jolt Las Vegas Casinos </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- Two moderate earthquakes jolted the remote  
Nevada desert on Sunday, shaking Las Vegas casinos miles away and 
prompting telephone calls from worried tourists and residents. 
</P>
<P>
	No damage or injuries were reported.  
</P>
<P>
	A magnitude-5.6 quake near the California-Nevada border struck  
at 9:06 a.m., followed 21 minutes later by a magnitude-5.2 shaker, 
said Pat Jorgenson of the U.S. Geological Survey. 
</P>
<P>
	The epicenters were 130 miles northwest of Las Vegas along a  
remote, sparsely inhabited border area east of California's Death 
Valley National Park, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's two pretty strong shakers. Maybe a few things would  
have fallen off shelves,'' Jorgenson said. It wasn't known on which 
fault the quakes were centered, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Several Las Vegas high-rise hotels reported calls from guests  
wondering what was happening. 
</P>
<P>
	A security guard at the Stratosphere Hotel and Tower, who asked  
that his name not be used, said that several people called, 
including an employee at the top of the 1,149-foot tower who 
reported ``a little vibration.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Employees at the Las Vegas Hilton and the Mirage also reported  
guests calling to ask about the movement, but said the resort 
sustained no damage and no injuries to any guests or employees. 
</P>
<P>
	Clark County Aviation Director Randy Walker said employees in  
the control tower at McCarran International Airport felt movement 
at the time of the quake but nothing was shut down. ``It wasn't 
something people got overly concerned about,'' Walker said. 
</P>
<P>
	A Las Vegas Metropolitan police dispatcher who requested  
anonymity said dispatchers had received ``quite a few calls'' but 
no reports of damage or injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	``The callers were just trying to figure out what had  
happened,'' the dispatcher said. ``They reported things shaking and 
plants swinging.''

<HEADLINE> Heat Breaks in Much of Midwest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Though temperatures began to drop Sunday across  
the Midwest, the death toll from last week's record-breaking heat 
rose even higher, with another 30 deaths here blamed on the heat 
and humidity. 
</P>
<P>
	In much of the country, the worst had passed, with Sunday's  
temperatures 10 to 20 degrees cooler across the Great Lakes and 
much of the upper Midwest. Chicago warmed to 81 by early afternoon, 
compared to a high of 104 on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	But 50 more bodies were brought to the Cook County morgue from  
Friday to Sunday, said city Health Commissioner John Wilhelm, and 
officials expected the death toll to rise. A refrigerated trailer 
was brought in to store bodies until autopsies could be done. 
</P>
<P>
	The new deaths added Sunday brought the Illinois total to 80 and  
the nationwide number to at least 185 since July 19. 
</P>
<P>
	But for parts of the country that were sweltering a day or two  
ago, Sunday brought relief. 
</P>
<P>
	The temperature was an almost crisp 59 degrees when Bill Hansche  
left for work early Sunday at the Maple Grove County Club in West 
Salem, Wis., a sharp change from afternoon temperatures that peaked 
at 100 on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Today, it's just perfect,'' Hansche said. ``I wish you could  
box these up and bring one out every day you need one.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Louisville, Ky., the afternoon temperature was down to 78 --  
from a high of 104 on Friday and 99 on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	While the cooler air pressed slowly toward the east and south,  
heat advisories and warnings also remained in effect for areas 
scattered from Oklahoma and Arkansas to Georgia and the Carolinas, 
the National Weather Service said. 
</P>
<P>
	Three heat-related deaths had been reported in North Carolina,  
where the early afternoon temperature at Raleigh-Durham 
International Airport was a record-breaking 104, the third 
consecutive day of temperatures over 100. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's hotter here than south Louisiana, where we moved from,''  
said Raymond Rodgers as he stood in the sun painting outdoor 
furniture with his 14-year-old daughter in Raleigh. 
</P>
<P>
	The cold front isn't expected to arrive in Alabama until Monday.  
Sunday's heat index -- a combination of temperature and humidity -- 
was forecast at 110. 
</P>
<P>
	Sixty-eight of Illinois' deaths were in Chicago's Cook County,  
and while city Health Commissioner John Wilhelm expected the number 
to go higher, he said the latest heat wave is not a repeat of 
1995's deadly weather. 
</P>
<P>
	The heat wave of 1995 contributed to more than 700 Chicago-area  
deaths. While city officials said they've learned many lessons 
about helping elderly and other vulnerable residents handle the 
heat, Mayor Richard M. Daley said people have to take 
responsibility for checking up on loved ones. 
</P>
<P>
	``Why don't family members check on other family members and  
parents?'' Daley said. ``Why are they calling the city to do that? 
That is the most frustrating thing in any crisis.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But for the Folak family on Chicago's North Side, it was  
frustrating to learn that their concern for a longtime tenant 
couldn't save him from the extreme temperatures. 
</P>
<P>
	The body of Eddie Slautas was discovered Friday night in the  
apartment where he lived for 70 years, above a tavern owned by Bill 
and Sandy Folak. 
</P>
<P>
	Slautas, who would have turned 75 on Sunday, had several fans  
but refused the Folaks' offer of an air conditioner, Sandy Folak 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``He said, 'Why should I make my electric bill higher. The fan  
is good enough,''' she said.

<HEADLINE> Trial of Dolphins Receiver To Begin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Jury selection was scheduled to begin Monday in the  
federal trial of Miami Dolphins receiver Tony Martin, who is 
charged with laundering drug money. 
</P>
<P>
	The charges stem from Martin's longtime friendship with Ricky  
Brownlee, who served seven years in prison for drug convictions 
during the 1980s. Although Martin's attorneys were seeking separate 
trials, District Judge K. Michael Moore denied the motion Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Martin, 33, was charged eight days after playing in the Super  
Bowl for the Atlanta Falcons. The Falcons later released him, and 
he signed a four-year, $14.2 million contract with Miami, his 
hometown team. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dolphins acquired Martin because they believe he provides  
the deep threat quarterback Dan Marino has long lacked. Plus, Miami 
took little risk in signing him -- all but $100,000 of his contract 
is contingent on him being available to play. 
</P>
<P>
	Martin reported to training camp Friday with other Dolphins  
veterans. During the trial, he plans to work out on his own in the 
evening, and he'll practice with the team on weekends. 
</P>
<P>
	The case against Martin centers on allegations that he helped  
Brownlee spend drug profits. Prosecutors say the money was used for 
three car leases, and they say Martin tried to pay $175,000 in 
Brownlee's attorney fees with money from Brownlee. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense attorneys say Martin didn't know the money was from drug  
sales. They say Martin never profited from the transactions and was 
motivated by friendship rather than criminal intent. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorneys anticipate a three-week trial, meaning a verdict would  
be reached three weeks before the Dolphins' first game Sept. 13 at 
Denver.

<HEADLINE> Jets Try To Plug Holes in Line </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HEMPSTEAD, N.Y. (AP) -- The New York Jets, surprised when veteran  
offensive lineman Erik Norgard walked out of camp a day ago, filled 
that roster spot Sunday with free-agent guard Ian Beckles. 
</P>
<P>
	The 6-foot-1, 305-pound Beckles, a 10-year veteran, is expected  
to step in immediately as the starter at right guard ahead of 
second-round draft pick Randy Thomas of Mississippi State. 
</P>
<P>
	Beckles, a former Philadelphia Eagles starter, was given a  
one-year contract. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think I have some good years left in me,'' said Beckles, 32.  
``I'm coming here to start. I've never come off the bench before. 
If I am used as a backup, it means I didn't do my job.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Jets' offensive line has been a major focal point for coach  
Bill Parcells during the offseason. After waiving left guard Todd 
Burger and allowing right guard Matt O'Dwyer to leave as a free 
agent, Parcells signed Norgard, a former Oilers starter, to a 
three-year, $2.4 million deal. Parcells also took three guards in 
this year's draft. 
</P>
<P>
	Beckles, who has started 122 of his 127 career games, played for  
Tampa Bay from 1990-96 and Philadelphia the past two seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a veteran and we're going to put him in there and see  
what he can do. We had him in during the offseason to talk to him. 
He's going to have to come in and show me that he can do it,'' 
Parcells said. 
</P>
<P>
	Second-year player Doug Karczewski and rookie David Loverne, a  
third-round selection, are battling for the starting left guard 
position. 
</P>
<P>
	Following Saturday's morning practice, Norgard notified Parcells  
that he had chosen to give up football.

	White House Touts Welfare Changes  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- All 50 states have moved the required number  
of people from welfare to work, the White House said today, noting 
that 35 percent of the nation's welfare recipients held jobs in 
1998. The president plans to promote those numbers on Tuesday at a 
welfare-to-work conference in Chicago, and use them to make the 
case for Congress to provide funding for services, such as child 
care, to aid the welfare-to-work transition.

	LONDON (AP) -- First lady Hillary Rodham Clinton, in a magazine

desire to please women that can be traced back to his childhood, 
according to The Sunday Times. ``He was so young, barely four, when 
he was scarred by abuse. There was a terrible conflict between his 
mother and grandmother,'' Mrs. Clinton told Talk magazine, 
according to the London-based newspaper, which said it obtained a

accord might begin within a month, a cabinet statement said. The 
statement did not specify when withdrawals from the West Bank would 
begin, but a Barak spokesman said the ``physical implementation'' 
of the agreement would begin Oct. 1. More delays would likely anger 
the Palestinians, who have called for immediate implementation of 
the U.S.-brokered Wye River accord.

	COTTRELLVILLE TOWNSHIP, Mich. (AP) -- Lateness saved the lives of  
skydivers Bob and Caroline Johnson who just missed joining their 
fellow parachutists aboard a flight that crashed, killing 10. The 
couple showed up late for yesterday's first flight of the 1967 
Beech King Air 65A-90 which veered sharply shortly after takeoff 
and plummeted into a hayfield, exploding into a ball of fire.

	BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) -- Hundreds of leftist rebels launched a  
three-day attack on a police station with homemade missiles and 
automatic weapons, killing at least nine officers and destroying 
nearby homes and businesses, police said today. Eight police were 
wounded, and 11 more feared taken prisoner in the weekend attack, 
which ended today. Leftist Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia 
on Friday began ravaging the small town of Narino, 100 miles 
northwest of Bogota in the state of Antioquia.

	PRIDDIS, Alberta (AP) -- Karrie Webb staged a dramatic comeback  
on the back nine of Priddis Greens today for a 6-under 66 to win 
the du Maurier Classic, her first major championship. Starting the 
final round five strokes back, Webb followed crucial par saves with 
birdies on three of the last four holes to finish at 11-under 277 
for a two-stroke victory over Laura Davies. Juli Inkster's bid to 
win her third-straight major championship and a berth in the LPGA 
Hall of Fame never materialized.

	STANFORD, Calif. (AP) -- Lindsay Davenport used power to control  
the match against Venus Williams and win 7-6 (7-1), 6-2 today in 
the final of the Bank of the West Classic for the second-straight 
year. Davenport, who has won eight of nine matches against 
Williams, had defeated her 6-4, 5-7, 6-4 in this tournament's final 
last year. Davenport used that win as a springboard toward the U.S. 
Open title and the No. 1 ranking.

<HEADLINE> Celtics Sign Guard Adrian Griffin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Adrian Griffin, the most valuable player in the  
CBA last season, agreed to terms Sunday with the Boston Celtics. 
</P>
<P>
	``Adrian did this the old-fashioned way -- he earned  
everything,'' said Celtics coach Rick Pitino said. ``We were 
looking for a player who could come off the bench and score, and 
Adrian fills that need for us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 25-year-old guard-forward Adrian Griffin played college ball  
at Seton Hall. The 6-foot-5, 220-pounder played one season 
professionally in Italy before spending three seasons with the 
Connecticut Pride of the Continental Basketball Association. 
</P>
<P>
	Griffith has been one of Boston's best players in summer league  
action. The Celtics carried an overall 13-0 summer record into 
their game Sunday against Seattle at UMass-Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	He is expected to take one of the roster spots vacated by Bruce  
Bown, Marlon Garnett and Eric Riley, all of whom are free agents.

<HEADLINE> Virtual City Offers Vision of L.A. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Bill Jepson drives through a canyon of  
skyscrapers under a partly cloudy sky, passing the shiny black 
tubular towers of the landmark Bonaventure Hotel, concrete office 
buildings, neon-lit shops and posh apartments. 
</P>
<P>
	But the landscape disappears when he wanders south of 9th  
Street. No buildings. No roads. No people. 
</P>
<P>
	The void doesn't worry Jepson -- his digital construction workers  
just haven't finished building that neighborhood on the powerful 
machines in their computer lab. 
</P>
<P>
	Using bits instead of bricks, the Virtual L.A. team is slowly  
rebuilding the City of Angels to within inches of accuracy. Once an 
area is finished, it can be walked, driven or flown through just as 
freely and realistically as in the real world. 
</P>
<P>
	The availability of high-powered databases and software has led  
to projects like Virtual L.A. in several cities, including Berlin, 
Philadelphia and San Francisco. They could revolutionize urban 
planning, emergency preparedness and tourism, developers say. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's really an information system, not just a visualization  
system,'' said Jepson, leader of the Urban Simulation Laboratory 
and Virtual L.A. at the University of California, Los Angeles. ``We 
use the digital metaphor of the 3D world around us as a way of 
locating information.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Virtual L.A. sounds like a video game or flight simulator, but  
it's much more detailed, realistic and interactive. Layers of 
information from floor plans to restaurant menus to Web pages can 
be linked to any building or other objects inside the massive 
database. 
</P>
<P>
	Though only 20 of Los Angeles 465 square miles have been  
reconstructed at a cost of anywhere from $4,000 to $12,000 a block, 
the technology has already attracted the attention of firefighters, 
police departments, architects and urban planners. 
</P>
<P>
	``The opportunity is the integration of all the data and  
knowledge about a city,'' said Bernard Pailthorpe, director of 
scientific visualization at the San Diego Supercomputer Center. 
More information can lead to better decision-making, he added. 
</P>
<P>
	In Santa Monica, residents who live near a UCLA hospital project  
were worried that a large parking garage planned for their 
neighborhood would become an eyesore. Virtual L.A. showed them 
exactly how it would look, and trees and shrubs were added to 
alleviate concerns. 
</P>
<P>
	``We came up with a better solution and short-circuited the  
problem by several months,'' Jepson said. ``Neighbors could look at 
it and understand exactly what it is.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Emergency planners, firefighters and police want to use the  
technology to create realistic training simulators modeled off real 
terrain. Or they can test plans to respond to real-time disaster 
without risking lives. 
</P>
<P>
	``With a tool like this, we can sit in one location and do  
modeling on how we're going to respond to a particular situation,'' 
said Ellis Stanley, emergency manager for Los Angeles. It shows 
``your exposures, what you can expect in this building, the terrain 
around it, the fire hydrants.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tourists also could navigate a city before stepping foot in it.  
Inside a car, a computer could superimpose a route onto a screen 
just as a driver travels through the area. 
</P>
<P>
	The Virtual L.A. team has been adding streets, freeways and  
other details to the system for seven years. Within the next 
decade, all of Southern California, from Santa Barbara to San 
Diego, should be modeled. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't know if our clients want to turn right or turn left,  
fly up in the air, look down or whatever,'' Jepson said. ``We have 
to build everything.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It can be a tedious process. Student assistants first draw  
simple white shapes and then electronically paste pictures on them. 
The computer alters the perspective as a location is viewed from 
different angles. 
</P>
<P>
	The challenge of the project is not only recreating the city but  
finding a way to store and unload the data. And while today's home 
computers are becoming stronger and faster, the machines needed to 
process such information won't hit store shelves for a few more 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	Virtual L.A. will eventually become accessible via the Internet.  
The National Science Foundation is funding research into ways of 
efficiently moving the information from database to networked 
computers. 
</P>
<P>
	Layers of information then could be added by anyone, from the  
architects to property owners to the people who live and work in 
the buildings. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we're trying to do here is provide an overall structure  
so it all fits together and works together,'' said UCLA computer 
science professor Richard Muntz, who is developing the Virtual L.A. 
database.

<HEADLINE> Patch Could Alter Aneurysm Surgery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- George Huffman had a time bomb in his abdomen:  
A weak bulging spot on the largest blood vessel in his body that, 
if it broke, would cause almost instantly fatal internal bleeding. 
</P>
<P>
	Surgery to patch that artery, the aorta, is among the most  
grueling operations known -- the entire abdomen is sliced open and 
delicate organs moved aside just to reach the problem spot. Surgery 
kills up to 10 percent of patients, and even those who do well can 
require months of recuperation. 
</P>
<P>
	Hoping to avoid traumatic surgery, Huffman volunteered to have  
an experimental patch, as thick as his index finger, threaded up 
his body through an artery in his leg. It worked. The Hickory, 
N.C., lawyer spent just one night in the hospital, and a week later 
was back at work. 
</P>
<P>
	Thousands of Americans with abdominal aortic aneurysms soon may  
get to opt for Huffman's easier therapy. 
</P>
<P>
	The first minimally invasive treatments, competing surgical  
devices made by Guidant Corp. and Medtronic Inc., are awaiting 
final Food and Drug Administration review after government advisers 
last month recommended their approval. 
</P>
<P>
	They will not be for everyone -- indeed, FDA's advisers worried  
the new devices may be dangerous for certain women -- and surgeons 
need careful training in the extremely difficult procedure. 
</P>
<P>
	But some surgeons say the devices could revolutionize care,  
particularly for elderly patients who could not survive regular 
surgery and today have no options. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's really a quantum leap in terms of therapy,'' said Dr.  
David Deaton of East Carolina University, who helped test Guidant's 
device. ``This technique is in its infancy and it's already clearly 
better, for the right patient.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors estimate that 1.5 million older Americans have abdominal  
aortic aneurysms, called ``AAAs.'' But because AAAs often cause no 
symptoms until the lifethreatening day they break, only about 
200,000 patients are aware of the problem. 
</P>
<P>
	The aorta is the largest blood vessel, like a river running from  
the heart to the groin with tributaries that branch off carrying 
blood around the body. 
</P>
<P>
	An aneurysm is a weak bulge in the aorta's wall. As blood pounds  
past, the pressure can cause that balloon-like spot to burst -- 
killing 15,000 Americans a year. 
</P>
<P>
	Aneurysms big enough to risk bursting require surgery to patch  
them. 
</P>
<P>
	The experimental alternative to that grueling operation: slice  
an opening into an artery in the groin; thread the aortic patch up 
that artery until it meets the aorta; then push the patch to the 
aneurysm spot. 
</P>
<P>
	The patch must extend like a sleeve inside the aorta, providing  
a new path so blood does not continue to pressure the weakened 
aorta wall. 
</P>
<P>
	Guidant's patch, Ancure, has little metal hooks that grab onto a  
healthy section of aorta to form that sleeve. 
</P>
<P>
	Medtronic's AneuRx is a stent, a metal scaffolding that opens up  
until it has expanded against the aortic walls enough to hold the 
patch in place. 
</P>
<P>
	In clinical trials of about 800 patients, the companies found  
the devices successfully repaired over 90 percent of AAAs, cut in 
half surgical side effects and sent patients home from the hospital 
in two to three days instead of six to nine. 
</P>
<P>
	But it was not risk-free. Even though fewer women than men get  
AAAs, FDA's advisers said women actually fared worse with the 
experimental procedure. 
</P>
<P>
	The problem is size, Deaton said: Often doctors did not realize  
in advance that many women's arteries were too small for the 
procedure. Efforts are being made to better choose women patients, 
and women whose arteries are big enough do fine, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Also troubling was that some patches leaked. It is unclear how  
risky that is -- how often that leak would build up enough to 
rupture, said FDA cardiologist Dr. John Stuhlmuller. 
</P>
<P>
	Leaks can be retreated, something required for 4.5 percent of  
patients, said Dr. Christopher Zarins of Stanford University, who 
tested Medtronic's device.	   But, ``with surgery, there's a very clear, upfront risk'' of 
complications or death in the operating room, Stuhlmuller said. 
``With the devices, the upfront morbidity and mortality is clearly 
lower. What's uncertain is the long-term risk.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Regardless of that uncertainty, ``patients love it,'' Zarins  
said of the new procedure. ``They're elderly, they don't want to 
have a big operation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The FDA's advisers concluded the key is choosing the right  
patient -- someone whose risks from open surgery outweighs that 
long-term uncertainty. 
</P>
<P>
	Also key is surgeon training.  
</P>
<P>
	``This is clearly the hardest endovascular procedure I've ever  
been exposed to,'' Deaton said, comparing it to building a model 
ship inside a bottle. But ``if you pick the right patient, things 
go quite well.''

<HEADLINE>  U.S. Men Beat Brazil 73-71 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WINNIPEG, Manitoba (AP) -- One did it early, the other late, but  
both U.S. basketball teams came up with victories they needed 
Sunday at the Pan American Games. 
</P>
<P>
	The men capped a long day of basketball with a 73-71 victory  
over a tough Brazilian team. Travis Williams hit a layup with 22 
seconds left after the Americans had blown an 11-point lead. Doug 
Smith followed with a big block that enabled the United States to 
hold on. 
</P>
<P>
	It was a little easier for the women. Playing only hours after  
the worst loss by a U.S. women's team in the Pan Am Games, the 
Americans awoke early and beat the Dominican Republic 92-80 to 
clinch a berth in the medal round. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think any basketball team when you lose by 30 points the  
game before, you want to come out and reprove yourself that you're 
not that bad,'' U.S. guard Michelle Marciniak said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The only thing we wanted to do was push the ball up and down  
the floor and get into the flow of a basketball game and just 
play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The late plays by Williams and Smith gave the men their second  
victory in as many games and put them in great position to reach 
the medal round with one game left in their four-team pool. 
</P>
<P>
	Team USA was trailing 71-70 when Williams got the ball on the  
right baseline. He bounced the ball, pump faked and then split two 
defenders to make the basket. 
</P>
<P>
	``They submerged real quick and I had nowhere to throw the  
ball,'' Williams said. ``I had no choice but to go up with it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Seconds later, the 6-foot-10 Smith slid over from the weak side  
and swatted away Tesch Aylton's driving layup. After Damon Bailey 
sank a free throw to make it 73-71, Brazil's Vanderlei Mazzuchini 
lost the ball driving to the basket just before the buzzer. 
</P>
<P>
	Bailey and Michael Hawkins led the U.S. team with 13 points  
each. 
</P>
<P>
	The women (2-1), who lost to Cuba 95-64 on Saturday night, got  
their running game going for the first time in the tournament, 
resulting in a succession of layups and easy baskets inside. 
</P>
<P>
	Only two U.S. baskets came from outside 10 feet -- a pair of  
3-pointers by Marciniak, who scored 16 points. Lynn Pride, driving 
the baseline at will, led the Americans with 20 points and 11 
rebounds, Danielle McCulley scored 11 and Edwina Brown 10. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm excited to see us score that much,'' U.S. coach Nell  
Fortner said. ``Our transition game was working today and we took 
it at them. And that was one of our goals. Don't settle for 
pull-ups, take it to the hole. We didn't think they could guard 
us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The only problem for the Americans was that for much of the  
game, they couldn't guard Teresa Duran, who led all scorers with 33 
points. 
</P>
<P>
	Duran's 3-pointer drew the Dominican Republic (0-3) to 75-68  
with 9:52 remaining. But she made only two more baskets and the her 
team never got that close again as the taller Americans continued 
to pound away inside. 
</P>
<P>
	Pride, the most athletic of the U.S. players, was only 6-for-18  
in the first two games. She made a number of nice moves, but 
couldn't get the shots to fall. Sunday, she finished those moves, 
making six of her first eight shots and finishing 8-for-16. 
</P>
<P>
	``We tried to work with Lynn on making the easy play,'' Fortner  
said. ``Sometimes she makes the shot harder than it actually is. Go 
up and make the easy shot, just turn and shoot the ball. She really 
concentrated on that today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pride, who'll be a senior at Kansas, said it was all in her  
head. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just had a whole different attitude this game,'' she said.  
``It was a big game and I knew I had to come out mentally prepared. 
It was just go up, because they really couldn't match up with us in 
the post area.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brazil (3-0), Canada (2-1) and Cuba (2-1) also made the  
semifinals. The final two days of preliminary play will determine 
the seedings. 
</P>
<P>
	The Americans play Brazil on Monday and Canada on Wednesday. The  
men finish pool play Wednesday against Canada.

<HEADLINE> Study: Downtown LA Is Shifting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Forces deep in the Earth's crust are moving  
downtown Los Angeles toward the San Gabriel Mountains, possibly 
making the region in between more susceptible to earthquakes, 
according to a study published Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Using satellite surveying techniques, researchers found that  
downtown is edging toward the mountain range by about one-fifth of 
an inch annually. The crunched area or ``shortening belt'' responds 
by thickening, or slowly building up mountains. 
</P>
<P>
	``This probably means there's a greater likelihood of a quake  
inside this shortening belt than other places outside of it -- with 
the caveat that this is over the next several hundred years,'' said 
the study's lead author, geophysicist Donald Argus of NASA's Jet 
Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	The study, published in the August issue of the journal Geology,  
sought to characterize the strains that might be released in large 
and dangerous earthquakes beneath metropolitan Los Angeles, home to 
about 12 million people. 
</P>
<P>
	Such quakes would not be the ``Big One'' predicted on the San  
Andreas fault, which runs far east of the metropolitan area. 
Instead, the quakes would originate on smaller faults responsible 
for building mountains. 
</P>
<P>
	Such quakes would be slightly smaller than the predicted San  
Andreas shaker, but they could be just as deadly and damaging 
because of their proximity to urban areas. 
</P>
<P>
	The magnitude-6.7 Northridge earthquake of 1994, which killed 67  
people, occurred in the squeezed area. So did 1987's magnitude-5.8 
Whittier Narrows shaker and the 1971 San Fernando trembler that 
left 65 people dead. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers found that a 3- to 25-mile-wide belt is being  
squeezed, including parts of the Ventura Basin, San Fernando 
Valley, east San Gabriel Valley and the area between downtown Los 
Angeles and Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
	In the study, about 60 markers were followed over three to five  
years by a network of global positioning satellites. 
</P>
<P>
	The study ``is an interesting refinement of the earthquake  
processes in the L.A. basin,'' said Susan Hough, a U.S. Geological 
Survey seismologist not involved with the report. ``They're 
identifying where the action is so to speak, and exactly where the 
strain is being taken up and released in earthquakes.''

<HEADLINE> O'Neal May Re-Sign With Blazers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- Free agent Jermaine O'Neal is expected to  
re-sign with the Portland Trail Blazers for about $25 million over 
three years, a newspaper reported. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Neal, a 20-year-old backup forward/center who is the NBA's  
youngest free agent, was scheduled to fly from his home in 
Columbia, S.C., and arrive in Portland late Sunday night to 
finalize details of the contract, The Oregonian reported in 
Monday's editions. 
</P>
<P>
	Portland's initial offer -- believed to be about $30 million over  
seven years -- angered O'Neal. On Saturday he called the offer 
``almost a smack in the face.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But barring an unforeseen hitch in last-minute negotiations, the  
re-signing of O'Neal was expected to be announced by the Trail 
Blazers on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``My intention is to come back to the Blazers, and I want to  
come back,'' O'Neal said. ``It was hard thinking about walking away 
from that city.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Portland drafted O'Neal out of Eau Claire High School in  
Columbia with the 17th pick in 1996. He made $1.1 million last 
season in the final year of his rookie contract. 
</P>
<P>
	The newspaper also reported that the Blazers are the favorite to  
sign free agent forward Detlef Schrempf. Schrempf is currently 
being wooed by a number of teams, including San Antonio and Utah.

	JERUSALEM (AP) -- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak said Sunday  
Palestinians have not been flexible in peace negotiations, and 
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat summoned his top negotiators to 
Cairo for urgent consultations. A Palestinian official said a 
meeting Sunday to discuss implementation of the U.S.-brokered Wye 
accord between Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat and his Israeli 
counterpart, Gilead Sher, ended in ``real crisis.''

	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- Rescue workers in dinghies and  
helicopters plucked stranded residents from flooded homes after 
deadly torrential rains. At least 12 were reported dead Monday in 
South Korea. Nearly 7,000 houses were flooded and at least 15,000 
people fled their homes, many taking shelter in schools and 
government buildings where they slept on mats and ate donated rice 
and soup. Towns and villages were swamped by muddy floodwaters 
caused by up to 23 inches of rain.

	Colombian Rebel Army Kills 17

<P>
	BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) -- Police said Sunday that hundreds of  
guerrillas from the nation's largest rebel army launched a 
three-day attack on a police station, killing at least 17 people, 
including nine police officers and four children. Eight other 
police officers were wounded and seven more taken prisoner in the 
weekend attack by the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia. The 
attack, which ended Sunday, was one of the most deadly guerrilla 
assaults on civilians in memory. The rebel barrage was said to have 
destroyed 30 homes, the mayor's office, a bank and a school.

	PALMER, Alaska (AP) -- Two earthquakes shook the Aleutian Islands  
Sunday, but there were no reports of damage or injuries. The first, 
a moderate 5.5 quake, jolted Adak at 4:48 a.m. The quake was 
centered about 30 miles southeast of Adak, about halfway down the 
island chain, and was felt strongly on the island. The second was a 
magnitude 4.9 quake, which shook Atka at 12:11 p.m. It was centered 
about 60 miles southeast of Atka.

	PBS To Halt Donor List Exchanges  
</P>
<P>
	PASADENA, Calif. (AP) -- PBS President Ervin S. Duggan said  
Sunday stations will halt all exchanges of donor lists with 
partisan groups within a week, but when the political fallout for 
public broadcasting might end is difficult to predict. Of the 349 
public television stations nationwide, PBS has admitted that 30 
appear to have engaged in list rentals or exchanges with political 
groups. At issue is whether the list-swapping constitutes a 
violation of federal tax law. Tax experts have said that such 
exchanges would not be a violation as long as all political parties 
receive equal access to the lists.

<HEADLINE>  U.S. Men Beat Brazil 73-71 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WINNIPEG, Manitoba (AP) -- One did it early, the other late, but  
both U.S. basketball teams came up with victories they needed 
Sunday at the Pan American Games. 
</P>
<P>
	The men capped a long day of basketball with a 73-71 victory  
over a tough Brazilian team. Travis Williams hit a layup with 22 
seconds left after the Americans had blown an 11-point lead. Doug 
Smith followed with a big block that enabled the United States to 
hold on. 
</P>
<P>
	It was a little easier for the women. Playing only hours after  
the worst loss by a U.S. women's team in the Pan Am Games, the 
Americans awoke early and beat the Dominican Republic 92-80 to 
clinch a berth in the medal round. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think any basketball team when you lose by 30 points the  
game before, you want to come out and reprove yourself that you're 
not that bad,'' U.S. guard Michelle Marciniak said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The only thing we wanted to do was push the ball up and down  
the floor and get into the flow of a basketball game and just 
play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The late plays by Williams and Smith gave the men their second  
victory in as many games and put them in great position to reach 
the medal round with one game left in their four-team pool. 
</P>
<P>
	Team USA was trailing 71-70 when Williams got the ball on the  
right baseline. He bounced the ball, pump faked and then split two 
defenders to make the basket. 
</P>
<P>
	``They submerged real quick and I had nowhere to throw the  
ball,'' Williams said. ``I had no choice but to go up with it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Seconds later, the 6-foot-10 Smith slid over from the weak side  
and swatted away Tesch Aylton's driving layup. After Damon Bailey 
sank a free throw to make it 73-71, Brazil's Vanderlei Mazzuchini 
lost the ball driving to the basket just before the buzzer. 
</P>
<P>
	Bailey and Michael Hawkins led the U.S. team with 13 points  
each. 
</P>
<P>
	The women (2-1), who lost to Cuba 95-64 on Saturday night, got  
their running game going for the first time in the tournament, 
resulting in a succession of layups and easy baskets inside. 
</P>
<P>
	Only two U.S. baskets came from outside 10 feet -- a pair of  
3-pointers by Marciniak, who scored 16 points. Lynn Pride, driving 
the baseline at will, led the Americans with 20 points and 11 
rebounds, Danielle McCulley scored 11 and Edwina Brown 10. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm excited to see us score that much,'' U.S. coach Nell  
Fortner said. ``Our transition game was working today and we took 
it at them. And that was one of our goals. Don't settle for 
pull-ups, take it to the hole. We didn't think they could guard 
us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The only problem for the Americans was that for much of the  
game, they couldn't guard Teresa Duran, who led all scorers with 33 
points. 
</P>
<P>
	Duran's 3-pointer drew the Dominican Republic (0-3) to 75-68  
with 9:52 remaining. But she made only two more baskets and the her 
team never got that close again as the taller Americans continued 
to pound away inside. 
</P>
<P>
	Pride, the most athletic of the U.S. players, was only 6-for-18  
in the first two games. She made a number of nice moves, but 
couldn't get the shots to fall. Sunday, she finished those moves, 
making six of her first eight shots and finishing 8-for-16. 
</P>
<P>
	``We tried to work with Lynn on making the easy play,'' Fortner  
said. ``Sometimes she makes the shot harder than it actually is. Go 
up and make the easy shot, just turn and shoot the ball. She really 
concentrated on that today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pride, who'll be a senior at Kansas, said it was all in her  
head. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just had a whole different attitude this game,'' she said.  
``It was a big game and I knew I had to come out mentally prepared. 
It was just go up, because they really couldn't match up with us in 
the post area.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brazil (3-0), Canada (2-1) and Cuba (2-1) also made the  
semifinals. The final two days of preliminary play will determine 
the seedings. 
</P>
<P>
	The Americans play Brazil on Monday and Canada on Wednesday. The  
men finish pool play Wednesday against Canada.

<HEADLINE> Study: Downtown LA Is Shifting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Forces in the Earth's crust are moving  
downtown Los Angeles toward the San Gabriel Mountains, possibly 
making the region more susceptible to earthquakes, researchers say. 
</P>
<P>
	Using satellite surveying techniques, researchers found that  
downtown is edging toward the mountain range by about one-fifth of 
an inch annually. The crunched area or ``shortening belt'' responds 
by thickening, or slowly building up mountains. 
</P>
<P>
	``This probably means there's a greater likelihood of a quake  
inside this shortening belt than other places outside of it -- with 
the caveat that this is over the next several hundred years,'' said 
the study's lead author, geophysicist Donald Argus of NASA's Jet 
Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	The study, published in the August issue of the journal Geology,  
sought to characterize the strains that might be released in large 
and dangerous earthquakes beneath Los Angeles, home to about 12 
million people. 
</P>
<P>
	Such quakes would not be the ``Big One'' predicted on the San  
Andreas fault, which runs far east of the metropolitan area. 
Instead, the quakes would originate on smaller faults responsible 
for building mountains. 
</P>
<P>
	Such quakes would be slightly smaller than the predicted San  
Andreas shaker, but they could be just as deadly and damaging 
because of their proximity to urban areas. 
</P>
<P>
	The magnitude-6.7 Northridge earthquake of 1994, which killed 67  
people, occurred in the squeezed area. So did 1987's magnitude-5.8 
Whittier Narrows shaker and the 1971 San Fernando trembler that 
left 65 people dead. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers found that a 3- to 25-mile-wide belt is being  
squeezed, including parts of the Ventura Basin, San Fernando 
Valley, east San Gabriel Valley and the area between downtown Los 
Angeles and Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
	In the study, about 60 markers were followed over three to five  
years by a network of global positioning satellites. 
</P>
<P>
	The study ``is an interesting refinement of the earthquake  
processes in the L.A. basin,'' said Susan Hough, a U.S. Geological 
Survey seismologist not involved with the report. ``They're 
identifying where the action is so to speak, and exactly where the 
strain is being taken up and released in earthquakes.''

<HEADLINE> Aussie Lamb Producers Stage Protest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CANBERRA, Australia (AP) -- Australian lamb producers began  
Sunday what they say will be a one-month picket of the United 
States embassy in Canberra to protest U.S. lamb import 
restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
	About 30 farmers and their families lit barbecues and hoisted  
placards in a park opposite the embassy's main gates as Australian 
Federal Police and Protective Service officers stood guard. 
</P>
<P>
	They were the first contingent of farmers who are expected to  
come from all parts of New South Wales state to protest against 
Washington's decision to hold lamb imports at 1998 levels. 
</P>
<P>
	The move is expected to cost Australian producers about $10  
million. 
</P>
<P>
	John Cobb, New South Wales Farmers' Association president, said  
the protesters wanted to remind U.S. Ambassador Genta Hawkins 
Holmes, and through her, President Clinton, that America had acted 
in defiance of its own free trade rhetoric. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every day we will have farmers here to remind them that if you  
are the leader of the free world and free trade and pull a stunt 
like this, then you are being totally hypocritical,'' Cobb said. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. tariffs, which took effect last month and range from 9  
percent to 40 percent, are intended to protect American lamb 
producers threatened by imports from New Zealand and Australia, 
which between them account for 95 percent of the lamb imported into 
the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	American producers had complained that current tariffs of less  
than 1 percent were too low to protect them from foreign 
competitors flooding the U.S. market.

<HEADLINE> Mourners Bury Atlanta Killer's Wife </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LIZELLA, Ga. (AP) -- Mourners packed a rural church Sunday for  
the funeral of Leigh Ann Barton, the first of 12 victims in her 
husband's killing spree last week, as a pastor urged them not to 
``allow her murder to cloud our memory.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Girl Scouts in uniform passed out tissues before the service.  
</P>
<P>
	Mark O. Barton, 44, killed his wife with a hammer Tuesday night  
in her suburban apartment south of Atlanta. It was the first of a 
string of murders that would become Georgia's worst mass killing 
this century. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, Barton bludgeoned to death his two children from a  
previous marriage. The next day, he marched into two brokerage 
firms in the city's Buckhead commercial district and opened fire 
with two handguns, killing nine people and wounding 13 others. When 
police cornered Barton hours later, he committed suicide. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm afraid there's a temptation to become focused on the  
horrible events of last week,'' the Rev. Doug Davis told about 400 
mourners at the Lizella Baptist Church, 11 miles west of Macon, 
where Mrs. Barton grew up. ``If we give into that temptation, we do 
a great disservice to Leigh Ann.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Davis also read a letter from Mrs. Barton's sister, Dana Reeves,  
that addressed the 27-year-old by her pet nickname, ``Goldilocks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I only wish I could have spared you all of this ... I know you  
are in a safe place now,'' the letter said. 
</P>
<P>
	Also Sunday, services were held in Peachtree City for shooting  
victim Vadewattee Muradlidhara, 44. She will be buried in her 
native Trinidad. A memorial service was also held Sunday for Allen 
Charles Tenenbaum, who was buried Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Nine of the wounded were still hospitalized Sunday, three in  
critical condition. 
</P>
<P>
	Many churches in the Atlanta area addressed the violence in  
Sunday's regular services. 
</P>
<P>
	At the Antioch Baptist Church North in Atlanta, the Rev. Kenneth  
L. Alexander asked parishioners to ``pray for our city. The devil 
is busy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mayor Bill Campbell told the Antioch congregation ``our city is  
in crisis.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's almost unimaginable the horror, the tragedy we've endured  
just in the last two weeks,'' Campbell said, referring to another 
mass killing two weeks ago in which seven were killed. ``When 
people ask us what can we do about Atlanta's image, there's really 
only one answer and that is prayer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At St. Pius X Roman Catholic Church in the Atlanta suburb of  
Conyers, several parishioners knew Joe Dessert, a retired real 
estate broker who was dabbling in day trading. He was one of those 
killed Thursday at the offices of All-Tech Investment Group. 
</P>
<P>
	One said he had tried to get Dessert to quit day trading at  
All-Tech, where Barton also traded. 
</P>
<P>
	``It just wasn't like him to gamble like that,'' said Tony  
Nicholson, who had lunch with 60-year-old Dessert an hour before 
the shooting. ``And he even thought about ... setting up another 
office to trade from, but then figured he had everything he needed 
at All-Tech.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Barton's lawyer said Sunday the gunman approved some changes to  
his will Thursday morning, a few hours before the shootings. He 
gave no indication he had already killed his wife and children, 
said Douglasville attorney Joe Fowler. 
</P>
<P>
	``He looked in all respects normal, just like any other time he  
came into my office,'' Fowler said. 
</P>
<P>
	Fowler would not comment on Barton's changes.  
</P>
<P>
	In its Aug. 9 issue, Newsweek magazine reports that Barton  
recently changed his profile on his America Online account to 
include guns as a hobby and ``Make my day'' -- the line Clint 
Eastwood's character Dirty Harry uttered before gunning criminals -- 
as his personal motto. 
</P>
<P>
	A funeral for Barton's children -- Matthew, 11, and Mychelle, 7 --  
was scheduled for Monday in Lithia Springs. 
</P>
<P>
	The children's mother, Debra Barton, and maternal grandmother  
were hacked to death in Alabama in 1993. Police said Barton, who 
was having an affair with then-Leigh Ann Vandiver, was a suspect 
although he was never charged.

<HEADLINE> Patriots' Faulk Gets Rookie Initiation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SMITHFIELD, R.I. (AP) -- Welcome to the NFL, Kevin Faulk.  
</P>
<P>
	The rookie running back, being eyed to replace the injured  
Robert Edwards in the New England Patriots' backfield this season, 
got his first taste of NFL-style discipline during Sunday morning's 
practice at Bryant College. 
</P>
<P>
	After fumbling two punt returns, Faulk received an earful of  
instruction and got some hands-on attention from head coach Pete 
Carroll. The pair spent the next several minutes running through an 
intensive fumble-recovery drill, with Carroll rolling the ball on 
the ground and standing over Faulk to make sure he recovered it 
properly. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, after Faulk dropped a screen pass from backup quarterback  
John Friesz, Carroll ordered the second-round draft choice from 
Louisiana State to the sidelines, where he caught 50 screen passes 
from rookie quarterback Scott Mutryn. 
</P>
<P>
	Faulk didn't object to the extra attention.  
</P>
<P>
	``If a coach doesn't get on a player, he's not being a coach,''  
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Carroll, too, said the unrelenting pressure was a normal part of  
rookie initiation. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's got to understand how important this job is and the  
responsibility that the running back who takes this spot has on his 
shoulders,'' Carroll said. ``I look for every opportunity to make 
that point to him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Patriots were thrust into the search for another starting  
running back when Edwards, last year's outstanding rookie, suffered 
a career-threatening injury to his left knee in February while 
participating in a Pro Bowl weekend touch football game for rookies 
in Honolulu. 
</P>
<P>
	After the Patriots failed in attempts to make trades for the  
rights to draft highly regarded collegians Ricky Williams and 
Edgerrin James, they opted to take Faulk with the 46th overall 
selection. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite speculation that the 5-foot-8, 197-pounder might be too  
small, Carroll has maintained he thinks Faulk has ``an air about 
him and a confidence'' that will help him get the job done. But 
Carroll added that he has to see more. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's just getting started,'' Carroll said. ``He's got some  
toughness about him. How tough? We'll just have to wait and see.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Patriots also have signed former Indianapolis backup Lamont  
Warren, and intend to give last year's third-down back, Derrick 
Cullors, a chance to compete for the starting job. 
</P>
<P>
	Faulk said he welcomes the competition.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not going to say I can come in right away and play, but  
I'm going to try,'' he said. ``If you start putting too much 
pressure on yourself, you tend to overdo it. You just have to relax 
and let everything take care of itself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Carroll said he will use all of the Patriots' four preseason  
games to let the tailback search play itself out. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not overanxious to make a quick decision,'' he said.  
``There's no point in doing that. We'll take all the information 
and wait. Guys will get their featured opportunities.''

<HEADLINE> Forest Service Remembers 1949 Blaze </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HELENA, Mont. (AP) -- Late on the bone-dry August afternoon, the  
air shimmering with 97-degree heat, 15 smokejumpers parachuted into 
a remote gulch to fight a fire sparked by lightning. 
</P>
<P>
	Within 90 minutes, 10 were dead, overtaken by a searing wall of  
flame 200 feet high. A forest ranger on the ground died with them. 
Two others succumbed to burns the next day. 
</P>
<P>
	This Thursday, the U.S. Forest Service marks the 50th  
anniversary of the 1949 Mann Gulch fire -- the first major 
catastrophe to befall the agency's then-fledgling smokejumper 
program. 
</P>
<P>
	The number of firefighter deaths in a single blaze, 13, was  
unsurpassed until July 6, 1994, when an inferno on Storm King 
mountain outside Glenwood Springs, Colo., killed 14 firefighters, 
three of them smokejumpers.

	The Mann Gulch tragedy inspired a 1952 Hollywood movie, ``Red  
Skies of Montana,'' and was the subject of the haunting, 1992 
nonfiction bestseller ``Young Men and Fire'' by Norman Maclean, who 
also wrote ``A River Runs Through It.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this year, Mann Gulch joined the National Register of  
Historic Sites. Granite markers on the hillside commemorate the men 
who died. 
</P>
<P>
	Like the 10 men and four women killed on Storm King, the Mann  
Gulch firefighters died when a fire blew up and trapped them on a 
steep slope. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Mann Gulch fire was very significant for us. It was really  
the start of the Forest Service's commitment to understanding fire 
behavior, and the commitment to firefighters' safety,'' says Jerry 
Williams, fire coordinator at the regional Forest Service 
headquarters in Missoula. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's where we started developing protective equipment for  
people, better tools ... also kind of a national mobilization 
toward establishing fire line safe practices,'' Williams says. 
</P>
<P>
	On Aug. 5, 1949, the Forest Service crew completed their jump  
into Mann Gulch between 3:50 and 4:10 p.m. and were joined on the 
ground by forest ranger Jim Harrison, who had been alone on the 
scene for hours digging fire lines. 
</P>
<P>
	The single radio that was dropped from the airplane with them  
smashed on impact, cutting off the crew from outside communication. 
</P>
<P>
	The men were heading down the gulch toward the Missouri River  
when flames flared up below them and jumped across the ravine. 
</P>
<P>
	The men quickly realized their predicament. Flames were racing  
up the steep slope toward them. The only escape was over the ridge. 
They dropped their gear and ran. 
</P>
<P>
	The fire overtook them one by one. Eleven died in the gulch,  
where temperatures probably reached 1,800 degrees, according to 
estimates possible today. Two more died in a Helena hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	Only three smokejumpers survived -- foreman R. Wagner ``Wag''  
Dodge, at 33 the oldest member of the group, who lit a back fire 
and lay down in the burned-out area as the main fire skipped over 
or around him, and two teen-agers, Robert Sallee and Walter Rumsey, 
who found refuge in the rim rocks high above the slope. 
</P>
<P>
	Eventually, it took 450 firefighters to control the blaze, which  
grew from 60 acres to 3,000. 
</P>
<P>
	The confusion and lack of communication at Mann Gulch prompted  
significant changes in smokejumper training, says Laird Robinson, a 
former smokejumper and veteran Forest Service official in Missoula, 
who helped Maclean with research for ``Young Men and Fire.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wag Dodge, for instance, while an experienced smokejumper and  
foreman, was a stranger to most of his crew that day, Robinson 
says. Now, smokejumpers undergo a paramilitary regimen in which 
veterans help train the crews they will lead into fires. 
</P>
<P>
	Mann Gulch and other killer wildfires also prompted  
establishment of fire science laboratories, at Missoula and at 
Macon, Ga., where the Forest Service studies how fires behave, how 
weather affects them and how best to fight them in various 
conditions. 
</P>
<P>
	Development labs in Missoula and San Dimas, Calif., invented or  
improved much of the equipment today's firefighters use in the 
wild. 
</P>
<P>
	``In 1949 they wore jeans and a cotton, long-sleeved work shirt.  
They wore baseball hats,'' Robinson says. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, smokejumpers wear hardhats and fire-resistant clothing.  
Several members in a crew carry compact, multi-channel radios that 
keep them in contact with dispatchers, aircraft and other crews. 
</P>
<P>
	And every smokejumper carries a fire shelter, Robinson says,  
``basically a tiny aluminum tent that one individual can crawl 
inside of, that's heat reflective.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The center of attention at this week's commemoration in Helena  
is likely to be Bob Sallee, the last living survivor of the Mann 
Gulch fire. Sallee, 67, an engineer and paper manufacturing 
executive from Spokane, Wash., does not relish the limelight. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm participating in it because I don't really have any  
choice,'' Sallee says. ``I'm the only survivor. I have a lot of 
smokejumper friends who are telling me that, like it or not, I'm 
part of history and I have to go up there and do this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Also attending will be Jack Harrison, who 50 years ago was  
summoned to identify the body of his brother, the ranger who died 
in the fire. 
</P>
<P>
	``My brother had been a smokejumper the year before, and my  
mother didn't want him to jump anymore because it was too 
dangerous,'' Harrison says. So Jim Harrison took a job as 
recreation ranger at a nearby Forest Service picnic area -- and died 
at Mann Gulch. 
</P>
<P>
	``My mother never did really get over it,'' Jack Harrison says.  
</P>
<P>
	``I think the Forest Service has done a good job,'' he adds. ``I  
think if my brother were here today, he'd be proud of what they're 
doing. ... I was thinking, 'Boy, if Jimmy was down here he'd be 
grinning from ear to ear.'''

<HEADLINE> Gun Control Advocates Regroup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Last spring's Colorado school massacre gave gun  
control advocates much to further their agenda. They had a villain: 
the TEC-DC-9, a banned, cheap semiautomatic pistol favored by drug 
dealers. They had a regulatory problem: lax sales rules at gun 
shows. 
</P>
<P>
	But Mark O. Barton's shooting spree last week in Atlanta, which  
took nine lives, is another story. 
</P>
<P>
	Half the nation's police officers carry the 9 mm Glock-19  
semiautomatic pistol assembled a dozen miles from the brokerage 
firms where Barton killed six of his victims. His other weapon, a 
Colt .45 pistol, is the gun Tom Hanks aims at a tank in the final 
scene of ``Saving Private Ryan'' and the gun Sgt. Alvin C. York 
used to single-handedly capture 132 Germans during World War I. 
</P>
<P>
	While the Atlanta killings have energized gun control advocates,  
they provide few clear examples of the narrow issues gun control 
advocates have recently pursued. 
</P>
<P>
	Child safety locks wouldn't have deterred Barton. Police had no  
evidence he got his guns illegally, or bought them at a gun show 
where sales rules are lax. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest slayings strip the debate to the most basic question  
-- should handguns be banned entirely, said Josh Sugarman, executive 
director of the Washington-based Violence Policy Center. 
</P>
<P>
	``Until we start talking about banning handguns in this country,  
this is America's future. We'll have shootings in schools, in 
office buildings, in malls,'' Sugarman said. ``In America, wherever 
you're amid a large concentration of people, you're at risk.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, a group of Colorado students stood at the site of the  
May massacre at Columbine High School to renew their call for 
stronger curbs on handgun ownership. 
</P>
<P>
	Atlanta and Columbine ``taught us all that violence can happen  
everywhere, not just in the inner city, not just by hardened 
criminals,'' said Ben Gelt, a recent Denver high school graduate 
who organized student gun control advocates following the Littleton 
shootings. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokesman for the National Rifle Association, Bill Powers,  
criticized efforts to ``score political points off of a tragedy'' 
and said he doesn't expect the Atlanta shootings to lead to 
significant changes in gun law. 
</P>
<P>
	``If they want to come out and debate a total handgun ban in  
America, that's a debate they'll lose with the American people,'' 
Powers said. 
</P>
<P>
	Glock Inc. and Colt's Manufacturing Company Inc. are among the  
dozens of gun makers named in lawsuits filed by Atlanta, 15 other 
cities and three counties since November. The suits allege the gun 
makers recklessly or unfairly put guns in the hands of criminals. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet unlike the low-cost, high-powered assault weapons used in  
Littleton and elsewhere, the guns used in Atlanta have drawn 
comparatively little criticism. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you believe the manufacture and sale of guns is at all  
legitimate, certainly the Colt .45 and the Glock would meet the 
description of acceptable weapons,'' conceded Naomi Paiss, a 
spokeswoman for Handgun Control Inc., a Washington group that 
lobbies for gun control. 
</P>
<P>
	The Colt .45 was used by the U.S. military from 1911 until the  
1980s, when it was phased out in favor of a Beretta. Police 
officers like the Austrian-designed Glock 9 mm for its reliability, 
ease of maintenance and light weight. 
</P>
<P>
	Both sell for $500 to $550, although custom models can cost  
more. 
</P>
<P>
	The Glock drew unwanted attention in the film ``Die Hard 2''  
when Bruce Willis' character mistakenly said the gun was 
undetectable to metal detectors because it's made entirely of 
plastic. The barrel and other parts actually are metal, notes Bob 
Glass, a gun enthusiast and publisher of the magazine The Partisan 
who has run a Glock through a metal detector. 
</P>
<P>
	``Believe me, it showed up clear as day,'' Glass said.  
</P>
<P>
	Police said a duffel bag in Barton's van also contained a  
.25-caliber Raven semiautomatic pistol and a .22-caliber Harrington 
&AMP; Richardson revolver, both of which he apparently bought legally 
in pawn shops. They weren't used in the killings. 
</P>
<P>
	The Atlanta shootings have drawn attention to two narrow  
gun-control issues: gun sales to people with psychological 
problems, and large-capacity ammunition clips. 
</P>
<P>
	The Glock can hold 16 bullets. The federal Brady bill of 1994  
banned the manufacture of clips holding more than 10 bullets, but 
allowed those already on the market to be owned and resold. 
Congress has shown little interest in broadening the ban. 
</P>
<P>
	Paiss, of Handgun Control, questioned whether psychological  
traits should bar some from owning guns. 
</P>
<P>
	Glock lawyer Paul Jannuzzo said he'd support psychological  
restrictions if there was a way of doing it. But privacy advocates 
would likely oppose opening medical records to gun vendors. 
</P>
<P>
	And there's little evidence a psychologically based ban would  
have affected Barton. Douglas County District Attorney David McDade 
recalled that a psychologist who once examined Barton after a child 
abuse complaint considered him capable of homicide. 
</P>
<P>
	However, in his written report on Barton, the psychologist  
dismissed the possibility of sexual abuse and didn't mention his 
suspicions about Barton's propensity for violence, McDade and child 
welfare officials said.

<HEADLINE> MBNA Mid-Atlantic 200 Notebook </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DOVER, Del. (AP) -- Moments after rookie Scott Harrington got out  
of his car following the MBNA Mid-Atlantic 200 on Sunday, Eddie 
Cheever and Robbie Unser accosted him as he was seated on the pit 
wall. 
</P>
<P>
	Owner-driver Cheever, who crashed early in the race, and Unser,  
who drives for him, were unhappy with the tactics of Harrington. 
Witnesses said Cheever grabbed Harrington -- still recovering from a 
broken leg -- by the collar with both hands and screamed obscenities 
in his face. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think I even played a role in Eddie's accident,'' said  
Harrington, who finished fifth in the race at Dover Downs 
International Speedway. ``I'm sorry if they're upset, but I think 
if they watch the video they'll feel differently.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Unser also joined the dispute, although no punches were thrown  
before others stepped in. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is just the beginning,'' witnesses said he shouted at  
Harrington. 
</P>
<P>
	Later, in an interview, race winner Greg Ray, who crashed with  
Cheever in Dover last year, said the 1998 Indianapolis 500 champion 
``just can't let it go.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cheever has been openly hostile toward Ray, who complimented  
Harrington for his driving. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm disappointed for their behavior,'' Harrington said of  
Cheever and Unser. ``Their lack of professionalism is a bad 
reflection not only on them but also on the series.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Neither Cheever, Unser nor the IRL had any immediate comment on  
the situation. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *CROWD DOWN:* When it became obvious that oppressive heat and  
humidity would keep its grip on the East Coast all weekend, Indy 
Racing League officials figured attendance would be down for their 
event at Dover Downs International Speedway. 
</P>
<P>
	They were right. It fell from about 25,000 in 1998 -- for the  
first Indy-car race in 29 years on the Monster Mile -- to an 
estimated 15,000 Sunday for the MBNA Mid-Atlantic 200. 
</P>
<P>
	``We depend on walkup business at these larger NASCAR tracks,  
and today the hot weather did not help that,'' said IRL vice 
president Fred Nation. ``But we're very happy that the track does 
everything it can to promote these races.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hot and humid are the operative words for midsummer in Dover,  
something Nation realizes will not change. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have another year on the contract with Dover Downs, and we  
hope to be working on a date, and hope things will get better with 
more familiarity in the area for open-wheel racing,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Nation said a change in the date would be considered for Dover,  
but added that decisions on the 2000 IRL schedule won't be made for 
about three months. 
</P>
<P>
	Oppressive heat is a problem in many areas during the summer.  
Last week, in Brooklyn, Mich., only about 50,000 attended the U.S. 
500, filling less than half the seats at Michigan Speedway for one 
of CART's top races. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *THE MONSTER MILE:* Running on high-banked ovals is nothing new  
to drivers in the Indy Racing League. But the 24 degrees of banking 
on what they call The Monster Mile are tighter and narrower than 
those on other tracks. 
</P>
<P>
	``At times, it felt like the steering wheel weighed 300  
pounds,'' Tyce Carlson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Jeff Ward has been among those with the most respect for the  
track, used Sunday for just the second time by the IRL cars in the 
MBNA Mid-Atlantic 200. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was just a matter of survival,'' Ward said.  
</P>
<P>
	He got no argument from Billy Boat, who wound up fourth in the  
race won by Greg Ray. 
</P>
<P>
	``This place is a physical as any track that I've run a  
30-lapper on,'' Boat said. ``But you have to run 200 laps here.''
