   GREENVILLE, S.C. (AP) -- Freshman Danny Marshall hit three field
goals and tailback Louis Ivory ran for 182 yards as Furman defeated
Elon 16-3 on Saturday night in the opening game for both teams.
</P>
<P>
   The Paladins, who shared the Southern Conference championship a
year ago, fell to Elon in the opener here a year ago. The Phoenix
looked like they might pull off another one as they trailed 9-3 and
were driving late in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   But Furman safety Shelvis Smith recovered a fumble by Elon
quarterback Derrick Moore at the Paladin 10-yard line.
</P>
<P>
   Ivory put the game away a play later with a 75-yard TD run.
</P>
<P>
   Elon outgained Furman 325 to 236, but gave up four fumbles and
two interceptions.
</P>
<P>
   Marshall hit field goals of 43, 29 and 34 yards as the Paladins
took a 9-0 lead with 13:45 in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Elon's only score was a 27-yard field goal by Beau Wegmann with
6:40 to go in the third period.
</P>
<P>
   The Phoenix had their chances, but did not score on their final
five possessions. Four of those ended inside Furman territory.

   DESOTO, Mo. (AP) -- A fireworks plant exploded and burned
Saturday, killing the plant's owner.
</P>
<P>
   ''It shook everything and lifted the roof off the building,''
said Wayne Crowell, who saw the explosion at the plant about 40
miles southwest of St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   Firefighters said three explosions started that blaze, which
took two dozen fire departments about 2 1/2 hours to bring under
control. The cause of the explosions was under investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's was the second fatal explosion at an eastern Missouri
fireworks plant in less than a year. In November, a woman died
after an explosion at a fireworks factory in Cedar Hill, about 20
northeast of DeSoto.

<HEADLINE> Rice 30, Houston 27, OT  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL A. LUTZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON (AP) -- Freshman Robbie Beck scored two touchdowns, the
last a 1-yard dive in overtime, to rally Rice to a 30-27 victory
over Houston on Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   The Owls had a 24-17 lead with 1:50 left in the game but the
Cougars rallied behind Jason McKinley, who completed 32 of 47
passes for 339 yards and two touchdowns. The last was a 6-yarder to
Brian Robinson with 39 seconds left in regulation.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Clark kicked a 37-yard field goal on the Cougars'
possession in the overtime. When the Owls got their turn, Beck dove
over the right side from the 1.
</P>
<P>
   Trailing 17-10 in the fourth quarter, the Owls rallied behind
backup quarterback Corey Evans, whose 19-yard run set up a 1-yard
touchdown by Beck that tied it with 2:42 left in the game.
</P>
<P>
   The Cougars then were forced to punt deep in their own
territory. Rice freshman Jeff Vanover burst through from the right
side, batted the ball and chased it into the end zone to make it
24-17 with 1:50 left.
</P>
<P>
   But the Cougars weren't finished. After a 41-yard kickoff return
by Kendall Williams, McKinley completed five straight passes,
ending with a 6-yard touchdown strike to Brian Robinson with 39
seconds left in regulation play.
</P>
<P>
   McKinley also hit Robinson with a 7-yard touchdown pass with
5:24 to go in the third quarter that gave the Cougars a 17-10 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Pre-game temperatures of 102 degrees took a toll on both teams
with the Cougars making their go-ahead drive for the 17-10
advantage with their No. 4 running back, Damon Terrell, instead of
starter Joffrey Reynolds, who was briefly sidelined getting
heat-related treatments.
</P>
<P>
   Several Rice players also had to take breathers from the
sweltering heat.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides also suffered losses. Rice starting quarterback
Jeremy Hurd broke a finger on his right hand in the third quarter
and will be out six weeks. Houston's top receiver, Orlando
Iglesias, sprained his left ankle in the first half and did not
return.
</P>
<P>
   The Cougars took a 10-10 tie at the half on a 1-yard dive by
Reynolds and a 22-yard field goal by Clark with 2:31 left.
</P>
<P>
   Derek Crabtree's 42-yard field goal early in the second quarter
and a 64-yard interception return by Travis Ortega with 6:01 left
in the second quarter gave the Owls their first-half scoring.

<TEXT>
<P>
   RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) -- Ray Robinson rushed for 139 yards and
scored in the second overtime to lift North Carolina State to a
38-31 victory over Arkansas State on Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   Chuck Amato, who took over the Wolfpack program after spending
18 years as an assistant coach at Florida State, won his first game
as a head coach.
</P>
<P>
   N.C. State sealed the win when Wolfpack linebacker Edrick Smith
recovered a fumble by running back Jacquis Walker on third down in
the second OT.
</P>
<P>
   The game also marked a prolific start to the career of N.C.
State quarterback Philip Rivers. The 6-foot-5 freshman completed 29
of 57 passes for 397 yards and three touchdowns and set three
single-game school records: most completions, attempts and yards by
a first-year player.
</P>
<P>
   Rivers' two main targets were Koren Robinson and Eric Leak, who
combined for 16 catches.
</P>
<P>
   N.C. State's Kent Passingham kicked a 33-yard field goal with
one second remaining in regulation to send the game into overtime
tied at 24. Arkansas State opened the overtime with a 6-yard
scoring pass from Cleo Lemon to reserve tight end Anwar Cooper.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson answered, running three times for 25 yards and scoring
from 5 yards out to tie it at 31. He then scored from 1-yard out in
the second overtime.
</P>
<P>
   Arkansas State, which led 17-7 in the third quarter, got 137
yards and one touchdown from running back Jonathan Adams.
</P>
<P>
   N.C. State won its fourth consecutive season opener and improved
to 3-1 in overtime games. The Indians lost their fifth straight
opener.

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) -- Tony Stallings burst up the middle on
Louisville's first play of overtime to give the Cardinals a 40-34
victory over Kentucky on Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   On the first possession of overtime, Anthony Floyd intercepted
Jared Lorenzen's pass.
</P>
<P>
   Stallings dashed 25 yards untouched on the next play for the
winning score, unleashing a wild celebration of Louisville's
players and coaches.
</P>
<P>
   The Wildcats blew a golden opportunity to win the season opener
in the final minute of regulation.
</P>
<P>
   Linebacker Marlon McCree scooped up a fumble by Louisville
quarterback Dave Ragone at the Cardinals' 46 with 47 seconds left
and returned it to the 2. But four plays later, safety Curry Burns
blocked Brandon Sanders' 18-yard field-goal attempt as time
expired.
</P>
<P>
   The blocked kick capped a wild fourth quarter that featured four
touchdowns and three turnovers.
</P>
<P>
   Louisville led 20-19 until McCree picked up Ragone's fumble and
took it 9 yards for a touchdown with 12:50 left. Zek Parker
returned the ensuing kickoff to the Kentucky 30 and Ragone found
Deion Branch for the tying touchdown just 45 seconds later.
</P>
<P>
   Lorenzen threw a 67-yard touchdown pass to Quentin McCord with
8:46 left before Chris Lester's 3-yard touchdown run tied the game
again.
</P>
<P>
   Ragone and Lorenzen combined to throw for 578 yards and six
touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   Lorenzen threw two 34-yard touchdown passes -- one to Dougie
Allen and the other to Derek Smith -- in the first six minutes of
the game to help Kentucky to a 13-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals marched into Kentucky territory on their first
four possessions but only managed one score, on a 33-yard touchdown
pass from Ragone to Branch with 3:56 left in the opening quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The Wildcats led 19-7 after Lorenzen's 1-yard touchdown run with
10:37 left in the first half.
</P>
<P>
   Kentucky failed on a pair of 2-point conversion attempts in the
first half.
</P>
<P>
   Ragone led Louisville on an 80-yard touchdown drive just before
a severe thunderstorm caused a 74-minute suspension of play. The
game resumed at 10:30 p.m. EDT with about half of the stadium's
42,000 seats filled.
</P>
<P>
   Louisville took its first lead of the game at 20-19 on
Stallings' 1-yard touchdown run with 4:27 left in the third
quarter.

</P>
<P>
   In one of the day's biggest upsets, Norway, which reached the

</P>
<P>
Group Two
Netherlands 2, Ireland 2

<TEXT>
<P>
   SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Linebacker Adrian Koch returned a fumble
10 yards for a touchdown and Larry Croom scored on a 13-yard run as
Arizona beat Utah 17-3 on Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   The Arizona defense, hoping to help the Wildcats recover from a
6-6 season in 1999, seized control in the first five minutes of the
second half, capitalizing on several mistakes by the Utes.
</P>
<P>
   On the third play of the third quarter, Utah quarterback T.D.
Croshaw was smothered by three defenders. The ball popped loose and
Koch scooped it up and ran untouched into the end zone to give
Arizona a 7-3 lead in the opener for both teams.
</P>
<P>
   On the ensuing possession, Wildcats defensive end Idris Haroon
reached Croshaw again, forcing a fumble that was recovered by
teammate Keoni Fraser at Utah's 29.
</P>
<P>
   Linebacker Kautai Olevao sacked Arizona's Ortege Jenkins for a
12-yard loss, but a roughing penalty against the Utes on the next
play moved the ball to the 13.
</P>
<P>
   Croom took a handoff and curled around the end for a 14-3
Arizona lead with 9:52 left in the third quarter, finally giving
Dick Tomey an edge over his former assistant, Utah coach Ron
McBride.
</P>
<P>
   Sean Keel added a 44-yard field goal late in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   It was a sloppy night for the Utes, the preseason favorites to
win the Mountain West.
</P>
<P>
   The Utes penetrated Arizona's 35 six times but produced only the
second-quarter field goal. The Utes lost three fumbles and backup
quarterback Darnell Arceneaux threw two late interceptions.
</P>
<P>
   Utah led 3-0 after Golden Whetman made a 46-yard field goal with
five seconds remaining before halftime. But he missed on attempts
of 34 and 32 yards in the first half and shanked a 28-yard try in
the third.
</P>
<P>
   But Utah's hopes evaporated early in the fourth quarter with the
failure of a gimmick play after Arceneaux directed a 78-yard drive
to the Arizona 2.
</P>
<P>
   After three unsuccessful running plays, the Utes spread the
field with a line shift to the left. But Arceneaux's pass to
wide-open D'Shaun Crockett on the right side was broken up by
Arizona's Joe Tafoya.
</P>
<P>
   Jenkins, taking over as Arizona's regular starter after
splitting time for three seasons with graduated quarterback Keith
Smith, was 3-of-15 for 11 yards and was sacked twice.

<HEADLINE> Skydiver Trapped Under Plane  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   DUNBAR, Pa. (AP) -- A skydiver hung helplessly in the air for
half an hour when his boot got caught on the underside of a plane
he had jumped out of. He survived with only minor cuts and bruises.
</P>
<P>
   Andy Judy of Morgantown, W.Va., was trapped 10,500 feet above
the ground Saturday until the Cessna 182 touched down and he was
freed.
</P>
<P>
   ''When we got to him, he looked at us and said, 'My gosh, am I
lucky,''' said Don Bick, co-owner of the Pittsburgh Skydiving
Center in Dunbar, about 40 miles southeast of Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   Judy was one of four skydivers attempting a group jump Saturday
when he got caught under the plane. His parachute was not damaged,
so he tried unsuccessfully to free himself by unzipping and
unfastening his flying suit and boots.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at Connersville Airport in Dunbar sent another plane
into the air to try to help, but that pilot ''determined there was
nothing to do,'' Bick said.
</P>
<P>
   The pilot of the Cessna finally decided to land in a field
beside the airport's paved runway, hoping the ground would be soft.
</P>
<P>
   Bick, state police and onlookers quickly scoured the grass and
runway for rocks and sharp objects that could injure Judy.
</P>
<P>
   ''We had every bit of emergency medical services crews available
in the county standing by,'' Bick said.
</P>
<P>
   Judy was treated at a hospital in Morgantown and released.

<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO (AP) -- Abraham Nunez drove in three runs as the
Pittsburgh Pirates took advantage of Matt Clement's wildness in a
6-3 victory over the San Diego Padres on Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   Nunez, whose infield single gave the Pirates a 3-2, 10-inning
win Friday night, had an RBI infield single in the fourth inning
and added a two-run single to cap a three-run seventh.
</P>
<P>
   Clement (12-13) had trouble with his command as he directly
aided in the first four Pittsburgh runs. The right-hander allowed
three runs, four hits, and a career-high eight walks -- four leading
off innings. He also threw two wild pitches and hit a batter.
</P>
<P>
   Todd Ritchie (7-7) allowed three runs and seven hits over six
innings. Ritchie struck out four and walked one.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Sauerbeck pitched the ninth for his first save of the
season.
</P>
<P>
   The Pirates, with the worst record in the majors, won two
straight games for the first time since beating San Diego on July
28-29.
</P>
<P>
   Pittsburgh broke a 3-3 tie in the seventh. Clement was pulled
after a leadoff walk to Brian Giles. Kevin Walker gave up a one-out
double to Wayne Morris and an intentional walk to load the bases.
</P>
<P>
   Keith Osik then singled in one run off Carlos Almanzar and Nunez
followed with his two-run single.
</P>
<P>
   The Pirates used Adrian's Brown leadoff single in the first and
two walks to score a run on Morris' groundout.
</P>
<P>
   Clement walked Giles leading off the fourth and Vander Wal
singled him to third. Giles scored on Clement's wild pitch. After a
walk and a hit batter loaded the bases, Nunez's infield single
scored another run.
</P>
<P>
   The Padres closed the gap to 3-2 in the fifth on George
Williams' two-run homer, his first of the season. Williams made
only his second start since being called up from the minors on Aug.
13.
</P>
<P>
   San Diego tied the score at 3 in the sixth after loading the
bases with no outs. Phil Nevin's groundout scored one run, but
Ritchie worked out of the jam by retiring John Mabry on a fly ball
and Mike Darr on a lineout.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Clement eight walks upped his total to 108, tops in the
majors. Clement also moved past Cincinnati's Scott Williamson for
the major league lead with 21 wild pitches and is within one of the
majors' lead with his 14th hit batsman. ... Padres manager Bruce
Bochy was ejected for arguing about an inning-ending double play
call in the fourth. With Ryan Klesko on first, Nevin hit a line
drive at Ritchie's right foot. The ball caromed off his foot to
first baseman Alex Hernandez, who stepped on first to retire Nevin
with Klesko moving to second. After Pirates manager Gene Lamont
argued, the umpires ruled that the ball never hit the ground, but
directly struck Ritchie's foot. ... Pittsburgh 3B Enrique Wilson
(sprained ankle), INF Mike Benjamin (back pain) and 1B Kevin Young
(groin strain) probably won't play until Monday at the earliest.
... San Diego's Damian Jackson extended his career-high hitting
streak to 11 games with a first-inning single.

<HEADLINE> Dodgers 1, Phillies 0, 10 Innings  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Tom Goodwin hit an RBI single in the 10th
inning and Kevin Brown allowed four hits in seven innings of
another hard-luck no-decision as the Los Angeles Dodgers edged the
Philadelphia Phillies 1-0 Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Branson, booed by the crowd of 37,244 after popping up an
attempted sacrifice bunt in the eighth, doubled with one out in the
10th against Vicente Padilla (3-4). Dave Hansen advanced Branson
with a grounder to first base and Goodwin drove Padilla's next
pitch to center.
</P>
<P>
   Matt Herges (9-3) earned the victory with a perfect 10th. The
30-year-old rookie right-hander has recorded all of his victories
in relief and all of his losses as a starter.
</P>
<P>
   Brown matched zeros with Bruce Chen through the first seven
innings before being replaced by Antonio Osuna. The Dodgers
right-hander has allowed fewer than two earned runs in 12 of his 28
starts, but is only 5-1 in those games.
</P>
<P>
   Chen tied a career high with eight strikeouts in 8 2-3 innings
and walked only one. The 23-year-old left-hander, who joined
Philadelphia on July 12 in a trade that sent Andy Ashby to Atlanta,
has allowed only one run over 17 1-3 innings in his last two starts
-- after surrendering nine earned runs in 13 innings during his
previous two outings.
</P>
<P>
   Starting against the Dodgers for the first time in his career,
Chen allowed just two singles and retired 13 consecutive batters
before Todd Hundley led off the eighth with a single.
</P>
<P>
   Brown, trying to win three consecutive starts for the first time
since August 1999, allowed four hits and walked none while lowering
his ERA to 2.62 -- second in the NL to Randy Johnson's 2.31.
</P>
<P>
   The Phillies got only one runner as far as third base against
Brown, when Mike Lieberthal led off the second with a double and
advanced on Travis Lee's grounder to first. But Rob Ducey and
Marlon Anderson struck out.
</P>
<P>
   Seven of Brown's nine strikeouts came in a span of 10 batters --
including Ducey twice on called third strikes. The only putout
recorded by a Dodgers outfielder during the first 4 2-3 innings was
a fly ball by Scott Rolen that right fielder Shawn Green caught on
the warning track.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Politte, who was recalled again from Triple-A Scranton on
Friday, is scheduled to make his sixth start of the season when the
Phillies begin a 14-game homestand with a doubleheader against
Montreal on Sept. 12. ... Philadelphia's Bobby Abreu stole his 20th
base in the eighth inning, enabling him to join Hall of Famer Mike
Schmidt as the only players in Phillies history to record at least
20 steals and 20 home runs in a season twice. ... Phillies manager
Terry Francona has been wearing glasses for the past week to
correct a stigmatism. ... Dodgers reliever Mike Fetters, who hurt
his back while making a throw to first base on Tomas Perez's bunt
on Friday night, was held out of Saturday night's game and expected
to sit out Sunday's as well.

<HEADLINE> Stanford 24, Washington St. 10  </HEADLINE>
By NICHOLAS K. GERANIOS
<TEXT>
<P>
   PULLMAN, Wash. (AP) -- Randy Fasani threw two touchdown passes as
defending Pacific-10 champion Stanford beat Washington State 24-10
on Saturday night in the season opener for both teams.
</P>
<P>
   Fasani, a senior making his first start, led Stanford to all 24
of its points in the second quarter. He completed 5 of 7 passes for
159 yards in the quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Washington State was plagued by penalties and dropped passes
that repeatedly gave Stanford good field position. The Cougars have
lost 16 of their past 17 Pac-10 games over three seasons.
</P>
<P>
   After a scoreless first quarter, Stanford's Mike Biselli kicked
a 22-yard field goal early in the second. The drive featured a
38-yard run by Fasani to WSU's 13.
</P>
<P>
   On Stanford's next series, Fasani eluded the rushing Raonall
Smith and completed a short pass to Kerry Carter. Carter cut
through numerous defenders to complete an 84-yard touchdown play,
fifth-longest in Stanford history.
</P>
<P>
   On the next series, Fasani spun away from Isaac Brown to
complete a 37-yard pass to Luke Powell. Two plays later, Fasani
connected with Casey Moore on a 6-yard TD pass for a 17-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Moore ran 6 yards up the middle for a touchdown to give Stanford
a 24-0 halftime lead.
</P>
<P>
   Washington State managed just 53 yards in the first half, offset
by 68 yards in penalties, and never crossed midfield.
</P>
<P>
   Washington State finally scored early in the third quarter when
Curtis Nettles blocked Eric Johnson's punt, and Josh Moen fell on
the ball in the end zone.
</P>
<P>
   Nick Lambert's 35-yard field goal for WSU late in the fourth
quarter produced the final score.
</P>
<P>
   A late Washington State scoring drive ended when Aaron Focht
intercepted Jason Gesser's pass in the end zone.

<HEADLINE> More Leave Japan Volcanic Island  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- A few residents who remained on a Japanese volcanic
island plagued by eruptions and earthquakes left by boat Sunday,
the second day of a government-ordered evacuation.
</P>
<P>
   Almost 600 people left Miyake Island by ferry in the afternoon,
bound for Tokyo, about 120 miles to the north. The last ferry in
the three-day evacuation plan was scheduled to leave Monday, local
official Yoshiko Numata said.
</P>
<P>
   The order to leave came after 2,686-foot Mount Oyama erupted
Wednesday for the eighth time since early July. Only police, fire
and municipal personnel were expected to remain on the island after
everyone else was moved out.
</P>
<P>
   More than 60 percent of Miyake's population of 3,855 fled to the
mainland before Friday's evacuation order.
</P>
<P>
   The island, part of the Izu chain, has been blanketed with ash,
prompting warnings that heavy rain could set off mudslides. It has
also been shaken by thousands of earthquakes.
</P>
<P>
   The government set up shelters in Tokyo, which administers
Miyake, and dispatched ships to the island.
</P>
<P>
   Experts say shifts in huge underground pools of magma are
responsible for the recent volcanic and seismic activity on Miyake.

<HEADLINE> Schroeder Addresses Expellee Group  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN (AP) -- Tackling one of Germany's most sensitive political
topics, Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder went Sunday before a group
representing millions of ethnic Germans expelled from eastern
Europe after World War II and told them he was sticking by his
refusal to push their claims for compensation.
</P>
<P>
   ''The federal government will not encumber its relations with
these countries with political and legal questions that come from
the past,'' Schroeder told the Federation of Expellees at a
ceremony marking the 50th anniversary of the signing of the group's
charter. ''The former eastern territories belong to our cultural
inheritance, but not to our country.''
</P>
<P>
   The group's president, lawmaker Erika Steinbach, did not
publicly express any disappointment over Schroeder's expected
announcement.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, she emphasized that Schroeder was the first ''chancellor
of our Fatherland'' ever to address the group's annual ceremony and
said it was ''good for Germany'' that their chapter of history not
be ignored as embarrassing or shameful.
</P>
<P>
   Reprisals after Nazi Germany's defeat saw about 12 million
ethnic Germans dispossessed and driven from their homes in eastern
Europe. About 2 million were killed or died from starvation and
illness on the trek west or in detention camps.
</P>
<P>
   Schroeder praised the signatories of the charter for their
rejection of violence and revenge and for distancing themselves
from extremists and neo-Nazis who dream of retaking once-German
lands to the east.
</P>
<P>
   He also noted that work had begun at the German history museum
in Bonn on an ''important exhibition'' documenting the subject of
expulsions -- one of the group's minor demands.
</P>
<P>
   However, he skirted calls to push for inclusion of a right to
return for expellees in the charter of rights being drafted for the
European Union, arguing that all citizens will have freedom of
movement once those lands join the EU.
</P>
<P>
   Some expellees have argued that countries such as the Czech
Republic shouldn't be allowed to join the EU until they change laws
that legalized the confiscation of property from ethnic Germans.

<HEADLINE> Richardson Tours Russia Nuke Base  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- U.S. Energy Secretary Bill Richardson on Sunday
toured a nuclear submarine base on Russia's remote Kamchatka
Peninsula, getting a first-hand look at decommissioned vessels
Russia can't afford to dismantle alone.
</P>
<P>
   Russia doesn't have the equipment or the cash to clean up all
the nuclear reactors and waste left over from the Cold War. Of
particular concern to many Western countries are its dozens of
nuclear submarines.
</P>
<P>
   Experts say they pose environmental dangers and are concerned
that the nuclear material inside could be sold illegally.
</P>
<P>
   In Kamchatka, the Russians asked Richardson for U.S. help
disposing of the material inside the decaying, rust-covered
submarines lined up in the harbor.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson's visit to Kamchatka ended a tour across Russia this
week aimed at checking up on a program to make sure nuclear
materials are safely disposed of. On Friday, he unveiled two
storage facilities for spent nuclear fuel from submarines at the
Russian Pacific Fleet's main base.
</P>
<P>
   Although Richardson did not offer immediate help in Kamchatka,
he said the tour of the base showed how Cold War barriers had
fallen and Russia and the United States are working together to
prevent proliferation of nuclear goods.
</P>
<P>
   ''Seeing what we saw, which would have been unthinkable 10 years
ago, represents clear progress in our continuing, evolving
relationship,'' Richardson said. ''Clearly it has not been easy for
the Russians to have opened up their most secret of sites for us to
see.''
</P>
<P>
   The United States has already provided several hundred million
dollars to help Russia build new nuclear waste storage and disposal
facilities.

<HEADLINE> Utility price hikes causes focus on little-known ISO  </HEADLINE>
By JOEL STASHENKO
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Many of the fingers being pointed in the
wake of rising energy bills are aimed at a little-known entity that
serves as a sort of bazaar for the purchase of electricity in New
York state.
</P>
<P>
   No fewer than three government agencies are making inquiries
into the Independent System Operator (ISO) and whether the spot
sale of power under its auspices this summer has unfairly
contributed to higher utility bills for some New Yorkers.
</P>
<P>
   The state Public Service Commission, state Attorney General
Eliot Spitzer and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC)
are all looking into the Independent System Operator. FERC's review
is part of a national look at state and regional utility-pricing
organizations under utility deregulation.
</P>
<P>
   If the outright manipulation of prices has not occurred in the
sale of power through the ISO - as some critics have alleged -
Spitzer said officials must ask whether that entity is doing the
job it was designed to do.
</P>
<P>
   The ISO, based in the Albany suburb of Guilderland, is the
successor of the old New York Power Pool. That was a partnership
under which the state's utilities routed electricity to members at
times of peak demand from those who were generating more than they
needed.
</P>
<P>
   Under the state's deregulated utility landscape, the ISO was
created to serve in that same capacity and also to operate a sort
of daily auction for electricity purchases for utilities who need
to buy power. The hope was prices would be kept down by buying
electricity in a competitive atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   Utilities in New York buy about half their power in long-term
contracts and the other half through purchases in the spot market.
</P>
<P>
   The ISO has attracted attention because of the wild fluctuations
in the prices utilities have been facing - $15 per megawatt hour in
low-demand hours to as much as $1,000 per megawatt hour during
peak-demand hours. In late July, the Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission imposed a cap on ISO-sponsored spot purchases of $1,000
a megawatt hour until Oct. 28.
</P>
<P>
   Some New York electricity ratepayers are seeing the increases
passed through in higher bills. Consolidated Edison's bills this
summer have been 30 percent higher than last summer, for instance,
despite the generally cool weather.
</P>
<P>
   But customers of New York State Gas &AMP; Electric, the Niagara
Mohawk Power Corp. and Rochester Gas &AMP; Electric have not seen
increases because those utilities are locked into no-pass-through
agreements on power charges with the state Public Service
Commission. NYSEG, in fact, has been running ads boasting that it
hasn't raised rates despite the volatility in energy markets.
</P>
<P>
   The ISO, despite being created after ''much thought and
examination by economists and policy wonks ... has not worked,
apparently,'' Spitzer told The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think we need to examine why it has not worked,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Great Britain has used ISO-like mechanisms in deregulating its
utilities industry, but has started to move away from them because
they aren't effective at controlling prices, Spitzer said.
</P>
<P>
   The Public Service Commission is also reviewing the operation of
the ISO. But commission spokesman David Flanagan said the reasons
for energy price increases are probably far less sinister than
critics of utility deregulation have suggested: wholesale oil and
natural gas prices have about doubled in the past year.
</P>
<P>
   ''Those are the primary fuels used to run our generating
plants,'' Flanagan said. ''That is a big part of the equation. The
other big part is we have a very tight market in terms of supply
and demand.''
</P>
<P>
   When two Democratic state legislators declared utility
deregulation in New York a failure last week and called on Gov.
George Pataki to fire his Public Service Commission Chairwoman
Maureen Helmer, Pataki said the lawmakers should instead blame the
Democratic administration of President Clinton for global energy
price increases.
</P>
<P>
   ''The bottom line is it is more expensive to produce electricity
today than it was a year ago for a range of reasons and that is why
the retail buyer is seeing some changes as well,'' said Tom
Garlock, a spokesman for the Independent System Operator.
</P>
<P>
   Spitzer, who is also a Democrat, said utility deregulation has
created ''too complex a structure'' to make any person responsible
for price increases.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't want to blame any particular body or entity yet,'' he
said. But he added, ''There is no question that something is
seriously amiss.''
</P>
<P>
   ''All the indications are that the winter could see another very
serious price spike because of pressure on both the oil and gas
markets,'' he said. ''Whether anything can be done in the time
frame sufficient to address this winter's price squeeze remains to
be seen.''

<HEADLINE> Australia Fairground Ride Collapses  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ADELAIDE, Australia (AP) -- A fairground ride collapsed in a
scene described Sunday as a war zone, injuring 37 people -- four of
them seriously.
</P>
<P>
   One woman was in critical condition Sunday in the Royal Adelaide
Hospital, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Angus Sutherland was waiting in line with his son for a turn on
the Spin Dragon when the amusement ride at the Royal Adelaide Show
collapsed Saturday evening.
</P>
<P>
   ''We were all standing behind a makeshift barrier at the front
and, as the thing fell apart, we had nowhere to run,'' he said.
''It looked like a war zone. It could have been 20 or 30 people
flung to the ground. They were screaming and crying for help.''
</P>
<P>
   Minister for Workplace Services Robert Lawson said investigators
began looking for the cause of the accident Sunday. An interim
report was expected by Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is of concern that these events can happen, but this device
had a current certificate of registration and all its papers are in
order,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Tactics and tone cloud distinctions in key House races  </HEADLINE>
By LAURENCE ARNOLD
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) - Voters may have to do some homework this fall
in order to choose a candidate for Congress.
</P>
<P>
   In three high-profile House races in New Jersey, candidates
share many positions and spend time arguing about who is more
committed to them. The focus is often about tactics or tone. There
have been debates over when and how to debate.
</P>
<P>
   Vying to succeed Republican Rep. Bob Franks in the 7th
Congressional District, Republican Mike Ferguson is running a radio
ad complaining about ''negative'' tactics employed by Democrat
Maryanne Connelly. Connelly questions Ferguson's commitment to some
positions they have in common.
</P>
<P>
   Connelly announced July 26 that she supports repealing a 1993
tax on Social Security benefits. The next day, Ferguson said he
supports the same idea.
</P>
<P>
   Like many Democratic candidates around the nation, Connelly is
calling for stronger gun-control laws. Unlike many Republicans,
Ferguson released a ''gun safety plan'' of his own that would
include mandatory trigger locks, criminal background checks on all
sales and licensing and registration of all handguns.
</P>
<P>
   Sujata Tejwani, Connelly's campaign manager, said Ferguson is
''trying to blur the differences.'' Ferguson said voters should
appreciate his willingness to veer from his party's orthodoxy.
</P>
<P>
   Dig a little and you find differences.
</P>
<P>
   On education, Ferguson proposes merit pay for good teachers and
an end to the tenure system. Connelly supports President Clinton's
proposal to use federal money to hire teachers and make classes
smaller. Ferguson supports, and Connelly opposes, allowing young
workers to divert a portion of Social Security taxes to private
savings accounts.
</P>
<P>
   In the 12th District, another priority race for both national
parties, Republican Dick Zimmer is challenging freshman Democratic
Rep. Rush Holt of Pennington. Zimmer, who formerly held the seat,
is running a low-key campaign that often seems to mirror Holt's
re-election effort.
</P>
<P>
   Both men place environmental protection high on their lists.
Holt boasts the endorsement of the Sierra Club. But Zimmer notes on
his Web site that the Sierra Club has endorsed him ''each time he
has run for re-election'' - meaning his past elections, but not
this one.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the biggest controversy has been a tactical one.
Agreeing with complaints from the Zimmer camp, a cable station
pulled a Democratic Party ad that Zimmer said was inaccurate.
</P>
<P>
   Zimmer says that, had he been in Congress, he would have voted
to repeal the so-called ''marriage penalty'' in the federal tax
code. But Holt did in fact vote to repeal it. The Zimmer campaign
says Holt did so without enough gusto, evidenced by the fact that
he voted also for several Democratic alternatives that were
considerably less ambitious.
</P>
<P>
   Zimmer campaign manager John Holub said Zimmer will draw more
direct distinctions as the campaign progresses. One will be on
permanent normalized trade relations with China.
</P>
<P>
   Holt opposed the China trade measure, citing concerns over human
rights, worker conditions and treatment of the environment in
China. Zimmer says free trade is crucial to the high-tech
businesses in the 12th District, and that he would have supported
the bill.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent campaign swing through New Jersey, President Clinton
spoke at a fund-raiser for Holt and at one for Susan Bass Levin,
the mayor of Cherry Hill, whose challenge to Rep. Jim Saxton of
Mount Holly is another closely watched race.
</P>
<P>
   Levin paints Saxton as too conservative for New Jersey. But
Saxton has muted that argument by winning endorsements from the
Sierra Club; his 1996 Democratic opponent, John Leonardi; and the
former president of the New Jersey AFL-CIO, Charles Marciante.
</P>
<P>
   To draw a distinction, Levin hones in on Saxton's vote June 29
for a GOP plan to add prescription drug coverage to Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   The vote was almost entirely along party lines. Republicans said
their plan would help seniors at reasonable cost by subsidizing
their coverage through private insurance companies.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats like Levin favor a more costly plan that would
guarantee the benefit to all 39 million senior citizens now
enrolled in Medicare. House Democrats called the GOP plan ''a
hoax'' designed to neutralize one of their issues.

<HEADLINE> Explosion in Pakistan Kills 3  </HEADLINE>
By MUNIR AHMED
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAHORE, Pakistan (AP) -- A bomb exploded at a crowded bus stop in
the eastern city of Lahore on Sunday, killing at least three people
and critically injuring 10 others, including children, police and
doctors said.
</P>
<P>
   The blast, triggered by a homemade remote-control bomb,
destroyed a bus and the bus stop's waiting room and shattered the
glass in nearby buildings, police said. It happened in the
afternoon in the outskirts of Lahore, the capital of the Punjab
province.
</P>
<P>
   No group has claimed responsibility for the explosion, which was
the third in the city this year.
</P>
<P>
   ''The explosion caused a stampede,'' said Mohammed Arshad, a
police constable by telephone from a nearby police station. The
police cordoned off the area around the bus stop and removed the
victims, he said.
</P>
<P>
   A 1-year-old boy and a 6-year-old girl were among those
critically injured. Several other people had minor injuries,
doctors at a government hospital said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The blast threw me on the floor,'' said Sajjad Ali, 20, who
was injured on his head and shoulders. ''For a while I thought I
was dead. I couldn't see anything but smoke,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Khasta Khan, another victim, said he was having lunch when the
blast rocked the waiting room. ''I heard a deafening bang and then
my eyes opened in the hospital,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, there have been a series of bomb explosions in
major Pakistani cities, killing scores of people and injuring many
more.
</P>
<P>
   The Pakistani government routinely blames its neighbor India for
acts of sabotage, while India accuses Pakistan of fomenting
terrorism.

<HEADLINE> Computer Allows Home Hospital Visits  </HEADLINE>
By JIM FITZGERALD
<TEXT>
<P>
   WHITE PLAINS, N.Y. (AP) -- When Jessie McCarthy was in the
hospital for major surgery, she was in no condition to call her
friends and family -- in Curacao, the Netherlands and New York -- to
keep them updated on her condition.
</P>
<P>
   She left that to her Guardian Angel.
</P>
<P>
   Using a new computer program at White Plains Hospital Center,
McCarthy's husband, Tim, set up a private Internet page and entered
the e-mail addresses of their loved ones. The program gave a
password to those pre-approved visitors and notified them every
time Tim McCarthy -- the page's designated ''Guardian Angel'' --
posted an update.
</P>
<P>
   Without leaving the hospital or accessing his own e-mail
account, McCarthy could walk down the hall to a visitingOurs.com
kiosk -- there are five at the hospital -- and type in whatever he
wanted people to know.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everything went fine,'' McCarthy wrote on the day of surgery
in July. ''Jessie is in recovery for the next 2 hours and then she
will be moved to the CCU unit.''
</P>
<P>
   Two days later, he wrote, ''After a challenging night, she is
feeling much better now. ... Jessie sends thanks for all your
prayers and good thoughts.''
</P>
<P>
   The friends and relatives could visit the page anytime to get
the latest news, leave their own good wishes and even order a
get-well gift from Amazon.com, Toys 'R' Us or 1-800-Flowers.
</P>
<P>
   ''Hi I'm happy to hear that everything is going good,'' read one
message left by a nephew in the Netherlands. ''Greetings to tante
(Dutch for aunt) Jessie and tell her I send a big ''Knuffel''
(''hug'') and to get well soon.''
</P>
<P>
   Another message made available by the McCarthys was written by a
friend in a language spoken in Curacao and Aruba: ''I am writing in
Papiamento so you can know that Curacao also is thinking about
you,'' the friend said. ''I will check later how the surgery
went.''
</P>
<P>
   As she recovered, Jessie McCarthy, a teacher, wrote her own
messages from the hospital or from her home in Hartsdale. There's
no limit on how long a page can be used.
</P>
<P>
   The program is also in use, or about to come online, at the
Ronald McDonald House in Manhattan, CancerCare, The New York State
Hospice Association and Action for Sick Children in London. About
100 patients were using it during a recent week. A similar service,
called theStatus, is in use at the Cleveland Clinic Heart Center
and has about 250 patient pages, said company spokeswoman Missy
Corbat.
</P>
<P>
   The developer, president and chief executive officer of
visitingOurs is David Gottesfeld, a White Plains psychologist.
</P>
<P>
   ''The beauty of what our site does is once you create that
e-mail list, you don't have to worry about it anymore,'' he said.
''All you have to do is post the updates and we take care of the
rest.''
</P>
<P>
   Though he lets not-for-profit organizations affiliate for free,
Gottesfeld said he expects the business to be making money from
licensing and retail links by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   ''We become financially more valuable the more pages that are
opened up, the more people that are using it,'' he said. ''Part of
this is also just doing good, helping people.''
</P>
<P>
   He said visitingOurs is complementary, rather than competitive,
to other hospital-oriented sites like Baby Press Conference, which
lets new parents tell friends about a newborn and even do a live
Internet video chat.
</P>
<P>
   Vivian Harris, president of Ronald McDonald House, said the
program is ideal for her institution, which puts up 84 children and
one parent each while the kids are being treated for cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ''These kids are away from home, lots of relatives can't visit
and they all love computers,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Angela Cliro, a 23-year-old from Colombia, spent six days in the
hospital in August being treated for Lyme disease and other
ailments she picked up working as a camp counselor in Westchester
County. Since her mother is a nurse and her father a doctor, she
used visitingOurs.com to keep them current on her treatment.
</P>
<P>
   ''I really missed getting my regular e-mail but this was a
help,'' she said. ''It was a great idea.''

<HEADLINE> Studies Support Moderate Exercise  </HEADLINE>
By IRA DREYFUSS
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Harder exercise is better, but even moderate
regular exercise can reduce a man's risk of heart disease -- and the
exercise doesn't have to be done in one burst, new research shows.
</P>
<P>
   The findings, from a long, large ongoing project, show a benefit
that lasts over decades. And they support federal recommendations
that people should do 30 minutes a day of at least moderate
exercise, in at least 10-minute segments, most days of the week.
</P>
<P>
   ''What we didn't know is, by adhering to this pattern of
exercise, that translated into long-term benefits,'' said Howard D.
Sesso of Harvard School of Public Health. He worked on two studies
that were reported in Circulation, a journal of the American Heart
Association.
</P>
<P>
   Both reports delved into the large pool of data in the
long-running Harvard Alumni Health Study. Former Harvard students
answered questionnaires about their health and their health habits,
including physical activity.
</P>
<P>
   One study looked at the intensity of exercise required to reduce
the risk of heart disease, and the amount of time in which the
activity should be done. The researchers reviewed data on 7,307 men
from 1988 through 1993. The men reported their exercise in as
little as 15-minute segments.
</P>
<P>
   As long as the energy expended was the same, it didn't matter
whether the exercise was done in two 15-minute segments or one
30-minute segment, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Harvard study was structured to look at 15-minute
segments, this doesn't imply the 10-minute segments recommended by
the federal government are too short, Sesso said. The federal
recommendations were based on valid but more limited studies, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The other study investigated whether the risk of heart disease
decreased among people who worked out harder. This time,
researchers followed 12,516 men from 1977 through 1993.
</P>
<P>
   The men who did the more vigorous exercise got a better payoff
in reduced risk of disease, the study found. The vigorous
exercisers, who did such things as running or aerobics, had a risk
reduction of up to 20 percent, compared with people who did no
vigorous exercise. But those who walked had a reduction of 10
percent.
</P>
<P>
   The findings support the idea that people who do no exercise
should start, and those who are doing a moderate amount could
benefit more by working harder, said Sesso's colleague, I-Min Lee.
</P>
<P>
   The new studies fill in some holes in the knowledge that experts
had when the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the
Surgeon General's Office released their recommendations in the
mid-1990s, said Gregory Heath, a physical activity researcher at
CDC.
</P>
<P>
   ''We had a body of evidence, perhaps not as strong as this
longitudinal study,'' Heath said. ''This confirms that it wasn't
our best guess, but consistent with thinking and the previous
data.'' Earlier studies were shorter-term, and found improvements
in conditions that could lead to heart disease, such as high blood
pressure, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Heath and Sesso hope the findings encourage more people to take
up physical activity and thereby get out of the highest risk group
for heart disease.
</P>
<P>
   And the findings fit nicely with other work on fitness -- the
ability of exercisers to get an aerobic benefit from their
workouts, said Steve Blair of the Cooper Institute of Aerobics
Research, Dallas. But his research indicates there may be a way
other than intense workouts to get into the healthy, high-fit
group. Long-duration moderate intensity exercise may get the same
result, he said.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Rebels Welcome Truce  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) -- Separatist guerrillas in Indonesia's
Aceh province welcomed the extension of a cease-fire on Sunday and
called for new efforts to find a political solution.
</P>
<P>
   Indonesia and the rebel Free Aceh Movement agreed ''in
principle'' Saturday to continue the three-month truce, known
officially as a humanitarian pause, which was brokered June 2.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are happy the humanitarian pause has been extended so that
the Acehnese people can carry out their daily lives in greater
safety,'' said Abu Tazurra, a senior rebel commander.
</P>
<P>
   The length of the extension has not been specified. However, a
joint statement obtained Sunday said representatives of both sides
would resume peace talks in mid-September in Geneva, Switzerland,
where the initial deal was struck.
</P>
<P>
   The truce has been marred by at least 68 killings. Each side has
blamed the other for the bloodshed while pledging to maintain
support for the peace process.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the deaths, the cease-fire has succeeded in stemming the
worst of the violence in the province, about 1,100 miles northwest
of Jakarta.
</P>
<P>
   Tazurra stressed the new round of talks should concentrate on
establishing a lasting peace.
</P>
<P>
   ''There must be a political solution to the conflict and
international involvement by the United Nations,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Indonesian President Abdurrahman Wahid has promised to bring
peace to Aceh, which has seen more than 25 years of fighting
between government forces and rebels seeking an independent Islamic
state. At least 5,000 people have died.
</P>
<P>
   Wahid has promised more autonomy and Islamic law for the
province, which is on the northernmost tip of Sumatra island and is
rich in oil and natural resources. But he has refused demands for
an independence ballot.

<HEADLINE> German Pols Cited on Immigrants  </HEADLINE>
By BURT HERMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN (AP) -- The trial was swift and the sentence harsh: For
beating an African immigrant to death, a 24-year-old German was
jailed for life last week and his two teen-age accomplices
sentenced to nine years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   The court's intention in the eastern city of Halle was to send a
stern message about neo-Nazi racism. But some argue that the
message should be directed equally forcefully at mainstream
politicians who speak unkindly about foreigners in their country.
</P>
<P>
   Their rhetoric, these critics say, is being taken by the
right-wing fringe as lending legitimacy to the violence that has
led to at least three deaths this year and dozens of other attacks,
including the one on 39-year-old Alberto Adriano, who died three
days after the three neo-Nazis beat and kicked him in a park on his
way home.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a catastrophe; is it any wonder that a small minority
would take these sayings and then begin to kill foreigners?'' said
Jean-Jerome Chico-Kaleu Muyemba, an immigrant from Congo, formerly
Zaire, who works with schoolchildren to combat prejudice.
</P>
<P>
   Human rights groups and others say it's no coincidence that
attacks on foreigners have spiraled alongside increasingly strong
language from mainstream figures on sensitive issues such as
curbing immigration or dealing with the Nazi past.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the statements:
</P>
<P>
   --''We need more people our country can use and fewer who take
advantage of our country.'' -- Bavarian Gov. Edmund Stoiber, head of
the Christian Social Union party, speaking in July.
</P>
<P>
   --''Kinder statt Inder'' (Children instead of Indians). --
campaign slogan intended to push education instead of bringing in
foreign high-tech workers, used by Juergen Ruettgers, deputy
chairman of the Christian Democratic party during his failed bid
last May for governor of Germany's most populous state in May.
</P>
<P>
   --''Germany's capacity for immigration has run over the limit.''
-- Interior Minister Otto Schily, a leading member of Chancellor
Gerhard Schroeder's Social Democratic party, in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Critics claim such statements encourage extremists.
</P>
<P>
   ''They have the idea that they're doing something good for
Germany when they attack foreigners; 'We do what politicians want
to do but can't,''' said Juergen Micksch, head of the Intercultural
Council, a forum of churches, labor unions and human rights groups.
''They feel they are true patriots and these statements foster
precisely this atmosphere.''
</P>
<P>
   When Schily launched an initiative to combat right-wing
extremism in May, Micksch held his own news conference to criticize
Schily for his previous comments on curbing immigration.
</P>
<P>
   Stoiber, the Bavarian governor, is among those calling for a ban
on the extreme-right National Democratic Party. The NPD, for its
part, claims Stoiber has co-opted its own message about curbing
immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   And although Ruettgers eventually distanced himself from the
''Children instead of Indians'' slogan under strong criticism, the
extreme-right Republikaner party adopted it for its own campaign in
North Rhine-Westphalia state.
</P>
<P>
   The slogan touched a theme always sensitive in Germany -- home to
7.3 million foreigners, about 9 percent of the population, but
still struggling with whether it views itself as a country of
immigration.
</P>
<P>
   The Berliner Zeitung wrote in an editorial last month that the
''boat-is-full rhetoric'' of the main political parties has
''contributed to the acceptance of xenophobic thinking patterns.''
</P>
<P>
   Germany is not alone in Europe in coming around to a
conservative view of immigration, regardless of the political
complexion the government of the day. However, it faces a tougher
quandary because of its past.
</P>
<P>
   Partly to make amends for the Nazi era, it has become one of the
most generous in accepting refugees from the Balkan wars and
asylum-seekers from elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   But compromises and cutbacks on immigration and asylum have been
numerous in recent years -- most contentiously during the debate
over relaxing Germany's outdated citizenship laws -- and continue
despite the stated liberal goals of the two-year-old Social
Democratic-led government.

   Even a liberal-sounding program to fortify Germany's flagging
high-tech industry with trained foreign workers contains caveats to
placate those wanting to keep immigration tight. Fewer permits are
being offered than industry wanted, and foreign workers are allowed
to stay for five years -- not long enough to qualify for
citizenship.
</P>
<P>
   Chico-Kaleu Muyemba, who became a German citizen in 1992, has
been to more than 1,000 classrooms as part of a program funded by
the education ministry of Brandenburg state, where he lives. The
aim is to acquaint young Germans with newcomers and prevent them
from becoming like the silent majority that stood aside as Hitler's
thugs propelled him to power.
</P>
<P>
   Speakers visit classrooms to answer any and all of the students'
questions -- sometimes things as trivial as how do dark-skinned
people blush.
</P>
<P>
   The point they seek to get across is that foreigners are an
integral part of German life. Take chocolate, for instance,
Chico-Kaleu Muyemba tells the students. The kids may think it's
something quintessentially German, but it's made from cocoa, which
comes from Africa.
</P>
<P>
   ''When you say 'Foreigners Out,' then you get no cocoa and can't
make chocolate anymore,'' he says.

<HEADLINE> Body found of Marlton man swept away in Delaware River  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   EWING, N.J. (AP) - The body of a Marlton man who was swept away
by swift currents in the Delaware River was recovered Sunday just
200 yards south of where he disappeared, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   State Police Sgt. Robert Singletary of the Wilburtha Barracks
said the body of Gilson V. Desouza, 24, was recovered by dive teams
just south of the Delaware-Raritan Canal about 11:20 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   Desouza, a Brazilian national, is presumed to have drowned.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said he disappeared about 2:20 p.m., a quarter mile
north of the Scudders Falls Bridge where he and five friends had
been swimming and fishing.
</P>
<P>
   Desouza was wading in the river and went to an area that was
deeper - about 12 feet deep - when he was pulled under and away by
the current, which was stronger than normal because of recent
rains.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said Saturday that one of the victim's companions
tried unsuccessfully to save him. That person was not injured.
</P>
<P>
   State police searched the river for about five hours Saturday,
using a helicopter, boats and divers, and resumed the search at 8
a.m. Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said Desouza's companions described him as a weak
swimmer. He also was not wearing a lifejacket.

<HEADLINE> Xerox, once a symbol of corporate success, struggles to compete  </HEADLINE>
By DENISE LAVOIE
<TEXT>
<P>
   STAMFORD, Conn. (AP) - Xerox is going trendy.
</P>
<P>
   The business machine maker has just launched the most expensive
advertising campaign in its history featuring Blue Dog, the popular
pup with bright yellow eyes who has a cultlike following.
</P>
<P>
   The choice of Blue Dog - the subject of popular paintings by New
Orleans artist George Rodrigue - is no accident for a manufacturer
often seen as a stodgy, Old Economy company.
</P>
<P>
   At a cost of more than $200 million, Xerox hopes the ads will
spread the word that it makes high-tech inkjet printers for the
small and home office market for as little as $149.
</P>
<P>
   The company's outdated image - it is best known as a maker of
old-style, high priced copiers - is just one of the problems at
Xerox, once considered a symbol of corporate success.
</P>
<P>
   Its products were so popular in the 1960s and '70s that it
fought to ensure that ''Xerox'' did not become a generic verb for
photocopying.
</P>
<P>
   But profits are down sharply, a botched sales force
reorganization has alienated customers and its stock price has
plummeted to one-third of its value a year ago. The stock has
hovered around $16.50 a share, near its recent low of $14.56 and
far below its high of $50.12&AMP;frac12; a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   In March, the company announced it would slash 5,200 jobs and
close manufacturing plants to reduce its cost structure so it could
stay competitive with companies such as Hewlett-Packard, Canon and
Ricoh.
</P>
<P>
   And both the company and the Securities &AMP; Exchange Commission
are investigating accounting irregularities involving its Mexican
operations.
</P>
<P>
   The last year was not supposed to be a nightmare for Xerox. In
April 1999, the company made Rick Thoman its chief executive.
Thoman was a former IBM executive credited with helping to engineer
that company's turnaround.
</P>
<P>
   Thoman, who had joined Xerox in 1997, had already been
instrumental in the company's push to sell its digital products in
low-end retail outlets such as Staples and Office Max.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Xerox was already struggling to reduce costs as it
shifted from old-style copiers that operate with lenses and lights
to multipurpose digital models that can be upgraded to print, scan
and fax documents when connected to personal computers.
</P>
<P>
   The company was also in the midst of cutting 9,000 jobs, or just
under 10 percent of its worldwide work force.
</P>
<P>
   But the sales force realignment was executed clumsily and slowed
productivity and sales. The idea was to reorganize the sales force
by industry, rather than the traditional geographic organization
used by Xerox for years.
</P>
<P>
   Thoman was fired in May, just 13 months after he took the helm.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Allaire, who Thoman had replaced as CEO, agreed to come
back on a temporary basis. The company elevated Anne Mulcahy to
President and Chief Operating Officer and made it clear she was
being groomed for the CEO job.
</P>
<P>
   A month later, Xerox had to report embarrassing problems in
Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Although the company was initially vague about the problems, it
later disclosed that several senior managers had collaborated to
circumvent Xerox accounting policies. They allegedly created false
product orders to inflate revenues.
</P>
<P>
   That resulted in a $78 million charge against second-quarter
earnings to cover bad debt and unrecorded liabilities.
</P>
<P>
   Xerox fired several top Mexican executives, including the
general manager and finance director.
</P>
<P>
   The Mexican charge, coupled with a revenue decline for certain
products, helped push second-quarter earnings down 68 percent to
$145 million, or 19 cents per share, compared with $448 million, or
62 cents per share in the same period a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   In July, during a conference call with analysts, Xerox
executives were surprisingly candid about the extent of the
company's problems.
</P>
<P>
   Allaire warned analysts to lower their expectations for the
second half of the year. And Mulcahy said things had gotten so bad
that, ''Xerox people have lost confidence in management.''
</P>
<P>
   ''There was a feeling the company has lost its sense of
direction,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Worse, she said, employees had grown increasingly frustrated
with the company's slow reaction to the competition.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our issues kept us focused internally instead of on the market
and the competition,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But Mulcahy said the reorganization of the sales force is now
complete and the turnover rate for salespeople has dropped. She
said the company hoped to keep its strongest producers through
pumped-up salaries and bonuses.
</P>
<P>
   Both Allaire and Mulcahy declined requests for interviews for
this article.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say the company's internal problems are really just
symptoms of a larger problem.
</P>
<P>
   ''The cause of their problems really has to do with the fact
that they're caught between a rock and a hard place,'' said Shebly
Seyrafi, an analyst at A.G. Edwards &AMP; Sons. ''Their core market is
the copier market and that copier market is in decline.''
</P>
<P>
   The market is down in part because many workers prefer to use
printers linked to their computers rather than copying machines.
</P>
<P>
   In the digital copier market, Xerox has been No. 1 for two years
in a row.
</P>
<P>
   In 1999, the company had 37 percent of the market, followed by
Sharp, at 18 percent, and Canon, at 11 percent, according to
figures provided by IDC, formerly known as International Data
Corp., a market research and consulting company based in
Framingham, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   But in the total copier market - analog and digital - Canon led
in 1999, with 31 percent, followed by Xerox, 29 percent, and Sharp,
10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   It is in the small and home office market that Xerox really lags
behind its competitors.
</P>
<P>
   In the inkjet market of multifunction machines - those that can
copy, fax and print all from a computer - Hewlett-Packard is
crushing Xerox and other competitors. H-P had 52 percent of the
market in 1999, compared to only 8 percent for Xerox. Canon came in
second with 25 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Xerox has tried to make inroads in the small and home office
market. In March, the company announced a $2 billion alliance with
Sharp and Fuji Xerox to develop and manufacture inkjet products for
small and home offices.
</P>
<P>
   Xerox has also formed a partnership with Dell Computers under
which that company will sell Xerox laser printers.
</P>
<P>
   The new Blue Dog advertising campaign is aimed at showing
customers that this one-time maker of old-style copiers now also
makes products for small and home offices.
</P>
<P>
   In new television commercials, brightly colored paintings of
various small businesses are featured in an art gallery, with the
Blue Dog prominent in each, while an announcer extolls the virtues
of a $149 Xerox printer. ''They're just a smarter breed of inkjet
printer,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   ''Always faithful to its owner,'' reads a print ad showing Blue
Dog watching over a printer.
</P>
<P>
   But will the new campaign work?
</P>
<P>
   ''The market sees them as this purveyor of antiquated or older
technology and the market has moved on. Copying was big in the
'60s; printing has been big for 10 years,'' said Seyrafi.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts have praised the company's decision last year to
purchase the color printing division of Tektronix Inc., a move that
makes Xerox second only to Hewlett-Packard in the office color
printing market.
</P>
<P>
   But they say it may be a while before Xerox can pull out of its
recent slump.
</P>
<P>
   ''They may be coming out of it, but if they do they are going to
be coming out of their problems in the 2001 time frame, not anytime
this year,'' said Seyrafi.
</P>
<P>
   Keith Kmetz, a director at IDC, said Xerox will be able to turn
things around, but not in the near future.
</P>
<P>
   ''They're too much of a major player and a dominant provider of
products to just crumble and die,'' Kmetz said. ''I would expect to
see Xerox rally.''

<HEADLINE> New state law restricting telemarketers proving popular  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) - Residents are inundating a state agency
with phone calls and e-mails in an effort to stop annoying phone
calls they receive at home.
</P>
<P>
   The calls are in response to a new telemarketing law that allows
the public to contact the state Department of Consumer Protection
and get on a ''no call'' list. Starting in January, any business
doing telephone solicitation in Connecticut cannot legally call a
person who is on the list.
</P>
<P>
   Violators of the law face $5,000 in civil penalties and up to
$25,000 for violating restraining orders, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   In less than a week Consumer Protection has collected more than
10,000 names of people who don't want phone solicitors to call
them, said Bill Ward, chief of enforcement operations for the
agency. About 2,000 people contact the agency daily, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's been overwhelming,'' Ward said, calling it the greatest
citizen response to a consumer initiative in decades. ''It's really
hit a nerve. They're sick of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Ward said he is confident the law can be enforced.
</P>
<P>
   ''We as an agency are committed to investigating complaints,''
Ward said. ''I think we can be effective.''
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut is one of about six states that have passed laws
restricting phone solicitations, said state Sen. Tom Colapietro, a
Terryville Democrat. Other officials say at least 10 states have
passed such laws.
</P>
<P>
   Colapietro said he proposed the law after becoming fed up with
telemarketing calls, including a vacuum cleaner salesman who
offered him $1,000 worth of free groceries.
</P>
<P>
   ''It just kept getting worse and worse,'' Colapietro said. ''I
tried to explain to them that nobody likes me enough to give me
$1,000 worth of free groceries.''
</P>
<P>
   The public can sign up for the no-call list for free by calling
(800) 842-2649, or by visiting the consumer protection website at:
www.state.ct.us/dcp/
</P>
<P>
   Fed up with receiving many phone solicitations, Ward is among
those who signed up.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's ... an intrusion,'' Ward said. ''I don't want to answer
my telephone, that I pay for, to listen to a solicitation.''

<HEADLINE> Sleepy Summer in Hollywood  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID GERMAIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Colonial rebels, geezers in space and a
high-seas mega-storm just couldn't pack the same punch as Jedi
warriors, a wicked witch and a bunch of folks who don't know
they're dead.
</P>
<P>
   Hollywood's summer fell well short of the record $3 billion that
movies raked in a year ago. There were solid successes and one
unexpected blockbuster, ''Scary Movie,'' but nothing on the order
of last year's string of hits and the surprise horror sensations
''The Sixth Sense'' and ''The Blair Witch Project.''
</P>
<P>
   Without such sleeper hits, Hollywood's summer was just that -- a
sleeper.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was a mediocre summer in general,'' said Mark Urman,
co-president of Lions Gate Films. ''It seemed a little tepid. It
took some time for the hits to come, and they were predictable
hits.''
</P>
<P>
   Between Memorial Day weekend and Labor Day, movies will have
grossed an estimated $2.75 billion, according to Exhibitor
Relations Co. Inc., which tracks the box office. The industry
traditionally takes in about 40 percent of its annual revenue
during that period.
</P>
<P>
   That's the second-best summer ever in terms of actual revenue.
The downside is that cinema-ticket prices undoubtedly have risen
over last year, meaning movie attendance could be down 10 to 15
percent this summer, said Paul Dergarabedian, Exhibitor Relations
president.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're down this summer, but you're not going to break records
every year. That is unreasonable to assume,'' said Chuck Viane,
head of distribution for Disney, which released ''Sixth Sense.''
</P>
<P>
   It was simply a weaker movie lineup compared to last year's,
when ''Star Wars: Episode I -- The Phantom Menace'' primed
movie-goers just before Memorial Day. The hit parade in summer 1999
continued with ''Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me,'' ''Big
Daddy'' and Julia Roberts' ''Notting Hill'' and ''Runaway Bride.''
</P>
<P>
   Then ''Blair Witch'' and ''Sixth Sense'' topped things off
during the normally quiet late summer weeks, accounting for 10
percent of the season's total business.
</P>
<P>
   ''Those were just cultural phenomena happening a year ago that
people were talking about,'' Dergarabedian said. ''This year, we're
talking about 'Survivor.' That hurts the movie industry, because
people stayed home to watch that. The public just didn't get pumped
up about movies like last year.''
</P>
<P>
   For the year, a strong pre-summer slate including ''Gladiator,''
''Dinosaur'' and ''Erin Brockovich'' has kept Hollywood a fraction
ahead of the box office in 1999, when movies grossed about $7.5
billion.
</P>
<P>
   This summer, ''Mission: Impossible 2'' was the biggest hit,
topping $200 million. ''The Perfect Storm'' has hit $175 million,
''X-men'' and ''Scary Movie'' climbed to $150 million and ''What
Lies Beneath'' reached $130 million.
</P>
<P>
   Also topping $100 million include ''Nutty Professor II: The
Klumps,'' ''Big Momma's House,'' ''Chicken Run'' and ''The
Patriot.'' Other top-grossing flicks include ''Gone in 60
Seconds,'' ''Space Cowboys,'' ''Me, Myself &AMP; Irene'' and ''Road
Trip.''
</P>
<P>
   The box-office decline comes at a tough time for theater owners
burdened with debt from a building binge of new cinemas. Two
theater chains, Carmike and Edwards, filed for bankruptcy
protection last month, and there are industry rumblings that others
could follow.
</P>
<P>
   With unions for screen writers and actors talking tough about
contracts expiring next spring, the industry also faces the
possibility of a dual strike that could shut down production.
Studios have sped up production to keep the pipeline filled with
new movies next year in case of walkouts.
</P>
<P>
   For the short haul, though, signs are positive for the movie
lineup through the holidays into next summer. The ''Silence of the
Lambs'' sequel ''Hannibal'' arrives early next year, and the summer
2001 lineup includes the war epic ''Pearl Harbor,'' Steven
Spielberg's ''A.I.,'' Tim Burton's ''Planet of the Apes'' and the
video-game adventure ''Tomb Raider.''
</P>
<P>
   Big films this fall include ''Charlie's Angels,'' ''Dr. Seuss'
How the Grinch Stole Christmas,'' ''102 Dalmatians,'' and what
looks to be a strong stream of movies with such stars as Tom Hanks,
Helen Hunt, Kevin Spacey, Will Smith and Bruce Willis, who re-teams
with ''Sixth Sense'' creator M. Night Shyamalan for
''Unbreakable.''
</P>
<P>
   The industry has a ''monumental Thanksgiving and Christmas
coming,'' Viane said.

<HEADLINE> Jews Remember WWII Turkey Shipwreck  </HEADLINE>
By HARMONIE TOROS
<TEXT>
<P>
   ISTANBUL, Turkey (AP) -- Jews sang, cried and read poems in an
at-sea tribute Sunday to relatives who perished decades ago when
their ship -- loaded with Romanian refugees -- was torpedoed by a
Russian submarine.
</P>
<P>
   ''Sleep in peace, my brother, sleep in peace all of you,'' said
Elena Kindler, whose brother was one of the 769 Jewish refugees who
boarded the Struma in 1941 to escape persecution from Romania's
pro-Nazi regime.
</P>
<P>
   Some 60 relatives were brought by boat to the location where
divers believe the Struma lies, more than 240 feet down on the
Black Sea bed.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't have a grave to mourn them,'' said Esthi David
Israel, who lost 13 relatives on the Struma. ''We are here to try
to connect to some spot in the sea.''
</P>
<P>
   After a prayer for the dead read by the deputy chief rabbi of
Istanbul, Nishak Haleva, and the sounding of the shofar, a ram's
horn used in religious services, Tamara Harari Margulies read a
poem she wrote to her sister upon arriving in Israel in 1949.
</P>
<P>
   ''The sea had its way. A scream in the heart of the ocean,'' she
said. ''No one to help or hear the agony of the helpless.''
Relatives from the United States, Israel and Britain threw flowers
in the sea and sang traditional Jewish songs.
</P>
<P>
   The overcrowded Struma set sail from the Romanian port of
Constanza in December 1941. Its motors quickly broke down, and
Turkish authorities tugged the boat to Istanbul's harbor.
</P>
<P>
   Turkey, neutral during the war, refused to let the refugees
disembark unless Britain granted them permission to enter what was
then Palestine. London refused.
</P>
<P>
   At one point a pregnant woman and two families were allowed off
the ship.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Turkish authorities decided to tow the motorless boat
back out to sea.
</P>
<P>
   The Struma drifted for hours until a Russian submarine torpedoed
the boat on Feb. 23, 1942.
</P>
<P>
   The only survivor was 19-year-old David Stoliar, who hung on to
debris of the ship for 24 hours before being rescued by Turkish
sailors.
</P>
<P>
   Stoliar, who now lives in Bend, Ore., did not attend Sunday's
service but sent a letter which was read aloud.
</P>
<P>
   ''For 58 years, no one asked anything about the Struma and it
seemed no one cared,'' he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   He thanked Greg Buxton of Britain, whose grandfather perished on
the ship, for launching the diving expedition to try to find the
boat's wreckage.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the Struma is found or not, many felt the ceremony gave
them finally a chance to be at peace.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a kind of closing of the circle,'' said Sonia Starosta
from Israel, who left Romania with her family on another ship in
1941. They were forced to leave her paternal grandfather behind
because of his diabetes problems. He later boarded the doomed
Struma.
</P>
<P>
   ''This releases things that were pent up inside for 60 years,''
said Amnan Waisman from Nashua, N.H.
</P>
<P>
   Jan Anschell, a historian specialized in Romanian Jewry, says
the Struma symbolizes the indifference of countries to the fate of
Europe's Jews.
</P>
<P>
   ''Only looking at the ship, you could understand that it was a
wreck. It could go nowhere, but hundreds of Jews were willing to
board that ship to save their lives,'' Anschell said. ''It is proof
of complete desperation.''

<HEADLINE> Gore has narrow lead in Gannett poll  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - Al Gore has a narrow lead over George W.
Bush among New Jersey voters surveyed in the latest Gannett New
Jersey poll on the 2000 presidential race.
</P>
<P>
   The New Jersey Senate race is a statistical dead heat, according
to the poll.
</P>
<P>
   In the presidential poll, Gore leads Bush 39 percent to 32
percent, with 25 percent were undecided. Five percent said they
would vote for someone else.
</P>
<P>
   The poll finds Republican Bob Franks five points ahead of
Democrat Jon Corzine, but that matches the poll's margin of error -
plus or minus five percentage points. Thirty-nine percent of those
polled said they were undecided.
</P>
<P>
   The telephone survey of 430 New Jersey voters who were
identified as likely to vote in November was taken Aug. 24-27.
</P>
<P>
   In a Gannett New Jersey poll released the weekend after the
Democratic National Convention, Gore led Bush by 10 points, 44
percent to 34 percent. A similar poll released immediately after
the Republican National Convention had Bush at nine points ahead.
</P>
<P>
   The Gannett New Jersey poll Senate race numbers contrast with a
Quinnipiac University poll of registered voters taken Aug. 18-22.
The Quinnipiac poll found Corzine with an eight-point lead over his
Republican rival with 19 percent of voters undecided. That poll had
a margin of error of plus or minus four percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   Corzine spokesman Tom Shea told the Gannett State Bureau that he
doubted the Franks lead in light of the results of the other poll.
</P>
<P>
   Gannett poll director Gary Deckelnick suggested timing could
account for the difference.
</P>
<P>
   ''A poll is a snapshot in time, and it reflects what people were
thinking at the time it was taken,'' Deckelnick said.
</P>
<P>
   He also noted that both polls reflect a large number of
undecided voters. Methodology could also be a factor. While
Quinnipiac polled registered voters, Gannett's poll focused on
people identified as likely to vote.
</P>
<P>
   Franks campaign manager Charlie Smith said he thinks the latest
poll indicates voters are uneasy about Corzine's sweeping proposals
on education and health care reform.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think there are concerns about Jon Corzine's credibility and
an uneasiness about where and how he would pay for his proposals,''
Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   Both Republican candidates led in northern New Jersey counties,
according to the Gannett poll, and Franks led 34 percent to 21
percent in central New Jersey. Democrats were stronger in southern
New Jersey. Gore led Bush 45 percent to 27 percent, while Corzine
led Franks 28 percent to 21 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The poll is sponsored by the seven Gannett daily newspapers in
New Jersey.

<HEADLINE> E.U. Keeps Sanctions on Serbia  </HEADLINE>
By JEFFREY ULBRICH
<TEXT>
<P>
   EVIAN, France (AP) -- The European Union, though increasingly
skeptical about the effectiveness of economic and other sanctions
against Serbia, made no move to lift them Sunday for fear of
helping Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic in this month's
elections.
</P>
<P>
   France, current president of the EU, is among the countries that
have been pushing for an end to the sanctions, imposed more than a
year ago during the war in Kosovo. The French and a number of other
EU nations believe the sanctions have failed to isolate Milosevic
and are alienating and hurting ordinary Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   The 15 EU foreign ministers, ending their weekend meeting at
this Lake Geneva resort, agreed that lifting the sanctions now
could help Milosevic win the election. The message the ministers
want to send, according to French Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine,
is that a return to democracy in Yugoslavia would mean an end to
the European sanctions and a massive influx of aid.
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslavia holds its presidential, parliamentary and local
elections Sept. 24 in a vote increasingly seen as a referendum on
Milosevic's rule. The Yugoslav strongman is facing his first
serious challenge after a decade in power from opposition candidate
Vojislav Kostunica, who leads all independent opinion polls.
</P>
<P>
   The ministers here agreed ''that this was not the right time to
lift sanctions,'' British Foreign Minister Robin Cook said. ''That
would send a confusing message.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the EU nations see the sanctions as not particularly
effective against the government but serve only to anger and hurt
ordinary Serbs. But Britain, the Netherlands and Denmark, among
countries hesitant to ease the sanctions, see them as one of the
few weapons the EU can wield against Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   The foreign ministers, at their last meeting in July, already
began to ease the sanctions, agreeing to a temporary suspension on
a ban on commercial flights between Yugoslavia and the 15 EU
nations. They also added 50 firms to the list of 190 Serbian
companies exempted from EU financial sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, the ministers, keen not to upset the fragile Middle
East peace process, skirted the question of a declaration of
statehood by the Palestinian leadership, settling for a pledge to
push both Israel and the Palestinians toward a peace deal.
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinians have said they would declare a state on Sept.
13, the target date they and the Israelis set for completing a
peace treaty. Most officials here believe Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat will postpone the declaration to give the negotiations a
little more time -- but they won't say so on the record.
</P>
<P>
   German Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer said the EU's March 1999
statement acknowledging the inevitability of statehood for the
Palestinians speaks for itself. What is left to be sorted out, he
said, ''are the conditions to achieve that.''

<HEADLINE> Families on Film at Venice Festival  </HEADLINE>
By CANDICE HUGHES
<TEXT>
<P>
   VENICE, Italy (AP) -- It's family film time on the Lido -- but not
in the usual sense. Think murderous moms. Doting, dotty dads.
Lesbian cheerleader daughters. From nasty to nice, from nuclear to
not, families are a hot topic at the Venice Film Festival's 57th
edition.
</P>
<P>
   One of the standout films so far, ''You Can Count On Me,'' by
first-time director Kenneth Lonergan, is the touching tale of a
brother and sister who were orphaned young and had only each other
to count on.
</P>
<P>
   Sammy, the straight-arrow sister, is played by Laura Linney, who
appeared in ''The Truman Show,'' ''Absolute Power,'' and ''Primal
Fear.''
</P>
<P>
   Divorced, she has an 8-year-old son and an uneventful life --
that is until her brother Terry, a likable screw-up played by Mark
Ruffalo, shows up after an absence of several years.
</P>
<P>
   ''You Can Count On Me,'' a co-winner of the Sundance Film
Festival's grand jury prize that boasts veteran director Martin
Scorsese as its executive producer, was screened out of competition
to excellent reviews.
</P>
<P>
   At the other end of the emotional scale is the family depicted
in the venerable French director Claude Chabrol's ''Nightcap''
(''Merci Pour Le Chocolat''). On the surface, everything seems
fine, but deep down inside Mom (played by Isabelle Huppert) is a
moral monster.
</P>
<P>
   Elegantly made, the film has a wonderful performance by the
always reliable Huppert, but the plot suffers from some gaping
holes, including one involving a drugged nightcap of hot chocolate.
</P>
<P>
   Chabrol, 70, is a member of the jury this year and his movie was
screened out of competition.
</P>
<P>
   Huppert, a stalwart of French cinema, also appears in one of the
films competing for the Golden Lion: ''Comedy of Innocence''
(''Fils de Deux Meres ou Comedie de l'Innocence''), which director
Raul Ruiz calls a ghost movie ''without ghosts.''
</P>
<P>
   It is a strange and slow-moving tale of a boy who decides a
stranger, a woman whose own son has died, is actually his mother.
His real mother, played by Huppert, is drawn into a relationship
with the woman, seemingly hypnotized.
</P>
<P>
   Two other films among the 20 competing for a Golden Lion deal
with family life, Robert Altman's satirical comedy ''Dr. T and the
Women'' and ''Liam,'' by Britain's Stephen Frears, whose films
include ''Dangerous Liaisons'' (1988) and ''The Grifters'' (1990).
</P>
<P>
   ''Liam,'' the story of an Irish Catholic family in Liverpool in
the 1930s, premieres Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the wackiest film family at the festival is the
low-budget, Flemish-language comedy ''Everybody Famous!''
(''Iedereen Beroemd!'') by Belgium's Dominique Deruddere.
</P>
<P>
   It's a blackly funny story about how some people will do
anything to become famous. It centers on an out-of-work factory
hand, his plump daughter's show business aspirations and the
improbable way he gets her ''big break.''
</P>
<P>
   The film was screened out of competition.

<HEADLINE> State readies for school construction review  </HEADLINE>
By KATHLEEN CANNON
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - The first emergency projects funded by New
Jersey's historic $8.6 billion school construction legislation are
expected to get under way this fall, state officials say.
</P>
<P>
   The initial work will include fixing leaky roofs, repairing
faulty wiring and other safety-related repairs.
</P>
<P>
   Some work on classroom expansion projects and construction of
new labs and libraries is expected to begin later this year, but
schools across the state will have to wait until at least next
summer for their biggest projects.
</P>
<P>
   State officials still are gearing up a massive bureaucracy to
review, approve and manage projects designed to comply with the
court-ordered construction binge.
</P>
<P>
   A critic said he fears the state is not preparing adequately or
quickly enough, leaving the state's 30 so-called ''special needs''
districts in the dark and without the necessary dollars to do the
job right.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Christie Whitman signed the legislation to begin the
state's largest public works project on July 18, complying with a
state Supreme Court ruling ordering replacement or repair of
crumbling buildings in the poorest districts.
</P>
<P>
   About $6 billion of the funds are reserved for the special needs
schools, the remainder for richer suburban districts around the
state.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our expectation is every district with a building will be
looking to take advantage of this program,'' said Dave Mortimer,
assistant commissioner in the Department of Education.
</P>
<P>
   The exact amount of the first year's allotment of funding is not
known. State officials must first approve, then calculate, the
total value of two types of projects: fast-track jobs that address
emergency needs in poor schools and non-emergency projects in all
schools that are ready to go and are approved by the state.
</P>
<P>
   According to Mortimer, emergency repairs at all the 450 school
buildings in the poor districts are being assessed. He said about
125 of the reviews are nearly complete.
</P>
<P>
   Once approved by the education officials, these projects will be
forwarded to the Economic Development Authority, which will
estimate their costs, he explained.
</P>
<P>
   The same procedure will be followed for any district that is
granted a waiver from a lengthier review process because it has
documented a need for a project that is ready to go. Twenty-five
districts have sought waivers. Nine have been approved already by
the Department of Education but have not yet received EDA
estimates, he said.
</P>
<P>
   According to Mortimer, ground could be broken for more than $600
million worth of construction by next summer.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, Department of Education staff will review the
lengthier five-year plans of districts whose projects are planned
for future years, he said.
</P>
<P>
   They include long-range plans for each of the special needs
districts. To date, nine are in the final stages of study, Mortimer
said. He expects to begin approving the special needs plans this
month.
</P>
<P>
   But David Sciarra, director of the Education Law Center which
sued the state on behalf of the poor school children, is not
confident the state will cooperate fully with the court order.
</P>
<P>
   Too few of the poor schools have received satisfactory early
answers from the state about their facilities plans, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's still an opportunity for the process to go forward
that respects the court order. We still have time to correct
this,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''But I would say that the Department of Education has yet to
demonstrate that it's up to this task,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   If Sciarra's fears are realized, the Education Law Center will
again take the state to court, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The final outcome of this, if the Department of Education does
not confront its shortcomings, is more disputes that wind up in
court and more delays for children to receive what they need and
what they are entitled to,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Diana's Mother Doubts Conspiracy  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- The mother of Princess Diana isn't buying any
conspiracy theories about her daughter's death.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview published three days after the third anniversary
of Diana's death, the Sunday Express quoted Frances Shand Kydd as
saying there is no proof to support such claims, and that they only
cause pain to the princess' loved ones.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Mohamed Al Fayed, owner of Harrod's department store,
filed a lawsuit seeking to obtain any documents by the CIA and
other U.S. government agencies pertaining to the Paris car crash
that killed Diana, his son Dodi Al Fayed, and the car's driver.
</P>
<P>
   Al Fayed contends the deaths were a murder conspiracy plotted by
people who disapproved of Diana's relationship with his son.
Authorities say the driver of the car was intoxicated.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have trawled the depths of my imagination alongside
extensive factual knowledge and found no shred of evidence to
support the (conspiracy) stories,'' Shand Kydd said.

<HEADLINE> Borscht Belt comics and hotels mainly gone, but beet soup still reigns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ELLENVILLE, N.Y. (AP) - The Catskills now has a contest to
celebrate the food that accompanied the comics and hotels that
attracted Jewish crowds here for decades.
</P>
<P>
   The inaugural Borscht Belt Cookoff was held Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The award for the best beet soup went to Micky Lanza, who cooks
in a cafe she and her mother own in nearby Wurtsboro. Lanza, whose
kitchen career began just four years ago, after the Borscht Belt
had all but withered completely, borrowed from several cookbooks
for her prize-winning potage.
</P>
<P>
   The first-place soup was a thick variety made with beets,
onions, celery, fresh garlic and basil. Lanza added horseradish to
the traditional sour cream topping.
</P>
<P>
   ''She must have made three or four pots,'' said Lanza's mother,
Patricia. ''I ate till borscht was running out of my ears, till she
got one that was just it.''
</P>
<P>
   That's why mother, not daughter took home the first prize - a
borscht belt, adorned with a soup tureen and the gently rolling
Catskills.
</P>
<P>
   Borscht is still a mainstay of local hotels.
</P>
<P>
   ''People love it,'' said Harriet Brahms, vice president at
Kutsher's Country Club in Monticello, one of the last of the great
Catskills resorts. ''When people get here, they want to eat it.
They don't get it at home. It's a classic, and we make it very
well.''

   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Following a highly publicized breakup, Ellen
DeGeneres and Anne Heche have decided to sell their $2.75 million
home.
</P>
<P>
   The pair purchased the 4,000-square-foot, farmhouse-style
structure in 1998. It sits on 10 acres of property that includes
working avocado and citrus orchards in Ojai, a coastal community
north of Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   The two still own a Hollywood Hills home, which they bought for
$1.7 million in June 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Heche, 31, and DeGeneres, 42, announced their breakup Aug. 19.
Heche was hospitalized just hours later after parking her car along
a highway, wandering up to a home and making strange statements to
the occupants.
</P>
<P>
   Heche was treated at a hospital, but additional details were
never made available.
</P>
<P>
   DeGeneres was the first openly gay lead on television with her

<HEADLINE> Funding is biggest challenge for Connecticut's charter schools  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press	   As Connecticut's experiment with charter schools
enters its
fourth school year, it's not student achievement that's the biggest
challenge to the founders of the schools.
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's money.
</P>
<P>
   ''No one's ready to throw in the towel yet,'' said John
Champion, who helped start Common Ground Charter High School in New
Haven three years ago. ''But it's becoming more difficult to make
significant gains year to year.''
</P>
<P>
   Champion, an experienced fund-raiser, didn't realize getting
grants for the school would be so difficult.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think the foundations feel the state's trying to get away on
the cheap,'' Champion said. ''That the services we use the grant
for should be provided by the taxpayer.''
</P>
<P>
   Charter schools were created to spark creativity and free
educators of bureaucratic red tape by releasing them from local
school board control. They also are designed to create public
school choice.
</P>
<P>
   The state now has 16 charter schools, serving 2,139 students as
of last year. This year, the state will pay charter schools $7,000
per student.
</P>
<P>
   A report released this summer by the Evaluation Center of
Western Michigan University suggests there is no shortage of
paperwork at charters and that they actually cost 11 to 33 percent
more to run than regular schools. They get about $1,000 less per
pupil than other public schools in public aid.
</P>
<P>
   A study by the Center for Education Reform in Washington, D.C.
found underfunding to be the norm among most of the nearly 2,000
charter schools across the country.
</P>
<P>
   ''Since the first charter law was passed in 1991, charter
operators have struggled against tremendous financial odds to
create a place where children can succeed and thrive
academically,'' said Jeanne Allen, president of CER.
</P>
<P>
   Many states recognize the funding inequity and are looking at
amending their charter laws, Allen said. Whether Connecticut will
depends on the new biennium budget to be hammered out this
legislative session by Gov. John G. Rowland and the General
Assembly.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Thomas Gaffey, a Meriden Democrat who is co-chairman of the
legislature's Education Committee, said that while charter schools
seem to be doing a good job, he is concerned with balancing their
needs against others, including the state's $1 billion commitment
to school construction costs.
</P>
<P>
   Rowland spokesman Chris Cooper said Friday the governor still
supports charter schools but could not say what would be proposed
for them in the new budget.
</P>
<P>
   The state Department of Education is looking into helping
charters secure facilities more easily, said Thomas Murphy, a
department spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   ''But at the same time these are the same people who said, 'We
can do it better for less,' '' Murphy said. ''Maybe it can't be
done better for less.''
</P>
<P>
   Tim Dutton of Bridge Academy Charter School in Bridgeport said
the state was clear about how much they were giving charter schools
from the outset.
</P>
<P>
   ''But I had hoped that there would be more of a cost of living
built in automatically,'' Dutton said. ''They're asking us to do so
much - to revolutionize education. It doesn't make sense to fund us
at a lower amount.''

<HEADLINE> Lebanon Holds Parliamentary Election  </HEADLINE>
By SAM F. GHATTAS
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) -- Billionaire businessman Rafik Hariri and
the candidates he supports were expected to make a strong showing
in Sunday's final round of parliamentary elections, a success that
could set up a clash with the Lebanese president.
</P>
<P>
   Hariri, a former prime minister who tried to rebuild Lebanon
following its devastating civil war, hopes to once again lead the
country, where political fortunes depend heavily on the desires of
neighboring Syria.
</P>
<P>
   Candidates backed by Hariri made a strong showing in the first
stage of voting a week before and were expected to do well again
Sunday, in which residents of the former Israeli-occupied zone in
the south voted for the first time in nearly 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   If Hariri wins and goes on to seek the premiership, it could
create a confrontation with President Emile Lahoud, who names the
prime minister after polling parliament members. The second-round
election results were expected Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Lahoud backs current Prime Minister Salim Hoss and vehemently
opposes Hariri. Hariri and Hoss ran for separate Beirut seats; both
were expected to win their seats.
</P>
<P>
   Hariri was accused during the campaign of using his vast fortune
to woo voters -- he says he merely has provided money for
scholarships as well as financial and medical aid to needy
Lebanese. He also was accused of shackling Lebanon with $20 billion
in debt during his 1992-98 government, when he launched a
multibillion dollar plan to rebuild Lebanon from the 1975-90 civil
war.
</P>
<P>
   Christians and Muslims, leftists and rightists teamed up with
Hariri in the campaign to protest the military's role in politics
and Lahoud's failure to right the economy. While the concerted
attack on Lahoud was unusual, at least one sacred cow remained: Few
candidates from either side criticized Syria's involvement. Syria
has 30,000 troops in Lebanon and dominates it militarily and
politically.
</P>
<P>
   Hariri and Lahoud were both considered close to Syria and both
will be looking for its support.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everybody knows how a prime minister is made in Lebanon -- this
will be decided by the head of state in coordination with
Damascus,'' Interior Minister Michel Murr, a Lahoud ally, said last
week.
</P>
<P>
   In Damascus, Syrian President Bashar Assad has met Lebanese
candidates from all factions, including Hariri and Hoss, in what is
viewed as preparation for determining who will be the next prime
minister and an attempt to keep the Hariri-Lahoud rivalry from
creating dangerous divisions.
</P>
<P>
   Some 259 candidates contested 65 seats in the legislature Sunday
following voting for the 63 other seats a week earlier in North and
Mount Lebanon provinces.
</P>
<P>
   The second round of voting, which took place in Beirut, the
eastern Bekaa Valley and the southern provinces, was largely
peaceful. Two men were stabbed by supporters of opposing candidates
in Beirut; security forces also picked up a campaign official for
allegedly bribing voters.
</P>
<P>
   About 1 million out of 1.4 million eligible voters were
registered to cast ballots Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   In south Lebanon, Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri's pro-Syrian
Amal group teamed up with Shiite Muslim rivals of the
Iranian-backed Hezbollah against traditional Shiite Muslim
politicians and a former Hezbollah chief who is fielding
candidates. Hezbollah Secretary-General Sheik Hassan Nasrallah
issued a religious ruling Sunday ordering followers to vote for the
Amal-Hezbollah ticket.
</P>
<P>
   Hezbollah and Amal led a guerrilla war against Israeli forces in
southern Lebanon and hoped to bank on increased popularity after
Israeli troops withdrew from the border zone in May, ending an
18-year occupation.
</P>
<P>
   The last time that residents of the former Israeli-occupied zone
in the south voted was in the 1972 parliamentary elections. There
were no elections in Lebanon during the civil war and parliamentary
polls in 1992 and 1996 did not include the border areas because of
the Israeli occupation.
</P>
<P>
   ''I feel very proud about the election,'' said Munah Samara in
Marjayoun after voting for the first time since 1972. The town is
the former stronghold of Israeli-backed militiamen, about five
miles north of the Israeli border.
</P>
<P>
   ''After the liberation, the elections mean the return of
legitimate authority and a move for the better in a region that has
been neglected for long,'' added the 50-year-old businessman who
voted for opponents of the Amal-Hezbollah ticket.
</P>
<P>
   Voting in Muslim areas of the southern border zone was heavier
than in Christian areas, like Marjayoun, where Eastern Orthodox
Bishop Elias Kfoury said Christian turnout was low ''because some
people are either in prison or outside the country.''
</P>
<P>
   Two-thirds of the 6,000 Lebanese who fled to Israel in the final
hours of the occupation were Christians allied with the Jewish
state. Other residents are in jail for collaborating with Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Only 500 out of 8,000 eligible voters in Marjayoun were expected
to vote, said Moussa Jibran, the town's Moukhtar, or elder.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, voting in Shiite areas was brisk and residents
appeared to back the guerrillas. ''They gave their blood for the
liberation of the country and they have my vote,'' said Mahmoud
Beydoun, a 55-year-old butcher in Bint Jbeil.

<HEADLINE> Iran: US Attempts to Lift Sanctions  </HEADLINE>
By ALI AKBAR DAREINI
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) -- Iran's parliament speaker said Sunday that
attempts are being made in the United States to lift trade
sanctions against Iran, the official Islamic Republic News Agency
reported after American and Iranian lawmakers met for the first
time since the 1979 Islamic revolution.
</P>
<P>
   ''It seems that there are efforts under way in the United States
for lifting sanctions against Iran,'' IRNA quoted Mahdi Karrubi as
saying Sunday after returning from New York where he and four other
Iranian lawmakers attended a meeting of world parliament leaders at
the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   Karrubi did not provide details, but IRNA said Karrubi also met
representatives of some American companies who want the U.S.
sanctions lifted. The speaker told state-run Tehran television
Sunday that he met leaders of American oil companies and discussed
the sanctions issue with them.
</P>
<P>
   American companies are barred under the 1996 sanctions law from
investing more than $20 million in Iran's oil and gas sector. As a
result, U.S. firms have lost billions of dollars in contracts to
European competitors.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Arlen Specter, a Republican from Pennsylvania, Rep. Robert
Ney, an Ohio Republican who favors increased dialogue with Tehran,
and two other lawmakers, Eliot Engel and Gary Ackerman, both
Democrats from New York, met Karrubi and four other Iranian
lawmakers at a Metropolitan Museum of Art reception sponsored by
the American Iranian Council, which seeks improved relations
between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
   The pro-reform Hayat-e-Now daily newspaper quoted Karrubi as
criticizing ''hostile policies'' pursued by the U.S. government and
Congress against Iran and as saying the meeting had ''not been
planned.'' He acknowledged, however, that at the museum the
lawmakers discussed ''closer relations'' between Tehran and
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Specter said Thursday that the meeting was ''one step removed''
from official government-to-government contacts, which were severed
after the seizure of the U.S. Embassy in Tehran in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, a State Department spokesman said Sunday there
has been no change in the sanctions policy toward Iran.
</P>
<P>
   Tehran University professor and political analyst Davoud
Hermidas Bavand described the meeting as a step in accordance with
the national interests of both countries.
</P>
<P>
   Hayat-e-Now quoted Karrubi as saying 10 U.S. senators signed a
letter to Iran's reformist-dominated parliament seeking meetings in
Iran, the United States or a third country. The letter was written
after the reformist-dominated parliament, or Majlis, was formed in
May.
</P>
<P>
   Washington lifted trade sanctions in March relating to certain
Iranian luxury goods, including caviar, carpets and pistachios,
after reformists won February legislative elections.

<HEADLINE> Group: Iraq Sanctions Miss Target  </HEADLINE>
By WAIEL FALEH
<TEXT>
<P>
   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) -- U.N. economic sanctions against Iraq are
missing their target, hurting not President Saddam Hussein but
ordinary civilians, a group of U.S. activists said Sunday at the
end of a six-week experiment in living among the Iraqi working
class.
</P>
<P>
   Five members of the Chicago-based group, Voices in the
Wilderness, told a news conference at the Iraqi Trade Ministry that
their stay in a low-income district of the southern city of Basra
had shown them that sanctions crippled the ability of Iraqis to
have safe water and an adequate diet.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have been eating the same food they get in the rations and
drinking the same water people here drink,'' said Liza Gizzi, 31,
referring to the food rations distributed to compensate for the
shortages caused by the sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   ''The food was not enough and the water made us sick,'' said
Gizzi, from St. Paul, Minn.
</P>
<P>
   When the activists began living in al-Jumhouriya in Basra, 345
miles south of Baghdad, there were six of them. But Ken
Hannaford-Ricardi of Worcester, Mass., found the conditions
unbearable and, sick with diarrhea, left Iraq after two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Voices and other critics have said the sanctions imposed since
Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990 have prevented the flow of pumps, parts
and other means to repair the country's infrastructure. Electricity
works only intermittently. Systems for purifying drinking water and
processing sewage do not work.
</P>
<P>
   ''Children are dying because of the bad sewage and water
systems,'' said Tom Jackson, 40, from Dover, N.H., who was part of
the group living in Basra.
</P>
<P>
   ''My government and Britain are making these children lose the
most beautiful years of their life,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Bad water has created an epidemic of dysentery and infectious
diseases, resulting in thousands of child deaths. UNICEF says the
number of infant and child deaths in Iraq has doubled in the decade
since the sanctions began.
</P>
<P>
   The United States and Britain are the chief backers of
maintaining the embargo until Iraq proves it has eliminated its
weapons of mass destruction. Iraq says it has done so and refuses
to cooperate with U.N. disarmament inspectors. The inspectors have
accused the government of failing to make a full disclosure of its
weapons programs.
</P>
<P>
   Voices and other critics say the U.N. sanctions are the true
weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
   ''The American and British administrations are missing the
target with their sanctions the way their warplanes are missing
their targets when bombing Iraqi civilian properties,'' said Kathy
Kelly of Chicago, co-founder of Voices in the Wilderness.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. and British warplanes that patrol no-fly zones over north
and south Iraq frequently attack when challenged by Iraqi air
defense systems. Allied spokesmen say the planes attack only
military targets, but Iraq accuses them of bombing civilian sites.
</P>
<P>
   The activists, who are headed home, intend to start a campaign
on the Internet offering fans made of date-palm leaves, Kelly said.
</P>
<P>
   Iraqis use such fans to cool themselves when the power cuts make
it impossible to use electric fans and air-conditioners despite
stifling temperatures that rise to 120 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly said they would give fans to members of the U.N. Security
Council, the U.N. secretary general, U.S. presidential candidates
and the State Department officials on the Iraq desk.
</P>
<P>
   ''We want to remind each of these officials of the good they
could accomplish by revising these insidious policies,'' Kelly
said.
</P>
<P>
   The other members of the group were Lauren Cannon, 30, from
Dover, N.H., and Mark McGuire of Winona, Minn.

<HEADLINE> Serb Prisoners Escape in Kosovo  </HEADLINE>
By MERITA DHIMGJOKA
<TEXT>
<P>
   KOSOVSKA MITROVICA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- NATO-led peacekeepers and
U.N. police using dogs scoured northern Kosovo on Sunday to track
down Serb prisoners who escaped from a detention center after
overpowering the guards.
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen Kosovo Serbs, some of them facing charges of genocide
and crimes against humanity, fled from a U.N. facility in the
primarily Serb part of the divided city of Kosovska Mitrovica on
Saturday evening, said Susan Manuel, a U.N. spokeswoman. Two were
caught quickly, but the rest remained at large.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of NATO-led peacekeepers and U.N. police used dogs to
track the men through a wooded area near the jail. Troops threw up
roadblocks leading to Serbia proper, as the Serb escapees would be
unlikely to retreat toward the southern, predominantly ethnic
Albanian part of Kosovska Mitrovica.
</P>
<P>
   Manuel called the incident ''extremely serious'' and said it
would damage the reputation of NATO-led peacekeepers and the United
Nations in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a very bad signal for the rest of the people in
Kosovo, who had depended on us to bring people to justice from the
war of last year,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations' top representative in Kosovo, Bernard
Kouchner, expressed anger and frustration with the ease in which
the men slipped away and ordered an immediate review of the
province's detention facilities.
</P>
<P>
   The men had been held since NATO-led troops took over the
southern Serb province last year and have been waiting for trial as
U.N. officials struggled to organize a justice system.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. officials and NATO peacekeepers have controlled Kosovo
since June 1999, after the end of a 78-day air war that forced
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic to end his crackdown on
ethnic Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   The escape took place at 8:45 p.m. when a U.N. policeman was
taking a prisoner back to his cell after the man had made a phone
call.
</P>
<P>
   The other detainees in the cell overpowered the policeman, beat
him and threatened him with a gun that had been smuggled into the
prison, a U.N. statement said. They snatched his keys and freed
other detainees from other cells.
</P>
<P>
   The escapees threatened the remaining guards with the gun, bound
them, and locked them inside a cell before fleeing. The officers
alerted troops after freeing themselves 90 minutes later.

<HEADLINE> For release 12:01 a.m. Monday, Sept. 4, &AMP; thereafter  </HEADLINE>
By ANDREW WELSH-HUGGINS
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) - Being turned off by a candidate can make
for more than heated lunch table talk. A new Ohio State University
study suggests that people are more likely to vote in a
presidential election if they strongly dislike one of the
candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ''In lots of areas of life people are much more motivated by the
threat of a loss than they are by the opportunity of a gain,'' said
Jon Krosnick, a professor of psychology and political science.
''The minute you've got a candidate you don't like, the possibility
of them winning is a threat and that motivates you to get out of
the house.''
</P>
<P>
   Krosnick and colleagues from Princeton, Northwestern University
and the University of Chicago studied data from U.S. presidential
elections collected from 1972 to 1988 by the National Election
Study.
</P>
<P>
   The surveys included face-to-face interviews with more than
5,000 voters. The National Election Study checked names at local
election boards to verify whether individuals voted.
</P>
<P>
   The analysis of voter turnout was part of a larger study that
applied psychological theory to voter decision-making.
</P>
<P>
   ''We saw support for a set of principles that we then carried
into a world of politics,'' Krosnick said. ''Is it possible people
evaluate candidates the way they evaluate breakfast cereals and
potential vacation spots? The answer is yes.''
</P>
<P>
   The study was presented at the American Psychological
Association's annual meeting earlier this summer and at the
American Political Science Association's annual conference Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Among the study's other findings:
</P>
<P>
   - First impressions count strongly in how voters decide on a
candidate.
</P>
<P>
   - Despite a perceived cynicism about politics, people hold out
optimism for potential new candidates.
</P>
<P>
   - Negative information has more impact on voters than positive.
</P>
<P>
   - Less knowledgeable voters make decisions about candidates in
the same way informed voters do.
</P>
<P>
   ''In contrast to the simple-minded presumption that people walk
into the voting booth and make a decision at that point, people are
forming impressions about a candidate all along during the
campaign,'' Krosnick said. ''Their impressions are driven more by
what people learned early about a candidate rather than what they
learned last-minute.''
</P>
<P>
   There's a lot of social psychological literature that indicates
that first impressions do count, ''and there's some supporting
evidence for that applied to politics,'' said William Berkowitz, a
psychology professor at the University of Massachusetts, Lowell
campus, who was not a member of the Ohio State study.
</P>
<P>
   Krosnick said there is nothing irresponsible about applying
everyday decision-making processes to electing a president.
</P>
<P>
   ''It simply shows how universal these principles of human
judgment are,'' he said. ''You don't have to be involved deeply in
the political domain to use a sophisticated style of reasoning.''

<HEADLINE> Bodies of 3 Workers Found in Grozny  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NAZRAN, Russia (AP) -- Russian troops in the Chechen capital
Grozny found the bodies of three emergency workers who had
apparently been shot and stabbed to death, a news report said
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The three Emergency Situations Ministry workers were found with
multiple gunshot and stabbing wounds in Grozny's Zavodskoi
district, the Interfax news agency said. The ministry handles civil
disasters and has a large compound in Grozny containing sleeping
quarters for dozens of staff and a field hospital.
</P>
<P>
   A ministry duty officer refused to comment on the report.
</P>
<P>
   The three workers were related to each other, Interfax said
without identifying them.
</P>
<P>
   Russian troops captured Grozny in early February after weeks of
air and artillery strikes, but have been unable to keep rebels from
filtering back into the city. Federal forces occupy about two
thirds of the republic.
</P>
<P>
   A Russian soldier was wounded Sunday near the city of Argun when
the convoy he was riding in came under fire, the news agency
ITAR-Tass reported.
</P>
<P>
   Also Sunday, Russian forces said they expected rebels to launch
a new operation around Sept. 6, when the insurgents celebrate the
1996 anniversary of the day they ousted Russian troops from
Chechnya at the end of a 1994-96 war.
</P>
<P>
   The federal command's press center said rebels would provoke
federal troops into bombing peaceful towns and try to assassinate
several pro-Russian Chechen officials in the republic.
</P>
<P>
   Russian forces have repeatedly warned that rebels were planning
attacks around holidays or events in Russia, but there have been no
major rebel attacks in weeks.

<HEADLINE> Putin Praises U.S. Defense Decision  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- President Vladimir Putin on Sunday again praised
U.S. President Clinton for putting off deployment of a national
missile-defense system, saying he had ''raised the authority of the
United States'' by doing so.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Clinton announced he wouldn't give authorization to
begin deployment of a missile defense system. Clinton said
opposition from Russia, as well as China and other nations, played
a large role in the decision.
</P>
<P>
   Putin, speaking on a trip to Russia's Far East before flying to
Japan Sunday, said he had no doubt that Clinton's decision was made
because of American interests, but that he hoped ''that the
position of Rusia was taken into account,'' the Interfax news
agency reported.
</P>
<P>
   The decision was ''important for international safety and raises
the authority of the United States,'' Putin said.
</P>
<P>
   Russia had vehemently opposed the U.S. plan because it would
have involved amending or scrapping the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile
Treaty, which Russia considers a cornerstone of world stability.
Russian leaders also said a missile defense would spark a new arms
race.

<HEADLINE> Tension mounts between condo owners and their associations  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEWARK, N.J. (AP) - A growing number of residents of condo
villages and town house developments in New Jersey have begun to
complain that the volunteer homeowners associations that run their
neighborhoods are operating beyond democratic control.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Connolly, the director of codes and standards for the state
Department of Community Affairs, said he now takes more complaints
about homeowners associations than landlords.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's amazing what goes on in some of these little
governments,'' Connolly told The Star-Ledger of Newark for Sunday's
editions. ''These associations carry out many of the functions of
government. They're little democracies. The idea is to make more
workable democracies out of them.''
</P>
<P>
   In many cases, the ''covenants'' of the associations carry as
much power as their township council.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the associations strictly regulate fence heights,
door colors, signs, flags. In some cases, banned items include
television antennas, pickup trucks and outdoor clotheslines.
</P>
<P>
   Those who break the rules face fines and, if they refuse to pay,
liens.
</P>
<P>
   Under New Jersey law, the associations are treated as nonprofit
corporations, rather than governmental bodies. Their leaders are
elected by residents and unpaid.
</P>
<P>
   The associations formed as a way to pass and maintain strict
rules that protect property values, and leaders say they are
reasonable in their requests and enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of the associations say the lack of regulation allows
the associations to enact arbitrary rules without any kind of
oversight.
</P>
<P>
   ''People feel they've been cut out of the democratic process,''
said Stan Maron, a resident of Galaxy Towers in Guttenberg. ''The
constitutional rights that apply to people living in a city don't
apply once they buy into a homeowners association.''
</P>
<P>
   Maron is president of the Common-Interest Homeowners Coalition,
a group of residents pushing reforms currently under consideration
by state legislators.
</P>
<P>
   The Department of Community Affairs also is supporting reforms
designed to make the associations more democratic.
</P>
<P>
   About 800,000 New Jersey residents live in association-run
complexes, some as large as small towns.
</P>
<P>
   An uproar came in a golf-course retirement community in
Middlesex County, called Clearbrook, when the association decided
to spend $3.7 million of residents' dues on a clubhouse project -
without their approval.
</P>
<P>
   After some sued and won, a bylaw was written to require
referendums on large expenses.
</P>
<P>
   Proposed legislation would require associations to have
independent panels handle disputes, and would name the Department
of Community Affairs as the final arbiter.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal also requires associations to hold elections using
secret ballots, which would be counted by someone outside the
organization. They also would have to open financial records and
take bids for large contracts.
</P>
<P>
   Associations are watching the proposed reforms with some
concern.
</P>
<P>
   ''You're dealing with all volunteers. It's pretty much a
thankless job, and basically, somebody has to do it,'' said Phyllis
Matthey, who runs a group of association leaders called the
Coalition of Associations for Political Action. ''If you get to
heavy-handed, people will resign and the places will fall apart.''

<HEADLINE> NJ Transit shortfall raises doubts about future rail projects  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEWARK, N.J. (AP) - New Jersey Transit's recent disclosure of a
possible $2.2 billion funding shortfall over the next five years is
raising doubts about the prospects for several major rail projects.
</P>
<P>
   Among them are a passenger line linking Monmouth, Ocean and
Middlesex counties, a rail extension to Phillipsburg in Warren
County, a Gloucester County light rail line and a light rail system
serving Elizabeth in Union County.
</P>
<P>
   All have been pitched to the transit agency by county officials
and passenger rail advocates, but none has been funded.
</P>
<P>
   Skeptics fear the agency's financial situation may force it to
focus exclusively on maintaining existing service and financing
projects already under way.
</P>
<P>
   ''The long-range projects are interesting - they are important -
but they would have problems if they diverted money from their core
programs in order to pay for the long-range things,'' Martin
Robins, director of Rutgers University's Transportation Policy
Institute, told The Star-Ledger of Newark for Sunday's editions.
</P>
<P>
   NJ Transit leaders say money will be found for essential
projects.
</P>
<P>
   ''I happen to believe that necessity is the mother of
invention,'' said Executive Director Jeffrey Warsh.
</P>
<P>
   The agency's report warning of a revenue shortfall is based on
no increase in federal and state funding and no fare increase. More
funding in any of those areas could help produce money for new
projects, officials say.

<HEADLINE> French Protest Fuel Prices  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS (AP) -- French truck drivers and farmers on Sunday were
preparing to block fuel refineries and storage areas nationwide,
the latest development in a national wave of protests over rising
fuel prices.
</P>
<P>
   The Transport Ministry said negotiations with truck drivers'
unions were ongoing, but truckers said they had suspended the talks
this weekend to ready for the blockades, expected to start
overnight.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have fundamentally, totally and exclusively dedicated
ourselves to organizing the protest,'' Jean-Paul Deneuville, a
representative of the National Federation of Truck Drivers, told
France-Info radio.
</P>
<P>
   Protesters planned to target sites nationwide, from Bayonne near
the Spanish border to Dunkirk in the north to Strasbourg in the
eastern Alsace region.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, French fishermen blocked ports and staged
demonstrations until they reached an agreement with the Agriculture
Ministry on Thursday to help offset their fuel prices.
</P>
<P>
   Farmers, truck drivers and taxi drivers added their voices to
the protests over the soaring French fuel prices, which have risen
on the back of skyrocketing crude prices.
</P>
<P>
   French truckers say the cost of diesel fuel has risen 40 percent
in the past year to about $2.55 per gallon, compared to a current
average of $1.58 francs per gallon in the United States. After
Britain, France has the highest fuel taxes in the European Union.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike fishermen, farmers and taxi drivers, truck drivers
receive little compensation for fuel taxes. They say fuel costs
them 7 percent of their revenues, when it should amount to only 2
percent.

<HEADLINE> Greece PM: Economy Is on Right Track  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   THESSALONIKI, Greece (AP) -- In an effort to separate the
prospects of the Greek economy from the stock market's recent
tumble, Premier Costas Simitis said Sunday that the stock
exchange's ups and downs aren't indicative of the economy's course.
</P>
<P>
   ''The stock market is a market and the government shouldn't
intervene in a market.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking at a press conference at the International Trade Fair
in Thessaloniki, the Greek premier said, however, that more
transparency in the investment programs of the listed companies is

   ''My firm belief is that companies should make public their
investment plans,'' Simitis said.

   The government has faced criticism that it hasn't enacted
legislation that would monitor the way profits from share capital
increases or initial public offerings are used.
</P>
<P>
   Simitis expressed confidence that the stock market's long-term
course will be positive, but said participants should be careful
with their investment choices.

<HEADLINE> Lazio rejects complaints that he's not campaigning hard enough  </HEADLINE>
By RICHARD PYLE
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -Shrugging off reported complaints by Republican
leaders that he's not campaigning hard enough, GOP Senate candidate
Rick Lazio said Sunday he is ''very comfortable with where we are
in key parts of this state.''
</P>
<P>
   Lazio, mingling with bathers and lunchgoers at a beach club in
Rockaway, Queens, said people should remember that he entered the
race only three months ago, after Mayor Rudolph Giuliani withdrew,
and that he still must devote some time to his role as a member of
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Despite those handicaps, Lazio said he was confident that voters
would prefer him over the Democratic contender, first lady Hillary
Rodham Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it is very apparent that as long as I communicate my
mainstream record, we will win this race,'' he said. ''My opponent
cannot say anything positive about New York. She cannot cite
anything she's ever done for the state of New York.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that left Mrs. Clinton with ''no option other than to
attack.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton spokesman Howard Wolfson said Lazio ''entered this race
by attacking Mrs. Clinton, and just put up one of the most negative
ads of the cycle this past week. We will continue to talk about our
positive message.''
</P>
<P>
   The Daily News reported Sunday that unidentified Republican
party strategists were ''frustrated'' by the ''passive'' pace of
Lazio's campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Several Lazio supporters at the beach club agreed that his
campaign has been a bit on the lazy side. ''I think he needs to do
a little more,'' said Helen Muchewicz.
</P>
<P>
   ''She (Clinton) is working hard. He's got to get out there a
little more,'' agreed Muchewicz's son in law, Frank Keating.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio was warmly received at the Breezy Point Surf Club, whose
5,000 members are mostly middle class, many of them retired civil
servants, and largely Democratic. He called it the kind of audience
he was looking for. ''This is not a club for the rich and famous,''
he aid.
</P>
<P>
   On his lunchtime tour of the dining room and around the pool,
many members told Lazio they planned to vote for him or had not
made up their minds. If there was a consistent theme, it was
animosity toward Clinton as an interloper in New York politics.
</P>
<P>
   ''I hope you beat the pants off her,'' Therese Bennett, 75, a
retired phone company employee, told the grinning Lazio. ''I can't
stand her. What the hell gives her the right to run in New York?''
</P>
<P>
   ''What are we going to do with that Hillary?'' asked another
woman.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're going to work together,'' Lazio replied.
</P>
<P>
   Eileen O'Brien, a registered nurse from Brooklyn, who identified
herself as a delegate to the recent Democratic party convention
''but not for Hillary,'' engaged Lazio in a lengthy poolside
discussion on election issues, beginning with the ''salient
differences between yourself and the other candidate.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Experience, ability to get the job done, be effective working
for New York in a bipartisan way. ... There are plenty of issues
but a lot of it is just being a legislator, knowing how to get the
job done,'' Lazio replied. He then itemized his views on taxes,
health care and education.
</P>
<P>
   Though a Democrat, O'Brien said she disagreed with Mrs. Clinton
on some issues, and with ''the notion that she can just come into
New York'' to run for the U.S. Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ''I believe that she doesn't necessarily want to be a senator
from New York, she wants to be a senator, and I think she sees it
as most expeditious within our state. If she thought it was most
expeditious in Illinois, she probably would have been the candidate
from there,'' O'Brien said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about Mrs. Clinton's recent intercession to keep convicted
Israeli spy Jonathan Pollard from being moved to a tougher federal
lockup, Lazio said he thought the action proper and the decision
correct, but declined to voice a position on clemency for Pollard -
a sensitive issue in the Jewish community. Clinton has not taken a
position on clemency, either.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio said only the president can decide on clemency, and if it
was denied by either President Clinton or a successor, ''they
should release to the public the underlying reasons and the facts
of why there was a denial.''

<HEADLINE> Israel Politician Jailed for Bribes  </HEADLINE>
By RON KAMPEAS
<TEXT>
<P>
   RAMLE, Israel (AP) -- Arieh Deri, the founder of a party of the
dispossessed who rose to the status of kingmaker and a crucial
peace talks player, went to jail Sunday, swearing his three-year
sentence for bribetaking would bring a religious revolution.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of Deri's followers accompanied him to prison gates,
where they compared him to Nelson Mandela, biblical Joseph betrayed
by his brothers and Jewish martyrs who swore their allegiance to
holy writ while they burned on pyres.
</P>
<P>
   Deri, 41, called on his followers to continue his work bringing
poor Jews of Middle Eastern background over to the strict Orthodoxy
that the Shas party espouses. Under that platform, Shas has
increased its power from four seats in parliament in 1984, when it
was established, to 17 today. It is now the third largest party.
</P>
<P>
   He predicted his jail stay would galvanize the movement, and led
a chant of a toll-free number set up to take calls from followers
reporting secular Jews. Shas activists would then reach out to the
nonbelievers.
</P>
<P>
   ''He is innocent!'' his followers chanted along in a parking lot
outside Nitzan Prison, just east of Tel Aviv. Some wept, others
fainted.
</P>
<P>
   Turnout was far lower than organizers had anticipated -- about
20,000 people instead of the touted hundreds of thousands. Last
week, activists had gleefully warned of ''hours'' of rioting; the
rally broke up as soon as Deri left the stage.
</P>
<P>
   Some blamed police for blocking supporters from arriving.
Government officials dismissed the claims, and said the numbers
reflected the drop in Deri's popularity following his resignation
from the party last year, after his conviction.
</P>
<P>
   ''People don't like to identify with a criminal,'' Justice
Minister Yossi Beilin told Israel television.
</P>
<P>
   While it had nothing to do with the sentencing, Prime Minister
Ehud Barak's government was a favorite target at the rally. Barak
has become unpopular with Shas supporters because of his recent
declaration that he would introduce a secular constitution to
Israel, undermining rabbinical authority in areas of marriage and
divorce.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, Barak further enraged Shas legislators when his
Cabinet voted to dismantle the Religious Affairs Ministry. Barak
says the ministry -- most recently held by Shas -- has become a
bloated bureaucracy aimed mainly at keeping party activists
employed. Parliament, which is in recess until October, must
approve the move.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the day Sunday, two police were injured in clashes,
police said, and three Shas activists were detained for throwing
stones -- a blotter that pales in comparison to other demonstrations
in this protest-intensive country.
</P>
<P>
   The protest highlight emerged not from Deri supporters, but from
a daredevil paraglider who floated above the crowd bearing the
slogan ''Number One Thief'' on his wings, prompting lusty boos from
the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Shas leaders seemed ambivalent about showing support for Deri.
</P>
<P>
   Rabbi Ovadiah Yosef, the party's spiritual leader -- once Deri's
mentor -- barely looked at Deri and spoke only briefly, and then to
urge the crowd to behave. He left quickly, before Deri spoke.
Deri's successor as party political leader, Eli Yishai, did not
even speak, instead sitting stone-faced, surrounded by security
guards assigned him a few months ago when he began getting death
threats for not voicing enough support for Deri.
</P>
<P>
   It was a pronounced changed from when Deri entered politics in
1984. Barely in his 20s, he was seen as a brilliant young star who
strove to reconcile religious and secular Jews, as well as
Sephardic Jews of Middle Eastern origin who had been neglected by
the state for years with the European Jewish establishment.
</P>
<P>
   With an ever-ready smile, he was a novelty: a handsome young
spokesman for a sector most Israelis regarded with suspicion.
</P>
<P>
   Most significantly, he nudged Yosef into issuing a
groundbreaking religious ruling that said saving lives was more
important than keeping territory. For the first time, advocates of
talks with the Palestinians had religious ammunition. The prospect
of handing over territory rove the nation, and after the 1992
elections Deri's Shas -- now kingmaker -- crowned the dovish Yitzhak
Rabin prime minister, setting the stage for the Oslo accords.
</P>
<P>
   That same year, Deri was indicted for accepting bribes from
contractors for favorable treatment while he was interior minister.
He was finally sentenced in a lower court only in 1999. He appealed
to the Supreme Court, and this year it reduced his sentence from
four years to three.
</P>
<P>
   Some in Shas, including Yosef, blamed Deri for drawing out the
process through his refusal to cooperate with the police. Yosef
also believed Deri was cultivating a personality movement; his
conviction became the centerpiece of last year's elections.

	   NEW HAVEN, Conn. (AP) - While the economy boomed during the
1990s, incomes for Connecticut's poorest workers shrank more than
anywhere else in the country, according to a new report.
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut workers making the least amount of money saw their
incomes plummet 26 percent between 1988 and 1998, from an average
of $23,775 annually to $17,615, according to a report by New
Haven-based Connecticut Voices for Children and the Economic Policy
Institute in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   The $6,160 drop, adjusted for inflation, was the highest in the
nation. The second worst state was Rhode Island, where workers with
the lowest incomes saw their annual pay shrink by an average of
$3,781 over the past 10 years, the report says.
</P>
<P>
   The report also notes that the percentage of Connecticut workers
earning poverty-level wages increased in the past decade.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the state's wealthiest workers made 18 percent
more money, a jump from an average $148,011 annual income to
$174,149.
</P>
<P>
   The report, ''The State of Working Connecticut 2000,'' uses data
from the state Department of Labor, the U.S. Census Bureau and
other sources to assess incomes, taxes, wages, unemployment, wealth
and poverty. It was released to coincide with the Labor Day
holiday.
</P>
<P>
   A national report also is being unveiled by the Economic Policy
Institute, a nonpartisan think tank that issues a state-by-state
labor report card every two years.
</P>
<P>
   Worsening poverty in Connecticut is largely due to the decline
of the manufacturing industry, said Shelley Geballe, president of
Voices for Children and author of the Connecticut report. Geballe
said she is alarmed to see poverty worsening in the nation's
richest state during a time of economic recovery.
</P>
<P>
   Roger Therrien, director of research for the state Department of
Labor, said he was not surprised by the report's findings.
</P>
<P>
   ''In addition to being the state with the highest per-capita
income... it's also been well publicized that we have five of the
poorest cities in the country. There is a gap there,'' Therrien
said.
</P>
<P>
   The labor department has initiatives underway to help
Connecticut workers find jobs and advance to higher-paying
positions, Therrien said.
</P>
<P>
   Rachel Heerema, executive director of the Life Haven shelter for
homeless pregnant women in New Haven, said the rift between the
rich and poor has long been evident in the city.
</P>
<P>
   ''The report documents what we've seen on a small scale at Life
Haven,'' Heerema said. ''Even with welfare reform, we've noticed
the declining wages among poor families, and that poverty-level
wages for workers have become more common.''

<HEADLINE> Suspicious fire claims one life, injures six  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP)- A suspicious fire that started early Sunday
morning in the Bedford-Stuyvesant section of Brooklyn claimed a
teen-ager's life and injured six other people, fire officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The fire began shortly before 7 a.m. in a three-story
residential building with a business on the first floor and was
burning full force when firefighters arrived minutes later, said
Firefighter Robert Calise.
</P>
<P>
   One resident, Armony Bevel, 18, was declared dead at the scene
and two others, a woman in her 60s and a 34-year-old man, were
injured, the woman in critical condition with burns and the man in
stable condition, said Detective John Giammarino, a police
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Four firefighters were brought to Kings County Medical Center
with injuries and were all in stable condition, Calise said.
</P>
<P>
   The fire was deemed suspicious and was under investigation
because of its heavy volume and the speed with which it spread,
Calise said.

<HEADLINE> Report: Kidnappers, Victim Argued  </HEADLINE>
By KOMAKO AKAI
<TEXT>
<P>
   ZAMBOANGA, Philippines (AP) -- Muslim rebels who took an American
man hostage in the southern Philippines did so after he angered
them in an argument over religious issues at their jungle camp, a
newspaper reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ''There was a scuffle, and suddenly, Schilling had become a
hostage,'' free-lance reporter Arlyn de la Cruz quoted a rebel as
saying in the Philippine Daily Inquirer.
</P>
<P>
   Jeffrey Schilling of Oakland, Calif., went to the camp
voluntarily, the paper reported. He was held by the Abu Sayyaf
rebels inside a bamboo hut guarded by 10 to 15 men when de la Cruz
visited Friday.
</P>
<P>
   His hands had been tied with electrical wire since Tuesday, when
he damaged the door to the hut while shouting that he needed
cleaning solution for his contact lenses, it said.
</P>
<P>
   The Abu Sayyaf, which says it is fighting for an independent
Islamic state, is also holding six other Westerners and 12
Filipinos on Jolo Island. The group freed six hostages last week
for a reported $6 million ransom, paid by Libya. It freed other
hostages earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Schilling is held on Jolo by another Abu Sayyaf faction,
however, one responsible for kidnapping about 50 schoolchildren and
teachers in March on neighboring Basilan Island.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the teachers were beheaded after the United States
ignored the group's demand for the release of several Arab
terrorists held in U.S. jails. The faction also tortured and killed
a Catholic priest.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen plans to discuss Shilling's
abduction and cooperation in the fight against terrorism during a
planned two-day visit to Manila starting Sept. 15, Philippine
Defense Secretary Orlando Mercado said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen will meet President Joseph Estrada, Mercado and top
military officials during the visit, which is part of a series of
worldwide goodbye trips by top officials with the outgoing
government of President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels demanded $10 million for Schilling's release
Thursday, then said Saturday that they would make political
demands. The U.S. State Department has ruled out paying ransom.
</P>
<P>
   Schilling, 24, converted to Islam several years ago and has been
living in southern Zamboanga city since March with a Muslim
Filipino woman, Ivi V. Osani.
</P>
<P>
   Osani is the second cousin of rebel spokesman Abu Sabaya and
reportedly was married to a rebel who died several years ago. She
says she and Schilling married in a Muslim ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   Osani, who is in protective custody in a hospital, said Sabaya
invited her and Schilling to visit the camp on Jolo, near
Zamboanga.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper said the rebels wanted to talk to Schilling about
buying night vision goggles and weapons for them in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   Schilling had planned to return to California on Sunday,
reportedly to prepare for Osani to move there with him.
</P>
<P>
   Schilling angered the rebels in arguments on Aug. 28 over such
issues as the age at which Muslim boys should be allowed to use
weapons and whether tribal distinctions should be retained after
the establishment of an Islamic state in the Philippines, the paper
said.
</P>
<P>
   Philippine Red Cross officials are seeking clearance from the
Abu Sayyaf and the military to deliver food and medicine for
Schilling. U.S. officials say he is seriously ill and needs regular
prescription medicine, but the nature of his condition was not
clear.
</P>
<P>
   Also Sunday, police rescued three quarry workers abducted last
month by outlaws on a southern Philippine island, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Police are saying the abductors belong to the Abu Sayyaf, but
rebel leaders say the kidnappers belong to one of many bandit
groups roaming Jolo, an impoverished island about 600 miles south
of Manila.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, three Malaysians held hostage for four months by the
Abu Sayyaf at Jolo remain friends with their former kidnappers and
have regular contact with them, a local newspaper reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Diving instructor Ken Fong and forestry officials Basilius Jim
and Baln Krishnan Nair, who were released on Aug 18, said they
regularly receive phone calls from their captors, the Abu Sayyaf.

<HEADLINE> Clinton To Press Mideast Peace at UN  </HEADLINE>
By LAWRENCE L. KNUTSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton will use this week's
millennial town meeting of the world's leaders as an opportunity to
restart the Middle East peace process while advocating a faster,
more effective United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   With virtually all the world's leaders at the table in New York
City for the U.N. Millennium Summit, the president will promote his
own diplomatic agenda, especially on the Middle East, according to
White House officials who spoke on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   The president also will sketch plans on how the world body could
become quicker in dealing with international crises, the officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   During the summit, which runs Wednesday through Friday, Clinton
will seek to engage many of the 150 world leaders expected to
attend.
</P>
<P>
   On the schedule are face-to-face encounters with Russian
President Vladimir Putin, President Jiang Zemin of China, a number
of regional leaders, and the two key players at the deadlocked
Middle East peace talks -- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
   The president's efforts to broker an Israeli-Palestinian peace
settlement during talks at Camp David in July ended in deadlock.
</P>
<P>
   Through individual meetings and in speeches, Clinton will have
the chance to engage with a host of leaders, discussing issues
including the Middle East peace process, the spread of weapons of
mass destruction and the Balkans, one White House official said.
</P>
<P>
   There is speculation that Clinton might encounter -- on purpose
or by accident -- such leaders as Cuba's Fidel Castro or Iranian
President Mohammad Khatami. But there are no such sessions on the
president's public schedule.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton will deliver the summit's opening address, underscoring
the need for the United States to stay engaged around the world and
to find effective ways of addressing what one official called ''new
and very different kinds of security challenges.''
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, he is expected to address the situation in Sierra
Leone where a peace agreement has been signed but where conflict
has not ended, a White House official said.
</P>
<P>
   And he is expected to discuss efforts to control the AIDS virus,
especially in Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also is expected to endorse new tools and new resources
for the United Nations in an effort to sharpen its future role in
responding to world crises, preventing conflict and restoring
peace.
</P>
<P>
   In places such as Bosnia and Kosovo, ''the U.N, has done good
work but gotten off to a slow start,'' the White House official
said. He said Clinton will likely suggest ways to respond to needs
more quickly and effectively.

<HEADLINE> Pope Beatifies Disputed Pius IX  </HEADLINE>
By ELLEN KNICKMEYER
<TEXT>
<P>
   VATICAN CITY (AP) -- Pope John Paul II advanced two predecessors
toward sainthood Sunday in one of the most disputed such acts of
his papacy, beatifying the 19th century's much-attacked Pius IX
alongside the 20th century's much-beloved John XXIII.
</P>
<P>
   Jews bitterly protested John Paul's recognition of Pius, who
over history's longest papacy confined Jews to Rome's ghetto,
condoned the church seizure of a Jewish-born boy and allegedly
referred to Jews as ''dogs.''
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli government itself expressed ''deep sorrow,''
especially in light of the progress John Paul's own 22-year papacy
has made in Catholic-Jewish relations.
</P>
<P>
   John Paul acknowledged the rancor, calling Pius ''much loved,
but also hated and slandered.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Beatifying a son of the church does not celebrate particular
historic choices that he has made, but rather points him out for
imitation and for veneration for his virtue,'' said John Paul,
repeatedly stressing Pius' faithfulness to the church rather than
his actions toward the world outside of it.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 100,000-strong crowd of kerchiefed, banner-waving
pilgrims filled St. Peter's Square to the colonnades for the
beatifications, attended by black-clad leaders of Italy's most
staunchly Catholic noble families and political circles.
</P>
<P>
   On the eve of the ceremony, hundreds of Rome's Jews and
Catholics held a candlelight vigil to protest the beatification,
which is the last formal step before possible sainthood.
</P>
<P>
   Elena Mortara, whose great-great uncle was taken from her Jewish
family by Pius' papal guards in 1858, called the beatification the
''reopening of a wound.''
</P>
<P>
   The church seized the 6-year-old Edgardo Mortara upon hearing a
Catholic housemaid secretly had baptized him. Edgardo grew up to
enter the priesthood under Pius' patronage.
</P>
<P>
   One frequently cited remark has Pius referring to Jews as
''dogs,'' and declaring that ''of these dogs, there are too many of
them present in Rome.'' Pius presided over what was Europe's last
enforced Jewish ghetto until the Nazi era.
</P>
<P>
   Israel's minister for Diaspora Affairs, Rabbi Michael Melchior,
expressed ''deep sorrow'' Sunday-- conveying a tone of
disappointment repeatedly heard from Jews in the wake of the
beatification.
</P>
<P>
   Recalling John Paul's pilgrimage to Jerusalem's Western Wall in
March, Melchior said, ''as someone who saw the visit as a positive,
historical turning point, I would expect the Vatican to show
greater sensitivity toward the believers of other religions.''
</P>
<P>
   The New York-based Anti-Defamation League called the
beatification ''troubling.''
</P>
<P>
   Pius' tumultuous 1846-1878 papacy saw the violent breakup of the
centuries-old papal states. Noble-born Italians, of which he was
one, gave him the name ''The Last King Pope.''
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, Italians today still know the jovial, jowly,
peasant-born John XXIII simply as ''The Good Pope.''
</P>
<P>
   As the Vatican's envoy to Turkey during World War II, John is
credited with saving thousands of Jews with transit visas and other
assistance -- although at one point he complained of a ''convoy of
Jews'' heading to Palestine and its holy sites.
</P>
<P>
   John died of stomach cancer in 1963 less than five years into
his papacy. Weeks before his death, he issued the heartfelt ''Pacem
in Terris'' (Peace on Earth) encyclical that set recognition of
human rights as essential for world peace. Pius had condemned
emerging civil rights in his own 1864 encyclical.
</P>
<P>
   Both popes presided over the only two Vatican councils of modern
times -- Pius' enshrining the dogma of papal infallibility, John's
ushering in 1960s' liberalizations such as allowing Masses in local
languages rather than Latin.
</P>
<P>
   ''Divine design has willed the shared beatification of these two
popes who lived in very different historical contexts,'' John Paul
stressed Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ''Pope John remains in the memory of all in the image of a
smiling face and two arms thrown open in an embrace of the entire
world,'' John Paul told pilgrims -- many of whom had come from
across Italy for John's beatification in particular.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's loved for his good will and his simplicity,'' said
Lucrezia Gentile, who traveled from Calabria in southern Italy,
where Catholics have been stringing ribbons and banners days in
advance of the beatification.
</P>
<P>
   ''Pius IX lived in a very critical period,'' said another
pilgrim in the square, Delfina Candi, defending Pius IX without
being asked. ''It's not like today. Today it's easy.''
</P>
<P>
   John Paul beatified three others Sunday: Tommaso Reggio, a
19th-century Italian bishop who founded the Congregation of the
Sisters of St. Martha -- and who strongly criticized Pius IX's ban
on Catholic involvement in politics; Guillaume-Joseph Chaminade, a
French priest who in 1800 founded the Marianist Family; and
Joseph-Aloysius, an Irish monk who, as Columba Marmion, served as
abbot of the Benedictine Maredsous Abbey in Belgium in the early
20th century.
</P>
<P>
   John Paul has beatified and canonized more people than all of
his predecessors combined, believing firmly in presenting diverse
role models for the world's faithful.

<HEADLINE> Tropical Storm Ernesto weakens into a depression  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MIAMI (AP) - Tropical Storm Ernesto deteriorated into a
depression Sunday afternoon, and was not expected to regenerate,
forecasters said.
</P>
<P>
   The winds accompanying Ernesto dropped to 35 mph Sunday, below
the tropical storm threshold of 39 mph. Strong vertical winds high
in the atmosphere weakened the storm, said Miles Lawrence,
hurricane specialist with the National Hurricane Center in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   At 5 p.m. EDT, the depression's poorly organized center was
located near 20.0 north latitude, 59.0 west longitude, or about 300
miles east-northeast of the northern Leeward Islands.
</P>
<P>
   The storm was about 1,200 miles east-southeast of the Florida
coast and moving west-northwest near 17 mph.
</P>
<P>
   Ernesto, which formed early Saturday, was the fifth named storm
of the 2000 hurricane season.

<HEADLINE> Astros 9, Braves 3  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON (AP) -- Mitch Meluskey homered twice and Wade Miller won
for the third time in his last four decisions as the Houston Astros
beat the Atlanta Braves 9-3 Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves have lost five of seven and eight of 11, but still
hold a half-game lead in the NL East over the New York Mets, who
lost 4-3 in 11 innings to St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   Meluskey led off the fourth with a homer off Andy Ashby (8-12)
and hit a two-run shot in the eighth for his first career
multihomer game. Meluskey has three homers in the last two games.
</P>
<P>
   Miller (4-5) gave up two runs, nine hits and three walks in
seven innings. He struck out seven.
</P>
<P>
   Ashby (8-12), who lost his fourth straight decision, gave up
five runs and eight hits in 3 2-3 innings. He did not walk or
strikeout a batter. Ashby left his last start Tuesday after six
innings against the Reds with a blood blister on the middle finger
of his pitching hand.
</P>
<P>
   B.J. Surhoff led off the second inning for Atlanta with a triple
and scored on Javy Lopez's groundout for a 1-0 lead. Keith
Lockhart's RBI single in the fourth made it 2-0.
</P>
<P>
   Meluskey's first homer started a five-run fourth inning for
Houston. Jeff Bagwell, Lance Berkman and Moises Alou followed with
singles to tie it at 2. Richard Hidalgo added an RBI double, Chris
Truby had a run-scoring groundout, and Bill Spiers had an RBI
infield single to knock out Ashby.
</P>
<P>
   Truby's sacrifice fly made it 6-2 in the fifth.
</P>
<P>
   Spiers singled to center, driving in Julio Lugo in the eighth
and Meluskey followed with his 14th homer.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Meluskey's 14 homers are the most by an Astros catcher
since Craig Biggio's 13 in 1989. ... Rafael Furcal has at least one
walk in seven straight games. ... In losing the series 2-1, Atlanta
has dropped six of its last 10 series.

Bush Agrees to Three Presidential Debates
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- George W. Bush announced today that he has agreed to
three prime-time, presidential debates with rival Al Gore that could begin as
early as next week. The Republican presidential candidate said he is willing to
debate his Democratic rival Sept. 12 during a special prime-time edition of
NBC's ''Meet the Press;' Oct. 3 in Los Angeles on CNN's ''Larry King Live;'' and
Oct. 17 at Washington University in St. Louis. The proposal also includes two
vice presidential debates: Oct. 11 in Winston-Salem, N.C., and a later forum yet
to be decided, Bush said. Only one of the debates Bush has agreed to was
proposed by a special bipartisan commission, which had proposed three encounters
between Bush and Gore.

Gore, Lieberman Kick Off Campaign Dash
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Al Gore and Joe Lieberman today brought sandwiches --
cheesesteaks, of course -- for a night construction crew as the Democrats
stepped off on a manic 24-hour dash through five states designed to catch the
workingman's eye. ''Nobody's going to work harder for the American people,''
Gore, the Democratic presidential nominee, said in an interview on the running
mates' extraordinary Labor Day kickoff. With that image, superimposed on the
grueling schedule for this swing, Gore hoped to cramp Republican rival George W.
Bush's support -- so far unbudging in polls -- among working-class men,
particularly white men. Gore told The Associated Press his goal was to ''honor
the families that work hard to pay the bills and make ends meet.''

Workers Say Internet Is a Vital Tool
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- For many Americans, Internet access is not just a workplace
distraction, but a key component of their jobs, a new report says. About 37
percent of all full-time workers -- or 38 million people -- now have Internet
access at their jobs, and they're using it primarily for work-related research
and e-mail, says the report by the Pew Internet &AMP; American Life Project. Lee
Rainie, director of the project, says polling of workers shows that about
two-thirds of those with access to the Web on the job go online at least once a
day. Nearly three-quarters of workers with access say the Internet has improved
their ability to do their jobs.

Clinton Plans Mideast Peace Push at U.N.
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton will use this week's millennial town
meeting of the world's leaders as an opportunity to restart the Middle East
peace process while advocating a faster, more effective United Nations. With
virtually all the world's leaders at the table in New York City for the U.N.
Millennium Summit, the president will promote his own diplomatic agenda,
especially on the Middle East, according to White House officials who spoke on
condition of anonymity. The summit schedule, which runs Wednesday through
Friday, includes meetings with Russian President Vladimir Putin, President Jiang
Zemin of China, a number of regional leaders, and the two key players at the
deadlocked Middle East peace talks -- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat.

   NAPA, Calif. (AP) -- The heart of Northern California's wine country was
sharply jolted early today by an earthquake that smashed windows and glassware
and knocked out power to thousands. ''It was like someone was just holding the
house and shaking it violently,'' said Alison Saether, who said plaster fell
from the ceiling of her Napa home. ''We were so panicked we couldn't even
move.'' The quake hit at 1:36 a.m. and measured a magnitude 5.2. It was centered
about 6 miles northwest of Napa, near the small town of Yountville, according to
the U.S. Geological Survey in Menlo Park.

   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) -- Billionaire businessman Rafik Hariri and his allies
appeared to be handily defeating Lebanon's prime minister and his backers in
elections Sunday, according to early unofficial returns, putting Hariri on
course for a possible clash with the president. Hariri, a former prime minister
who tried to rebuild Lebanon following its devastating civil war, hopes to once
again lead the government of Lebanon, where political fortunes depend heavily on
the desires of neighboring Syria. Residents of the former Israeli-occupied zone
in the south voted for the first time in nearly 30 years.

Report: Redskins, Davis Reach Deal
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Stephen Davis, the NFC's leading rusher last season,
reached an agreement with Washington on a contract the team said would make him
a ''life-long Redskin.'' Terms of the agreement, which was finalized one day
before the start of the regular season, were not disclosed. The Washington Post
reported in its Sunday editions that the agreement was likely worth $90 million
over nine seasons, including a $6.5 million signing bonus. However, his salary
could be reduced if he does not meet certain performance standards, the
newspaper said.

<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Frank Thomas hit his 40th homer and drove in four
runs as the Chicago White Sox needed to rally in the eighth inning
despite scoring nine runs in the first to win their fifth straight
game, 13-12 over the Anaheim Angels on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago led 9-4 after one before coming back from a 12-11
deficit in the eighth Shigetoshi Hasegawa (8-5). Carlos Lee doubled
with one out and scored on Herbert Perry's triple to tie the game.
Paul Konerko hit a sacrifice fly to right to go ahead 13-12.
</P>
<P>
   Hasegawa, who couldn't hold an 8-5 lead Friday, blew his second
save in the series. Hasegawa entered the series having given up
just one earned run in his previous 34 1-3 innings
</P>
<P>
   Kelly Wunsch (5-3) pitched two innings for the win. Keith Foulke
pitched the ninth for his 27th save in 32 opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas hit an RBI double and a two-run double in the first as
the White Sox scored nine runs off Ramon Ortiz, who retired only
two batters in the shortest outing in his 22-start career. Thomas
added a solo shot in the sixth to draw Chicago within 11-10. It is
the fourth 40-homer season for Thomas, who hit only 15 in an
injury-riddled 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Troy Glaus set an Angels record by hitting his 40th home run,
one of five homers by Anaheim. Tim Salmon and Scott Spiezio each
hit three-run homers and Darrin Erstad hit a pair of solo shots.
</P>
<P>
   Salmon homered in the sixth, his 32nd, off rookie Matt Ginter to
put the Angels ahead 10-9. One out later, Glaus followed with his
40th off Ginter to break the club mark of 39 set by Reggie Jackson
in 1982.
</P>
<P>
   Erstad hit his 12th career leadoff homer in the first off
starter James Baldwin and led off the seventh against Kelly Wunsch
with his 23rd homer. It was Erstad's third multihomer game this
year and fifth of his career.
</P>
<P>
   Spiezio matched a career high with four RBIs, hitting a
sacrifice fly in the first and a three-run homer, his 14th, in the
third.
</P>
<P>
   The White Sox, the top offensive team in the AL, scored 35 runs
in the three-game series and posted their first sweep of the Angels
at home since April 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Garret Anderson hit a two-run double and scored on Spiezio's
sacrifice fly to give Anaheim a 4-0 in the first.
</P>
<P>
   The White Sox scored nine in their half. Thomas hit an RBI
double and a run scored on a wild pitch by Ortiz. Magglio Ordonez
hit a sacrifice fly and Konerko hit an RBI single to tie the game
at 4.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Johnson hit a two-run single and Ray Durham added an RBI
double, his second hit in the inning, to make it 7-4. Jose Valentin
walked and Thomas followed with his second double to make it 9-4
and knock out Ortiz.
</P>
<P>
   Baldwin, making his second start since being sidelined 12 days
with a tired arm, gave up seven runs on five hits and six walks
over 2 1-3 innings in his shortest outing of the season.
</P>
<P>
Notes: The White Sox also scored nine runs in the first inning on
June 18 against the Yankees. Their high for most runs in an inning
is 11 April 18 against Seattle in the fourth. The White Sox have
batted around in an inning 31 times this season. ... Anaheim's Kent
Mercker, who left Saturday's game after two innings, has a strained
left shoulder and is day to day. ... The Angels have hit four or
more homers a club-record 11 times this year. ... Erstad's homer
was the first by a left-handed batter off Wunsch this year.

<HEADLINE> Arafat Demands East Jerusalem  </HEADLINE>
By MARIAM FAM
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) -- Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat told Arab
foreign ministers on Sunday that he would not accept a peace deal
with Israel that did not give the Palestinians control of
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat, speaking at Sunday's opening of a two-day gathering of
Arab League foreign ministers, vowed to keep working for a
Palestinian state with its capital in Jerusalem, but did not say
when he might declare statehood.
</P>
<P>
   He made no reference to a Sept. 13 deadline he had previously
set for the declaration. He has since said he is reconsidering the
date. Arafat reportedly is under pressure to allow more time for
negotiations with Israel after the failure of a U.S.-mediated peace
summit in July.
</P>
<P>
   Israel has indicated it might annex parts of the West Bank and
Gaza Strip in response to a declaration of a Palestinian state
outside a peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ''We will not accept an agreement that ends the conflict without
getting back all the rights given to us by international
resolutions and our lands and holy places,'' Arafat told the
session.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are going forward with great determination and willingness
toward our independence and national sovereignty over our
Palestinian lands and establishing our independent Palestinian
state and its capital holy Jerusalem, the heart of Palestine, heart
of Arabs and heart of believers,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute over east Jerusalem, which Israel seized in the 1967
war and declared part of its capital, derailed the Camp David
summit in July and has hampered efforts to revive those talks.
</P>
<P>
   At Camp David, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak offered
Palestinians limited control over east Jerusalem, but Arafat held
out for sovereignty. The eastern sector of the city contains the
third-holiest Islamic shrine as well as sites sacred to Jews and
Christians.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat and Barak are scheduled to discuss the peace process in
separate meetings with President Clinton on the margins of the U.N.
Millennium summit in New York this week.
</P>
<P>
   A draft resolution prepared by Arab League Secretary-General
Esmat Abdel-Meguid backs Arafat on his claim to Jerusalem and his
plans to declare statehood, but urges a resumption of the peace
talks. The draft also urges the United States to double its efforts
to reach a ''just and comprehensive solution'' to the
Palestinian-Israeli conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Yousef bin Alawi, Oman's foreign minister, handed over the
rotating chairmanship of the Arab League foreign minister's group
Sunday to Palestinian representative Farouk Kaddoumi.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan's King Abdullah II, who meets Clinton on Wednesday, added
his endorsement to Palestinian claims in Jerusalem in an interview
published in the country's four dailies Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The king, who gave the interview to the papers' editors Friday,
vowed to support the Palestinians ''with all our might and
potential, backing their efforts to regain their legitimate rights
and establish their independent state on their national soil with
Jerusalem as its capital.''
</P>
<P>
   Jordan ruled east Jerusalem for 17 years ending with Israel's
seizure of the territory in the 1967 Middle East War.
</P>
<P>
   The Vatican's ambassador to Egypt, Monsignor Paolo Giglio, also
attended the Arab League session Sunday as an observer. Giglio
reiterated the Vatican's position that Jerusalem requires
international oversight -- a stance neither the Israelis nor the
Palestinians have backed.

<HEADLINE> Gun Control Advocates Go After Bush  </HEADLINE>
By LAWRENCE L. KNUTSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Bringing their van tour to Washington, gun
control advocates on Sunday assailed GOP presidential candidate
George W. Bush, blaming him for legislation that permits concealed
handguns virtually anywhere, including churches, hospitals and
amusement parks.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Barnes, president of Handgun Control, called Bush's record
on gun issues ''dangerous'' and said it is matched by what he
called ''absolutely bizarre'' votes against gun control in Congress
by his vice presidential running mate, Dick Cheney.
</P>
<P>
   Standing in Lafayette Square with the White House as a backdrop,
Barnes and allies said they will discuss Bush's record on guns at
length during a tour this fall of states likely to be decisive in
November's presidential election.
</P>
<P>
   Stops already have been made in New Jersey and Pennsylvania and
are scheduled for Ohio, Michigan, Indiana, Illinois and Missouri,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes noted a Texas law that makes it easy for citizens to
carry guns into churches, synagogues, hospitals, nursing homes and
amusement parks.
</P>
<P>
   ''I guess he believes you need your gun in case you are attacked
by your minister, or if a nurse in a nursing home goes berserk,''
Barnes said.
</P>
<P>
   Nina Butts, a lobbyist for Texans Against Handgun Violence,
said: ''Gov. Bush has been a dream come true for the National Rifle
Association. What the NRA wants, Gov. Bush supports. What the NRA
doesn't want, Gov. Bush defeats.''
</P>
<P>
   Barnes said that as a GOP congressman from Wyoming, Cheney was
one of only 21 House members to vote against a ban on so-called
''cop-killer'' bullets and just one of four voting against banning
plastic guns which many call a favorite of terrorists because they
have no metal parts to set off metal detectors at airports and
other security checkpoints.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, Bush approved a measure allowing Texans to be licensed
to carry concealed weapons. Bush called it another weapon in the
fight against crime. ''This is a bill to make Texas a safer
place,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, Bush signed a bill making changes in that law. Among
them, it prevented prosecution of licensed gun owners for illegally
carrying guns into churches unless they were given verbal or
written notice that it wasn't allowed.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign responded with a dig at Vice President Al
Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ''If any one's record on guns is dangerous it is the record of
the Clinton-Gore administration and its failure to enforce and
prosecute our gun laws,'' said Ray Sullivan, a spokesman for the
Bush campaign. ''Gov. Bush has signed tough laws in Texas cracking
down on juveniles and holding parents responsible for making
weapons inaccessible to children.''

<HEADLINE> Cardinals 4, Mets 3  </HEADLINE>
By R.B. FALLSTROM
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Jim Edmonds beat the New York Mets with a home
run for the second time in three days, connecting in the 11th
inning Sunday as the St. Louis Cardinals completed a three-game
sweep with a 4-3 victory.
</P>
<P>
   The NL Central-leading Cardinals have won seven of eight and are
5-0 in extra innings overall. The Mets swept St. Louis twice
earlier in the season, but lost all three games of this series by
one run on the final at-bat.
</P>
<P>
   Edmonds hit a ninth-inning homer on Friday, and Fernando Vina
hit a game-winning single on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, Edmonds led off the 11th by hitting a 1-1 pitch from
Rick White (5-8) over the right field wall for his 38th homer.
</P>
<P>
   White was in his fourth inning of relief.
</P>
<P>
   Matt Morris (3-3) allowed two hits in two innings and got the
win. He got Mike Piazza to ground into an inning-ending double play
after singles by Mike Bordick and Edgardo Alfonzo in the 10th, and
retired the side in order in the 11th.
</P>
<P>
   Cardinals manager Tony La Russa tried to finesse the ninth with
a two-run lead, using three pitchers, but Bubba Trammell foiled the
strategy with a two-out, two-run homer to tie it 3-3.
</P>
<P>
   Trammell, who also drove in the Mets' first run in the fifth,
hit a 2-1 pitch from Dave Veres over the wall in left center for
his third homer since joining New York from Tampa Bay.
</P>
<P>
   Pinch-hitter Placido Polanco's three-run homer in the eighth had
given the Cardinals the lead. Polanco hit his fourth home run on an
0-1 pitch from Dennis Cook after Turk Wendell walked Edgar Renteria
and gave up a hit-and-run single to Mike Matheny to open the
inning.
</P>
<P>
   Cook retired only one of the four batters he faced in the
seventh inning on Friday as the Cardinals tied the score in an
eventual 6-5 victory.
</P>
<P>
   New York began Sunday a half-game behind NL East-leading
Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Glendon Rusch allowed four singles in seven scoreless innings
for the Mets. He struck out seven and didn't walk a batter for the
ninth time in 25 starts.
</P>
<P>
   Cardinals rookie Rick Ankiel also was dominant despite the
98-degree heat, allowing one run and two hits in seven innings to
match his season-best outing. Ankiel was perfect over the first
three innings, recording six of his eight strikeouts.
</P>
<P>
   Ankiel has earned the win in only two of his last 13 starts, but
the Cardinals have won his last six outings.
</P>
<P>
   A misplay by Cardinals first baseman Craig Paquette helped the
Mets score in the fifth. Paquette hesitated with the ball when
Ankiel had Jay Payton picked off first with two outs in fifth.
</P>
<P>
   Payton ended up with a stolen base and scored on Trammell's hit,
the first of the game for the Mets.
</P>
<P>
   Matheny was 2-for-3 to extend his hitting streak to a
career-best 11 games. He's 16-for-36 (.444) during the streak.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Will Clark didn't start for the second straight day with a

<HEADLINE> Weather Delays Cardinals-Giants Game  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- The NFL season opener between the
Arizona Cardinals and New York Giants was suspended for 23 minutes
by lightning early in the third quarter Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants were getting ready to punt after failing to pick up a
first down on the opening series of the second half when a bolt of
lightning flashed near the west end of Giants Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The legs of Giants rookie receiver Ron Dixon seemed to turn to
jelly after the bolt, and referee Bill Carollo immediately waved
his arms in the air and sent the teams off the field into the
tunnels under the stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants might have run faster, conscious of a lightning
strike that knocked five University of Albany police officers off
their feet during training camp.
</P>
<P>
   ''I wasn't wasting any time,'' defensive end Michael Strahan
said after the Giants finished off a 21-16 win. ''After the
training camp incident, I wasn't going to be the poster child for
lightning.''
</P>
<P>
   The players warmed up briefly after returning to the field.
</P>
<P>
   ''I would say it was a little distracting because you usually
don't have to go back in and come back out,'' Giants coach Jim
Fassel said. ''It was the same for both teams.''
</P>
<P>
   The Giants led 14-0 on two first-half touchdown runs by Tiki
Barber when play was stopped.
</P>
<P>
   NFL spokesman Joe Browne said there were two other ligthning
delays in NFL history. A game at Giants Stadium between the Jets
and Colts was delayed 32 minutes on Sept. 8, 1996, while a contest
in Kansas City between the Seattle Seahawks and Chiefs was delayed
54 minutes on Oct. 4, 1998.

<HEADLINE> Dolphins 23, Seahawks 0  </HEADLINE>
By STEVEN WINE
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- Even without Dan Marino, the Miami Dolphins had the
better quarterback Sunday. They also had the better running game
and better defense.
</P>
<P>
   Jay Fiedler threw for 134 yards and Lamar Smith ran for 145 in
their Dolphins debuts, and Miami forced six turnovers to beat the
Seattle Seahawks 23-0 Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The opener was Miami's first without Marino since 1983, and he
was hardly missed. While Fiedler went 15-for-24 with no turnovers,
Seattle counterpart Jon Kitna threw four interceptions and lost a
fumble before being benched early in the third period.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, a 29-year-old journeyman who has twice been released by
NFL teams, carried 27 times and repeatedly took advantage of
blocking by rookie tackle Todd Wade. Olindo Mare, who set an NFL
record last year with 39 field goals, went 3-for-3, with kicks from
48, 25 and 30 yards.
</P>
<P>
   The shutout was the Seahawks' first since a 19-0 loss to the Los
Angeles Raiders on Oct. 18, 1992. Sam Madison intercepted Kitna
twice, Kenny Mixon knocked off Ricky Watters' helmet with a tackle,
and Seattle never reached the Miami 30.
</P>
<P>
   New Dolphins coach Dave Wannstedt improved to 2-11 against
Seattle's Mike Holmgren. Their previous games came when Wannstedt
coached the Chicago Bears and Holmgren the Green Bay Packers.
</P>
<P>
   Wannstedt was the target of second-guessing when he chose
Fiedler to start over last year's backup, Damon Huard, and even
Marino questioned the decision. But Fiedler acquitted himself well
in his first game with his fifth NFL team, helping the Dolphins
score on their first four possessions en route to a 23-0 halftime
lead.
</P>
<P>
   Kitna went 6-for-13 for 54 yards and committed turnovers on
Seattle's first four possessions. He was replaced early in the
third period by Damon Huard's brother, Brock.
</P>
<P>
   The scheme unveiled by new Miami offensive coordinator Chan
Gailey had the Seahawks on their heels from the first possession.
Fiedler completed a pair of third-down passes and Smith carried
nine times for 39 yards, including the final 4, in an 80-yard
touchdown drive.
</P>
<P>
   Interceptions by Madison on Seattle's first two possessions set
up field goals to make it 13-0. Kitna mishandled a snap, and Jason
Taylor recovered to set up another field goal for a 16-0 lead. All
three turnovers came in Seahawks territory.
</P>
<P>
   The rematch of last year's first-round playoff thriller, also
won by Miami, became a laugher when Fiedler hit Oronde Gadsden with
a 16-yard touchdown pass 43 seconds before halftime.
</P>
<P>
   Not everything worked for the Dolphins' offense. Receiver Bert
Emanuel lined up at quarterback and handed off to Smith for a first
down on third-and-1, but the play was negated by a penalty for
illegal substitution.
</P>
<P>
   And Miami fans shouldn't buy Super Bowl tickets just yet. The
Dolphins have won their opener each of the past nine years, but
have only two AFC East titles during that span.

<HEADLINE> Iran Delays Review of Alleged Spies  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) -- An Iranian appeals court is delaying for the
second time decisions on its review of the jail terms of 10 Jews
convicted of spying for Israel, state-run radio reported Sunday
night, quoting a senior judiciary official.
</P>
<P>
   The second review was apparently delayed for the same reason as
the first: the judges hadn't agreed on whether all the charges that
resulted in convictions constituted crimes, said Hossein Ali Amiri,
the judiciary chief of southern Fars province where the men were
tried.
</P>
<P>
   The main charges on which a lower court convicted the 10 were
espionage, cooperating with the Zionist regime and participation in
an illegal group. Defense lawyers had argued during the trial that
there is no definition of or punishment for espionage under Iranian
law.
</P>
<P>
   The 10 were convicted July 1 and sentenced to prison terms of
four to 13 years. Three others were acquitted. The case has
attracted international scrutiny, with critics questioning whether
the closed-door trial was fair; there was no jury and the judge
also acted as prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
   Originally, Amiri was reported as saying that the appeals court
would issue its verdicts by Aug. 21. Last month, he said the
verdicts were expected by Sept. 5. In Sunday's report, he said
there would be no decision by Tuesday, but he did not specify a new
date.

<HEADLINE> Russian Leader Wants Sub Raised  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- Raising the sunken nuclear submarine Kursk, a
complicated and costly operation, is necessary because of radiation
concerns, Deputy Prime Minister Ilya Klebanov said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   If the submarine were left at the bottom of the Barents Sea,
where it sank on Aug. 12, ''the public, and not only ecologists,
would remain alarmed,'' Klebanov said on RTR television's weekly
news magazine program Zerkalo.
</P>
<P>
   The submarine sank following a devastating explosion and the
blast's damage raised concerns that there could be a leak of
radioactive material from the ship's reactor. No increases in
radiation in the area have been reported.
</P>
<P>
   Klebanov, who heads the commission investigating the cause of
the disaster, said that raising the submarine would be an
''extremely complicated process'' but that Russia wanted to
complete it within a year.
</P>
<P>
   The government has provided no details on how the lifting would
take place, or on how the cash-strapped government can bear the
burden a project estimated to cost up to $100 million.
</P>
<P>
   Klebanov also reiterated the government's intention to begin an
operation to recover the bodies of the Kursk's 118 crewmen in late
September. In that operation, holes are to be cut in the
submarine's hull, allowing divers to enter to extract the corpses.
</P>
<P>
   The cause of the accident has not been determined. Russian
officials have focused on the contention that the Kursk collided
with another object, possibly a foreign vessel or a World War
II-era mine.
</P>
<P>
   Some observers have said the most likely cause was a torpedo
exploding inside the ship.
</P>
<P>
   On Zerkalo, Russian Baltic Fleet commander Vladimir Yegorov said
the possibility of a torpedo explosion ''has not been excluded,''
but suggested that the explosion could have been touched off by a
collision.

<HEADLINE> Raiders 9, Chargers 6  </HEADLINE>
By ANNE M. PETERSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) -- The Oakland Raiders provided the scoring.
Ryan Leaf provided the drama.
</P>
<P>
   Leaf was battered and even bloodied, with three interceptions
and two fumbles, as the San Diego Chargers fell 9-6 to the Raiders
on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Andre Rison caught a 10-yard scoring pass from Rich Gannon with
2:53 left to give Oakland the winning margin.
</P>
<P>
   Leaf, making his first NFL regular-season appearance in 20
months, had led the Chargers on a 15-play, 80-yard drive that ended
with Robert Chancey's 3-yard run. A two-point conversion failed.
</P>
<P>
   Leaf hit 17 of 39 passes for 180 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Rison, making his regular-season debut with the Raiders, had
five catches for 49 yards. Gannon was 20-of-35 for 176 yards. He
was sacked four times.
</P>
<P>
   Neither team scored until 7:23 of the third quarter. With the
Chargers on their 1-yard line, Darrell Russell tackled Chancey in
the end zone for a safety.
</P>
<P>
   Later in the same quarter, the second of Leaf's fumbles was
recovered by Oakland defensive end Regan Upshaw -- although the
Raiders couldn't capitalize on the turnover. Leaf recovered his
first fumble himself.
</P>
<P>
   Leaf also had three turnovers in his last NFL game on Dec. 13,
1998, at Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Leaf did not connect on his first two passes of the game and was
6-of-19 at the half. Midway through the first quarter, he backed up
on a play and appeared to simply fall over -- for a loss of 6 yards.
</P>
<P>
   On San Diego's third series of the game, Leaf effectively moved
the ball to the Oakland 34. But a pass tipped off the fingers of
receiver Curtis Conway and into the hands of Oakland safety Marquez
Pope.
</P>
<P>
   Leaf got a scare in the first quarter when Upshaw flagrantly hit
him after an incomplete pass to Conway. Upshaw was charged with a
late hit and Leaf was on the ground for about three minutes,
surrounded by trainers. , He was led off the field and replaced by
Moses Moreno -- for just two plays before Leaf returned with blood
on his jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Leaf also left the game briefly in the third quarter after a
hard hit by Tony Bryant.
</P>
<P>
   Last season, Leaf injured his shoulder last season at the start
of training camp and did not play.
</P>
<P>
   He also had his share of trouble off the field, including a
monthlong suspension for cursing the Chargers' then-general manager
Bobby Beathard, and run-ins with the media and fans.
</P>
<P>
   But Leaf said in the preseason he put his past behind him, and
he unseated Jim Harbaugh for the starting job.
</P>
<P>
   Sebastian Janikowski, taken by the Raiders with the 17th overall
pick in the draft, made his NFL debut and missed his first field
goal. Janikowski's 41-yard attempt late in the first half went wide
left. Later, the first kicker taken in the first round since 1979
stood alone on the sidelines with his head bowed.
</P>
<P>
   Rison was released by the Kansas City Chiefs with just two weeks
left in preseason and picked up by the Raiders a week later to
complement receiver Tim Brown. He did a nice job of it Sunday.

<HEADLINE> United States 97, U.S. Select 31  </HEADLINE>
By GORDON SAKAMOTO
<TEXT>
<P>
   HONOLULU (AP) -- Nell Forner became the U.S. women's basketball
team's career victory leader Sunday with the Olympic-bound squad's
blowout victory over the U.S. Select team.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. team, using its fast break to perfection and a swarming
defense that forced turnovers and airballs, beat the Select team
97-31.
</P>
<P>
   The victory was Fortner's 89th as coach of the national team,
giving her one more than Tara VanDerveer.
</P>
<P>
   It was the biggest winning margin for the United States team
that first came together last September, bettering its 57-point
victory over Stephen F. Austin last December. Since regrouping in
August, Team USA has won five games by an average of 41.4 points.
</P>
<P>
   Chamique Holdsclaw scored 14 points, Lisa Leslie and Yolanda
Griffith each had 12, Sheryl Swoopes and DeLisha Milton added 11
each, and Ruthie Bolton-Holifield had 10. The U.S. team was
42-of-62 from the field (68 percent).
</P>
<P>
   The Olympians used a 36-6 run to take a 50-17 lead at the half.
</P>
<P>
   Leslie had eight points in the half, Griffith and Swoopes six
apiece and Bolton-Holifield added five.
</P>
<P>
   For awhile, there was a danger the All-Stars wouldn't break into
the double figures in the first half. But Jackie Stiles' free throw
made it 40-10 with 3:37 left in the half.
</P>
<P>
   Two more runs, 14 points to open the second half and 13 late in
the game helped build the margin to 66 points with 4:48 left.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. team limited the Select squad to 21-percent shooting
(11-of-53), forced 25 turnovers and had 15 steals.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly Schumacher led the Select team with eight points, and
Jackie Stiles added seven.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. team now move on to Australia for four exhibition games
before opening the Olympics against South Korea on Sept. 16.

   The late night blast at a Jaguar dealership in the Rendi

<HEADLINE> Democrats Plan 27-Hour Campaign Dash  </HEADLINE>
By SANDRA SOBIERAJ
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Al Gore and Joseph Lieberman brought
sandwiches -- cheesesteaks, of course -- for a Sunday night
construction crew as the Democrats began a manic 27-hour dash
through five states designed to catch the working man's eye. ''You
are what this campaign is all about,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   Running mate Lieberman pledged, ''No one will work harder for
the hard-working middle class families of America than Al Gore and
Joe Lieberman. Give us a chance.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House hopefuls, launching their extraordinary Labor
Day tour, carried in about 100 of Pat's ''King of Steaks''
specialties, then used Styrofoam slabs to cushion the plastic tubs
fashioned into dinner chairs. Lieberman, an Orthodox Jew, only
pretended to nibble on the non-kosher meal.
</P>
<P>
   With an eye on the 22-page itinerary, dubbed ''Al and Joe's Hard
Day's Night Tour,'' Lieberman joked: ''I'm beginning to think vice
presidential candidates should have collective bargaining rights.''
</P>
<P>
   Union workers, mostly white men and some in hard hats, cheered
''Go Al, go!'' It was unclear how many were actually on duty this
holiday weekend or were part of a drummed-up union crowd.
</P>
<P>
   But with that image, superimposed on the grueling schedule for
this swing, Gore hoped to cramp Republican rival George W. Bush's
support -- so far unbudging in polls -- among working-class men,
particularly whites.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you want a job done right on our economic policies take a
look at the blueprint,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Joe and I are offering a blueprint that will keep our budget
balanced, keep investing in new jobs ... keep interest rates low,
pass middle-class tax cuts, make sure that our prosperity enriches
not just the few but all of our families,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Gore said he ''will not accept the blueprint from the other side
that proposes to give away all of the (budget) surplus in a giant
tax cut for the wealthy.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, in an interview, Gore told The Associated Press his
goal was to ''honor the families that work hard to pay the bills
and make ends meet. ... They're the ones I want my presidency to be
about.''
</P>
<P>
   But Republicans want it to be about Gore's credibility, as
highlighted in a new television ad that began airing over the
weekend. It features Gore's 1996 visit to a Buddhist temple and his
1999 claim to have created the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if there was an alternative message Gore would like to
send voters, he replied: ''I'm for campaign finance reform and I am
for using our current prosperity to make sure that everybody
benefits from new advances in e-commerce.''
</P>
<P>
   In Philadelphia, Banani Scott, 29, an electrician working three
jobs to support two kids and the kind of guy Gore is after, was
unimpressed.
</P>
<P>
   ''These guys are running around to show the people, 'We're down
with 'em,' then the next three or four years we won't see hide nor
hair of them. Nothing will change for me,'' said Scott, who added
he doesn't like Bush either.
</P>
<P>
   Torrential rain ruined plans to drop by a south Philadelphia
block party, so Gore and Lieberman settled for pizza at Doc's Union
Pub.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Pizzo, 55, a teacher who was enjoying a few drinks, said
Gore on this sprint is ''demonstrating what he can do under strain,
demonstrating his physical prowess and mental acumen.''
</P>
<P>
   At the top of the long day, Lieberman told reporters that any
explicit comparison to the pace of the GOP ticket will be up to the
American people and news media to draw.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're going out to be with people who are actually working out
there and say that, while we know a lot of them have benefited from
the good economic times, we also understand a lot of them are
working very hard to make ends meet,'' Lieberman said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're going to be with them and fighting for them.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush spokesman Dan Bartlett retorted: ''Twenty-four hours of
campaign promises cannot erase eight years of inaction on tax cuts
for working families, prescription drugs for our seniors, and a
'real' patients bill of rights.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore's communications director, Mark Fabiani, said it was
serendipity that Gore and Lieberman's ''work-athon'' would wind
through the key electoral battlegrounds of Pennsylvania, Michigan,
Florida, Kentucky and Illinois as Bush has had to defend the pace
of his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ''When we planned this, we didn't know what Bush was doing. It's
hard to believe he has such a light Labor Day schedule, but that's
his choice,'' Fabiani said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush still made news Sunday, announcing he had agreed to three
debates with Gore. For the Labor Day holiday, which traditionally
kicks off the quadrennial fall campaign for the White House, Bush
planned one stop in Naperville, Ill., and another in Romeo, Mich.
</P>
<P>
   After Philadelphia, the Democrats were headed to heavily
blue-collar Flint, Mich., to greet night shift workers at Hurley
Medical Center.
</P>
<P>
   Next, was Tampa, Fla., for a 5 a.m. Monday breakfast with
firefighters and a pair of nostalgic sidetrips -- Gore to an
all-night diner like the one where his mother waitressed; Lieberman
to a bakery because his dad drove a bakery delivery truck.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, the two were to split up, with Gore flying to the
Pittsburgh Labor Day parade and rally with AFL-CIO President John
Sweeney, then to Louisville, Ky., for an evening rally at the motor
speedway. Lieberman was breaking off for Detroit and Peoria, Ill.
</P>
<P>
   The centerpiece of Gore's campaign week is an economic address
Wednesday in Cleveland.

<HEADLINE> Colombia Rebel Violence Kills 35  </HEADLINE>
By MARGARITA MARTINEZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) -- A surge of rebel violence left 35 people
dead over the weekend following President Clinton's visit to
Colombia, including seven police officers slain by guerrillas --
some of whom were disguised as police.
</P>
<P>
   In the latest attack, leftist guerrillas from the Revolutionary
Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC, sneaked up on a police station
Saturday in northern Colombia, officials said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The assault took the small town of Tomarrazon by surprise, said
National Police operations director Gen. Tobias Duran.
</P>
<P>
   The guerrillas arrived in three trucks and a jeep, some dressed
in camouflage and others as police. Rebels shot to death the four
officers posted at the station and ambushed reinforcements as they
arrived, killing three more policemen, Duran added.
</P>
<P>
   Nine officers survived the attack, in which rebels also
destroyed the public telephone office in the town in Guajira State,
about 475 miles from the capital, Bogota.
</P>
<P>
   At least one FARC fighter died, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-seven other people were killed in heavy overnight clashes
that ended Saturday in western Colombia. Twelve of them were FARC
rebels.
</P>
<P>
   Seven airmen died when their U.S.-built AC-46 gunship, which was
sent to support ground troops, slammed into an Andean peak. At the
mountaintop communications complex they were protecting, eight
soldiers died in fighting with guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels were unable to take the complex, which controls
cellular and other telephone links to much of western Colombia.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's visit to the war-torn South American country was meant
to support President Andres Pastrana's fight against drug
traffickers and leftist rebels who protect drug crops. U.S. and
Colombian officials hope the $1.3 billion anti-narcotics aid
package will weaken the rebels and push them toward peace by
cutting into a major income source: taxes the FARC levies on the
cocaine trade.
</P>
<P>
   But some critics have said the aid, including helicopters and
troop training, is skewed toward the Colombian military, leaving
police forces increasingly vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
   Colombia's neighbors have also expressed fears that U.S. aid
will increase the intensity of the war and cause fighting and drug
crop cultivation to spill over the border.
</P>
<P>
   A Brazilian newspaper Sunday quoted a FARC commander as saying
the rebel group will not allow fighting to spill over the border
and that it plans to send a document to the governments of
neighboring Venezuela, Brazil, Ecuador, Peru and Panama to this
effect.
</P>
<P>
   ''We want to calm our neighbors,'' FARC commander Ivan Rios was
quoted as saying in Folha de Sao Paulo. ''The territory of our
struggle is Colombia. It is our position that our popular struggle
should be carried out within our country.''
</P>
<P>
   The FARC has stepped up attacks on rural police stations during
the past two months, killing dozens of officers as well as
civilians. At least 231 police have died in the line of duty this
year.
</P>
<P>
   FARC attacks continue nationwide despite peace talks begun with
Pastrana in January 1999. The negotiations to end a 36-year
conflict are proceeding slowly and without a cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, the Colombian navy intercepted a speedboat off its
Pacific coast on Sunday and seized three tons of cocaine, the navy
said. Two people were arrested in the operation, which turned up
more than a hundred packages stuffed with cocaine.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar Moves Against Opposition  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   YANGON, Myanmar (AP) -- Police and intelligence officers moved
against Myanmar's battered opposition party Sunday, surrounding the
homes of its leaders and effectively shutting down its nerve center
in a crackdown that has triggered international condemnation.
</P>
<P>
   The authoritarian military regime said senior members of the
opposition National League for Democracy party were ''requested to
stay at their respective residences.''
</P>
<P>
   The crackdown followed what the opposition said was the forced
end to a nine-day standoff between the military regime and
opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi.
</P>
<P>
   The 55-year-old Nobel Peace Prize winner and her National League
for Democracy party colleagues were returned to the capital
Saturday after spending nine days on a suburban roadside. Security
personnel had stopped her from traveling to the countryside for
political work, and she refused to return to Yangon, capital of
Myanmar, also known as Burma.
</P>
<P>
   At almost the same time, party headquarters in Yangon were
raided and senior party officials were confined to their homes.
</P>
<P>
   The incident was Suu Kyi's first attempt to travel outside the
capital in two years. The government had blocked four previous
attempts, most recently in 1998, when she spent 13 days in her car.
</P>
<P>
   British diplomats who tried to visit Suu Kyi and party deputy
leader Tin Oo at their homes Saturday were stopped by security
personnel, an embassy representative said. The British Embassy said
it would press the government for access to Suu Kyi and other party
leaders.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright condemned
the crackdown.
</P>
<P>
   ''The United States is outraged and strongly condemns the
Burmese authorities' treatment of Aung San Suu Kyi and her party
members and the violation of their fundamental human rights,''
Albright said in a statement Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ''We call on the Burmese authorities to allow normal access and
freedom of movement to Aung San Suu Kyi and other members of the
National League for Democracy,'' the statement said.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, the European Union condemned Myanmar's restrictions
on Suu Kyi's movement and freedom of expression, saying it deplored
the government's threatening measures.
</P>
<P>
   ''The European Union is very preoccupied with the political
situation in Rangoon and the forced return of Madame Aung San Suu
Kyi to the capital,'' said a statement issued by the French
presidency of the EU during a foreign ministers meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Also on Sunday, the United Nations weighed in, saying it was
deeply concerned by actions taken against Suu Kyi and her party
colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   ''Reports concerning further infringement of the freedom of
movement and the freedom of political expression are particularly
disturbing,'' said a statement from U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan's spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Suu Kyi has led the opposition movement in Myanmar since 1988,
when the military quashed pro-democracy demonstrations and asserted
its authoritarian rule.
</P>
<P>
   She has urged foreign pressure on the military regime and
repeatedly has been rebuffed in attempts to hold a dialogue with
Myanmar's rulers. She won the 1991 Nobel Peace Prize for her
nonviolent pro-democracy work.
</P>
<P>
   The military held an election in 1990, but refused to allow
Parliament to convene after the National League for Democracy party
won a landslide victory. Since then, Suu Kyi's party members have
suffered arrest and harassment.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement Sunday to The Associated Press in Bangkok, the
government said it was investigating the activities of 14
foreigners and a U.S. Congressional team that recently visited
party headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   The government said the party's executive committee members were
asked to stay at their homes and cooperate in the investigation.
None is under house arrest, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
   Security personnel were seen Sunday around the National League
for Democracy party headquarters and around the houses of Tin Oo
and other party officials.
</P>
<P>
   Party sources said party headquarters were raided early Saturday
and that police seized several documents.

<HEADLINE> Democrats Open 27-Hour Campaign Dash  </HEADLINE>
By SANDRA SOBIERAJ
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Al Gore and Joseph Lieberman brought
sandwiches -- cheesesteaks, of course -- for a Sunday night
construction crew as the Democrats began a manic 27-hour dash
through five states designed to catch the working man's eye. ''You
are what this campaign is all about,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   Running mate Lieberman pledged, ''No one will work harder for
the hard-working middle class families of America than Al Gore and
Joe Lieberman. Give us a chance.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House hopefuls, launching their extraordinary Labor
Day tour, carried in about 100 of Pat's ''King of Steaks''
specialties, then used Styrofoam slabs to cushion the plastic tubs
fashioned into dinner chairs. Lieberman, an Orthodox Jew, only
pretended to nibble on the non-kosher meal.
</P>
<P>
   With an eye on the 22-page itinerary, dubbed ''Al and Joe's Hard
Day's Night Tour,'' Lieberman joked: ''I'm beginning to think vice
presidential candidates should have collective bargaining rights.''
</P>
<P>
   Union workers, mostly white men and some in hard hats, cheered
''Go Al, go!'' It was unclear how many were actually on duty this
holiday weekend or were part of a drummed-up union crowd.
</P>
<P>
   But with that image, superimposed on the grueling schedule for
this swing, Gore hoped to cramp Republican rival George W. Bush's
support -- so far unbudging in polls -- among working-class men,
particularly whites.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you want a job done right on our economic policies take a
look at the blueprint,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Joe and I are offering a blueprint that will keep our budget
balanced, keep investing in new jobs ... keep interest rates low,
pass middle-class tax cuts, make sure that our prosperity enriches
not just the few but all of our families,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Gore said he ''will not accept the blueprint from the other side
that proposes to give away all of the (budget) surplus in a giant
tax cut for the wealthy.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, in an interview, Gore told The Associated Press his
goal was to ''honor the families that work hard to pay the bills
and make ends meet. ... They're the ones I want my presidency to be
about.''
</P>
<P>
   But Republicans want it to be about Gore's credibility, as
highlighted in a new television ad that began airing over the
weekend. It features Gore's 1996 visit to a Buddhist temple and his
1999 claim to have created the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if there was an alternative message Gore would like to
send voters, he replied: ''I'm for campaign finance reform and I am
for using our current prosperity to make sure that everybody
benefits from new advances in e-commerce.''
</P>
<P>
   In Philadelphia, Banani Scott, 29, an electrician working three
jobs to support two kids and the kind of guy Gore is after, was
unimpressed.
</P>
<P>
   ''These guys are running around to show the people, 'We're down
with 'em,' then the next three or four years we won't see hide nor
hair of them. Nothing will change for me,'' said Scott, who added
he doesn't like Bush either.
</P>
<P>
   Torrential rain ruined plans to drop by a south Philadelphia
block party, so Gore and Lieberman settled for pizza at Doc's Union
Pub.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Pizzo, 55, a teacher who was enjoying a few drinks, said
Gore on this sprint is ''demonstrating what he can do under strain,
demonstrating his physical prowess and mental acumen.''
</P>
<P>
   At the top of the long day, Lieberman told reporters that any
explicit comparison to the pace of the GOP ticket will be up to the
American people and news media. Gore seemed to draw a parallel with
the Philadelphia Eagles' ''messing with Texas'' upset Sunday of the
Dallas Cowboys, saying the game was ''a momentum builder and season
changer.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush spokesman Dan Bartlett retorted: ''Twenty-four hours of
campaign promises cannot erase eight years of inaction on tax cuts
for working families, prescription drugs for our seniors, and a
'real' patients bill of rights.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore's communications director, Mark Fabiani, said it was
serendipity that Gore and Lieberman's ''work-athon'' would wind
through the key electoral battlegrounds of Pennsylvania, Michigan,
Florida, Kentucky and Illinois as Bush has had to defend the pace
of his campaign.

Gore Rejects Bush's Debate Proposal
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- The presidential candidates squabbled over debate
schedules today as Republican George W. Bush announced he had accepted three
prime-time sessions. Democrat Al Gore rejected the plan, saying the formats
proposed by Bush could limit the audience and amount of face-to-face debate
time. Bush proposed debating Gore as soon as next week, or Sept. 12, during a
special edition of NBC's ''Meet the Press;'' Oct. 3 in Los Angeles on CNN's
''Larry King Live;'' and Oct. 17 at Washington University in St. Louis. The
proposal also includes two vice presidential debates: Oct. 11 in Winston-Salem,
N.C., and a later forum yet to be decided, Bush said.

Congress Prepares Firestone Hearing
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Congress opens hearings this week aimed at determining
when Bridgestone/Firestone Inc. and its customer Ford Motor Co. knew about tire
problems that have been linked to 88 deaths in U.S. accidents and more overseas.
The case was not attracting much attention when lawmakers went on summer break a
month ago, but the resulting media coverage, recall of 6.5 million tires and
government scrutiny in the United States and abroad have made the issue one of
the hottest on Capitol Hill with at least three hearings planned. ''This thing
is just getting uglier by the minute,'' said Ken Johnson, spokesman for Rep.
Billy Tauzin, R-La., who will preside over one of the hearings. ''It's turning
into sort of a tire-gate.''

Activists: Sanctions Hurt Iraqis
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) -- U.N. economic sanctions against Iraq are missing their
target, hurting not President Saddam Hussein but ordinary civilians, a group of
U.S. activists said Sunday at the end of a six-week experiment in living among
the Iraqi working class. Five members of the Chicago-based group, Voices in the
Wilderness, told a news conference at the Iraqi Trade Ministry that their stay
in a low-income district of the southern city of Basra had shown them that
sanctions crippled the ability of Iraqis to have safe water and an adequate
diet. ''We have been eating the same food they get in the rations and drinking
the same water people here drink,'' said Liza Gizzi, 31, referring to the food
rations distributed to compensate for the shortages caused by the sanctions.
''The food was not enough and the water made us sick.''

Pope Beatifies Controversial Pius IX
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   VATICAN CITY (AP) -- Pope John Paul II advanced two predecessors toward
sainthood Sunday in one of the most disputed such acts of his papacy, beatifying
the 19th century's much-attacked Pius IX alongside the 20th century's
much-beloved John XXIII. Jews bitterly protested John Paul's recognition of
Pius, who over history's longest papacy confined Jews to Rome's ghetto, condoned
the church seizure of a Jewish-born boy and allegedly referred to Jews as
''dogs.'' The Israeli government itself expressed ''deep sorrow,'' especially in
light of the progress John Paul's own 22-year papacy has made in Catholic-Jewish
relations. John Paul acknowledged the rancor, calling Pius ''much loved, but
also hated and slandered.''

Russian Leader Wants Nuclear Sub Raised

   MOSCOW (AP) -- Raising the sunken nuclear submarine Kursk, a complicated and
costly operation, is necessary because of radiation concerns, Deputy Prime
Minister Ilya Klebanov said Sunday. If the submarine were left at the bottom of
the Barents Sea, where it sank on Aug. 12, ''the public, and not only
ecologists, would remain alarmed,'' Klebanov said on RTR television's weekly
news magazine program Zerkalo. The submarine sank following an explosion and the
blast's damage raised concerns that there could be a leak of radioactive
material from the ship's reactor.

court, after waiting five hours for thunder, lightning and heavy downpours to
subside today in the U.S. Open. She reached the quarterfinals with a 6-2, 6-2,
53-minute romp past Magui Serna. The victory extended Williams' winning streak
to 23 matches, the longest of the year on the WTA Tour.

<HEADLINE> Barak Not Optimistic on Negotiations  </HEADLINE>
By LAURIE COPANS
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- Israel will not make any moves in peace
negotiations until the Palestinians show flexibility, Prime
Minister Ehud Barak told his Cabinet Sunday, ahead of President
Clinton's latest effort to reconcile the two sides.
</P>
<P>
   Barak told his ministers that no breakthrough with the
Palestinians is imminent. Clinton will meet separately Tuesday with
Barak and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, who will be in New York
for the U.N. Millennium summit.
</P>
<P>
   ''The prime minister emphasized that until now he didn't see any
signs of flexibility or openness from the Palestinian side that
could signify the possibility of the renewal of the negotiations,''
the official Cabinet minutes, released to the press, read.
</P>
<P>
   Talks on the stickiest issues blocking a final peace agreement
have faltered largely over the issue of Jerusalem. The three
leaders were unable to break the deadlock over the fate of the
disputed city at a U.S.-mediated summit in July.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton plans to press the leaders to clinch a deal before his
term as U.S. president ends in January.
</P>
<P>
   At July's Camp David summit, Barak went further than any other
Israeli leader in offering the Palestinians sovereignty over parts
of east Jerusalem, which Israel captured in 1967. But Arafat
rejected the proposal, insisting he get full control of the sector
of the city he wants to make the capital of a future state.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat adviser Nabil Abourdeneh insisted Sunday that Israel
should make the concessions. The sides stand before a
''crossroads'' in the negotiations, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Arafat will ask the American administration to put pressure on
Israel,'' Abourdeneh told reporters upon Arafat's return to Gaza
from a meeting of the Arab League in Cairo. ''The coming days will
be a test of Israeli seriousness and to know the American position
regarding the peace process.''
</P>
<P>
   Channel Two television reported Sunday that Barak would be
willing to surrender sovereignty over Muslim and Christian holy
sites in Jerusalem's Old City -- but only if the areas would not be
controlled by the Palestinians. Barak would also be willing to give
the Palestinians some control in the walled city's Muslim quarter,
the TV said.
</P>
<P>
   Israel Army radio reported late Sunday that Israeli Foreign
Minister Shlomo Ben-Ami left the country for secret talks in an
undisclosed location but did not provide details. Spokesmen for
Ben-Ami were not immediately available for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat told Arab foreign ministers at the Arab League Sunday
that he would declare a Palestinian state but did not give an exact
date. His advisers have said he will not make a unilateral
announcement on Sept. 13 -- the deadline for a final peace agreement
-- but will put it off until November with the hope a treaty can be
reached by then.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are going forward with great determination and willingness
toward ... establishing our independent Palestinian state and its
capital holy Jerusalem, the heart of Palestine, heart of Arabs and
heart of believers,'' Arafat said.

<HEADLINE> Convicted Saudi Man Beheaded  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   RIYADH, Saudi Arabia (AP) -- A Saudi man convicted of drug
trafficking was beheaded Sunday, the Interior Ministry said.
</P>
<P>
   Madi Rbaihan Hamad al-Jamili was executed in the eastern
province of Hafer el-Baten for smuggling an unspecified quantity of
hashish into the kingdom, the ministry said.
</P>
<P>
   No other details were given.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's execution brings the number of people beheaded in the
kingdom this year to at least 92. At least 99 people were executed
last year.
</P>
<P>
   Executions are carried out with a sword in a public square.
Saudi Arabia follows a strict interpretation of Islamic law, which
prescribes death sentences for murder, rape, drug trafficking and
armed robbery.
</P>
<P>
   Human rights organizations have criticized the executions,
saying the accused rarely receive a fair trial and that Islam calls
for limited use of execution as punishment.

<HEADLINE> A Delightful Dasher Wins AA Derby  </HEADLINE>
By PETE HERRERA
<TEXT>
<P>
   RUIDOSO DOWNS, N.M. (AP) -- A Delightful Dasher gave his owner
and trainer another scare and won another big race.
</P>
<P>
   The 3-year-old gelding overcame a sluggish start with a huge
closing run to win Sunday's $225,000 All American Derby.
</P>
<P>
   A Delightful Dasher became only the fourth horse since 1974 to
win the All American Futurity as a 2-year-old and return the next
year to win the derby. The All American Futurity began in 1959 and
the derby was first run in 1974.
</P>
<P>
   This year's futurity will be run Monday.
</P>
<P>
   A Delightful Dasher, as he often does, spotted the competition
an early lead. He was bumped by two other horses a couple of jumps
away from the gate and the trio of Big On Charm, Significant Speed
and Exclusive Form dueled for the lead.
</P>
<P>
   Over the final 100 yards, A Delightful Dasher rushed into the
lead and hit the finish line a neck in front of Big On Charm, a
25-to-1 shot. Significant Speed was a neck behind Big On Charm.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's trying to kill me. He's going to put me in a 6-foot
hole,'' said trainer John Bassett of My Delightful Dasher's
appetite for come-from-behind wins. ''This horse does things other
horses can't do.''
</P>
<P>
   Owner Gwendolyn Eaves of Midland, Texas, has gotten used to
seeing the gelding overcome trouble.
</P>
<P>
   ''He just about gives me a heart attack, but that's what makes
him a great horse,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Jockey Joe Badilla, who also rode A Delightful Dasher in last
year's All American Futurity, said the closer the finish line
loomed the better he felt.
</P>
<P>
   ''He broke decent, actually better than he usually does,''
Badilla said. ''But he makes me earn every dollar I've ever made on
him. The three horse (Big On Charm) put a little pressure on me,
but about 30 yards from the wire I sat on him really relaxed
because I knew he was going to win.''
</P>
<P>
   The win was the eighth in 11 races over two years for A
Delightful Dasher. He covered the 440 yards in 21.477 seconds and
paid 44.609, $4.20 and $3 as the favorite. Big On Charm returned
$418.40 and $8.20 and Significant Speed paid $3 to show.
</P>
<P>
   A Delightful Dasher earned $123,172 to boost his career earnings
to $1,639,670.

<HEADLINE> Mariners 5, Red Sox 0  </HEADLINE>
By JIMMY GOLEN
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON (AP) -- Paul Abbott pitched 7 1-3 innings of no-hit ball
on Sunday to rebound from his worst start of the season and lead
the Seattle Mariners to a 5-0 victory over the Boston Red Sox.
</P>
<P>
   A journeyman who has made 10 trips to the disabled list in a
10-year career with six organizations, Abbott (9-5) limited Boston
to three baserunners -- on two walks and an error -- before Rico
Brogna singled up the middle with one out in the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   After Midre Cummings flied out to center, Abbott walked Scott
Hatteberg and Trot Nixon to load the bases and was replaced by Jose
Paniagua. Nomar Garciaparra popped up to right field to end the
inning, then Paniagua retired the Red Sox in order in the ninth to
finish the combined one-hitter and earn his fourth save.
</P>
<P>
   Mark McLemore, who went 3-for-4, and Stan Javier had two doubles
apiece for Seattle, while Alex Rodriguez was 2-for-3 with two walks
and a two-run homer that made it 5-0 in the ninth. The Mariners won
for just the fifth time in their last 20 games, and they won
consecutive games for the first time since Aug. 10-11.
</P>
<P>
   Abbott, who allowed eight runs in seven innings against the New
York Yankees on Monday, had no trouble with the anemic Red Sox, who
managed just three hits in a 4-1 loss on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Tomo Ohka (3-3), who had won three consecutive decisions,
allowed two runs on six hits and four walks in six innings. But the
Red Sox, who are 12th in the AL in runs and batting average,
couldn't hit Abbott.
</P>
<P>
   Javier doubled with one out in the first, Rodriguez walked and,
one out later, John Olerud doubled to score them both. Seattle
added one run off Rod Beck in the seventh when McLemore hit a
leadoff double and scored on Javier's double.
</P>
<P>
   Abbott was drafted by Minnesota in 1985 and debuted in the
majors in 1990. He spent parts of the next three seasons in the
minors before he was signed by the Indians as a minor-league free
agent in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   He spent the next six years in the minors -- much of it on the
disabled list for elbow, shoulder and knee problems. Even the
Mariners, who signed him as a minor-league free agent in 1998,
waived him before re-signing him sending him to Triple-A before
last season.
</P>
<P>
Notes: The Mariners have outscored their opponents 114-83 in the
first inning. They've scored more runs in the first than any other
inning. ... Seattle has never won a season series against Boston.
The Mariners lead the 2000 series 5-4. ... Brian Daubach missed his
fourth consecutive game since injuring his elbow during Tuesday
night's brawl with Tampa Bay. ... Manny Alexander, who started at
third base for the first time since Aug. 28, entered the game in a
4-for-22 slump. ... The Red Sox will retire Carlton Fisk's No. 27
on Monday. ... Boston entered the game 12th in the AL in runs and
batting average.

<HEADLINE> Stunt Pilot Flies Under Bridge  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   KAUNAS, Lithuania (AP) -- With 200,000 spectators cheering him
on, a Lithuanian stunt pilot flew his plane upside down under a low
bridge in the city center.
</P>
<P>
   Jurgis Kairys, 48, turned over his Russian-made SU-26 and flew
under a bridge span Saturday with just 33 feet clearance between
the water and the concrete overhang.
</P>
<P>
   Organizers claimed it was the first time the extremely dangerous
stunt has been performed. Kairys said he didn't think he would do
it again.
</P>
<P>
   ''I do not know if I would repeat the stunt even for a big
reward,'' Kairys said after flying along a river in the center of
the city at speeds approaching 180 mph. Kaunas is 60 miles west of
the capital, Vilnius.
</P>
<P>
   Among the 200,000 people watching from the Nemunas River bank
was Finnish Formula One racer Mika Hakkinen who came to see his
friend fly. ''This is fantastic and thrilling,'' Hakkinen said
after presenting Kairys with a Formula One racer helmet.
</P>
<P>
   Kairys flew under 10 low bridges along a winding river in
Vilnius last year. He has said he wanted to make flying under
bridges a tradition in the ex-Soviet republic.

<HEADLINE> Eagles 41, Cowboys 14  </HEADLINE>
By JAIME ARON
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas (AP) -- There was an onside kickoff to start the
game, frequent blitzes and an endless dose of Duce Staley.
</P>
<P>
   No matter what the Philadelphia Eagles threw at the Dallas
Cowboys, it all worked.
</P>
<P>
   Staley ran for 201 yards and a touchdown and the Eagles' defense
knocked out Troy Aikman in the second quarter, carrying
Philadelphia to a stunningly easy 41-14 victory Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Staley, who also had 62 yards receiving, became the Eagles'
first 200-yard runner since Steve Van Buren in 1949. It was the
first time the Cowboys allowed that many yards to a running back
since 1984 and it was their worst opening-game loss since falling
28-0 in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   The embarrassing debut for coach Dave Campo and his new offense
was made worse by Aikman sustaining the ninth concussion of his
career. He was taken to a hospital for observation.
</P>
<P>
   Also hurt was Dallas' new $42 million receiver, Joey Galloway,
who was carted off the field with a sprained knee with two minutes
left in the game.
</P>
<P>
   In 109-degree heat -- 171 on the artificial turf -- Aikman
misfired all five of his passes and was sacked for 30 yards in
losses on his other four attempts. Three of the sacks came on the
opening series, incredible considering he went down only 19 times
all of last season. The Cowboys did not give up a sack in their
final 94 pass attempts of 1999, when they allowed the second-fewest
sacks in the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   Aikman's only pass that was caught went to Philadelphia
linebacker Jeremiah Trotter. He returned it 27 yards for a
touchdown that put the Eagles up 21-0 early in the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Aikman was KO'd on the next series and Randall Cunningham
replaced him. His first two completions -- which took five
pressure-filled attempts -- went a total of 2 yards and he threw an
interception before getting a first down.
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia's offense started as smooth as its defense thanks
to the 1-2 punch of Staley and quarterback Donovan McNabb.
</P>
<P>
   On the opening kickoff, the Eagles caught Dallas by surprise
with an onside kick. David Akers popped up the kick and Dameane
Douglas caught it at the 42.
</P>
<P>
   Staley had 45 of the 58 yards on that opening drive, which was
capped by a 1-yard touchdown pass to wide-open Jeff Thomason. A
25-yard pass interference penalty set up Staley's 1-yard touchdown
late in the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The teams matched field goals in the middle two quarters with
Philly's David Akers making kicks of 33 and 37 yards and Dallas'
Tim Seder hitting from 34 and 38.
</P>
<P>
   Then it was McNabb's turn again.
</P>
<P>
   He opened the fourth quarter with a 3-yard TD run, then dunked
the ball over the crossbar. His celebration continued with an
airborne chest-bump with Staley that knocked the running back down.
It was the hardest Staley had been hit since flipping over the
Dallas bench in the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The last of Staley's 28 carries was a 60-yarder that set up
Brian Mitchell's 6-yard TD that made it 41-6.
</P>
<P>
   Galloway caught a 4-yard touchdown pass with 6:45 left. A
2-point conversion pass to Raghib Ismail avoided tying the team
record for the worst opening loss.

<HEADLINE> Jets 20, Packers 16  </HEADLINE>
By GREG BEACHAM
<TEXT>
<P>
   GREEN BAY, Wis. (AP) -- The New York Jets stopped Brett Favre
from conjuring any last-minute magic.
</P>
<P>
   Curtis Martin rushed 30 times for 110 yards and a touchdown and
caught a 2-yard TD pass from Vinny Testaverde with 3:30 left as the
Jets beat the Green Bay Packers 20-16 Sunday in the coaching debuts
of Al Groh and Mike Sherman.
</P>
<P>
   But it wasn't over until Favre was denied yet another comeback
win. Victor Green made an acrobatic interception at the Jets 9 with
1:08 to play that robbed Bill Schroeder of a likely touchdown catch
and clinched the victory.
</P>
<P>
   Favre, who led the Packers to three last-minute victories at
Lambeau Field last season -- including the 1999 opener vs. Oakland --
stood at midfield with his hands on his hips after throwing his
only interception of the game.
</P>
<P>
   The Packers lost at home in September for the first time since
Sept. 3, 1995. Green Bay has four losses in its last six games at
Lambeau after winning 44 of the previous 46 home games in Green Bay
and Milwaukee.
</P>
<P>
   Favre, playing for the first time in a month after missing three
preseason games with tendinitis in his throwing elbow, didn't look
physically limited, but was just 14-of-34 for 152 yards. He often
grabbed his arm after throws late in the game.
</P>
<P>
   Like Favre, Testaverde looked rusty and uncertain in the pocket
in his first regular-season action since tearing his Achilles'
tendon in the '99 opener. He overthrew several receivers and was
called for two intentional grounding penalties before finishing
23-of-44 for 261 yards and a TD.
</P>
<P>
   Martin carried the offensive load in the 29th 100-yard rushing
game of his career. He left for one offensive series late in the
first half with a twisted left knee, but returned for the second
half and continued to pound at the Packers.
</P>
<P>
   Martin's work made Groh a winner in his first NFL game as a head
coach. The longtime assistant to Bill Parcells replaced him in
January.
</P>
<P>
   Sherman was with Seattle last year, but previously was an
assistant under Mike Holmgren in Green Bay.
</P>
<P>
   Though the Packers were outgained 379-211 and had possession of
the ball for less than 23 minutes, Green Bay's maligned defense
still frustrated the Jets until the final minutes.
</P>
<P>
   With Mike McKenzie, the Packers' top cornerback, out with a
bruised quadriceps in the second half, the Jets found a weakness to
exploit: McKenzie's backup, Tod McBride.
</P>
<P>
   Dedric Ward blew past McBride on the right sideline to make a
61-yard reception with four minutes to play. Three plays later,
Martin caught a short pass from Testaverde for the deciding points.
</P>
<P>
   The Packers couldn't manage a drive longer than 4:22 or 39 yards
in the game's first three quarters. Their only offensive touchdown
came in the first quarter when Darren Sharper's 29-yard
interception return set up a 4-yard TD pass from Favre to Tyrone
Davis.
</P>
<P>
   Martin capped a 75-yard scoring drive with a 2-yard run late in
the first. The teams could only trade field goals in the second
quarter, and it was 10-10 at the half despite Green Bay managing
just 55 yards on offense.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan Longwell kicked field goals of 45, 42 and 42 yards for the
Packers. John Hall missed field goals of 52 and 48 yards for the
Jets on a windy, overcast day at Lambeau Field.

<HEADLINE> Falcons 36, 49ers 28  </HEADLINE>
By PAUL NEWBERRY
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- The Super Bowl, it wasn't. Still, for a team
desperate to prove last year was an aberration, the Atlanta Falcons
had plenty of reasons for optimism.
</P>
<P>
   Again, Jamal Anderson ran with his knock-'em-down,
drag-'em-along style. Right away, Shawn Jefferson and Ashley
Ambrose paid dividends on a hefty investment. And this time, the
Falcons didn't have to wait until Week 5 for their first victory.
</P>
<P>
   ''Once we got rolling, it was very much approaching what we were
able to do a couple of years ago,'' Chris Chandler said after
Atlanta opened with a 36-28 victory over the San Francisco 49ers on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, the Falcons made it all the way to the Super
Bowl. Anderson isn't making his reservations for Tampa just yet,
knowing this was the 49ers in name only.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've got some work ahead of us before we can run around with
banners,'' said Anderson, who rushed for 77 yards on 24 carries
after tearing up his knee early last season. ''But at least we're
headed in the right direction.''
</P>
<P>
   Jefferson caught seven passes for a career-high 148 yards, while
Ambrose returned an interception 36 yards for a touchdown. Both
were playing their first games for the Falcons, who signed them to
contracts totaling nearly $37 million after starting last season
0-4 and finishing 5-11.
</P>
<P>
   ''We wanted to show them what type of players they picked up,''
Ambrose said.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco still is picking up the pieces after going 4-12,
ending a run of 16 straight winning seasons that included five
Super Bowl titles.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Garcia, taking over formally as successor to the retired
Steve Young, threw for 253 yards and three touchdowns. But he also
underthrew Jerry Rice along the left sideline in the third quarter,
giving Ambrose a chance to step in for the easy touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   ''I really believe we are going to be a good team,'' Garcia
said. ''We know where we have to go from here.''
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta's Morten Andersen tied a career high with five field
goals, all in the first half, and broke Mick Luckhurst's team
record for most career field goals with 119. Andersen has 421
overall.
</P>
<P>
   Jefferson, giving the Falcons a deep threat they didn't have
last year, hauled in a 48-yard touchdown pass from Chris Chandler
just 54 seconds into the second half. It gave Atlanta a 29-14 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Chandler also hooked up with Terance Mathis on a 44-yard
touchdown in the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Ahmed Plummer, a rookie forced to start right away in the 49ers
shaky secondary, was beaten on both of the long touchdown passes.
</P>
<P>
   ''Thank God for tomorrow,'' Plummer said.
</P>
<P>
   Fred Beasley scored three touchdowns for the 49ers. He grabbed a
couple of 4-yard scoring passes and ran it in from the 1.
</P>
<P>
   The 49ers might be a shell of their former greatness, but they
brought back memories of the good ol' days on their first
possession. San Francisco drove 74 yards on eight plays, capped by
Garcia's first TD pass to Beasley.
</P>
<P>
   After falling behind 36-21, the 49ers didn't quit in the fourth
quarter. Garcia drove his team to the Atlanta 4 before getting
sacked by Henri Crockett on fourth down. After Anderson fumbled,
the 49ers made it close on Garcia's 6-yard scoring pass to Terrell
Owens with 2:50 left.
</P>
<P>
   But the Falcons picked up a couple of first downs, including a
13-yard run by Anderson that ran out the clock. The former All-Pro
jogged off the field alone as the final seconds ticked away, as if
to show the Georgia Dome crowd his right knee was fine.
</P>
<P>
   Andersen, who missed his first four kicks last season, hit twice
from 44 yards, another from 43, one from 24 and drilled a 48-yarder
on the final play of the half. Atlanta scored on its first seven
possessions.
</P>
<P>
   ''I felt like as soon as I was off the field, I was right back
on,'' Andersen said. ''I felt like an every-down player.''
</P>
<P>
Notes: San Francisco safety Lance Schulters was knocked out of the
game on the first play from scrimmage in the second half. After
missing a tackle on Anderson, a pile of players rolled into
Schulters' left ankle. X-rays were negative, but he will undergo an
MRI on Monday to determine if the injury is more serious than a
sprain. ... Mathis managed to play after hurting his hip during the
pregame workout. He caught three passes for 72 yards. ... Offensive
lineman Bob Whitfield set an Atlanta record by starting his 113th
consecutive game.

<P>
	   FLORHAM PARK, N.J. (AP) - A Berkeley Heights man has been
charged with murdering his ex-girlfriend and stabbing her boyfriend
after the couple returned from a wedding early Sunday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Vincent P. Conte, 48, has been charged with the murder of
Deborah Schroeder, 45, according to Morris County Prosecutor John
B. Dangler. Conte is also charged with aggravated assault and
possession of a weapon, Dangler said.
</P>

   Schroeder and her boyfriend, Joseph DeMayo, 41, of Harrison,
were attacked in the bedroom of her home at about 2 a.m. with a
knife and baseball bat. Dangler said Conte entered the bedroom and
began stabbing the couple and also hit both in the head with the
bat.
</P>
<P>
   DeMayo ran to a neighbor's house and police were notified. When
police arrived they found Schroeder dead. Conte had self-inflicted
stab wounds, Dangler said. DeMayo was treated for stab wounds to
his forearms and hands and a head injury.
</P>
<P>
   Conte's eight-year relationship with Schroeder had ended
recently, Dangler said.
</P>
<P>
   Bail for Conte was set at $750,000 and he is under police guard
at Morristown Memorial Hospital, Dangler said.

<HEADLINE> S.Korea Leader Works on POW Issue  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- President Kim Dae-jung promised Sunday
to work for the return of hundreds of South Koreans believed held
in North Korea against their will, calling for more talks with the
North on the issue, a state news agency said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have found, through various channels, that there are 700 to
800 such people. We will definitely resolve the issue,'' Kim said
in an interview with the nation's three major TV channels,
according to Yonhap news agency.
</P>
<P>
   ''On the issue, we need more contacts (with North Korean
authorities) to bear fruits,'' Kim said.
</P>
<P>
   South Korea says 454 South Koreans, mostly fishermen, were
abducted by the North. About 300 southern soldiers, captured during
the 1950-53 Korean War, are also believed to be held by the North.
Pyongyang has denied the allegations.
</P>
<P>
   South Korea returned 63 former North Korean spies and guerrillas
on Saturday, many of whom spent decades in southern prisons.
Hundreds of thousands of North Koreans flocked the streets of
Pyongyang to welcome them back as heroes, northern media reported.
</P>
<P>
   The same day in Seoul, eight opposition legislators joined a
rally saying the governement should have demanded the return of
South Koreans held in the North.
</P>
<P>
   The repatriation of the former spies, freed after serving prison
terms ranging from 13 years to 45 years, is part of thawing
relations on the Korean peninsula following a June summit.
</P>
<P>
   After the summit, the first ever between the two states, the two
Koreas reopened a government dialogue and allowed brief reunions of
separated families. The Korean War ended in an armistice, not a
peace treaty, and the two states share the world's most heavily
armed border.
</P>
<P>
   Kim said North Korean leader Kim Jong Il would visit South Korea
in return for his June visit to Pyongyang, but the time of the
visit has not been fixed, Yonhap reported.
</P>
<P>
   Kim also said the North Korean leader agreed that U.S. troops
should stay in the South after the two Koreas reunify. Under a
mutual defense agreement, the Untied States, which fought on the
South Korean side during the Korean War, keeps 37,000 troops in the
South.

<HEADLINE> Pirates 8, Padres 6  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO (AP) -- Jason Kendall hit a two-run homer in the 13th
inning to lift the Pittsburgh Pirates past the San Diego Padres 8-6
Sunday for a sweep of their three-game series.
</P>
<P>
   John Wehner, who joined the Pirates on Friday from Triple-A
Nashville, hit his third single of the day with one out in the
13th. Kendall followed with a shot over the wall in left center off
Carlos Almanzar (3-4) for his 14th homer of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Matt Skrmetta (1-0) went 1 1-3 innings to gain the win in his
first appearance for the Pirates since joining the club Friday from
Triple-A Nashville.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Williams got the final three outs for his 18th save.
</P>
<P>
   Wehner's hit in the 13th was the first by the Pirates since the
sixth inning. There were 16 straight Pittsburgh batters retired
until Abraham Nunez opened the 12th with a walk.
</P>
<P>
   The Pirates' Kris Benson gave up six runs and 13 hits in 6 1-3
innings. He allowed only one hit in eight scoreless innings against
San Francisco in his previous start, when he ended a string of five
straight losses.
</P>
<P>
   San Diego rookie Adam Eaton gave up six runs and six hits in
just three innings, the shortest of his 18 career starts. In his
previous start, Eaton lasted four innings, allowing five runs and
seven hits against the Chicago Cubs.
</P>
<P>
   The Padres trailed 6-4 heading into the seventh inning, but John
Mabry hit a leadoff homer. Mike Darr followed with a walk and Ben
Davis hit a one-out single to put runners at first and third,
chasing Benson. Pinch hitter Phil Nevin then made it 6-6, driving
in the tying run with a forceout off Josias Manzanillo.
</P>
<P>
   The Padres took a 4-1 lead in the second, when they struck for
four runs on six hits. Included were a RBI single by Eaton and a
RBI single by Damian Jackson, who extended his career-high hitting
streak to 12 games.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan Klesko went 3-for-7, including an RBI single.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Ed Sprague rejoined the Padres after his contract was
purchased from Single-A Rancho Cucamonga. San Diego traded Sprague
to Boston on June 30 for two minor league players but the Red Sox
released him on Aug. 13. ... The Padres transferred RHP Stan
Spencer, out since June 20 with a strained right elbow, to the
60-day disabled list from the 15-day list. ... Pittsburgh's Keith
Osik started at catcher -- his third position in four games. He also
started at first base on Thursday and third base on Friday and
Saturday. ... C Ben Davis went 2-for-4 in his first start for the
Padres since he was activated Friday from the 15-day disabled list.
He had been sidelined since Aug. 13 because of a strained oblique
muscle. ... The Pirates recorded their first three-game sweep in
San Diego since 1996.

<HEADLINE> Rain, Cold Slow Pace of Fires  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN KUGLIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   HELENA, Mont. (AP) -- Rain and even snow helped firefighters make
major progress to contain western wildfires Sunday, although a
blaze sparked by lightning forced the evacuation of a national
monument on a busy Labor Day weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Four tour buses and hundreds of tourists were turned away Sunday
from Devils Tower National Monument in northeastern Wyoming because
a 1,550-acre fire was burning about 2&AMP;frac12; miles away, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Devils Tower, a tree-stump shaped tower of exposed volcanic rock
that looms 1,000 feet above wooded terrain and prairie dog towns,
attracts 450,000 visitors annually and is a favorite of climbers.
American Indians consider it sacred.
</P>
<P>
   Firefighters had the blaze about 80 percent contained Sunday
evening as they attempted to overcome 20 mph winds, Crook County
Deputy Fire Warden Gary Gill said.
</P>
<P>
   ''They're kind of kicking us pretty hard right now,'' Gill said.
</P>
<P>
   In Montana, rain and snow made steep terrain slippery and
hazardous for firefighters. Crews stopped digging fire lines at a
20,000-acre blaze on the Flathead Indian Reservation because of the
wet rocks and mud.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was so cold in camp that we had frost,'' Forest Service
spokeswoman Sheela McLean said Sunday at the Bitterroot Valley
fires, which account for half of the state's charred acreage.
</P>
<P>
   The damp conditions, though, helped firefighters make
considerable progress, said Neil Hitchcock of the National
Interagency Fire Center in Boise, Idaho. ''We may have turned the
corner on the fires in Montana and Idaho, but we aren't out of the
woods yet,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The center said that while weather in the West had improved,
hot, dry weather still dominated parts of the Southeast and the
Plains. Several new fires had been reported in Texas, it said.
</P>
<P>
   The agency listed 82 major fires burning Sunday in Arkansas,
California, Idaho, Mississippi, Montana, Nevada, Oklahoma, Oregon,
South Dakota, Texas and Wyoming. They had blackened 1.6 million
acres.
</P>
<P>
   In Montana, 27 large fires were burning on 662,686 acres.
</P>
<P>
   Firefighters expected to fully contain by Wednesday a fire near
Red Lodge, which had forced hundreds of homeowners to evacuate
temporarily last week.
</P>
<P>
   The eight-day-old, 1,500-acre fire wasn't a threat to the town
or mountain homes, ''unless we get a big cold front that comes down
from Alaska with big wind that could kick us back to square one,''
said Forest Service spokesman Jeff Gildehaus.
</P>
<P>
   Rain also helped thousands of firefighters in Idaho, which had
691,665 acres burned or burning. A 22,527-acre fire near Whitebird
was declared contained Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, a firefighter died Sunday in Mississippi of injuries
he had suffered Aug. 20 while fighting a fire in a pine tree
plantation, said state Forestry Commissioner Harold Anderson.
</P>
<P>
   At least eight other firefighters have been killed fighting
wildfires around the nation this year.

Gore: Bush's Debate Offer Too Limited
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- The presidential candidates squabbled over debate
schedules today as Republican George W. Bush announced he had accepted three
prime-time sessions. Democrat Al Gore rejected the plan, saying the formats
proposed by Bush could limit the audience and amount of face-to-face debate
time. Bush proposed debating Gore as soon as next week, or Sept. 12, during a
special edition of NBC's ''Meet the Press;'' Oct. 3 in Los Angeles on CNN's
''Larry King Live;'' and Oct. 17 at Washington University in St. Louis.

Gun Control Advocates Go After Bush
</SUBHEAD>

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Bringing their van tour to Washington, gun control
advocates today assailed GOP presidential candidate George W. Bush, blaming him
for legislation that permits concealed handguns virtually anywhere, including
churches, hospitals and amusement parks. Mike Barnes, president of Handgun
Control, called Bush's record on gun issues ''dangerous'' and said it is matched
by what he called ''absolutely bizarre'' votes against gun control in Congress
by his vice presidential running mate, Dick Cheney.

   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) -- A surge of rebel violence left 35 people dead over
the weekend following President Clinton's visit to Colombia, including seven
police officers slain by guerrillas -- some of whom were disguised as police. In
the latest attack, leftist guerrillas from the Revolutionary Armed Forces of
Colombia, or FARC, sneaked up on a police station Saturday in northern Colombia,
officials said Sunday. The assault took the small town of Tomarrazon by
surprise, said National Police operations director Gen. Tobias Duran.

Congress Firestone Hearings Gain Attention

<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Congress opens hearings this week aimed at determining
when Bridgestone/Firestone Inc. and its customer Ford Motor Co. knew about tire
problems that have been linked to 88 deaths in U.S. accidents and more overseas.
The case was not attracting much attention when lawmakers went on summer break a
month ago, but the resulting media coverage, recall of 6.5 million tires and
government scrutiny in the United States and abroad have made the issue one of
the hottest on Capitol Hill with at least three hearings planned. ''This thing
is just getting uglier by the minute,'' said Ken Johnson, spokesman for Rep.
Billy Tauzin, R-La., who will preside over one of the hearings.

U.S. Group: Sanctions Hurt Iraq Citizens
</SUBHEAD>

   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) -- U.N. economic sanctions against Iraq are missing their
target, hurting not President Saddam Hussein but ordinary civilians, a group of
U.S. activists said Sunday at the end of a six-week experiment in living among
the Iraqi working class. Five members of the Chicago-based group, Voices in the
Wilderness, told a news conference at the Iraqi Trade Ministry that their stay
in a low-income district of the southern city of Basra had shown them that
sanctions crippled the ability of Iraqis to have safe water and food.

Pope Beatifies Controversial Pius IX
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   VATICAN CITY (AP) -- Pope John Paul II advanced two predecessors toward
sainthood Sunday in one of the most disputed such acts of his papacy, beatifying
the 19th century's much-attacked Pius IX alongside the 20th century's
much-beloved John XXIII. Jews bitterly protested John Paul's recognition of
Pius, who over history's longest papacy confined Jews to Rome's ghetto, condoned
the church seizure of a Jewish-born boy and allegedly referred to Jews as
''dogs.'' The Israeli government itself expressed ''deep sorrow,'' especially in
light of the progress John Paul's own 22-year papacy has made in Catholic-Jewish
relations. John Paul acknowledged the rancor, calling Pius ''much loved, but
also hated and slandered.''

<HEADLINE> Indians 12, Orioles 11  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN AFFLECK
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND (AP) -- Kenny Lofton tied a major league for scoring
runs in consecutive games, stole a career-high five bases and hit a
game-winning home run for the Cleveland Indians on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Can you tell his left shoulder feels better?
</P>
<P>
   Lofton's solo homer in the 13th inning gave the Indians a 12-11
win over the Baltimore Orioles.
</P>
<P>
   It also gave Lofton his fourth run of the day after he had
already tied a major league record by scoring in his 18th straight
game. Red Rolfe set the run-scoring streak record in 1939 for the
New York Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   Lofton's day was even more remarkable considering that when
spring training began, the Indians weren't sure the center fielder
would return from a shoulder injury until the All-Star break.
</P>
<P>
   Lofton dislocated his left shoulder sliding headfirst into first
base during the AL playoffs against Boston last year and had
surgery in the offseason.
</P>
<P>
   He returned for opening day -- a recovery considered a medical
miracle by the Indians -- but hasn't been feeling himself until
lately. Since Aug. 8, he's gone 38-of-102.
</P>
<P>
   ''The shoulder's a big part of it,'' Lofton said. ''I'm feeling
a little bit more confident with my arm. It doesn't hurt as much as
it used to.''
</P>
<P>
   Lofton singled and stole second base the first three times he
came to bat and wound up scoring each time. He tied a club record
for stolen bases in a game set twice by Alex Cole on May 3, 1992,
and Aug. 1, 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Trombley (4-5), who pitched 3 1-3 innings, gave up Lofton's
13th homer, a shot into the right-field bullpen with one out in the
13th.
</P>
<P>
   Cameron Cairncross (1-0) got two outs for his first career win
in his sixth appearance. Cairncross said when he saw Lofton's homer
land in the bullpen, ''I didn't know what to do -- jump, cry, sit
down, stand up. It was magic, man.''
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland's victory, combined with Boston's 5-0 loss to Seattle
and Oakland's 8-0 win over Toronto, put the Indians two games ahead
of the Red Sox and the Athletics in the wild card race.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Richard drove in six runs and hit two homers for
Baltimore. His two-run shot to right-center field off reliever Paul
Shuey tied the game at 11 in the seventh inning, capping a four-run
rally which began with two outs.
</P>
<P>
   Albert Belle reached on what seemed like a playable ball to
Travis Fryman, then moved to third on Jeff Conine's double. Cal
Ripken, playing in his second game since coming off the disabled
list with back problems, doubled to left field to cut the Indians'
lead to 11-9. Richard followed with his seventh homer.
</P>
<P>
   Richard earlier hit a three-run homer and Brook Fordyce followed
with a solo shot in Baltimore's five-run fourth inning.
</P>
<P>
   ''For seven innings there were 22 runs scored and all of a
sudden for the next six nobody could get a sniff,'' Orioles manager
Mike Hargrove said.
</P>
<P>
   It was fitting that Lofton finally hit the game-winner after
more than five hours of baseball. He seemed to be on base all day.
</P>
<P>
   ''Kenny was superhuman,'' teammate Sandy Alomar said.
</P>
<P>
   Lofton triggered Cleveland's four-run third by leading off the
inning with a single off Orioles starter Jay Spurgeon. Lofton stole
second and third and scored on Fordyce's throwing error.
</P>
<P>
   In the fourth inning, Lofton bunted his way on after Alomar
reached second on a grounder that went through second baseman Jerry
Hairston's legs and into the outfield for a two-base error. After
Lofton stole second, Omar Vizquel hit a two-run single.
</P>
<P>
   Roberto Alomar's single moved Vizquel to third. Baltimore
reliever Jason Johnson hit Manny Ramirez to load the bases and then
Jim Thome was hit by a pitch to send Vizquel home and give
Cleveland an 8-7 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Thome, who had a season-high five RBIs, hit a two-run double to
highlight a three-run sixth that put Cleveland ahead 11-7.
</P>
<P>
   Lofton singled in the first inning, stole second base and
eventually scored on Thome's single to right field.
</P>
<P>
   Baltimore answered with two runs in the second inning. Belle
walked to lead off the inning and scored on Richard's triple.
Fordyce doubled down the third-base line to drive home Richard.
</P>
<P>
   But in the end, it was Lofton's day -- not Richard's.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't make any excuses, but I couldn't really finish my
swing a lot of times because of the pain in my shoulder,'' Lofton
said. ''Now I can finish my swing and it feels good.''
</P>
<P>
Notes: Ripken went 2-for-4 with two doubles and two RBIs. It was
his second appearance since June 28, when his back problems flared
up again. Ripken also played Friday, when he went 1-for-3. ... The
Orioles had two errors, bringing their season total to 103, the
team's most since 119 in 1988. ... Sandy Alomar left the game after
the seventh inning with leg cramps. He said later that he's fine.
... Cleveland pitcher Bartolo Colon, who left Saturday's game with
tightness in his shoulder, had an MRI on Sunday. The team said his
shoulder is inflamed and a decision will be made by Tuesday on his
next start ... Ramirez singled in the 10th, extending his 18-game
hitting streak.

<HEADLINE> Kean Wins Rail Classic  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SPRINGFIELD, Ill. (AP) -- Laurel Kean completed a remarkable run
from driving range pro to LPGA Tour winner Sunday, shooting her
third straight 6-under-par 66 for a six-stroke victory in the State
Farm Rail Classic.
</P>
<P>
   Kean, 37, a regular on the tour from 1988 to 1998, left
competitive golf early last season and ended up giving lessons at a
Cleveland-area driving range.
</P>
<P>
   ''I lost faith in myself,'' Kean said. ''If I've got anybody to
thank, I should thank my family and a good friend of mine in
Cleveland who got me back motivated to play again. It was hard to
get that confidence back.''
</P>
<P>
   She played her way into the tournament Monday, winning a
two-hole playoff with Caroline Gowan for the final spot in the
field.
</P>
<P>
   ''I almost thought I would get in anyway as the fifth
alternate,'' Kean said. ''So I knew I had that cushion. I just
walked out there and felt comfortable. As far as after that, I
didn't really think about the total picture. I just took it day to
day.''
</P>
<P>
   She earned $135,000 for her first LPGA Tour title after making
only $6,600 in combined earnings on the LPGA Tour and Futures Tour.
</P>
<P>
   ''No wonder my Visa bill is so high,'' Kean said.
</P>
<P>
   She also wrapped up a full exemption for 2001, but is not exempt
for the rest of this year.
</P>
<P>
   Kean chipped in from 30 feet for birdie on the par-4 10th hole,
and finished with seven birdies and a bogey.
</P>
<P>
   ''I just wanted to have a really good day, a good showing,'' she
said. ''If I didn't make birdie early on, I didn't want to rush it
and force anything.
</P>
<P>
   ''I knew I was going to be nervous. Players told me I would be,
but they said don't fight it. Just go with it. My mind was going
100 mph, so I tried just to let it go. I was six holes ahead of
myself, but when I got down to my shot, I took a deep breath and
thought slow.''
</P>
<P>
   South Korea's Mi Hyun Kim, the 1999 winner, shot a 68 to tie for
second with Dina Ammaccapane (69) at 204. Pat Hurst (67) was
another stroke back at 205.
</P>
<P>
   Australian star Karrie Webb, the tour leader with six victories
this year, closed with a 72 to finish 13 strokes back at 211.

the last at-bat this season. They are 17-15 in those games.
</P>
<P>
   CLEVELAND: The Indians said they would decide by Tuesday whether
Bartolo Colon will make his next start on Thursday against Tampa
Bay. The Cleveland ace left Saturday's game with tightness in his
shoulder and had an MRI on Sunday. It showed Colon has inflammation
causing what the team called ''an impingement'' in the shoulder.
... C Sandy Alomar left the game after the seventh inning with leg
cramps. He said later that he's fine, although the Indians listed
him as day-to-day. ... Manny Ramirez singled in the 10th, extending

runs.

those outings. ... Derek Jeter has reached base by a hit or walk in
28 straight games. ... David Justice needs to drive in one more run
for his third 100-RBI season. He had his chances Sunday, grounding

with two on to finish the eighth.
Mariners-Red Sox:
</P>
<P>
   SEATTLE: The Mariners have outscored their opponents 114-83 in

other inning. ... Seattle is 5-4 against Boston and can win its
first season series ever against the Red Sox with a win Monday.
</P>
<P>
   BOSTON: Brian Daubach missed his fourth consecutive game since
injuring his elbow during Tuesday's brawl with Tampa Bay. ... Manny

</P>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY: Manager Tony Muser said OF Carlos Beltran (right
knee bone bruise) and LHP Paul Spoljaric (strained lower back), who
have been rehabbing with Triple-a Omaha, should rejoin the Royals
by Tuesday. ... C Gregg Zaun, who left Saturday's game with a
bruised left thumb, was given the day off. He is day to day. ... 2B
Carlos Febles made his first start since going on the DL Aug. 14
with a sprained right ankle. ... OF Johnny Damon, who leads the AL
with 39 stolen bases, was thrown out trying to steal second in the
first inning by John Flaherty. It was just the eighth time Damon
has been caught stealing this season. He did steal second in the
fifth.
</P>
<P>
   TAMPA BAY: 3B Vinny Castilla (lower back inflammation) should be
activated from the 15-day disabled list in the next couple days.
... RHP Esteban Yan (shoulder fatigue) will not be available for at
least the next couple days. Tampa Bay will likely turn to its minor
league system for some pitching depth. ''We're going to look at,''
manager Larry Rothschild said. ''I need pitching and I think we'll
get some. Probably just for the bullpen, but I'm not sure right
now.'' ... The Devil Rays make their only trip to Jacobs Field this
season starting Monday for a four-games series against Cleveland.
The Indians won 5 of 6 at Tampa Bay, scoring 52 runs in 54 innings.
... The Devil Rays have played 10 straight games in under three
hours.
Angels-White Sox:
</P>
<P>
   CHICAGO: DH Frank Thomas drew his 100th walk of the season. This

runs scored. It's the third most in baseball history behind Babe
Ruth (12 seasons) and Lou Gehrig (11). ... RHP Jon Garland was

drive. ... RHP James Baldwin posted his fifth no-decision in his
last eight starts.
</P>
<P>
   ANAHEIM: The Angels are undecided about Thursday's starter and
will wait to see how LHP Kent Mercker feels. He had to leave
Saturday's game with a strained left shoulder and his status is day
to day. One candidate is Tim Belcher, who has been sidelined since
July 3 with a strained right forearm. ... Scott Spiezio made his
first career start in the OF, starting in left, and fourth career
appearance in the outfielder. Darrin Erstad, the regular LF,
started as the DH for the ninth consecutive game. Erstad is

1998, against Toronto.

Mets-Cardinals:
</P>
<P>

Friday night for No. 2 on the list. ... Al Leiter, who starts
Monday at Cincinnati, left his last outing after three innings
because of a strained right gluteus muscle. He gave up four runs.
Leiter, who threw on the side Saturday, said: ''It's not 100
percent but it's better.'' ... Valentine said John Franco, out with
a strained pectoral muscle, could be available Monday or Tuesday.
... Jay Payton is 4-for-26 against Cardinals pitching, but has a
homer and five RBIs. ... Mike Piazza has been playing with several
nagging injuries lately. He hit a foul tip off his left big toe on
Tuesday and hyperextended his left knee running to first on an
infield hit Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS: Manager Tony La Russa said it might be at least a few
more days before the team activates Mark McGwire, who has been on
the DL since July 7. McGwire did some light jogging before Sunday's
game. ... The Cardinals topped 3.3 million in ticket sales on
Sunday. They lead the NL in home attendance and have played in
front of more than 5.1 million fans home and road. ... Rick Ankiel
matched his season high with a seven-inning outing Sunday. Ankiel
has gone seven innings on six occasions, once each month of the
season. ... J.D. Drew started the last two games against
left-handed pitchers. He's played sparingly against lefties most of
the year, platooning in right field with Eric Davis. ... Ray
Lankford, batting .147 against lefties, was out of the lineup for
the second straight day. He struck out as a pinch hitter in the
ninth and is 1-for-11 as a pinch hitter. ... The Cardinals will

(.313) has missed the past seven games with a dislocated middle
finger on his left hand.
Braves-Astros:
</P>
<P>

games. ... In losing the series 2-1, Atlanta has dropped six of its
last 10 series. ... Andruw Jones is two short of his career high of
90 RBI set in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   HOUSTON: Mitch Meluskey's 14 homers are the most by an Astros
catcher since Craig Biggio's 13 in 1989. ... The Astros are 1-68
when trailing after the eighth inning, worst in the majors.
Brewers-Rockies:
</P>

10-8 in extra innings.
</P>

   COLORADO: Todd Helton's pursuit of .400 took a big hit in the
Milwaukee series as he went 2-for-11 to drop his average to .390.
With four at-bats in each of Colorado's final 26 games, Helton
would have to hit .452 (47-for-104) to reach .400. Silver lining?
Helton has led the NL in hitting for 100 straight days and is
virtually a lock to win the batting title. ... The Rockies have
used a team-record 48 players this season. The previous high was 46
in their inaugural 1993 season. ... Elvis Pena stole his first
career base. He had 48 steals in 61 attempts at Double-A Carolina.
Cubs-Giants:
</P>
<P>

Glenallen Hill to the Yankees. The 25-year-old relief pitcher was
1-0 with a 4.91 ERA in 11 games for Iowa. ... 2B Eric Young, who is
second in the NL with 44 stolen bases, was scratched from the
starting lineup, but manager Don Baylor said it was only to give
him a day off. Young is 14-for-35 (.400) over his last eight games,
and was 4-for-8 with two doubles in the first two games of the
series with the Giants. ... The Cubs have allowed 192 homers,
putting them on pace to break last year's team record of 221
allowed.
</P>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO: RHP John Johnstone, activated from the DL
Saturday, will be brought back slowly, manager Dusty Baker said.
''We want to get his confidence up and get him feeling comfortable
again,'' Baker said. ''It's like starting all over again after
spring training for him.'' ... C Scott Servais is a valuable
addition to the Giants stretch run because ''he knows the staff and
they know him,'' said Baker. Servais played in 69 games with the
Giants last season before signing with Colorado during the
offseason. ''He gives me a veteran who knows the league, and he
pays attention big time,'' Baker said. ''He knows what's going on
in the game.''
Marlins-Diamondbacks:
</P>
<P>
   FLORIDA: Mike Lowell extended his career-high hitting streak to
14 games with an RBI single in the first inning. ... Preston Wilson
set a career mark by hitting safely in six consecutive at-bats,
including his first three in this game. Wilson was 3-for-5 Saturday
and reached 100 RBIs. ''That's pretty significant stuff for a
second-year player,'' manager John Boles said about Wilson, a
runnerup for the 1999 NL Rookie of the Year Award. ''There aren't
many second-year players who hit that century mark.'' ... A.J.
Burnett worked into the seventh inning for the eighth time in 16
career starts, but allowed a career-high 12 hits in his 6 1-3
innings.
</P>
<P>
   ARIZONA: 1B Greg Colbrunn had his sixth consecutive multihit
game, going 2-for-5. ... Starter Todd Stottlemyre, who battled
through a rotator cuff tear last season without surgery, is on a
100-pitch count, exceeding that just once this year -- 101 pitches
on May 24 in a win over Pittsburgh. In his first action since
developing elbow tendinitis June 26, he threw 89 pitches in 4 2-3
innings Sunday. ... Randy Johnson will face Atlanta's Greg Maddux
on Tuesday in a showdown of contenders for the NL Cy Young Award
which Johnson won last year.
Phillies-Dodgers:
</P>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA: Despite having scored the fewest runs in the
majors, the Phillies have been shut out only four times this season
-- including Saturday night's 10-inning, 1-0 loss to the Dodgers.
... Hitting coach Hal McRae has had a frustrating time getting his
philosophy across to the players. The Phillies have the fewest home
runs, second-fewest hits and the second-lowest team average in the
NL. ... Since becoming the Phillies' leadoff hitter on Aug. 20,
Bobby Abreu has gone 20-for-52 with 11 walks. Philadelphia won six
of those first nine games, but lost four in a row heading into
Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES: Manager Davey Johnson is convinced that Kevin Brown
(12-5) could have been a 20-game winner this season with any kind
of run support. The right-hander, whose only 20-win season was in
1992 with Texas, has a loss and six no-decisions in the 12 games in
which he has allowed no more than one earned run. ''He's pitched
great for us the last couple of years, but we just haven't scored a
lot of runs for him,'' Johnson said. ''That's generally what
happens when you go against the other team's number one starter.''
... RHP Chan Ho Park, who allowed only three earned runs over 24
innings during the three-game winning streak he took into Sunday
night's game, can point to an adjustment in his attitude during
bullpen sessions for his recent streak -- rather than his mechanics
in games. ''It's been more of a confidence factor and change in his
work ethic,'' said pitching coach Claude Osteen, who sat down with
Park and Dodgers team psychologist Ken Ravizza after a particularly
ugly outing on July 4 at San Diego. ''He's been taking his bullpen
practices more seriously, working on his pitches and not just
throwing. He's executing his pitches now, and they're not cutting
on him anymore like they used to.''
Pirates-Padres:
</P>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH: Pittsburgh's Keith Osik started at catcher for his
third position in four games. He also started at first base on
Thursday and third base on Friday and Saturday. ... The Pirates
earned their first three-game sweep in San Diego since 1996.
</P>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO: INF Ed Sprague rejoined the Padres after his contract
was purchased from Class-A Rancho Cucamonga. San Diego traded
Sprague to Boston on June 30 for two minor league players but the
Red Sox released him on Aug. 13. ... The Padres transferred RHP
Stan Spencer, out since June 20 with a strained right elbow, to the
60-day DL from the 15-day list. ... C Ben Davis made his first
start for the Padres since he was activated Friday from the 15-day
DL. He had been sidelined since Aug. 13 because of a strained
oblique muscle.

on May 24 in a win over Pittsburgh. In his first action since
developing elbow tendinitis June 26, he threw 89 pitches in 4 2-3
innings Sunday. ... Randy Johnson will face Atlanta's Greg Maddux
on Tuesday in a showdown of contenders for the NL Cy Young Award
which Johnson won last year.
Phillies-Dodgers:
</P>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA: Despite having scored the fewest runs in the
majors, the Phillies have been shut out only four times this season
-- including Saturday night's 10-inning, 1-0 loss to the Dodgers.
... Hitting coach Hal McRae has had a frustrating time getting his
philosophy across to the players. The Phillies have the fewest home
runs, second-fewest hits and the second-lowest team average in the
NL. ... Since becoming the Phillies' leadoff hitter on Aug. 20,
Bobby Abreu has gone 20-for-52 with 11 walks. Philadelphia won six
of those first nine games, but lost four in a row heading into
Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES: Manager Davey Johnson is convinced that Kevin Brown
(12-5) could have been a 20-game winner this season with any kind
of run support. The right-hander, whose only 20-win season was in
1992 with Texas, has a loss and six no-decisions in the 12 games in
which he has allowed no more than one earned run. ''He's pitched
great for us the last couple of years, but we just haven't scored a
lot of runs for him,'' Johnson said. ''That's generally what
happens when you go against the other team's number one starter.''
... RHP Chan Ho Park, who allowed only three earned runs over 24
innings during the three-game winning streak he took into Sunday
night's game, can point to an adjustment in his attitude during
bullpen sessions for his recent streak -- rather than his mechanics
in games. ''It's been more of a confidence factor and change in his
work ethic,'' said pitching coach Claude Osteen, who sat down with
Park and Dodgers team psychologist Ken Ravizza after a particularly
ugly outing on July 4 at San Diego. ''He's been taking his bullpen
practices more seriously, working on his pitches and not just
throwing. He's executing his pitches now, and they're not cutting
on him anymore like they used to.''
Pirates-Padres:
</P>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH: Pittsburgh's Keith Osik started at catcher for his
third position in four games. He also started at first base on
Thursday and third base on Friday and Saturday. ... The Pirates
earned their first three-game sweep in San Diego since 1996.
</P>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO: INF Ed Sprague rejoined the Padres after his contract
was purchased from Class-A Rancho Cucamonga. San Diego traded
Sprague to Boston on June 30 for two minor league players but the
Red Sox released him on Aug. 13. ... The Padres transferred RHP
Stan Spencer, out since June 20 with a strained right elbow, to the
60-day DL from the 15-day list. ... C Ben Davis made his first
start for the Padres since he was activated Friday from the 15-day
DL. He had been sidelined since Aug. 13 because of a strained
oblique muscle.

<HEADLINE> Notes From Sunday's Games  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated PressAMERICAN LEAGUE:
Athletics-Blue Jays:
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND: SS Miguel Tejada hit his 23rd homer, a new Oakland
record for shortstops. ... The A's have won eight of nine games at
SkyDome. ... Oakland has hit 13 home runs in its last nine games.
... The A's lead the majors with 123 errors, surpassing their total
for all of last season. ... Starter Tim Hudson is 26-8 in his
career.
</P>
<P>
   TORONTO: Toronto starters are 7-3 with a 3.12 ERA in their last
13 games. ... OF Dave Martinez is hitting .404 (38-for-94) in 23
games since being acquired from Texas on Aug. 5. ... The Blue Jays
have gone three consecutive games without a homer for just the
second time this season.
Rangers-Tigers:
</P>
<P>
   TEXAS: The Rangers lost two out of three in Detroit and have
dropped their last nine series. ... The teams split their season
series 5-5. ... Texas is 8-13 at Detroit the past five seasons. ...
Ryan Glynn won for the first time in two starts since coming off
the DL because of a fainting spell Aug. 11.
</P>
<P>
   DETROIT: Deivi Cruz's double in the fourth inning was his 41st
of the season. He's the first Tiger to top 40 doubles since Lance
Parrish had 42 in 1983. ... Jeff Weaver fell to 0-3 for his career
against the Rangers.
Orioles-Indians:
</P>
<P>
   BALTIMORE: Despite Sunday's loss, the Orioles won the season
series with the Indians 5-4. ... Cal Ripken played in two games
against Cleveland this weekend -- on Friday and Sunday -- and
finished 3-of-7. He had been on the disabled list June 28 with back
problems. ''I feel pretty good,'' he said. ''I felt like I hadn't
missed two months.'' ... The Orioles have had 32 games decided in
the last at-bat this season. They are 17-15 in those games.
</P>
<P>
   CLEVELAND: The Indians said they would decide by Tuesday whether
Bartolo Colon will make his next start on Thursday against Tampa
Bay. The Cleveland ace left Saturday's game with tightness in his
shoulder and had an MRI on Sunday. It showed Colon has inflammation
causing what the team called ''an impingement'' in the shoulder.
... C Sandy Alomar left the game after the seventh inning with leg
cramps. He said later that he's fine, although the Indians listed
him as day-to-day. ... Manny Ramirez singled in the 10th, extending
his 18-hit hitting streak. ... Sunday's game was the longest of the
season for the Indians -- it took 5 hours, 17 minutes to play.
Twins-Yankees:
</P>
<P>
   MINNESOTA: Ron Coomer was only 4-for-24 lifetime against Roger
Clemens before hitting a tying home run off him Sunday. ... The
Twins split 10 games with New York this year. It's the first time
since 1992 that Minnesota has not lost the season series. ... In
those 10 matchups this year, the Twins and Yankees each scored 45
runs.
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK: Roger Clemens is 7-0 in his last 13 starts with a 2.47
ERA in that span. He has pitched at least six innings in each of
those outings. ... Derek Jeter has reached base by a hit or walk in
28 straight games. ... David Justice needs to drive in one more run
for his third 100-RBI season. He had his chances Sunday, grounding
out with the bases loaded to end the third inning and striking out
with two on to finish the eighth.
Mariners-Red Sox:
</P>
<P>
   SEATTLE: The Mariners have outscored their opponents 114-83 in
the first inning. They've scored more runs in the first than any
other inning. ... Seattle is 5-4 against Boston and can win its
first season series ever against the Red Sox with a win Monday.
</P>
<P>
   BOSTON: Brian Daubach missed his fourth consecutive game since
injuring his elbow during Tuesday's brawl with Tampa Bay. ... Manny
Alexander, who started at third base for the first time since Aug.
28, entered the game in a 4-for-22 slump. ... The Red Sox will
retire Carlton Fisk's No. 27 on Monday.
Royals-Devil Rays:
</P>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY: Manager Tony Muser said OF Carlos Beltran (right
knee bone bruise) and LHP Paul Spoljaric (strained lower back), who
have been rehabbing with Triple-a Omaha, should rejoin the Royals
by Tuesday. ... C Gregg Zaun, who left Saturday's game with a
bruised left thumb, was given the day off. He is day to day. ... 2B
Carlos Febles made his first start since going on the DL Aug. 14
with a sprained right ankle. ... OF Johnny Damon, who leads the AL
with 39 stolen bases, was thrown out trying to steal second in the
first inning by John Flaherty. It was just the eighth time Damon
has been caught stealing this season. He did steal second in the
fifth.
</P>
<P>
   TAMPA BAY: 3B Vinny Castilla (lower back inflammation) should be
activated from the 15-day disabled list in the next couple days.
... RHP Esteban Yan (shoulder fatigue) will not be available for at
least the next couple days. Tampa Bay will likely turn to its minor
league system for some pitching depth. ''We're going to look at,''
manager Larry Rothschild said. ''I need pitching and I think we'll
get some. Probably just for the bullpen, but I'm not sure right
now.'' ... The Devil Rays make their only trip to Jacobs Field this
season starting Monday for a four-games series against Cleveland.
The Indians won 5 of 6 at Tampa Bay, scoring 52 runs in 54 innings.
... The Devil Rays have played 10 straight games in under three
hours.
Angels-White Sox:
</P>
<P>
   CHICAGO: DH Frank Thomas drew his 100th walk of the season. This
marks the ninth time Thomas has totaled 100 RBI, 100 walks and 100
runs scored. It's the third most in baseball history behind Babe
Ruth (12 seasons) and Lou Gehrig (11). ... RHP Jon Garland was
reinstated from the DL and will make his first start since Aug. 18
on Monday. In nine starts, the rookie was 3-4 with a 5.98 ERA. He
had been sidelined after being hit on the right forearm by a line
drive. ... RHP James Baldwin posted his fifth no-decision in his
last eight starts.
</P>
<P>
   ANAHEIM: The Angels are undecided about Thursday's starter and
will wait to see how LHP Kent Mercker feels. He had to leave
Saturday's game with a strained left shoulder and his status is day
to day. One candidate is Tim Belcher, who has been sidelined since
July 3 with a strained right forearm. ... Scott Spiezio made his
first career start in the OF, starting in left, and fourth career
appearance in the outfielder. Darrin Erstad, the regular LF,
started as the DH for the ninth consecutive game. Erstad is
bothered by a rib injury. ... Spiezio matched his career high with
four RBIs, the seventh time he has done so and first since Aug. 18,
1998, against Toronto.
NATIONAL LEAGUE:
Mets-Cardinals:
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK: Bobby Valentine has managed 1,840 games without
finishing in first place. Only Jimmy Dykes (2,962) has managed more
games without coming in first. Valentine passed Paul Richards
Friday night for No. 2 on the list. ... Al Leiter, who starts
Monday at Cincinnati, left his last outing after three innings
because of a strained right gluteus muscle. He gave up four runs.
Leiter, who threw on the side Saturday, said: ''It's not 100
percent but it's better.'' ... Valentine said John Franco, out with
a strained pectoral muscle, could be available Monday or Tuesday.
... Jay Payton is 4-for-26 against Cardinals pitching, but has a
homer and five RBIs. ... Mike Piazza has been playing with several
nagging injuries lately. He hit a foul tip off his left big toe on
Tuesday and hyperextended his left knee running to first on an
infield hit Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS: Manager Tony La Russa said it might be at least a few
more days before the team activates Mark McGwire, who has been on
the DL since July 7. McGwire did some light jogging before Sunday's
game. ... The Cardinals topped 3.3 million in ticket sales on
Sunday. They lead the NL in home attendance and have played in
front of more than 5.1 million fans home and road. ... Rick Ankiel
matched his season high with a seven-inning outing Sunday. Ankiel
has gone seven innings on six occasions, once each month of the
season. ... J.D. Drew started the last two games against
left-handed pitchers. He's played sparingly against lefties most of
the year, platooning in right field with Eric Davis. ... Ray
Lankford, batting .147 against lefties, was out of the lineup for
the second straight day. He struck out as a pinch hitter in the
ninth and is 1-for-11 as a pinch hitter. ... The Cardinals will
call up outfielder Luis Saturria from Double-A Arkansas on Monday.
Expos-Reds:
</P>
<P>
   MONTREAL: The Expos plan to expand their roster to 30 players on
Tuesday by calling up from Ottawa RHP Guillermo Mota and Jeremy
Powell, LHP Sean Spencer and IF Thomas De La Rosa.
</P>
<P>
   CINCINNATI: Ken Griffey Jr. sat out Sunday's game, only the
third he has missed this year, with a sore hip. ... Barry Larkin
(.313) has missed the past seven games with a dislocated middle
finger on his left hand.
Braves-Astros:
</P>
<P>
   ATLANTA: Rafael Furcal has at least one walk in seven straight
games. ... In losing the series 2-1, Atlanta has dropped six of its
last 10 series. ... Andruw Jones is two short of his career high of
90 RBI set in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   HOUSTON: Mitch Meluskey's 14 homers are the most by an Astros
catcher since Craig Biggio's 13 in 1989. ... The Astros are 1-68
when trailing after the eighth inning, worst in the majors.
Brewers-Rockies:
</P>
<P>
   MILWAUKEE: SS Jose Hernandez, who came off the DL on Thursday,
was scratched from the lineup because of tightness in his back. His
replacement, Luis Lopez, committed two throwing errors but went
4-for-5 with a homer. ... LHP Ray King pitched a scoreless seventh
and has not allowed a run in his last 13 relief appearances
spanning 12 2-3 innings. ... 1B Richie Sexson failed to drive in a
run for the first time in five games. ... Milwaukee improved to
10-8 in extra innings.
</P>
<P>
   COLORADO: Todd Helton's pursuit of .400 took a big hit in the
Milwaukee series as he went 2-for-11 to drop his average to .390.
With four at-bats in each of Colorado's final 26 games, Helton
would have to hit .452 (47-for-104) to reach .400. Silver lining?
Helton has led the NL in hitting for 100 straight days and is
virtually a lock to win the batting title. ... The Rockies have
used a team-record 48 players this season. The previous high was 46
in their inaugural 1993 season. ... Elvis Pena stole his first
career base. He had 48 steals in 61 attempts at Double-A Carolina.
Cubs-Giants:
</P>
<P>
   CHICAGO: The Cubs purchased the contract of LHP Ozwaldo Mairena
from Triple-A Iowa. Mairena was acquired in the trade that sent OF
Glenallen Hill to the Yankees. The 25-year-old relief pitcher was
1-0 with a 4.91 ERA in 11 games for Iowa. ... 2B Eric Young, who is
second in the NL with 44 stolen bases, was scratched from the
starting lineup, but manager Don Baylor said it was only to give
him a day off. Young is 14-for-35 (.400) over his last eight games,
and was 4-for-8 with two doubles in the first two games of the
series with the Giants. ... The Cubs have allowed 192 homers,
putting them on pace to break last year's team record of 221
allowed.
</P>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO: RHP John Johnstone, activated from the DL
Saturday, will be brought back slowly, manager Dusty Baker said.
''We want to get his confidence up and get him feeling comfortable
again,'' Baker said. ''It's like starting all over again after
spring training for him.'' ... C Scott Servais is a valuable
addition to the Giants stretch run because ''he knows the staff and
they know him,'' said Baker. Servais played in 69 games with the
Giants last season before signing with Colorado during the
offseason. ''He gives me a veteran who knows the league, and he
pays attention big time,'' Baker said. ''He knows what's going on
in the game.''
Marlins-Diamondbacks:
</P>
<P>
   FLORIDA: Mike Lowell extended his career-high hitting streak to
14 games with an RBI single in the first inning. ... Preston Wilson
set a career mark by hitting safely in six consecutive at-bats,
including his first three in this game. Wilson was 3-for-5 Saturday
and reached 100 RBIs. ''That's pretty significant stuff for a
second-year player,'' manager John Boles said about Wilson, a
runnerup for the 1999 NL Rookie of the Year Award. ''There aren't
many second-year players who hit that century mark.'' ... A.J.
Burnett worked into the seventh inning for the eighth time in 16
career starts, but allowed a career-high 12 hits in his 6 1-3
innings.
</P>
<P>
   ARIZONA: 1B Greg Colbrunn had his sixth consecutive multihit
game, going 2-for-5. ... Starter Todd Stottlemyre, who battled
through a rotator cuff tear last season without surgery, is on a
100-pitch count, exceeding that just once this year -- 101 pitches
on May 24 in a win over Pittsburgh. In his first action since
developing elbow tendinitis June 26, he threw 89 pitches in 4 2-3
innings Sunday. ... Randy Johnson will face Atlanta's Greg Maddux
on Tuesday in a showdown of contenders for the NL Cy Young Award
which Johnson won last year.
Phillies-Dodgers:
</P>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA: Despite having scored the fewest runs in the
majors, the Phillies have been shut out only four times this season
-- including Saturday night's 10-inning, 1-0 loss to the Dodgers.
... Hitting coach Hal McRae has had a frustrating time getting his
philosophy across to the players. The Phillies have the fewest home
runs, second-fewest hits and the second-lowest team average in the
NL. ... Since becoming the Phillies' leadoff hitter on Aug. 20,
Bobby Abreu has gone 20-for-52 with 11 walks. Philadelphia won six
of those first nine games, but lost four in a row heading into
Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES: Manager Davey Johnson is convinced that Kevin Brown
(12-5) could have been a 20-game winner this season with any kind
of run support. The right-hander, whose only 20-win season was in
1992 with Texas, has a loss and six no-decisions in the 12 games in

<HEADLINE> Gore Opposing 2 Ore. Measures  </HEADLINE>
By CRISTINE GONZALEZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- Reaching out to union members in a
battleground state, Al Gore is opposing two Oregon ballot measures
that would make it harder for organized labor to lobby and raise
money for political campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   ''What this boils down to is that, once again, Al Gore is
showing that he is standing side-by-side with hard-working families
here and around the country,'' Gore spokesman David Chai said
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president was to appear at a rally in a Portland park
on Monday as part of a Labor Day weekend dash through five states.
</P>
<P>
   Oregon has voted for a Democrat the last three presidential
elections, but the state and its seven electoral votes are up for
grabs between Gore and his Republican rival, Texas Gov. George W.
Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's position on the two Oregon measures isn't ''enough for
him to prevail as a presidential candidate,'' said political
scientist Bill Lunch of Oregon State University. ''But it is part
of a larger strategy that he's been using, and it seems to be
working -- in particular in the Pacific Northwest.''
</P>
<P>
   Measure 92 would prohibit unions from collecting money from
employees for political purposes through payroll deductions without
written permission. Measure 98 -- which prohibits the use of public
resources for political purposes -- would essentially ban unions
from lobbying the state Legislature, Lunch said.

<HEADLINE> Notre Dame Passes First Test  </HEADLINE>
By TOM COYNE
<TEXT>
<P>
   SOUTH BEND, Ind. (AP) -- Notre Dame's defense passed its first
test. A much bigger test awaits this week against top-ranked
Nebraska.
</P>
<P>
   The 23rd-ranked Irish held Texas A&AMP;M to 255 yards, including 24
rushing yards in the second half, in a 24-10 victory Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Notre Dame faces a stiffer challenge against the Cornhuskers,
who opened with a 49-13 victory over San Jose State.
</P>
<P>
   The Cornhuskers' Eric Crouch, who rushed for three touchdowns
and passed for another Saturday, has the attention of Notre Dame
coach Bob Davie.
</P>
<P>
   ''He is extremely fast. He is legitimately fast. I really enjoy
watching him play,'' Davie said. ''I don't think that I'm going to
enjoy playing against him.''
</P>
<P>
   Davie said the Irish need to play better against Nebraska, but
the Texas A&AMP;M victory should help.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a lot more fun to play the No. 1 ranked team in the
country (being) 1-0 rather than 0-1, I promise you that,'' Davie
said.
</P>
<P>
   Notre Dame's defensive performance included holding the Aggies
to a field goal after they had a fourth-and-goal from the 2-yard
line midway through the third quarter, and stopping quarterback
Mark Farris on a keeper on third-and-1.
</P>
<P>
   ''At the beginning of the game, a lot of players had the
jitters. They were still thinking about last year,'' safety Tony
Driver said. ''But we got out there, we made a couple of stops, and
we said, 'We can do this.' After that, the confidence just took
over.''
</P>
<P>
   After the goal-line stand, the Irish held the Aggies to
three-and-out and a total of nine yards on their next three
possessions.
</P>
<P>
   ''It wasn't that we went into the game not being confident. It's
just the fact that we hadn't had a whole lot of success, and when
things start going poorly you're never sure how you're going to
react,'' Davie said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Things started going poorly for the Irish at the start of the
second half. Texas A&AMP;M appeared ready to take control during a
15-play, 74-yard drive that chewed more than seven minutes off the
clock. Aided by two pass interference calls, the Aggies had a
first-and-goal from the 2-yard line.
</P>
<P>
   Irish defensive end Grant Irons tackled Aggies tailback Joe
Weber in the backfield for a 2-yard loss and Texas A&AMP;M settled for
a field goal and a 10-7 lead.
</P>
<P>
   ''Any time you have a chance to get more points it changes how
you see things throughout the game -- the way you see it and the way
they see it,'' A&AMP;M coach R.C. Slocum said. ''We let some
opportunities slip away.''
</P>
<P>
   Notre Dame quarterback Arnaz Battle had a successful debut.
</P>
<P>
   After completing 6 of 11 passes for 54 yards in the first half,
Battle completed 4 of 5 passes in the second half for 79 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Battle threw for one score and Julius Jones rushed for another
to put the Irish ahead to stay.
</P>
<P>
   Battle also carried 12 times for 50 yards. He sprained his ankle
in the second quarter and will likely sit out Monday's practice and
resume action Tuesday, Davie said.

   Sabbatini, 24, a native of South Africa who lives in Tucson,
Ariz., closed with a 6-under-par 65 for a 16-under 268 total. He
earned $540,000 for his first PGA Tour title.
</P>
<P>
   ''I limited the mistakes and kept myself in the game,''
Sabbatini said. ''I kept it solid and kept focusing on what I was
trying to do. I'm just really happy.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's been a year where I've been trying to progress my game
It's starting to go in the right direction. Winning makes me feel
more confident and more relaxed out there.''
</P>
<P>
   New Zealand's Grant Waite, who started the round with a
one-stroke, shot a 69 to finish second. Mark Calcavechia, the 1997
winner, closed with a 67 to finish third at 270.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Riley birdied five straight holes on the back nine for a
68. He tied for fourth at 271 with Spanish star Sergio Garcia (69),
Mike Clark II (63) and Doug Barron (67).
</P>
<P>
   ''Unfortunately I didn't play very well on the front nine,''
said Garcia, who birdied three of his last seven holes.
</P>
<P>
   ''I came back strong on the back nine, hit a lot of good shots
and had a couple of really good putts. I had a good chance.''
</P>
<P>
   Defending champion Mike Weir of Canada closed with a 73 to
finish at 6 under.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm a little disappointed,'' Weir said. ''I thought by the way
I was striking on the range, I'd have some good shots, be 5 or 6
under and give myself a chance. I didn't play very well.''
</P>
<P>
   Sabbatini eagled the fourth hole en route to a front-nine 33 on
the Northview course. He missed the cut in three of the previous
five tournaments.
</P>
<P>
   Clark made a 25-foot birdie putt on No. 18 for his 63.
</P>
<P>
   ''I started feeling pretty good about my swing and made putts,''
Clark said. ''I started playing attention my line a little bit
better on the ball.''

<HEADLINE> Diamondbacks 10, Marlins 5  </HEADLINE>
By MEL REISNER
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX (AP) -- Todd Stottlemyre returned for Arizona and things
started to click for the slumping Diamondbacks.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Finley hit a tiebreaking two-run homer in the seventh
inning as the Diamondbacks snapped their five-game home losing
streak with a 10-5 victory over the Florida Marlins on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ''This was a pretty emotional day for all of us,'' said Luis
Gonzalez, who had three hits and scored on Finley's homer. ''We've
scuffled a little bit at time. But we had 'Stott' making his
comeback, late in the game throwing 93 to 95 mph, and that shows
what a competitor he is.''
</P>
<P>
   Stottlemyre gave up eight hits and five runs in 4 2-3 innings in
his return to the Diamondbacks after nearly two months on the
disabled list. He also scored two runs and doubled in his only
at-bat.
</P>
<P>
   ''I felt like a kid again,'' said the 34-year-old right-hander,
who was 8-5 before developing elbow tendinitis in late June. ''I
feel great. My flexibility was great after the game.''
</P>
<P>
   The score was tied 5-5 when Gonzalez led off the seventh with a
single off Florida starter A.J. Burnett (2-4). Burnett got Greg
Colbrunn to fly out but then was lifted to allow left-hander
Armando Almanza to face Finley.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't work, as Finley lined a pitch into the right-field
grandstand for his 34th homer, tying his career high set last
season.
</P>
<P>
   ''Armando deserves better than that,'' Florida manager John
Boles said. ''Finley is one of five people in the world who could
hit that pitch out. The ball almost bounced, and he golfed it.''
</P>
<P>
   Finley agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's got me out with a curveball a lot before,'' Finley said.
''It actually wasn't a bad pitch. I was just making sure I saw the
ball real well, and I was lucky enough to get the good part of the
bat on the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks then loaded the bases with two outs, and Tony
Womack had a two-run single and Jay Bell hit his second RBI single.
</P>
<P>
   Byung-Hyun Kim (4-5) worked one inning for the win, despite
allowing one hit and hitting two batters to help Arizona stay five
games behind first-place San Francisco in the NL West.
</P>
<P>
   Stottlemyre, Arizona's No. 2 starter behind Randy Johnson, had
been on the disabled list since June 26 with tendinitis in his
right elbow. The same ailment kept him on the DL from May 30 to
June 14, and Stottlemyre is planning to have surgery to relocate a
nerve during the offseason.
</P>
<P>
   This is the second consecutive year that Stottlemyre has
rejoined the Diamondbacks late in the season. Last year, he
partially tore his rotator cuff but decided against surgery because
he wanted to stay in the rotation.
</P>
<P>
   Stottlemyre came out after Derrek Lee tied the game at 5 with an
RBI single. Preston Wilson also had an RBI single in the inning,
giving him hits in six consecutive at-bats.
</P>
<P>
   Florida opened a 3-0 lead by scoring once in each of the first
three innings -- on Mike Lowell's RBI single and groundouts by Luis
Castillo and Lowell. But the Diamondbacks cut the deficit to 3-2 in
their third and went ahead with three runs in the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   Stottlemyre started the rally with a one-out double into the gap
in left-center, advanced on a single by Womack and scored on Bell's
sacrifice fly. Gonzalez added an RBI single.
</P>
<P>
   Finley doubled and scored on Danny Bautista triple in the
fourth. Kelly Stinnett and Bell added RBI singles.
</P>
<P>
   ''I had a groove in the first, and then I got out of it,''
Burnett said. ''I was rushing pitches and getting frustrated. When
you get frustrated, you get hit.''
</P>
<P>
Notes: Colbrunn has six consecutive multihit games. ... The
Diamondbacks' five losses at home tied a record set three times in
1998. ... Burnett worked into the seventh inning for the eighth
time in 16 career starts, but gave up a career-high 12 hits. ...
Lowell extended his career-high hitting streak to 14 games.

<HEADLINE> Turnovers Pile Up in Leaf's Return  </HEADLINE>
By BERNIE WILSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) -- It seemed just like old times for Ryan
Leaf. And that's not a good thing.
</P>
<P>
   Leaf showed tenacity in coming back from two injuries in his
first real game for the San Diego Chargers in nearly 21 months, but
another rash of turnovers helped spoil the quarterback's return and
lead to a 9-6 win by the Oakland Raiders on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Leaf was a mess afterward, both physically and on the stat
sheet.
</P>
<P>
   He needed seven or eight stitches to close a gash in his chin,
which came courtesy of a late hit by Raiders end Regan Upshaw in
the first quarter. He had to take IV fluids to combat cramping in
his legs, which forced him to the sideline for one play early in
the fourth quarter, accompanied by boos from Raiders fans. He said
he might have broken his non-throwing left hand; X-rays are planned
for Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Just as painful to the Chargers were Leaf's three interceptions
and two fumbles, one of which he lost. That gives him 23 turnovers
in his short career, compared to just two touchdown passes.
</P>
<P>
   ''I could have done a lot more to help this team win today,''
said Leaf, who had a strong exhibition season to win back the
starting job he'd lost midway through his troubled rookie season of
1998. ''I've just got to take that this week and trudge forward.''
</P>
<P>
   Leaf's first two interceptions were on overthrows, the first one
bouncing off Curtis Conway's hands to Marquez Pope. The next one
sailed past tight end Freddie Jones to nemesis Charles Woodson,
who's been picking on Leaf since his key end zone interception in
the Rose Bowl on Jan. 1, 1998, when Michigan beat Washington State.
</P>
<P>
   Leaf's fumble and his last interception really hurt. With the
Chargers at the Oakland 15 and trailing 2-0 late in the third
quarter, Leaf was hit by Lance Johnstone and the ball popped free.
Leaf reached for the ball, but was trapped under the pile and it
was out of his reach. It was scooped up by Upshaw.
</P>
<P>
   Leaf came back to lead the Chargers on their only scoring drive,
an 80-yard march capped by Robert Chancey's 3-yard run. Leaf missed
one play on the drive with cramps.
</P>
<P>
   The second pick overall in the 1998 draft downplayed his
contribution on that drive.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's the thing, it was just one drive,'' Leaf said.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, with the Chargers needing just inches to convert a
fourth down from their 29 with 1:25 to play, Leaf's pass to Jones
was picked off by linebacker William Thomas.
</P>
<P>
   As Leaf walked off the field, he looked back like he was
surveying a car wreck he'd just been in.
</P>
<P>
   ''If I could have gotten it over the top of the defender, we
probably could have had a 40- to 50- yard gain,'' Leaf said.
''We've got to hold our own, and that starts with me as the
quarterback.''
</P>
<P>
   Leaf completed just 17 of 39 passes for 180 yards. Chargers
receivers dropped several balls and slipped on the turf a few
times.
</P>
<P>
   While complimenting Leaf's toughness, coach Mike Riley said his
performance was erratic.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was like the game -- his play was tough at times. You just
can't win with turnovers,'' Riley said. ''Oakland did a nice job of
not turning the ball over in a very tough defensive game. We've got
to work to eliminate the turnovers.''
</P>
<P>
   Leaf hadn't played in the regular season since Dec. 13, 1998,
when he mopped up in an embarrassing loss at Seattle. He said the
most difficult thing to adjust to was taking a beating and having
to bounce back.
</P>
<P>
   ''Honestly, it's going to feel good to be sore tomorrow, because
now I know I'm in there fighting with these guys,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Austria Expects EU Sanctions Report  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT WIELAARD
<TEXT>
<P>
   EVIAN, France (AP) -- Austria's foreign minister said Sunday she
expects a European Union review panel to release a report this week
urging an end to sanctions imposed against her country for the
inclusion of a far-right party in its coalition government.
</P>
<P>
   ''I expect a very objective, independent report'' that will urge
an early end to the sanctions, Foreign Minister Benita
Ferrero-Waldner told reporters during an EU foreign ministers
meeting in this lakeside resort.
</P>
<P>
   At weekend talks, Ferrero-Waldner lobbied her colleagues to bury
the mild diplomatic measures, which include boycotts of school
trips, cultural exchanges and military exercises.
</P>
<P>
   Since February, the EU has imposed sanctions against Austria
because the far-right Freedom Party, which is seen as opposing a
multicultural Western Europe, is in the government coalition of
Chancellor Wolfgang Schuessel.
</P>
<P>
   A special three-person panel was named July 12 to determine if
Austria's government respects ''common European values'' of
democracy and human rights, and whether the sanctions should remain
in place.
</P>
<P>
   Ferrero-Waldner's 14 EU counterparts remained tightlipped. The
report will be sent to President Jacques Chirac of France, whose
country holds the EU presidency.
</P>
<P>
   ''We must be patient and see what it says,'' said French Foreign
Minister Hubert Vedrine.
</P>
<P>
   Austria has set a mid-October deadline to end the measures or it
may stage a referendum in which Austrians will be asked what they
think of the sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   ''If it does not come to a lifting of sanctions I would be very
disillusioned,'' Ferrero-Waldner told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   The sanctions have polluted the atmosphere at EU meetings.
Opinion polls have shown a growing number of Austrians turning
against the EU.
</P>
<P>
   The sanctions have also raised the possibility that an angry
Austria could veto the EU's eastward expansion plans, a course of
action favored by Joerg Haider, the ex-Freedom Party leader who
remains an influential force in the party.

<HEADLINE> Construction workers drill Gore, Lieberman over cheesesteaks  </HEADLINE>
By MARYCLAIRE DALE
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) - Over cheesesteaks from Pat's Steaks, six
Philadelphia construction workers peppered Al Gore and Joe
Lieberman on Sunday with policy questions that affect their
families - from college costs to health insurance limits to the
adoption of special needs children.
</P>
<P>
   ''We surprised them, because for a half-dozen construction
workers, we're educated,'' 35-year-old electrician Tom Betteridge
said.
</P>
<P>
   For white men in the same field of work, they also have diverse
family lives.
</P>
<P>
   Electrician John McClay, 55, of Gloucester County, N.J., has two
kids in college, one at the University of Pennsylvania. His wife
just lost her job in Paulsboro, N.J., after the Exxon-Mobil merger.
</P>
<P>
   Carpenter Matt Haas, 45, and his wife, who live in
Franklinville, N.J., have adopted two children with special needs,
and have three of their own.
</P>
<P>
   Laborer Mike McLaughlin, 40, of Philadelphia, has a wife with
epilepsy that forced her to leave her job.
</P>
<P>
   Electrician Peter Misinkavitch, 38, of Jenkintown, has three
preschoolers and a teen. He is glad his wife could stay in the
hospital a second day following the birth of their younger
children.
</P>
<P>
   ''We asked about education, mental illness, health care,
Medicaid and jobs,'' Betteridge said.
</P>
<P>
   The group is working on a $160 million Hyatt Regency being built
at Penn's Landing in Philadelphia. Gore, the Democratic nominee for
president, and running mate Lieberman, a senator from Connecticut,
launched their frenetic, five-state Labor Day campaign swing at the
job site.
</P>
<P>
   The candidates talked in a small group with the selected workers
over dinner. Then they addressed a larger crowd of about 80 workers
and union leaders and a sprinkling of Democratic notables,
including Philadelphia Mayor John F. Street and Rep. Bob Brady.
</P>
<P>
   ''You are what this campaign is all about. You are what America
is all about,'' Gore told the group of mostly white, middle-aged
men - a demographic that Republican nominee George W. Bush seems to
be winning, polls suggest.
</P>
<P>
   McClay said later that his union local nearly went bust during
the city's economic downturn in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   ''In 1990 and 1991, we had 60 percent of our people out of
work,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Now, business is booming. Union electricians make about $33 an
hour after a five-year apprenticeship, a bit more than the other
construction trades, members said.
</P>
<P>
   McClay credits the turnaround in part to the 1992 election of
Gore and President Clinton, and to Ed Rendell's efforts as
Philadelphia's mayor.
</P>
<P>
   But the union also took an activist approach to job creation, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   According to McClay, the union decided to invest pension funds
in building projects like the one currently underway at Penn's
Landing. In exchange for the investment, they get a guarantee the
job will be done with union labor. They also hope the project has a
ripple effect on development in the area - offering them yet more
work in the future.
</P>
<P>
   After Gore's speech, Misinkavitch was asked what had appealed to
him.
</P>
<P>
   ''The working-class family stuff - lowering the deficit to
reduce taxes, the college deduction,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore had said that parents should be able to deduct the cost of
tuition if they help put their children through college.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've got four kids - that would be a big plus,'' he said.

<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) - A suspicious fire that started early Sunday
morning in the Bedford-Stuyvesant section of Brooklyn killed two
people, including a teen-ager, and injured five others, fire
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The fire began shortly before 7 a.m. in a three-story

burning full force when firefighters arrived minutes later, said
Firefighter Robert Calise.

   One resident, Armony Bevel, 18, was declared dead at the scene,
and an unidentified woman in her 60s died later at St. John's

condition, said Detective John Giammarino, a police spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Four firefighters were treated for injuries at Kings County
Medical Center and released, Calise said.
</P>
<P>
   The fire was deemed suspicious and was under investigation
because of its heavy volume and the speed with which it spread,
Calise said.

Gore: Bush's Debate Offer Not Enough
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- The presidential candidates squabbled over debate
schedules today as Republican George W. Bush announced he had accepted three
prime-time sessions. Democrat Al Gore rejected the plan, saying the formats
proposed by Bush could limit the audience and amount of face-to-face debate
time. Bush proposed debating Gore as soon as next week, or Sept. 12, during a
special edition of NBC's ''Meet the Press;'' Oct. 3 in Los Angeles on CNN's
''Larry King Live;'' and Oct. 17 at Washington University in St. Louis.

eye on the 22-page itinerary, dubbed ''Al and Joe's Hard Day's Night Tour,''

just how much the tire maker's recent high-profile problems have affected its
position at the bargaining table. A union spokesman denied that last month's
recall of 6.5 million Firestone tires and a government investigation into
accidents allegedly related to the tires have changed the nature of the contract
discussions, which have been ongoing since March. ''The negotiations started a
long time before any of these issues arose,'' said John Duray, spokesman for the

U.S. activists said Sunday at the end of a six-week experiment in living among
the Iraqi working class. Five members of the Chicago-based group, Voices in the
Wilderness, told a news conference at the Iraqi Trade Ministry that their stay
in a low-income district of the southern city of Basra had shown them that
sanctions crippled the ability of Iraqis to have safe water and food.

Myanmar Police Move Against Opposition

   YANGON, Myanmar (AP) -- Police and intelligence officers moved against
Myanmar's battered opposition party Sunday, surrounding the homes of its leaders
and effectively shutting down its nerve center in a crackdown that has triggered
international condemnation. The authoritarian military regime said senior
members of the opposition National League for Democracy party were ''requested
to stay at their respective residences.'' The crackdown followed what the
opposition said was the forced end to a nine-day standoff between the military
regime and opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi.

   ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Jim Edmonds beat the New York Mets with a home run for the
second time in three days, connecting in the 11th inning today as the St. Louis
Cardinals completed a three-game sweep with a 4-3 victory. The NL
Central-leading Cardinals have won seven of eight and are 5-0 in extra innings
overall. The Mets swept St. Louis twice earlier in the season, but lost all
three games of this series by one run on the final at-bat.

   TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) -- Florida State defensive lineman David
Warren must appear in court to answer to a misdemeanor charge of
simple battery, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Warren, 22, allegedly pushed his girlfriend, who received minor
scrapes when she fell to the ground. The incident occurred late
Saturday night at the Pebble Hill Apartments northwest of the FSU

<P>
   GALVESTON, Texas (AP) -- An unemployed shrimper lived with bodies
believed to be his dead parents for as long as two months,
authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   Sheriff's deputies who went to the home to check on the elderly
couple late Friday discovered their bodies in a bedroom where the
door had been taped shut, Galveston police Lt. Mike Putnal said.
</P>
<P>
   A daughter who lived out of town had reported Hollis Hisey, 85,
and Sunnye Hisey, 91, were missing.
</P>
<P>
   Putnal said David Sidney Hisey, 51, concealed the deaths to
collect his parents' retirement benefits. Autopsies were scheduled
to determine the cause of death, and police had not ruled out foul
play, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Hisey allowed police to enter the home Friday after repeated
visits by authorities, Putnal said.
</P>
<P>
   Hisey was being held in Galveston County Jail on $10,000 bail
for two counts of abuse of a corpse, a jail spokesman said. An
attorney had not been appointed by late Sunday.

<P>
   SANDY, Utah (AP) -- Andrew Morse won his first Buy.com Tour title
Sunday, closing with a 4-under-par 68 for a two-stroke victory over
John Riegger in the Utah Classic.
</P>
<P>
   Morse, 41, played 32 holes Sunday in the rain-plagued
tournament. After opening with rounds of 64 and 66, he shot a 71
Sunday morning en route to a 19-under 269 total.
</P>
<P>
   ''Basically, my career has been one stroke short,'' Morse said.
''Whether it be for a tournament or qualifying or the PGA Tour
school. But paying enough dues has finally come on the other side
of it. I'm two strokes ahead this time.''
</P>
<P>
   Morse earned $72,000 to jump from 59th to 18th on the money list
with $131,353. The top 15 at the end of the season will earn 2001
PGA Tour cards.
</P>
<P>
   Riegger shot a 67 on the Willow Creek course. Bo Van Pelt closed
with a 69 to finish third at 272.

<HEADLINE> Dodgers 6, Phillies 1  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Chan Ho Park won his fourth consecutive
start, allowing two hits over eight innings as the Los Angeles
Dodgers completed a three-game sweep of the Philadelphia Phillies
with a 6-1 victory Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   The Phillies' only hits off Park (15-8) were Scott Rolen's
two-out single in the first inning and Tomas Perez's leadoff single
in the eighth. The right-hander struck out six, tied a season high
with seven walks and induced three double-play grounders, while
matching his career high in victories.
</P>
<P>
   Park, who has won his last four starts, has not allowed more
than two earned runs in seven straight and is 5-1 with a 1.69 ERA
during that span.
</P>
<P>
   Park, still looking for his first complete game shutout in 136
career starts, came out after 131 pitches. He has left three games
this season after seven innings without allowing a run.
</P>
<P>
   Adrian Beltre and Shawn Green hit solo homers, and Gary
Sheffield had a pair of RBI singles for the Dodgers, whose pitching
staff limited the Phillies to one unearned run in the series.
</P>
<P>
   The Phillies have lost five straight. They've scored the fewest
runs in the majors, and until the ninth inning, had not scored
since the fourth inning Friday night, when Marlon Anderson came
home on Perez's groundout.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Lieberthal scored in the ninth when Anderson's dribbler up
the first-base line was mishandled by reliever Terry Adams.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Shaw retired Kevin Jordan with the bases loaded and two
outs for his 24th save in 31 chances, completing the four-hitter.
</P>
<P>
   Beltre, whose eighth-inning solo homer beat the Phillies 2-1 in
the series opener, hit his 16th leading off the fifth for a 2-0
lead against Robert Person (7-5). Mark Grudzielanek had an RBI
single later that inning and Green led off the sixth with his 24th
homer for a 4-0 margin.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers added two more in the seventh against Cliff Politte
with Sheffield's RBI single and Green's run-scoring groundout. Park
ignited the rally with a leadoff single.
</P>
<P>
   Person threw a strike on only one of his first 12 pitches. He
walked Tom Goodwin and Grudzielanek, then fell behind Sheffield 3-0
before giving up an RBI single to Sheffield on a 3-2 pitch with the
runners going.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles has won 11 of 14 and a season-best six straight at
home, but remains seven games behind San Francisco in the NL West
and 6 1-2 games out of a wild card spot.
</P>
<P>
   Person was charged with four runs and five hits in six innings.
</P>
<P>
Notes: The Phillies did not score an earned run against Dodgers
pitching for 28 consecutive innings. ... Person leads the Phillies'
staff with 77 walks. ... The three-game sweep was the Dodgers'
first against the Phillies since August 1997, at Veterans Stadium,
and enabled them to win the season series (5-4) for the fifth
straight year. ... Park (.216) and Person (.220) entered the game
3-4 in the NL in lowest opponents' batting average against. Only
Kevin Brown and Randy Johnson were better. ... Dodgers pitching
coach Claude Osteen held that same position in Philadelphia from
1982-88, when the Phillies produced three Cy Young winners -- Steve
Carlton, John Denny and reliever Steve Bedrosian. ... Lieberthal,
who last year became only the sixth catcher in major league history
with a .300 average and 30 home runs in a season, is hitting .280
with 15 homers this year. ... Dodgers SS Alex Cora returned to the
lineup after leaving Friday's game because of the flu.

<HEADLINE> 5.2 Quake Hits Calif. Wine Country  </HEADLINE>
By CHRISTINE HANLEY
<TEXT>
<P>
   NAPA, Calif. (AP) -- The heart of Northern California's wine
country was sharply jolted early Sunday by an earthquake that
smashed windows and glassware and knocked out power to thousands.
</P>
<P>
   Two people were hospitalized, one a 5-year-old boy in critical
condition.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was like someone was just holding the house and shaking it
violently,'' said Alison Saether, who said plaster fell from the
ceiling of her Napa home. ''We were so panicked we couldn't even
move.''
</P>
<P>
   Sunday afternoon, downtown streets were thick with tourists
visiting shops and restaurants and attending a weekend festival.
Yellow police tape kept people away from areas where glass had
shattered, and temporary stop signs were placed at intersections
where traffic signals weren't working.
</P>
<P>
   The quake hit at 1:36 a.m. and measured a magnitude 5.2. It was
centered about 6 miles northwest of Napa, near the small town of
Yountville, according to the U.S. Geological Survey in Menlo Park.
</P>
<P>
   Two aftershocks by afternoon measured magnitudes 1.5 and 1.8,
and as many as 20 small aftershocks might be felt in the next week,
according to the USGS.
</P>
<P>
   A magnitude 5 quake can cause considerable damage in the
immediate area and one of magnitude 6 can cause severe damage.
</P>
<P>
   The shaking woke people as far south as San Francisco, some 50
miles away.
</P>
<P>
   ''This was by far the most severe I've ever felt,'' said
California Highway Patrol spokesman Mark Bunger, who said he has
lived in the Napa area his whole life. ''Usually it's a rolling,
but this was more of a real jolting. My wife and kids were
screaming. It was quite upsetting.''
</P>
<P>
   He said his house in nearby Browns Valley had cracked plaster
but no major damage.
</P>
<P>
   Power was restored by Sunday afternoon to most of the 10,000
customers who lost service, according to Pacific Gas &AMP; Electric Co.
spokesman Jonathan Franks.
</P>
<P>
   Numerous homes had damaged chimneys.
</P>
<P>
   ''We shook twice, back to back, with everything swaying, like a
waterbed,'' said dispatcher Rick Wallace of the Sonoma County
Sheriff's Department in Santa Rosa, about 30 miles northwest of the
quake's epicenter.
</P>
<P>
   A few wineries reported minor damage. ''We lost about three
bottles,'' said Lessly Van Houtan, who works in the tasting room of
Carneros Creek winery.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everything is knocked off the shelves. Everything is broken,''
said Mark Christianson, a Long's Drugs store manager.
</P>
<P>
   At least 25 people were treated for injuries, mostly minor cuts,
said Denise Mace, spokeswoman for Queen of the Valley Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   ''When the quake hit, it dumped everything on the floor. There
was glass everywhere,'' said Jerry Marquez, 33, who was being
treated for cuts on his feet.
</P>
<P>
   One man was in serious condition at the hospital and a
5-year-old boy was in critical condition because of head injuries
caused by falling objects, Mace said. The boy underwent surgery at
Oakland Children's Hospital.

<HEADLINE> Democrats on 27-Hour Campaign Dash  </HEADLINE>
By SANDRA SOBIERAJ
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Al Gore and Joseph Lieberman brought
sandwiches -- cheesesteaks, of course -- for a Sunday night
construction crew as the Democrats began a manic 27-hour dash
through six states designed to catch the working man's eye. ''You
are what this campaign is all about,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   Running mate Lieberman pledged, ''No one will work harder for
the hard-working middle class families of America than Al Gore and
Joe Lieberman. Give us a chance.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House hopefuls, launching their extraordinary Labor
Day tour, carried in about 100 of Pat's ''King of Steaks''
specialties, then used Styrofoam slabs to cushion the plastic tubs
fashioned into dinner chairs. Lieberman, an Orthodox Jew, only
pretended to nibble on the non-kosher meal.
</P>
<P>
   With an eye on the 22-page itinerary, dubbed ''Al and Joe's Hard
Day's Night Tour,'' Lieberman joked: ''I'm beginning to think vice
presidential candidates should have collective bargaining rights.''
</P>
<P>
   Union workers, mostly white men and some in hard hats, cheered
''Go Al, go!''
</P>
<P>
   With that image, superimposed on the grueling schedule, Gore
hoped to cramp Republican rival George W. Bush's support -- so far
unbudging in polls -- among working-class men, particularly whites.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you want a job done right on our economic policies take a
look at the blueprint,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Joe and I are offering a blueprint that will keep our budget
balanced, keep investing in new jobs ... keep interest rates low,
pass middle-class tax cuts, make sure that our prosperity enriches
not just the few but all of our families,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Gore said he ''will not accept the blueprint from the other side
that proposes to give away all of the (budget) surplus in a giant
tax cut for the wealthy.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, in an interview, Gore told The Associated Press his
goal was to ''honor the families that work hard to pay the bills
and make ends meet. ... They're the ones I want my presidency to be
about.''
</P>
<P>
   But Republicans want it to be about Gore's credibility, as
highlighted in a new television ad that began airing over the
weekend. It features Gore's 1996 visit to a Buddhist temple and his
1999 claim to have created the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if there was an alternative lesson Gore would like voters
to take from those two missteps, he replied: ''I'm for campaign
finance reform and I am for using our current prosperity to make
sure that everybody benefits from new advances in e-commerce.''
</P>
<P>
   The campaign was nearly giddy about the all-nighter, passing out
t-shirts that declared, ''I survived 24 hours, 5 cities, 0 sleep,''
and hats from the CBS-TV hit ''Survivor.''
</P>
<P>
   Outside the cheesesteak hut, Banani Scott, 29, an electrician
working three jobs to support two kids and the kind of guy Gore is
after, was unimpressed.
</P>
<P>
   ''These guys are running around to show the people, 'We're down
with 'em,' then the next three or four years we won't see hide nor
hair of them. Nothing will change for me,'' said Scott, who added
he doesn't like Bush either.
</P>
<P>
   Thunderstorms ruined plans to drop by a south Philadelphia block
party, so Gore and Lieberman settled for pizza and football at
Doc's Union Pub.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Pizzo, 55, a teacher juggling two shots and a beer, said
Gore was ''demonstrating what he can do under strain, demonstrating
his physical prowess and mental acumen.''
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman told reporters that any explicit comparison to the
pace of the GOP ticket will be up to the American people and news
media. Gore seemed to draw a parallel with the Philadelphia Eagles'
''messing with Texas'' upset Sunday of the Dallas Cowboys, saying
the game was ''a momentum builder and season changer.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush spokesman Dan Bartlett retorted: ''Twenty-four hours of
campaign promises cannot erase eight years of inaction on tax cuts
for working families, prescription drugs for our seniors, and a
'real' patients bill of rights.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore's communications director, Mark Fabiani, said it was
serendipity that Gore and Lieberman's ''work-athon'' would wind
through the key electoral battlegrounds of Pennsylvania, Michigan,
Florida, Kentucky, Ohio and Illinois as Bush has had to defend the
pace of his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ''When we planned this, we didn't know what Bush was doing. It's
hard to believe he has such a light Labor Day schedule, but that's
his choice,'' Fabiani said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush still made news Sunday, announcing he had agreed to three
debates with Gore. For the Labor Day holiday, which traditionally
kicks off the quadrennial fall campaign for the White House, Bush
planned one stop in Naperville, Ill., and another in Romeo, Mich.
</P>
<P>
   After Philadelphia, about 300 union enthusiasts greeted the
Democrats in heavily blue-collar Flint, Mich. ''This team is going
to work its heart out,'' Lieberman said before they moved on to
greet night shift workers at Hurley Medical Center.
</P>
<P>
   Next, was Tampa, Fla., for a 5 a.m. Monday breakfast with
firefighters and a pair of nostalgic sidetrips -- Gore to an
all-night diner like the one where his mother waitressed; Lieberman
to a bakery because his dad drove a bakery delivery truck.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, the two were to split up, with Gore flying to the
Pittsburgh Labor Day parade and rally with AFL-CIO President John
Sweeney, then to Louisville, Ky., for an evening rally at the motor
speedway. Lieberman was breaking off for Detroit, Toledo, Ohio, and
Peoria, Ill.
</P>
<P>
   The centerpiece of Gore's campaign week is an economic address
Wednesday in Cleveland.

Gore: Bush's Debate Offer Too Narrow
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- The presidential candidates squabbled over debate
schedules today as Republican George W. Bush announced he had accepted three
prime-time sessions, including one next week. Democrat Al Gore rejected the
plan, saying the formats proposed by Bush could limit the audience and amount of
face-to-face debate time. Bush proposed debating Gore as soon as next week, or
Sept. 12, during a special edition of NBC's ''Meet the Press;'' Oct. 3 in Los
Angeles on CNN's ''Larry King Live;'' and Oct. 17 at Washington University in
St. Louis. The proposal also includes two vice presidential debates: Oct. 11 in
Winston-Salem, N.C., and a later forum yet to be decided, Bush said.

Lieberman Urged To Drop Senate Bid
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The senator in charge of getting Democrats elected to the
Senate wants Sen. Joseph Lieberman to quit his re-election campaign and deny
Connecticut's governor the chance to give his seat to a Republican if Lieberman
wins the vice presidency. Connecticut Democrats nominated Lieberman at their
state convention July 14, three weeks before Democratic presidential candidate
Al Gore chose him as his running mate. Lieberman said today that replacing him
by committee now would cause ''a lot of chaos'' for the party. ''The U.S. Senate
seat is too important to be filled on the run,'' he said. As chairman of the
Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, Sen. Robert Torricelli, D-N.J., is
leading the party's drive to win the seats necessary to overcome the
Republicans' 54-46 advantage in the Senate.

Negotiators Continue Tire Talks

<P>
   ST. LOUIS (AP) -- With Bridgestone/Firestone Inc. and union leaders remaining
tight-lipped about their ongoing contract negotiations today, it remains unclear
just how much the tire maker's recent high-profile problems have affected its
position at the bargaining table. A union spokesman denied that last month's
recall of 6.5 million Firestone tires and a government investigation into
accidents allegedly related to the tires have changed the nature of the contract
discussions, which have been ongoing since March. ''The negotiations started a
long time before any of these issues arose,'' said John Duray, spokesman for the

Damp Weather Helps Fire Fight

   HELENA, Mont. (AP) -- Rain and even snow helped firefighters make major
progress to contain western wildfires today, although a blaze sparked by
lightning forced the evacuation of a national monument on a busy Labor Day
weekend. Four tour buses and hundreds of tourists were turned away today from
Devils Tower National Monument in northeastern Wyoming because a 1,550-acre fire
was burning about 2&AMP;frac12; miles away, officials said. The damp conditions
helped firefighters make considerable progress, said Neil Hitchcock of the
National Interagency Fire Center in Boise, Idaho. ''We may have turned the
corner on the fires in Montana and Idaho, but we aren't out of the woods yet,''
he said.

   NEW YORK (AP) -- Storms came and went, day turned to night, and after more
than eight hours of playing, waiting and playing again in brutal energy-sapping
humidity, Magnus Norman barely escaped the biggest exodus of top seeded men in
U.S. Open history. His red shirt soaked as if he'd been swimming in it, Norman
fell to his knees and pumped his fist over and over to the feverish fans after
the final point tonight in a 3-6, 4-6, 7-6 (5), 6-4, 7-6 (9) comeback against an
inspired but drained and cramping Max Mirnyi.

   DEL MAR, Calif. (AP) -- El Corredor beat Cliquot by 2&AMP;frac12; lengths
Sunday in the $250,600 Del Mar Breeders' Cup Handicap.
</P>
<P>

Bush Agrees to 3 Debates With Gore
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- As Republican George W. Bush announced he had accepted
three prime-time sessions, presidential candidates squabbled over debate
schedules Sunday. Democrat Al Gore rejected the plan, saying the formats
proposed by Bush could limit the audience and amount of face-to-face debate
time. Bush proposed debating Gore as soon as next week, or Sept. 12, during a
special edition of NBC's ''Meet the Press;'' Oct. 3 in Los Angeles on CNN's
''Larry King Live;'' and Oct. 17 at Washington University in St. Louis. The
proposal also includes two vice presidential debates: Oct. 11 in Winston-Salem,
N.C., and a later forum yet to be decided, Bush said.

Lieberman Urged To Drop Senate Bid
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The senator in charge of getting Democrats elected to the
Senate wants Sen. Joseph Lieberman to quit his re-election campaign and deny
Connecticut's governor the chance to give his seat to a Republican if Lieberman
wins the vice presidency. Connecticut Democrats nominated Lieberman at their
state convention July 14, three weeks before Democratic presidential candidate
Al Gore chose him as his running mate. Lieberman said Sunday that replacing him
by committee now would cause ''a lot of chaos'' for the party. ''The U.S. Senate
seat is too important to be filled on the run,'' he said. As chairman of the
Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, Sen. Robert Torricelli, D-N.J., is
leading the party's drive to win the seats necessary to overcome the
Republicans' 54-46 advantage in the Senate.

Studies Support Moderate Exercise
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Harder exercise is better, but even moderate regular
exercise can reduce a man's risk of heart disease -- and the exercise doesn't
have to be done in one burst, new research shows. The findings, from a long,
large ongoing project, show a benefit that lasts over decades. And they support
federal recommendations that people should do 30 minutes a day of at least
moderate exercise, in at least 10-minute segments, most days of the week. ''What
we didn't know is, by adhering to this pattern of exercise, that translated into
long-term benefits,'' said Howard D. Sesso of Harvard School of Public Health.
He worked on two studies that were reported in Circulation, a journal of the
American Heart Association.

SUV Crash Kills 1; Tire Tread Split
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   ENCINAL, Texas (AP) -- A sport utility vehicle overturned and landed on its
roof off an interstate in southern Texas on Sunday, killing a 10-year-old and
injuring six other people. The tread had clearly separated from one back tire.
Authorities didn't know if the tread separation had contributed to the accident
or was a result of the vehicle skidding off the highway and rolling. Jose
Martinez, deputy chief of the Webb County Sheriff's Department, said a shredded
tire on the vehicle possibly was related to the recent Bridgestone/Firestone
recalls and that it would be investigated further. The vehicle was a Ford
Explorer with Firestone tires.

Negotiators Continue Tire Talks
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS (AP) -- With Bridgestone/Firestone Inc. and union leaders remaining
tight-lipped about their ongoing contract negotiations Sunday, it remains
unclear just how much the tire maker's recent high-profile problems have
affected its position at the bargaining table. A union spokesman denied that
last month's recall of 6.5 million Firestone tires and a government
investigation into accidents allegedly related to the tires have changed the
nature of the contract discussions, which have been ongoing since March. ''The
negotiations started a long time before any of these issues arose,'' said John
Duray, spokesman for the United Steelworkers of America.

U.S. Open: Norman Beats Mirnyi
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Storms came and went, day turned to night, and after more
than eight hours of playing, waiting and playing again in brutal energy-sapping
humidity, Magnus Norman barely escaped the biggest exodus of top seeded men in
U.S. Open history. His red shirt soaked as if he'd been swimming in it, Norman
fell to his knees and pumped his fist over and over to the feverish fans after
the final point tonight in a 3-6, 4-6, 7-6 (5), 6-4, 7-6 (9) comeback against an
inspired but drained and cramping Max Mirnyi.

Dodgers Beat Phillies 6-1
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Chan Ho Park won his fourth consecutive start, allowing
two hits over eight innings as the Los Angeles Dodgers completed a three-game
sweep of the Philadelphia Phillies with a 6-1 victory Sunday night. The
Phillies' only hits off Park (15-8) were Scott Rolen's two-out single in the
first inning and Tomas Perez's leadoff single in the eighth. The right-hander
struck out six, tied a season high with seven walks and induced three
double-play grounders, while matching his career high in victories.
