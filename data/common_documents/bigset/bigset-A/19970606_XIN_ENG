<HEADLINE> Four DKB Officials Arrested as Racketeer Scandal Grows </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, June 5 (Xinhua) -- Four officials of a top Japanese
commercial bank were arrested today for involvement in a widening
corporate racketeering scandal that also involves the country's
biggest brokerage.
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors said the four officials of Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank Ltd
(DKB) were arrested on suspicion of violating the Commercial Code
by allegedly loaning 11.78 billion yen (101 million U.S. dollars)
to a racketeer.
</P>
<P>
The racketeer, Ryuichi Koike, is the leading member of a band
of racketeers known as "sokaiya" who extort money from companies
by threatening to ask embarrassing and sensitive questions about
their business activities at shareholder meetings.
</P>
<P>
The country's top brokerage, Nomura Securities Co. Ltd, has
been involved in the pay-off scandal to buy Koike's silence at
shareholder meetings.
</P>
<P>
"Sokaiya" buy stakes in firms to gain admission to the annual
shareholder meetings. Their activities were outlawed in 1982 but
the practice flourished nevertheless.
</P>
<P>
The four arrested DKB officials were all linked to the bank's
general affairs department, which traditionally handles dealings
with "sokaiya."
</P>
<P>
They included former director Hiroshi Inotsume and current
general manager Tatsuo Shibuya.
</P>
<P>
The arrests were made a day after prosecutors linked Nomura
itself to the scandal, suggesting the company has violated
securities laws by compensating Koike's younger brother for
trading losses.
</P>
<P>
Former Nomura President Hideo Sakamaki and two former managing
directors of the brokerage have been arrested for conspiring to
give cash to Koike.

<HEADLINE> Mongolia Courts Foreign Investors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ULAN BATOR, June 5 (Xinhua) -- A two-day international fair to
attract foreign investment in Mongolia's natural gas and mining
industries ended today.
</P>
<P>
Some 105 companies from 20 countries including China, the
United States, Canada, Britain and Russia, and more than 60
Mongolian companies attended the fair co-sponsored by the
Mongolian government and the World Bank.
</P>
<P>
The foreign companies were briefed on Mongolia's investment
policies and held talks with relevant Mongolian companies or
ministries on possible investment opportunities.
</P>
<P>
Although the Mongolian government had outlined a strategy of
attracting foreign investment to develop its domestic economy,
little progress has been made in recent years because of the poor
infrastructure and the lack of a comprehensive legal system.
</P>
<P>
Since 1990, foreign enterprises have invested only 123 million
U.S. dollars and set up 540 joint ventures in Mongolia.
</P>
<P>
In a bid to change the situation, the Mongolian government has
adopted some preferential policies including exemption from
taxation for all imports except tobacco and liquor and
simplification of customs formalities.

<HEADLINE> Ex-CIA Spy to be Sentenced in US </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 5 (Xinhua) -- U.S. double-spy Harold Nicholson
will be sentenced today in Alexandria, Virginia, probably to less
24 years in prison.
</P>
<P>
Federal prosecutors have recommended that Nicholson should
serve under 24 years in prison, instead of a life sentence,
because he is very cooperative with the government in helping
gauge the harm cause by his sellout to Moscow.
</P>
<P>
On March 3, Nicholson, 46, pleaded guilty to conspiracy to
commit espionage by selling the names and positions of a large
number of U.S. intelligence officers to Moscow.
</P>
<P>
He served as the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) station
chief in Romania from 1990 to 1992 before becoming deputy chief of
station and operations in Malaysia. From 1994 to 1996, Nicholson
served as a trainer for CIA recruits.
</P>
<P>
Nicholson confessed to having started spying for Moscow in June
1994 and admitted collecting 300,000 U.S. dollars from the
Russians.
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors said that Nicholson has "fully cooperated" and
"substantially" helped the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI)
and CIA in the investigation.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, they said, 23 years and seven months imprisonment is
"a sufficient and appropriate punishment" for his crime.

<P>
MUNICH, June 5 (Xinhua) -- China and Germany have enjoyed good
relations with frequent political contacts and expanding
cooperation in recent years, Li Ruihuan, chairman of the Chinese
People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) said today.
</P>
<P>
He was speaking on his arrival in Munich, the capital
of the German state Bavaria, for a seven-day official
goodwill visit to Germany, the first by a CPPCC chairman.
</P>
<P>
He was greeted at the airport by the state secretary of the
Ministry for Economy, Transportation and Technology of Bavaria,
Hans Spitzer and Chinese ambassador to Germany Lu Qiutian.
</P>
<P>
During his visit, Li is scheduled to meet German President
Roman Herzog, Chancellor Helmut Kohl, Foreign Minister Klaus
Kinkel, and Rita Suessmuth, president of the Bundestag (the lower
house of parliament).
</P>
<P>
He will hold talks with them on bilateral ties and other issues

<HEADLINE> Iraq Raps AL's Indifference over Turkish Incursion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, June 5 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi Foreign Minister Saeed
al-Sahhaf today complained to the Cairo-based Arab League(AL)
about its indifference over Turkey's recent military incursion
into northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
He voiced the grievance in a message sent to AL Secretary
General Esmat Abdel Meguid by Iraq's permanent representative to
the league Nabil Nejm today.
</P>
<P>
"The Turkish shelling of Iraqi towns and villages is an
outright violation of our territorial integrity and runs counter
to the principles of good neighborliness," Sahhaf said in the
message detailing the ongoings in northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Sahhaf also criticized the AL Council's "indifferent stance."
With the support of air bombing and artillery fire, about 25,000
to 50,000 Turkish troops have pushed across the border into
northern Iraq assaulting the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) rebels
since May 14.
</P>
<P>
Warning that such practices will shake the stability of the
Middle East, however, he said the league itself showed "no
interest towards the Turkish invasion of north Iraq."
</P>
<P>
Iraq retains its legitimate right to respond to Turkish
offensives and to request compensation for the damages inflicted
on the Iraqi people, he added.
</P>
<P>
He called on the Turkish government to re-examine its policies
towards northern Iraq and establish cooperation on the basis of
good neighborliness and mutual respect of sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, Chief of Staff of the Turkish Armed
Forces General Ismail Haqqi ordered all army commanders not to
leave the country and put off any external visits to the end of
August, according to press reports reaching here today.
</P>
<P>
The orders came at a time when the Turkish forces that crossed
into north Iraq for the destruction of all PKK bases are reported
to remain there until the end of August.
</P>
<P>
The Arab League and regional countries have condemned the
continued Turkish incursion and urged an immediate troop
withdrawal. Turkey defended its move as purely designed to purge
the Kurdish rebels.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Leader Meets Greek Foreign Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, June 5 (Xinhua) -- Chairman of the National Committee
of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference Li
Ruihuan said today that through his visit to Greece he deeply
feels the Sino-Greek friendship has a profound social foundation.
</P>
<P>
During his meeting with Greek Foreign Minister Theodoros
Pangalos here today, Li also said the friendly relations between
China and Greece have proved the truth that in the state-to-state
exchanges, the principles of mutual respect, mutual understanding
and mutual support should be followed.
</P>
<P>
He said countries, big or small, rich or poor, should be
treated on an equal footing. Under no pretext and by no means
should big countries bully the small ones, the strong one suppress
the weak ones, nor should one constrain the other, he said.
</P>
<P>
He also said that different countries have different historical
backgrounds, cultural traditions and styles of life, and
therefore, the policy-decision of each country is made according
to its actual conditions. Each country should try to understand
the decision of another country, he added.
</P>
<P>
He said it is also necessary for countries to inform each other
of the situation on major issues, coordinate and cooperate, and
help each other in times of difficulty.
</P>
<P>
In response, the Greek foreign minister said he shares views
with Li, stressing that only by treating each other on an equal
footing, can the issues of common concern to various countries be
solved reasonably.
</P>
<P>
Pangalos also said that as there is diversification in the
world culture, the world political power should be balanced and
multi-polarized. Greece stands for a unified and strong Europe in
the form of federation and Europe should be one of the
decision-making centers for international affairs, he added.
</P>
<P>
He said Greece opposes any form of hegemonism. He added that
China's cultural traditions, past sufferings and current state
policies have shown that it has not practiced, and will not
practice, hegemonism.
</P>
<P>
He said he believes that Greece and China share identical views
in this regard, which serves as a foundation for their friendly
bilateral ties and cooperation.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Welcomes US Appointment of New Emissary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, June 5 (Xinhua) -- The Cypriot government welcomed
today the appointment of Richard Holbrooke as new U.S.
Presidential Emissary for Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
"Bearing in mind U.S. assurances for active, substantial and
dynamic presence in direct talks and for support to U.N. efforts
toward a Cyprus settlement, we expressed our satisfaction with
Holbrooke's appointment," Government Spokesman Manolis
Christofides told reporters at his daily press briefing here.
</P>
<P>
U.S. State Department Spokesman Nicholas Burns officially
announced Wednesday the appointment of Richard Holbrooke, the
former assistant secretary of state for European affairs, as
President Bill Clinton's emissary for Cyprus, to replace Richard
Beattie, the emissary in Clinton's previous term of office.
</P>
<P>
Holbrooke, known for his tough bargaining style, achieved his
fame by negotiating the 1995 Dayton peace agreement which ended
a 43-month civil war in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman pointed out that the Cypriot government hopes
for a just solution to the Cyprus problem which will be in line
with what he termed as universal values the U.N. and the U.S. have
pledged to abide by.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Cypriot Foreign Minister Ioannis Kasoulides, who is
currently in Washington to have a meeting with U.S. Secretary
of State Madeleine Albright, also voiced his welcome to the
appointment.
</P>
<P>
He said today that the appointment "sends messages regarding
the determination with which the U.S. government will work
towards a solution to the Cyprus issue."
</P>
<P>
Observers here noted that Holbrooke's appointment came just a
month before the U.N.-sponsored direct negotiations between the
Greek and Turkish Cypriot sides begin in New York.
</P>
<P>
The Cyprus issue has remained unsolved since 1974 when the
island was divided after Turkish troops occupied its northern
third in the wake of an Athens-backed coup.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia Launches Environmental Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, June 5 (Xinhua) -- The Ethiopian government today
launched its environmental policy to mark this year's World
Environment Day.
</P>
<P>
The environmental policy has an overall objective to improve and
enhance the health and quality of life of all Ethiopians and to
promote sustainable social and economic development through the
sound management and use of natural, man-made and cultural resources.
</P>
<P>
It also seeks to ensure that the benefits from the exploitation of
non-renewable resources are extended as far into the future as can
be managed, and minimize the negative impacts of their exploitation.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the launching ceremony here, Minister of Agriculture
Seifu Ketama said the environmental policy of Ethiopia is a
derivation of part of the conservation strategy of Ethiopia and is
aimed to guide all environment related activities which are
undertaken or must be undertaken by the environmental protection
authority and the other sectors.
</P>
<P>
The formulation of the conservation strategy of Ethiopia was
conducted in three phases following the signing of the first project
agreement between the government of Ethiopia and the World
Conservation Union, the minister added.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia loses 80,000 to 200,000 hectares of forest annually.

<HEADLINE> Iraqi Paper Attacks U.S. Military Presence in Gulf </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, June 5 (Xinhua) -- An Iraqi newspaper here today
strongly criticized the continuation of the U.S. military
presence in the Gulf region "under various pretexts."
</P>
<P>
In an editorial, Ath-thawra, organ of the ruling Arab Ba'th
Socialist Party, said the gulf people are well aware that the
presence of the U.S. forces, with their bases, troops and
maneuvers on their land and at sea, violates their countries'
sovereignty and constitutes a direct pressure on their political
decision-making.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. has stationed 25,000 soldiers, 80 fighters and 35
warships in the Gulf, the paper said, claiming that about 40
billion dollars is used to cover the costs of their presence.
</P>
<P>
The real reason behind the U.S. presence here is not, as the
Americans claim, that they provide protection for the Gulf states
from an Iraqi threat first and an Iranian threat second.
</P>
<P>
It aims to achieve political and financial purposes represented
in the U.S. desire to impose hegemony over the region's strategic
oil resources now and in the future, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
The Gulf states have to solve their problems by themselves and
in their own special way, said the paper, adding that the
Americans are "not but strangers who hate the Arabs and Islam and
hate to see the Arabs unified."
</P>
<P>
Seven years ago, Iraq troops were defeated and driven out of
Kuwait after their nearly six-month occupation, by U.S-led allied
forces in the Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. has since maintained a large number of forces in the
region to carry out its so-called "dual-containment" policy in
order, as it said, to protect the Gulf states such as Kuwait and
Saudi Arabia from a potential threat posed by Iraq and to deter
Iran.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Deems Upcoming Direct Talks Important </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, June 5 (Xinhua) -- The Cypriot government considered
the forthcoming direct talks between the Greek and Turkish
Cypriots particularly important, a government spokesman said here
today.
</P>
<P>
At his daily press briefing, spokesman Manolis Christofides
said the talks have been endorsed by the permanent member of the
U.N. Security Council, and "this is the first time that so many
have shown such an interest simultaneously in a Cyprus solution."
</P>
<P>
According to the spokesman, representatives of Britain,
France, Russian and the United States will be present at the
face-to-face negotiations between President Glafcos Clerides and
Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash, scheduled for July near
the U.N. headquarters of New York.
</P>
<P>
China, he said, has yet to nominate its representative but it
has shown interest in the Cyprus issue.
</P>
<P>
Christofides expected progress to be achieved in the direct
talks, saying that this expectation is boosted by the action of
states that are keen on a Cyprus settlement.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Cypriot Foreign Minister Ioannis Kasoulides has
expressed the country's political will to take part in the
U.N.-proposed direct talks in a positive and constructive way in
order to achieve the island's reunification the soonest possible.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a meeting Wednesday night in Washington, Kasoulides
said "we must show the world that we want our country to be
reunited, that we want reconciliation in Cyprus, that we want to
live in peace with our fellow citizens, the Turkish Cypriots, and
that the future is common for all Cypriots in our country."
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that if Greek and Turkish Cypriots were left
alone without what he called foreign intervention and the
presence of Turkish occupation troops, they will live peacefully
and "we can have a bright future for everybody on our island."
</P>
<P>
Kasoulides said "time is running against us and therefore, we
want a Cyprus solution to come as quickly as possible."
</P>
<P>
He assured that the Greek Cypriot side will attend the July
direct talks near New York "with an open mind" and with "a
spirit ready to negotiate in a positive and constructive way."
</P>
<P>
"If the other side (of Turkish Cypriots) comes with a similar
political will and with a similar spirit then we will be able to
celebrate the withdrawal of the Turkish occupation army, the
restoration of the basic freedoms, the reunification of our
country, the reconciliation of all Cypriots and a peaceful
future for our children in our beloved island," the minister
said.
</P>
<P>
This eastern Mediterranean island has been divided since 1974
when Turkish troops occupied the northern third of the island in
the wake of a short-lived coup seeking union with Greece.
</P>
<P>
Peace efforts made by the U.N. and international community for
the past 23 years have achieved no tangible results for a solution
to the Cyprus' problem.

INGOLSTADT, Germany, June 5 (Xinhua) -- Chinese leader Li

carmaker Audi AG after arriving at the southern German city of
Munich for a seven-day official goodwill visit to the country.
</P>
<P>
Li, chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's
Political Consultative Conference, was greeted by Erich Schmitt,

<HEADLINE> French PM to Balance Social Action, Growth With Euro </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, June 5 (Xinhua) -- French Prime Minister Lionel Jospin
is committed to his campaign promise to balance the relationship
of social action and economic growth with the plan to launch the
European single currency, euro, Minister for European Affairs
Pierre Moscovici said today.
</P>
<P>
"The commitment of Lionel Jospin will be held," Moscovici told
journalists when he was taking over the office of the Ministry for
European Affairs from his predecessor Michel Barnier.
</P>
<P>
Jospin promised to reorient France's policy on Europe by
emphasizing more on the social aspects of Europe and pushing
forward economic growth and job creation in France.
</P>
<P>
Moscovici said that Jospin based his legislative campaign on
the promise to maintain a balance between social construction in
France and its integration with the rest of Europe.
</P>
<P>
Jospin also said that European construction must conform with
the national interests of France.
</P>
<P>
"This means notably that on the basic issue of single currency
and growth, we will hold our commitments," said Moscovici, who
described as "indispensable" these conditions offered by France
for continuing to join the process of European integration.
</P>
<P>
Asked about the relationship between France and Germany, he
said that the Franco-German partnership remains "quite important,"
while the Franco-British relations could also be further
developed.

<HEADLINE> Blair to Urge Germany to Go Ahead With Eurofighter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 5 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony Blair
has promised to urge German Chancellor Helmut Kohl to sign up to
the final phases of the Eurofighter program during his brief visit
to Germany Friday.
</P>
<P>
Blair was quoted by local press reports as saying Wednesday
night that the 40-billion-pound (about 65 billion U.S. dollar)
project was important for British defense and jobs.
</P>
<P>
"We will be doing everything we can to see the project out,"
Blair said.
</P>
<P>
Defense experts predict that the four-nation European fighter
project, involving Germany, Britain, Spain and Italy, is expected
to create some 100,000 jobs in Britain.
</P>
<P>
The four countries were supposed to sign the production
investment agreement which would allow each of the four nations to
build the production lines last year, but the German government,
which needs budget cuts in an effort to qualify for the single
European currency, has demanded delays in funding the program.
</P>
<P>
In other developments, German Defense Minister Volker Ruehe
held talks with visiting British Defense Secretary George
Robertson in Bonn Wednesday to exchange views on the Eurofighter
program, but no breakthrough has so far emerged.

<HEADLINE> Basic Science Teaching to Be Improved in Tanzania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, June 5 (Xinhua) --The Tanzanian government is
determined to improve the teaching of basic science in
primary and secondary schools.
</P>
<P>
Receving the visiting Executive Director of the Third World
Academy of Sciences, Mohamed Hassan this morning, Mkapa noted
that the deteoration of science education in Africa was mainly
due to the prevailing economic situation, whereby most national
budgets in the continent fail to give adequate support for the
education sector.
</P>
<P>
"In Tanzania a program is underway to resume the provision of
practical science classes in full as soon as possible in order to
meet the demands of science and technology in the 21st century,"
Mkapa said.
</P>
<P>
According to a press statement issued by the State House,
Mkapa said that the provision of basic science education in
primary and secondary schools, which should be seen as a lead to
the training of innovative and inventive scientists, needed
international co-operation and support.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the president hailed the Third World Academy of
Sciences, which was created under the initiative of the
South-South co-operation, for its efforts to finance the
development of scientific work in the third world.
</P>
<P>
In this respect, Mkapa called for an African regional special
consideration in the imparting of science and technology as the
continent lagged behind Latin American and Asian states.

<HEADLINE> Collaborative Efforts Called for in Environment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, June 5 (Xinhua) -- Chairman of the National
Environmental Management Council of Tanzania (NEMC) Reginal Mengi
today called for collaborative efforts for environmental
protection.
</P>
<P>
"Environmental conservation is not the duty of the government
alone. It is the duty of everybody. Let us from now on, bring our
efforts together in conserving our environment. Let us do that with
all efforts," Mengi stresed.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks in a paper on environmental degradation
and pollution in Tanzania at a workshop organised to mark the
World Enviornment Day.
</P>
<P>
Mengi said as it was insisted during the 1992 environmental
conference held in Rio De Janciro, efforts to conserve and protect the
environment would succeed only if everybody took part in implementing
environmental related plans and programs.
</P>
<P>
"If we want to win the war against poverty, we have to conserve our
environment. We will never attain the social and economic development
without taking care of the environment," he said.
</P>
<P>
The NEMC chairman said history showed that countries which
attained faster economic growth were those which were seriously
engaged in environmental conservation.
</P>
<P>
He mentioned unsustainable deforestation, improper land use,
improper disposal of industrial, hospital or domestic wastes, careless
use of insecticides and pestiicides and mining as some of the
activities which cause environmental degradation and pollution.
</P>
<P>
Mengi said environmental problems had serious impacts on the
lives of living things including the people.
</P>
<P>
He said the government had been taking various measures
to combat the problem including preparation of the environmental
policy and introduction of the environmental impact assessment unit.
</P>
<P>
During the workshop, Mengi presented certificates of
appreciation to Jitegemee Secondary School, Knoike Construction
Company, University of Dar es Sallam, Journalist Environmental
Association of Tanzania for their contribution in conserving and
protecting the environment. enditem

<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, June 5 (Xinhua) -- German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel
today called for strengthened ties between Europe and the Unites
States in a speech marking the 50th anniversary of the Marshall
Plan that had helped rebuild the post-war Europe.
</P>
<P>
"The reconstruction of the European house must be in step with
the strengthening of the trans-Atlantic bridge," said Kinkel at
the celebration ceremony in Bonn.
</P>
<P>
Kinkel said concerns over a steady erosion of the US-Europe
partnership had to be taken seriously. "For Europeans, there is
only one way to maintain the US interest in Europe. It means major
changes... to make it a competitive and decision-making player and
partner of America on the world stage," he added.
</P>
<P>
He also said that it could not be left to the Unites States to
solve problems for Europeans.
</P>
<P>
Attending the ceremony were also German President Roman Herzog,
Vice President of the EU Commission Sir Leon Brittan and
diplomats.
</P>
<P>
Former US Secretary of State George Marshall initiated the
reconstruction plan for Europe after World War II.
</P>
<P>
German Economics Minister Guenter Rexrodt earlier said the
Marshall Plan economic aid of 1.5 billion US dollars granted to
post-war Germany helped integrate Germany into the Western
community.

<HEADLINE> Poll Indicates Irish Opposition Likely to Win Election </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 5 (Xinhua) -- The voters in the Republic of
Ireland will cast their ballots in the general election to be held
Friday and the latest opinion poll indicated the opposition
coalition is likely to win the election.
</P>
<P>
The survey in today's Irish Independent newspaper showed that
the center-right opposition alliance, including the country's
largest political Fianna Fail party and the Progressive Democrats,
gained support of 49 percent, nine points ahead of the ruling
coalition.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister John Bruton's three-party ruling alliance, which
is consistently trailing the opposition in the three-week election
campaign, is battling to win over the 14 percent of voters who are
still undecided over their choice in a last-ditch effort to turn
the tables.
</P>
<P>
The survey also revealed that although 53 percent of those
polled expressed satisfaction over the current coalition
government, they still wanted to have a change of government.
</P>
<P>
"The poll underlines a startling reality -- a successful
government well regarded by more than half of voters stares defeat
in the face," an analyst said.

<HEADLINE> Ex-CIA Spy Sentenced to 23 Years in Jail in US </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 5 (Xinhua) -- U.S. double-spy Harold Nicholson
was sentenced today in Alexandria, Virginia, to 23 years and seven
months imprisonment for selling classified information to Russia.
</P>
<P>
On March 3, Nicholson, 46, pleaded guilty to conspiracy to
commit espionage by selling the names and positions of a large
number of U.S. intelligence officers to Moscow.
</P>
<P>
"I won't ask for the forgiveness of my colleagues and
countrymen for I know they cannot give it," Nicholson said before
the sentencing today.
</P>
<P>
He served as the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) station
chief in Romania from 1990 to 1992 before becoming deputy chief of
station and operations in Malaysia. From 1994 to 1996, Nicholson
served as a trainer for CIA recruits.
</P>
<P>
Nicholson confessed to having started spying for Moscow in June
1994 and admitted collecting 300,000 U.S. dollars from the
Russians.
</P>
<P>
In November 1996, Nicholson was arrested at Dulles
International Airport near Washington when he was carrying film
and a computer of classified information to pass on the Russian
agents in Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors said that Nicholson has "fully cooperated" and
"substantially" helped the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI)
and CIA in the investigation.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, they said, 23 years and seven months imprisonment is
"a sufficient and appropriate punishment" for his crime.

<HEADLINE> ECOMOG Chief Sees No Need to Evacuate Nigerians </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, June 5 (Xinhua) -- ECOMOG Force Commander Major-General
Victor Malu said here today that there was no need to panic over
the non-evacuation of Nigerians in Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
The situation had not come to that, said Malu who arrived from
the Liberian capital Monrovia to confer with General Sani Abacha,
Nigeria's head of state and chairman of the Economic Community of
West African States.
</P>
<P>
According to him, the rebel leader in Sierra Leone was very
much aware of what the Nigeria-led ECOMOG troops could do and that
was why he called for a ceasefire.
</P>
<P>
Malu was referring to Major Johnny Koromah, chairman of the
ruling Armed Forces Revolutionary Council set up by soldiers
after the coup on May 25 that toppled Sierra Leone's elected
government led by President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah.
</P>
<P>
Major Koromah has called for a ceasefire under the military
intervention of ECOMOG and political pressure from the
international community for the restoration of Kabbah's
government.

<P>
However, Malu said that ECOMOG's planned operation to flush
out the soldiers had not started.
</P>
<P>
"We had some skirmishes which we undertook just to protect
ourselves," he said, quoted by the News Agency of Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
"We were fired upon and we had to return fire and in the
course of that we sustained some casualties," he added.
</P>
<P>
He noted that ECOMOG's strong stance and mandate in the
operation had convinced the rebels of its resolve to sort out
issues militarily if it became necessary.
</P>
<P>
On the movement of troops from Liberia to Sierra Leone, Malu
said: "I can't afford to substantially deploy my men to Sierra
Leone, very few and essential few have been moved to Sierra
Leone."
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian military has said earlier that some ECOMOG troops
had been sent from Liberia to Sierra Leone but it would not
create loopholes in Liberia.

<HEADLINE> Egypt: Jerusalem Issue Open to Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, June 5 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa
today reaffirmed that the Jerusalem issue should be settled in
the Palestinian-Israeli final talks in line with signed
agreements.
</P>
<P>
Moussa made the statement when commenting on a peace plan
presented Wednesday by Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu
for a final settlement with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
"It has been agreed that the issue of Jerusalem is negotiable,
but any talks on this holy city by any party, if clashing with
signed agreements and relevant UN resolutions, will adversely
affect the final phase peace talks," Moussa said.
</P>
<P>
The plan Netanyahu presented to the inner cabinet for
discussions envisioned retaining Israeli control over the
strategic borders, Greater Jerusalem, settlements, water
resources and key roads in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
The status of Jerusalem, a focus in the current peace crisis,
has been agreed to be kept intact until the talks on a final
Palestinian-Israeli peace deal.
</P>
<P>
"Egypt's stand on the issue is clear, firm and unchanged," said
Moussa, who warned that any attempt to temper with Jerusalem's
current features will be detrimental to the final negotiations
that are yet to resume.
</P>
<P>
"Negotiation is a must on the status of Al Quds (Jerusalem)
and any current procedures in the city shall not have to create
any status quo that clashes with international legitimacy and
renders inevitable negotiations on it meaningless," he added.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian-Israeli peace talks have deadlocked since
March when Israel began the construction of a new Jewish
settlement on disputed land in Arab East Jerusalem despite
international outcry.
</P>
<P>
Moussa said it was to early to speak of any expected
breakthrough in reviving the paralyzed peace process.
</P>
<P>
He was critical of Netanyahu's plan, which he branded as
extremely harmful to any initiative or any action to settle
problems in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian National Authority (PNA) hopes to establish an
independent state as East Jerusalem as its capital in the final
arrangements.
</P>
<P>
The current hardline Israeli government has ruled out the
redivision of Jerusalem and existence of a Palestinian state
alongside Israel.
</P>
<P>
The PNA President Yasser Arafat has denounced the plan as
violating the Israeli-Palestinian peace agreements and dealing
another blow to Mideast peace.

<HEADLINE> Amnesty International Urged to Respect Kenya's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, June 5 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan Vice-President George
Saitoti today expressed the hope that Amnesty International would
in the future "be sensitive to Kenya's national sovereignty".
</P>
<P>
He noted that his government would not succumb to
"recommendations which question Kenya's national sovereignty or
are couched in the peremptory and prescriptive terms which are
usually employed in master-servant relationship."
</P>
<P>
In response to a memorandum by Amnesty International on human
rights situation in Kenya, the Kenyan leader told the visiting
Amnesty International delegation led by Secretary General Pierre
Sane that his government appreciated constructive criticism made
in good faith.
</P>
<P>
The concerns raised in the memorandum cover a range of issues
including constitutional reform, ordinary legislative reform and
executive administration of laws.
</P>
<P>
Saitoti, who is also Minister of Planning and National
Development, highlighted his government's commitment to upholding
the doctrine of separation of powers, and termed as "fiction" of
alleged executive interference of judiciary.
</P>
<P>
He underlined the independence of Kenya's judiciary, adding
that a legal notice had been promulgated delinking the judiciary
from the executive.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the constitutional reforms, the vice-president
said that after the general elections this year, a commission
would be appointed to review the Kenya constitution.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the government had appointed a task force
to review public order and security laws including the
preservation of public security act, the administration police
act and the societies act.
</P>
<P>
The Kenyan government also appointed another task force to
review the penal laws and procedure and both task forces are at
work, he added.
</P>
<P>
The Kenyan leader said that President Daniel arap Moi pledged
on June 1 that the public order act would be replaced by a
peaceful assemblies act which would liberalize the exercise of
the freedom of assembly.

<HEADLINE> Computer Printer Sales to Slow Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, June 5 (Xinhua) -- The market for computer printers
is slowing despite of aggressive price cuts by major printer
makers.
</P>
<P>
In the consumer market, unit sales are expected to rise 15
percent in 1997 as against 31 percent last year, according to
Dataquest, a major market researcher of the U.S.
</P>
<P>
Revenue will be up 8 percent as against 16 percent a year ago.
In the corporate market, unit sales are expected to dip slightly,
while revenue will decline 13 percent, compared to last year's
standard.
</P>
<P>
A price war that began a year ago brought down prices for
printers in the home market to a record low. Some printers, often
older models, are offered free with selected personal computer
purchases.
</P>
<P>
Some dealers said it is hard to make money as people are not
buying printers as often.
</P>
<P>
So to lure buyers back to the market, companies are upgrading
printer speed and color quality and adding more paper-handling
features. Top printer companies launch new products every six
months, according to market researchers.
</P>
<P>
But researchers also noted that the PC market demand for
ink-jet printers is growing steadily, while laser printers show
sluggishness. The world's sales of ink-jet printers last year grew
to 9.5 million units from 7.2 million units in 1995. Researchers
estimated that the sales for this will climb to 10.9 million.
</P>
<P>
But sales of laser printers will remain flat to 2.8 million
units this year.

<HEADLINE> Jordan Supports Palestinians Back to Their Homeland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, June 5 (Xinhua) -- King Hussein of Jordan said today
that the Palestinians in Jordan should finally settle down on
their own national soil.
</P>
<P>
During his visit to the Mu'ta area in southern Jordan, Hussein
stated that Jordan always supports the Palestinians to return to
their homeland in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
Earlier last month, the King said in a speech that Jordan
would not be a substitute homeland for Palestinians and would not
tolerate any attempt to undermine Jordan's national unity.
</P>
<P>
His speech was directing against a 700-million U.S. dollars
plan by the United States Jewish society, under which the
Palestinian refugees should be permanently settled down in Jordan.
</P>
<P>
Jordan annually allocates some 300 million dollars for the
Palestinian refugees who came to Jordan after Israel annexed part
of their homeland in 1948 during the first Middle East war.
</P>
<P>
About one-fourth of Jordan's 4 million-strong population are
Palestinian refugees.

<HEADLINE> First M-8 Group Summit Due in Istanbul in Mid-June </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, June 5 (Xinhua) -- Eight Muslim countries (M-8) are to
hold their first summit meeting in the Turkish largest city,
Istanbul on June 15 to seek cooperation among them.
</P>
<P>
A statement by the Turkish Foreign Ministry said that before
the summit, foreign ministers of Turkey, Iran, Egypt, Indonesia,
Pakistan, Nigeria, Malaysia and Bangladesh will hold a council
meeting on June 14 and high-ranking officials from the M-8 Group
will convene a two-day commission meeting.
</P>
<P>
Turkish President Suleyman Demirel and Prime Minister
Necmettin Erbakan are expected to attend the summit, said the
statement.
</P>
<P>
Erbakan, enthusiastic initiator of the group, said earlier
that at the summit some important principles for the organization
will be stipulated in a bid to expand cooperation among the
member states.
</P>
<P>
During the summit, more than 50 cooperation projects among the
Muslim countries will be discussed, and the planned projects
cover various fields as trade, industry and telecommunications,
added the Turkish premier.
</P>
<P>
The M-8 Group, first proposed by Erbakan, was formed late last
year.
</P>
<P>
The Muslim bloc, which is aimed at boosting the multilateral
cooperation among the eight states, held its first foreign
ministers' meeting in Turkey in 1996 and decided to establish
its general secretariat in Istanbul.
</P>
<P>
The formation of the M-8 Group has provoked dissatisfaction
from the United States and European countries. They believe that
the group is directed against the Group-7 bloc that comprises the
U.S., Britain, France, Japan, Australia, Germany and Canada.

<HEADLINE> Tourists Not Have to Worry About Water in Cyprus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, June 5 (Xinhua) -- Holiday makers to this eastern
Mediterranean island don't have to worry about water during the
coming summer as local authorities are taking every possible
measure to ensure amply water supply to tourist areas.
</P>
<P>
Georgios Socratous, an official with the Water Development
Department, today promised that water supply to tourists in this
peak season will remain "uninterrupted and plentiful."
</P>
<P>
The sun-drenched island is actually suffering from water
shortage as water in the dams on the island takes up only 23
percent of their total capacity, falling by half from the level
last year.
</P>
<P>
To irrigate the island's booming tourism industry, local
authorities are exercising water supply cuts to the residents and
at the same time encourage water conservation.
</P>
<P>
Socratous told reporters today that his Department has reduced
water supply to cities across the island by 20 percent, for
agricultural purposes by 75 percent and for private gardening by
15 percent.
</P>
<P>
These have been coupled with an island-wide campaign to urge
citizens to "do their part in conserving the island's most
precious resource."
</P>
<P>
The government also gives incentives to homeowners to drill for
water on their property and connect newly-found supply to their
bathroom installations.
</P>
<P>
This, Socratous said, would provide up to 30 percent of each
household's total water consumption.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the island's first desalination plant which has been
operation since March will play an important role in serving the
southeastern tourist center of Ayia Napa as well as parts of the
southern coastal town of Larnaca.
</P>
<P>
A second desalination plant is expected to be completed in 1999
to serve the island's other tourist areas as well as the capital
Nicosia.
</P>
<P>
On their part, almost all hotels have installed water
reservation water tanks to guarantee their guests with 24-hour
supply of potable water.
</P>
<P>
Summer is the peak season for foreign tourists. Last year the
island attracted about 2 million visitors, bring about some 1.6
billion U.S. dollars in foreign currency earnings.

<HEADLINE> Kissinger Says Necessary to Renew MFN to China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 5 (Xinhua) -- Henry Kissinger, former
secretary of state said on Thursday that revocation of the Most
Favored nation (MFN) trade status to China could only backfire and
do harm to the relations between the United States and China.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a Senate committee, Kissinger said he did not
believe that denial of MFN was the way for U.S. approach to china.
Rather, "we should give cooperative relations a chance," he said.
</P>
<P>
The secretary of state of the Nixon administration, who took
the initiative in early 1970s to thaw the relations between the
United States and China, said any challenge to the extension of
China's MFN status would do more damage to the United States "in
every corner of the war."
</P>
<P>
"Every Asian country will have to choose" between China and the
United States, "and they will blame us for having to be put in
that position," he added.
</P>
<P>
The MFN status is virtually the normal trade treatment which
the United States gives to most countries in the world.
</P>
<P>
President Bill Clinton announced to renew the MFN status to
China on May 19.

<HEADLINE> Singapore Calls For Wider Cooperation with Malaysia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, June 6 (Xinhua) -- Singapore has called for wider
cooperation with Malaysia in an attempt to improve strained
bilateral ties, the Straits Times reported today.
</P>
<P>
The English newspaper quoted Singapore Prime Minister Goh Chok
Tong as saying that the two neighboring countries should discard
old historical and emotional baggage and embark on a new era of
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Giving a 50-minute speech in parliament Thursday, Goh offered a
framework of wider cooperation between the two countries which
would help overcome existing difficulties in their relationship.
</P>
<P>
The recent dispute between Singapore and Malaysia was sparked
by a court statement by Singaporean Senior Minister Lee Kuan Yew,
which refers to Johor, a state in southern Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
The Malaysian government decided on March 26, 1997 to
temporarily freeze its ties with Singapore and postpone all the
ongoing bilateral talks.
</P>
<P>
Despite Lee made a public apology for his statement, the
Malaysian government said that bilateral ties could not be
improved in a short period of time.
</P>
<P>
Goh hoped that Singapore and Malaysia would continue their
talks over mutually beneficial projects, such as a high-speed
electric rail link between the two countries and a long-term water
supply deal from Malaysia to Singapore.
</P>
<P>
Singapore relies heavily on water from Malaysia and the two
agreements on water supply will expire in 2010 and 2060.
</P>
<P>
Goh said in his speech that he had explained to his Malaysian
counterpart Mahathir Mohamad that Singapore sought a water
agreement within a wider framework of cooperation.
</P>
<P>
"If Singapore and Malaysia can embark on a new era of
cooperation, we will signal to the present and future generations
that we have discarded the old historical and emotional baggage in
favor of fruitful, mutually beneficial cooperation ," he said.

<HEADLINE> 27 Countries, Regions Grant HKSAR Passport Holders Visa-Free Access </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 6 (Xinhua) -- A total of 27 countries and
regions in the world have so far agreed or announced to grant
holders of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR)
passport visa-free access, the chief of Hong Kong's Immigration
Department announced here today.
</P>
<P>
Director of Immigration Regina Ip Lau Suk-yee said 17 countries
and regions have announced their decisions on visa-free access for
SAR passport holders and her department has been informed by the
Chinese Foreign Ministry that 10 more countries and regions have
also decided to do so.
</P>
<P>
And three other countries -- the United States, Australia and
Japan -- have announced that SAR passport holders will be given
the same treatment as British Nationals Overseas or BN(O) passport
holders.
</P>
<P>
The immigration chief also said distribution of SAR passport
application forms will begin on June 10 this year and the forms
will be available at Hong Kong's immigration offices, district
offices and major post offices.
</P>
<P>
Some 5.5 million of Hong Kong's residents are eligible for SAR
passports, according to the director.
</P>
<P>
Application forms will also be obtainable in foreign countries
from all Chinese embassies and consulates-general within one week
or two, she said.
</P>
<P>
Under the Basic Law, Chinese citizens who hold Hong Kong
permanent identity cards will be eligible to apply for the HKSAR
passport. In short, persons of Chinese descent who hold, or are
qualified to hold, BN(O) passports or Hong Kong Certificates of
Identity (CIs), will be eligible as long as they remain Chinese
citizens.
</P>
<P>
If an applicant holds a valid BN(O) passport, he does not need
to give it up when the SAR passport is issued to him. He can
retain both passports and choose to travel on whichever passport
he likes, Ip said. However, if an applicant holds a valid Hong
Kong CI, he will have to surrender it for cancellation upon the
issue of the SAR passport.
</P>
<P>
No Hong Kong CIs will be issued or renewed after June 30, 1997,
because the CI holders will be eligible for SAR passports.
However, the CIs, which are valid beyond June 30, 1997, can
continue to be used until their normal expiry dates.
</P>
<P>
Of the more than 5 million Hong Kong residents, some 3 million
hold BN(O) passports and they can travel after July 1 this year
with their BN(O) passports first, Ip said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, most of the more 1.3 million Hong Kong CI holders
can travel with the CIs after July 1 this year as their CIs will
remain valid sometime after the handover.
</P>
<P>
As there is no deadline for the SAR passport application, it's
up to the Hong Kong residents themselves to decide when to apply
for the SAR passport, Ip continued.
</P>
<P>
SAR passport applications will be processed on a
"first-come-first-served" basis. But priority will be given to
applicants who have no travel documents or whose travel documents
will expire within 12 months, the immigration chief said.
</P>
<P>
Ip predicted that Hong Kong CI holders would be eager to apply
for SAR passports, which, she said, are more convenient as their
holders can enjoy visa-free access to at least 27 countries and
regions, against just two for the Hong Kong CI holders now.
</P>
<P>
The normal processing time for an SAR passport application is
15 working days. With a working staff of some 30, the Immigration
Department will be able to issue some 2,000 SAR passports daily
from July 3 on. The daily figure could be increased to 4,000 if
the department has more manpower in the future, according to the
Ip.

<HEADLINE> English Speech Contest For Hong Kong Return </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 6 (Xinhua) -- An English-language speech contest
for eleven students from eleven universities was held in Beijing
today to celebrate the return of Hong Kong to the motherland.
</P>
<P>
Fu Xiyong, a student from Shanghai's Fudan University, won
first place in the contest for students from Beijing, Shanghai,
Guangdong Province, and Hong Kong. Vice-Premier Li Lanqing, who
gave a speech in English at the opening of the contest, gave the
award to Fu.
</P>
<P>
Lam Tak Wing, a student at Beijing University of Languages and
Culture, and Wan Sai Man, of Qinghua University, won excellence
awards.
</P>
<P>
The contest was based on several English speech contests given
in Beijing, Shanghai, and Guangdong starting in April. Zhang
Xiaowen, vice-minister in charge of the State Education Commission
(SEC), the contest's sponsor, said that the contest was designed
to help young students express their patriotism and greetings
for Hong Kong's return.
</P>
<P>
Hu Wenzhong, chairman of the judges panel, said that the
contest was "a high-level English speech contest" and that "we
could not help being moved by many of them."
</P>
<P>
Hu, a well-known English language professor, encouraged
all contestants by saying that, although they were all speaking on
the same topic, they succeeded in impressing the audience with
different stories in different ways.
</P>
<P>
He pointed to a "welcome change" where non-English majors
competed with English majors on the same stage.
</P>
<P>
Among the audience were officials for the SEC, the Hong Kong
and Macao Affairs Office of the State Council, the Ministry of
Foreign Affairs, and students from Beijing-based
universities.

a transit route to Bangladesh on a trial basis, the Nepali Foreign
Ministry said here today.
</P>
<P>
During his meeting with Nepali Foreign Minister Prakash Chandra
Lohani today, visiting Indian Prime Minister I. K. Gujral agreed

At the meeting, the Nepali foreign minister emphasized that the
transit route is not only for Nepal's economic development but
also for creating an atmosphere of confidence between the two
neighboring countries and realizing the concept of sub-regional
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Nepal has been asking India to provide the Phulbari overland
corridor for its products to be shipped to Bangladeshi ports, thus
significantly cutting the transportation cost of its exports.
</P>
<P>
Currently most of Nepal's exports and imports are shipped
through the Indian port of Calcutta.

<HEADLINE> Canada's Jobless Rate Down Slightly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, June 6 (Xinhua) -- Canada's unemployment rate edged
down 0.1 percentage points in May to 9.5 percent despite strong
job gains.
</P>
<P>
Statistics Canada reported today that employment in May rose by
an estimated 61,000, the third consecutive monthly increase,
bringing gains since February to 156,000.
</P>
<P>
In May, the labor force expanded by 51,000, which partly offset
the strong job gains.
</P>
<P>
Employment continued to rise in the private sector. In May, an
estimated 52,000 more people were working in the private sector.
</P>
<P>
Little change has been recorded in the public sector for almost
a year, the federal agency said.
</P>
<P>
In May, employment in community, business and personal services
rose by 76,000, bringing gains since September 1996 to 232,000.
</P>
<P>
Employment in the goods sector changed little. In construction,
employment declined by 14,000.
</P>
<P>
In other primary industries, employment was up 8,000, partially
offsetting losses of 12,000 jobs over the previous three months.
Employment in manufacturing held steady for the second consecutive
month following a strong gain in March.
</P>
<P>
"Two-thirds of the increase in May was in Ontario (province)
where employment rose by 41,000, bringing the gains in the past
three months to 101,000," the agency said.

<P>
BONN, June 5 (Xinhua) -- The number of unemployed people in
Germany fell by 91,200 to 4.23 million in May over April, a rate
of 11.1 percent, but was still 430,000 higher than a year earlier,
the Federal Labour Office said today.
</P>
<P>
The office said joblessness remained at a post-war record high,
and stripping out seasonal factors, dole queues lengthened by
56,000 to almost 4.36 million.
</P>
<P>
Office chief Bernhard Jagoda stressed that the German economy
was still not strong enough to reverse the unfavorable trends on
the job market.
</P>
<P>
Jagoda also warned that Germany's average unemployment this
year would reach 4.2 million, exceeding the 3.95 million projected
by the federal government.
</P>
<P>
High unemployment is pushing up Germany's social security
spending, making it more difficult for Bonn to cut the budget
deficit below three percent of gross domestic product (GDP), as
required by the Maastricht Treaty for European Union countries
wanting to join the single currency, the Euro.

LONDON, June 6 (Xinhua) -- New car registrations in Britain
rose by 2.5 percent to 169,886 in May over the same month last
year, figures released by the Society of Motor Manufacturers and
Traders (SMMT) show.
</P>
<P>
The figures showed new car sales in the first five months of
this year went up by 4.9 percent to 902,167 over the same period
last year.
</P>
<P>
The data confirms that Britain is one of the most buoyant new
car markets in Europe but also a tough one, the society says.
</P>
<P>
SMMT said that imports made up 63.5 percent of May's
registrations compared with 61.5 percent a year ago. In the year
to date, imports have taken a 64.7 percent market share, compared
with 61.5 percent for the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
"A small reduction in fleet registrations was offset by a
modest improvement in the private retail sector. Overall,
registrations are holding up well with a year to date rise of 4.9
percent," said Roger King, SMMT Director of Public Affairs.
</P>
<P>
"Nevertheless, the modest growth in May shows the market
remains a tough one," he added.

The symposium was jointly sponsored by the Zhejiang Provincial
Youth Federation, the Provincial Department of Foreign Trade and
Economic Cooperation, the Provincial Tourism Administration, and
the Provincial Academy of Social Sciences.
</P>
<P>
About 40 scholars from the People's Bank of China, the
National Tourism Administration, and the State Planning Commission
attending it said that Zhejiang and Hong Kong have expanded their
economic and trade relations over the past few years.
</P>
<P>
There is still potential for economic cooperation between the

resources, products, markets, trade, investment, and tourism after
Hong Kong's return to the motherland.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong is Zhejiang's important trade partner and had set up
6,594 companies in Zhejiang by the end of 1996, with a total
investment of 8.8 billion US dollars, nearly 48 percent of the
total of overseas-funded projects and 53 percent of the
investment, respectively.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, Zhejiang has 2.46 billion US dollars worth of trade
with Hong Kong, and had 127,800 Hong Kong and Macao
tourists.

<HEADLINE> Algerian President's Party Wins Parliamentary Election </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ALGIERS, June 6 (Xinhua) -- Algeria's National Democratic Rally
(RND), founded four months ago and seen as a major supporter of
President Liamine Zeroual, won 155 seats in the country's
parliamentary election on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Together with the former ruling National Liberation Front
(FLN), which won 64 seats, the two parties formed the largest
force in the new 380-seat National People's Assembly, Algerian
Interior Minister Mostefa Benmansour said today.
</P>
<P>
Two Islam-leaning parties, the Movement of Society for Peace
and the Ennahda, won 69 and 34 seats respectively, forming the
second largest parliamentary force.
</P>
<P>
The Socialist Forces Front and the Rally for Culture and
Democracy both got 19 seats, while the leftist Workers Party won
only four seats.
</P>
<P>
Three smaller parties won five seats each, and independent
movements won 11 seats.
</P>
<P>
The new parliament is Algeria's first elected multi-party
assembly since independence in 1962. Algeria was run as a
one-party state by the FLN for nearly three decades until the
first attempt at a parliamentary vote in December 1991.
</P>
<P>
The election, which radical Islamists were poised to win, was
cancelled by the military-backed authorities in January 1992 and
shortly afterwards the country plunged into violence. An estimated
60,000 people have died in the troubles.

<TEXT>
<P>
MUNICH, Germany, June 6 (Xinhua) -- Chinese leader Li Ruihuan
today visited Germany's Daimler-Benz Aerospace AG (Dasa), the
aircraft and aerospace subsidiary of the Daimler-Benz group.
</P>
<P>
During his meeting with board members of the Daimler-Benz group
and Dasa at Dasa's headquarters, Li, chairman of the Chinese
People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), said that
China and the Daimler-Benz group have enjoyed a long history of
cooperation which has continued to expand in recent years.
</P>
<P>
He expressed satisfaction with cooperation between China and
Dasa in aviation, adding that he hopes the company will do better
in improving quality, security and services, which he said will
help build a more solid foundation for long-term cooperation
between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
Dietrich Russel, head of Dasa's Civil Aircraft and Helicopters
Unit, and Peter Fietzek, who is responsible for the Eastern
Hemisphere at Daimler-Benz AG, briefed the Chinese leader on Dasa
and its activities in China.
</P>
<P>
They stressed that China is an immensely important growth
market for all the business units of the Daimler-Benz group.
</P>
<P>
They said that Dasa has established 12 joint ventures in China
with the focus on aviation, satellite communications and solar
energy utilization.
</P>
<P>
Those ventures have grown smoothly and have achieved remarkable
results, they said, adding that they hope the mutually beneficial
cooperation will be further strengthened.
</P>
<P>
After the meeting, the Chinese leader also viewed some products
of Dasa, and watched the performance of an EC135 helicopter.
</P>
<P>
As a partner of the European Airbus Consortium, Dasa is
involved in the construction of all Airbus aircraft purchased by
China.
</P>
<P>
In May, China ordered 35 new Airbus aircraft of the A320
family, raising the total number of the aircraft ordered by China
to 60.
</P>
<P>
As an Airbus partner, Dasa is also involved in an
Asian-European project to build a 100-seater passenger aircraft. A
framework agreement on the project was reached in May.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the company is also cooperating with China, Singapore
and France in building a light helicopter, EC120.

<HEADLINE> Iran Terms Deadline Set by Taliban as "Illegal" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, June 6 (Xinhua) -- A senior Iranian official today
termed the deadline set by the Taliban for Iranian diplomats to
leave Kabul, the capital of Afghanistan, as "totally illegal and
not in accord with any international law."
</P>
<P>
Iranian Judicial Chief Mohammad Yazadi made the statement
while addressing multitudes of worshipers gathered at the
Mausoleum of late spiritual leader Khomeini in southern Tehran,
the capital of Iran, the official news agency IRNA reported.
</P>
<P>
However, IRNA gave no details about the deadline.
</P>
<P>
Yazadi said that Afghanistan's situation was not yet clear and
Iranian officials hope to witness unification of the Jihadi
groups and resolution of their problems through negotiations.
</P>
<P>
IRNA also reported that Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister
Allaeddin Boroujerdi arrived in Afghanistan's Mazar-i-Sharif
today at the invitation of the United Islamic Front of
Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
Boroujerdi said that recent developments in Afghanistan proved
futility of military solution for settlement of the Afghan
crisis, stressing the necessity of solving the intricacies of the
situation through negotiations and mutual understanding.
</P>
<P>
He added that Afghan nation was made up of different tribes,
whose contribution to the political sovereignty of their country
was the only way out of the traditional dispute.
</P>
<P>
He expressed hope that all Afghan tribes should strive for
restoration of peace and calm in their homeland in a sound
atmosphere and for reaching mutual understanding through
formation of an Islamic government. He also hoped that
Afghanistan's neighbors play positive roles in that direction.

<HEADLINE> Former Senior Official Sentenced to Five Years For Bribery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 6 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese Communist Party Central
Commission For Discipline Inspection issued a circular today,
calling on leaders at all levels to learn a lesson from the
downfall of a senior official of Hainan Province and to be clean
and true Communist Party members.
</P>
<P>
Wei Zefang, former vice-chairman of the Standing Committee of
the Hainan Provincial People's Congress, was sentenced by the
Provincial Higher People's Court to five years in prison and
expelled from the Communist Party for accepting 60,000 yuan in
bribes while serving as the secretary of the Provincial Political
and Legal Committee. He was also accused of tampering with an
investigation of the businessmen who was accused of bribing him.
</P>
<P>
Wei was a communist member for 39 years and has 47 years of
work experience.
</P>
<P>
"He has done some good things for the Party and the people
during his long period of revolutionary work," the circular said,
"but, in the late years, he failed to preserve his integrity, and
accepted bribes and covered up for criminals, and ended up as a
prisoner himself."
</P>
<P>
"The lesson is a profound one and one that cadres at all levels
must draw on," it said.

<HEADLINE> EU to Simplify Telecoms Terminal Equipment Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, June 6 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission, the
European Union (EU)'s executive body, is aiming to simplify the
marketing of telecommunications terminal equipment in all its
member states, it was learned here today.
</P>
<P>
Following a proposal from Martin Bangemann, EU commissioner for
telecommunication policies, the EC today adopted a directive aimed
at stipulating a new framework to support the market for
telecommunications terminals.
</P>
<P>
The proposal meets the changing needs of the telecommunications
market caused by the explosive growth of mobile services and the
prospect of full liberalization of the supply of
telecommunications networks and services from January 1998.
</P>
<P>
When implemented, the new framework will speed up the time
taken to bring new equipment onto the market and will extend the
single European market to all types of radio and wire-based
telecommunications terminals.
</P>
<P>
The proposed framework is a fast and flexible one which relies
on self-certification by industry, rather than cumbersome testing
by outside bodies.

<HEADLINE> Importation of Sugar Needed in Philippines: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 6 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines needs to import some
300,000 to 350,000 tons of sugar during the next crop season to
fill in a projected supply shortfall, a senior sugar official said
today.
</P>
<P>
Sugar Regulatory Administrator Wilson Gamboa said a plan for
sugar importation will be taken up by the Sugar Regulatory
Administration Board later this month and then submitted to
President Fidel Ramos for approval.
</P>
<P>
The planned sugar imports for the 1997-98 crop year are vital
in the buildup of security reserve which shall not go down below a
two-month supply of sugar, Gamboa said.
</P>
<P>
The Philippines keeps a strategic sugar reserve of 350,000 to
400,000 tons in order to meet the increasing local consumption of
sugar, according to Gamboa.
</P>
<P>
Placing the annual growth rate of the country's sugar
consumption at 4.5 percent, Gamboa predicted the local sugar
consumption shall reach 2.1 million tons in the next sugar crop
year.
</P>
<P>
But the production level, on the other hand, is seen to reach
some 1.8 million tons, thus resulting in a shortfall of around
300,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
The Philippines will start importing sugar in September 1997 or
in March 1998, according to Gamboa.

<HEADLINE> China, Portugal Prepare to Build Macao-Zhuhai Bridge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, June 6 (Xinhua) -- An informal working panel was
established here today to make detailed preparations for the
construction of a bridge linking Macao and neighboring Zhuhai in
south China's Guangdong province, officials announced.
</P>
<P>
Xie Houhe, head of the Chinese side of the Sino-Portuguese
Infrastructure Coordination Commission, which was established in
Beijing on April 30, made the announcement together with his
Portuguese counterpart Leonel Miranda after a closed-door meeting
this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The panel will start working soon to make geological survey and
other investigations so that a feasibility study report could be
submitted to the second plenary session of the commission, Xie
told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Chinese and Portuguese officials on the commission concluded
today a four-day survey on the possible site of the bridge in
Zhuhai and Macao. They have decided on the general location of the
 bridge.
</P>
<P>
The proposed bridge will run from a major Zhuhai island called
Hengqin and to a piece of reclamation land between Macao's two
islands -- Taipa and Coloane. It is designed to be 760 meters
long, 13 meters above water and have six lanes.
</P>
<P>
According to a report in a local newspaper, the bridge will
cost 95 million Hong Kong dollars (about 12.29 million U.S.
dollars). The cost will in principle be shared equally by
Zhuhai and Macao.
</P>
<P>
"It is the wish of many Macao residents and the wish of our
commission to complete the bridge before 1999," said Xie, who is
also chief of the Macao Division in the Hong Kong and Macao
Affairs Office of the State Council.

Fast-Growing Computer Market in Kenya
</P>
<P>
NAIROBI, June 6 (Xinhua) -- Thousands of enthusiastic Kenyans
swarmed into the sixth Africa Information Technology Exhibitions
and Conferences (AITEC) which is to end here later today, a symbol of
the fast-expanding computer market in Kenya and the continent.
</P>
<P>
The three-day AITEC, the largest since it started in Harare
in 1987, attracted 67 exhibitors this year with the most advanced
software, hardware, telecommunication systems and office
equipment displayed and more than 2,000 visitors coming in a day.
</P>
<P>
The AITEC was attended by 30 exhibitors with more than
7,000 visitors.
</P>
<P>
"It has been a resounding success... The outstanding feature
of the show, besides tremendous exposure of the internet, is the
atmosphere of friendship and cooperation between exhibitors and
visitors," said Sean Moroney, head organizer of AITEC.
</P>
<P>
"All exhibitors have been very pleased with quality of
visitors and many have reported positive sales results already,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
According to Kenya-based Africa Online, a premier internet
service provider in Africa with offices in Ghana, Cote D'Ivoire,
Tanzania, Uganda and Zimbabwe, their visitors are curious about
the new technological advancement and most of them are keen on
doing serious business.
</P>
<P>
"We have sold over 10 subscriptions already," said a
representative of the firm.
</P>
<P>
"There is a big potential of the computer market in both
Kenya and Africa," a manager from the Comtech System Limited
company, one of all the seven local dealers here for world-famous
Compaq, told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
"We are very optimism. The market here is very strong and
expands very fast," he said. His company sold 500 computer sets
in Kenya last year.
</P>
<P>
Computech, another local dealer of Compaq, sold some 1,000
computer sets in 1996. Compaq now holds more than 20 percent
share of the Kenyan computer market.
</P>
<P>
Now there are more than 300 information technology companies
in Kenya which holds 60 percent of the computer market in the
eastern African region partly as a result of the economic
liberalization in recent years.
</P>
<P>
Duties on imported computer-related products stand at
five percent, the lowest in east Africa, said an IBM officer at
the show.
</P>
<P>
Currently there are estimatedly 240,000 computer sets
operating in Kenya. The Internet users reached 5, 000 in Nairobi
with a total of 11 internet service providers.
</P>
<P>
The Kenyan government has introduced a number of specialized
courses such as computer science, information technology and
management information services in national polytechincs and
other technical training institutions in the country.
</P>
<P>
The computer companies participating at the show also include
Carl Bro, Gath Management, Abacus, Modern Business
Communications, Microsoft, Copycat, DEC and other giants in the
field.

<HEADLINE> Civil Service Exam Becoming Popular in China (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 6 (Xinhua) -- The idea of getting a government
job was just a distant dream for many Chinese, as recently as
three years ago, no matter how ambitious or competent they might
be, if they lacked the proper academic background, but things have
changed.
</P>
<P>
Now there is a simple and effective way for them to realize
their dreams, with an open exam system to choose civil servants
now being used in most of the country.
</P>
<P>
China decided to change its civil service system for both
central and local governments in 1993 and the following year the
Personnel Ministry formulated the "Provisional Regulation on the
Hiring of Civil Servants", which state that any government
employees who are not in leading positions must take part in the
open examination.
</P>
<P>
"The practice of choosing civil servants by an exam has helped
create a cleaner image of the government among the people and has
improved the general quality of civil servants," said Xu Songtao,
vice-minister of personnel.
</P>
<P>
Starting in 1994, the Personnel Ministry and the Organization
Department of the Chinese Communist Party Central Committee held
joint exams three times to recruit 1,722 civil servants and other
workers for central government departments.
</P>
<P>
During the same period, 28 provinces, autonomous regions and
municipalities have recruited nearly 19,000 civil servants for
various provincial departments through the same process.
</P>
<P>
The three open exams attracted more than 48,000 applicants,
while over 210,000 people across the country joined the contest at
the provincial level.
</P>
<P>
"The exam system has received a warm welcome from the general
public because it reflects the principle of openness, fairness,
competition and choosing the best," Xu noted.

<HEADLINE> Civil Service Exam Becoming Popular in China (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The new system is popular, he added, because many units
have recruited civil servants regardless of where they are from or
what their social status is, based completely on their competence.
</P>
<P>
In 1994, the Railways Ministry and the National Bureau of
Oceanography took the lead in recruiting civil servants from all
over China, instead of from the capital city alone.
</P>
<P>
The Communications Ministry, the State Education Commission,
and other central government departments followed suit, so
did provinces and municipalities like Hainan, Hebei and Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, a number of provinces and cities, like Fujian,
Gansu, Jilin and Xi'an, have even allowed local farmers to compete
for government posts.
</P>
<P>
Wang Limin, a young farmer from Yongji County in Jilin
Province, became a worker at the County Procuratorate in 1995
after successfully taking a provincial exam for civil servants at
the county level.
</P>
<P>
"The new system has provided everyone, including farmers like
us, with a chance to engage in fair competition," he exclaimed.
</P>
<P>
The Personnel Ministry's next goal is to set up a complete exam
system for central authorities and for governments at the
township, county, prefectural and provincial levels, the
vice-minister said.
</P>
<P>
"We will strive to introduce a complete, standardized, and
modern system for selecting civil servants in China by exams by
the end of this century," he added.

<HEADLINE> China's Worst Fire-Damaged Forest Area Restored </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, Jane 6 (Xinhua) -- In a decade since China's worst
forest fire raged through Greater Hinggan Mountains Forest in
Heilongjiang Province in the northeast, thousands of hectares of
new trees have been planted to help ease the painful memories left
by the blaze.
</P>
<P>
According to a source from the Ministry of Forestry, 92.4
percent of the total one million hectares of fire-damaged area in
the Greater Hinggan Mountains have been re-forested, which has
significantly controlled the balance of ecological environment
there.
</P>
<P>
"Now most of the area is now dotted with pine trees and natural
second growth trees, with a background of burnt tree stumps as a
grim reminder of what happened," a source from the Ministry said.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Forestry Xu Youfang said that there is no precedent
in the world for the restoration of forest resources on a such
large scale in such a cold and high-latitude area like that of
the Greater Hinggan Mountains.
</P>
<P>
Soon after the 1987 fire, the relevant departments of both the
central and local governments launched a forest restoration
project, he said. To date, a total of 710 million yuan (85.5
million US dollars) has been invested to the project through
various channels.
</P>
<P>
Over the past ten years, the yearly average forest area planted
in the Greater Hinggan Mountain was more than 20,000 hectares, 75
times more than before the fire.
</P>
<P>
Around 1,000 researchers and technicians from eight research
institutes and universities across China have participated in the
forest restoration project.
</P>
<P>
The Greater Hinggan Mountain region is one of the country's
richest bases for primeval timber and forestry products. It also
plays an vital role in maintaining the ecological environment and
promoting sustained economic development in northeast China.

years after 2000 by promising job stability and major future
investment.
</P>
<P>
Leading car and component manufacturers unanimously expressed
their welcome to the government decision to keep tariffs at 15
percent until the year 2005.
</P>
<P>
Australia's car tariffs, currently standing at 22.5 percent,
will fall by 2.5 percent a year until they reach 15 percent in
2000.
</P>
<P>
The decision was announced by Prime Minister John Howard
Thursday night following several days of intense negotiations with
state premiers and chief executives of the four car makers --
Ford, General-Motors Holden, Toyota and Mitsubishi.
</P>
<P>
The government's Industry Commission recommended last month
that car tariffs be phased down from 15 percent to 5 percent
between 2000 and 2004.
</P>
<P>
Ford Australia said the decision has ensured that Australia
remains a competitive location for auto investment.
</P>
<P>
Ford Australia President David Morgan was quoted by the
Australian Associated Press as saying the decision has also
secured jobs for 7,000 Ford employees and given the company the
potential to invest in further export programs. More than 45,000
people are employed in the industry.
</P>
<P>
Mitsubishi Motors Australia Ltd. said it is now confident of
securing a 450 million Australian dollar investment in its
Adelaide manufacturing plant following the tariff decision.
</P>
<P>
"Our next investment needs to be decided by the end of 1998 and
it will be a number somewhere between 400 million Australian
dollars and 450 million Australian dollars," Managing Director
Mike Quinn said.
</P>
<P>
Toyota and Mitsubishi last month urged the Australian
government not to endorse a radical car tariff reduction proposal
by the official Industry Commission, or they would reconsider
their investment plans in Australia.
</P>
<P>
Holden Managing Director Jim Wiemels said the tariff decision
has given Holden the confidence it needs to increase its
investments in the country.
</P>
<P>
Wiemels said the outcome has also laid the foundation for
Holden and other car manufacturers to become major manufacturers
within the Asia Pacific region.
</P>
<P>
The Federation of Automotive Products Manufacturers, which
represents more than 200 component manufacturers, said the tariff
decision would help boost component exports.

The grouping is aimed at creating an environment for rapid
economic development through identification and implementation of
specific cooperation projects in the sectors of trade, investment,
industry, technology, human resource development, tourism,
agriculture, energy, infrastructure and transportation.

help Thailand expand its markets in its neighboring nations to its
west.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Vice-Premier Meets Italian Prime Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 6 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-Premier Zhu Rongji
said today that China and Italy can raise bilateral friendly
relations of cooperation to a new level by further expanding their
cooperative fields, means and forms in the '90s, following their
efforts in the effective cooperation of the '80s.
</P>
<P>
Zhu made the remark in a meeting here this morning with
visiting Italian Prime Minister Romano Prodi.
</P>
<P>
He also said that Prodi, a well-known economist and an old
friend of China, has visited China several times and made positive
contributions to the development of bilateral friendship and
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Zhu said he is convinced that Prodi's current visit will
further enhance mutual understanding and trust, and will help to
increase bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
Recalling his last two visits to Italy, he said that Italy's
brilliant culture and arts, and economic achievements have left a
profound impression on him.
</P>
<P>
Noting that both China and Italy have ancient civilizations and
the two peoples have a long history of traditional friendship, Zhu
said that Sino-Italian relations in various fields have been
growing smoothly since the two countries established diplomatic
ties 26 years ago.
</P>
<P>
In the past few years, Zhu said, bilateral high-level exchanges
have increased, and remarkable progress has been made in bilateral
economic and trade cooperation, as well as scientific,
technological and cultural exchanges.
</P>
<P>
The economies of the two countries are highly complementary and
still have potential for bilateral economic cooperation, Zhu noted.
</P>
<P>
Praising Italy's small- and medium-sized enterprises for their
vigor and distinct characteristics, Zhu said that China can learn
a lot from Italy in this regard, as many Chinese small- and
medium-sized enterprises need to be upgraded.
</P>
<P>
Prodi said that Italy-China relations have a long history, and
bilateral political relations are good. Furthermore, the two
countries share close cooperation in the economy, science and
technology and culture. Bilateral economic cooperation was
fruitful during '80s, he said.
</P>
<P>
Over the past year, such a close cooperative relationship
between the two sides has been restored and developed, he said.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the Italian government regards China as an
important cooperative partner, Prodi said that the Italian
government will focus on the important events taking place in
China in 1997.
</P>
<P>
He said that Italy will make energetic efforts to raise
bilateral relations to a new level by expanding bilateral
cooperation in various areas, including politics, economy, trade,
science and technology, and culture, he said.
</P>
<P>
He revealed that at the end of this year, Italy will hold a
large exhibition in China in a move to introduce Italy to the
Chinese people.
</P>
<P>
Saying that bilateral economic and trade cooperation has great
potential, Prodi noted that the two sides, while making the best
use of their similarities, can conduct more in-depth and overall
cooperation in new ways and forms.
</P>
<P>
Italian small- and medium-sized enterprises have advanced
technology, and the two countries can step up technological
cooperation in this regard, Prodi said.

<HEADLINE> Chinese President Meets Italian Prime Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 6 (Xinhua) -- President Jiang Zemin said here
today that China and Italy should make concerted efforts to
actively push forward the development of bilateral friendly and
cooperative relations for the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
Jiang made the remark here this morning when meeting with
visiting Italian Prime Minister Romano Prodi.
</P>
<P>
Expressing his pleasure at meeting with Prodi, Jiang noted that
Italy enjoys a long history and splendid culture, and the Italian
people have made outstanding contributions to human civilization
and social progress, citing some Italian scientists and artists
like Galileo, Dante, Leonardo da Vinci and Michelangelo Buonarroti.
</P>
<P>
Although China and Italy are far away from each other, the
traditional friendship between the two peoples dates back to
ancient times, he said, adding that Marco Polo is well known among
Chinese people for his great contributions to the exchanges
between the East and the West.
</P>
<P>
Recalling his visit to Italy, Jiang said that Italian culture,
arts, and science and technology left him with a deep impression.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that since China and Italy set up diplomatic ties in
1970, bilateral relations have had a rapid development and leaders
of the two countries have kept constant contacts.
</P>
<P>
Bilateral exchanges and cooperation in politics, economy,
trade, science and technology, and culture have been continuously
developed and bilateral cooperative spheres have continued to
expand, added Jiang.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the two economies have their own characteristics,
Jiang pointed out that Italy has its own advantages in a number of
areas which are priority areas for China's development and worth
China's learning, such as advanced technologies and management
experiences.
</P>
<P>
Jiang noted that the development of bilateral friendly
relations of cooperation have a broad prospect.
</P>
<P>
Stressing that China has always paid much attention to its
friendly relations and cooperation with Italy, Jiang said that the
two countries share identical or similar views on many major
international issues, and a full range of common interests in
seeking for peace and promoting development, despite the
differences between their social systems, historical, and cultural
traditions, and economic development.
</P>
<P>
Under the multi-polarization of the current world, Jiang said,
all countries should respect each other, seek common ground while
reserving differences, strengthen cooperation, and promote a
common development.
</P>
<P>
The establishment of a long-term stable Sino-Italian
relationship is not only in conformity with the common aspiration
and fundamental interests of the two peoples, but also conducive
to world peace, stability, and prosperity.
</P>
<P>
Saying that this is his first visit to China as Italian Prime
Minister, Prodi said that Italy-China friendship and cooperation
had been in the first place among Sino-European relations in the
past, while in the past few years, the development of Italy-China
relations has slowed.
</P>
<P>
He said his current visit here is to be a new opportunity for
the two sides to restore and further develop bilateral cooperative
relations.
</P>
<P>
During this visit, Prodi said, he and Chinese leaders have
conducted a wide-range of in-depth discussions on the development
trend for bilateral cooperation in politics, economy, trade,
science and technology, and culture.
</P>
<P>
He also held talks with China's concerned departments, which
were conducive and fruitful.
</P>
<P>
Noting that Italy, with its own characteristics, is different
from other European countries, Prodi pointed out that bilateral
cooperations should also have their own characteristics.
</P>
<P>
Italian small- and medium-sized enterprises have advanced
technologies, and they are willing to conduct cooperation with
their counterparts across China, especially with those enterprises
in China's central and western areas for they share similar
situations with some Italian cities, said Prodi.
</P>
<P>
Besides, both sides can also further strengthen their
cooperation in energy, communications, and telecommunications.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Jiang also asked Prime Minister Prodi to
convey his regards to Italian President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Qiao Shi, chairman of the Standing Committee of the
Chinese National People's Congress (NPC), also met with the
Italian Prime Minister Prodi here this morning.

<HEADLINE> DPRK: S. Korean Warships Open Fire at Fishing Boats </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PYONGYANG, June 6 (Xinhua) -- Three South Korean warships
intruded into the territorial waters of the Democratic People's
Republic of Korea (DPRK) on Thursday and opened fire at fishing
boats, the Korean Central News Agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
"The warships infiltrated from Taeyonphyong Island into the
waters south of Ssanggyo-ri, Kangryong County, South Hwanghae
Province, and surrounded the fishing boats in a bid to kidnap
them," the news agency said.
</P>
<P>
When a naval patrol ship of the Korean People's Army appeared
on the scene, the enemy ships fired shells at the fishing boats
before fleeing south, it said.
</P>
<P>
But the news agency said the military provocation did not
develop into an armed conflict because of "the patience and
self-control" of the soldiers of the Korean People's Army.

"We must pay heed to people's real concerns: jobs, crime, the
environment, security. Those are the priorities of the people in
Europe," Blair said.

HONG KONG, June 6 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's gold imports reached
their highest level in seven years for the first quarter of 1997,
rising threefold over the same period last year, today's Hong Kong
Standard reported.
</P>
<P>
The World Gold Council manager for Hong Kong and southern
China, Emily Li, said 120 tons of gold bars were imported in the
first quarter.
</P>
<P>
And sales during the period jumped by 20 percent over the same
1996 quarter to 13.5 tons, she said, adding high consumption
resulted from a mix of low prices and keen demand, especially
during the Lunar New Year.
</P>
<P>
Li expected retail sales to continue to increase this year
because many gold products had been shaped for the handover.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong remains Asia's No. 1 gold distribution center in terms
of quantity and jewelry designs.
</P>
<P>
It imported and distributed 2,900 tons of gold bars in the past
ten years, Li said.

KUALA LUMPUR, June 6 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia and Thailand today
agreed to set up more joint committees to deal with matters
relating to their relations and further enhance their existing
close cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The two countries also agreed to fix a time frame for the
implementation of joint projects to ensure that such projects are
completed on schedule.
</P>
<P>
The agreements were reached at a meeting here today attended by
Thai Deputy Prime Minister Amnuay Virawan and Malaysian Acting
Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim, both of whom are also finance
ministers.
</P>
<P>
Briefing reporters after the meeting, the Malaysian Finance
Ministry's Deputy Secretary-General Aris Othman said the meeting
also discussed ways to standardize the customs procedures of both
countries in an effort to further increase bilateral trade with
the removal of as many obstacles as possible.
</P>
<P>
Aris said that during the discussion on a proposed land bridge
between Pulau Pinang and Songkla, it was suggested that a land
bridge be constructed to link Pulau Pinang with Pattani instead
because of the deeper sea level between the two points.
</P>
<P>
The construction of gas and petroleum pipelines was also
proposed along with the land bridge, he said.

<P>
The official said the two countries also agreed to discuss

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Steps up Fight Against Drug, Money </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 6 (Xinhua) -- South Africa has been
contacting with regional and international law enforcement agencies
in the fight against drug trafficking and money laundering.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued here today, Justice Minister Dullah Omar
said South African has signed several international conventions
aimed at establishing a cooperative framework to exchange
information with other countries on drug smuggling.
</P>
<P>
He said South Africa's recent amended extradition act would
tighten the net around drug traffickers who he said could now
stand trial overseas.
</P>
<P>
A key issue under review is streamlining the judicial systems
of member countries of the Southern African Development Community.
</P>
<P>
A pact to this effect, signed by SADC heads of state in
Maseru last year, outlawed all forms of drug trafficking, he
added.
</P>
<P>
According to the minister, a further step was taken when
southern and eastern African states agreed to establish a
regional task force to fight money laundering.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: United Opposition in Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 6 (Xinhua) -- One day hopes for a united
opposition were painted stronger than ever in the Philippines, and
the other day one possible partner threw them into clouds.
</P>
<P>
Senator Miriam Defensor Santiago, president of the People's
Reform Party (PRP), announced Thursday that she had broken off
talks with three other opposition parties which wanted to unify
all oppositions to give the ruling party a good fight in the 1998
presidential election.
</P>
<P>
"I was led into the talks under false promises," she said,
adding that she was told earlier that all opposition parties would
be given "equal chances of fielding a common presidential
candidate".
</P>
<P>
"But this is no longer the case," she said in response to a
declaration attributed to Senate President Ernesto Maceda that the
proposed merged parties would choose their presidential candidate
only between Vice President Joseph Estrada and Senator Edgardo
Angara.
</P>
<P>
Estrada heads the Partido ng Masang Pilipino (PMP) while Angara
is chairman of the Laban ng Demokratikong Pilipino (Laban).
Besides PMP, Laban and PRP, the united opposition would also
include Nationalist People's Coalition (NPC) headed by Maceda.
</P>
<P>
The latest development in the opposition bloc will certainly be
a good message to the ruling Lakas-NUCD party, which has scoffed
at the future of the proposed united opposition.
</P>
<P>
"I think what they have achieved is to build a jeep with four
or five steering wheels," said Gabriel Claudio, deputy secretary
general of the Lakas-NUCD. "When they are able to come up with a
formula on how to choose their common standard-bearer, which I
think is the real bottom line, I don't think then that this will
work."
</P>
<P>
Claudio's views are shared by some politicians in the country.
Since not a single opposition party can compete with the
formidable ruling party, it is a good idea to bring all opposition
parties under a single political umbrella, but the real test is
who will be the standard bearer.
</P>
<P>
Vice President Estrada, a former movie star popular among the
poor people, has been leading all opinion polls in approval
rating. He has already expressed his aspiration for the presidency
and has not lost an election since he entered politics to run for
town mayor in 1972. He has cut all ties with the Fidel Ramos
administration by resigning as the head of the Presidential
Anti-Crime Commission Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Santiago, less popular than Estrada in surveys, is a feisty
former judge who vows to jail all corrupt officials if she becomes
president. She narrowly lost to Ramos in the 1992 presidential
race, accused him of poll fraud and challenged him to a boxing
match which Ramos did not take up. She said earlier that she would
join the united opposition if she could become the common
candidate.
</P>
<P>
Angara, president of the biggest opposition Laban, is not as
popular as Estrada, but he has a great party machine that Estrada
and Santiago don't have. While Estrada and Santiago both have the
backing of small parties, Laban currently has 26 congressmen, 13
senators, 7 provincial governors and over 300 local mayors.
</P>
<P>
Then comes the question of selecting the standard bearer.
Estrada has said he does not want to be a vice president any more;
Angara is talking like the leader of the opposition parties;
Santiago is quitting talks and expressing dissatisfaction over
Estrada.
</P>
<P>
Local analysts said the united opposition may come into
existence only when all parties concerned can come up with a set
of rules for the game and no party will back out if its leader has
not been chosen.
</P>
<P>
But on the contrary, it seems none of the three aspirants is
ready to make a concession. Therefore, some local analysts said
the united opposition would not prosper, describing it as a "time
bomb" that can explode at any time.
</P>
<P>
After Santiago announced her withdrawal, Maceda quickly
clarified his statement, saying that he made it at a time when he
was not yet informed by Angara that Santiago had already decided
to join the new party.
</P>
<P>
The Laban party was also "shocked". Laban treasurer Ernesto
Herrera said what the other three parties can do is to court
Santiago again.
</P>
<P>
But local analysts are asking whether it is too late to bring
her back. Or even if she comes back, will voters see a real united
opposition at this time next year in the presidential election,
they query.

<HEADLINE> Kindergartens in Sarawak Close Due to Outbreak of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, June 6 (Xinhua) -- Kindergartens registered with
the state government have been closed until further notice in
Sarawak, East Malaysia, due to the outbreak of the deadly
Coxsackie B virus, according to the Malaysian national news agency
Bernama today.
</P>
<P>
The Coxsackie B virus, known to infect children below four
years of age, has so far claimed 17 lives in Sarawak since April
14 when the first fatal case in the state was reported.
</P>
<P>
Bernama quoted state education department director Putit Matzen
as saying in Kuching, Sarawak's capital, today the decision was
aimed at preventing young children from crowding around and from
being exposed to the viral infection.
</P>
<P>
Putit said schools in the affected areas need not close, but
parents could choose not to send pupils of grade one to three to
class if they feared the pupils would be infected.
</P>
<P>
The official said that the department was leaving it to
headmasters to decide whether there was a need to close primary
one to three classes in their respective schools.
</P>
<P>
Putit called on pre-schools in the state that had not
registered with the state education department to take similar
action.
</P>
<P>
The Federal Health Ministry Thursday advised operators of
places of interest in Sarawak frequented by preschoolers to
temporarily stop operations.
</P>
<P>
Health Minister Chua Jui Meng said here today the government
staff in Sarawak are working very hard at preventing and
controlling this problem by consistently being in consultation
with experts from the World Health Organization.
</P>
<P>
However, Chua said there was no need for the public to be
unduly alarmed as everything was under control.
</P>
<P>
The Coxsackie virus was named after Coxsackie town, New York,
the United States, where the virus was first discovered in 1948.
The virus has A and B types with B type dangerous, causing fever
and sore throat, and also harm to brain, nerve and heart.

<HEADLINE> Dhaka to Spend 3.19 Billion Dollars on Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, June 6 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh is expected to spend
127.55 billion taka (about 3.19 billion U.S. dollars) for
implementing the new Annual Development Program (ADP) for the next
fiscal year from this July to next June, according to official
sources.
</P>
<P>
The ADP, with 54 percent of the fund coming from the domestic
resources, is to raise the growth of Gross Domestic Product (GDP)
to at least six percent from the current 5.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
It is envisaged that Bangladesh will generate 68.85 billion
taka (about 1.72 billion dollars) from its own resources while the
remaining 53.17 billion taka (about 1.35 billion dollars) will
come as foreign aid and 5.53 billion taka (about 136 million
dollars) from food aid against the Food-for-Work Program.
</P>
<P>
In the current fiscal year's ADP, domestic resources
contributed 67.76 billion taka (about 1.69 billion dollars) and
foreign aid came to 49.24 billion taka (about 1.23 billion
dollars).
</P>
<P>
The budgetary allocation in the new ADP has been earmarked
consistent with the target of the Fifth Five-Year Plan, also to be
launched in July.
</P>
<P>
The Fifth Five-Year Plan has targeted, on average, a 7 percent
GDP growth by implementing its programs, including the ADP.
</P>
<P>
The new ADP, which is to be placed before Parliament on June
12, includes a total of 278 new projects of which 239 are
investment projects and 39 technical assistance. With the
inclusion, the total number of projects in the new ADP for the
fiscal 1997-98 stands at 1,242.
</P>
<P>
Sixty-four projects without budgetary allocation have also been
included in the new ADP for facilitating the negotiation of
foreign fund.
</P>
<P>
The proposed ADP has given utmost emphasis on poverty
eradication and improvement of literacy as part of human resource
development. A total of 41.78 billion taka (about 1.04 billion
dollars) has been earmarked for the social sector.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics show that over half of its 120 million
people live below the poverty line and only 30 percent can read
and write in this south Asian country.

LAGOS, June 6 (Xinhua) -- Indisciplined lifestyles and
uncontrolled plunder of natural resources are posing serious threat
to the environment in Nigeria, said Head of State General Sani
Abacha.
</P>
<P>
Abacha, in a message to mark the World Environment Day on

the environment.
</P>
<P>
He also warned that Nigerians must individually and
collectively retrace their steps to avoid further complication of
the threat.

<P>
Nigeria is now paying for the errors of past development
activities and indisciplined lifestyles which have devastated the
nation's natural resources, rapidly expanding arid lands,
deserts, erosion and causing urban infrastructural decay, said
the head of state.
</P>
<P>
According to Abacha, the government has promulgated an
environmental impact assessment decree to ensure that
environmental protection measures are adequately considered in
development projects.
</P>
<P>
The Vision 2010, the national body in charge of making
long-term development strategies, has been asked to provide a

<HEADLINE> Australian Shares Close Lower </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, June 6 (Xinhua) -- A wave of institutional selling to
fund the take-up of stock in Foster's Brewing Group Ltd drove
Australian shares to a lower close, inflating overall trading
which raced to a record value of more than 2.66 billion Australian
dollars (2.02 billion US dollars).
</P>
<P>
The previous record turnover in dollar terms was set on May 30,
1997 when 1.88 billion Australian dollar worth of stocks was
traded.
</P>
<P>
The all ordinaries index closed 3.3 down at 2,600.9 but
momentarily slipped below the 2,600 barrier just before the close.
</P>
<P>
More than 1.032 billion shares were traded across the board
with falls outnumbering rises 527 to 474.
</P>
<P>
Both BHP and Foster's shares weakened after the mining giant
sold the bulk of its Foster's stake in four swift pre-market
trades.
</P>
<P>
Foster's topped turnover with more than 678.3 million shares
changing hands worth more than 1.689 billion Australian dollars.
Its shares finished seven cents down at 2.53 Australian dollars.
</P>
<P>
BHP was 11 cents weaker at 18.72 with 3.974 million shares
traded.
</P>
<P>
The trading frenzy followed Thursday's announcement by BHP that
it would end its 11-year link with the brewing group.
</P>
<P>
Traders said the market's overall softness could be attributed
to BHP'S decline.
</P>
<P>
The all industrials index sunk 7.8 points to 4,059.4 while the
all resources index inched 0.4 of a point higher to 1,480.7.
</P>
<P>
The gold index was up 10.1 points to 1,559.5 while gold bullion
closed in Sydney at 344.00 US dollars an ounce from 341.35 US
dollars last.
</P>
<P>
Nomura Australia Securities strategist Eric Betts said the
local market was well positioned going into the Queen's Birthday
long weekend.
</P>
<P>
"On the whole the market is well placed ahead of the long
weekend and the release later tonight of the US non-farm payroll
data," he said.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa, Germany Pledge Further Economic Coop </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 6 (Xinhua) -- Top officials of South Africa
and Germany have pledged to promote bilateral existing economic
relations, local daily Sowetan reported today.
</P>
<P>
South African Economic Minister Alec Erwin, who is visiting
Germany, told a joint trade and investment conference in Bonn that
there should be regular economic consultations, including the
participation of companies of the two countries, said the report.
</P>
<P>
German Economic Minister Guenter Rexrodt, who stood for the
proposal, said such meeting would help seeking agreement between
the two countries on all current issues affecting economic
relations.
</P>
<P>
According to Rexrodt, a new investment promotion agreement
between Germany and South Africa is to take effect within the
next few months.
</P>
<P>
Bonn had agreed to guarantee some 35 million U.S. Dollars in
Germany's capital investment in South Africa, while applications
for a further 94 million Dollars are "in pipe line", he said.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, Bonn provided guarantees for 761 million Dollars in
German exports to South Africa, adding Germany would also provide
sufficient backing in 1997 as well through the state-owned
insurance company Hermes.
</P>
<P>
The current trade volume between South Africa and Germany
recorded nearly five billion U.S. Dollars with the latter's
capital investment in South Africa registering 1.5 billion
Dollars.
</P>
<P>
South African Foreign Minister Alfred Nzo once described
Germany as a country playing "an outstanding role as a partner of
South Africa."
</P>
<P>
At the moment there are some 300 German companies active in
South Africa, providing 60,000 local jobs, according to official
statistics.

<HEADLINE> NPC Chairman Meets Visiting Italian Prime Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 6 (Xinhua) -- Qiao Shi, chairman of China's
National People's Congress (NPC) Standing Committee, said China
attaches importance to developing a long-term and stable
relationship with Italy and is ready to increase mutual
cooperation in every field.
</P>
<P>
Meeting with visiting Italian Prime Minister Romano Prodi, Qiao
said that Sino-Italian ties in various areas have been invigorated
in recent years as shown by the frequent contacts maintained by
leaders of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The NPC chairman recalled his Italy tour two months ago, which
he said has left an "unforgettable impression" on him.
</P>
<P>
The exchange between the NPC and the Italian parliament has
also been reinforced along with the development of bilateral
relations, Qiao said.
</P>
<P>
He added that he agrees with Nicola Mancino, president of the
Italian Senate, on the point that the friendly and cooperative
links between NPC and Italian parliament should be further
promoted.
</P>
<P>
Qiao also briefed Prodi on NPC's legislative activities.
</P>
<P>
Prodi said that the past year has seen an increase of visits
between Italian and Chinese leaders, which has created favourable
conditions for expanding bilateral economic cooperation and the
friendship between the two peoples.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister told Qiao that his entourage includes many
Italian entrepreneurs, whose contacts with their Chinese
counterparts would expand and deepen bilateral collaboration.
</P>
<P>
Prodi said that China's NPC has had many achievements in
legislation and expressed the hope that the legislatures of the
two countries would increase contacts and enhance cooperation.

<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, June 6 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President Soeharto has
appointed army chief Lt. Gen. Hartono as information minister,
replacing Harmoko who will be named state minister for special
affairs, a new cabinet post.
</P>
<P>
State Secretary/Minister Moerdiono said here that the president
will induct Hartono as information minister on June 11 at the
State Palace.
</P>
<P>
He also said that President Soeharto named Lt. Gen. Wiranto,
currently head of the army's strategic command, as new chief of
staff.
</P>
<P>
Wiranto will be assisted by the newly-appointed deputy army
chief of staff Maj. Gen. Subagio, who is currently chief of the
Diponegoro military district command.
</P>
<P>
Moerdiono said that Wiranto and Subagio will be promoted to a
higher rank in the near future, along with the air force chief of
staff, the navy chief of staff and the Indonesian police chief.
</P>

the presidential guards, as head of the army's strategic command.
</P>
<P>
On whether Harmoko will continue to be chairman of the House of
Representatives/People's Consultative Assembly, Moerdiono said,

<HEADLINE> Irish Voters Cast Ballots in General Election </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 6 (Xinhua) -- Over 2.7 million people across the
Republic of Ireland began to cast their ballots this morning in
the country's general election, press reports from Dublin said.
</P>
<P>
The ruling three-party coalition of the Fine Gael, Labor, and
Democratic Left, the opposition alliance of the Fianna Fail and
Progressive Democrats, and some other smaller political parties
will battle for the 166 seats of the Dail (the lower house of the
Irish parliament) in 44 constituencies all over the country.
</P>
<P>
Opinion polls indicate that Prime Minister John Bruton's
coalition government has been consistently trailed the main
opposition alliance in public support. The opposition alliance is
tipped to win the election.
</P>
<P>
No Irish government has won an re-election since 1969, but
Prime Minister Bruton has vowed to win over the 14-percent
undecided voters in a bid to turn the tables.
</P>
<P>
Ireland's general election is held under a proportional
representation system, which is widely regarded as
favorable to smaller parties.
</P>
<P>
The turn-out in the 1992 election was 68.5 percent.
Fianna Fail, the country's largest political party, took 68
seats of the 166-seated Dail, Fine Gael 45, Labor 33, the
Progressive Democrats 10, Democratic Left four and other
six.

"Speed has had, without precedent, a deep impact on different
aspects of life for a gigantic number of people," a local
economist said.
</P>
<P>
Profound changes have occurred in China's vast rural areas,
where time had been measured by sunrise and sunset for
centuries. Old animal-driven carts have been replaced by motorized
farm vehicles. Farmers in developed areas, who years ago had
nothing but spades and sickles in their hands, now use mobile
phones to conduct business or manage farmland with the aid of
computers.
</P>
<P>
Changes in urban areas also have altered certain fundamental
ways of living, such as eating. Chinese- or foreign-style
fast-food restaurants have spread nationwide. But, one frequent
fast-food patron admits he goes "not for the taste, but for saving
time".
</P>
<P>
Other services speeding the pace of life include freight
couriers, express mail, telephone shopping, and on-line ordering.
</P>
<P>
Government organs have also made efforts to appear more
efficient. Seven government departments in Beijing, such as
industry and commerce administration, custom house, and taxation
organ, early this year organized a unified annual check-up for
ventures with overseas investment. The one-office-for-all method
was acclaimed an effective way to reduce the workload of the
enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Social researchers have scrutinized the changes intensely.
</P>
<P>
"The economic goals set by the country determined that
high-speed development is an essential requirement to reach the
targets," said a sociologist with China Academy of Social Sciences.
</P>
<P>
"Even though China has quadrupled its gross national product
ahead of the schedule, the country has to keep around 9-percent
growth in the ensuing years for its second strategic goal -- to
become a medium-level developed country in the mid-21st century,"
he added.
</P>
<P>
Another expert said that "The world is changing. To keep pace
with global trends, China has to change even faster while
overcoming the rigidness of its past system."
</P>
<P>
All experts agreed that the faster pace of life is an
illustration of social progress in the country. As one expert put
it: "The further development of China's modernization will
definitely accelerate the pace of life in the future."

<HEADLINE> OAU Summit Very Successful, Mkapa Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, June 6 (Xinhua) -- President Benjamin Mkapa on
Thursday said the just ended OAU Summit in Harare, Zimbabwe, was
very successful endorsing important political and economic
decisions.
</P>
<P>
Outlining his impressions on the three-day summit, President
Mkapa said in Dar es Salaam that beside adopting key resolutions,
the meeting was attended by more African leaders than any other
such OAU gathering in the organisation's history.
</P>
<P>
According to a press release issued by the State House in the
city, the president said that one of the historical
pronouncements by the Heads of State was the condemnation of the
Sierra Leone coup which overthrew a popularly-elected government,
saying the act was not acceptable in today's Africa.
</P>
<P>
He said it was evident that African leaders no longer approve
suppressive regimes and the endless conflicts in the continent.
</P>
<P>
That is why, Mkapa said, the leaders resolved to restore the
overthrown government by every possible means.
</P>
<P>
Another achievement of the Harare meeting, the president said, was
the resolve to form the African Economic Community under the Abuja OAU
resolution.
</P>
<P>
For the first time in history the leaders met as the first
African Economic Community Summit to discuss regional reports of
regional economic groupings like the SADC, IGAD, ECOWAS, COMESA
and Maghreb, he added.
</P>
<P>
Mkapa said the regional economic groupings were instrumental
in boosting Africa's economic might.
</P>
<P>
"African countries have for the first time stated
categorically that they were now interested in economic
liberation having completed the liberation of the continent from
colonial rule," the president stressed.

<HEADLINE> France, U.S. Opposed Downlisting of Ivory Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, June 6 (Xinhua) -- France and the United States both
strongly opposed to the bid by southern African countries to
allow limited trade in ivory, but might consider solutions for
the specific problems of Zimbabwe, Botswana and Namibia.
</P>
<P>
The French government has made clear its position that
elephants, classified as endangered species, remain in Appendix I
of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species
(CITES) which does not allow any trade in ivory.
</P>
<P>
"Normally the French government would wish that the elephants
remain in Appendix I to avoid liberalizing of ivory trade because
the situation of elephants on the continent is heterogeneous,"
said a spokesman of the French Embassy in Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe, which is hosting the 10th CITES conference from June
9 to 20, have been campaigning hard with Botswana and Namibia for
downlisting elephants from Appendix I to Appendix II which allows
controlled trade.
</P>
<P>
"The situation in west Africa regarding elephants is different
but France is open to discuss the specific problems of southern
African region," said the French embassy spokesman.
</P>
<P>
The United States said it was firmly opposed to the bid to
open ivory trade saying this risked the remaining elephant
populations on the continent.
</P>
<P>
European diplomat in Harare also supported the idea that the
ban on ivory trade be maintained though many countries will have
an open attitude about the problems in Zimbabwe, Botswana and
Namibia.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe, Botswana and Namibia need support from two-thirds of
the CITES members to get their elephant populations off the
endangered species list, which they have tried to do without
success at the last three CITES meetings since 1990.

<HEADLINE> Northwest China to Open up More Wasteland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, June 6 (Xinhua) -- The Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region
in Northwest China plans to turn another 300,000 ha of wasteland
into green fields in the next three years, in its continuing
efforts to promote agricultural development.
</P>
<P>
The ethnic region has cultivated 210,000 ha of wasteland over
the past five years to become China's largest cotton producer and
an important grain production base.
</P>
<P>
Xinjiang covers an area of 1.66 million sq km, accounting for
one-sixth of the country, and has about 4.86 million ha of arable
wasteland, which is expected to partly ease China's grain shortage
in the next century.
</P>
<P>
Local farmers from various ethnic groups still remain the
driving force in cultivating wasteland. One farmer in the Tarim
Basin has opened up more than 1,300 ha of wasteland.
</P>
<P>
Governments, enterprises, and overseas investors have also
joined the campaign. The State and localities have put more than a
billion yuan into the development of Xinjiang's water and soil in
recent years, while Chinese and overseas enterprises have invested
400 million yuan for the same purposes.
</P>
<P>
To encourage wasteland improvement, the region has adopted some
preferential policies, including interest-free and low-interest
loans, and longer leasing time for land use.

<TEXT>
<P>
XIAMEN, June 6 (Xinhua) -- East China's city of Xiamen now
reports its atmospheric conditions to the public every Friday
through the local media.
</P>
<P>
Over the past few years, the city has redoubled its efforts in
air pollution control, and the air quality has maintained the
state's top atmospheric standards for eight consecutive years.
</P>
<P>
However, with the rapid social and economic development, the
sources of air pollution may also increase, and more pollutants
will be discharged into the air, some experts here believe.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, people's demand for clean air is growing with the
improvement of their living conditions.
</P>
<P>
The aim of the weekly air quality report is to put the city's
air condition under the public scrutiny, so as to upgrade the
city's environmental protection work.
</P>
<P>
Xiamen plans to speed up the automatization of its environment
monitoring system and try to provide daily air reports as soon as
possible.

<HEADLINE> Israel To Exhibit Most Advanced Missile At Paris </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 6 (Xinhua) -- After several years of secrecy,
the Armament Development Authority (Rafael) of Israel has decided
to unveil the most advanced air-to-air missile of the Python-4
at the Paris Air Show later this month.
</P>
<P>
The pro-government English daily of The Jerusalem Post today
reported that the Python-4 is the fourth generation and the most
advanced of the model and has been quietly sold to several air
forces.
</P>
<P>
Executives at the Haifa-based firm said the missile, which
has been used by the air force for several years, outperforms
previous generations of air-to-air missiles in maneuverability,
target acquisition, and overcoming decoys.
</P>
<P>
Tadiran Spectralink, a defense company based in Holon outside
Tel Aviv, said it will also exhibit its new airborne
search-and-rescue system at the show. This will allow downed
pilots and special forces operating behind enemy lines to be
rescued under severe combat conditions.
</P>
<P>
The system is a departure from the traditional
direction-finding beacon technology in which the signal must be
constantly transmitted, thus jeopardizing the stranded ground
forces and the rescue teams.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Elisra Electronic Systems, based in Bnei Brak
near Tel Aviv, plans to disply its AES-210 air-borne electronic
warfare system.
</P>
<P>
Another system to be exhibited is the SPS-1000V-5 radar
warning receiver, meant to protect fixed-wing aircraft from being
tracked by the enemy.
</P>
<P>
Elisra's passive airborne warning system, which is in the
final development and evaluation stage, will also be featured in
Paris. The system provides fighter aircraft and combat
helicopters with a warning apparatus against air-to-air and
surface-to-air missiles.

<HEADLINE> PKK Kidnaps 8 Workers in Southeastern Turkey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, June 6 (Xinhua) -- Rebels of the outlawed Kurdish
Workers' Party (PKK) kidnaped eight workers late Thursday night
in southeastern Turkey, the semi-official Anatolia News Agency
reported this morning.
</P>
<P>
The agency said that a group of the PKK militants
gathered the workers in Dilimli Dam construction site near
Yuksekova-Esendere highway of Hakkari province bordering Iran at
about 23:00 local time (20:00 GMT) and took them away in the
dark.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish security forces started large-scale search
operations in the region in a bid to capture the PKK kidnapers,
said the agency.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, the agency said that the Turkish
security forces killed 14 PKK members in Kocacimen village of
Kemaliye town, eastern province of Erzican Thursday.
</P>
<P>
One police soldier also died in the five-hour-long conflict,
said the agency.
</P>
<P>
In another development, some PKK guerrillas attacked Yalinca
Gendarma station in Gurpinar town of Van province bordering Iran
at 23:00 local time (20:00 GMT) Wednesday and one police
soldier died in the armed clash between the PKK and Turkish
soldiers, said the agency.
</P>
<P>
It added that one PKK member was also killed in the
30-minute-long clash.
</P>
<P>
About 50,000-strong Turkish government troops have carried out
cross-border military operations in northern Iraq since May 14
to wipe out the PKK establishment there.
</P>
<P>
Turkish military officials have said that at least 2,000
PKK members have been killed in the military campaign in
northern Iraq, but the PKK claimed that its losses were less
than 100 people.
</P>
<P>
Khalil Attachi, leader of the PKK was quoted by a
newspaper as saying in Lebanon Monday that his group will
attack Israeli and U.S. targets in Turkish cities and tourist
areas.
</P>
<P>
Attachi said that his organization will "carry out operations
against Israeli targets in Istanbul (Turkey's largest city) and
elsewhere in Turkey and against the U.S. enemy interests."
</P>
<P>
The PKK has been fighting an almost 13-year-old separatist
war for autonomy, which has claimed over 23,000 lives in
eastern and southeastern Turkey since August 1984.

BEIJING, June 6 (Xinhua) -- The correct use of the Chinese
national flag and the regional flag of the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (SAR) have been determined in regulations
passed by the 58th executive meeting of the State Council, held
here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
In accordance with the National Flag Law of the People's
Republic of China, the regulations demand that when the national
flag and regional flag of the Hong Kong SAR are raised or used at
the same time, the national flag should be at the central, a
higher or prominent position.
</P>
<P>
When the two flags are used at the same time and placed side by
side, the national flag should be larger than the regional flag,
with the national flag taking the right position and the regional
flag taking the left.
</P>
<P>
In procession, the national flag should be raised in front of
the regional flag, according to the regulations.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> India's First Quarter Gold Demand Sets New Record </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, June 6 (Xinhua) -- Demand for gold in India set a
new quarterly record when it reached 161.70 tons in the first
quarter of 1997.
</P>
<P>
This was up by 38 percent from the corresponding period a year
ago and 12 percent ahead of the previous record of 143.90 tons,
said the latest quarterly study by the World Gold Council (WGC).
</P>
<P>
Gold imports into India during the first quarter of this year
have reached a record of 116.90 tons, well above the quarterly
record of 76 tons set in the fourth quarter of 1996.
</P>
<P>
The recent moves on the part of the Indian government to
liberalize the trade in gold will lead to increased legal imports,
away from the unofficial or parallel supplies of the yellow metal,
the WGC study said.
</P>
<P>
India is one of the world's fastest growing jewelry centers and
is becoming an important destination on the itineraries of jewelry
buyers the world over.
</P>
<P>
The process of accelerated deregulation in India following the
Delhi gold economic conference in November 1996 and the doubling
of import allowances to 10 kg for non-resident Indians will
encourage more companies to import gold and pave the way for
further improvements in distribution and domestic demand.

<HEADLINE> North China Using Overseas Talents in Agriculture </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, June 6 (Xinhua) -- Technical advice from Japanese
experts has helped farmers in Shunping County of north China's
Hebei Province earn 370 yuan more per capita from their apple
crops.
</P>
<P>
The county imported a high-quality variety of Japanese apple in
the early 1980s, but poor management led to low yields. Soon
after, the county authorities invited Japanese experts to guide
the cultivation.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the production rate of high quality apples has
been raised from 30 percent to 70 percent. In same cases, the
per-ha apple output is as high as 60,000 to 75,000 kg.
</P>
<P>
Shunping is just one example of a foreign expert-assisted
project with a happy ending: Hebei has so far launched more than
260 programs to bring in overseas professionals in various fields,
which has helped resolve 152 technical difficulties in
agricultural production, develop 110 new products, and bring about
650 million yuan in economic profit.
</P>
<P>
The province sent more than 300 students or scholars abroad,
and some who have returned from the United States have applied a
detoxification technique to 80 percent of Hebei's strawberry
seedlings, reporting good results.
</P>
<P>
Hebei recently signed agriculture agreements with five European
countries to conduct technical and personnel exchanges.

<HEADLINE> China, Germany Join Hands in Fighting Desertification </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TAIYUAN, June 6 (Xinhua) -- On a historical ancient battlefield
covering Shanxi Province and the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region,
forestry experts from China and Germany are fighting
desertification shoulder to shoulder with unusual weapons: poplar
trees.
</P>
<P>
Local people have planted many poplar trees in the area since
New China was founded in 1949. But the small-leaf poplars cannot
adapt to the harsh weather there, and wither in only 20 years.
</P>
<P>
In 1984, a new forestry project was launched. Unlike previous
programs, 10.6 million German marks worth of free aid from Germany
was involved in the effort.
</P>
<P>
Since 1984, modern labs have been set up in the area and
advanced facilities introduced from overseas. So far, technicians
have collected nearly 1,000 varieties of poplars and set up the
largest poplar gene bank in the country.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, 35 species of poplar trees that grow rapidly
and are better able to withstand cold weather and wind have been
developed. Test forests of various types were planted, where the
survival rate of the trees were increased by ten to 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
The various poplar species and technology to grow them have
been introduced to other parts of northern China and shown
profitable results, according to officials in charge of the
cooperation project.
</P>
<P>
In May of 1996 a decision was made by the Sino-German committee
to extend the project by three years. Another three million German
Marks will be put into the work.

<HEADLINE> Round-up: Netanyahu Plan on Final Settlement Draws </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 6 (Xinhua) -- The plan proposed by Prime
Minister Binyamin Netanyahu on the final Israeli-Palestinian
settlement has triggered mixed reactions across Israel's political
spectrum.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu presented his proposal Wednesday to the inner
cabinet for discussion. The Prime Minister's Office called it
as the "Allon-Plus" plan, because it is an enlarged version
of the original formula proposed by late Foreign Minister
Yigal Allon after the 1967 war.
</P>
<P>
In the plan, Netanyahu envisioned retaining control over the
strategic borders, Greater Jerusalem, settlements, water resources
and key roads in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
The disclosure of the plan has caused strong condemnation from
the Palestinian National Authority (PNA), which denounced it for
violating the Oslo accords and warned against leading to violent
confrontation.
</P>
<P>
Back in Israel, the plan also aroused a controversy within
the political spectrum as political factions differed in their
opinions on the Israeli-Palestinian final-status talks.
</P>
<P>
In a sudden burst of dissent, Foreign Minister David Levy
criticized the plan as a premature disclosure made without
prior consulation with other cabinet ministers.
</P>
<P>
Interviewed by state television Channel I Thursday night,
Levy insisted the plan was only "preliminary, embryonic ideas"
and not a cabinet decision. He added that the disclosure
could cause damage to Israel's negotiating stance in future
final-status talks.
</P>
<P>
"As long as these ideas (by different ministers) have not
crystallized and the deliberations still are in their earliest
stage, circulation of these notions only can cause harm," he
said.
</P>
<P>
But the center-rightist party The Third Way, a coalition
partner, praised the disclosure of the Netanyahu plan. A party
statement called it as "a move by the prime minister toward
the responsible and moderate center, while adopting our party's
political-defense map."
</P>
<P>
The Third Way also called Ehud Barak, the newly-elected
leader of the leading opposition Labor party, to support the
plan.
</P>
<P>
However, the Meretz party, Labor's traditional political ally,
condemned the plan as "a bad joke." Meretz leader Yossi
Sarid warned the Labor against accepting the plan, saying he
would not hesitate in distancing his party from the Labor in
that case.
</P>
<P>
"Any plan which does not ultimately call for a Palestinian
state and a withdrawal from most of the territories will not
hold water and is likely to hold blood, lots of blood,"
Sarid said.
</P>
<P>
The Netanyahu plan also came under fire from the extremist
rightist party Moledet, which denounced Netanyahu for going
toward the left. Moledet leader Rehavam Zeevi expressed concern
that Netanyahu would eventually agree to the establishment of
a Palestinian state and surrender of most of the territories.
</P>
<P>
The rightist National Religious Party (NRP), a coalition
partner, reacted cautiously to the Netanyahu plan. Hanan Porat,
chairman of the NRP faction in the Knesset (parliament), said
his party would not leave the government at present because
of the Netanyahu plan.
</P>
<P>
But Porat made it clear that his party would not allow
the government to uproot even a single settlement in the
Palestinian territories. The NRP can easily topple the Netanyahu
government because it owns 9 Knesset seats.
</P>
<P>
By presenting his plan on the final-status talks, which
have been frozen since early last year, Netanyahu is
apparently sending out a test balloon pending the resamption
of the peace talks.
</P>
<P>
The final-status talks will tackle the most sensitive and
difficult issues of the final borders, status of Jerusalem and
Palestinian refugees.
</P>
<P>
Under the Netanyahu plan, the PNA could only get about 40
percent of the West Bank and Gaza Strip, which is much
less than the 90 percent it has required in the final
settlement.
</P>
<P>
The PNA is hoping to create an independent state on most
of the territories with East Jerusalem as capital after
reaching the final settlement, a scenario that has been flatly
rejected by the hardline Netanyahu government.

Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES)
conference which begins in Zimbabwe's capital Harare on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Opening the preparatory dialogue in Darwendale, a suburban
town near Harare yesterday, Zimbabwean Minister of Environment
and Tourism Chen Chimutengwende called on African countries to
speak with one voice at the forthcoming cites meeting, if their
proposals were to be accepted.
</P>
<P>
Botswana, Namibia and Zimbabwe are currently lobbying for
support for the downlisting of the African elephant from CITES
Appendix I to Appendix II, which allows limited trade in the
mammal products.
</P>
<P>
They request for the lift of the trade ban, put in place in
1989, to enable them to dispose ivory stockpiles worth several
millions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
Tanzania, Uganda and Madagascar are requesting for the
downlisting of the crocodile, and South Africa is advocating for
the downlisting of the white rhino.
</P>
<P>
"It is my fervent hope that you will speak as Africans with a
common purpose in the same way people from other continents do,"
said the Zimbabwean minister.
</P>
<P>
The World Conservation Union, organizer and sponsor of the
meeting, also backed the Zimbabwean government's proposal to
downlist the African elephant to allow limited international
ivory trade.

<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, June 6 (Xinhua) -- During April and May, police in
southwest China's border province of Yunnan cracked 1,371 drug
trafficking cases and seized 1,830 drug traffickers.
</P>
<P>
In the two months, a total of 994.8 kg of opium and heroin was
seized, according to Sun Dahong, secretary-general of the Yunnan
Anti-Drug Commission.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has decided to carry out a special
nationwide anti-drug campaign from April to September.
</P>
<P>
Yunnan Province, located next to Vietnam, Myanmar and Laos,
sharing 4,060 km of borders with these countries, plays a key role
in fighting against international drug-trafficking.
</P>
<P>
Sun also said that in the two months, more than 7,600 narcotics
users received compulsory treatment.
</P>
<P>
To check the influx of narcotics, an anti-drug headquarters
commanded by the provincial governor was set up in early April.
</P>
<P>
The provincial government set aside ten million yuan (1.2
million US dollars) for the rehabilitation of drug users, and
lower-level governments all provided supporting funds.
</P>
<P>
The provincial government has also exerted great efforts to
mobilize the masses in the fight against drug trafficking and
narcotics consumption.
</P>
<P>
From tips and informants from the masses, 49 drug trafficking
cases were cracked in April and May, and 36 kg of opium and heroin
were seized.
</P>
<P>
Provincial officials said the anti-drug combat will be stepped
up in June to further diminish the influx of narcotics.

<P>
HAIKOU, June 6 (Xinhua) -- The Export-Import Bank of Japan will
grant 100 million U.S. dollars in loans to support construction of
Meilan International Airport in Haikou, capital of South China's
Hainan province.
</P>
<P>
According to an agreement signed recently in Haikou, the loans
will be transferred by the Bank of China Hainan Branch to the
company responsible for airport construction. The money will
mainly be used to purchase equipment and other materials needed in
the construction.
</P>
<P>
The actual building of Meilan International Airport started
this January. According to schedule, 52 sub-projects will be
completed at a budget of 670 million yuan this year.
</P>
<P>
It is expected that main structure of the terminal will be
completed by the end of October, while the installation of
equipment will start in early 1998 and will be finished by the end
of the year.
</P>
<P>
The airport, estimated to cost 2.3 billion yuan (277.11 million
U.S. dollars), was approved for construction by the State Council
in December of 1993. The airport's major equipment will be

<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, June 6 (Xinhua) -- Every morning, Hong Kong
businessman Wong Wiu Kwong catches the Guangdong-Hong Kong shuttle
at a local hotel in Guangzhou, the capital city of Guangdong
Province.
</P>
<P>
Throughout the ride, Wong relaxes in the air-conditioning,
watches TV, and enjoys the free beverages and newspapers provided
to passengers.
</P>
<P>
"Traveling had not been so convenient before this kind of bus
began operation," he recalled. "Before, I had to first take a
train or a ship and then change to a bus."
</P>
<P>
Wong is among tens of thousands people who have benefited from
the fledgling shuttle bus service which links Hong Kong with urban
and rural areas in Guangdong Province. The number of people
traveling between the two places exceeds 60 million annully.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong is the largest investor in Guangdong; nearly 80
percent of processing factories in Hong Kong have been moved to
Guangdong in recent years. Hong Kong-based investors have been
involved in over 80,000 firms in the neighboring province.
</P>
<P>
In 1981, the first such shuttle-bus was put into use by the
Guangdong-Hong Kong Automotive Transport Company, and to date over
500 shuttle-buses, owned by 65 local firms, are engaged in the
lucrative business. More than 30,000 passengers travel on these
buses every day.
</P>
<P>
The growth of the shuttle-bus service has been made possible by
the rapid expansion of expressways, officials from the provincial
communications authority said.
</P>
<P>
The latest statistics show that Guangdong now has 723 km of
freeways, ranking first among all provinces and municipalities in
the country. Moreover, the province plans to construct another 10
expressways with a total length of over 1,000 km.
</P>
<P>
By then, all the major cities and towns in Guangdong will have
access to expressways.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the increasingly competitive market has also brought
down the price of a Guangzhou-Hong Kong shuttle ticket from an
average of 250 yuan to the current price of 150 yuan.

<P>
JERUSALEM, June 6 (Xinhua) -- In their strategic talks, the
United States and Israel have voiced their concerns about Iran's
military build-up, a threat to regional countries.
</P>
<P>
According to the pro-government English daily, The Jerusalem
Post, today, the two-day biannual U.S.-Israel strategic talks
ended in Natanya, north of Tel Aviv, Thursday.
</P>
<P>
A Defense Ministry statement said that the two sides spent a
good deal of time discussing regional terrorism and efforts by
Iran to arm itself, particularly with long-range missiles and
non-conventional weapons. They also discussed assessments of the
general situation in the region.
</P>
<P>
Diplomatic sources said the U.S. and Israel see eye to eye on
what they believe the potential military threat posed by Iran to
almost all of its neighboring states.
</P>
<P>
Iran was described as a threat to the former Soviet republics
of Central Asia, the Arab emirates of the Gulf, Saudi Arabia, and
Israel. Also taken into account was Iran's ongoing logistical
support for Lebanon's Hezbollah guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
There was a consensus in their discussions on the need to
maintain economic sanctions against Iran and Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli delegation was led by David Ivry, special adviser
to Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai, while the U.S. was
represented by Ted MacNamara, Assistant Secretary of State.
</P>
<P>
Working teams presented reports on joint exercises, logistics,
and other areas of cooperation between the defense establishments
of the two allies. The U.S. officials also reiterated

<HEADLINE> Animal Husbandry Keeps Grain Price Stable in East China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JINAN, June 6 (Xinhua) -- Animal husbandry in east China's
Shandong Province has become a major contributor to the steady
growth of grain production, as it consumes and increases value of
nearly half the total grain output annually.
</P>
<P>
The province has no grassland, but it has grown into the
largest livestock producer in China. And the 140-million-tons of
manure from livestock helped produce the province's 43.3 billion
kg of grain last year.
</P>
<P>
It had had 14.5 million of cattle and 49.1 million of sheep by
the end of last year, both ranking first in the country. Livestock
farming eats up more than 30 million tons of farmers' straw,
accounting for 60 percent of the total amount.
</P>
<P>
Livestock raising resulted in maize price hikes last year, and
as a result, the province imported large amounts of maize to meet
the need.
</P>
<P>
As growing animal husbandry demands more grains, it helps
maintain grain prices, which encourages farmers to grow more
crops. Industry insiders call animal husbandry the "stabilizer" of
Shandong's grain production.

<HEADLINE> 1,700-year-old Wooden And Bamboo Slips Well Preserved </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGSHA, June 6 (Xinhua) -- Chinese experts have discovered
why tens of thousands of pieces of bamboo and wood, strung
together to form a book, have been preserved for some 1,700 years
in a well in this capital of central China's Hunan Province.
</P>
<P>
"The well served as an 'underground refrigerator', maintaining
a constant temperature that helped conserve the slips," the
experts say.
</P>
<P>
The well, found at a construction site, has a diameter of three
meters. The inner wall of the well was lined with wooden boards,
and chinked with clay.
</P>
<P>
At the bottom of the well was a smaller square pit to retain
underground water, which could be ladled out if the pit was full.
Straw mats were placed between the bottom of the well and the wood
and bamboo slips.
</P>
<P>
Some 170,000 bamboo and wooden slips bearing 200,000 Chinese
characters were stored in the well, the largest such find ever
reported in the country.
</P>
<P>
The slips record in detail the political, economic, military,
cultural and geographic situation of Changsha prefecture under the
Wu State (222-280) during the Three Kingdoms Period (220-280).
</P>
<P>
The well was actually a cellar which served as a storage space
for archives of the Changsha prefecture at that time, the experts
say.

<HEADLINE> Asia-Pacific Roundtable Opens in Malaysia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, June 6 (Xinhua) -- The 11th Asia-Pacific
Roundtable (APR) conference opened here today to address
prevailing and future security issues in the region.
</P>
<P>
The annual APR in Malaysia this year is part of a continuing
series on the theme "Confidence Building and Conflict Reduction in
the Pacific."
</P>
<P>
Delivering a keynote address at the opening of the three-day
conference, Malaysian Acting Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim said
prosperity has much to do with security and part of the impetus
for strengthening what is called the Pacific peace comes from the
need to foster Pacific prosperity cooperatively.
</P>
<P>
"Shared prosperity promotes peace and stability. It fosters the
social and political environment for the cultivation of civil
society," he said.
</P>
<P>
He outlined three objectives for the Pacific nations to focus
on in the next 25 years.
</P>
<P>
The objectives are "maximize mutual understanding," "strengthen
mutual respect and appreciation" and "foster mutual cultural
enrichment."
</P>
<P>
The Malaysian leader was of the view that mutual understanding
and mutual respect are the beginning of mutual trust.
</P>
<P>
Cultures and civilizations should not divide, on the contrary,
they should arouse interest and spur exchange, he said, adding,
"We of the Pacific must reject, and reject most vigorously, the
thesis that civilizations are destined to collide, especially in
this part of the world."
</P>
<P>
He said that as technology and trade telescope geography and
obliterate borders and as civil society takes root within states
and forges links across boundaries, the imperative to foster
cooperation, mutual understanding and friendship among the peoples
of the Pacific becomes ever more demanding and urgent.
</P>
<P>
"It is time to proceed with the massive building of the bridges
of friendship and understanding not only between governments, not
only between the military and the security agencies, but also
between the many and myriad groupings around which our people
organize themselves and seek fulfillment," he said.
</P>
<P>

academicians, scholars, journalists and corporate figures, from 22
countries and international organizations are attending the

<HEADLINE> Indonesia to Cancel Purchase of F-16s From U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, June 6 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali
Alatas announced here today that his country has decided to cancel
its planned purchase of nine F-16 planes from the U.S. government.
</P>
<P>
Talking to reporters at a Foreign Ministry news briefing,
Alatas said the Indonesian government has also decided to forego
its participation in the Expanded International Military Education
and Training (E-IMET) program offered by the U.S. government.
</P>
<P>
According to Alatas, in a letter dated May 26, 1997, Indonesian
President Seoharto informed U.S. President Bill Clinton of the
decision and cited "wholly unjustified criticism" of Indonesia in
the U.S. Congress as one of the factors that led to this decision.
</P>
<P>
In the letter, Soeharto stressed that the decision was taken
with but one goal in mind, namely to remove any possible stumbling
block that could come in the way of efforts by both countries to
expand and enhance their relationship or that could cause
difficulties to the Clinton administration.
</P>
<P>
With the linkage removed between criticism of Indonesia and its
participation in IMET and the projected purchase of F-16 planes,
the president said, "the relationship between the United States
and Indonesia would move forward to a new and even sounder level
of cooperation based on mutual respect, mutual benefit and
non-interference in each other's domestic affairs."
</P>
<P>
Indonesia has purchased 12 F-16s from the United States but the
sale of the remaining nine the U.S. promised to Indonesia two
years ago has been delayed several times because of human rights
concerns from some members of the U.S. Congress.
</P>
<P>
Alatas said the Indonesian government's decision will not
affect the relations between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
"At present, our relations are very good," he declared.

<P>
The benchmark DSE All Share Price Index slid to 1141.34 points
on Thursday from 1216.68 of the previous week's closing.
</P>
<P>
Following a press report showing Beximco Pharmaceuticals as a
bank defaulter, the traditional market leader on DSE lost 20 taka
(about 0.5 U.S. dollars) per share during the week.
</P>
<P>
Another blue-chip Singer Bangladesh shed by 444.28 taka (about

<HEADLINE> New Electoral System Proposed in Sri Lanka </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, June 6 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lankan Minister of
Constitutional Affairs G.L. Peiris on Thursday presented a new
electoral system to the Parliamentary Select Committee (PSC).
</P>
<P>
Peiris described the new system as a simple electoral system
that makes Parliament reflect the wishes of the people, parliament
sources said today.
</P>
<P>
The proposed electoral system combines the territorial and
proportional representation (PR) systems and will do away with
preferential voting which confused voters and caused rivalry
within parties.
</P>
<P>
According to the proposal, the government will consist of 198
members of parliament, half of who will be elected territorially
on the first-past-the-post basis and the other half under the PR
system, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
Recognized political parties, independent groups and
individuals can contest the territorial seats. Votes cast for
political parties and independent groups will be computed on a
regional basis to determine the PR representation of each party or
independent group.
</P>
<P>
Political parties and independent groups must submit lists of
candidates to be selected under the PR system. The decision to
determine the persons to represent the party will rest with the
secretary of the party concerned.
</P>
<P>
The new proposals also provide for the creation of multiple
constituencies to ensure representation of minority groups or
interests.
</P>
<P>
The PSC will meet on June 13 for a detailed consideration of
the new proposal.

<HEADLINE> Farmers in Nepal Face Shortage of Fertilizers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, June 6 (Xinhua) -- Nepali farmers are facing a
severe shortage of fertilizers this year mainly due to the
decrease in governmental grant assistance, agriculture officials
said here today.
</P>
<P>
Only one third of the farmers, who stand in line every day at a
depot of the Agricultural Input Corporation (AIC) in downtown
Kathmandu these days, could receive fertilizers for their crops,
AIC officials said.
</P>
<P>
The farmers, most of them living at remote villages, have been
facing difficulties in purchasing fertilizers as the AIC's
Kathmandu depot is the only distribution site of fertilizers in
central Nepal.
</P>
<P>
Nepali farmers require some 65,000 tons of urea, 25,000 tons of
D.A.P. and 15,000 tons of potash for the cultivation of their
annual crops, sources here said.
</P>
<P>
According to an AIC official, the sharp deficit of fertilizer
supply this year was caused by several factors -- rising demand,
higher fertilizer prices in international market and the decrease
in grant assistance on fertilizers from the government.
</P>
<P>
A grant assistance of about 33 million US dollars is required
to meet the present annual demand for fertilizers in the country,
he said, adding that only less than one third of the amount has
been received in recent years.
</P>
<P>
The AIC has been purchasing fertilizers at around 250 dollars
per ton but selling at a heavily subsidized rate of more than 120
dollars, incurring heavy loss due to the inadequate government
grant assistance.
</P>
<P>
However, the demand for fertilizers would be met from next
month as 25,000 tons of fertilizers imported by the AIC have
started arriving in the country, the official said.

<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, June 5 (Xinhua) -- Cuba and the United States are
discussing the definitive date and the venue for a new round of
negotiations on migratory matters, the Cuban Foreign Relations
Ministry announced here today.
</P>
<P>
Miguel Alfonso, spokesman for the ministry said there were
choices of venue and there was flexibility.
</P>
<P>
He said the agenda could not be changed because it dealt with
the progress of migratory agreements signed by the two countries
in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Following the last round of talks held here on December 4-5,
1996, the United States announced the return to the island of any
illegal emigrants intercepted on the high seas, or those who
entered the Guantanamo U.S. Navy base.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that an eventual Cuban request for the
extradition of Jose Fernandez Pupo, who hijacked a plane with
violence to take it to U.S. territory, would not be excluded.
</P>
<P>
Alfonso cited the case of Fernandez Pupo, who was acquitted by
a U.S. court despite his confession of the act, as more proof of
who was the main promoter and condoner of terrorism acts.

<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, June 6 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's rice exports declined by
25.43 percent to 1.857 million tons over the first five months
this year compared with the same period last year, according to
Pracha Charutrakulchai, director-general of the Foreign Trade
Department.
</P>
<P>
Pracha was quoted today by local press as saying that the
export drop was brought about the falling world demand for the
grain.
</P>
<P>
Higher rice output of importing countries, such as China,
Indonesia, and Bangladesh, had caused a two-million-ton drop in
the world's rice trade.
</P>
<P>
Pracha predicted Thai rice exports for the year would be well
bellow the target of 5.3 million tons. The new estimate is 4.8
million tons, a monthly average of 400,000 tons, he said.

BANGKOK, June 6 (Xinhua) -- The Stock Exchange of Thailand

disclose the launch of treasure stocks, the local press reported

The new regulation also will allow newly established
subsidiaries of listed firms to acquire their parent firms'
stocks.

<P>
SHANGHAI, June 6 (Xinhua) -- In 1996, even though China's
textile industry lost nine billion yuan, Shanghai's textile sector
turned a profit.
</P>
<P>
The city's strategy to readjust its textile industry has shown
positive results, Vice-Mayor Jiang Yiren told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
Till now, 346 local textile mills have been relocated to
cotton-producing regions in other parts of the country, while 164
went bankrupt, with 340,000 shuttles and 220,000 workers being
laid off, according to the official.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that the city's textile sector now plans to focus on
30 name-brand products, mainly fabrics for industrial use.
</P>
<P>
Local experts observed that the readjustment reflected changes
in the international market and Shanghai's textile industry will
no longer stick to only producing fabrics, but will also act as a
center for textile's import and export, design and information.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai is a major textile base in the country and the ongoing
enterprise restructuring and the booming local economy have paved
the way for the city to further develop the industry, the experts

BELGRADE, June 5 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslavia has achieved remarkable
success in controlling inflation since the country issued the
first government bond at the end of 1995.
</P>
<P>
Up to now, the total value of bonds issued by the country
amounts to 1.27 billion new dinars (about 254 million

</P>
<P>
Yugoslavia has been short of funds since the Bosnian War began

problem, replacing the reckless issue of banknotes. This measure
stabilized the rate of new dinars to U.S. dollars at 5:1.

<P>
The first government one-month short period bond in 1997, which
totalled 50 million new dinars (about 10 million dollars), was

second best time (12:45.09) behind Ethiopian Haile Gebrselassie's
world record of 12:44.39.
</P>
<P>
Komen, who holds the 3,000m world record, was more than three
seconds clear of Moroccan hope Salah Hissou (12:52.39).
</P>
<P>
Christie, who edged Jamaican Michael Green in a photo-finish at
Hengelo last weekend, beat two men this time in another
photo-finish as the 37-year-old sprinted to victory in the 100m.
</P>
<P>
The former world and Olympic champion surged through after a
poor start, but it took a snapshot to separate him from Nigerians
Deji Aliu and Davidson Ezinwa as they hit the line in adjacent
lanes.
</P>
<P>
All three men were credited with a time of 10.20 seconds.
</P>
<P>
However, Christie failed to pull off the double in the 200m as
Fredericks, the double Olympic sprint silver medallist at Atlanta,
powered home for an unstoppable win in 20.24.
</P>
<P>
Belgian Patrick Stevens was a distant second (20.53) and
American Kevin Little third (20.60), with Christie fourth (20.67).
</P>
<P>
Russian Marina Trandenkova won the women's 200m in 22.79, ahead
of Jamaicans Merlene Frazer and Julie Cuthbert. The much heralded
showdown between Merlene Ottey and Gwen Torrence failed to
materialise.
</P>
<P>
Torrence was still in the States nursing an injury, according
to organisers, while world champion Ottey was a disappointing
sixth (23.18).

<HEADLINE> Chinese Children Looking For Their Own Movies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 6 (Xinhua) -- Twelve-year-old Wang Chong enjoys
watching foreign cartoons on TV after school, but seldom goes to
the cinema because there are only adult films and he hasn't had a
chance to see a film about teenagers for the past three years.
</P>
<P>
Xiao Feng, a director of children's films, says that the
children's film system has strongly affected the film business. In
the early '80s, children's film producers could sell as many as
112 copies of a film nationwide, but the same films have hardly
attracted buyers since 1993.
</P>
<P>
To attract a larger audience, cinema managers prefer to show
foreign movies instead of children's films, which makes little
profit. A national survey last year showed that, among the top ten
domestic movies with high box-office receipts, children's movie
came in last.
</P>
<P>
Ozawa, a Japanese director, says that many countries face the
same problem in the children's film industry. In Japan, it's
difficult to get any backing to make children's films.
</P>
<P>
Vinold Ganatta, an Indian children's film producer, says that
India has reduced the number of children's films produced each
year from 15 to just 2.
</P>
<P>
Yu Lan, president of the Chinese Children's Film Society, says
that good movies can be educational and cultural and that Chinese
film producers should not just look for profit, but should produce
more children's films.
</P>
<P>
Dou Chunqi, head of the China Children's Film Studio (CCFS),
says that CCFS, which was founded in 1981, is China's only studio
producing films for children, and has made 224 children's movies,
accounting for a tenth of the country's total.
</P>
<P>
"The film production system has developed a lot in recent
years," Dou, said, and that scripts, camera work, artistry, and
action sequences have all improved.
</P>
<P>
He called on education departments at all levels to help get
primary and middle school students to see children's movies as a
part of their education.

<HEADLINE> Project Hope Helping Children In Northwest China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YINCHUAN, June 6 (Xinhua) -- More than 23,000 children in
northwest China's Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region have returned to
schools, thanks to help from "Project Hope" in the last seven
years.
</P>
<P>
"Project Hope" is a nationwide aid project started in 1989
aiming to raise money for primary school children who have dropped
out of school in poverty-stricken areas.
</P>
<P>
Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, one of the country's poorest
regions, concentrated on eight poverty-stricken counties in the
Xihaigu region, and more than eight million yuan (about one
million US dollars) was raised for the project, financing the
establishment of 75 primary schools.
</P>
<P>
With the help of the project, small libraries have established
in 240 primary schools. The project has also awarded 66 primary
schools in mountainous areas for their outstanding achievements in
developing primary school education under tough conditons.
</P>
<P>
According to official sources, the region plans to help another
60,000 school drop-outs and to set up 150 primary schools in the
next two or three years.

TAIYUAN, June 6 (Xinhua) -- North China's Shanxi province has
intensified its crack-down on drug crimes since the beginning of
the year after increasing amount of drug trafficking in recent
years has aroused its attention.
</P>
<P>
In a period of two months, the province had crashed 809 gangs,
including 63 alleged drug trafficking gangs with 350 members.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, various public security organs had dealt with

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 6 (Xinhua) -- Highlights of today's major
Beijing-based newspapers:
</P>
<P>
 "People's Daily"
</P>
<P>
-- The People's Bank of China (PBC) issued yesterday a circular
prohibiting banks from using funds for the stock market in any way.
</P>
<P>
The central bank ordered all commercial banks to halt all
involvement in trusts, investments and stock businesses within ten
days.
</P>
<P>
Inter-bank borrowing and lending for trust and investment
companies, security dealers, and other non-banking institutions
must come under the strict supervision of PBC branches, the
circular says.
</P>
<P>
-- The newspaper hailed the PBC decision by publishing an
editorial carried by the Financial News. The editorial criticized
the wrong doing that some securities companies and enterprises
made secret deals with a few banking institutes to speculate on
stock trading with credit funds from banks.
</P>
<P>
"Xinhua Daily Telegraph"
</P>
<P>
-- Chinese Premier Li Peng said here today that the further
development of Sino-Italian relations is helpful for the
establishment of a world pattern featuring multi-polarization and
a just and rational new international order for politics and
economy.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese leader made the remark during his talks here
yesterday with Italian Prime Minister Romano Prodi.
</P>
<P>
-- Deng Xiaoping has left abundant and valuable ideological
wealth to the Chinese people and his theory of building socialism
with Chinese characteristics should continue to be practiced,
Chinese leader Qiao Shi urged recently.
</P>
<P>
Qiao, a member of the Standing Committee of the Political
Bureau of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee,
made the remarks during an inspection tour in Shanxi Province in
the north.
</P>
<P>
"China Daily"
</P>
<P>
-- The central People's government has decided to establish the
"Office of the Commissioner of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of
the PRC in the HKSAR" in Hong Kong on July 1, 1997. Ma Yuzhen was
appointed as the Commissioner.
</P>
<P>
-- The second trade fair of Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation

<HEADLINE> Fast-food Trays Recycling on Beijing's Top Agenda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 6 (Xinhua) -- Producers and sellers of
polystyrene food trays in Beijing are being required to collect
and recycle used and discarded trays.
</P>
<P>
This was publicized in a notice issued by the Beijing Municipal
Environmental Protection Bureau and the Beijing Industrial and
Commercial Administration early this month.
</P>
<P>
The notice requires up to 30 percent of the trays to be
recycled by 1998. The percentage should increase to 50 percent by
1999 and 60 percent by 2000, said today's "China Daily".
</P>
<P>
It also says all producers and sellers of these environmentally
unfriendly food containers should apply for registration at the
Beijing Municipal Environmental Protection Bureau before the end
of this month.
</P>
<P>
After examination and approval from both bureaux in charge of
environmental conservation and industrial and commercial
administration, producers and sellers can start their business,
the notice said.
</P>
<P>
Units and individuals are not allowed to produce or sell these
trays without permission from the bureaux.
</P>
<P>
Food trays should be retrieved at a certain percentage within
time limits or permission will be invalid.
</P>
<P>
Producers should be responsible for reducing pollution caused
by these food trays which do not decompose easily, said Zhao
Yixin, director of the Beijing Environmental Protection Bureau, at
a press conference on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
There is a grace period between the publication and
implementation dates of the notice. This allows producers to work
out plans for retrieving food trays and starting experiments.
</P>
<P>
Discarded polystyrene package materials make up three percent
to four percent of the capital's total daily garbage. It takes
years for these plastic bags, food trays and membranes for
agricultural use to decay.

<HEADLINE> Art Theft Ring Smashed in Italy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, June 5 (Xinhua) -- Thousands of artifacts, paintings,
statues and bronzes robbed from archeological sites and private
homes worth five billion lire (about 3 million U.S. dollars) have
been recovered by police after they smashed a ring of art thieves
operating between Italy and Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
Raids conducted by police over the past few months have led to
the recovery of over 1,000 archeological artifacts including
vases, lanterns, reliefs, marble heads, and capitals dating from
prehistoric, archaic, Hellenistic, Etruscan and imperial Roman
times, Associated National Press Agency (ANSA) reported today.
</P>
<P>
Police also found hundreds of art works from between the ninth
and nineteenth centuries.
</P>
<P>
Some days ago, police were able to bring the stolen goods back
to Italy. Investigators said it was the first time that art works
that had been stashed in a Swiss free port zone had been
repatriated without subject to strict customs controls.

<HEADLINE> China to Check If Figures Correctly Add Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 6 (Xinhua) -- China is to launch a nationwide
inspection this month of the implementation of the State
Statistics Law, "China Daily" reported today.
</P>
<P>
The move, to be conducted by the State Statistics Bureau, the
Ministry of Supervision and the Legislative Affairs Bureau under
the State Council, is aimed at tackling inaccurate and even false
social and economic figures which appear in some areas.
</P>
<P>
"The move is aimed at curbing and correcting the illegal
practice of putting out incorrect economic figures, and improving
the quality of statistics," Chinese Vice-Premier Zou Jiahua was
quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Statistics should play a better role in decision-making, Zou
said, calling on governments and departments at all levels to pay
close attention to the inspection and take the work seriously.
</P>
<P>
The inspection should help create a sound social climate for
statistics work by spreading information about the law, he said.
</P>
<P>
China adopted the State Statistics Law in 1984 and revised it
in May last year.
</P>
<P>
"We should keep a sober mind as illegal practices which violate
the Statistics Law still exist," the vice-premier said.
</P>
<P>
Some grassroots units and officials deliberately put out false
statistics to exaggerate their achievements to paint a rosy
picture before the public and their superiors for personal reasons.
</P>
<P>
China launched two inspections on the law's implementation in
1989 and 1994 respectively.
</P>
<P>
In 1994, more than 60,000 cases involving crooked officials and
company bosses had been found breaking the law and tempering with
economic figures.
</P>
<P>
"The inspections proved successful in implementing the law,"
Zou said.

HAVANA, June 5 (Xinhua) -- Cuba is advancing more every day
towards a sustainable development despite its enormous economic
limitations, says Ricardo Sanchez, Vice Minister of Science,
Technology, and Environment.
</P>
<P>
A bill on the environment being drafted in accordance with the
environmental problems of the island, and possible solutions, is
being given the finishing touch, Sanchez said today.
</P>
<P>
The finish of a study on the island's biological diversity,
reflecting in detail the status of the different components of the
biosphere in the Cuban archipelago, was one of the advances in the
care of nature.
</P>
<P>
He said a chapter dwelling on the role of the state and its
organs in environment and natural resources protection was added
to Article 27 of the constitution.
</P>
<P>
The constitution recognized, after the Summit of the Earth held
in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil in 1992, the linking between economic
and social development with sustainability and without detrimental
effects on the environment.

<HEADLINE> China's First Cellulose Ferment Production Line </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YINCHUAN, June 6 (Xinhua) -- China's first cellulose ferment
production line went into operation today in the Ningxia Hui
Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
This puts an end to the country's long reliance on imports
from abroad. According to a local source, cellulose ferment is a
kind of active biological catalyst which can transform rich
cellulose resources into energy, chemicals, and feed products.
</P>
<P>
Cellulose ferment is widely applied to breeding, textiles,
food, brewing, environmental protection, and bio-engineering.
</P>
<P>
The production line was built at a cost of 11.5 million yuan,
and has a designed annual production capacity of 1,000 tons of
cellulose ferment with annual output value forecast at over 80
million yuan.

<HEADLINE> Hingis and Majoli Reach French Open Final </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, June 5 (Xinhua) -- World number-one Martina Hingis and
Iva Majoli of Croatia ensured a teenage women's singles final at
the French Open after taking the semi-finals on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The 16-year-old Hingis survived an intense, big-hitting
cliffhanger against three-times champion Monica Seles and came
back after dropping the first set to record 6-7 (2/7), 7-5, 6-4
victory.
</P>
<P>
Ninth-seeded Majoli, who is three years older, ignored a severe
cold and a sleepless night to edge nervously past South Africa's
iron-willed Amanda Coetzer 6-3, 4-6, 7-5.
</P>
<P>
The two matches were complete contrasts.
</P>
<P>
Hingis and Seles, who have been there before, rose
magnificently to the occasion and kept the crowd on the edge of
their seats with a superbly dramatic encounter which could have
gone either way.
</P>
<P>
Majoli and Coetzer, bidding for a first-ever berth in a Grand
Slam final, clearly suffered stagefright -- although they, too,
kept the crowd in suspense.
</P>
<P>
Seles, the winner here in 1990, 1991 and 1992, went down with
all guns blazing against the top-seeded Hingis -- her powerful
baseline groundstrokes sometimes leaving the Swiss player looking
groggy.
</P>
<P>
But Hingis, who was unable to play any tournaments for six
weeks immediately before arriving in Paris after needing an
operation on her knee following a riding accident, still found the
space to slot a series of screaming winners which left Seles
gasping.

<P>
SHANGHAI, June 6 (Xinhua) -- Chase Manhattan Bank, the largest
commercial bank in the United States, recently opened a Shanghai
branch, in China's financial center.

after a long period of absence, it became the first
American agent for the Bank of China in 1973.
</P>
<P>
Currently, the bank has branches in Hong Kong and Tianjin, and
an office in Beijing.
</P>

<HEADLINE> hke Rubiera Wins 19th Stage at Tour of Italy Cycling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, June 5 (Xinhua) -- Spaniard rider Jose Luis Rubiera went
it alone in the mountains on Thursday to take the 19th stage of
the Tour of Italy as leader Ivan Gotti recovered from Wednesday's
slip to extend his advantage overall to more than 90 seconds with
two stages left.
</P>
<P>
Gotti, who lost 14 seconds to main rival Pavel Tonkov in
Wednesday's time-trial, gained 55 seconds on the Russian over
Thursday's six hill climbs covering 222 kilometres in the
Dolomites, stretching his overall lead to one minute and 32
seconds.
</P>
<P>
But the day belonged to 24-year-old Rubiera. The Spaniard
joined a large breakway after the second hill before producing a
sustained surge that the other riders simply couldn't live with.
</P>
<P>
He crossed the line over three minutes in front of a group of
four -- the Italian trio of Gotti, Roberto Conti and Giuseppe
Guerini, and Colombian Jose Jaime Chepe Gonzalez Pico.
</P>
<P>
Tonkov, who fell on the fourth hill, lost touch with Gotti and
Guerini after they attacked 55km from the finish. Guerini's
performance lifted him to third overall.
</P>
<P>
Frenchman Luc Leblanc and Kazakhstan's Alexandre Shefer, third
and fourth overall at the start, pulled out during the stage, both
evidently suffering from their falls the previous day.

have been laid off find new jobs.

<HEADLINE> German Bavarian State Premier Meets Visiting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MUNICH, Germany, June 5 (Xinhua) -- State premier of the German
state of Bavaria, Edmund Stoiber, met with visiting Chinese leader
Li Ruihuan here today.
</P>
<P>
Li, chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's
Political Consultative Conference, said he is very glad to start
his seven-day official goodwill visit to Germany from Bavaria, a
state which plays an important role in Sino-German relations.
</P>
<P>
He said it was late Bavarian State Premier Franz Joseph Strauss
who took the lead in visiting China as early as 1975, which paved
the way for the development of relations between China and
Germany, as well as between China and Bavaria.
</P>
<P>
Today, many Bavaria-based large companies have engaged in close
cooperation with China while numerous small- and medium-sized
enterprises in the state have also established business ties with
China, Li said.
</P>
<P>
He added he hopes that with joint efforts, the relations
between China and Bavaria will grow further.
</P>
<P>
Stressing that China is a country of great importance in the
world, Stoiber said he was deeply impressed by China's economic
development when he visited China two years ago.
</P>
<P>
He also expressed the hope that the cooperation would be
strengthened between Bavaria and China's Shandong Province, which
have established sisterly relationship.
</P>
<P>
With unique cultural traditions, Bavaria, the largest German
federal state, has not only well-developed agriculture and
traditional industries, but also boasts many new industries
including aviation and space industries, electronics, and
automobile.
</P>
<P>
China will on June 7 open in Munich, capital of Bavaria, its
second consulate general in Germany, which Li said will play an
important role in promoting the relations between China and
Bavaria.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 5 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Defense Secretary William
Cohen said today that Joseph Ralston remained a leading candidate
for chairman of the military Joint Chiefs of Staff despite an
adulterous affair 13 years ago.
</P>
<P>
Cohen said in a strong statement that Ralston was still among
the top candidates he was considering for the post and he would
make a recommendation to President Bill Clinton within two weeks.
</P>
<P>
"General Ralston was a leading candidate before I learned of
these events in his past and he is still a leading candidate. If I
recommend General Ralston to the president I will do so in full
confidence of his character and leadership," Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
Air Force Gen. Ralston this week disclosed to Cohen in response
to media inquiries that he had had an affair with a civilian woman
while he was a colonel and separated from his first wife 13 years
ago.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued today, Ralston, vice chairman of the
joint chiefs, said he took "full responsibility for my conduct
some years ago," and thank Cohen for confidence in choosing him
despite the affair.
</P>
<P>
Ralston, 53, who was traveling in former Soviet states in
Asia, gave no indication he will withdraw as a possible candidate
to succeed Army Gen. John Shalikashvili this year.

<HEADLINE> Rubins: Revoking MFN to China Means to Isolate U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 5 (Xinhua) -- Revoking normal trade relations
with China would do harm to U.S. strategic interests and Isolate
the United States, Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin warned on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Rubin was making the remarks at a U.S.-China Business Council
meeting as a few lawmakers expressed their oppositions to
President Bill Clinton's decision of renewing the Most Favored
Nation (MFN) trade status for the coming year.
</P>
<P>
"Revoking normal trade relations, which some have proposed,
would fundamentally undermine our ability to advance our economic
and national security interests," he said.
</P>
<P>
"In our judgement revoking normal trade relations with China is
absolutely the wrong way," he emphasized.
</P>
<P>
Rubin said denial of the MFN trade status, the normal trade
treatment, for China would hurt U.S. consumers, undermine U.S.
interests in the Asian-Pacific region and harm efforts to promote
stability in Hong Kong after its returning to China on July 1.
</P>
<P>
"Severing trade ties with China will not isolate China. It will
isolate the United States. It will also lead other nations in Asia
to question our commitment to the region," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Revoking normal trade relations with China would also harm
Hong Kong in the name of supporting it," he continued.
</P>
<P>
Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky told reporters after
speaking to a different group that members of Congress understood
the dangers of being the only nation in the world to sever
economic ties with China.
</P>
<P>
"There is in the House a growing appreciation that to cut off
MFN is to isolate ourselves with China," Barshefsky said. "That
really is the only effect of cutting off MFN."

<HEADLINE> UK to Allow Divorcees to Share Pensions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 5 (Xinhua) -- British Social Security Secretary
Harriet Harman said today her government will allow divorced
couples to divide up pensions.
</P>
<P>
"I will introduce pension-sharing for divorcing couples. This
is an important step towards meeting the government's objectives
of improving the income of women in retirement," Harman said in a
written reply to the parliament.
</P>
<P>
"It is the combination of the basic state pension and a decent
second pension which prevents people from retiring into poverty.
But women are less likely than men to have a good second pension,"
she added.
</P>
<P>
The move will end the existing system whereby a divorcee can
only claim a share of an ex-partner's pension when that pension is
taken. But the new plan is unlikely to become law until the year
2000.
</P>
<P>
Harman said her proposals "will lead to fairer treatment of
pensions in financial settlements between divorcing couples and
will provide a better and more secure income in retirement for
those receiving a share of pension rights."

satisfy immigration officials about their motives for marriage.
</P>
<P>
Home Secretary Jack Straw said today in a written reply to the
House of Commons that the rule will be scrapped immediately.
</P>
<P>
"Following our manifesto commitment, we are acting to end the
primary purpose rule because it is arbitrary, unfair and
ineffective and has penalized genuine, divided families and
unnecessarily increased the administrative burden on the
immigration system," he said.
</P>
<P>
But Straw said other rules on married partners applying to
enter Britain -- that the marriage was not one of convenience and
would not place a financial burden on the state -- would remain.
</P>
<P>
The rule has been criticized in Britain for the past years. The
interior ministry said the rule was ineffective and unfair and it
has placed a burden on the partners of Britons that was not placed
on other European Union nationals and should therefore be
scrapped.

<HEADLINE> UK Launches Training of Compliance Officers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 5 (Xinhua) -- "Compliance in Futures and Options"
the first major course created by the Futures and Options
Association (FOA) was launched at the Fourth International
Derivatives Conference here today.
</P>
<P>
The objective of the course is to develop the interpretative
and commercial reasoning of the compliance professional.
</P>
<P>
It aims to provide newcomers to the field of derivatives
compliance with a sound, broadly based understanding of the
ethical and regulatory requirements of the industry and focuses on
the acquisition of practical skills.
</P>
<P>
Compliance is the newest profession in Britain. Prior to the
advent of the Financial Services Act in 1988, most of the firms in
UK financial services would not have recognized the title
"Compliance Officer", an official from FOA said.
</P>
<P>
Ten years on, firms are recognizing that "legal and accounting
qualifications" are not in themselves enough, and there is a
growing realization that some form of training, leading in due
course to a qualification, is necessary, the official added.
</P>
<P>
The course will enable newhands to gain skills to deal with the
wide range of issues that may arise within an authorized firm
involved in both on and off-exchange derivative business.
</P>
<P>
Following the launch, Anthony Belchambers, Chief Executive of
the FOA said: "The attention given to regulators in the UK has
sometimes obscured the importance of the front-line regulator --
the Compliance Officer in firms."
</P>
<P>
"This course, created by the industry for the industry,
demonstrates the coming of age of the compliance profession and
fills an important gap in the training of those engaged in the
front line of regulation," he added.
</P>
<P>
The course will begin in September at Queens' College,
Cambridge, with candidates completing exams before Christmas.

<HEADLINE> Rising US Economy Leaves Behind Many People </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 5 (Xinhua) -- Although the U.S. economy is in
the strongest growth in a decade and the unemployment rate the
lowest in a quarter-century, many people were left behind and have
a hard time to find a job.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. unemployment rate has averaged 5.2 percent this year
and was down to 4.9 percent in April, the lowest since December
1973. But the good times are not good for everyone. For instance,
in the District of Columbia, the U.S. capital, the jobless rate
averaged 7.6 percent in the past four months.
</P>
<P>
Joblessness is especially higher for city dwellers than for
suburbanites, higher for teens than for adults, higher for blacks
than for whites. And, among blacks, it's significantly higher for
young men than for young women.
</P>
<P>
For whites nationally, the jobless rate average is 4.4 percent;
for blacks, 10.6 percent. For adults aged 25 to 54, it's 4.1
percent; for youth 16 to 19, 16.6 percent. For teen-age black
females, it's 27 percent; for teen-age black males, 39.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
Why the big gap? Some obvious reasons are reported by U.S. new
media.
</P>
<P>
Ineffective public schools and lack of financial help for
college played a role. Unemployment rates are higher for the
youngsters with less experience and education.
</P>
<P>
Many inner-city residents in the U.S., isolated by poor public
transit systems, also find it takes too long or costs too much to
reach thriving suburbs, where sales jobs are more plentiful.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, racial discrimination persists. Black applicants
received unfavorable treatment in 20 percent of job searches
compared with 7 percent of white applicants, according to some
studies, using pairs of identically qualified black and white male
college students in Chicago and Washington.
</P>
<P>
Judging by unemployment rates, teen-age black males suffer more
from discrimination than young black women. The trend can be
partly explained by a shift away from manufacturing and blue
collar jobs toward clerical, sales and service.

<HEADLINE> European Shares Higher </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 5 (Xinhua) -- All major stock markets in Europe
ended higher today.
</P>
<P>
British shares finished higher for the first time in seven
sessions as renewed bid speculation swirled around the dealing
rooms in London's financial district. A firmer look to Wall Street
also gave the market a much needed boost. The FTSE-100, which had
dropped in the previous six trading days, ended 19.1 points up to
4,576.2.
</P>
<P>
In Frankfurt, German shares posted minor gains amid relief that
the Bundesbank and Bonn seemed close to reconciliation in their
spat over asset revaluation, easing fears of a soft start for
monetary union. The 30-share DAX ended the bourse session up 11.19
points at 3,673.03 points.
</P>
<P>
French shares close more than two percent higher, bolstered by
relief at the composition of France's Socialist-led government.
The CAC-40 index closed up 55.48, or 2.11 percent, at 2,690.85.
