<HEADLINE> Religious Leaders Meet in Beijing  (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 11 (Xinhua) -- Visiting American religious
leaders met with their Chinese counterparts today to discuss
issues of common concern.
</P>
<P>
Rabbi Arthur Schneier, president of the Appeal of Conscience
Foundation, Archbishop Theodore McCarrick of the Newark Roman
Catholic Archdiocese and Reverend Don Argue, president of the
National Association of Evangelicals, and their party are visiting
China as guests of the Chinese People's Institute of Foreign
Affairs.
</P>
<P>
Bishop Fu Tieshan briefed the American delegation on the history
and the current status of Catholicism in China.
</P>
<P>
China is currently home to 115 Catholic diocese, 5000-odd
churches, more than 1000 priests and over four million Catholics,
according to Bishop Fu, who also serves as president of the Chinese
Catholic Patriotic Association (CCPA).
</P>
<P>
Approximately 60,000 people are baptized into the Catholic
faith annually, according to the bishop.
</P>
<P>
Fu recounted the 700-odd year history of Catholicism in China,
and noted that the spread of the religion has been suited to
Chinese culture and local customs.
</P>
<P>
Bishop Fu voiced anxiety about the problem of aging amongst the
Catholic clergy. He held that the CCPA should devote itself to the
management of seminaries so as to train more young clergymen in
philosophy and theology.
</P>
<P>
The CCPA operates 31 seminaries which have trained more than
900 priests over the past two-odd decades.
</P>
<P>
CCPA Vice-President Liu Bonian told the American visitors that
a group of young bishops have completed their education and are
preparing to assume positions. He said that Catholicism will
witness a period of still more rapid development over the next ten
years.
</P>
<P>
Archbishop McCarrick volunteered to help train teachers for
China's seminaries.
</P>
<P>
Schneier expressed encouragement about charities organized by
the CCPA and asked about efforts to educate children.

<HEADLINE> Egyptian President: Military Threat Against Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, February 11 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
Wednesday observed that there appears no relaxation of a military
threat against Iraq as the U.S. is augmenting its military
presence in the Gulf.
</P>
<P>
"What I fear is Iraq coming under a strike for failure to
implement the (U.N.) resolutions. And no one would then be able to
prevent the U.S. from mounting such a blow," Mubarak told
reporters on the possibility of a military option.
</P>
<P>
He made the statement to reporters after hour-long talks with
Iraqi Foreign Minister Mohammed al-Sahhaf who arrived here
Wednesday morning to drum up Arab support for avoiding threatened
U.S. military strikes.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has been subjected to U.S. threat of military action over
its denial of full access to the U.N. arms inspectors to its
presidential sites suspected of hiding lethal weapons, and its
demand for a re-formation of the inspection teams.
</P>
<P>
"I see a large military buildup already in place," he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the president also denied mass media reports that
there is a collective Arab initiative to solve the Iraqi crisis.
</P>
<P>
"Such initiative should emanate from all the Arab states and
this did not happen," Mubarak told reporters, adding he received
no word on such an initiative and that there is no tendency at
present to hold even a limited Arab summit.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi foreign minister told reporters here Wednesday that
Iraq has agreed to open eight presidential sites to international
arms inspectors appointed by the U.N. Secretary General.
</P>
<P>
He explained that "When we say eight we are actually talking
about all the sites," in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Amidst diplomatic efforts by Russia, France and the Arab
League, a proposal for a solution has been taking shape, which
allows U.N. inspectors access to the eight presidential palaces
and 60 other sites.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak said he told Sahhaf the situation is grave and the
Security Council resolutions should be executed so as to avoid any
aggravations.
</P>
<P>
Asked if he had felt a flexible Iraqi stand following his
meeting with Sahhaf, Mubarak said "I told him all I wanted and the
decision is theirs."

<HEADLINE> EC Searches for Way out of SRM Impasse </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, February 11 (Xinhua) -- The European commissioners
held a round-table debate on Wednesday in an attempt to iron out
the remaining difficulties surrounding the implementation of the
European Union's ban on specified risk materials (SRM).
</P>
<P>
They had to deal with this thorny issue as a full team now that
France announced on Monday that it had reversed its earlier
decision not to comply with the union's directive on the treatment
of SRMs.
</P>
<P>
The commissioners discussed the persistent resistance to the
treatment of SRMs, that are certain categories of livestock offal
that present a high risk of infection from Bovine Spongiform
Encephalopathy or madcow disease.
</P>
<P>
The resistance comes from Germany, Austria, Denmark, Finland,
Spain and Greece that have formally applied to the European
Commission for TSE-free status.
</P>
<P>
TSE is transmissible spongiform encephalopathies that include
BSE and scrapie in sheep.
</P>
<P>
All six countries are actually demanding a de facto exemption
from the SRM ban and they have threatened to block all BSE-related
legislation until the commission provides assurances that their
applications for TSE-free status are treated seriously.
</P>
<P>
A proposal can become an EU legislation only after all the 15
European Union member states agree upon it.
</P>
<P>
The six countries emitted their threat in relation to
Australia's and New Zealand's application for TSE-free status,
which was indefinitely shelved by the European Union Standing
Veterinary Committee.
</P>
<P>
The commissioners also discussed about the long-running dispute
with the United States over its EU-bound exports of tallow-based
pharmaceuticals that are worth 4.5 billion U.S. dollars a year.
</P>
<P>
The tallow-based pharmaceuticals, under a strict interpretation
of the SRM ban, will have to be suspended altogether.
</P>
<P>
The American side has protested in the strongest possible terms
and underlined its opposition last December by suspending all
imports of live ruminants and ruminant meat from the European
Union on the grounds that it could no longer ignore their inherent
risk of BSE infection.
</P>
<P>
The European Commission, the executive body of the 15-nation
union, had planned to implement the SRM ban on January 1 this year
but had to postpone it till March 31 under opposition from both EU
member states and third country trading partners.
</P>
<P>
The one-day debate seemed not enough to help remove the
uncertainty still hanging on the SRM ban.

Bishop Fu acknowledged that Chinese children from Catholic
families receive education mainly from their parents and
grandparents.
</P>
<P>
Liu referred to the difficulties Catholicism is currently
facing in China, and noted the government's tolerant polices on
religion. However, he pointed to the fact that the Vatican's
failure to establish direct relations has been unbeneficial to
Catholicism in China.

MOSCOW, February 11 (Xinhua) -- A Russian IL-86 special
aircraft carrying a Duma delegation and humanitarian cargo left
for Iraq from Ereven, the capital of Armenia on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Aboard the plane were 12 tons of relief supplies and 32 people,
including nine Duma (parliament) deputies, 15 reporters and eight
people accompanying the cargo.
</P>
<P>
The plane, which had been waiting on the ground in Armenia
since Sunday, won permission for the flight from the United
Nations' Iraqi sanctions committee Wednesday morning, said the
Interfax news agency.
</P>
<P>
The plane's departure was delayed because there is a national
holiday in Iran, Interfax cited the State Duma Chairman Gennady
Seleznyov as saying.
</P>
<P>
Head of the Duma delegation to Iraq, Vladimir Zhirinovsky,
Wednesday morning tried to get a maximum possible number of
deputies, journalists and other people onto the plane. But the
U.N. committee restricted the number of people aboard.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Russian Regions parliamentary group issued a
statement expressing grave concern over the Iraqi situation.
</P>
<P>
However, it said the populist show staged by the Liberal
Democratic Party, leader Vladimir Zhirinovsky has nothing to do
with standing up for Russia's national interests.

<P>
SHANGHAI, February 11 (Xinhua) -- A group of 40 adopted
disabled orphans and their foster families gathered today at a
restaurant in Shanghai to celebrate the last day of this year's
Spring Festival.
</P>
<P>
Chinese tradition calls for family members to gather for a
"reunion dinner" on the last day of Spring Festival with a good
end. The event enabled the orphans and their foster families to
enjoy precious family warmth.
</P>
<P>
The families have adopted handicapped orphans since May 1997
under the joint sponsorship of the Shanghai Municipal Civil
Administration Bureau, Xin Ming Evening News and Shanghai Charity
Fund.
</P>
<P>
The foster parents regard the disabled orphans as their own
children and have rendered loving care over the past nine months.
</P>
<P>
Li Hongfang, 45, a foster mother who used to work as a
kindergarten teacher, said: "I adopted an orphan because I know
that parental love overcomes loneliness."
</P>
<P>
The adopted children have undergone great change, with their
average heights increasing by 3.62 centimeters and weights by 1.1
kilograms.
</P>
<P>

HONG KONG, February 11 (Xinhua) -- "The full moon hanging in
the sky tonight not only symbolizes Hong Kong's return to the
motherland, but also predicts a bright future of the special
region," said Chan Loo Shan here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Chan, 38, together with his four-member family, was among the
thousands of people who flocked to the Ko Shan Park and Theater
Wednesday evening, where they could have a glimpse of the gigantic
lantern and enjoy a variety of entertainment programs in
celebration of the traditional Chinese Lantern Carnival.
</P>
<P>
Besides marveling at the eight-meter lantern called "Blossoming
Flowers in Celebration of Spring," the crowd took part in free
programs including Chinese comic talk shows and concerts by
renowned Guangdong Music Company from Guangzhou and an exciting
traditional stage art show by a famous local troupe.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the switching-on ceremony, Chairman of the
Provisional Urban Council's Entertainment Select Committee
Christina Ting Yuk-chee said that the local government is glad to
celebrate the Spring Lantern Festival together with the public on
this festive occasion.
</P>
<P>

 Chinese traditional dances performed by the Hong Kong Dance
Company and Hong Kong Folk Dance Troupe as well as romantic
Chinese opera excerpts by Ching Fai Cantonese Opera College were
offered inside Ko Shan Theater.
</P>
<P>
In addition, visitors spent a joyful evening participating in
different activities including lantern corridor exhibition,
lantern riddle games, Chinese calligraphy, grasshopper-making and

<HEADLINE> Iraq Urged to Respond to Tension-Defusing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, February 11 (Xinhua) -- Foreign ministers of the
six-member Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) Wednesday urged Iraq to
respond positively to the international efforts aimed at defusing
the current crisis over weapons inspection.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued following their extraordinary meeting
here, the GCC foreign ministers said "the current crisis is a
direct result of Baghdad's reluctance to cooperate with United
Nations inspectors and its determination to defy the will of the
international community with respect to the elimination of its
arsenal of weapons of mass destruction."
</P>
<P>
The GCC, a regional political and economic organization
established in 1981, groups Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab
Emirates, Oman, Bahrain and Qatar.
</P>
<P>
The ministers said the Iraqi regime was required to implement
the will of the international community represented by the U.N.
Security Council.
</P>
<P>
They deemed as unacceptable the Iraqi unilateral actions which
led to the current Iraqi-U.N. standoff.
</P>
<P>
They also reiterated their support for diplomatic efforts to
defuse the tension.
</P>
<P>
Kuwaiti Crown Prince and Prime Minister Sheikh Saad Al-Abdullah
Al-Sabah said at the opening ceremony that "keen on the safety and
security of the region and aware of the dangers of Iraq's
challenges and the possible consequences that might result from
other options, we have all expressed support" for the international
efforts to find a diplomatic solution.
</P>
<P>
On the U.N. economic sanctions, the ministers held Iraqi
leadership responsible, saying in the statement that "the only
solution to spare the people of Iraq additional hardship and
dangers is the Iraqi regime's implementation of the
U.N. resolutions which it had previously accepted."
</P>
<P>
They also stressed their keenness on the territorial integrity
and sovereignty of Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The emergency meeting was mooted by Kuwait in view of growing
tension Iraq and the United States.
</P>
<P>
The crisis was triggered by Iraq's denial of free access to
U.N. arms inspectors its presidential sites suspected of hiding
weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
The United States has threatened to resort to force against
Iraq if the current diplomatic efforts fail to end the
confrontation.
</P>
<P>
The GCC leaders called on Iraq to cooperate fully with the
U.N. Special Commission in charge of eliminating Iraqi weapons of
mass destruction and comply with all the U.N. resolutions.
</P>
<P>
They also expressed deep concern over the growing tension
between Iraq and the U.N. as a result of Iraq's continued attempts
to conceal biological and chemical weapons.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Opposition Challenges Land </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, February 11 (Xinhua) --The Zimbabwean opposition
National Democratic Union (NDU) today lodged an application in
the Supreme Court, challenging the government's recent
designation of commercial farms for compulsory acquisition under
the controversial land resettlement scheme.
</P>
<P>
In the application, NDU President Mark Muchabaiwa cites
Minister of Lands ane Agriculture Kumbirai Kangai as the
respondent in his capacity as the Administrator of the Land
Acquisition Act.
</P>
<P>
The NDU application follows the designation late last year of
more than 1,400 commercial farms for compulsory acquisition,
mostly owned by the country's 4,500 white farmers.
</P>
<P>
The land acquisition act and the constitution require full
payment of compensation for property acquired by the state, but
the government said it would only compensate for improvements
without considering the value of the land.
</P>
<P>
NDU is seeking an interdict suspending of the whole
designation exercise until the compensation ratio is agreed upon
and rationalised.
</P>
<P>
''It is also important to note the manner in which the
exercise is being carried out is in clear violation of the
citizen's constitutional rights to their property and their
rights to seek recourse to the law in case of a dispute with the
government,'' the party said in the application.
</P>
<P>
The government is determined to resolve the situation of
imbalance of the land. At present, less than one present of the
country's population, the white farmers, owned about 70 percent
of the land.
</P>
<P>
Last week, President Robert Mugabe said his government was
trying to resolve the land issue in a peaceful and orderly
manner.

<HEADLINE> Spokesman: Iraqis Determined to Defend Country </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, February 11 (Xinhua) -- Iraq Wednesday stressed that
the Iraqi people are determined to maintain the integrity,
sovereignty and independence of their country.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi people are also ready to defend themselves against a
possible military attack launched by the United States, a
spokesman of the Ministry of Culture and Information told the
Iraqi News Agency.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman was commenting on a recent statement by British
Foreign Secretary Robin Cook, that any possible U.S. attack on
Iraq might lead to Iraq's partition which Britain would welcome.
</P>
<P>
Cook "expresses the odious strategy of partition which has been
championed by British imperialism in dealing with the Third World
nations over the last two centuries," the Iraqi spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
"Cook seems to be still taking a pre-Second World War view of
his country's prestige and is still dreaming an effective colonial
role for it, forgetting that Britain no longer has a role in
international politics but a subordinate to the U.S.," he added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Saad Qassem Hammoudi, chairman of the Arab and
International Committee of the Iraqi National Assembly, slammed
U.S. Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott for calling on jamming
Iraqi radio networks and addressing American radio transmissions
to the Iraqi people.
</P>
<P>
"We find it strange for a senior parliamentary official to talk
with such a logic which implies a trend hostile to the rights of
man and democracy simultaneously," Saad Hammoudi said.
</P>
<P>
This means that Lott is seeking to deny the human and sovereign
rights of the Iraqis to express views at home and attempting to
impose enemy's views on the Iraqi people, he added.

<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, February 11 (Xinhua) -- The Nepali government has
launched a poverty alleviation project in eight districts of
western Terai, the official RSS news agency reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The project aims to enhance the income generation of the small
farmers, the landless and underprivileged women, take ahead the
targeted persons toward sustainable development by organizing them
in small groups and strengthen the financial efficiency of the
financial bodies engaged in providing loan services for
sustainable development, the RSS said.
</P>
<P>
The project is being implemented by adopting the concept of
group development which is considered successful in the developing
countries, the news agency said.
</P>
<P>
A total of 107,805 people will benefit from the project during
a seven-year period, the agency said.
</P>
<P>
The project will cost some 9.73 million U.S. dollars. The
International Fund for Agriculture Development agreed last
December to provide a loan of 8.87 million dollars, while the rest
will be covered by the Nepali government, the beneficiaries and
Nepal's Agriculture Development Bank, the RSS said.

<HEADLINE> Canada's New Motor Vehicle Sales Up in December </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, February 11 (Xinhua) -- Canada's new motor vehicle
sales posted their strongest monthly gain of the year in December,
lifting annual sales to their highest level since 1989, Statistics
Canada reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In December, 144,555 new motor vehicles were sold in the
country, up 14.6 percent from November and 32.8 percent from a
year ago.
</P>
<P>
Vehicle dealers "might have drawn some January business into
December by offering their customers strong incentives on the
purchase of new motor vehicles," the statistics agency suggested.
</P>
<P>
This shift in sales, coupled with the ice storm in Quebec and
Eastern Ontario provinces, will cause new motor vehicles sales to
drop drastically in January, 1998, it said.
</P>
<P>
Canada's new motor vehicle sales have been on the rise since
April 1996 following a year of relatively flat sales.

<HEADLINE> Secondhand Smoke Causes Ear Infections of Children </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, February 11 (Xinhua) -- A major Canadian study has
found that children can get painful middle-ear infections from
second-hand smoke at home.
</P>
<P>
Children who lived with two or more smokers for their first
three years were shown to have an 85-percent higher risk of
developing the infection than those who were not exposed to smoke,
according to the study done by University of Calgary researchers.
</P>
<P>
Preschoolers whose mothers smoked more than 10 cigarettes a day
showed a 68-percent higher chance of suffering from the disease,
whose symptoms include pain, loss of sleep and temperature
spiking.
</P>
<P>
In Canada, about 13 percent of middle-ear infection among urban
children stems from passive smoking.
</P>
<P>
These findings have been published in the American Medical
Association Archive of Pediatrics &AMP; Adolescent Medicine, the Globe
and Mail newspaper reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Middle-ear disease can lead to short-term or long-term hearing
loss, slow language development and other serious complications,
the paper said.
</P>
<P>
A total of 625 Grade 1 pupils from 36 schools were involved in
the study, the most thorough and representative of a series of
North American studies that sought to establish whether there is a
link between secondhand smoke and ear-infections.

<HEADLINE> S. Leonean Ministers Flee to Guinea, Eecomog </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, February 11 (Xinhua) -- As heavy fighting continues at
the outskirts of the Sierra Leonean capital Freetown, some of the
ministers of the military government have escaped to neighboring
Guinea, the Nigerian defense headquarters said this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Quoting an ECOMOG source in Freetown, Nigeria's Department of
Defense Information said the ministers "disguise as refugees and
join other people who are fleeing for safety".
</P>
<P>
The number of the fleeing ministers was not disclosed.
</P>
<P>
Since the fighting broke out between the junta forces and the
west African peacekeeping force known as ECOMOG last Thursday,
about 1,000 people have reportedly fled Freetown to Guinea.
</P>
<P>
The defense headquarters also slammed the propaganda antics by
the junta that the ECOMOG troops are killing innocent civilians.
</P>
<P>
The allegations "are false and without foundation", the
defense headquarters said in a press released signed by Fodwin
Ugbo, Acting Director of Defense Information.
</P>
<P>
"The people's army and the RUF (Revolutionary United Front, a
former rebel group allied to the junta after the May 25 coup last
year) fighting for the junta are without military uniforms. They
wear civil dress and mix with civilians when carrying out their
nefarious activities," it said.
</P>
<P>
Accusing the junta of equally concentrating their arms and
ammunition, especially missiles and anti-aircraft weapons in
civilian areas, the defense headquaters said the ECOMOG troops
have been very conscious to avoid firing on these areas.
</P>
<P>
"The junta have also resorted to looting and molesting
innocent civilians as the ECOMOG troops are closing towards
freetown," it said.
</P>
<P>
"The ECOMOG High Command believes that peaceful negotiation to
restore the legitimate government of President Alhaji Kabbah can
stop these hostilities," it added.
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian-led ECOMOG is in Sierra Leone to enforce
sanctions and embargo imposed on the junta by west African
countries and the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that the sub-regional force is advancing
towards the center of Freetown after the capture of some
"strategic areas" in the suburbs.
</P>
<P>
The military pressure is seen to aimed at forcing the junta to
follow the peace accord signed between the junta and west African
countries in the Guinean capital of Conakry last October.
</P>
<P>
Under the plan, the junta is to quit power on April 22 this
year.
</P>
<P>
The latest intense fighting has forced the close-down of
banks, shops and schools in Freetown and the fleeing of local
residents to neighboring countries, especially Guinea.
</P>
<P>
A United Nations refugee agency spokesman was earlier quoted
as saying that Guinea has become home to some 250,000 Sierra
Leonean refugees, most of who fled after the first coup in 1991.
</P>
<P>
Some 80,000 of them fled after the coup last May, according to
the U.N.High Commissioner for Refugees.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Reaffirms Ban on Fireworks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 11 (Xinhua) -- Beijing, the Chinese capital,
reaffirmed the ban on fireworks and instructed related departments
to strictly enforce related regulations during today's
celebrations of the traditional Lantern Festival.
</P>
<P>
A city official denied rumors that the municipal government
will relax controls on fireworks. Related regulations, approved by
the Standing Committee of the Municipal People's Congress, have
been in effect since 1993.
</P>
<P>
An increasing number of Beijingers violated regulations by
discharging fireworks during this year's Spring Festival, the
Chinese lunar New Year's day.
</P>
<P>
The cancellation of fireworks ban in some cities,
including Luoyang and Hangzhou, sparked rumors about relaxed
regulations in the Chinese capital.
</P>
<P>
The official attributed the increasing number of cases of the
illegal use of fireworks to lax monitoring by the related
departments and the approved use of fireworks in suburban areas
since last year.
</P>
<P>
Local public security departments have fined 350 Beijingers for
related violations, with an additional 17 people detained for the
illegal use of fireworks.
</P>
<P>
Over 300,000 yuan (37,500 US dollars) worth of illegal
fireworks have been confiscated, according to official figures.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing Environmental Protection Agency reported the
average noise level during this year's Spring Festival exceeded
the state-set standard of 55 decibels for the first time since
initiation of the ban five years ago.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing Fire Department reported 236 fires during the
Spring Festival holidays from January 28 to February 1. Of them,
59 cases were attributed directly to fireworks.
</P>
<P>
"The figure was significantly larger than in the previous
year," said an official in the fire department.
</P>
<P>
A survey of Beijing's major hospitals revealed that more people
were injured by fireworks during this year's Spring Festival than
in previous years.
</P>
<P>
Local newspapers report that 24 Beijingers were seriously
injured by fireworks last week, with at least nine losing their
eyesight.

<HEADLINE> German Insurance Giant Allianz Posts Big Profit Gains </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, February 11 (Xinhua) -- Germany's largest insurance group
Allianz Wednesday announced a pre-tax profit of 4.95 billion marks
(2.72 billion U.S. dollars) for 1997, up nearly 19 percent from a
year ago.
</P>
<P>
Allianz today also reported a group turnover of 85.3 billion
marks (46.9 billion dollars) in 1997, up 14 percent from the 1996
level.
</P>
<P>
For 1998, Allianz expects its turnover to increase by nearly
four percent to 88 billion marks (48.4 billion dollars), with
profit expected to grow faster than turnover again.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Allianz's planned takeover of the third largest
French insurer Assurances Generales de France SA (AGF) would also
add some 26 billion marks (14.3 billion dollars) to the German
group's total turnover, making it the largest insurer in the
world, the company said.

<HEADLINE> International Seminar on Rights of Disabled Opens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, February 11 (Xinhua) -- A three-day international
seminar on the U.N. rules on disability began here Wednesday to
discuss ways to guarantee the disabled the same rights as the
able ones.
</P>
<P>
More than 30 participants from member states of the African
Rehabilitation Institute, the International Labor Organization
and the International Disability Foundation are attending the
meeting.
</P>
<P>
The seminar came in the wake of a growing realization that the
situation of the disabled had not changed much despite the
declaration of the world program of action 10 years ago.
</P>
<P>
Third world countries in particular had not protected the
right of the disabled persons due to various reasons related to
the absence of disability policies.
</P>
<P>
In her opening address, Zimbabwean Public Service, Labor and
Social Welfare Minister Florence Chitauro said the plight of most
disabled people in Africa had not changed much.
</P>
<P>
She said that African countries should do more to learn how to
effectively support the implementation of U.N. policies to
improve the lot of people who had been marginalized for a long
time.
</P>
<P>
President of Pan African Disabled Federation Khalfa Khalfa
called on the African governments to keep have the disabled
people in mind when formulating development policies.
</P>
<P>
He criticized governments for leaving needs of the disabled to
charities.
</P>
<P>
"This is a wrong concept," he said, adding "UN instruments on
disability clearly state that it is the responsibility of the
governments to see that people with disabilities have access to
and enjoy all facilities being enjoyed by the able bodied."
</P>
<P>
Some of the major issues to be discussed include creating
health care opportunities for women with disabilities and the
roles played by international and regional organizations in the
promotion of international disability standard rules.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe to Phase out Tariffs on Imports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, February 11 (Xinhua) -- A senior Zimbabwean official
Wednesday called on companies to be prepared for external
competition as the government plans to phase out tariffs on
imports.
</P>
<P>
Industry and Commerce Minister Nathan Shamuyarira said most
companies had in the past been shielded from imports.
</P>
<P>
"I would like, however, to inform you that my ministry will
soon be undertaking an exercise with a view to phasing down
tariffs. This means that the protection that existed before will
now be progressively scaled down," he said.
</P>
<P>
The present tariff regime, announced last February, protected
local manufacturers by levying duties of between 40 and 85
percent on finished imported products.
</P>
<P>
The minister also said the government had passed the bill
establishing the competition commission, which seeks to cushion
the local industry threatened by unequal external competition.
</P>
<P>
The commission also aims to curb abuse of monopoly power,
prevent restrictive business practices, sanction mergers and
remove barriers to entry into any economic activity.
</P>
<P>
"I would like to take this opportunity to draw the attention
of those who are operating in a monopolistic situation to be
aware that henceforth their action will continuously be monitored
by the watchdog to ensure that all practices are promotive of the
general public of our citizens," he said.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks officially opening a Dunlop depot and
distribution center in Harare.

<HEADLINE> DHKKI in Greece Opposes Military Strike Against Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, February 11 (Xinhua) -- Greece's Democratic Social
Movement (DHKKI) Wednesday expressed its opposition to the use of
military force against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters after his meeting with Iraqi Consul Hazan
Altayar, DHKKI leader Dimitris Tsovolas said that the current
Iraqi crisis with U.N. arms inspectors should not be settled by
resorting to force, but by peaceful means and through diplomatic
channels.
</P>
<P>
He added that it was unacceptable for the Iraqi people to pay,
with a years-long embargo, the designs of the major powers and
their economic interests in the Gulf.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Greek government spokesman Dimitris Reppas said
Wednesday that the activity at the air bases on the Greek island
of Crete was usual and it was in no way related to developments in
the ongoing Iraqi crisis.
</P>
<P>
The aircraft of foreign countries whose final destination was
Cyprus had passed through the airports at Souda and Heraklion, he
added.
</P>
<P>
The Greek government has insisted that the Iraqi crisis should
be resolved peacefully while U.N. Security Council's resolutions
be implemented by Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
Greece says that Washington has so far not yet requested
military assistance or facilities from Athens and it will not
participate in the possible military action against Iraq.

<HEADLINE> Russian Plane Arrives in Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, February 11 (Xinhua) -- A Russian plane carrying an
eight-member delegation headed by Russian Liberal Democratic Party
leader Vladimir Zhirinovsky arrived Wednesday at the Saddam
international airport.
</P>
<P>
The plane, with the Russian State Duma (lower house of
parliament) delegation and a number of Russian reporters on board,
carried eight tonnes of medicine and medical appliances.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi National Assembly (parliament) last week invited the
Russian State Duma to pay visit to its presidential sites, and the
latter accepted Iraq's invitation.
</P>
<P>
The Russian plane, Ilyushin-86, arrived in the Armenian
capital Yerevan Sunday night and was stranded there for two
days before getting a U.N. clearance to fly into Iraq
</P>
<P>
The U.N. clearance for the plane to continue its flight did
not come until Tuesday evening when Zhirinovsky agreed to reduce
the number of people on the plane from some 200 to 31.
</P>
<P>
Under relevant U.N. resolutions, foreign planes to Iraq are
banned after the 1991 Gulf War unless they get clearance from the
U.N. Sanctions Committee.
</P>
<P>
Zhirinovsky last visited Baghdad in December with a plane
carrying humanitarian goods to Iraq with the sanctions committee's
exceptional grant.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Stresses Crisis Can Only Be Resolved by Iraq's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, February 11 (Xinhua) -- The current crisis over
UN weapons inspection in Iraq can only be resolved by Iraq's full
compliance with the relevant resolutions of the Security Council
of the United Nations, U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Bill
Richardson stressed here today.
</P>
<P>
Richardson was responding to reports that Iraqi Foreign
Minister Mohammed Saeef Al-Sahaf had announced in Cairo Wednesday
Iraq supports a Russian proposal to allow U.N. weapons inspections
of all Iraqi sites in order to avoid a military strike.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters, the U.S. Ambassador said," We do not
think there should be any deals or compromises. We feel very
strongly that there should be clear and unfetered access to all
sites by UN inspectors and that the integrity of the United
Nations Special Commission(UNSCOM) should be maintained."
</P>
<P>
"We think the Russian and French proposals are very serious and
well-intentioned. We have reservations about any proposal that
dose not fully comply with UN Council resolutions," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The Problem can only be resolved by Iraq's full compliance
with the resolutions of the Security Council," Richardson
stressed.

<HEADLINE> Egypt: Iraq Closer to Implementing UN Resolutions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, February 11 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Presidential Advisor
Osama el-Baz said Wednesday that Iraq is edging closer to
implementing the U.N. resolutions, the Middle East News Agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
Iraq was "inching closer to implementing these resolutions,"
Baz said after Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak met with Iraqi
Foreign Minister Mohammad Saeed el-Sahhaf who arrived here
earlier in the day.
</P>
<P>
El-Sahhaf told reporters after the meeting that Baghdad has
agreed to open eight presidential sites to international arms
inspectors appointed by United Nations Secretary General Kofi
Annan.
</P>
<P>
He explained that "when we say eight we are actually talking
about all the sites" in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Baz declined to rush to any judgement on whether the
U.S. would reject Iraq's proposal to resolve the current crisis
over the arms inspection between Iraq and the U.N.
</P>
<P>
"We await the crystallization of the final stances of both
parties concerned," he said, voicing hope that the gap would be
bridged soon.
</P>
<P>
On reports that the chances of a diplomatic solution to the
Iraq crisis are ebbing, Baz advised against jumping to that
conclusion.
</P>
<P>
"We have to wait for some time," he said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. who is strengthening military build-up in the Gulf has
threatened that it would attack Iraq to force it to grant
unfettered access to the U.N. arms inspectors to all sites if
international diplomatic efforts fail to achieve positive
results.

LONDON, February 11 (Xinhua) -- The British government is
considering to give life jail sentence to those who deliberately
pass on the AIDS virus or other life-threatening illnesses, local
reports said.
</P>
<P>
The Interior Ministry published a consultation paper on
Wednesday aimed at updating British laws to cope with incidents in
which people have been injected with syringes containing the HIV
virus, which causes AIDS.
</P>
<P>
The Terrence Higgins Trust AIDS charity welcomed the explicit
differentiation in the proposals between deliberate and accidental
transmission of any disease.
</P>
<P>
"It is the very rare case of deliberate infection which should
be an offence. What is essential is that the law is clear and not
open to malicious misuse," said the trust's chief executive, Nick
Partridge.
</P>
<P>
The consultation paper will be distributed to lawyers, health
workers and other interested parties for discussion before any law
is framed.

<HEADLINE> EU Opens Info Center on Central, Eastern Europe Aid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, February 11 (Xinhua) -- The European Union on
Wednesday opened an information center in Brussels to help
publicize its assistance programs to central and eastern Europe.
</P>
<P>
The information center is aimed at responding more effectively
to information requests about the Phare and Tacis programs from
both the business sector and interest groups.
</P>
<P>
Hans van den Broek, European commissioner in charge of external
relations, attended the opening ceremony of the information
center.
</P>
<P>
The Phare assistance program was initially designed to support
the central European countries in their transition toward market
economy and is now the principal financial instrument for
enlargement.
</P>
<P>
The Tacis assistance program aims to develop harmonious and
prosperous economic and political links with the newly independent
states (NIS) in central and eastern Europe.
</P>
<P>
Mongolia is also included in this aid program.
</P>
<P>
Together, these two assistance programs have committed almost
10 billion ECU for central and eastern European countries.
</P>
<P>
The European Union had set up a smaller information office in
1991 and opened this new information center to deal with the ever
growing demand for information.
</P>
<P>
Last year alone, the old office received an estimated 5,000
visitors and dealt with more than 50,000 letters, faxes, telephone
calls and E-mail messages and gave some 120 presentations.
</P>
<P>
The new center offers personalized assistance and Internet
access as well as documentation.
</P>
<P>
The European Union is central Europe's main trading partner and
by far the main provider of bilateral assistance with a budget of
6.693 billion ECU between 1995 and 1999.
</P>
<P>
The EU is also a major trading partner and main provider of
bilateral assistance to the NIS with a commitment of 3.3 billion
ECU between 1991 and 1997.

<HEADLINE> Britain to Introduce Random Drug Tests for Drivers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 11 (Xinhua) -- Britain said on Wednesday it
would introduce random roadside drug tests after evidence showed
that drug-influences driving poses a major safety threat.
</P>
<P>
Figures published by the Transport Department showed that 18
percent of drivers killed in accidents had traces of illicit or
medicinal drugs in their bodies, which was far greater than
previously suspected.
</P>
<P>
"What this would do is allow (the police)...to do a quick 'yes
or no' for the presence of drugs at the roadside which then means
they can make a much more informed arrest," said Roads Safety
Minister Baroness Helene Hayman.

Under present rules officers who think a motorist is under the
influence of drugs have to arrest the suspect, take them to a
police station and ask for a blood or a urine sample. But now a
few strokes across the forehead with a new testing kit will be
enough to detect illegal substances.
</P>
<P>
Pilot tests will start next month and will be voluntary because
police do not yet have the power to force drivers to cooperate.
</P>
<P>
Officials said the number of people taking drugs and driving
has soared in recent years. One study found that 85 percent of
young drivers in Scotland considered it usual to drive under the
influence of drugs.

<HEADLINE> Israel Paints Better Picture of Palestinian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 11 (Xinhua) -- Israel Wednesday tried to
paint a better picture of the Palestinian economy in 1997, while
pledging to make more efforts to ease Palestinian lives.
</P>
<P>
Briefing reporters on the economy of the Palestinian self-rule
areas, Yaacov Orr, coordinator of the Government Activities of
Israel in the Occupied Territories, said that in 1997 more
Palestinians were permitted to work in Israel and more Palestinian
merchants and trucks were allowed to travel between the Gaza Strip
and the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
The days of closure of the Palestinian self-rule areas by
Israel were reduced to 63 days in 1997 from 92 days in 1996, the
number of Palestinians working in Israel increased to 47,000 from
39,000 and Palestinian businessmen entering Israel rose to 6,300
from 3,400, Orr said.
</P>
<P>
He added that the number of Palestinian trucks travelling
between the Gaza Strip and the West Bank, and to Jordan and Egypt,
increased to 15,178 last year from 11,962 in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Orr attributed the better situation of the Palestinian economy
to the efforts made by Israel to increase the free movement of
personnels and goods despite repeated terror attacks.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli coordinator listed several Israeli measures to
minimize the impact of security operations on the Palestinian
economy.
</P>
<P>
He said that Israel has decided to allow 3,000 Palestinian
workers at present to stay overnight in Israel even during time of
closure; the quota of Palestinian workers allowed to enter Israel
has remarkably been increased; and the passage of workers and
goods mainly from Gaza has been greatly simplified.
</P>
<P>
He promised that Israel would make more efforts, through
consultations with the Palestinian National Authority (PNA), to
further improve the Palestinian economy.
</P>
<P>
He said a better mechanism would be set up to further simplify
the passage of personnels and goods, and the number of Palestinian
workers working in Israel would also be gradually increased
despite the security risk.
</P>
<P>
Israel would also support to establish industrial parks for the
PNA, he added.

<HEADLINE> No Rift Valley Fever in Ethiopia, Says Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, February 11 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopian Minister of
Health Adem Ibrahim said Wednesday that epidemic occurrence in
the Somali and Afar regional states do not have any connection
with the rift valley fever which struck some of its neighbors.
</P>
<P>
The Ethiopian News Agency quoted the minister as saying that
no trace of the rift valley fever has been seen altogether in
Ethiopia so far.
</P>
<P>
The minister said the epidemic is a malaria which surfaced as
a result of the overflow of river Wabi Shebele following untimely
downpours.
</P>
<P>
Upon notification by the regional administration, he said, his
ministry dispatched health teams to places in the regional states
where the incidence of the epidemic was said to have been high
and that curative measures were also carried out.
</P>
<P>
Adem said, one team led by himself along with a representative
from the World Health Organization (WHO) visited Kebridehar,
Gode, Mustahil, Ferfer in the Somali regional state and some far
off areas in the Afar regional state.
</P>
<P>
The other noticeable health hazards are tuberculosis, measles,
dysenteryr as well as malnutrition, he said, adding that his
ministry is helping the regional states in every way possible to
put the epidemic under control.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, WHO representative Wedson Mwambazi said that the
situation is not so acute, but chronic. He pledged WHO's supports
in the efforts of the ministry to bring the epidemic under
control, according to the report.

<HEADLINE> British Bases in Cyprus Not on War Alert: Spokesman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, February 11 (Xinhua) -- British military bases in
Cyprus are not on war alert due to the situation in Iraq as
reported by the local press, a spokesman for British forces in
Cyprus said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
But there was an increased number of military planes stopping
there on their way to the Gulf for the past few days, Mervyn Wynn
Jones said.
</P>
<P>
"There have been a number of extra flights passing through, on
their way to the Gulf, from a variety of places," he said.
</P>
<P>
Local press reports have said that the southern British
military base of Akrotiri and the Episkopi Garrison have been put
on war alert due to the situation in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Jones told Cyprus News Agency that "it would be a complete
exaggeration to say that we are on war alert."
</P>
<P>
A British Defense Ministry spokesman was reported to reveal
two weeks ago that part of the personnel on the bases in Cyprus
have already been put on alert of a certain degree, due to the
situation in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
"The same happens in all bases, including those in Britain
itself," he was quoted by Cypriot mass media as saying, adding
"the degree of alertness may increase according to developments."
</P>
<P>
The reports about British military bases on alert were made
following a tension in the Gulf where the U.S. has reinforced its
military presence, threatening to use force against Iraq if it
does not allow U.N. weapons inspectors to enter all sites.
</P>
<P>
Britain has retained two sovereign military bases in Cyprus
since 1960 when the island gained independence from British
colonial rule.

<HEADLINE> Somali Commercial Ferry Capsized in Red Sea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, February 11 (Xinhua) -- A Somali commercial ferry
with more than 5,000 head of goats and its crew men is reported
to have capsized in the Red Sea last week.
</P>
<P>
The ship which sailed from the town of Berbera in northwestern
Somalia on February 3 is reported to have sunk in the Red Sea
close to the Kamaran island of Yemen.
</P>
<P>
Reports reaching here Wednesday said a tag boat belonging to
the Yemeni government has rushed to the rescue of the ship and
managed to save all the people aboard the vessel. Nevertheless,
all the livestock on the ferry are reported to have died.
</P>
<P>
A report said there has been no hope for the recovery of the
vessel as it sunk deep into the sea with all its livestock.
Somali businessmen have estimated the loss of the goats to more
than 300,000 U.S. Dollars, a serious economical setback for some
Somali businessmen.
</P>
<P>
This vessel is one of the dozens of ships busy in exporting
Somalia's livestock from the ports of Berbera and Bossaso to the
Arabian Gulf countries despite the ban imposed on Somalia's
animal exports to this region owing to an alleged sickness that
hit Somalia and Kenya following the disastrous floods in the past
few months.
</P>
<P>
Many Somalis and doctors deny the existence of the disease now
known as the Rift Valley Fever. The Somalis, wherever they are
including the local authorities in the self proclaimed Republic
of Somaliland, have asked for an international team to probe the
allegations.

<HEADLINE> US Civilian Team Arrives in Jordan en Route to Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, February 11 (Xinhua) -- A nine-member team of
U.S. civilian organization, Voice in the Wilderness arrived here
Wednesday en route to Baghdad to send medicine to Iraq in defiance
of U.N. sanctions on the country.
</P>
<P>
Over 110,000 U.S. dollars worth of medicine and medical
supplies were carried by the team for children's hospitals in
Iraq, team member Martin Thomas told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
The Chicago-based volunteer organization wanted to help lift as
soon as possible the economic sanctions imposed on Iraq since its
invasion of Kuwait in 1990, said team head Kathy Kelly.
</P>
<P>
"The most dramatic way (to help ease the sanctions) is that we
be there," she added.
</P>
<P>
The nine members risked 12 years in prison and a fine of 1
million dollars for carrying medicine to Iraq without
authorization, according to a press release from the team.
</P>
<P>
However, Kelly insisted that all the members had no fear so
long as their work could help ease the suffering of the Iraqi
people.
</P>
<P>
"Iraq is almost ravaged by the sanctions," said Kelly, while
showing some facts collected by her colleagues who visited the
country earlier.
</P>
<P>
She added that the sanctions were due to the U.S. who wants to
guarantee its interests in the region's oil resources.
</P>
<P>
Kelly said that her organization also condemned "any further
military strikes against the people of Iraq" and called for
"diplomatic solutions" to the current standoff between Iraq and
the U.N..
</P>
<P>
"We urge the leaders of all parties involved in the current
crisis to work toward immediate lifting of the economic sanctions
as it is the only way to solve the most pressing crisis in Iraq as
well as the suffering of the Iraqi people," the team's press
release said.
</P>
<P>
The team is scheduled to leave for Baghdad on Thursday and
they are now waiting for visas from the Iraqi Embassy in Jordan.
</P>
<P>
The current trip had been the eleventh of such kind conducted
by Voice in the Wilderness since January 1996. The latest one
took place in last December when four men visited Iraq for more
than a week.
</P>
<P>
Up to now, Voice in the Wilderness has dispatched more than
600,000 dollars worth of medicine and medical supplies to Baghdad
through sending teams there, said Kelly.

<HEADLINE> UNICEF Warns of Alarming Prospects for Children in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, February 11 (Xinhua) -- A United Nations official
warned here today that the prospects for children would be
alarming on the eve of the 21st century if current trends of
drying up aid continue.
</P>
<P>
The industrialized countries are far behind in their commitment
to help developing nations eradicate poverty, said Carol Bellamy,
Executive Director of the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF).
</P>
<P>
She mentioned a report made public today in Brussels by the
21-nation Development Assistance Committee (DAC) of the
Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) to
support her point of view.
</P>
<P>
The OECD report said that Official Development Assistance (ODA)
from DAC member countries totaled 55 billion US dollars in 1996, a
six percent decline over the year before. As a share of the
combined donors' Gross National Product (GNP), ODA fell to 0.25
percent in 1996, the lowest level since the UN set an ODA target
of 0.7 percent of GNP in 1970.
</P>
<P>
The figures confirm earlier findings that ODA has fallen to its
lowest levels ever, Bellamy pointed out.
</P>
<P>
"UNICEF"s analysis of the DAC numbers shows that if the current
rate of decline persists, ODA will literally vanish by the year
2015," she said. "It is hard to imagine that as an eventuality,
but that is where the numbers point."
</P>
<P>
"This is a moral issue, and a legal imperative," said the
UNICEF executive director. "Under the Convention on the Rights of
the Child, the most universally embraced human rights instrument
in history, children have a fundamental right to the fulfilment of
their basic needs."
</P>
<P>
If all donor countries had met the UN target of earmarking 0.7
percent of their GNP for development aid, Bellamy said, ODA would
exceed its current levels by 100 billion dollars a year, an amount
that, over 10 years, would be more than enough to ensure universal
access to basic social services, including health and nutrition,
education, and low-cost water supply and sanitation.

NAIROBI, February 11 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan President Daniel arap
Moi appealed Wednesday for inter-ethnic harmony in Nakuru and
Laikipia districts in west Kenya where more than 100 people were
killed in ethnic clashes since January 11.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in Njoro, Rift Valley Province, Moi directed regional
and community leaders to maintain peace in the clash-torn areas,
the Kenya Television Network reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Kenyan leader called on leaders of the Njoro and Laikipia
areas to ensure peace and security in the area disregarding their
political affiliations.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that a series of clashes had taken place in
the area between ethnic Kalenjins and Kikuyus, killing more than
100 Kenyans in the past month.
</P>
<P>
More than 50 Members of Parliament from the ruling Kenya
African National Union (KANU) accused opposition leader Mwai
Kibaki, chairman of the Democratic Party, and other
oppositionists of inciting violence in Rift Valley Province.
</P>
<P>
Local observers said many of the early victims of the
month-long violence appeared to be Kikuyus, but up to now the
Kalenjins have accounted for half of the death toll.
</P>
<P>
About 700 Catholics Wednesday marched through the center of
Nairobi and held a special mass in the city's Uhuru Park to press
for peace in the Rift Valley Province.

<HEADLINE> Chirac Explains to Bosnia President Plavsic Visit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, February 11 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac
Wednesday sent a letter to his Bosnian counterpart Alija
Izetbegovic to explain the visit to France by the president of
Bosnian Serb republic, Biljana Plavsic.
</P>
<P>
Izetbegovic has protested the high-level welcoming ceremony
granted to Plavsic by Chirac on Monday in the Elysee presidential
palace on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Chirac said in his letter that he asked Plavsic to help the
return of refugees to their home villages and contribute to the
strengthening of the central government of Bosnia, Agence
France-Presse quoted French diplomats in Sarajevo as saying.
</P>
<P>
The French president described the response of Plavsic as
"positive and encouraging for the future."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a French Foreign Ministry spokeswoman has expressed
astonishment over the protest by Bosnian president over the visit
by Plavsic.
</P>
<P>
"We have learnt with astonishment the communique of the
(Bosnian) presidency which presented in a wrong way the position
of France toward Bosnia and its motive in receiving Madame
Plavsic," said the spokeswoman Anne Gazeau-Secret.
</P>
<P>
While calling on Bosnia to "lift" its misunderstanding toward
France, the spokeswoman said that France wishes to reinforce
"relations of friendship and cooperation with the state of
Bosnia-Herzegovina, of which Republika Srspka makes up an
entity."
</P>
<P>
President Chirac gave Plavsic a welcoming ceremony for a head
of state at the Elysee Palace Monday morning.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time for Plavsic to have received such
high-level welcome from a foreign country.
</P>
<P>
Bosnian President Izetbegovic said in a communique that he was
"deeply offended" by the treatment given by France to Plavsic.
</P>
<P>
France said that it received Plavsic in order to support the
forces in favor of peace among Bosnian Serbs and to isolate
ultra-nationalists and war criminals.
</P>
<P>
Paris also wishes to encourage Bosnian Serbs to continue an
opening policy and contribute to the building of a pluralistic and
democratic country in Bosnia.

UNITED NATIONS, February 11 (Xinhua) -- UN Secretary-General
Kofi Annan today expressed his serious concern over the
deteriorating humanitarian situation in Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
In a statement, Annan said he was concerned at reports that
heavy shelling in Freetown is posing serious risks for the safety
of civilians and that some staff of humanitarian organizations
have been preventing from evacuating.
</P>
<P>
The UN chief said he was also concerned at reports of rapidly

goods as a matter of life-saving urgency.
</P>
<P>
Annan said the United Nations supports the goals of the Conakry
Agreement of 23 October 1997, that is, the surrender of power by
the junta in order to ensure a peaceful reestablishment of the
constitutional order in the country and the improvement of the
humanitarian condition of its people.

<HEADLINE> Jerusalem Police on Death of Jewish Student </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 11 (Xinhua) -- Jerusalem police suspected
that terrorism might be involved in the murder of a Jewish
religious student earlier Wednesday, Israel Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
The 30-year-old student was stabbed on his way to a Synagogue
in the Ramat Shlomo neighborhood in northern Jerusalem at about
5:00 a.m. local time. No one witnessed the attack, only a woman
reportedly heard the shouting of the victim.
</P>
<P>
A large presence of Israeli police forces were deployed in the
area and around the city immediately after police received the
report. Roadblocks were also set up at main roads as part of the
man-hunt for the murderer.
</P>
<P>
While refraining from ruling out the possibility of criminal
act, Jerusalem police chief Yair Yithzaki and national police
Inspector-General Yehuda Wilk both said the attack seemed to be a
terrorist act.
</P>
<P>
They noted that there has been a rise in attacks against
Jewish religious students in Jerusalem recently. In last November,
a student was shot dead in the Muslim quarter of the Old City in
East Jerusalem by a suspected Palestinian militant.
</P>
<P>
Two weeks ago, another Jewish religious student was seriously
wounded after being stabbed by a Palestinian woman in the Old
City on his way to the West Wall to pray; last Thursday, a Jewish
student was also stabbed by an Arab attacker near the Old City;
and on Tuesday, an Israeli border patrol arrested a Palestinian
woman carrying a knife, who claimed to be on her way to carry out
an attack.
</P>
<P>
Since last November's attack, Israel has beefed up police
presence in the Old City by setting up more police stations
there.
</P>
<P>
East Jerusalem has been at the center of Israeli-Palestinian
dispute as Israel has claimed its sovereign control over the
whole city, while the Palestinians wants the occupied East
Jerusalem to be the capital of a future independent state.
</P>
<P>
Also Wednesday, a Palestinian youth was also attacked in
western Jerusalem by an unknown attacker. But police said there
was no link between the attack and the earlier incident, saying
the Palestinian man has criminal background.

<HEADLINE> Britain Wants UN to Reach Quick Agreement on Iraqi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, February 11 (Xinhua) -- It was important for
the security Council of the United Nations to adopt a resolution
on the newly proposed oil-for -food plan for Iraq as soon as
possible so as to help the Iraqi people, British Ambassador to the
United Nations Sir John Weston said here today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters, Weston said the original draft had been
amended, presumably to take in some proposals in a rival French
draft, which was now no longer on the table.
</P>
<P>
"It is very important to get one with that resolution. We are
coming in with a slightly amended and consolidated draft
resolution," he told reporters.
</P>
<P>
"We want to get one with that as fast as possible in order to
give the Secretary-General the support he needs for his proposals
and also to bring the help we need to the Iraqi people," he added.
</P>
<P>
The UN chief recommended to increase the amount of the oil Iraq
can sell in every six months from the current 2 billion U.S.
dollars to 5.2 billion dollars. The move is aimed to alleviate the
suffering of the Iraqi People under the UN Sanctions imposed on
Iraq since 1990.

<HEADLINE> Iranian, Egyptian Officials Discuss Iraqi Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, February 11 (Xinhua) -- Iran and Egypt Wednesday
underlined the need for a continued diplomatic effort to avert a
possible U.S. attack on Iraq, the Iranian official news agency
IRNA reported.
</P>
<P>
In a telephone consultation, Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal
Kharrazi and his Egyptian counterpart Amr Moussa discussed the
latest developments of the crisis over arms inspections.
</P>
<P>
Both of them called on Iraq to observe and implement the U.N.
Security Council resolutions, the IRNA said.
</P>
<P>
The crisis was triggered by Iraq's denial of access to the
United Nations arms inspectors charged with eliminating its
weapons of mass destruction to 68 sites, including presidential
palaces.
</P>
<P>
The United States is strengthening military build-up in the
Gulf and says it will attack Iraq to force its compliance with the
arms inspections if international efforts fail to achieve positive
results.
</P>
<P>
In their discussion, Kharrazi and Moussa reviewed the mediation
made by Russia, France and the Arab League, and their proposals
aimed at defusing the crisis.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has reportedly proposed jointly with the three parties
that eight presidential palaces be inspected by a special group,
whose members should include those from the five permanent members
of the U.N. Security Council - France, Russia, China, the U.S. and
Britain.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi Foreign Minister Mohammad Saeed el-Sahhaf reportedly said
Wednesday in Cairo after a meeting with Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak that "when we say eight (presidential palaces) we are
actually talking about all the sites" in Iraq.

transaction.
</P>
<P>
The New York's Long Island-based CA has obtained financing

employees, Wang said.
</P>
<P>
CA is the world leader in mission-critical business software.
The company develops, licenses and supports more than 500

<HEADLINE> COMESA to Reduce Trade Barriers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, February 11 (Xinhua) -- The Common Market for Eastern
and Southern Africa (COMESA) has agreed to implement the COMESA
customs bond guarantee scheme to reduce major costs to shippers,
exporters and importers in a bid to reduce trade barriers in the
region.
</P>
<P>
The scheme is required for transit goods to ensure customs
duties and taxes are recovered by the government of the transit
country in the event of goods being illegally sold within its
territory, according to a statement released here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
It said the current scheme provides that customs guarantees
are arranged in a country where the supplier is resident, unlike
the cumbersome old system where customs bond guarantees for
transit traffic had to be deposited in each transit country.
</P>
<P>
The COMESA customs bond guarantee will enhance the
competitiveness of goods traded within and outside the region
because the costs required by customs transit bonds will be
eliminated.
</P>
<P>
The program is expected to be implemented no later than
October 1, this year, said the statement.
</P>
<P>
The cost of documentation is also expected to be reduced by
about 15 to 20 percent and customs cooperation is expected to be
enhanced among its 20 member states, the statement noted.
</P>
<P>
The COMESA transit trade facilitation program comprises among
others the COMESA yellow card, COMESA carriers license,
harmonized road transit charges and COMESA transit plates.
</P>
<P>
Namibia, Tanzania and Zimbabwe have implemented the COMESA
customs document while other member countries are in the process
of introducing the document.

<HEADLINE> UK Monetary Policy Is Now Finely Balanced: Bank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 11 (Xinhua) -- Record-breaking price
reductions during the New Year sales in Britain sent the cost of
living plunging last month, enabling the Government to hit its 2.5
percent inflation target.
</P>
<P>
The scale of the price discounts in the sales brought the
underlying measure of inflation down to the target for the first
time since the Labor came to power last May.
</P>
<P>
The drop in the price of clothing and footwear last month was
the biggest since 1947, while the price of house-hold goods such
as fridges and furniture recorded the biggest fall since
comparable records began in 1956.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the figures, the Bank of England said on
Wednesday that the UK's monetary policy is now more finely
balanced than at any time over the past five years with output
rising at 3 percent a year and inflation has fallen from 5 percent
to 2.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
But the Bank, which has the power to decide rate, dashed market
hopes that interest rates have peaked by adding the balance of
inflation risks remain to the upside.
</P>
<P>
The Bank said there were a number of inflationary risks -- a
more rapid fall in the exchange rate than that implied by interest
rate differentials, past rapid money growth and, particularly,
pressures in the labor market.
</P>
<P>
It also said, monetary policy is being pulled in opposite
directions. On the one hand, the impact of the rise in sterling on
both exports and imports is likely to slow growth sharply over the
coming year.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, inflation is, at present, temporarily
depressed by the one-off fall in import prices which is masking a
level of domestically generated inflation of over 3 percent,
significantly above the target level.
</P>
<P>
But earnings growth remained at 4.75 percent overall, and
according to the Bank's estimates, over 5 percent in the private
sector.
</P>
<P>
So the Bank warned that earnings growth, especially in the
private sector, will have to fall back if the inflation target is
to be met.

<HEADLINE> UK Pledged to Act on N.Irish Killings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 11 (Xinhua) -- British Northern Ireland
Secretary Mo Mowlam vowed Wednesday to take immediate action if
there was proof any party at the peace talks was connected to two
killings in the province this week.
</P>
<P>
"The government will not hesitate to act if it is deemed that
any party has dishonored the Mitchell Principles," Mowlam told
parliament, referring to the code of non-violence binding
participants in the talks.
</P>
<P>
"There is a great deal of speculation about who is responsible,
but it has not yet been established what happened," Mowlam said.
"When the RUC (police) and the Chief Constable come to me with the
facts, we will act."
</P>
<P>
No group has claimed responsibility for the latest two killings
and the police have not commented on speculation that three men
they have arrested are linked to Irish Republican Army guerrillas
fighting to end British rule in Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
After the two killings over the last 24 hours, seven IRA
suspects were questioned in connection with one of the murders,
local reports said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Wednesday, pro-British Ulster Unionist leader David
Trimble called for the expulsion of Sinn Fein, the political wing
of the IRA, from the peace talks.
</P>
<P>
All parties in Northern Ireland are required under the Mitchell
Principles, named after talks chairman George Mitchell, to commit
themselves exclusively to peaceful and democratic means.

<P>
LONDON, February 11 (Xinhua) -- Share prices in Europe's major
stock markets ended mixed Wednesday, with London slightly down
and Paris surging to another record closing high.
</P>
<P>
Leading British shares in London slipped back into negative
territory as the market tracked a dull showing on Wall Street,
with the FTSE 100 index closing down 5.4 points at 5,607.9 points.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Bank of England's latest quarterly inflation
report which was published Wednesday hinted at another rate hike
to come.
</P>
<P>
It said the risk of inflation is on the increase and the era of
high growth and falling inflation is probably over.
</P>
<P>
The market was led higher by pharmaceutical stocks, but was
dragged down by bank sectors which gave up recent gains and by oil
stocks which fell over fears of lower crude prices.
</P>
<P>
The CAC-40 index in Paris closed only 4.24 points up at
3,240.00, but hit another record high, giving up earlier strong
gains as Wall Street failed to build on Tuesday's record close.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said that declines in banking and oil stocks also
pulled the market back.
</P>
<P>
In Frankfurt, the DAX-30 index ended the session 64.68 points
higher at 4,588.43, as share prices held firm in late trade thanks
to the stronger dollar and Wall Street's overnight record close.

<HEADLINE> Chinese UN Ambassador On Issue of Social Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, February 11 (Xinhua) -- To guarantee social
stability is the highest priority in social development worldwide,
chinese Ambassador to the United Nations Qin Huasun stressed here
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the 36th Session of the Commission for Social
Development on promoting social integration, Ambassador Qin said
from a global perspective, many social problems, such as poverty,
unemployment, drug, ethnic conflict and organized crimes, are yet
to be resolved, and humanity is still faced with grave challenges.
</P>
<P>
Qin said these problem, if not solved at an early date, would
lead to social unrest, or even violent conflict.
</P>
<P>
Qin pointed out when social stability is not guaranteed, social
development is only empty words. Therefore, to ensure social
stability is the highest priority in social development.
</P>
<P>
Noting speeding up economic growth is the prerequisite for
promoting social integrity, Qin said all other rights of the
people of developing countries can hardly be realized if, first
and foremost, their right to have enough food and clothing is not
yet realized.
</P>
<P>
The Ambassador said since countries differ in their political,
economic, social and cultural background, governments should
formulate their policies, measures and programs for the promotion
of social integration in light of their own national conditions.
</P>
<P>
He stressed governments should proceed from the practical
conditions, and formulate and implement policies and regulations
to guarantee, in real terms, their people's rights to participate
in social life.
</P>
<P>
Qin said expanding international cooperation and rich countries
helping poorer ones are indispensable conditions for promoting
social integration. He called for settlement through broad
cooperation of, and joint efforts by, the international community.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Demands "Full and Free" Access by Inspectors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 11 (Xinhua) -- President Bill Clinton
insisted Wednesday that Iraqi President Saddam Hussein must give
U.N. inspectors "full and free" access to suspected weapons sites
in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
"He must let the weapons inspectors back with full and free
access to all suspected sites. If he will not act, we must be
prepared to do so," Clinton said in a speech at the U.S. State
Department.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tareq Aziz earlier Wednesday
offered to open eight "presidential sites" for inspection under
the supervision of representatives of the U.N. Security Council.
</P>
<P>
Before Clinton's remarks on the Iraqi offer, White House
spokesman Mike McCurry said, "The U.N. Special Commission (UNSCOM)
needs free and unfettered access to those sites that it needs to
investigate to determine what capacity Iraq has or could have to
weapons of mass destruction."
</P>
<P>
"It was not up to Iraq to set the conditions for those
inspections. I's up to the United Nations to do the work as the
United Nations sees fit," McCurry told reporters.
</P>
<P>
The United States is determined to force Iraq to abide by the
U.N. resolutions on weapons inspections and has repeated its stand
that if diplomacy failed, it would mount an air strike against
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
"We all hope we can avoid the use of force, but let's face it,
in the end that is up to Saddam Hussein," Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
The United States has already assembled a mighty force in the
Gulf, which has also been augmented by British ships and
warplanes, for a possible attack on Iraq once the diplomacy
engaged by the international community failed.
</P>
<P>
Anthony Zinni, the commander of the U.S. force in the Middle
East said earlier Wednesday that Washington would be ready to
strike Iraq within about a week.
</P>
<P>
"I would say we're within a week or so," he said in the final
hours of a three-day tour of the Gulf with U.S. Defense Secretary
William Cohen.
</P>
<P>
"We're ready now but there are a few more pieces to put in,"
Zinni said. "My biggest concern would be to ensure we have looked
at every possible reaction to a strike and we have sufficient...
plan to handle anything that might come up."

<HEADLINE> Dredging of Dar Harbor Near Completion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, February 11 (Xinhua) -- The dredging of Dar es
Salaam harbor which started in mid-1997 is expected to be
completed by April, Samson Luhigo, director general of Tanzania
Harbor Authority (THA), told reporters Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Luhigo said the progress made by three vessels in dredging up
the entrance to the harbor is "impressing."
</P>
<P>
Widening of harbor entrance will resolve the problem of tide
movement which hold sway over the performance of containers, he
noted.
</P>
<P>
For instance, he said, during the period of tide ebb, a
container whose cargo has already been unloaded may have to wait
because of the limited depth of the harbor.
</P>
<P>
The vessel has blocked the way for others to enter for
discharge of cargo, affecting the handling capacity of the
harbor, the official said.
</P>
<P>
When the 23-million-US-Dollar project is completed, vessels of
up to 40,000 tons will be able to enter the harbor.
</P>
<P>
The project is being carried out by a Dutch firm HAM, with the
Dutch government meeting some 60 percent of the project's cost
while the rest is to be financed by the Tanzanian government.

<P>
BEIJING, February 12 (Xinhua) -- Chinese scientists plan to
conduct clinical research to determine the effectiveness of an
herbal compound for treating acquired immune deficiency syndrome
(AIDS).
</P>
<P>
The preparation, a powder, consists of bupleurum, milkvetch,
Chinese angelica and licorice which dissipate heat and toxic
materials, while improving human immune functions, according to
Doctor Wang Jian from the Chinese Academy of Traditional Chinese
Medicine (TCM). Wang is a member of a Sino-Tanzanian research
group working on the new AIDS drug.
</P>
<P>
Pending formal approval, Wang and his colleagues, both Chinese

patients following the application of medication.
</P>
<P>
The research will also focus on changing quantities of CD4
positive cells and neopterin, two leading indications of human
immuno function.
</P>
<P>
"We hope to achieve reliable and convincing results on the
effectiveness of the medication," said Wang. He stressed that
major criteria for appraising curative effects has been adopted
worldwide.
</P>
<P>
The scientists will introduce AZT, a common anti-HIV drug, in a
control group to provide a comparison.
</P>
<P>
"Research on AIDS treatment with herbal therapies was launched
more than ten years ago. However, Western medical circles failed
to recognize verified results owing to different appraisal
criteria," said Wang.
</P>
<P>
"Bearing these facts in mind, we must introduce the
aforementioned criteria," according to Professor Guan Chongfen, a
veteran researcher in AIDS treatment integrated with TCM
methods. She said that results of the clinical research and
immunological methods over the past 10 years prove that TCM has a
40-50 percent effective rate in the treatment of AIDS.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Calls for Turco-Greek Meeting to Solve </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, February 12 (Xinhua) -- Turkey has proposed that a
high-level Turkish-Greek meeting be held to solve their disputes
over the Aegean Sea, an official statement said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The statement, issued by Turkish Foreign Ministry, said that
Turkish Foreign Minister Ismail Cem had presented a verbal note
to the Greek ambassador in Ankara to make the peace proposal.
</P>
<P>
"The response of Greece to this initiative will display and
prove the good will of both countries in the eyes of the
international community," it quoted Cem as saying.
</P>
<P>
The statement said that the U.S.-initiated "Madrid Declaration"
and the "Confidence Building Measures in the Aegean" proposed by
the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) will help improve
the Turco-Greek relationship.
</P>
<P>
They call on Turkey and Greece to avoid military confrontation
and settle their problems over the Aegean and Cyprus issue
through peaceful means.
</P>
<P>
Turkey suggests that a high-level meeting between the two
foreign ministries should be held in Ankara or Athens before the
end of March, 1998, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Spokesman of Turkish Foreign Ministry Sermet Atacanli
told Xinhua by telephone that Turkey prefers to increasing
bilateral contacts to narrow the gap between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Turkey and Greece, two traditional rivals, have long been at
odds over a series of issues, including the airspace limits,
mineral rights under the Aegean Sea as well as the thorny Cyprus
question.
</P>
<P>
Warplanes and naval vessels from the two countries, both NATO
members, are often involved in minor clashes over and in the
Aegean Sea, triggering endless accusations.

<HEADLINE> New Herbal Drugs Fight AIDS (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
According to an agreement between the Chinese and Tanzanian
governments, scientists at the Chinese Academy of TCM have used
herbal medicine, including Tokyo violet and milkvetch, to treat
approximately 10,000 Tanzanian AIDS patients.
</P>
<P>
"We've recorded a 47 percent effective rate in improving human
immuno functions and various AIDS symptoms, including asthenia,
diarrhea, fever, leanness and skin rash," according to Guan.
</P>
<P>
Apart from Chinese scientists, researchers from Hong Kong, the
United States and Japan have also recorded noticeable progress in
reconstituting curative compounds from herbs, said Guan.
</P>
<P>
Compounds extracted from Tokyo violet, snake gourd root,
liquorice and alkaloid lighten the symptoms of HIV. Balsam pear
and scutellaria also increase T4 cells, while milkvetch and
various edible fungi improve human immune functions.
</P>
<P>
"When compared with Western medical treatment which focuses
more on attacking HIV, TCM emphasizes improving the patient's
immunity in order to block the virus," according to the professor.
</P>
<P>
"Moreover, TCM compounds have fewer side effects, and are more
affordable than chemical-based drugs. Advances in TCM research
will be good news for AIDS patients," said Guan.

<HEADLINE> French Ambassador: Iraqi Proposal Positive, Not </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, February 12 (Xinhua) -- French Ambassador to Jordan
Thursday described as "positive" but "not enough" Wednesday's
proposal by Iraqi foreign minister to open altogether 68 suspected
sites to international arms inspectors.
</P>
<P>
It was a "step forward" that Iraqi Foreign Minister Mohammed
Saeed al-Sahhaf made such a proposal in Cairo, Egypt, to open all
the sites allegedly holding prohibited weapons, said Bernard
Pajolete during an interview with official Radio Jordan.
</P>
<P>
However, the Iraqi offer was "not enough" as it restricted the
appointment of weapons inspectors to U.N. Secretary General Kofi
Annan and limited the possibility of repeated inspections on the
presidential sites, Pajolete added.
</P>
<P>
France insisted that Iraq should act fully in accordance with
U.N. resolutions and let inspectors enter all the suspected sites
without any preconditions because only little time was left for
diplomatic efforts, the French ambassador said.
</P>
<P>
Pajolete warned Iraq that "Time is running out." The United
States has threatened to launch military actions against Iraq in a
week or so to make it comply with all the demands of the arms
inspectors under the U.N. Special Commission (UNSCOM).
</P>
<P>
Paris also asked Annan to put forward his own ideas on the
basis of French and Russian initiatives and pay a visit to
Baghdad as soon as possible, he said.
</P>
<P>
Since Annan had not traveled to Iraq yet, France believed that
diplomatic solution had not been exhausted, said Pajolete.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the ambassador said that his country was still
continuing contacts with all parties concerned to find a peaceful
solution to the Iraqi-U.N. standoff caused by Baghdad's
prevention of the UNSCOM inspectors from entering some suspected
sites.
</P>
<P>
French Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine had recently phoned
Annan, his Russian counterpart Yevgeny Primakov as well as Iraqi
Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz to discuss the latest
developments, Pajolete added.
</P>
<P>
France earlier submitted a proposal called "Qualitative
Formula," which means that the arms inspectors from the UNSCOM
can enter the surroundings of the presidential palaces, such as
the gardens; but they are not allowed to enter the residence
area, such as the bedrooms.

<HEADLINE> Spain's Moron Base on Standby for Possible Strike on Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MADRID, February 12 (Xinhua) -- Spain's military base at Moron
is already on standby for a possible U.S. strike against Iraq,
Spanish government sources said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
If no diplomatic solution is found to the crisis over the
United Nations weapons inspections and the United States decides
to launch a military attack against Iraq, Spain will offer the
Moron base to support U.S. operations, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
As early as in November 1997, when the crisis began, the
Spanish government declared that it would authorize the use of its
military bases by U.S. forces as long as the latter pose the
demand.
</P>
<P>
Spanish Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar reiterated on Wednesday
his government's stance that Spain would "be on the side of the
allies" in case of an attack on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The El Paris newspaper said Tuesday that Spain had already
given the United States the authorization to use its Moron base in
the southern Andalusia region.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted government sources as saying that the United
States hoped to put 30 tanker aircraft at the base for in-flight
refueling of aircraft.
</P>
<P>
A U.S. general has left to inspect the base.
</P>
<P>
Spain was a strategically important staging ground for the
U.S.-led attacks on Iraq during the 1991 Gulf War, and Moron was
one of the bases used then.

TOKYO, February 12 (Xinhua) -- Japan urged Iraq on Thursday to
accept unconditional and full United Nations weapons inspections
to avoid a U.S.-led military strike, Kyodo News Service reported.
</P>
<P>
Japanese Foreign Minister Keizo Obuchi summoned Muhsin Ali,
charge d'affaires at the Iraqi embassy in Tokyo, on Thursday and
expressed Japan's "grave concerns" over the issue, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Obuchi was quoted as telling Ali that Japan wants to see Iraq
complying with U.N. resolutions and fully cooperating with
inspectors of the U.N. Special Commission (UNSCOM).
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, Obuchi asked Chinese Ambassador Xu Dunxin
to help find a diplomatic solution to Washington's confrontation
with Iraq over its refusal to allow U.N. weapons inspections.
</P>
<P>
Obuchi told Xu that Japan hopes to resolve the Iraq crisis
through diplomatic means and that Iraq's unconditional acceptance
of U.N. inspections is essential for a peaceful solution.
</P>
<P>
In his response, Xu said China also considers Iraq's acceptance
of the inspections vital, but does not support the use of force
because it would complicate rather than resolve the problem.

<HEADLINE> Voter Registers for HK Legislature Polls Ready </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, February 12 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's Electoral
Affairs Commission (EAC) announced Thursday that lists of electors
for the first Legislative Council elections to be held this May
will be published Friday.
</P>
<P>
Citizens who have signed up as electors for the elections are
given nine days to check their registration particulars in the
provisional registers starting Friday through next Saturday
(February 21), EAC Chairman Justice Woo Kwok-hing told a press
conference Thursday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Omissions lists containing the names of former electors who are
no longer eligible to be included in the registers will also be
published for public inspection, Woo said.
</P>
<P>
"Anybody who has registered as an elector should take a look at
the registers in the coming week to ensure that his name is
included," he said.
</P>
<P>
"This will be his last chance to make sure that he may take
part in the first Legislative Council elections of the Hong Kong
Special Administrative Region," he said.
</P>
<P>
Members of the public will have up to next Saturday (February
21) to raise objections, make claims or request for corrections
regarding any entry on the registers or the omissions lists, he
added.
</P>
<P>
Cases of objections and claims will be referred to one of the
eight revising officers, who are members of the Judiciary, for
determination before February 28.
</P>
<P>
Their decisions will be reflected in the final registers to be
published before mid-March, Woo said.
</P>
<P>
The provisional register for geographical constituencies shows
that the total electorate has increased by 264,000, from 2.531
million to 2.795 million.
</P>
<P>
The figure is the result of an addition of 307,000 new electors
and the deletion of 43,000 former electors who are no longer
eligible to remain on the register.
</P>
<P>
A total of 341,000 electors' records have been updated in this
voter registration exercise, mainly involving changes of address.
</P>
<P>
"That means about 70 percent of the potential electors may go
to the polls on May 24," Woo said.
</P>
<P>
According to the provisional register for the 28 functional
constituencies, the electorate totals 139,000, representing about
60 percent of the potential electors. About 127,000 of them are
individuals while the remaining 12,000 are corporate electors.
About 10,000 authorized representatives have been appointed.
</P>
<P>
As for the 35 Election Committee subsectors, more than 139,000
people have registered as voters, Woo said. This represents a
registration rate of about 57 percent. Among them, about 127,000
are individuals and the remaining 12,000 are corporate voters, Woo
said. More than 10,000 authorized representatives have been
appointed, he added.

<P>
MOSCOW, February 12 (Xinhua) -- Tajik President Emomali
Rakhmonov appointed several Islamist opposition leaders to his
coalition government, the Interfax news agency reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted Rakhmonov's spokesman Zafar Saidov as saying
that Davlat Usmon, chief of staff of the opposition's armed
forces, was named minister of economy and foreign trade.
</P>
<P>
Other opposition members appointed were Davlatbek Makhsudov as
minister of water resources and Khudoberdy Khuliknazarov as labor
and employment minister.
</P>
<P>
And Rakhmim Karimov was to head the Tajik Customs Committee.
</P>
<P>
The appointment was seen as a key step in the settlement of a
four-year civil war in the Central Asian country.
</P>
<P>
The Russian-backed Rakhmonov government signed an inter-Tajik
peace accord with the Islamist opposition last year to end the
civil war.
</P>
<P>
A national reconciliation commission was created later to
supervise the implementation of the agreement.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, the opposition should hold the posts of
deputy prime minister and control six ministries and seven state
committees in the coalition government.

Saidov said Thursday's appointment showed the president's
effort to cooperate with the commission on a timely and complete
implementation of the peace accord.

<HEADLINE> Sino-Russian Relations to Develop Further: Ambassador </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, February 12 (Xinhua) -- This year should see an all-out
development of the Sino-Russian relations, especially in trade and
economic cooperation, China's top diplomat here said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The bilateral relations, said Li Fenglin, Chinese ambassador to
Russia, in an interview given to Itar-Tass News Agency prior to
Chinese Premier Li Peng's visit here, bore great fruits last year.
</P>
<P>
Li Peng is scheduled to arrive next Tuesday for a two-day stay.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, Chinese and Russian leaders exchanged a number of
visits, and the two countries finished the survey and demarcation
of the eastern section of their common border, Li Fenglin said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the Chinese ambassador said, the two sides
established the Sino-Russian Friendship Committee for Peace and
Development, which was oriented towards the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
These achievements not only pushed forward the Sino-Russian
relations, he said, but also established a model for the
state-to-state relations among other countries in the world.
</P>
<P>
Besides Li Peng's upcoming official visit here, Chinese
President Jiang Zemin will have an informal meeting with Russian
President Boris Yeltsin in the year's second half, he noted.
</P>
<P>
The planned exchanges between Chinese and Russian leaders would
bring new momentum for pushing further ahead the relationship
between the two neighboring countries, the ambassador said.

<HEADLINE> Conference on Arsenic Pollution Ends in Dhaka </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, February 12 (Xinhua) -- A 4-day international conference
on arsenic pollution of ground water concluded here Thursday with
the adoption of The Dhaka Declaration.
</P>
<P>
Over 280 scientists from 17 countries and regions in the field
have come to the understanding that "the ground water of a
significantly large area in Bangladesh is contaminated with high
concentration of arsenic; the cause of this arsenic contamination
is geological," the declaration stated.
</P>
<P>
It pointed out, "A large number of people including children
are suffering from chronic arsenic poisoning," and "the arsenic
problem is a threat to public health and the social structure of
Bangladesh."
</P>
<P>
Supply of arsenic-free water is the only solution to the
problem, the declaration said.
</P>
<P>
"The arsenic contamination of ground water in Bangladesh needs
to be addressed on an emergency basis," it stressed.
</P>
<P>
The conference participants agreed "to share information among
themselves, make their findings freely accessible and allow others
to use them for the interest of all people," it said.
</P>
<P>
"We shall assist in the setting up of organizations and centers
for research, training, storage and dissemination of information
relating to mitigation of the arsenic problem in Bangladesh and
all over the world," the declaration concluded.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh suffers most seriously from arsenic pollution in the
world. Fifty-two districts out of a total of 64 with a population
of 76.9 million, have been polluted. The Bangladeshi government
has taken a series of measures to control arsenic contamination.

<HEADLINE> Australian Constitutional Convention Favors Republic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, February 12 (Xinhua) -- The Australian Constitutional
Convention Thursday came down behind a republic, choosing a
proposal to appoint a president of the republic by a two-thirds
majority of both houses of federal parliament.
</P>
<P>
On the ninth day of the Constitutional Convention, the 151
delegates present made it clear they want a referendum and they
want parliament to endorse the appointment of president.
</P>
<P>
Now the republicans have only one obstacle to overcome to
ensure a referendum on the republic next year -- Prime Minister
John Howard.
</P>
<P>
When the convention opened almost two weeks ago, Howard said he
would accept the "clear view" of the convention when deciding
whether to call a referendum or put the republic issue off to a
non-binding national vote.
</P>
<P>
The final votes will be taken Friday, when delegates decide
whether to become a republic and whether to set a referendum in
train.
</P>
<P>
On the initial votes Thursday, the convention voted 75 to 71 to
endorse the Australian Republican Movement (ARM) plan as the best
model for a republic, with four delegates abstaining and two
monarchists absent.
</P>
<P>
That vote suggests the outcome Friday would be close.
</P>
<P>
Republicans would be more concerned about the stand taken by
four state Labor Opposition leaders - Queensland's Peter Beattie,
Western Australia's Geoff Gallop, South Australia's Mike Rann and
Tasmania's Jim Bacon.
</P>
<P>
At a joint media conference, they declared they would now vote
for the ARM model but would continue to campaign for a direct
election of president.
</P>
<P>
Their comments are a worrying sign for the referendum campaign.
Monarchists will be able to argue that the republicans remain
divided and the republic system may be changed within a few years.
</P>
<P>
The Labor leaders also proved that while the numbers favor a
republic, divisions remain on how it should be done.
</P>
<P>
Republicans will also be concerned about how Prime Minister
Howard will interpret their stand and whether he will consider the
final numbers really represent the convention's "clear view".

the need to continue the program on the basis of the result of a
former program which was introduced in 1989.
</P>
<P>
"As Philippine exports to Europe are growing in quality and
volume, creating technical conditions for locally-made products is
necessary," he said.
</P>
<P>
Rodriguez said this will not only mean opening the market to
the Philippines but also will put this country in a competitive
position.
</P>
<P>
Bautista said the two countries are determined to remove
unnecessary barriers, such as non-conformance of goods to
international standards, to improve their trade and investments
link.
</P>
<P>
He said the program is expected to strengthen the quality and
infrastructure and encourage the exchange of good quality
practices between economic sectors of the two countries.

<HEADLINE> Washington Blamed for Double Standard </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, February 12 (Xinhua) - An Iranian daily Thursday
blamed the United States for its double-standard policy towards
arms inspection, by rejecting Iranian and Cuban arms inspectors
visiting U.S. chemical weapons facilities.
</P>
<P>
Ironically, the U.S. is going to wage another devastating war
against Iraq because of Baghdad's demand to exclude American
inspectors from the U.N. Special Commission on disarmament
(UNSCOM) while Washington itself rejected Iranian and Cuban arms
inspectors to visit U.S. facilities, Tehran Times quoted an
unnamed "analyst" as saying.
</P>
<P>
The Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons
decided to employ about 126 inspectors to probe signatory
countries, but the U.S. announced that Iranian and Cuban
nationals should be excluded from the list of the U.N. arms
inspection team to visit U.S. chemical facilities.
</P>
<P>
"It is a clear example of double standard on the part
of the United States," the Iranian analyst said, adding that
the U.S. has waged a devastating war against Iraq (in 1991)
and for about seven years the U.S.-dominated UNSCOM in a
combing operation has been inspecting each and every inch of
the Iraqi territory.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqis had every reason to be suspicious about the
unusual prolongation of the UNSCOM operations, he said,
therefore, their demand for the expulsion of American inspectors
from the UNSCOM was quite natural.
</P>
<P>
The latest Iraqi crisis, over which the U.S. is threatening
to carry out military attack, stemmed from Baghdad's demand to
change the composition of the U.N. inspection team, (exactly
what the U.S. is doing,) the daily noted.
</P>
<P>
Despite of the strong worldwide opposition, the U. S. and
Britain have been building up their military deployment in the
Gulf preparing a military attack on Iraq following its standoff
with the U.N. over arms inspections.
</P>
<P>
Although Iraq has promised to open the eight suspected
presidential palaces to the U.N. arms inspectors, Washington and
London insisted that Baghdad should allow "unconditional and
unrestricted" arms inspection of the U.N. teams in Iraq.

</P>
<P>
Riyadh -- Director General of Saudi Arabia's Arab Investment
Company Saleh Al-Homaidan has announced that the company managed
to achieve good financial results in 1997, as its net profits
amounted to 58 million U.S. dollars, 28 million more than that of
1996.
</P>
<P>
Homaidan attributed the rise in the company's profits to the
selling of the shares of its two banking projects, namely,
Tunisia's National Economic Development Bank and Egypt's
Commercial International bank.
</P>
<P>
Cairo -- Egyptian Minister of Trade and Supply Ahmed Gowaili
declared that the Egyptian-Saudi High Commission would meet next

establishment of a joint free-trade zone, as well as ways of
promoting economic trade and investment ties between the two
countries.

<HEADLINE> Soeharto Orders Armed Forces to Act Sternly Against </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, February 12 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President Soeharto
here Thursday ordered the armed forces to take stern action
against anyone caught doing an unconstitutional act that could
lead to the nation's disintegration.
</P>
<P>
"We are all concerned over the undemocratic acts of small
groups which claim to be upholders of democracy," the president
said when receiving military officers attending the leadership
meeting of the Indonesian Armed Forces (ABRI).
</P>
<P>
Aside from taking stern measures against those who will disturb
the upcoming general session of the People's Consultative Assembly
(MPR), the military should also create a peaceful situation during
the March 1-11 session, official Antara News Agency quoted the
president as saying.
</P>
<P>
"You (the military) must carry out security measures during the
MPR assembly properly. There is no need for you to overreact, just
be alert," Soeharto, who is also commander-in-chief of the ABRI,
said.
</P>
<P>
He said that unconstitutional groups, which have been trying to
use the protracted monetary crisis to undermine the government,
should not be allowed to exist.
</P>
<P>
Rumors are circulating around the country as tension mounts
prior to the indirect presidential elections next month, he added.
</P>
<P>
"The economic crisis has yet to be overcome. The prices of
essential commodities are soaring. Companies are forced to reduce
activities or even close down," he said. All this paved the way
for certain groups to use the situation to achieve political goals
which they cannot reach through democratic and constitutional
means.

<HEADLINE> Ramos Orders Thorough Probe of Philippine Air Crash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 12 (Xinhua) -- President Fidel Ramos Thursday
ordered a thorough investigation of the DC-9 air tragedy last week
during which all 104 aboard the plane were killed.
</P>
<P>
"We must get to the bottom of this (plane crash)," Ramos told
reporters.
</P>
<P>
Ramos said he would like to know the truth of what really
happened when the Cebu Air Pacific DC-9 plane went down in heavily
forested Mount Sumagaya in the southern province of Misamis
Oriental on February 2.
</P>
<P>
All the l04 people on board -- 99 passengers and five crewmen
-- perished in the country's worst aviation crash.
</P>
<P>
Ramos' order came after the Air Transportation Office (ATO) and
the Civil Aeronautic Board (CAB) accused each other of being
responsible for approving a diverted flight plan of the ill-fated
plane.
</P>
<P>
The aircraft made an unscheduled stopover at Tacloban city
instead of going straight to Cagayan de Oro city in Misamis
Oriental from Manila. The side trip was believed to be the cause
of the crash as it forced the pilot to negotiate an unfamiliar
route.
</P>
<P>
Ramos ordered officials of the ATO and the CAB to stop
finger-pointing at this stage while investigation is in progress.
</P>
<P>
Ten days after the crash happened, rescue operations are still
going on to search for bodies of the victims and the wreckage of
the aircraft.
</P>
<P>
Rescue operations have been slow as the bodies were blown up to
pieces and thrown several kilometers away from the crash site. So
far, rescuers have retrieved about 90 bags of body parts.
</P>
<P>
The "black box", the flight data recorder which will provide
clues to the cause of the crash, has been recovered and brought to
Canada for evaluation.

<HEADLINE> E. Guinea Denies Massacre of Nigerians </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, February 12 (Xinhua) -- Equatorial Guinean officials in
Nigeria has denied reports of an indiscriminate killing of
Nigerians living in that country, but confirmed that three
Nigerians are in detention in connection with an alleged coup
plot.
</P>
<P>
Juan Antonio Bibang Nchuchuma, E.Guinea's consul-general
in Calabar, capital of the Cross River State in southeast Nigeria,
said Wednesday that there is no such a massacre as alleged by
some Nigerians returning from E. Guinea recently.
</P>
<P>
Nigerian media Tuesday quoted them as saying that some 700
Nigerians have been killed and many more put into jails in what
seems like a witch hunt against Nigerians after the failed coup
plot.
</P>
<P>
The consul-general confirmed that three retired Nigerian army
officers are currently detained in connection with the alleged
coup plot.
</P>
<P>
According to him, the officers were contracted by an E.
Guinean dissidents group which had been plotting to overthrow the
government.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, media reports said Thursday that some 100 Nigerians
newly fled from E. Guinea besieged the government of the Cross
River State Wednesday, demanding that the government take urgent
actions to evacuate and protect Nigerians in E. Guinea.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu: Israeli Not Count on Iraqi Promise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 12 (Xinhua) -- Commenting on Iraq's pledge
not to attack Israel, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
said Thursday that he does not base decisions on Israeli security
on Iraq's promises.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in Tel Aviv after taking part in the election of
chairman of Likud's Central Committee, Netanyahu said Israel is
taking all necessary precautions for any eventualities.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz said Wednesday that Iraq
had no intention or any plan to attack anybody except the
aggressor.
</P>
<P>
But Netanyahu refused to answer a question about the reported
exchange of messages between Israel and Iraq in the past
days. Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai confirmed Tuesday that
calming messages had been exchanged between Israel and Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The message of not to attack Israel was reportedly conveyed by
Russian Ambassador to Israel Mikhail Bogdanov when he met Monday
with Israeli Knesset (Parliament) Speaker Dan Tichon.
</P>
<P>
Since the possibility of an American-British military strike
against Iraq increases, there have been a panic among Israelis who
fear about possible biological and chemical retaliation by
Iraq. In the 1991 Gulf War, Iraq fired 39 Scud missiles with
conventional warheads at Israel.
</P>
<P>
Despite the repeated assurances issued by political leaders
that an Iraqi attack was highly unlikely, anxious citizens have
been flooding gas masks distribution centers across the
country. Under public pressure, Israeli Army had to seek help from
Israel's foreign missions and foreign countries for urgent supply.
</P>
<P>
This morning, 10 planes loaded with gas masks and other
protection kits landed at the Ben-Gurion Airport from European
countries, which supplied Israel gas masks. Israel has bought or
received as gifts about 400,000 gas masks in recent days
following the shortage of supply to foreign workers in Israel and
Palestinian residents living in areas under Israeli sole
control.

<HEADLINE> NPC Chairman Qiao Shi Meets Public Figures in HK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, February 12 (Xinhua) -- China's top legislator Qiao
Shi  said here Thursday he believed that Hong Kong compatriots
will make concerted efforts under the Special Administrative
Region (SAR) government to build a more prosperous Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Qiao, chairman of the Standing Committee of the National
People's Congress (NPC), made these remarks during a meeting with
a dozen public figures in Hong Kong Thursday evening.
</P>
<P>
Among them were Ann Tse-kai and leading members of the former
Basic Law drafting and advisory committees and of the former
Preparatory Committee for the HKSAR, members of the HKSAR Basic
Law Committee under the NPC Standing Committee and of the
Presidium of the Conference for Electing HKSAR Deputies to the
Ninth NPC.
</P>
<P>
Qiao spoke highly of Hong Kong compatriots' contributions to
maintaining HK's prosperity and stability and to HK's smooth
return to the motherland.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the general situation in Hong Kong has been good
with the Basic Law well implemented since the SAR was established
nearly eight months ago. The SAR government under Tung Chee Hwa
has managed local affairs effectively and done a huge amount of
fruitful work. All this has helped maintain Hong Kong's prosperity
and stability.
</P>
<P>
"We are glad to see such a good beginning in the SAR," Qiao
said.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that the Hong Kong compatriots will support the SAR
government under the leadership of Tung Chee Hwa more
energetically and make concerted efforts to build a more
prosperous Hong Kong," he added.
</P>
<P>
Present at the meeting were Qiao Shi's wife Yu Wen, Director of
the Xinhua News Agency Hong Kong Branch Jiang Enzhu, Deputy
Secretary General of the NPC Standing Committee Liu Zhen, Deputy
Director of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office of the State
Council Liu Mingqi and Deputy Secretary General of the NPC
Standing Committee Zhou Chengkui.
</P>
<P>
Thursday morning, Qiao Shi and his wife visited the Extension
of the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Center where the
handover ceremony was held on June 30 last year.
</P>
<P>
The couple also mounted the 70-storied Bank of China Building
to get a bird's-eye view of Hong Kong.

<HEADLINE> 47 People Killed In Firework Explosions In North China Province </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, February 12 (Xinhua) -- Forty-seven people were
killed and dozens injured in last month's two explosions of
fireworks in Fengrun and Lincheng counties, in north China's Hebei
Province, according official reports reaching here today.
</P>
<P>
The accidents both occurred on January 24, a few days before
the Spring Festival, the Chinese Lunar New Year's Day which fell
on January 28 this year, when people were flocking in local
markets to buy goods.
</P>
<P>
The two explosions were caused by the same mistake: vendors
tried to show off their goods by igniting some firecrackers in
front of the potential buyers, while ignoring the nearby large
stocks of fireworks.
</P>
<P>
The sparks detonated the firecracker piles and led to
devastating explosions in two cases. Besides the deaths and
injuries, over 20 vehicles were also damaged in the explosions,
according to the reports.
</P>
<P>
The provincial government has sent a special team to the two
counties to investigate the cases, and concerned departments have
been asked to step up control over the production, storage,
transportation and sale of fireworks.

<HEADLINE> Prosperity of HK Port to Continue: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, February 12 (Xinhua) -- "Hong Kong has always lived
with change and challenge, and with careful planning we can look
forward to an era of continuing prosperity for the port of Hong
Kong," said Chairman of the Port Development Board Peter Thompson.
</P>
<P>
In the foreword of the newly-published 1996-97 annual report of
the board, Thompson said, "We are now firmly established as the
new Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) of the People's
Republic of China," and was confident that "the new era will open
up new and challenging opportunities for the port, both now and
well into the next century."
</P>
<P>
The board advises the government on port development. Hong Kong
is the only major port in the world that doesn't have a port
authority and is run by the private sector.
</P>
<P>
Thompson noted that one of the most significant developments in
1996-97 was the decision to move ahead with Container Terminal 9
(CT9). The agreement reached among the parties selected to build
and operate the new terminal included a program to rationalize the
ownership of the existing berths of Container Terminus 1 to 8.
</P>
<P>
"The rationalization program, together with the completion of
CT9 in the early 2000s, will expand substantially the handling
capacity of the Kwai Chung container port by over 2.6 million TEUs
(Twenty-foot Equivalent Units)," he noted.
</P>
<P>
The new facilities and larger handling capacity will better
enable the terminal operators to handle the new generation of
larger container vessels, and to meet the needs of the shipping
alliances, he said.
</P>
<P>
The port handled 14.5 million TEUs of containers in 1997,
maintaining its position as the world's busiest container port for
six years in a row. The container port throughput is forecast to
increase by 7 percent, reaching 15.5 million TEUs in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Thompson added that work continued on both the new River Trade
Terminal at Tuen Men and the Permanent Mid-stream Facility at
Stonecutters Island. Both facilities are due to come into
operation in 1998.
</P>
<P>
"Hong Kong is thus well equipped with these different modes of
container-handling to move into the next century and to handle the
ever-increasing volume of containers moving through our port," he
commented.
</P>
<P>
The River Trade Terminal in particular is a new concept to
develop the Pearl River Delta waterways as the water highways for
carrying containers between Hong Kong and the many delta ports in
southern China, he added.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka's Opposition Party Leader Under Threat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, February 12 (Xinhua) -- A group of old guard members
of the United National Party (UNP), the main opposition party in
Sri Lanka, have been alleged to plan a coup to oust its leader
Ranil Wickremasinghe, the national news agency Lankapuvath
reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Lankapuvath quoted political sources as saying that most of the
members in the group are those who had carried out acts of murder,
bribery and corruption during the 17-year UNP regime. The UNP was
defeated by the People's Alliance in the 1994 general elections.
</P>
<P>
They have already launched an open campaign against
Wickremasinghe's leadership, the news agency said.
</P>
<P>
Fearing they would be punished by law, they formed a survival
group to protect themselves.
</P>
<P>
According to the sources, among the group are a number of
former parliamentarians, former arms dealers and businessmen
engaged in illegal activities. They had made millions of rupees
(62 Sri Lankan rupees to one U.S. dollar at current rate) through
corruption, the news agency added.
</P>
<P>
It said that as a last resort to save themselves and return to
power by hook or by crook, they launched the campaign to seek the
support of former UNP strongman Sirisena Cooray and planned to
replace Wickremasinghe with Cooray.
</P>
<P>
So far the UNP is not available for comment.

<HEADLINE> Chinese President Meets With U.S. Religious Leaders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 12 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin
said here today that he welcomes friends from the U.S. religious
circle to visit China.
</P>
<P>
During a meeting with three visiting American religious
leaders, Jiang said that U.S. clergy could see for themselves what
is happening in China and hear about the ideas and views of the
people from all walks of life, especially in the religious
community. The U.S. clergy then could relate what they have seen
and heard to the U.S. public to improve the mutual understanding
between the people of the two countries, he said.
</P>
<P>
The three U.S. clergymen were Rabbi Arthur Schneier, president
of the Appeal of Conscience Foundation; Archbishop Theodore
McCarrick of the Newark Roman Catholic Archdiocese; and Reverend
Don Argue, president of the National Association of
Evangelicals. They and their delegation are visiting China as
guest of the Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs.
</P>
<P>
Jiang recalled his state visit to the United States last October
and said it had promoted the development of Sino-U.S. ties and
improved mutual understanding between the two peoples.
</P>
<P>
China and the United States share extensive common interests,
though they have differences on some issues, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
The lack of mutual understanding is one of the major
factors resulting in the differences, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
He went on to say that the only correct way of narrowing or
even eliminating the differences is to expand bilateral
exchanges, enhance mutual understanding and seek common
ground while preserving divergences on the basis of equality and
mutual respect.
</P>
<P>
The American religious leaders said that President Jiang's
U.S. tour had greatly promoted the Sino-U.S. relations.
</P>
<P>
They told Jiang that the purpose of their ongoing China trip is
to increase the exchange between the religious circles of the two
countries, enhance the mutual understanding and friendship between
the American and Chinese peoples, and further promote
theimprovement and development the Sino-U.S. ties.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. clergymen said they are ready to build a bridge for
the U.S.-China dialogue and exchanges together with their Chinese
counterparts and personnel from other sectors.
</P>
<P>
The American visitors are also scheduled to visit Nanjing,
Shanghai and Lhasa, in addition to Beijing.

<HEADLINE> HK Grants to Aid Northwestern China Snowstorm Victims </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, February 12 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's Disaster Relief
Fund Advisory Committee has approved two grants for emergency
relief for the snowstorm victims in northwestern China's Qinghai
province.
</P>
<P>
One grant of 2.6 million HK dollars (0.33 million U.S. dollars)
was to Oxfam Hong Kong and another of 3.5 million HK dollars (0.44
million U.S. dollars) was to World Vision Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
The committee, chaired by Administrative Secretary Anson Chan,
is concerned about the hardship suffered by the victims and hopes
that the two grants could help provide some immediate relief.
</P>
<P>
To ensure that the money will be used for the purpose
designated, the Special Administrative Region (SAR) government has
required the two agencies concerned to submit an evaluation report

<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, February 12 (Xinhua) -- The Seoul Municipality announced
Thursday its decision, effective next Friday, to raise taxi fares
by an average of 23.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
The basic fee for entering a taxi will grow from the current
1,000 won (about 0.70 U.S. dollar) to 1,300 won (0.91 dollar).
</P>
<P>
The municipal government attributed the rise to the fuel prices
hike -- up nearly 100 percent since late last year -- which are
caused by the country's current financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
Over the past two months, the Seoul Municipality has raised the
fares of buses and subway while the country has increased those of
domestic and international flight.
</P>
<P>
Since late 1997, South Korean won has dipped deep down against
the dollar as the nation faces serious financial troubles caused
by corporate failures and bad loans of financial institutions
</P>
<P>
The won stood at 900 against the dollar last September, but it
is now 1,623 against the U.S. currency.

<HEADLINE> China Calls for Assistance for Laid-Off Workers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 12 (Xinhua) -- The Communist Youth League,
China's leading youth organization, today called on the country's
younger generation to provide voluntary services for urban poor,
most of whom are laid-off from state enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The Central Committee of the Youth League issued a circular
listing major categories of voluntary services, including free
legal consultations and household services for poor families, free
vocational training and employment services for laid-off workers,
and persuading business people to supply funding and technology for
reemploying laid-off people.
</P>
<P>
Young people should be urged to donate money and materials to
laid-off workers leading an extremely difficult life, according to
the circular.
</P>
<P>
The circular noted that March 5 will be the 35th anniversary of
Chairman Mao Zedong's call for the country to learn from Lei Feng,
a model soldier of the People's Liberation Army who was always
ready to help others.
</P>
<P>
Lei Feng's name has been widely known to the vast majority of
Chinese citizens since Mao made the call and wrote the special
inscription "Learn From Comrade Lei Feng" on March 5, 1963. March
has been designated as the month in which Chinese citizens
remember Lei Feng by doing something good for the society.
</P>
<P>
"Youth League organizations across the country should focus
on commemorative activities to assist the poor, and should extend
assistance to laid-off workers," according to the circular.
</P>
<P>
Since 1993, the Communist Youth League has consistently
promoted the national campaign "Chinese Young Volunteers in
Action" to immunize the country's youth from the negative
influences of the market economy and prompt them to follow
the example of Lei Feng.

<HEADLINE> Anti-drug Campaign Hit by Reinstates of Rebagliati's Gold </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAGANO, Japan, February 12 (Xinhua) -- The world-wide anti-drug
campaign was given a heavy blow on Thursday when the Court of
Arbitration for Sport (CAS) overturned the decision of the
International Olympic Committee to strip Canadian snowboarder Ross
Rebagliati of his gold medal.
</P>
<P>
The IOC announced on Wednesday that Rebagliati was disqualified
from the games after a rountine drugs test showed up traces of
marijuana.
</P>
<P>
The CAS special tribunal, set up for the first time at the Atlanta
Olympic Summer Games in 1996, consists of independent arbitrators,
chosen for their expertise in arbitration and sports law.
</P>
<P>
In researching their decision, the three arbitrators said:"we do
not suggest for a moment that the use of marijuana should be
condoned, nor do we suggest that sports authorities are not entitled
to exclude athletes found to use cannabis. But if sports
authorities wish to add their own sanctions to those that are
edicted by public authorities, they must do so in an explicit
fashion. That has not been done here.
</P>
<P>
"The Panel recognizes from an ethical and medical perspective,
cannabis consumption is a matter of serious social concern.
</P>
<P>
"CAS is not, however, a criminal court and can neither promulgate
nor apply penal laws. We must decide within the context of the law of
sports, and cannot invent prohibitions or sanctions where none
appear."
</P>
<P>
The chief executive of the Canadian Olympic Association Carol Ann
Letheren said at a press conference that the IOC rules as they stand
have allowed Rebagliati to excape even if the concentration of
marijunana was much higher.
</P>
<P>
"We are simply saying that in this particular occasion there were
no legal grounds for the decision (to strip Rebagliati of his gold
medal).
</P>
<P>
"Clearly the IOC medical code does not have marijuana as a banned
substance. It is labelled as a restricted substance," she said.
</P>
<P>
IOC Director General Francois Carrard said on Wednesday that
metabolized marijuana was detected in an "A" sample, and then a "B"
sample confirmed 17.8 nanograms per milliliter of the substance.
</P>
<P>
The IOC has no minimum amounts set for substance infractions, but
the International Ski Federation to which Rebagliati is a member sets
15 nanogram limit.
</P>
<P>
Deciding between issuing a warning or sanctions to the snowboarder,
both the medical commission and the IOC Executive Board voted in
favour of sanctions.
</P>
<P>
The medical commission voted 13-12 to recommend sanctioning the
snowboarder to the IOC which takes the action. The IOC executive
board voted 3-2 with 2 abstentions on the matter.
</P>
<P>
Possession of drugs is illegal in Japan, and Rebagliati had been
questioned by Japanese police.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lankan Shrimp Farmers Resume Production </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, February 12 (Xinhua) -- Shrimp farmers in the
northwest of Sri Lanka are resuming production after a loan of 1
billion rupees (16.1 million U.S. dollars) was offered to revive
the industry.
</P>
<P>
The Central Bank of Sri Lanka has released the loan in a bid to
help the shrimp farmers in the region, who suffered heavy losses
last year due to the spreading of a killer virus, the SEMBV.
</P>
<P>
Local businessmen said Thursday about 35 percent of the
country's 6,000 acres (2,428 hectares) of shrimp farmland in the
northwestern region resumed production at the end of January.
</P>
<P>
Shrimp is an important export item of Sri Lanka. In 1995,
shrimp exports amounted to 47 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Besides the virus, another factor that affected the industry
last year was the continuous rainfall.
</P>
<P>
Excessive rainfall last September and early January reduced the
salinity level of water in the farmland, making it unsuitable to
raise shrimps, the businessmen explained.
</P>
<P>
However, the persistent draught since early January, which is
expected to last till May, has helped improve the salinity level
and enabled farms to begin their production cycles, they said.

The Australian dollar fell nearly half a US cent to close at

<HEADLINE> Master Plan to Control Air Pollution, Acid Rain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 12 (Xinhua) -- China will unveil a master
plan to combat the country's worsening air pollution and acid
rain, a top environmental official announced today.
</P>
<P>
The program will focus on controlling sulfur dioxide (SO2)
emissions, the main pollutant of the atmosphere and the cause of
acid rain, said Xie Zhenhua, director of the National
Environmental Protection Agency (NEPA) at a news conference here.
</P>
<P>
He said the State Council has approved the NEPA plan that maps
out the sulfur dioxide and acid rain control zones with detailed
measures to fight the environmental threat.
</P>
<P>
According to the plan, all the industrial sources discharging
SO2 must meet national standards before 2000 to ensure the total
amount of sulfur dioxide discharges are brought under control.
</P>
<P>
Areas seriously affected by acid rain should have reversed the
trend by 2000.
</P>
<P>
The annual emission of sulfur dioxide in China is around 23
million tons and 63 cities are suffering from serious SO2
pollution. Some 800,000 square kilometers, or 8.4 percent of the
country's territory, are experiencing acid rain.
</P>
<P>
Xie said China will stem SO2 pollution at its sources. For
example, the country will restrict mining coal with a sulfur
content exceeding 3 percent.
</P>
<P>
Thermal power plants must install sweetening facilities while a
fee will be charged for sulfur dioxide discharge, Xie said.
</P>
<P>
Measures to improve air quality also include reducing auto
pollution. All vehicles must use lead-free gasoline by 2000 and
existing ones should have installed emission-control devices.
</P>
<P>
"Vehicles without emission-purifying devices, imported or
domestic-made alike, should not be allowed to enter the market in
the future," Xie said.
</P>
<P>
Following the suit of 27 cities -- including Nanjing, Shanghai,
Xiamen and Dalian -- more cities plan to publish on a weekly basis
main indexes of local air quality this year. Beijing is among the
cities which will introduce the report system in the first half of
the year, Xie said.

<HEADLINE> Australian Stocks End Down As Unemployment Figures Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, February 12 (Xinhua) -- The Australian sharemarket
closed weaker Thursday on the back of profit-taking among the
resource majors and a lack of positive domestic news after the
release of January employment figures failed to inspire investors.
</P>
<P>
The official data showed the unemployment rate rose to 8.2 in
January from 8.1 in December, and the number of jobless was rose
by 3000 to 756,100.
</P>
<P>
The all ordinaries index closed down 3.7 points at 2,674.3.
</P>
<P>
National turnover was 345.19 million valued at 918.19 million
Australian dollars (624.36 million US dollars), with falls
outnumbering rises 580 to 539.
</P>
<P>
The all resources index closed down 8.2 points at 1,173.5 and
the all industrials index closed up 0.8 at 4,560.0.
</P>
<P>
Major resource companies, BHP, WMC and Rio Tinto, all lost
ground as some investors took profits, brokers said.
</P>
<P>
"Those stocks have had a reasonable good run of late, so it was
just a bit of profit taking," traders said.
</P>
<P>
Topping volume were Telstra installment receipts - up seven
cents on turnover of 14.14 million valued at 49.78 million
Australian dollars.
</P>
<P>
"I think everyone is comparing Telstra to the Commonwealth Bank
who continued to strip out costs," an institutional stock broker
at Hartley Poynton said.
</P>
<P>
The January job figures, which were below expectations, failed
to provide the equities market with any leads, brokers said.
</P>
<P>
"We were expecting stronger employment data," said a Sydney
broker, "the figures didn't provide any leads."
</P>
<P>
The gold index was down 10.7 points at 1,163.3, with trading in
Sydney gold bullion closed steady at 300.95 US dollars an ounce.

<HEADLINE> (Round-up) IOC Decision Overturned, Norwegians Set Records </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAGANO, Japan, February 12 (Xinhua) -- The Court of Arbitration for
Sport overturned the decision of the International Olympic Committee
to strip Canadian snowboarder Ross Rebagliati of his gold medal on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile in competitions, Norwegian skiier and skater Bjoern
Daehlie and Aadne Sondral set records on the sixth day of the 18th
Olympic Winter Games with victories in the men's 10km cross country
skiing classical race and the men's 1,500m speed skating.
</P>
<P>
Rebagliati, gold medal winner of the men's giant slalom event, was
disqualified by the IOC after a routine drugs test showed up traces of
marijuana.
</P>
<P>
But the CAS decided that there were not legal grounds to punish
Rebagliati. "We must decide within the context of the law of sports,
and cannot invent prohibitions or sanctions where none appear," the
three arbitrators said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The Canadian Olympic Association chief executive Carol Ann Letheren
said at a press conference said the IOC medical code did not have
marijuana as a banned substance. "It is labelled as a restricted
substance," she said.
</P>
<P>
In the day's first medal event, Daehlie held off bad weather and
other medal contenders to cross the finish line with a winning time of
27 minutes and 24.5 seconds.
</P>
<P>
With the victory, Daehlie became the first male athlete to win six
Winter Olympic golds and the second to have such achievement. Lidia
Skoblikova, women skater from former Soviet Union, collected a total
of six golds in 1960 and 1964 Winter Games.
</P>
<P>
Markus Gandler of Austria was second with eight seconds behind and
Italian Mika Myllylae, gold medal winner in Monday's 30km classical
race, was third with further 15.6 seconds behind.
</P>
<P>
National hero Daehlie, who finished a disappointing 20th in the
men's 30km, led at every split of the race and collapsed in exhaustion
at the finish line.
</P>
<P>
Daehlie had trained hard in his career. In his 1997 autobiography,
he estimated that he covered 150,000 kilometers on skis, foot or
cycling over the previous decade --the equivalent of alomost four
trips round the world.
</P>
<P>
Philip Boit, the only athlete representing Kenya which makes its
debut at Winter Olympics, finished 50th in 47 minutes and 25.5
seconds, a time that Daehlie Bjoern could finish the distance two
times.
</P>
<P>
While in the ice rink of M-Wave, Sondral smashed the world record
of the 1,500m speed skating as well as Dutch's hope of the title.
</P>
<P>
Sondral, armed with flap skates, was timed one minute and 47.87
seconds to win the race, beating three Dutch rivals to the lower
placings.
</P>
<P>
Ids Postmas was second at 1:48.13 and another Dutch skater Rintje
Ritsma, who set the world mark of 1:48.88 last December, finished
third at 1:48.52.
</P>
<P>
Braving steady rain in mountains, Larissa Lazutina of Russia won
the women's 10km cross country skiing free pursuit at 46 minutes and
6.9 seconds.
</P>
<P>
The Russian skiier spent three Olympics and six years to win her
first Olympic gold medal, but it took her only five days to win her
second one.
</P>
<P>
In the women's 5km cross country skiing classical race on Monday,
she held off strong Norwegian rivals and heavy snow to win the title.
</P>
<P>
With the win in the pursuit, she became the only ahthlete who has
collected two gold medals at the current games.
</P>
<P>
The men's and women's snowboarding halfpipe event were taken by
Swiss and German boarders. Gian Simmen scored 85.2 points to win the
men's event for Switzerland and Nicola Thost came first at 74.6 points
in the women's discipline.
</P>
<P>
Bad Weather continued to have its say in competiton, forcing the
cancellation of two Alpine events, the men's downhill and combined
downhill. The two events were re-scheduled for Friday.
</P>
<P>
After six day competitions, Germany roared to the top of the medal
standings with four golds, four silvers and four bronzes. Russia was
second at four golds and three silvers. Winter sports powerhouse
Norway was third at three golds.

<HEADLINE> Canadian Press Chief: No Legal Ground to Punish Rebagliati </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAGANO, Japan, February 12 (Xinhua) -- Canadian team press chief
Sylie Bigras said on Thursday that there was no legal ground to punish
Canadian snowboarding champion Ross Rebagliati.
</P>
<P>
"IOC codes does not list marijuana as banned substance, it is
listed as restricted substance," she said at a press conference.
</P>
<P>
The Court of Arbitration for Sport has overturned a decision by the
International Olympic Committee to strip Rebagliati of gold medal.
</P>
<P>
She added the the CAS heard Rebagliati's statement Wednesday
evening. Rebagliati stated that he did not take marijuana since April
1997.
</P>
<P>
The press chief noted that it does not mean Canada was in favour of
taking marijuana. "Just in this case, there is no legal ground to make
any decision to disqualify Rebagliati," she added.
</P>
<P>
IOC Director-General Francois Carrard said on Wednesday that
metabolized marijuana was detected in an "A" sample, and then a "B"
sample confirmed 17.8 nanograms per milliliter of the substance.
</P>
<P>
The IOC has no minimum amounts set for substance infractions, but
the International Ski Federation to which Rebagliati is a member sets
15 nanogram limit.
</P>
<P>
Deciding between issuing a warning or sanctions to the snowboarder,
both the medical commission and the IOC Executive Board voted in
favour of sanctions.
</P>
<P>
The medical commission voted 13-12 to recommend sanctioning the
snowboarder to the IOC which takes the action. The IOC executive
board voted 3-2 with 2 abstentions on the matter, Carrard said.
</P>
<P>
Possession of marijuana is illegal in Japan, and Rebagliati was
questioned in a police station in Nagano this afternoon.

<HEADLINE> Billions Needed to Finance China's Environmental Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 12 (Xinhua) -- China needs at least 450
billion yuan (54 billion dollars) to finance an environmental
protection program expected to be completed by the end of the
century, a high-ranking Chinese environmental official announced
today at a news conference.
</P>
<P>
Xie Zhenhua, director of the National Environmental Protection
Agency (NEPA), said that priority will be given to water and air
pollution treatment, controls for sulfur dioxide emissions and
acid rain.
</P>
<P>
All industrial polluting sources across the country are
required to meet discharge standards by year 2000, Xie said, and
protection of the ecological environment should be strengthened in
a practical way.
</P>
<P>
While the central government will coordinate and partly pay for
the regional clean-up efforts, provincial and city governments
will be responsible for their urban areas and regions. Individual
polluters are required to contribute based on the principle that
polluters must pay, Xie said.
</P>
<P>
Financial assistance from the international community,
Sino-foreign cooperation and loans from foreign banks are also
effective channels for fund-raising, he said.
</P>
<P>
Xie had recently announced at a press conference that the
Chinese government would invest 180 billion yuan in environmental
pollution treatment and rebuilding the environment. The investment
will be poured into 1,600 environmental projects, including
pollution treatment in the Huaihe River basin, Taihu Lake area,
and Dianchi Lake, the three most-polluted river basins in the
country.
</P>
<P>
"The environmental pollution is deteriorating across China in
general, with environment in parts of the country improving," said
Xie, when asked to give a general evaluation of China's
environmental situation.
</P>
<P>
"But I have confidence in the Chinese government's drive to
successfully check the environmental pollution by 2000, which will
lead to an overall environmental improvement both in China's
inland areas and the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region," he
emphasized.

<HEADLINE> Arbitrators Reinstate Rebagliati's Gold </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAGANO, Japan, February 12 (Xinhua) -- The Court of Arbitration for
Sport has overturned the decision of the International Olympic
Committee to strip Canadian snowboarder Ross Rebagliati of his gold
medal after a routine drugs test showed up traces of marijuana.
</P>
<P>
The IOC said it "will comply with all aspects of this award."
</P>
<P>
The CAS sepcial tribunal, set up for the first time at the Atlanta
Olympic Summer Games in 1996, consists of independent arbitrators,
chosen for their expertise in arbitration and sports law.
</P>
<P>
In reaching their decision, the three arbitrators said:"We do not
suggest for a moment that the use of marijuana should be condoned, nor
do we suggest that sports authorities are not entitled to exclude
athletes found to use cannabis.
</P>
<P>
"But if sports authorities wish to add their own sanctions to those
that are edicted by public authorities, they must do so in an explicit
fashion."
</P>
<P>
The panel found that the IOC had not challenged the snowboarder's
claim that he had not taken the drug since April 1997, and that its
presence in his body was due to second-hand ingestion of cannabis
smoke at a going away party.
</P>
<P>
Also among the panel's key findings was the fact that Drug
Formulary Guide issued by the Nagano Olympic Organizing Committee does
not list marijuana as a prohibited substance but as one which should
be used "cautiously".

<HEADLINE> Schools in N. Uganda Fail to Operate for Poor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, February 12 (Xinhua) -- Many primary and secondary
schools in an Uganda northern district failed to operate in the
new term due to poor sanitation, The New Vision reported
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
P.J. Ogwang, the district education officer in Lira district,
said Tuesday that only a few schools passed the hygienic check
ordered by Crispus Kiyonga, the Health Minister.
</P>
<P>
The health minister instructed medical authorities late last
month to have checks on hygienic condition of schools before the
new term beginning from earlier this month to guarantee
appropriate conditions for students for prevention from cholera.
</P>
<P>
Ogwang said a joint survey by groups made up of schools,
medical personnel and the cholera task force have found many
schools lack of latrines, urinals and running water.
</P>
<P>
A directive had been issued as a result of the joint survey to
delay the operation of the schools under hygienic standard for
two or three weeks during which the schools can improve their
facilities.
</P>
<P>
Cholera hit 26 of total 45 districts of the country and has
killed more than 400 people in recent rainy months.

<P>
BEIJING, February 12 (Xinhua) -- China this year will continue
taking severe actions to crack down on crimes directly harming
public security, said an official with the Central Committee for
Comprehensive Management of Public Security (CCCMPS).
</P>
<P>
According to the official, public security work inside and
outside big- and medium-size state-owned enterprises will be
further enhanced to create a better social environment for the
enterprises' production activities.
</P>
<P>
Crimes concerning damage to telecommunications facilities,
railways, civil aviation facilities, electric power facilities,
oil fields and mines will be strictly punished, the official said.
</P>
<P>
He said that public security work in areas around middle and
primary schools will receive more attention this year, and legal
education for students will be strengthened.
</P>
<P>
Also, he said, efforts will be undertaken this year to better
guide the transient population and manage the work well.
</P>
<P>
"Various training programs to improve young laborers' legal
awareness, morality and job skills will be organized," the
official said, "and the house-renting business will be rectified
to prevent law-violation cases from happening as well as to
protect the lawful rights of the floating population."
</P>
<P>
Another major issue China will focus on this year is to help
those just released from prison, the official said.
</P>
<P>
CCCMPS, a regular organization of the Chinese Communist Party's
Central Committee founded in 1991, was supposed to provide

<HEADLINE> Mandela Meets Congolese Leader </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 12 (Xinhua) -- President Nelson Mandela
met the self-styled leader of the Republic of Congo, Denis
Sassou--Nguesso, in Cape Town Wednesday, who seeks South Africa's
support for his isolated government.
</P>
<P>
Mandela met Sassou at his residence in Cape Town and emerged
for a photo opportunity with his hand on Sassou's arm, laughing,
local newspapers reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether the meeting signified that South Africa would
recognize Sassou's government, Mandela told reporters, "the
deputy president (Thabo Mbeki) is going to flesh it out."
</P>
<P>
The two had not met since Sassou's rebels violently toppled
the democratically elected government of Pascal Lissouba last
October.
</P>
<P>
Mandela declined to elaborate, but Sassou was scheduled to
meet Mbeki in Cape Town later Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Mandela's government condemned Sassou's take-over and has
refused to recognize the new regime of the tiny oil-rich Central
African nation.
</P>
<P>
Sassou quietly arrived in South Africa Tuesday for what
President Mandela's aides said is a strictly private visit.
</P>
<P>
Local political analysts said Sassou is not only seeking
political recognition, but also wants Mandela's help in
neutralizing his opponents now living in exile in South Africa.

HAIKOU, February 12 (Xinhua) -- Exports in Hainan, China's
southernmost island province, rose by 165.6 percent to 610 million
US dollars for 1997.
</P>
<P>
The increase in exports was aided by preferential
policies which encouraged enterprises to expand their export
business. Local customs officials have been making an effort to
improve efficiency and provide customs clearance around the clock.
</P>
<P>
As a result, local customs officials inspected 4.43 million
tons of export commodities in 1997. Commodities for import and
export climbed 65.6 percent over the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the customs imposed 1.14 billion yuan (142 million
U.S. dollars) of customs duties, an increase of 34.7 percent. They
retrieved 365 million yuan by investigating and handling 180
smuggling cases, according to statistics.

BEIJING, February 12 (Xinhua) -- The director of China's
Environmental Protection Agency, Xie Zhenhua, says that China has
been hit by acid rain for the past 10 years, but whether the

PARIS, February 12 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items
in leading French newspapers Thursday:
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- Some 40,000 people demonstrated in silence Wednesday in
Corsica to protest violence, five days after the assassination of
the prefect of the island, Claude Erignac. The demonstration was
organized by the ``Movement for Life,'' a women's organization
created in 1994.
</P>
<P>
-- By announcing that its forces gathering in the Gulf will be
ready to strike Iraq within a week, the United States Wednesday gave
a message to Baghdad in the style of an ultimatum, although
Washington admits there still exists some time for a diplomatic
solution if Iraq allows U.N. inspectors to work ``free and without
restriction.''
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- Nigeria has decided to finish with the junta of Sierra Leon
which has been in power in Freetown since the coup d'etat of May 25,
1997. The Nigeria-led West African peace-keeping force Ecomog is
strangling the Sierra Leonese capital where civilians are caught in
the fighting without chance to flee.
</P>
<P>
-- Iraq announced Wednesday that it will allow a team of U.N.
inspectors to be appointed by U.N. secretary general to inspect
eight presidential sites ``from top to bottom.'' The decision was
welcomed by France as ``a step forward'' although Paris judges the
term ``from top to bottom'' as too vague. Meanwhile, the United
States could launch a military strike against Iraq from February 22
to March 5.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Stock Exchange to Implement News Rules </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 12 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine Stock Exchange
(PSE) is set to implement new rules and regulations governing
securities borrowing and lending (SBL) and short selling of
securities in the country starting the third quarter of this year.
</P>
<P>
This was revealed Thursday by the Product Development
Department of the PSE which was tasked to come out with these
rules and regulations.
</P>
<P>
Product Development analyst Violeta Defeo said the draft of the
new rules and regulations is now being studied and reviewed by
PSE's Board of Governors for its final approval.
</P>
<P>
Although she declined to say what these rules and regulations
are all about, she made sure that these rules are "beneficial" to
the interests of the capital market in the country.
</P>
<P>
A SBL transaction involves the loan of securities by a lender
who owns or controls them, to a borrower who needs them to support
trading strategies or settlement of obligations.
</P>
<P>
The introduction of SBL and short selling would help the
country establish a system of borrowing and lending to protect the
interests of all stake holders.
</P>
<P>
The reason of introducing SBL and short selling in the country
is for them to be institutionalized onshore since the common
practice is for investors to borrow securities from overseas,
particularly Hong Kong, where this scheme is being practiced right
now, says Defeo.
</P>
<P>
In a PSE study, the only countries in Asia and the Pacific that
have yet to adopt the practice of SBL and short selling onshore
are the Philippines and Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
"One of the major reasons for the non-existence of SBL in the
Philippines has been the lack of regulations that would provide
clear and specific guidelines for both local and international
market players," the study noted.

<HEADLINE> Shandong Finds More Jobs for Unemployed People </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JINAN, February 12 (Xinhua) -- Some 410,000 unemployed and
laid-off workers in east China's Shandong Province found new jobs
in the past year thanks to a local government program.
</P>
<P>
By merging and reorganizing the company, troubled enterprises
have been able to return to production, allowing a large number of
employees to return to their jobs.
</P>
<P>
Some other enterprises are setting up various companies to
employ laid-off workers. The Yanzhou Mining Administration, a
major coal producer, has put half of its employees into other
businesses.
</P>
<P>
The 8,000 enterprises now involved in the service trade in
Shandong employ 400,000 people, and more than 100,000 unemployed
and laid-off workers are working for private companies, or are
self-employed, or working at temporary jobs.

<HEADLINE> Southwest Chinese Railway Safety During Festival Season </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, February 12 (Xinhua) -- The railways of southwestern
China had carried 6.1 million passengers as of yesterday during
the Spring Festival peak period, according to the Chengdu Railway
Administration, which is in charge of the area.
</P>
<P>
Since Sichuan Province, where Chengdu is located, and Chongqing
Municipality are home to about 5.5 million transient rural
laborers, railways are incredibly busy during the Spring Festival
holiday, when the majority of them try to go home for festival
celebrations with their relatives.
</P>
<P>
The busy time this year began on January 30, the third day of
the festival, when the daily passenger load exceeded
250,000. Above 60 percent of the trains were overloaded, and there
were another 50,000 to 70,000 passengers waiting to buy tickets at
railway stations.
</P>
<P>
In order to cope with the situation, the Chengdu authorities
introduced 37 temporary trains and sent over 3,000 office workers
to work as train attendants.

<HEADLINE> Anti-drug Campaign Hit by Reinstates of Rebagliati's Gold </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAGANO, Japan, February 12 (Xinhua) -- The world-wide anti-drug
campaign was given a heavy blow on Thursday when the Court of
Arbitration for Sport overturned the decision of the International
Olympic Committee to strip Canadian snowboarder Ross Rebagliati of his
gold medal.
</P>
<P>
The IOC announced on Wednesday that Rebagliati was disqualified
from the games after a rountine drugs test showed up traces of
marijuana.
</P>
<P>
IOC Director General Francois Carrard said on Wednesday that
metabolized marijuana was detected in an "A" sample, and then a "B"
sample confirmed 17.8 nanograms per milliliter of the substance.
</P>
<P>
The IOC has no minimum amounts set for substance infractions, but
the International Ski Federation to which Rebagliati is a member sets
15 nanogram limit.
</P>
<P>
Deciding between issuing a warning or sanctions to the snowboarder,
both the medical commission and the IOC Executive Board voted in
favour of sanctions.
</P>
<P>
The medical commission voted 13-12 to recommend sanctioning the
snowboarder to the IOC which takes the action. The IOC executive
board voted 3-2 with 2 abstentions on the matter.
</P>
<P>
Possession of drugs is illegal in Japan, and Rebagliati had been
questioned by Japanese police.

<HEADLINE> Share Prices Decline on Singapore Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, February 12 (Xinhua) -- Share prices reversed its
upward trend and declined on the Singapore market on Thursday as
the benchmark Straits Times Industrials Index (STII) lost 20.96
points to close at 1,600.29 points.
</P>
<P>
Dealers noted that share prices dropped by 1.3 percent as
investors locked in profits and took a rest from six straight days
of gains.
</P>
<P>
They also said that weaker regional currencies contributed to
the stock market sell-off. Share prices had risen after Indonesia
announced that it planned to set up a currency board system.
However, the dealers said that the situation is still uncertain
and investors continued to seek trading opportunities amid
volatility.
</P>
<P>
The total market volume shrank to 697.47 million units, valued
at 697.66 million Singapore dollars (about 425.4 million US
dollars). Declines overwhelmed advances by 380 to 34, while 198
other counters remained unchanged.
</P>
<P>
Renong Bhd was the most actively traded counter as it
registered a turnover of 60.72 million units. It was followed by
Rekapac which had 55.38 million shares traded. MBf Capital was
next with 27.98 million shares changed hands.
</P>
<P>
The Singapore Press Holdings (SPH) Foreign led the gainers of
the day as it rose by 1.4 dollars to finish at 24.9 Singapore
dollars. Asean Fund increased by 75 cents to end at 9.25 Singapore
dollars. SPH was up by 60 cents to close at 20.2 Singapore
dollars.
</P>
<P>
On the downside, Bukit Sambawang was the biggest loser as it
declined by 1.15 dollars to end at 9.65 Singapore dollars. Malaya
Banking 200 fell by 1.05 dollars to close at 5.55 Singapore
dollars. DBS (Development Bank of Singapore) Foreign and Malaya
Banking lost 60 cents each to finish at 13.7 and 5.6 Singapore
dollars respectively.

<HEADLINE> Africa's Public Service Reform Needs Improvement: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 12 (Xinhua) -- African countries have
had mixed success in reforming inefficient and corruption-prone
bureaucracies over the past decade, a report of the International
Monetary Fund (IMF) said.
</P>
<P>
There has been some progress in down-sizing and cost-cutting,
but decidedly less in improving the quality of public services,
Thursday's Business Day paper quoted the report as saying.
</P>
<P>
The working paper by the IMF fiscal affairs department
emphasizes the need for improved "recruitment, remuneration and
promotion policies, based on performance rather than
connections".
</P>
<P>
The paper looked at 32 countries, including Kenya, Ghana, Cote
d'Ivoire, Uganda, Zambia, South Africa and Zimbabwe. Twenty-nine
of the countries undertook public sector reforms as part of IMF
structural adjustment packages starting in the mid-eighties.
</P>
<P>
Overall, the governments have shed employees since the
beginning of the decade. The 24 central governments for which
there was adequate data shrank their total payroll from 2 million
U.S. dollars in 1991 to 1.8 million U.S. dollars in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Over the same period, state wage bills fell from an average of
7.2 percent to 5.8 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) in the
32 countries, and they accounted for a reduced share of
government expenditure.
</P>
<P>
Real wages per public servant fell an average 12 percent in 20
countries.
</P>
<P>
However, most of this positive trend was mainly due to the
devaluation of the central African franc in 1994, which slashed
real wages in much of Francophone Africa, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The falling real public service wages also meant that few
countries were able to narrow salary differentials with
non-governmental sectors -- an important objective if governments
are to attract and retain skilled and honest personnel, it said.
</P>
<P>
The desirable widening of salary gap between bottom and
top-level employees has been slow, and some countries, such as
Cameroon, has reduced the highest public servant salary in
relation to the lowest.
</P>
<P>
The report said this could threaten public bureaucracies'
ability to keep talent.

<HEADLINE> China Not Favoring Use of Force to Resolve Iraq Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 12 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Foreign Ministry
spokesman Zhu Bangzao today reiterated that China does not favor
the use of force to resolve the arms inspection crisis in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Zhu told a regular news conference that U.S. Ambassador to the
United Nations Bill Richardson will, as a special envoy of U.S.
President Bill Clinton, come to China to exchange views on the
crisis.
</P>
<P>
China will expound its views to the United States and its
proposal to seek a peaceful solution of the crisis, he added.
</P>
<P>
Since the beginning of the crisis, China, as a permanent member
of the United Nations Security Council, has called on all parties
concerned to exercise a sober and restrained attitude and proposed
a settlement of the issue through dialogue and cooperation to
avoid escalating the crisis into armed conflict, Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
He said that China has closely consulted and cooperated with
all concerned parties and made constructive efforts to seek a
proper settlement of the crisis.
</P>
<P>
Although the crisis is escalating, China supports political and
diplomatic efforts and will continue to play a positive role to
seek a peaceful solution of the crisis, he said.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman stated China's stance remains unchanged, that it
opposes the use of force to resolve the crisis.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese hope that concerned parties will take a flexible
and restrained attitude to settle the crisis, the spokesman said.

<HEADLINE> HK to Be Well Positioned for Information Age: Tung </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, February 12 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong needs to have
itself well prepared for the upcoming Information Age in the 21st
century, a top official of the Special Administrative Region (SAR)
government said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
At the opening ceremony of the first Hong Kong Information
Infrastructure Exposition and Conference, the SAR's Chief
Executive Tung Chee Hwa said: "Information technology will shape
the 21st century ...we must ensure that Hong Kong is well placed
to reap the benefits of this move."
</P>
<P>
"We cannot underestimate the challenges and opportunities
afforded us by the Information Age. They will be as momentous in
their way as the Industrial Revolution some one hundred or so
years ago," said Tung.
</P>
<P>
Information technology will enhance Hong Kong's
competitiveness, sustain its economic growth, improve services,
upgrade quality of life, said Tung. But he stressed: "It is now
enough for the experts to be prepared for the Information Age. We,
Hong Kong as a whole, must be ready for its coming and ready to
master it. We must master information technology or else it will
become our master."
</P>
<P>
Tung has taken it as one of his administration's key tasks to
push forward the development of information infrastructure in Hong
Kong.
</P>
<P>
In his first Policy Address in October 1997, Tung announced
that one bureau secretary would coordinate the SAR government work
in information technology, broadcasting and telecommunications.
</P>
<P>
The SAR government announced Wednesday that the restructured
Information Technology and Broadcasting Bureau would undertake the
important task to help lead Hong Kong into the Information Age.
</P>
<P>
Besides, the SAR government would allocate 2.5 billion HK
dollars (320 million US dollars) to provide information technology
facilities for schools and for training of teachers.
</P>
<P>
Recently, the government has reached an agreement with Hong
Kong Telecom to put an end to the company's monopoly on Hong
Kong's international telephone services, a move to encourage
further competition on telecommunications market.
</P>
<P>
But Tung said Thursday: "This is just a taste of what is
happening now, a mere foreshadowing of things to come."
</P>
<P>
The four-day Information Infrastructure Exposition and
Conference, the first of its kind ever held in Hong Kong, is aimed
to promote the public understanding of the information technology
and its impact on people's lives.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Seeks Investment for Mineral Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, February 12 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian President
Benjamin Mkapa has encouraged businessmen from both at home and
abroad to invest in the development of mineral resources in the
country, The Guardian said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Opening a two-day dialogue for chief executives of mining
companies in north Tanzania's Arusha Wednesday, Mkapa said
Tanzania boasts both abundant natural resources and social
stability.
</P>
<P>
Tanzania is rich in gold, diamonds, rubies and other
gemstones, as well as nickel, copper, cobalt and other mineral
resources, Mkapa told more than 300 chief executives from local
and foreign mining companies.
</P>
<P>
The east African country also takes pride in peace, political
stability and social harmony and concord since independence in
1961, he said.
</P>
<P>
The creation of a sound macro-economic management system is
also an important factor, the paper quoted president as saying.
</P>
<P>
Other favorable factors include an internationally
competitive, predictable and legal and fiscal framework, good
governance as well as the government's persistent fight against
corruption.
</P>
<P>
The government has grown aware of dealing with problems in
infrastructure facilities, education, the president said.
</P>
<P>
The government will remove all bottlenecks for investors to
operate smoothly in the mining sector, the president assured.
</P>
<P>
In order to improve Tanzania's global competitiveness in
trade, the president said, the government has repealed the
restrictive National Investment (Promotion and Protection) Act of
1990, replacing it with the Tanzanian Investment Act of 1997 last
October.
</P>
<P>
The government approved, in its October 1997 session, a new
special fiscal package for the mining sector as a further
testimony to the country's commitment to encourage private
investment in that sector, he said.
</P>
<P>
Clauses of the new package include full exemption on sales tax
and import and export and excise duties on equipment directly
related to mineral exploration, development and production,
according to the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
The Tanzanian government is paying greater attention to the
development of minerals. According to official sources,
Tanzania's mineral sector is currently contributing 1.4 percent
of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) up from a mere 0.5 percent in
the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
The meeting is sponsored by the World Bank in collaboration
with local financial institutions, mining companies and the IPP
Group of Companies.

<HEADLINE> 50 Most Competitive Cities Serve as Economic, Social Powerhouses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 12 (Xinhua) -- The 50 most competitive cities
in China account for 27.1 percent of the country's Gross Domestic
Product, and serve as the locomotive for social development,
according to the State Statistical Bureau (SSB).
</P>
<P>
The conclusion was drawan after a survey on 219 Chinese cities
at or above prefecture-level.
</P>
<P>
The SSB graded the 50 cities into two tiers in terms of their
economic force and social development.
</P>
<P>
The first tier incorporates 19 cities, namely Shanghai,
Beijing, Guangzhou, Tianjin, Shenyang, Wuhan, Nanjing, Dalian,
Shenzhen, Hangzhou, Harbin, Chengdu, Chongqing, Xi'an,
Shijiazhuang, Changchun, Qingdao, Jinan and Changsha.
</P>
<P>
In the second tier of 31 cities are some capitals of big inland
provinces and three special economic zones -- Xiamen, Shantou and
Zhuhai.
</P>
<P>
The SSB said the indexes for the development of economy,
education, science and technology in the 50 cities are far higher
than the average of China's urban areas and they have become
China's high-tech industrial bases.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Congress Committee Probes Air Disaster </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 12 (Xinhua) -- A House of Representative
committee has begun its investigation of the February 2 crash of
Cebu Pacific Flight 387 in which 104 people were killed, local
press reported on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The report said the committee found a route deviation by the
plane was a major factor leading to the worst air disaster, but so
far no body has claimed responsibility for the approval of the
detour.
</P>
<P>
The ill-fated plane made a stopover in Tacloban city en its
route from Manila to Cagayan de Oro city in the south. But the
detour forced it to fly an abandoned route which includes several
high mountain peaks blanketed by thick clouds.
</P>
<P>
Testifying at Wednesday's hearing, Air Transportation Office
chief Carlos Tanega blamed the Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB) for
allowing the illegal stopover, saying his office was not informed
of the flight diversion.
</P>
<P>
"We are not aware that plane was a diverted flight...We thought
it was regular flight to Tacloban," Tanega said.
</P>
<P>
However, Tanega's testimony contradicted Transportation
Secretary Josefina Lichauco's early statement, saying Tanega had
admitted to her the ATO approved the altered route to Tacloban.
</P>
<P>
"It was one of the first things I asked Tanega and he answered
in the affirmative, and the next question therefore is whether the
passengers had been informed about such a deviation to Tacloban
and here, my preliminary information is that they were not," she
said.
</P>
<P>
CAB flight operation chief Leticia Dumlao justified the
diversion as a technical landing, but she failed to explain why
she allowed the detour which violated the Contract of Carriage
between the passengers and the airline.
</P>
<P>
The Cebu Pacific management asserted that the plane secured the
ATO approval for its flight plan and the technical stopover was
announced to the passengers before the plane took off.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, rescue operations were still undergoing at the crash
site, but at a very slow speed because of bad weather. Rescuers
had retrieved 92 bags filled with body parts of the victims.

<HEADLINE> IMF: Manila Least Affected in Asian Currency Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 12 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary Fund
(IMF) Thursday reiterated that the Philippines was the least
affected amid the Asian currency crisis due to solid progress made
by the government.
</P>
<P>
An IMF report reaching here said that despite the peso
devaluation and soaring interest rates, the Philippines' fourth
quarter gross domestic product grew 4.7 percent, taking the
full-year figure to 5.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
"That comfortably exceeded the IMF's forecast of 4.4 percent in
1997, representing the fourth consecutive year of high growth,"
the report said.
</P>
<P>
It added that because the country did not experience the decade
of high growth rates enjoyed by some of its neighbors, "the
financial sector excesses are not as pronounced, and in
particular, banks' exposure to the property sector has been
correspondingly low."
</P>
<P>
The report also said that the Philippine government succeeded
in introducing a raft of deregulation, privatization and
comprehensive tax reforms to ensure dependable revenues under the
IMF's tutelage.
</P>
<P>
The multi-national institution that whoever is the successor of
President Fidel Ramos in June this year will inherit an economy
less buffeted by the Asian currency crisis than its neighbors.
</P>
<P>
At present, an IMF mission is in the country to review the
economy and discuss with the government its graduation from the
IMF's 35 years of supervision by March this year.
</P>
<P>
The IMF also said that the Philippines will soon open talks
with the fund for a new facility of about 2.7 billion U.S.
dollars. The facility is a pre-cautious arrangement and would be
withdrawn when the country's financial situation suddenly worsens.

SHANGHAI, February 12 (Xinhua) -- The mayor of east China's
Shanghai municipality, Xu Kuangdi, told the first session of the
11th Municipal People's Congress today that the Pudong New Area
should open wider to the outside world and use foreign investment
in a more efficient way.
</P>
<P>
Xu said that the area should get more financial organizations,
headquarters of large firms, and markets for production to move to
the area. Foreign banks doing Renminbi business and Sino-overseas
cooperative foreign trade firms will be further encouraged as
well, he added.
</P>
<P>
Export-oriented processing and cargo transport in the
Waigaoqiao Bonded Zone will be expanded, and construction work on
other new industrial bases like the Lujiazui finance trade zone
and the Jinqiao export processing zone, will speed up.
</P>
<P>
The new area has taken shape after five years of construction
work, he noted, and its GDP has increased 23.8 percent annually for
the past five years.
</P>
<P>
It has approved 4,900 foreign-funded projects, with a total
investment of 23.8 billion US dollars.

<HEADLINE> Philippines' Debt to Rise Sharply in 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 12 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government has
projected that its debt this year will rise by 35.7 percent to
170. 4 billion pesos (4 billion U.S. dollars) due to the currency
crisis.
</P>
<P>
Local newspaper Business World Thursday reported that the
forecast was based on the assumption that the average exchange
rate for 1998 will be 42 pesos per dollar.
</P>
<P>
The higher debt burden will come amid expected pressures from
the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for the state to produce a
hefty fiscal surplus by yearend.
</P>
<P>
The report said the projected debt figure had been presented to
an IMF mission who was here to decide the country's possible exit
by March from 35 years of IMF tutelage.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the country's debt burden was estimated at 125.6
billion pesos.
</P>
<P>
Of the planned total debt burden for 1998, some 63 percent will
be domestic debt and the rest foreign debt. This means that the
country would rely more on domestic borrowings by selling
government securities to meet its fiscal surplus target.
</P>
<P>
National treasurer Caridad Valdehuesa said the increase in the
debt would impact on the national government's ability to achieve
a fiscal surplus this year.
</P>
<P>
"If domestic revenues exceed domestic and foreign debt, well
and good, but if there is a shortfall, the first line of defense
should be to cut down on expenditures," she said.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the government ended up with a one-billion-peso
budget surplus from an earlier-projected 16 billion due to
depressed revenues from import-related taxes and higher interest
payments.

<P>
SHANGHAI, February 12 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai, China's financial
and industrial center, will strictly control construction of
high-grade, open-market housing in next three years, according to
Mayor Xu Kuangdi.
</P>
<P>
Xu emphasized today that, at the same time, Shanghai will build
houses at fairly low prices to meet the needs of families with
different incomes.
</P>
<P>
In the past five years Shanghai completed 57 million square
meters of new houses for a per-capita average of nine square
meters of living space for each resident.
</P>
<P>
Xu said during the on-going first session of the Shanghai
Municipal People's Congress that Shanghai will accelerate the
reconstruction of old residential quarters, dismantle 3.65 million
square meters of rundown houses, and build a series of residential
quarters between the ring areas.
</P>
<P>
By the year 2000, every resident will possess 10 square meters
of living space, he noted. Concerning questions on housing reform,
Xu said efforts will be made to invigorate the real estate market
and regulate real estate management.

<HEADLINE> Britain: Use of Force Against Iraq Not Decided </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, February 12 (Xinhua) -- Minister of State at the British
Foreign Office Derek Fatchett has said that no decision on the use
of force against Iraq has been taken yet.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Egyptian Al Ahram newspaper published on
Thursday, the British official said that the military action,
however, "could not be excluded" if Iraqi President Saddam Hussein
refused to yield to the will of the world.
</P>
<P>
Fatchett will arrive here Thursday for a brief visit to Egypt
within the context of a tour of the area that has so far taken him
to Oman and the United Arab Emirates.
</P>
<P>
His talks during the tour cover Iraq's crisis with the United
Nations and the British efforts that aimed at reaching a
diplomatic solution to the crisis, he told the Arabic daily.
</P>
<P>
The United States and Britain have been preparing for a
military strike against Iraq over its denial of full access of the
United Nations arms inspectors to the sites suspected of hiding
lethal weapons.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi Foreign Minister Mohamed Saeed Al-Sahhaf said here
Wednesday that Iraqi decided to open eight presidential sites,
which he said mean all monitoring sites, to international arms
experts appointed by the U.N. secretary general.
</P>
<P>
Britain has rejected the plan and expressed its solidarity with
the U.S. in case Washington makes true on its threat of military
punishment over Baghdad's alleged failure to comply with the
U.N. Security Council resolutions.
</P>
<P>
"Britain supports the diplomatic initiatives of Russia and the
Arab League to solve the crisis. But we should be ready for
military action if diplomacy failed to help the U.N. inspectors
return to Iraq and carry out their mission," he said.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has to comply with all the U.N. resolutions that stipulate
the U.N. inspectors be allowed to complete their mission, he
said. Otherwise a tough stand should be adopted towards Baghdad's
intransigence, he added.
</P>
<P>
Later in the day, Fatchett will hand over a message to Egyptian
President Hosni Mubarak from British Prime Minister Tony
Blair. The British diplomat will also meet with Foreign Minister
Amr Moussa and the Arab League chief Esmat Abdel Meguid on the
regional issues.

<P>
BAGHDAD, February 12 (Xinhua) -- 500 Iraqi prisoners of war
(POWs) detained in Iran will arrive in Baghdad by road within a
few days, Iraqi newspaper "Al-Zaoraa", organ of Iraq's
Journalists Union, said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The paper added that the National Association for the Prisoners
of War Affairs, formed by the Iraqi National Assembly
(parliament), is now getting prepared to welcome the new batch of
POWs.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian authorities are expected to set free more Iraqi
POWs following the successful talks recently with Iraqi Foreign
Minister Mohammed Saeed Al-Sahhaf in Tehran.
</P>
<P>
The two countries fought a bloody war between 1980-88. The
issue of POWs is a main obstacle to the normalization of relations
between the two countries. Iraq claimed that about 18,000 Iraqi
POWs are detained in Iran and called on Iran to set free all of
them.

NAIROBI, February 12 (Xinhua) -- The European Union will spend
six billion Shillings on the reconstruction of Nairobi-Mombasa
and the Nairobi-Nakuru roads, both key to the road transport
between coastal Kenya to inland and other Great Lakes countries.
</P>
<P>
After the current emergency work on the strategic roads is
over, tendering for the major work will start mid this year and
the actual work at the beginning of next year.
</P>
<P>
The EU will also finance a feasibility study on the section of
the Great North Road to Uganda to be financed by various donors,
the Daily Nation reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
EU head of delegation Lutz Sulzmann said that, however, the
Kenyan government would be expected to meet certain standards of
road maintenance first.
</P>
<P>
The Kenyan government must enforce the law on weight capacity
as overloaded vehicles damage the roads before their projected
life span, he said after signing an agreement for the financing
with Minister of Public Works Kikalya Kones.
</P>
<P>
Money collected from motorists as road maintenance levy must
be managed by the ministry of public works to ensure
transparency, he added.

Another 750 million Shilling project under the funding of EU
would commence next Wednesday for Eastern province, he revealed.

<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, February 12 (Xinhua) -- Egypt has reiterated that
resorting to force in resolving the current U.N.-Iraq standoff
will lead to dire consequences.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian Presidential Political Advisor Osama Al Baz,
addressing a youth gathering organized Wednesday night, stressed
that Egypt is in favor of a political solution to this crisis, the
Middle East News Agency reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
He strongly blasted the U.S. hardline policy towards Iraq and
said Egypt is working together with Iraq and "other active
countries" such as Russia, France and China in quest of a peaceful
solution to the Iraqi crisis that preserves Iraq's dignity.
</P>
<P>
Baz urged on both Iraq and the United Nations to seek a
political solution to this crisis, warning that resorting to force
will lead to dire consequences.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the Egyptian cabinet has decided to set up a
five-member committee to draw up a plan in case that the
threatened U.S. military action against Iraq materialize.
</P>
<P>
"This aims to protect the Egyptian expatriates (in Iraq)
against any negative likelihoods," Information Minister Safwat
el-Sheif said after the Cabinet Wednesday held lengthy discussions

<P>
The committee will be composed of ministers of the interior,
transport, social affairs and manpower and the foreign minister.

<P>
On Wednesday, Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak warned that
there appears no relaxation of a military threat against Iraq as
the U.S. is augmenting its military presence in the Gulf.

"What I fear is Iraq coming under a strike for failure to
implement the U.N. resolutions. and no one would then be able to
prevent the U.S. from mounting such a blow," Mubarak told
reporters on the possibility of a military option.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and Britain have been preparing for a military strike
against Iraq over its rejection of full access to the U.N. arms
inspection team to its presidential sites suspected of hiding
lethal weapons, and its demand for reorganization of the

<HEADLINE> Norwegians Set Records in Winter Olympics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAGANO, Japan, February 12 (Xinhua) -- Norwegian skiier and skater
Bjoern Daehlie and Aadne Sondral set records on the sixth day of the
18th Olympic Winter Games with victories in the men's 10km cross country
skiing classical race and the men's 1,500m speed skating on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
In the day's first medal event, Daehlie held off bad weather and
other medal contenders to cross the finish line with a winning time of
27 minutes and 24.5 seconds.
</P>
<P>
With the victory, Daehlie became the first male athlete to win six
Winter Olympic golds and the second to have such achievement. Lidia
Skoblikova, women skater from former Soviet Union, collected a total
of six golds in 1960 and 1964 Winter Games.
</P>
<P>
Markus Gandler of Austria was second with eight seconds behind and
Italian Mika Myllylae, gold medal winner in Monday's 30km classical
race, was third with further 15.6 seconds behind.
</P>
<P>
National hero Daehlie, who finished a disappointing 20th in the
men's 30km, led at every split of the race and collapsed in exhaustion
at the finish line.
</P>
<P>
Daehlie had trained hard in his career. In his 1997 autobiography,
he estimated that he covered 150,000 kilometers on skis, foot or
cycling over the previous decade --the equivalent of alomost four
trips round the world.
</P>
<P>
Philip Boit, the only athlete representing Kenya which makes its
debut at Winter Olympics, finished 50th in 47 minutes and 25.5
seconds, a time that Daehlie Bjoern could finish the distance two
times.
</P>
<P>
While in the ice rink of M-Wave, Sondral smashed the world record
of the 1,500m speed skating as well as Dutch's hope of the title.
</P>
<P>
Sondral, armed with flap skates, was timed one minute and 47.87
seconds to win the race, beating three Dutch rivals to the lower
placings.
</P>
<P>
Ids Postmas was second at 1:48.13 and another Dutch skater Rintje
Ritsma, who set the world mark of 1:48.88 last December, finished
third at 1:48.52.
</P>
<P>
Braving steady rain in mountains, Larissa Lazutina of Russia won
the women's 10km cross country skiing free pursuit at 46 minutes and
6.9 seconds.
</P>
<P>
The Russian skiier spent three Olympics and six years to win her
first Olympic gold medal, but it took her only five days to win her
second one.
</P>
<P>
In the women's 5km cross country skiing classical race on Monday,
she held off strong Norwegian rivals and heavy snow to win the title.
</P>
<P>
With the win in the pursuit, she became the only ahthlete who has
collected two gold medals at the current games.
</P>
<P>
The men's and women's snowboarding halfpipe event were taken by
Swiss and German boarders. Gian Simmen scored 85.2 points to win the
men's event for Switzerland and Nicola Thost came first at 74.6 points
in the women's discipline.
</P>
<P>
Bad Weather continued to have its say in competiton, forcing the
cancellation of two Alpine events, the men's downhill and combined
downhill. The two events were re-scheduled for Friday.
</P>
<P>
Canadian snowboarder Ross Rebagliati was questioned by Japanese
police on Thursday. Rebagliati was disqualified and stripped of men's
giant slalom gold medal by the International Olympic Committee after
being tested positive for marijuana.
</P>
<P>
The IOC said this morning that it was will to cooperate with
investigation by Japanese police of the case. "I can see no reason
why the IOC wouldn't cooperate with the local authorities," Michele
Verdier, IOC's spokesperson said at a press briefing.
</P>
<P>
The Canadian delegation has appealing to the case, and the Sports
Arbitration Penal will make a decision within today.
</P>
<P>
After six day competitions, Germany roared to the top of the medal
standings with four golds, four silvers and four bronzes. Russia was
second at four golds and three silvers. Winter sports powerhouse
Norway was third at three golds.

<HEADLINE> Sondral Sets World Record, Wins 1,000 Event </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAGANO, Japan, February 12 (Xinhua) -- Norwegian Aadne Sondral beat
his strong Dutch rivals won the men's 1,000-meter speed skating gold
medal and set a new world record Thursday at the Nagano Winter Olympic
Games.
</P>
<P>
Sondral skated one minute 47.78 for his first Olympic gold, edging
Dutchman Rintje Ritsma, who set the previous world mark of 1:48.88
last December in the Netherlands, to third with 1:48.52.
</P>
<P>
The Sondral's new world record was second created at the current
Olympic speed Skating at the "M-Wave" rink, where the first world
record was created since new slap skates had been used.
</P>
<P>
Gianni Romme, also from the Netherlands, rewrote the first world
speed skating record of the men's 5,000 meters last Sunday at the
Olympics, which opened last Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Ritsma's countryman Ids Postma, who ranked second at World Cup,
just behind Ritsma, took the silver by clocking 1:48.13.
</P>
<P>
All three broke the old mark, but sondral was the best and the
surprise winner although he said he was going to win the race before
the Games.
</P>
<P>
The 26-year-old, fourth finisher for the event in Lillehammer in
1994 when the speed skating was dominated by Norwegian superstar
Johann Olav Koss, skated in inner lane against Postma in the last
second of 23 pairs and looked to break the record after he finished
1,000 meters in 1:19.08, the best and same time with his strong
contender Postma at the stage.
</P>
<P>
The Norwegian, however, pulled away with a spectacular dash and was
time of only 27.92 seconds, compared with Postma's 28.12 seconds, in
last 500 meters to seal the victory.
</P>
<P>
"I said I am going to win the gold, and now I did. I am so happy,"
said the father of a one year old child. "I want to send it (gold
medal) to my mother."
</P>
<P>
"It was the best race I've ever done. For me, it's very important
to have enough speed in the first 300 meters. I concentrated really
hard on that. That's why I used both my arms in the first turn. Ids is
normally a good opener, so I knew if I stayed close to him, I would be
OK."
</P>
<P>
Sondral injured in October, 1996, during training in Inzell, and
was not back in full shape until January, 1997. But he skated a good
season and ranks third now at World Cup.
</P>
<P>
Postma was a bit disappointed with his silver, saying "I thought I
could have won the gold, but in the last curve, I had some problems. I
had a good race, but Aadne was faster. It was a very fast race."
</P>
<P>
The much more disappointed was Ritsma, the world champion and first
place in the World Cup rankings.
</P>
<P>
Known variously as "Tarzan, Alollo and Superman" by his adoring
fans, Ritsma skated against Kevin Overland of Canada at outer lane in
the last pair and had slower start with 24.36 seconds, compared with
Postsma's 23.85 and Sondral's 24.00. He came back to surpassed over
Overland but not enough to reach his gold medal goal.
</P>
<P>
Overland placed only 20th with a slow time of 1:52.07. Another
Dutchman Jan Bos was fourth in 1:49.75, one of three skaters breaking
the 1:50 barrier for Thursday's race.

<HEADLINE> Info Tech Firms Capture Bulk of U.S. Venture Capital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, February 11 (Xinhua) -- Venture capital firms in
the United States invested 11.4 billion dollars in 1,848
U.S. companies last year, according to a San Francisco-based
research firm.
</P>
<P>
Of the biggest beneficiaries, Silicon Valley absorbed a record
3.6 billion dollars of pension fund and other institutional money,
and in the San Francisco Bay area 592 firms received 3.8 billion
dollars, up 37 percent over 1996. The two areas captured 65
percent of the national total.
</P>
<P>
Nationwide, reported VentureOne, a leading provider of
information and analysis on the venture capital industry, the
picture was similar last year although the growth rate of 16
percent is less than what it was in Silicon Valley and the Bay
area.
</P>
<P>
Investments on communications, Internet and other information
technology companies accounted for 62 percent of the national
total venture money, said VentureOne, adding that the sector
accounted for all the growth in U.S. venture investments. These
totaled 7 billion dollars last year.
</P>
<P>
Information technology firms in the Bay area absorbed as many
as 78 percent of local venture investments in the past year. In
1996, IT firms also captured the dominant share of the venture
investment dollars, accounting for 60 percent. It took 47 percent
of the venture money in 1995.

<HEADLINE> U.S. May Suspend Mediation Efforts: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 12 (Xinhua) -- The United States may
suspend mediating the Israeli-Palestinian peace talks, if the two
sides refuse to accept its proposal on Israeli redeployment in
the West Bank, a newspaper report disclosed Thursday.
</P>
<P>
In a front-page story, local newspaper The Jerusalem Post
reported that Washington may take the step if the current talks
held between U.S. officials and Israeli and Palestinian
negotiators in Washington fail to achieve a breakthrough.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Cabinet Secretary Danny Naveh and Palestinian
negotiator Saeb Erekat are currently in Washington to conduct
talks with U.S. officials.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Middle East peace envoy Dennis Ross met Wednesday with the
two sides, which agreed to continue negotiations in the region
next week under the supervision of U.S. Ambassador to Israel
Edward Walker.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted Israeli officials as saying that the U.S. is
trying to press Israel and the Palestinian side to accept its
"bridging proposal" on a double-digit redeployment in the West
Bank within three months.
</P>
<P>
The proposal demands Israel transfer 13 percent of Area C
under total Israeli control to Area A under total Palestinian
control; of this, 2 percent should be transferred to the
Palestinian National Authority (PNA) immediately, and the rest
would be transferred over 90 days according to the PNA's
fulfillment of its obligations.
</P>
<P>
Besides the above-mentioned redeployment, there will be an
additional Israeli redeployment from sections of Area B, where
Israel retains security control but is under PNA civilian
authority.
</P>
<P>
The report said U.S. officials had confirmed that if the two
sides' positions remain too far apart, Washington may call a
time-out on its mediation efforts.
</P>
<P>
The report added that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu fears that if the peace talks break down, the U.S. will
not only cease its mediation efforts, but also will begin
re-evaluating its entire position on the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
Erekat said in Washington Wednesday that the Palestinian side
had rejected a U.S. proposal for an Israeli withdrawal from the
West Bank and called the suggested percentages "unrealistic."
</P>
<P>
Marwan Kanafani, PNA President Yasser Arafat's spokesman who
also attended the Washington talks, complained about the
reluctance of the U.S. and international community to increase
pressure on Israel.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, PNA deputy head Mahmoud Abbas (Abu Mazen) said
Wednesday that the PNA would continue to demand full
implementation of the Oslo peace accords.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in Moscow at the end of his Russian visit, Abbas
called on Russia to increase involvement in the peace process in
order to achieve a just compromise.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Teachers' Strike for Compensation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 12 (Xinhua) -- Israeli parents started
Thursday to keep their children home from secondary schools for
two days to protest the Education Ministry's refusal to meet the
teachers' demands of compensation for after-school activities.
</P>
<P>
The Israel Parents Association (IPA) made the decision
following Wednesday's failure of conciliation between the
Secondary School Teachers Association (SSTA) and their employers.
</P>
<P>
Supported by secondary school teachers, the SSTA has for
several months requested the Education Ministry to pay extra money
for teachers who organize after-school activities and no
agreement has been reached till now by the two sides.
</P>
<P>
SSTA had organized several strikes during the past few months
aimed at forcing the Education Ministry to meet the teachers'
demands. Such strikes affected badly the education of students.
</P>
<P>
Efforts continued on Wednesday to get representatives of the
SSTA and their employers back to the negotiating table as the IPA
announced to keep school children home from Thursday, but the two
sides failed again to reach an agreement.
</P>
<P>
National Labor Court on Wednesday also refused a request by
the Union of Local Authority and the Education Ministry to order
the teachers to cancel the sanctions, asking the sides to give
the conciliation process another two weeks.
</P>
<P>
Criticizing the ministry's treatment towards teachers, IPA said
on Wednesday that its strike will be renewed next week if the
ministry still refuses to match the teachers' demands.
</P>
<P>
The Histadrut (national trade union) Teachers Union (HTU) also
organized several strikes in the past to support the SSTA. If it
organizes another strike for the same purpose, the entire
education system in Israel would b paralyzed again.
</P>
<P>
The Education Ministry blasted the IPA for calling this two-day
strike, saying the parents had no legal standing to take such
action, and called the teachers to return to conciliation.

<HEADLINE> Boeing Eyes Markets Beyond Asia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, February 11 (Xinhua) -- Asia is not the entire
focus of Boeing, which is eyeing Europe and other markets for its
jets, an official of the Seattle manufacturer said recently.
</P>
<P>
Tim Meskill, Boeing's market outlook manager, said that the
company has many options in the face of delayed orders from Asian
airlines.
</P>
<P>
Europe, where air traffic increased a surprising 10 percent
last year, seems to be Boeing's first market alternative.
</P>
<P>
Boeing expects the total number of its planes order in 1998 to
be near the 502 booked last year. Most will have to come from
outside Asia, earlier seen as the leading market.
</P>
<P>
European demand will come not only from established national
carriers but also from the smaller regional carriers emerging
through more liberal laws enacted by the European Community.
</P>
<P>
Charter operators that carry about half the passenger traffic
within Europe are also growing, Meskill said.
</P>
<P>
European airliners accounted for 63 percent of Boeing's
announced orders in 1997, although Europe is rival Airbus
industries' home territory.
</P>
<P>
Scandinavian Airline System and British Airways are among
Boeing's important customers, he added.
</P>
<P>
Aviation analysts say that Boeing's production problems and
delivery delays have given Airbus an advantage in European
orders.
</P>
<P>
The four-nation consortium also has the backing of French,
German, British and Spanish governments. Startup European airlines
could be pressed to choose the European manufacturer, which is
especially aggressive in pricing.
</P>
<P>
However, the analysts still expect Boeing to keep an upper
hand in the widebody race.
</P>
<P>
European charter operators are also expected to provide more
orders for Boeing.
</P>
<P>
Outside Europe, Meskill said, Central and South America offer
sales opportunities. Airlines there are growing steadily, but
mostly in regional service that require smaller jets.
</P>
<P>
Russia and the smaller states of the former Soviet Union could
also be a market in the long run, say the analysts, citing that
Russian air industry is not likely to expand rapidly to compete
with Boeing and Airbus.
</P>
<P>
An Russian airline will take delivery of its first Boeing 777
in April.
</P>
<P>
Meskill said that Boeing still does not know when the Asian
financial crisis will end and how long the delivery delays by
Asian airlines will last.

export-oriented agriculture because of its subtropical resources,
proximity to Hong Kong and Macao, and the vast inland market.
</P>
<P>
The province now has 1,527 overseas-funded enterprises in the
agriculture sector. It also has 489 export bases that use some 600
million US dollars annually and have exports valued at 12 billion
US dollars.
</P>
<P>
The boom in export-oriented agriculture has meant changes in
the province's mode of production and the development of more
modern agriculture, Ou says. One foreign-funded food products
factory in the city of Zhuhai, for example, established a
production base on 667 hectares of ground that was able to employ
thousands of farmers for help in growing fruits and vegetables.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 12 (Xinhua) -- China had a record 57.59
million overseas tourists in 1997, a rise of 12.6 percent over the
previous year. Overseas tourists include visitors from Hong Kong
and Macao.
</P>
<P>
Of the figure, the number of tourists who stay in China for
more than one day reached 23.77 million, up 4.4 percent. The
tourism index still ranks sixth in the world after France, the
United States, Spain, Italy, and Britain, the World Tourism
Organization said.
</P>
<P>
A total of 7.43 million foreigners visited the Chinese mainland
last year, up 10.1 percent. The number of Hong Kong and Macao
tourists reached 47.94 million, representing a year-on-year rise
of 12.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
China earned 12.07 billion U.S. dollars from overseas tourists
last year, up 18.4 percent, climbing to eighth place in the world
after the US, Italy, Spain, France, Britain, Germany and Austria.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a news conference today, He Guangwei, chairman of
the China National Tourism Administration (CNTA), said this showed
the success of Visit China '97, a state-level tourism promotion.
</P>
<P>
In 1997 the CNTA hosted the annual meeting of the Pacific-Asia
Travel Association (PATA) and a series of activities to celebrate
the return of Hong Kong to the motherland. In addition, 35 famous
scenic spots, 16 tourist itineraries, and 48 tourism festivals
were put forward to lure foreign visitors.

<HEADLINE> Ambassador on Sino-Yemeni Relations and Middle East Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 12 (Xinhua) -- The upcoming China visit by
President Ali Abdulla Saleh of the Republic of Yemen should
further strengthen the friendly relations and cooperation between
the two countries.
</P>
<P>
This view was expressed by Yemen's ambassador to China,
Mohammed Hadi Awad, in an exclusive interview with Xinhua here
today.
</P>
<P>
The purpose of the visit, scheduled to begin this weekend, is
to strengthen political ties as well as economic and trade
cooperation between Yemen and China, thus helping promote the
economic development of Yemen and improve the living conditions of
the Yemeni people, the ambassador said.
</P>
<P>
In history, Awad said, Yemen was a transit stop for exported
goods from China to Europe and a link between the East and the
West.
</P>
<P>
China once gave support to Yemen in its struggle against
British colonial rule and for national independence, while Yemen
is among the Arab nations that recognized the People's Republic of
China quickly, Awad said.
</P>
<P>
Starting in the 1950s, Awad said, cooperation between Yemen and
China has been growing and has expanded into trade, science,
technology, culture and other areas.
</P>
<P>
Chinese companies are now doing business in petroleum and
highway construction in Yemen and Chinese doctors are working in
some hospitals in Yemen. The Yemeni government has formulated
plans to encourage private and state-owned firms to cooperate with
Chinese businesses, the ambassador said.
</P>
<P>
At present, he added, more than 120 Yemeni students are
studying in China. Some Chinese schools have offered to help Yemen
with professional training.
</P>
<P>
Extending congratulations to China for the return of Hong Kong
and the scheduled return of Macao, Awad said Yemen hopes that
Taiwan will reunify with its motherland at an early date.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that the theories and philosophy of Deng Xiaoping,
through opening to the outside world and the initiative of 'one
country, two systems,' have born fruitful results in both economic
and political aspects," Awad said.
</P>
<P>
Yemen appreciates China's position to support the cause of the
Arabs and to safeguard the people's rights of seeking
independence, stability and development, he said.
</P>
<P>
On the Yemeni government's position on the Middle East peace
process, Awad said it is only when the occupied Palestinian and
Arab territories are returned that Middle East peace can be
realized.
</P>
<P>
The resolutions of the United Nations and the U.N. Security
Council on the Middle East should be implemented, and the
Palestinian people should regain their rights and build their
independent country on their own land, the ambassador said.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Backs Peaceful End of U.S.-Iraq Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, February 12 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria has warned of the
humanitarian effects any military attack by the United States
would have on innocent Iraqis and expressed readiness to support
a peaceful resolution of the current crisis.
</P>
<P>
"We believe in a peaceful resolution of the crisis," Minister
of State for Foreign Affairs Alhaji Buhari Bala said in the
capital Abuja Wednesday at a meeting with visiting Iraqi
Ambassador Taha Tachar Mohammed.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time Nigeria made public its stand on the
face-off between Iraq and the United States over the inspection
of sites for weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
According to the minister, Nigeria would not support any
country that manufactured trouble for its sake.
</P>
<P>
Whatever offence Iraq committed did not warrant military
action by any country without the mandate of the United Nations
Security Council, he said.
</P>
<P>
He warned the humanitarian effects of American attack as well
as its dire implication to world peace, the official daily New
Nigerian reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
While calling on the international community to ease up the
present sanction on Iraq, the minister said Nigeria will continue
to support Iraq within the framework of the United Nations
Security Council.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi envoy, according to the report, was in Abuja to
solicit the support of Nigeria for a peaceful resolution of the
crisis, with a letter to that effect from his government to
Nigeria.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Needs 23,000 Information Workers by 2002 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, February 12 (Xinhua) -- Companies with the
Multimedia Super Corridor (MSC) status in Malaysia will need some
23,000 knowledge workers in the year 2002, with 59 percent of them
in the information technology (IT) field, according to a survey.
</P>
<P>
For this year, the MSC-status companies require 6,728 knowledge
workers, according to the findings of a survey by the Multimedia
Development Corporation (MDC), which were distributed in
conjunction with the 2nd two-day MSC's International Advisory
Panel (IAP) Meeting starting in Cyberjaya near here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The IAP meeting, chaired by Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir
Mohamad and attended by several of the world's top information
technology (IT) chiefs, would discuss issues pertaining to the
development of the MSC and the IT/multimedia industry.
</P>
<P>
MDC Executive Chairman Othman Yeop Abdullah will give an update
on the MSC to the IAP members who would also be briefed by four
MSC-status companies on their operations.
</P>
<P>
Issues to be deliberated during the meeting include global
market trends in IT and cross-border issues such as the future of
electronic commerce.
</P>
<P>
The 44-member IAP, comprising multimedia industry leaders and
gurus, was formed to advise the Malaysian government on the MSC, a
750 square kilometer area, stretching from the Kuala Lumpur City
Center (KLCC) southwards to the new Kuala Lumpur International
Airport in Sepang, designated as a hub for the development of
multimedia products and services.
</P>
<P>
A total of 103 companies have so far been granted the MSC
status, with 80 already operating and 23 setting up their
operations.
</P>
<P>
According to the MDC which oversees the overall development of
the MSC project, the projected demand for knowledge workers next
year is 9,627, 12,616 for 2000 and 15,488 in 2001.
</P>
<P>
The survey also showed that the supply of knowledge workers in
the country would be more than sufficient to meet the needs of the
MSC as more than 25,000 workers would be available in the market
by 2002.
</P>
<P>
The Malaysian Ministry of Education has allocated 5 million
ringgit (1.4 million U.S. dollars) to produce 1,780 master
trainers and conduct IT courses for 30,000 trained primary and
secondary school teachers.
</P>
<P>
The ministry has also allocated 50 million ringgit (14 million
dollars) this year towards the development of Smart Schools.

<HEADLINE> Kenya Backs Diplomacy on Iraq: FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, February 12 (Xinhua) -- Kenya, a non-permanent member
of the U.N. Security Council, wants all diplomatic channels
exhausted before any other steps to resolve the U.S.-Iraq crisis,
Foreign Minister Bonaya Godana said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
However, he declined to clarify whether Kenya was willing to
provide important logistical support to a U.S.-led force as it
did in the 1991 Gulf War, local press reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"I don't think we have got to that stage," he said, stressing
the role of the U.N. as a guarantor of world peace and the need
to respect its resolutions.
</P>
<P>
"We must exhaust diplomacy before anybody thinks of
alternative approaches to resolve this conflict," he said.
</P>
<P>
In 1991, Kenya's airports and the port of Mombasa provided
vital support for a multinational force which pushed Saddam
Hussein's forces out of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
With the drums of war beating again over Iraq, the U.S. has
mounted a vigorous campaign to mobilize international support for
a possible military operation.
</P>
<P>
Bill Richardson, the U.S. ambassador to the U.N. and Marine
Corps General Anthony Zinni, commander of U.S. forces in the
Middle East, have visited Nairobi in the past month for talks
with President Daniel arap Moi.
</P>
<P>
The Kenya Times newspaper Thursday issued an editorial
charging that the U.S. administration "has an unhealthy attitude"
to the current Gulf crisis. The newspaper is run by the ruling
Kenya African National Union (KANU).
</P>
<P>
"The question of whether the U.S. has a right to behave as if
it was the world's policeman has been raised many times over by
U.S. critics from all corners of the globe," noted the editorial.
</P>
<P>
"The critics say America has no authority to control the
manner in which Iraq should conduct its self-defence policies nor
the kind of weapons it chooses to have in its arsenal," it
continued.
</P>
<P>
"Another explosion of violence in the Gulf region is something
few countries in the world would want to see," it concluded.

<HEADLINE> Kuwaitis Cope With Iraq Crisis, Reactions Mixed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, February 12 (Xinhua) -- The Kuwaiti government has
been stepping up preparation for a possible Iraqi retaliation if
U.S. military strikes against Iraq come true, but Kuwaitis have
shown mixed reactions to the current escalating crisis.
</P>
<P>
Some Kuwaitis expressed alarm at the military build-up and
preparations for a possible military confrontation in the region,
while many others carried on with their daily work without any
noticeable change.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and Britain have amassed a major military presence in
the Gulf and said military deployment for the attacks will be
completed in a week or so from now.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz indicated Wednesday
that Iraq will not retaliate at Kuwait if it comes under
U.S. attack, saying Baghdad did not have any plans or intentions
to strike anybody "except the aggressors."
</P>
<P>
However, Kuwait has put its 16,000 armed forces on high alert
and mobilized its 24,000 reserves. "Patriot" missiles are deployed
in strategic sites to guard against any missile attack from Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait has also taken several civil precautionary measures,
including importing gas masks, encouraging reserve donations to
blood banks, outlining contingency plans to distribute essential
foodstuffs and to guarantee water and electricity supplies.
</P>
<P>
It has also issued safety guidelines to the public and steps to
follow in case of a chemre preparing sealed or underground rooms in
their homes stocked with basic food, water, medicines and
charcoal enough for one-month or more as anti-chemical or
biological weapons shelters.
</P>
<P>
But life remains normal. A foreign diplomat here said "a high
level of nervousness in Kuwait is seen, but it is not panic."
</P>
<P>
The majority of Kuwaitis have abstained from stockpiling food
supplies as the authorities assured the people that there was no
need for panic.
</P>
<P>
People are taking advantage of the early spring season to
marry. Wedding ceremonies are being held everywhere in the country
during the night when relatives and friends go to extend their
good wishes to the new couples in well-lit Arabic traditional
tents.
</P>
<P>
"Latest developments require certain preparations but within
reason and in line with guidelines carried on newspapers and
broadcast by the media," a Kuwaiti said.
</P>
<P>
"Kuwait is OK, and the military preparations are assuring,"
his friend added, emphasizing that there was no need to store
large amounts of food supplies.
</P>
<P>
In addition, analysts here said, Kuwait is not involved in what
may be developing into a new military confrontation this time.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Funds Fueling Growth In China's Hydro-electric Power </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 12 (Xinhua) -- China has 23 hydropower
projects in operation or under construction by utilizing foreign
funds worth nearly 3.7 billion US dollars, with a total generating
capacity over 18.84 million kw.
</P>
<P>
"China has the richest hydro-electric power resources in the
world, with exploitable water energy resources estimated at 376
million kw, ranking first in the world," said Zhao Xizheng,
vice-minister of the electric power industry.
</P>
<P>
Zhao says that China has completed 13 hydropower projects with
a combined generating capacity of 5.62 million kw by using 1.44
billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
Five others, with a total capacity of 8.1 million kw, are being
built with 1.4 billion US dollars worth of foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
China has been developing its hydro-electric power industry for
four decades, but especially since the reforms and opening-up
drive began in 1979.
</P>
<P>
Total generating capacity and annual electricity output have
risen from 163,000 kw and 710 million kwh respectively, in 1949,
to today's 52.17 million kw and 186.8 billion kwh. This makes
China third in generating capacity and production in the world.
</P>
<P>
However, Zhao says, there is still a lot that needs to be done
to make use of China's enormous resources. Its total generating
capacity accounts for only 13.8 percent of what is possible.
</P>
<P>
According to China's medium- and long-range development plans,
it will have a capacity of 70 million kw by the year 2000, and by
2010, that will rise to 125 million kw, or 33.1 percent of the
country's exploitable hydro-electric power resources.
</P>
<P>
Zhao says that 3.5 million kw will be added annually, on
average, in the remaining years of the century, and from 2000 to
2010, hydro-electric power capacity will increase by five million
kw annually.

<HEADLINE> Beijing To Release Weekly Urban Air Quality Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 12 (Xinhua) -- Beijing plans to follow the
example of 27 other Chinese cities in releasing weekly urban air
quality reports for the general public, director of the National
Environmental Protection Agency (NEPA), Xie Zhenhua, told a press
conference today.
</P>
<P>
The municipal government in China's capital is placing great
emphasis on environmental protection, and although nitrogen
levels have risen since the 1980s because of the increase in the
number of automobiles, sulfur levels have remained the same, and
the amount of suspended particles has been declining.
</P>
<P>
According to a 41-week NEPA study, the city's air quality was
quite good for ten weeks in the summer, with slight pollution for
16 weeks; medium pollution for 14 weeks, and seriously pollution
for only one week.
</P>
<P>
An irrational industrial structure, rapid urban development,
and a growing population are all causes of growing environmental
pressures. There are more than 4,000 construction sites around the
city, which has grown 28 percent in size.
</P>
<P>
The weekly report will have an atmospheric pollution index for
sulfur dioxide, oxygen and nitrogen compounds, and amount of
suspended particles.
</P>
<P>
Major cities like Nanjing, Shanghai, and Wuhan have provided
these reports in the local media since last May.

<HEADLINE> Japan's Current Account Surplus Posts First Rise in Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, February 12 (Xinhua) -- Japan's current account surplus
in 1997 rose for the first time in four years from a year earlier,
up 59.8 percent to 11,435.7 billion yen (793 billion
U.S. dollars), the Finance Ministry said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The ministry attributed the increase to the strong growth in
exports, which outpaced increases in imports and a decline in
services trade reflecting fewer Japanese tourists traveling abroad.
</P>
<P>
Exports climbed by 13.7 percent to 49,517.2 billion yen (402
billion dollars), while imports rose by 7.9 percent to 37,188.0
billion yen (302 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
In goods and services trading, Japan registered a surplus of
5,803.1 billion yen (47 billion dollars), up 150.4 percent from a
year before, the ministry said in a preliminary report.
</P>
<P>
The surplus in merchandise trade grew by 35.5 percent to
12,329.1 billion yen (100 billion dollars), the first increase in
five years.
</P>
<P>
In services trade, including tourism, Japan posted a deficit of
6,526.0 billion yen (53 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
The current account balance measures the flow of goods and
services as well as investment and other monetary transfers.
</P>
<P>
For the month of December, Japan's current account surplus rose
by 57.4 percent from a year earlier to 1,295.6 billion yen (11.52
billion dollars), following a 91.8 percent jump in November.
</P>

The average exchange rate was 129.47 yen to the dollar in
December, compared with 113.81 yen a year earlier.

<HEADLINE> Madrid to Remit $600m Debt on Portuguese-Speaking </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, February 12 (Xinhua) -- Portugal would cut off the 600
million U.S. Dollar debt on five Portuguese-speaking countries in
Africa.
</P>
<P>
According to a report issued by the Organization of Economic
Co-operation and Development (OECD), the debt remission has
resulted in a gradual reduction in Portugal's development aid to
OECD, cutting it from the 258 million dollars in 1995 to the 218
million dollar in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Portugal has promised to keep its development aid to OECD at a
level of 0.36 percent of its Gross Domestic Product (GDP).
</P>
<P>
Portugal, which shares the same language with five African
countries like Angola, Mozambique, Sao Tom &AMP; Principe, Guinea
Bissau and Cape Verde, would strengthen its cooperation with the
five countries in education and in their effort to eliminate
illiteracy.
</P>
<P>
The OECD report said that though Portugal is trying to enlarge
its cooperation scale, these five former colonies are still the
main target in its foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
The report said that the biggest challenge Portugal is facing
is Angola and Mozambique, which need huge international aid in
their reconstruction after wars.

<HEADLINE> China to Build First Butyl Rubber Production Equipment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 12 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese petrochemical group
in March will begin to build the country's first butyl rubber
production equipment, which is able to turn out 30,000 tons of the
special rubber.
</P>
<P>
To date, Yanshan Petrochemical Group has completed
infrastructure preparation for the project including clearance of
the construction site and laying underground pipe lines.
</P>
<P>
As one of the key construction components of the Ninth
Five-Year Plan Period (1996-2000) designed by Sinopec, the project
should facilitate the development of China's auto industry.
</P>
<P>
Butyl rubber is an important material in manufacturing the
innertube of car tires, pharmaceutical products, and electric and
cable lines because of its airtight capacity.
</P>
<P>
The synthesization of the rubber is extremely demanding in
regard to pressure and temperature controls. The technology is now
controlled by a few countries.
</P>
<P>
The butyl rubber project is based on an agreement signed by
Sinopec and Italy's PI Corp. in 1996. According to the agreement,
the Chinese expect to import key parts of the equipment such as
generators from Italy, and bring in PI's expertise in butyl rubber
production.
</P>
<P>
The project is scheduled to start operations in November of
1999.
</P>
<P>
The current global production capacity of butyl rubber is
770,000 tons annually. China's yearly imports total 15,000 tons,
which is valued at 315 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
Experts predict China's demand for butyl rubber in 2000 will
reach 60,000 tons as a result of the growth of auto
industry.

<P>
BEIJING, February 12 (Xinhua) -- Official statistics show more
than 160,000 enterprises in China are involved in foreign trade
now.
</P>
<P>
For a long time foreign trade was the sole privilege of certain

By now, there are more than 7,800 industrial enterprises with
foreign trade rights and 295 scientific research institutions are
given such rights.

In 1997, these industrial enterprises and research institutions
with foreign trade rights exported 17.56 billion US dollars worth
of goods, up 33.2 percent from 1996, and accounting for 9.6
percent of China's total exports.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, February 12 (Xinhua) -- A private company, Africa
Insites, has been set up in Lusaka to offer information on
tourism in Zambia on the Internet, according to a local
newspaper.
</P>
<P>
The company which has already won approval by the Zambia
National Tourist Board and the Tourism Council of Zambia will
focus on comprehensive and up-to date information relating to
tourism, business and travel in the country.
</P>
<P>
The Post today quoted the firm's chief executive Robyn Curtis
as saying Wednesday that his company has set up a web guide on
Zambia comprising 200 pages with information ranging from
business to local culture.
</P>
<P>
"The information is supplemented by stunning color photos and
adverts of local tourism products and packages," said Curtis.
</P>
<P>
The company will operate on earnings derived from adverts
placed by tour operators, lodges and hotels whose brochures can
be advertised on the web guide.
</P>
<P>
The paper also quoted Africa Insites spokesman Jifipa Ngalande
as saying Wednesday in an interview that response from
advertisers have been overwhelming with some adverts being from
South Africa and England.
</P>
<P>
He said the initiative has been taken following complaints
about the difficulties of accessing information on Zambia from
around the world.
</P>
<P>
The advertising rates have been pegged at 250 U.S Dollars for
the whole year with incentives such as making amendments to the
running adverts when necessary, Curtis disclosed.
</P>
<P>
Africa Insites also offers companies and individuals with
their own web sites to be part of the information package by
listing them, at a cost of 100 dollars, in an appropriate section
to enable users get linked to their sites.
</P>
<P>
The firm's spokesman added that more and more people are using
the Internet to decide where to go on holiday and Zambia needs a
good web site to compete with the rest of the world as a holiday
destination.

<HEADLINE> China, Pakistan Hold Investment Forum in Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 12 (Xinhua) -- Economic and trade cooperation
between China and Pakistan is still far from fully developed
compared with the economic strength of the two countries and the
growth of bilateral political relations, Chinese Vice-Premier Wu
Bangguo told a Sino-Pakistan investment forum here today.
</P>
<P>
Visiting Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif also attended
the meeting and spoke.
</P>
<P>
The Conference on Investment Opportunities in Pakistan was
jointly held by the China Council for Promotion of International
Trade (CCPIT) and the Pakistani government.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the forum, Wu said that leaders of the two countries
Wednesday held fruitful talks and signed many important agreements
on cooperative projects. Today's forum is a major activity that
Prime Minister Sharif attended during his visit to Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Wu expressed the belief that Sharif's visit and the investment
forum will further promote economic and trade cooperation between
the two countries and lay a solid foundation for Sino-Pakistani
friendship for generations.
</P>
<P>
Wu said that in the past 47 years since the two countries
established diplomatic relations, they have conducted fruitful
cooperation in the fields of culture, science, technology, economy
and trade. He said that Pakistan has become a major trade partner
of China in South Asia, and that the momentum of two-way trade has
increased year by year.
</P>
<P>
However, he said that economic and trade cooperation between
the two countries is insufficient compared with their economic
strength and the pace of development of bilateral political
relations.
</P>
<P>
Wu said he believed that joint efforts by the governments and
people of the two countries would result in further consolidation
and development of the partnership of comprehensive cooperation
between China and Pakistan.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Australia Intensifies Diplomatic Solution to Gulf </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, February 12 (Xinhua) -- Australian Foreign Minister
Alexander Downer said Thursday Australia was intensifying its
diplomatic efforts for peacefully resolving the crisis between the
United States and Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Downer said he had asked Australia's Ambassador to the United
Nations Penny Wensley to reinforce Australia's support for a
diplomatic solution to other missions in New York where she is
based.
</P>
<P>
Downer's peace appeal came two days after Australian Prime
Minister John Howard's announcement of Australia's support for any
United States-led military operation against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Howard said Tuesday Australia still hopes military action will
not be necessary, but "If it does become necessary for a United
States-led coalition to use force then Australia has decided it
will make a contribution to that effort."
</P>
<P>
Downer said he had also asked key Australian representatives
around the world to intensify their contact with the concerned
governments and relevant international organizations.
</P>
<P>
"The government is now intensifying its diplomatic efforts to
try to encourage an appropriate and peaceful solution to the
crisis with Iraq," Downer was quoted by the Australian Associated
Press (AAP) as saying.
</P>
<P>
The Australian government's position has been under criticism
from politicians, charity groups and some other organizations.
</P>
<P>
Demonstrations or protests against war against Iraq will be
held in four major Australian cities Friday -- Sydney, Melbourne,
Canberra and Perth, capital of the coastal state of West
Australia, the AAP said.
</P>
<P>
An anti-Gulf War demonstration will be held at the U.S.
Consulate in Sydney Friday, the news agency said.

<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, February 12 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwe Congress of Trade
Unions (ZCTU) Wednesday said it will call a two-day national work
boycott on February 27 unless the government scraps 2.5 percent
increase in sales tax.
</P>
<P>
The tax are levied on goods and services, the development levy
and restore prices of basic commodities to pre-July 1997 levels.
</P>
<P>
ZCTU President Gibson Sibanda told more than 4,000 workers who
packed the large City Hall of Bulawayo, the country's second
largest city Wednesday evening that the organization had already
written to the government advising it of its intention to call
for a mass stayaway on February 27 if its demands were not met.
</P>
<P>
He said last December's countrywide mass protests which led to
the withdrawal of the proposed war veterans levy were the
beginning of the "ultimate goal of the liberation of workers"
throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
A statement released at the meeting said the major reason why
the country was not realizing its full potential was that
political consideration were over-riding rational economic
thinking.
</P>
<P>
"The political leadership has lost direction as it is mainly
concerned with preserving its power base through corruption to
the extent that it has relegated sound economic advise," it said.

BEIJING, February 12 (Xinhua) -- A nationwide inventory and

<HEADLINE> Performing Sea Lions at Aquarium Traumatized by Fireworks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QINGDAO, February 12 (Xinhua) -- Three sea lions, frightened by
the huge noise from firecrackers on the eve of the Chinese lunar
new year, have refused to perform in this port city in east
China's Shandong Province.
</P>
<P>
On Jan. 27, the four South American sea lions in the Dolphin
Hall at the Qingdao Aquarium got a big scare from noisy
firecrackers nearby which were among those allowed by city
authorities to set off firecrackers and fireworks.
</P>
<P>
After 10 days of treatment, one male sea lion has fully
recovered and been able to perform. However, the other three sea
lions have been so scared that, in addition to refusing to return
to the perorming stage, are experiencing physical symptoms such
as shuddering, roaring and diarrhea. They also hide in the water
when they hear any loud noise. And sometimes they refuse to eat.
</P>
<P>
Firecrackers and fireworks have been an integral part of the
new year celebrations and other occasions over the centuries
despite the inevitable fires and injuries.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, firecrackers and fireworks have been banned in
the downtown area in most of China's major cities, with the
exception of a few spots during the Spring Festival in some cities
such as Shanghai, Beijing and Qingdao. For many, it is too
important to be eliminated.
</P>
<P>
In the Chinese capital, authorities have reiterated the ban on
firecrackers and fireworks in the whole downtown area, since the
occurrence of fires and injuries from illegal fireworks during
this year's holiday were the highest since Beijing barred fire
crackers and fireworks five years ago.

<HEADLINE> Mugabe Reaffirms Land Reform Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, February 12 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwean government will
consider alternative ideas being offered to effectively deal with
the land acquisition programe, but will not accept anything that
will adversely affect its principal position on the issue,
President Robert Mugabe said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing hundreds of ruling ZANU (PF) supporters at the
party headquarters in Harare, Mugabe said, "we can not allow any
proposal to diminish the thrust for acquiring the size of land we
have stipulated as necessary for land acquisition."
</P>
<P>
Last year, the government announced to acquire about 1,500
farms or five million hectares for the resettlement exercise.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe has said the government would not compensate farmers
for land, but for improvements only.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe told his supporters, "the responsibility for
compensation is for the former colonial master. They should go
to Britain for that because we are not going back. This is not
politicking."
</P>
<P>
"We have neither a moral or legal obligation to pay them," he
said, adding, "Britain did not pay for that land, so they should
not renege on their obligation".
</P>
<P>
Mugabe made the remarks when he was commenting on the
Commercial Farmers Union (CFU) alternative resettlement plan
which would pave the way for farmers to release large tracts of
land.
</P>
<P>
The 4,500-member CFU unveiled an alternative plan after the
government announced its intention to acquire more than 1,500
farms for the resettlement exercise.
</P>
<P>
The CFU offered to release 1.5 million hectares of land now
and source about 15 billion Zimbabwean dollars (about 900 million
U.S. dollars) for the program.

One agreement was signed between Fiat and Gorky Automobile

<HEADLINE> China Sees Good Future For Economic Cooperation With Europe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 12 (Xinhua) -- Beijing's International Trade
News quotes Guo Zhong, of China's Ministry of Foreign Trade and
Economic Cooperation, as saying that China's rapid economic growth
and the importance attached by the European Union to China
relations mean that there is a bright future for Sino-European
economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Guo, who is in charge of Sino-European trade at the ministry's
European Affairs Department, says that Chinese customs statistics
show that Sino-European trade amounted to 43 billion US dollars in
1997, a 8.3 percent increase from 1996.
</P>
<P>
By September, 1997, there were 8,022 projects in China funded
by EU member countries, involving 30 billion US dollars worth of
investment. China imported 5,030 technology projects from the EU,
worth 35.25 billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
China and the EU has been cooperating in industry, energy,
environmental protection, and other sectors.
</P>
<P>
To date, EU member countries and their financial institutions
have extended 12.34 billion US dollars in government loans to
China.
</P>
<P>
Guo says that EU countries had economic growth last year and
the increased exports were a driving force behind that growth
because their governments continued their tightened financial
policies to help reach their goal of a unified currency.
</P>
<P>
The development of economic and trade with China is in their
interest, and China is willing to work together with them for
this, he says.

<TEXT>
<P>
NAGANO, Japan, February 12 (Xinhua) -- Norwegian Bjoern Daehlie
defeated bad weather and other medal contenders to win the men's 10km
classical cross country skiing at the 18th Olympic Winter Games here
on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Norwegian, the most successful cross country skiier in history,
was timed 27 minutes and 24.5 seconds in a steady rain.
</P>
<P>
Markus Gandler of Austria was second with eight seconds behind and
Italian Mika Myllylae, gold medal winner in Monday's 30km classical
race, was third with further 15.6 seconds behind.
</P>
<P>
National hero Daehlie, who finished a disappointing 20th in the
men's 30km, led at every split of the race and collapsed in exhaustion
at the finish line.
</P>
<P>
It was the sixth Olympic gold medal for the Norwegian, who also won
the event in Lillehammer, Norway four years ago.
</P>
<P>
However, Daehlie is still waiting for his seventh Olympic gold, a
record in Winter Olympic history.
</P>
<P>
"Of course, the victory today is fantastic, but I think I will
appreciate it more in a few years when I'm a grandfather and watching
old videos," the 30-year-old skiier said.
</P>
<P>
Daehlie had trained hard in his career. In his 1997 autobiography,
he estimated that he covered 150,000 kilometers on skis, foot or
cycling over the previous decade --the equivalent of alomost four
trips round the world.
</P>
<P>
"I am very happy with the race today," he added.
</P>
<P>
Daehlie credited his victory to his mother, who gave some advice
after the 30km race.
</P>
<P>
"She said that I think you have forgotten something," the Norwegian
recalled. "It's to go a little bit faster than the others. Then you
will win."
</P>
<P>
Myllylae believed that mistakes in choosing correct skis and wax
caused his gold today.
</P>
<P>
"We had some problems in choosing skis and grip wax today," he
said. "But there were many skiiers that had the same problems. Many
skiiers were running away from the track."
</P>
<P>
Philip Boit, the only athlete from Kenya who makes debut at Winter
Olympics, managed to finish the race and came in the last at 47:25.5.
</P>
<P>
"My aim is to compete here and learn from others," he said.

<HEADLINE> Summer Palace Nominated for UNESCO World Heritage List </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 12 (Xinhua) -- Roland Silva, chairman of
UNESCO's Council of International Historical Sites and Ruins, is
doing a study of the Summer Palace in Beijing, which has been
nominated for inclusion on the World Heritage List.
</P>
<P>
The Summer Palace, located in the northwestern part of Beijing,
is China's largest imperial garden, attracting 40-to-50 million
visitors a year.
</P>
<P>
The palace was first built in 1750 by the government of the
Qing Dynasty. Then it was destroyed twice, first by British and
French soldiers in 1860 and then by troops jointly sent by Great
Britain, the United States, Germany, France, tsarist Russia,
Japan, Italy and Austria in 1900.
</P>
<P>
The palace was renovated in 1902, and became a public garden in
1924.
</P>
<P>
After new China was founded in 1949 the buildings, relics,
plants, hills and lakes were put under national
protection. Today's Summer Palace covers an area of 290 hectares,
with the water area accounting for three quarters of that.
</P>
<P>
More than 40,000 relics are housed in the Summer Palace,
ranging from the bronzeware of the Shang Dynasty (1600-1100 BC) to
the handicrafts of the late Qing Dynasty (1644-1911).
</P>
<P>
The park has set up files for the relics, as well as 70,000
square meters of ancient buildings and 1,622 trees more than 200
years old.
</P>
<P>
Each year some of the ancient buildings will be repaired
according to the plans drawn up by experts and approved by
cultural relics departments. Related departments have also drafted
regulations on the buildings' position, color, height and material
surrounding the Summer Palace.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has applied for the inclusion of the
Summer Palace and the Temple of Heaven on the World Heritage List
of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural
Organization. So far, China has 19 sites on the list, including
the Great Wall and the Forbidden City.

<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, February 12 (Xinhua) -- The capital of China's
Guangdong Province reported a GDP of 164.3 billion yuan in 1997,
an increase that, at 13.5 percent, was higher than both the
national and provincial average.
</P>
<P>
Consumer goods did more than 80.3 billion yuan in business last
year, a year-on-year increase of 16.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, the city has used more than 2.5 billion US
dollars worth of overseas investment in real terms annually, and
expects to see more coming in.
</P>
<P>
For the last two decades, Guangzhou has tried different forms
of ownership and tried many forms of economy and now, the private
sector has come to account for 30 percent of its economic growth.
</P>
<P>
The city's Party Secretary Gao Siren says the good economy
comes from the market economy and the law of value, as well as the
introduction of shares to its enterprise reforms early in 1985.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Guangzhou raised 60 to 70 billion yuan for
infrastructure and urban construction over the past few years, one
third of which came from overseas sources.
</P>
<P>
The city has tried every possible means of attracting foreign
investment, but economic and technological development zones are
one of the favorites. The Guangzhou Economic Development Zone, for
example, has grown to a 20-billion-yuan annual output level and
provides 2.3 billion yuan in revenues.

<HEADLINE> China To Get Into Offshore Banking Business </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 12 (Xinhua) -- Starting this year, China will
launch off-shore banking business, Shanghai Securities News
reports today.
</P>
<P>
The new business was first tried out in the Shenzhen Special
Economic Zone, Guandong Province, in 1989 and was a significant
step forward in China's effort to improve its financial system,
prevent financial risks, and increase reforms, the newspaper says.
</P>
<P>
It quotes Mao Yingliang, the governor of the Shanghai Branch of
the People's Bank of China, the central bank, as saying that
Shanghai will begin its offshore banking business this
year. Shanghai's municipal government has decided to start it in
the Pudong New Area, a finance and trade zone separated from the
city proper by the Huangpu River.
</P>
<P>
It will try to make the most of Pudong's openness to form an
offshore financial market and speed up the process of turning
Shanghai into an international financial center.
</P>
<P>
After several years of experimentation, China has a fairly
complete set of administrative rules for the offshore financial
business, which includes foreign currency deposits and loans,
international settlements, foreign exchange guarantees, interbank
foreign currency borrowing and lending, and large deposit
transfers.
</P>
<P>
Experts say that Shanghai generally has all the right
conditions needed for the offshore financial business. It is
China's economic and financial center and has a concentration of
overseas financial institutions and is home to China's national
foreign exchange trading and one of its two stock exchanges.

SHENZHEN, February 12 (Xinhua) -- The city of Shenzhen,
nextdoor to Hong Kong on the north, expects to have 2.4 million
overseas tourists this year, an increase of 3.5 percent over last
year, according to Chi Xiongbiao, deputy director of the city's
Tourism Development Bureau.

<P>
The city can earn 967 million US dollars from those overseas
tourists, an annual rise of four percent, Chi says.

Last year, Shenzhen had eight million domestic and

million US dollars respectively, from them. It has become China's
fourth largest tourist city, after Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou.
</P>
<P>
Chi says the city's robust tourism growth is because of its
role as a lab for the country's reforms and opening to the outside
world.
</P>

He says that the city will add the stock market, industrial
exhibition hall, and some high-tech companies to the list of

<HEADLINE> 800 Women Apply to Join Sri Lankan Air Force </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, February 12 (Xinhua) -- About 800 women have applied
to join the Sri Lankan Air Force (SLAF) and fly over war-zones
since the SLAF began to recruit women pilots last November, chief
recruiting officer J. Ranasinghe said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
He said 33 candidates had already been selected and they will
be trained at the Air Force Flying Training School in
Anuradhapura, North Central Province, for two years.
</P>
<P>
Ranasinghe said they will receive the same training as the male
trainees.
</P>
<P>
Besides initial interviews the candidates had already gone
through, they will have to undergo an officer quality test, an
aptitude test, a medical test and a final interview, he said.
</P>
<P>
Once becoming pilots, they need to serve the Air Force for 12
years and will only be allowed to leave the service under the
directive of the president.
</P>
<P>
Depending on the vacancies, more women candidates could be
called in the future, Ranasinghe said.
</P>
<P>
The decision to recruit women pilots was made after the SLAF
failed to recruit enough male pilots to fill the vacancies left by
the loss of dozens of pilots in plane crashes.
</P>
<P>
The Air Force has lost at least 19 planes and helicopters,
including four warplanes and attack helicopters, in the past two
and a half years.
</P>
<P>
Until now, the SLAF has employed women only in ground roles,
mainly for office work.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia to Discontinue Advancing Foreign Debt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, February 12 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government has
decided to discontinue advancing its foreign debt payments and
will carefully weigh the pros and cons of a proposal to reschedule
the country's foreign debts, a senior official said.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a parliament hearing Wednesday, Finance Minister
Mar'ie Muhammad said Indonesia's foreign debt payments due in
fiscal 1998/99 were projected to total 37.8 trillion rupiah (5.18
billion U.S. dollar), excluding the amount of prepayments.
</P>
<P>
"Basically, the government always tries to service its foreign
debts on time. Therefore, we must carefully weigh the pros and
cons of any proposal to reschedule those debts. We have to
maintain our credibility internationally," local press reports
Thursday quoted the minister as saying.
</P>
<P>
He said the government's foreign debts as of December 31, 1997
totaled 63.5 billion dollars, of which 54.2 billion dollars were
direct government debts and 9.3 billion dollars state-owned
companies' debts.
</P>
<P>
According to the minister, all the foreign debts were free from
political strings, carried low interest rates and were generally
repayable over a minimum period of 10 years.
</P>
<P>
He said the government's foreign debts differed from the
private sector's in that they were long-term and carried lower
rates of interest.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia's private sector's foreign debts totaled 73.962
billion dollars at the end of December last year. Economists here
held that the private sector's debts were one of the main causes
for the depreciation of the Indonesian rupiah against the dollar.
</P>
<P>
The rupiah has lost more than 60 percent of its value against
the dollar since July last year.
</P>
<P>
Mar'ie admitted that to meet the needs of future investment,
the government would continue to require foreign loans but it was
determined to pursue a prudent foreign borrowing policy.
</P>
<P>
He also stressed that the future debts of the government and
state-owned companies would not be made for consumptive purposes
but for productive, high-value and export-oriented projects.

<HEADLINE> S.Korean Stock Prices Plunging Amid Possible Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, February 12 (Xinhua) -- The Seoul stock market dropped
about three percent and the won depreciated to 1,600 against the U.S.
dollar this morning amid a possibility of massive labor strike.
</P>
<P>
The composite index plumeted more than 20 points to below 500
points a few minutes after 10 a.m. Thursday, but recovered slightly to
506.50 as of 11 a.m., 13.64 points lower than Wednesday's close.
</P>
<P>
The composite index soared to over 550 points and the won
appreciated to 1,500 against the U.S. dollar at the end of last month
when South Korea reached an agreement with major creditor countries to
delay the payment of the nation's debts totaling 154 billion U.S.
dollars.
</P>
<P>
However, the stock market began to show a downward trend Monday
because the Korean Confederation of Trade Unions (KCTU), which formed
a new leadership after ousting their leaders responsible for signing
on Monday, threatened to stage a general strike to boycott a layoff
agreement reached by the representatives from labor, capital and the
government.
</P>
<P>
The representatives signed the agreement to legalize mass layoffs
in return for more labor freedom last Friday following hard
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, capital could dismiss workers only when they
face "emergency situation" as as financial trouble, merger or
acquisition.
</P>
<P>
The confederation Tuesday warned that a strike couldn't be avoided
unless the government went back to the negotiation table for another
round of talks to hammer out a new layoff accord.
</P>
<P>
But, the government Wednesday answered that there could not be any
form of renegotiation, saying that it could not tolerate illegal union
acts and would deal hard with strikes staged by labor unions.
</P>
<P>
The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has warned of a possible
recurrence of the foreign currency crisis if South Korean labor unions
walk out.
</P>
<P>
It said large-scale strikes in the course of corporate
restructuring will immediately hurt foreign sentiment for investments,
likely bringing a new round of financial crisis to the country, which
has been in a serious financial crisis caused by corporate failures
and bad loans of financial institutions since late 1997.
</P>
<P>
Under an agreement signed with the IMF last December for a rescue
loan of 57 billion U.S. dollars, South Korea has to restructure its
economy, open its financial market and legalize mass layoffs.
</P>
<P>
Analyst said at least one million South Koreans will lose their
jobs this year.

<HEADLINE> Italy Doubles Minimum Flight Altitude </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, February 11 (Xinhua) -- In the wake of the recent cable
car disaster, Italy has doubled the minimum altitude at which an
aircraft can fly over the national territory.
</P>
<P>
The new regulations come into effect immediately.
</P>
<P>
Italian Defense Minister Beniamino Andreatta, reporting to
parliament Wednesday, said he had given orders to double the
minimum threshold for low-flying flights.
</P>
<P>
This meant raising the lowest possible altitude from 500 to
1,000 feet (151 to 303 meters) over the Po plain and Appennines,
and from 500 to 2,000 feet (151 to 606 meters) throughout the
Italian alpine region. The lowest overflight altitudes for other
countries remains at 1,500 feet (454 meters).
</P>
<P>
The minister has also ordered a review of those areas correctly
set aside for the low-flight training with a view to environmental
impact and safety concerns.
</P>
<P>
Complaint forms have been made available to be used by citizens
or local officials to report hazards or violations of safety norms.
</P>
<P>
Andreatta once again emphasized: "The terrible incident would
not have happened if the rules had been correctly applied and if
the maps regularly supplied to NATO command posts by the Italian
Air Forces had been effectively distributed."
</P>
<P>
A low-flying United States warplane slashed ski-lift cables in
the Dolomites February 3, plunging 20 people in a cable car to
their deaths.
</P>
<P>
Formal contacts have been established with the pertinent office
at the U.S. embassy in Rome to expedite, as quickly as possible,
compensation to the families of the victims, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
The plane that brought the cable car down at the Mt. Cermis
resort was flying out of the Aviano base in northeastern Italy,
the biggest U.S. air base in Italy. It is about 90 miles (150
kilometers) southeast of the site of the accident in the Dolomite
range.

<HEADLINE> Jobless Thais May Receive Loan From Japan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, February 12 (Xinhua) -- Jobless people in Thailand
would receive aid from Japan which is considering providing them a
yen loan, the Thai Foreign Ministry said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
According to the ministry, discussions are at the initial
stage, while the amount of the loan will be roughly the same as
that Japan extended to Indonesia, which totaled 200 million yen
(1.6 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Japan is reported to be considering another 500 million yen (4
million dollars) to Indonesia to help relieve the plight of the
unemployed there.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese loan is seen as part of the Japanese government's
efforts to strengthen its regional role in political, economic and
security affairs.
</P>
<P>
But Thai Foreign Minsiter Surin Pitsuwan said he would like
Japan to treat Thailand as a partner rather than an aid recipient.

<HEADLINE> Presidential Election to Promote Unity: Armenian Leader </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, February 11 (Xinhua) -- The current presidential
campaign should promote national unity rather than deepen the
political crisis, Armenia's acting President Robert Kocharyan
noted Wednesday, according to the Interfax Agency.
</P>
<P>
Meeting representatives from the Black Sea Economic Cooperation
Organization (BSECO), Kocharyan added the presidential election
next month will be held in a "fair and understanding" atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
Kocharyan, also the prime minister, said Armenia's financial
market was not affected by the resignation of the president, adding
Armenia implemented all the investment plans with no capital
run-offs, he added.
</P>
<P>
Kocharyan became acting president after the National
Assembly of the Republic of Armenia accepted Ter-Petrosyan's
resignation on February 4.
</P>
<P>
Ter-Petrosyan, president since the country gained
independence after the former Soviet Union disintegrated in 1991,
decided to step down because of a public debate with Kocharyan
over policy toward the controversial Nagorno-Karabakh issue.
</P>
<P>
The presidential election is scheduled to be held on March 16.

<P>
SAN JOSE, February 11 (Xinhua) -- Vice ministers from 34
American countries held their second-day close-door meeting
Wednesday in an effort to reach agreement about negotiations for
establishing a free trade area for the Americas (ALCA).
</P>
<P>
According to sources, participants did not reach any agreement
on the first day about how negotiations are to be handled at ALCA,
its objectives and principles or its headquarters and the
establishment of a permanent secretariat.
</P>
<P>
The United States, Canada, Central America and the South
American Common Market (Mercosur) presented various ideas and
concepts for the ALCA structure.
</P>
<P>
Mercosur, which is composed of Brazil, Argentina, Paraguay and
Uruguay, proposed transforming the current 12 working groups into
five negotiating tables that would consist of services,
intellectual property and investment, solution of controversies,
trade disciplines, access to markets and an agrarian sector.
</P>
<P>
But the Central American countries proposed creating 11
negotiating tables.
</P>
<P>
Eduardo Ayala, vice-minister of foreign trade of Costa Rica and
chairman of this preparatory meeting, admitted that the topics of
the meeting are difficult, but all participants were aware that a
satisfactory outcome has to be reached.
</P>
<P>
A consensus document is expected to arise from the three-day
meeting. It will be approved during the March 16-18 meeting here
and presented to the second summit of the Americas on April 16-18
in Santiago, Chile.

<HEADLINE> Northern Chinese Province Builds Six Chemical Bases </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, February 12 (Xinhua) -- North China's Hebei
Province is building six chemical production bases over the next
two or three years, a local government official said.
</P>
<P>
Petrolchemical bases will be built in cities of Cangzhou
and Shijiazhuang. In the former, a city combining petrolchemical
production with salt chemical production is being built and the
latter will concentrate on chemical fiber and medicines.
</P>
<P>
Tangshan has been chosen for a salt chemical base that can
expand the existing soda production capacity to 1 million tons
 annually.
</P>
<P>
A coal-related chemical base in Handan will be geared to methyl
alcohol and acetic acid production.
</P>
<P>
The Baoding fine chemical base will develop sensitive film and
related products and a similar base will be built in Xinji for
barium and strontiam.
</P>
<P>
According to a provincial plan, Hebei will raise the ratio of
fine chemical products from the present 21.8 percent to 40 percent
by 2000, and chemical fertilizer output value will drop from 32
percent to no more than 25 percent.

<HEADLINE> Thailand to Waive VAT on Purchases by Tourists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, February 12 (Xinhua) -- Thailand is expected to waive
the 10 percent value-added-tax (VAT) on the goods that foreign
tourists buy in Thailand, a local newspaper said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Thai government is expected to issue an executive decree to
legalizing the waiver next month to encourage foreign tourists to
buy goods in Thailand, the Bangkok Post reported.
</P>
<P>
Deputy finance minister Pichet Phanvichartkul said Thailand
could lose 1.6 billion baht (40 million U.S. dollars) in tax
revenues a year after the waiver takes effect, but the move could
help generate tens of billions of baht from tourism, sales of
goods and employment each year.
</P>
<P>
The Thai Finance Ministry is working on the draft decree which
will be presented to the cabinet for approval late next month.
</P>
<P>
Thailand is pushing ahead the tax waiver plan in a bid to make
the country as a shopping center to catch up with Singapore and
Hong Kong, bringing in more foreign exchanges it badly needs.

<HEADLINE> Italy: Military Actions Against Iraq Option </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, February 11 (Xinhua) -- Military measures against Iraq
are an option if Saddam Hussein keeps refusing access to alleged
weapons sites, Italian Prime Minister Romano Prodi said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on Italian state radio, Prodi said if the appeal for a
diplomatic solution went unheeded, "non-peaceful weapons remain,
unfortunately."
</P>
<P>
If the United Nations inspections were not "absolutely
transparent", Prodi warned, "it is clear that the conflict cannot
be averted."
</P>
<P>
He said the appeal made with visiting Russian President Boris
Yeltsin on Tuesday lays down a set of precise conditions for
Saddam to respect.
</P>
<P>
The appeal stresses a preference for political rather than
military responses to the stand-off over weapons inspections.
But, Prodi said, "it is accompanied by conditions that absolutely
cannot be avoided."
</P>
<P>
Asked if Italy had informed its traditional allies before
taking the unusual step of making the appeal with Russia, the
Italian prime minister said this initiative was agreed in a
specific way only with Yeltsin, but the allies were informed of it.
</P>
<P>
He admitted that he did not consult United States President
Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
Prodi stressed that the issue of weapons inspections lay at the
heart of the appeal. Italy and Russia would continue to make
every effort to avert military conflict while working to ensure
all weapons sites were inspected thoroughly.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Italian Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini said
Wednesday that there was no reason to deny the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization and U.S. the use military bases in Italy as a
contribution to a negotiated solution to the crisis between Iraq
and the U.N.
</P>
<P>
If the bases were unavailable it would help undermine the
credibility of continuing diplomatic efforts to open up suspected
Iraqi sites to the U.N. monitoring teams, Dini said.

<HEADLINE> Ukrainian Government Urged to Clear Arrears </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, February 11 (Xinhua) -- In a resolution adopted on
Wednesday, the Ukrainian parliament urged the government to clear
all the arrears of salaries and pensions totalling more than five
billion gryvnas (about 263 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The parliament demanded that the government work out a time
schedule on the payment and report to it by May 1.
</P>
<P>
It also suggested that officials responsible for the arrears
should be held prosecutable.
</P>
<P>
Answering to the parliament on Wednesday, Finance Minister Igor
Michukov said the government planned to earmark 1.3 billion gryvnas
(about 68.4 million dollars) in this year's budget for clearing
the arrears created by a government's abstinence policy in the past
few years.
</P>
<P>
In order to get loans from the World Bank and the International
Monetary Fund, the Ukrainian government imposed a strict control over the
issuance of bank notes and budget deficit, thus leading to a severe
shortage in funds for salary and pension payment.

<HEADLINE> Animal Pictures Help People Find Lost Properties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, February 12 (Xinhua) -- Southwest China's Yunnan
province is famous for its variety of animal species. In its
capital Kunming, animal pictures are helping people retrieve their
properties lost on taxis.
</P>
<P>
The pictures of cute elephants, lions, eagles and others
coupled with a single- or a two-digit number adorn the insides of
all the taxis in the city known as the Spring City. Apart from the
picture, there is a message in both Chinese and English, "The
police suggests that you remember the animal and the number".
</P>
<P>
When a lady came to Kunming for a shopping tour, she left her
purse with 20,000 yuan (about 2,400 US dollars) inside on the
taxi. Fortunately, her intrigued son was able to tell the police
the lion and the corresponding number 78.
</P>
<P>
In two minutes, the police traced the taxi and the 20,000 yuan
soon finds its way back to her, who was overwhelmed with relief
and gratitude.
</P>
<P>
There are nearly 6,000 cabs in Kunming, said Zhang Jun, deputy
police chief of the city. The pictures of 37 commonly known
animals, including elephants, snakes and eagles, are used to mark
the cabs, coupled with numbers from one to 99.
</P>
<P>
Each animal with one number represents two cabs in different
types, explained Zhang, therefore one animal with numbers from 1
to 99 are able to represent 198 taxis, and 37 animals with 99
numbers represent 7,326.
</P>
<P>
For example, if one wants to find a cab with the picture of a
frog and the number 37, a computer operator in the police station
can instantly find out that a frog with 37 represent a Santana and
a Charade, two totally different sedans. Other information shown
on the computer includes their respective plate numbers, colors,
owners, as well as the pictures, ages and addresses of their
drivers.
</P>
<P>
"This differentiation of cabs by animals, which can only be in
Kunming, has greatly convenienced passengers," said Zhang. "People
tend to take little notice of the plate number of the cab they
take, let alone remember it. However, an animal picture with a
single- or two-digit number is interesting to look at and easy to
memorize."
</P>
<P>
Police figures show that the retrieval rate of lost properties
on taxis used to be less than 10 percent, which was about the
national average. Since the animal pictures were introduced last
August, the rate has soared to 43.8 percent.

Committee (IOC) is will to cooperate with an investigation by Japanese
police of Canadian snowboarder Ross Rebagliati, who was disqualified
from the games after testing positive for marijuana, an IOC
spokesperson said here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"I can see no reason whyIOC would not cooperate with the local
authorities," Michele Verdier said at a joint IOC-NAOC press briefing.
</P>
<P>
Verdier said she did not know if the IOC had already been asked for
help in investigating Rebagliati who was stripped of his giant slalom
gold medal Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Rebagliati faces criminal charges if found in possession of
marijuana in Japan.
</P>
<P>
Possession of drugs is illegal in Japan. One police spokesman
said:"We would not give penalty to anyone who takes drugs. But if he
takes it, he must possess it."
</P>
<P>
It was the first drug case that hit the games.
</P>
<P>
IOC Director-General Francois Carrard, who made the announcement
at a press conference on Wednesday, said Canada was appealing against
the decision to disqualify Rebagliati.
</P>
<P>
He said a ruling would be made within 24 hours on the appeal.
</P>
<P>
Marijuana is commonly used as a recreational drug rather than
performance-enhancing substance, but the International Olympic
Committee listed it in the banned substances.
</P>
<P>
Carrard said that metabolized marijuana was detected in an "A"
sample, and then a "B" sample confirmed 17.8 nanograms per milliliter
of the substance.
</P>
<P>
The IOC has no minimum amounts set for substance infractions, but
the International Ski Federation to which Rebagliati is a member sets
15 nanogram limit.
</P>
<P>
Deciding between issuing a warning or sanctions to the snowboarder,
both the medical commission and the IOC Executive Board voted in
favour of sanctions.
</P>
<P>
The medical commission voted 13-12 to recommend sanctioning the
snowboarder to the IOC which takes the action. The IOC executive
board voted 3-2 with 2 abstentions on the matter, Carrard said.
</P>
<P>
Italy's Thomas Prugger won the silver medal behind Rebagliati on
Sunday, with Ueli Kestenholz of Switzerland taking bronze and Austrian
Dieter Krassnig finishing fourth. They would move up if the
disqualification is upheld.

Chapman praised the privatizing process undertaken by the

<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, February 11 (Xinhua) - A hijacked Bulgarian ship is
sailing for the Somali port of Bosasso where the hijackers will
get off, Bulgarian Foreign Ministry Spokesman's Office said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Belize-flagged Alfa BG with 11 crew on board was hijacked
by uncontrolled Somali military units on January 13. It was being
towed by a Syrian vessel in Somali waters after having an engine
failure.
</P>
<P>
The pirates demanded 600,000 U.S. dollars for the release of
the two ships' crews. The Syrian Haramem company, which acted as
intermediary in the negotiations with the pirates, managed to
slash their demands to 130,000 dollars.
</P>
<P>
The ransom was remitted to an account with a Somali bank, but
the passing of the money through several intermediaries delayed
the release of the sailors.
</P>
<P>
The ship is expected to arrive in Bosasso around midnight
Bulgarian local time where the hijackers will disembark, the
Bulgarian Embassy in the Ethiopian capital of Addis Ababa said.
</P>
<P>
The ship will then leave for the Yemeni port of Aden.
</P>
<P>
The sailors are in good health and are happy that the incident
has ended, the captain of Alfa BG said in a message conveyed via a
passing Bulgarian ship.

<P>
BELGRADE, February 11 (Xinhua) -- Boro Bosich, co-prime
minister of the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina, Wednesday
protested the arrest of a Serb war crime suspect by the
Muslim-Croat secret police in Sarajevo.
</P>
<P>
Bosich, a Serb, in letters to senior members of international
organizations, called for Goran Vasich's release. Vasich had been
arrested on February 6 on charge of killing Haklja Turajlich,
former deputy prime minister of Bosnia-Herzegovina.
</P>
<P>
The assassination took place in 1993 at a Serb check point when
a Serb soldier opened fire at Turajlich who was on his way to
war-torn Sarajevo under escort of French peacekeepers. Turajlich
died instantly on the spot.
</P>
<P>
Following the arrest of Vasich, U.N. spokesman Aleksandar
Ivanko told reporters in Sarajevo that Vasich might be sent to the
international tribunal in The Hague for trial.
</P>
<P>
However, the Interior Ministry of the Serb Republic issued a
statement Tuesday, terming the arrest as a grave incident which
would cause panic among the Serbs and block the free movement of
people.

WARSAW, February 11 (Xinhua) -- The Polish Government said on
Wednesday that Poland is prepared to deploy appropriate supportive
troops to the Persian Gulf region if necessary.
</P>
<P>
An official statement issued by the government said the Polish
government has been following the situation in the gulf closely
since the beginning of the crisis arising out of the United
Nations weapons inspections in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Although the Polish government supports the efforts made by the
United States and other countries for a peaceful solution, it
realizes that the use of force will be realistic if all these
efforts are in vain, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
But it noted that the use of force was a last resort, and could
be justified only after the exhaustion of all political solutions
to persuade Iraq to comply with relevant resolutions adopted by
the United Nations Security Council.
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports said that in response to a United States
request for Polish support, the Polish government had decided to
send antichemical warfare troops, a platoon or battalion strong,
to the Gulf if necessary.

<HEADLINE> Police Questions Canadian Snowboarder over Drug-Taking </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAGANO, Japan, February 12 (Xinhua) -- Japanese police will
question Canadian snowboarder Ross Rebagliati, who was stripped of the
Winter Olympic gold medal after testing positive for marijuana, on
suspicion of violating Japan's drug control law, local news reports
said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Under Japan's rigid drug control law, possession of the marijuana
carries up to five years imprisonment.
</P>
<P>
Reports said the International Olympic Committee (IOC) will be
asked to cooperate in the investigation.
</P>
<P>
Police suspect Rebagliati may have used the drug after coming to
Japan because the IOC reportedly found traces of a substance in
marijuana that oly responds to tests for a short period of time.
</P>
<P>
IOC, however, is not obliged to report to local police when drugs
that violate domestic laws are found in doping tests, reports said.
</P>
<P>
Rebaliati will not face criminal charges unless he is found in
possession of marijuana, even if he consumed it in Japan.
</P>
<P>
The Canadian snowboarder, who won the men's snowboarding men's
giant slalom at the current Winter Olympics last Sunday, told Canadian
Olympic officials he had not used marjuana since April last year.

<P>
ISLAMABAD, February 11 (Xinhua) -- Inclement weather was
hampering relief operations of the United Nations and other
international aid agencies in the quake-stricken Takhor Province
in Northern Afghanistan, U.N. officials said here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"There is about 20 centimeter snow there and no relief plane
could get into northern Afghanistan," said a U.N. official here on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Some reports said a relief helicopter from Tajikistan could
only land in the snow-clad Takhor, where more than 4,000 were
killed and many injured in last week's powerful earthquake and
strong aftershocks.
</P>
<P>
A Pakistan Air Force C-130 plane Monday carried badly needed
blankets and medicine for the quake-affected people.
</P>
<P>
Rupert Colville, the U.N. spokesman in Islamabad, said
Wednesday that a five-truck convoy laden with some 50 tons of
wheat was stuck up and could not reach the quake-hit region due to
heavy snow.
</P>
<P>
"There are really catastrophic weather conditions there and we
are trying to send at least desperately needed plastic sheets for
the shelterless people," he added.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. official said some five to six relief aircraft would
be flying to Takhor Thursday provided the weather situation
improves there.
</P>
<P>
He said the initial death toll of about 4,000 seemed accurate
as the devastating quake caused widespread damage in the remote
region bordering Tajikistan.

<HEADLINE> El Nino Contributes to Grain Shortage in Colombia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTA FE DE BOGOTA, February 11 (Xinhua) -- Colombian grain
growers are forecasting a possible shortage in grain production in
the country due to the meteorological phenomenon of "El Nino,"
National Federation of Traders (Fenalco) said here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
This situation could force traders to import at least 3 million
tons of grains from countries such as the United States, Canada,
Argentina and South Africa. The products that may be in short
supply for this year include corn, sorghum, wheat and barley.
</P>
<P>
According to figures from Fenalco, El Nino caused a reduction
of production in crop-growing land areas in 1997. Arable land was
reduced to 772,186 hectares, which was 6 percent less than that of
1996 and 35 percent less than in 1990.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, grain production fell last year to 1.53
million tons, a decline of 10 percent from 1996 and 29 percent
from 1990.

<HEADLINE> Bosnian Serbs Removed "Sarajevo Wall" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZAGREB, February 11 (Xinhua) -- Bosnian Serbs on Wednesday
afternoon removed a wall they began erecting between the Federal
Croat-Muslim and Serb part of Sarajevo on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Reports of Croatian News Agency from Sarajevo said the wall was
removed after representatives of international organizations in
Bosnia-Herzegovina said freedom of movement must be ensured
throughout the country, including along the inter-entity
separation line in Sarajevo.
</P>
<P>
About 200 Bosnian Serbs started building the wall in the
district of Dobrinja in protest against the arrest of Goran Vasic,
suspected of killing Bosnian vice-Premier Hakija Turajlic in 1993.
</P>
<P>
The circumstances surrounding Vasic's arrest are being
investigated by the International Police Task Force, due to
suspicions that he had not been arrested by Sarajevo police but by
members of an unauthorized secret Bosniak (Muslim) service.
</P>
<P>
Dragan Savic, who organized the building
of the wall, said the wall was removed in "understanding towards the
international community which is trying to solve the issue of
Vasic's arrest."
</P>
<P>
Savic threated that they would build "a real wall" and
protest throughout the Bosnian Serb entity if Sarajevo police
failed to surrender Vasic to the Bosnian Serb entity.
</P>
<P>
The Bosnian Serbs who gathered in Dobrinja were visited by the
head of the UN mission in Bosnia, Elizabbeth Rehn.
</P>
<P>
The report said, according to the spokeswoman of the
international High Representatives office, Aisling Burne, the
High Representative is disappointed that Bosnian Serbs act
this way when progress has been made in the peace process.
</P>
<P>
UN spokesman in Sarajevo Aleksandar Ivanko said the Bosnian
Serb police were requested to ensure the removal of the wall and
undisturbed crossing of the inter-entity separation line.

<HEADLINE> Table Tennis Star Thrown out of National Team </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 12 (Xinhua) -- Table tennis star Yang Ying,
member of China's world women's championship team, has been thrown
out of the national squad for missing the roll call at the
training camp in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Yang, from southeast China's Jiangsu province, has been sent to
the provincial team as a punishment of her indiscipline, said head
coach Cai Zhenhua.
</P>
<P>
The 19-year-old Yang, who plays a fast-attacking game in the
penhold style, helped China win the team title at the world
championships in Manchester, England, last May. She also snatched
the doubles crown with world No.1 Deng Yaping.
</P>
<P>
All Chinese national team players were demanded to return to
the Beijing camp by 19:00 of February 1 after the Lunar New Year
holiday which started on January 28. Yang was three hours late
for the roll call, said Cai.
</P>
<P>
"She is complacent after the world championships," said Cai. "I
have to be fair. Everyone must return to the camp by the exact
time I demand."
</P>
<P>
The Chinese coach said Yang could make her way back to the
national team.
</P>
<P>
"If she works hard and disciplines herself, we may call her
back," Cai said.
</P>
<P>
Yang, who had complained Cai was just too tough on her, said on
Wednesday that she felt remorseful and would shape up.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Coal Mines Develop Farming On Wasteland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HEFEI, February 12 (Xinhua) -- The city of Huaibei, a coal
producer in east China's Anhui Province, has found a good way to
bring some of its vast rundown areas back to life, by developing
farming.
</P>
<P>
A large amount of land that used to produce 19 million tons of
coal annually was abandoned when it was mined out and sank and
became marshland or a refuse dump.
</P>
<P>
There are some 11,666 ha. of this wasteland in Huaibei on more
than 10 percent of the city's cultivable land, leaving 220,000
local farmers without land to till.
</P>
<P>
To solve this problem, the local government has come up with
different means of developing environment-friendly farming by
raising fresh-water fish, poultry, livestock, and fruits and
vegetables.
</P>
<P>
The Huaibei Power Plant is also using coal-ash as landfill and
has planted 213 ha. of trees.

<HEADLINE> China Has Too Many Theme Parks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 12 (Xinhua) -- Some Chinese are saying that
the country has too many theme parks and should think twice before
starting construction work on any new ones.
</P>
<P>
The construction boom started in the 1980s, when the theme park
was introduced to China, according to "China Economic Times".
</P>
<P>
In the early 1990s, the large city of Shanghai was worrying
about the absence of theme parks, but now, almost each suburban
county boasts several such attractions.
</P>
<P>
There are also several in surrounding cities like Wuxi and
Suzhou. Along the 150-kilometer railway line from Shanghai to
Wuxi, there are some 20 theme parks.
</P>
<P>
Song Dynasty City in scenic Hangzhou turned out to be a good
business with about three million visitors annually, but the eight
more theme parks planned for the city are thought by some experts
to be too much.
</P>
<P>
Because of the excessive number, business at some of Shanghai's
theme parks is sluggish and some have even gone bankrupt.
</P>
<P>
The high price of tickets, which ranges from 40 yuan (about 5
US dollars) to 100 yuan (about 13 US dollars), also scares some
visitors away.

<HEADLINE> China's Non-State Sector Gains Share in National Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 12 (Xinhua) -- China's non-state-owned sector
has increased its ratio in the national economy as the country
steps up its economic restructuring.
</P>
<P>
Individually-run and private enterprises turned to the state
coffer 44.1 billion yuan in taxes between January and October last
year, up 23 percent from the same 1996 period, according to the
State Administration of Taxation (SAT).
</P>
<P>
Taxes collected from overseas-funded enterprises soared 32
percent to 77.8 billion yuan during that period, while those from
collectively-run enterprises rose three percent to 100.1 billion
yuan.
</P>
<P>
The figures indicate that the non-state sector has become a
major driving force behind the growth of China's fiscal revenues,
the SAT said.
</P>
<P>
Statistics released by the State Administration for Industry
and Commerce show that at the end of last year, China had more
than 28 million individually-run industrial and commercial
businesses employing a total of 55 million people.
</P>
<P>
The country also had over 800,000 private enterprises with a
total work force of more than six million.
</P>
<P>
Employees of the individually-run and private businesses
include workers, farmers, intellectuals, resigned officials and
retirees.
</P>
<P>
As China quickens the pace of the restructuring of its state
enterprises, millions of workers are displaced each year, while the
overall work force increases at an annual rate of nearly 10
million people.
</P>
<P>
Over the past few years, the non-state-owned sector has become
a major source for employing the displaced workers and new
job seekers. Last year alone individually-run businesses and
private enterprises employed more than 900,000 displaced workers
nationwide, with another 1.9 million laid-off workers applying to
run businesses or enterprises of their own.

<HEADLINE> Romanian President Stresses Need for Stability </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, February 11 (Xinhua) -- Romanian President Emil
Constantinescu said Wednesday that stability is the top
priority of the country.
</P>
<P>
He appealed to all political parties and forces to support the
new government to "build" rather than "destroy" the country.
</P>
<P>
Constantinescu made the remarks at the inauguration of five new
ministers which marked the end of a two-week political crisis.
</P>
<P>
The crisis was triggered on January 29 when the Democratic
Party decided to withdraw from the seven-party coalition
government led by Prime Minister Victor Ciorbea because of its
differences with the largest ruling party, the National Peasants'
Party.
</P>
<P>
The two sides later agreed to continue their cooperation and
Prime Minister Ciorbea nominated five new ministers to take over
the vacancies in his government following the withdrawal of the
Democratic Party which now supports the government conditionally.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to members of the reshuffled cabinet, Constantinescu
said that politicians and businessmen around the world are
following closely the situation. Romania has witnessed two major
government reshuffles since December last year.
</P>
<P>
"Disturbance is beneficial to nobody," the president said. The
country needs a clear political prospect so that the government
could take resolute measures to deal with problems facing the
country according to the wishes of the people.

<HEADLINE> New Grain Production Center In Northern Chinese Pastoral Area </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HOHHOT, February 12 (Xinhua) -- The Hulun Buir League
(prefecture) in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region has become a
new grain production center, with its annual grain output
increasing 19 percent annually to 1.6 billion kg last year.
</P>
<P>
Wheat, bean, and rape seed output has gone from 1.5 billion kg
in 1996 to last year's two billion kg. The bean production base in
southern Hulun Buir provides 70 percent of Inner Mongolia's beans
with 19 percent of its land.
</P>
<P>
This has meant the league is self-sufficient in grain supply
and can even sell its surplus grain to other parts of the
country. A local agriculture official says that this is because of
greater use of capital in the past few years.
</P>
<P>
Farmers have reclaimed 266,600 ha of wasteland, and improved
200,000 ha of low-yield land and dug 1,400 km of irrigation
ditches. As a result, it has 1.3 million ha of cultivated land.
</P>
<P>
The league has used 40 million yuan from abroad to build
cooking oil refineries, flour mills, and farms.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Enjoy Religious Freedom, Says Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, February 11 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese Constitution
provides religious freedom to citizens and some Westerners
accusing China of "religious persecution" do not understand the
reality in China, a high-ranking official said here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
There are over 100 million religious believers in China, and
the church there has printed over 20 million copies of Bible for
them, said Ye Xiaowen, visiting Director of the Religious Affairs
Bureau under the State Council of China.
</P>
<P>
He told a press conference that he knew from a friend that at a
recent Washington D.C. seminar on "Religious Persecution in China",
nor speakers or participants were aware of the figures.
</P>
<P>
Besides, he said, nobody knew that there were only 700,000
Protestant believers in China before 1949 when the People's
Republic of China was founded.
</P>
<P>
That was what happened within 150 years since the first
introduction of Protestantism into China, he added.
</P>
<P>
In contrast, he said, the number of protestant believers in
China has grown to over 10 million in the past four decades.
</P>
<P>
Ye and two Chinese religious leaders arrived in the United
States on January 29 for a visit at the invitation of U.S.
distinguished religious figure Billy Graham and Chairman of East
Gates International Rev. Nelson Graham.
</P>
<P>
The trip has taken them to Seattle, Chicago and Washington with
the last stop at New York to end on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Ye said from his contacts with U.S.church leaders and
congressmen, he strongly feel that most Americans hope to have
good understanding of China and want to see growing friendship
between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
"That is the main stream which is irresistible," he said.

<HEADLINE> (Updated) Clinton Asks Senate to Approve NATO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 11 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
Wednesday asked the Senate to approve the accords that will bring
Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic into the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization (NATO).
</P>
<P>
A ceremony, at which Clinton transmitted to the Senate the
protocols of ratification on admitting the new members, was held
at the State Department, opening the president's campaign to
enlarge the 16-nation alliance.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the ceremony, Clinton reiterated that the expansion
will make the alliance stronger, Europe more stable and undivided.
</P>
<P>
"These three states will add some 200,000 troops to the
alliance," the president said.
</P>
<P>
"A larger NATO will be a better deterrent against aggressors of
the future. It will deepen the ranks of those who stand with us
should deterrents fail," Clinton added.
</P>
<P>
The ceremony was attended by Vice President Al Gore, Secretary
of State Madeleine Albright, Senator Joseph R. Biden, Senator
William Roth and the foreign ministers of Poland, Hungary and the
Czech Republic.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the ceremony, Albright said, "Ultimately, we are
building a larger NATO because America has a vital interest in the
security of Europe, one that has always extended to the central
and eastern parts of that continent."
</P>
<P>
"We are doing this because NATO is the key to protecting that
interest. It's our sword and our shield, the greatest war
deterrent in history, the most powerful, credible, effective
instrument we have for joint action with nations that share our
values," she added.
</P>
<P>
Biden echoed with the same views. "NATO is the cornerstone of
American leadership and the foundation for security throughout the
transatlantic community."
</P>
<P>
"I firmly believe that NATO provides the best architecture on
which we can build a united Europe, a Europe that is a vibrant and
active partner of the United States," he added.
</P>
<P>
"Above all, the accession of the Czech Republic, Hungary and
Poland will be a historic step in the construction of an inclusive
security system where peace and stability are the defining
features of post-Cold War years," affirmed the senator.
</P>
<P>
Leaders of the 16-member alliance decided to accept Poland,
Hungary and the Czech Republic as new members by 1999. But the
decision needs to be ratified by legislation of the members.
</P>
<P>
The plan has been so far ratified by Canada and Denmark. The
U.S. Senate is scheduled to vote in March on the move, which is
strongly opposed by Russia.

WASHINGTON, February 11 (Xinhua) -- Hillary Rodham Clinton on
Wednesday said her husband has "taken the right position" in not
discussing in detail allegations he had an affair with a former
intern.
</P>
<P>
"I don't anticipate that this will evaporate. But I anticipate
it will slowly dissipate under the weight of their own
insubstantiality," Mrs.Clinton told a group of reporters she
invited to the White House.
</P>
<P>
She said Americans are "smart, fair-minded and savvy" when it
comes to sizing up headlines about the White House sex scandal.
She said her husband's approval ratings are high because Americans
are satisfied with the job he has been doing.
</P>
<P>
She said the people "see the way things are and they are
drawing their own conclusions." She added the president's optimism
"has sent a signal to the American people about what is
important."

<HEADLINE> Chinese UN Ambassador Briefs on China's Social Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, February 11 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese Government
has always attached great importance to coupling economic growth
with all-round social development, so as to ensure social
stability and harmony, Qin Huasun, Chinese Ambassador to the
United Nations said here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the 36th session of the Commission for Social
Development of the United Nations, Qin Huasun said since the
policy of reform and opening up was introduced in 1978, the
Chinese Government, by taking a series of measures to eliminate
poverty, has lifted 200 million Chinese out of poverty and thus
provided them with necessary material conditions to better enjoy
the various rights entitled to them.
</P>
<P>
Qin said, to solve the problem of the workers laid off during
the economic reconstructuring process, many cities have managed to
set up "re-employment fund", carry out "re-employment programs",
and give re-employment training to laid-off workers.
</P>
<P>
Qin said the Chinese people enjoy the rights to participate in
social life. It is stipulated by the Constitution of the People's
Republic of China that all power of the People's Republic of China
belongs to the people. The People exercise their right to
participate in the discussion and running of state affairs through
the democratically-elected National People's congress and local
people's congress at various levels.
</P>
<P>
Ambassador Qin said China is a country composed of people from
many ethnic groups. Therefore, ethnic unity holds the key to
social stability and social development. The Chinese Government
has instituted a system of regional autonomy in ethnic minority
areas, which respects the customs and traditions of minority
ethnic groups and opposes the discrimination and oppression of
them. On the other hand, the Chinese Government has also made
untiring efforts to help develop the economy of minority areas so
as to achieve common progress.
</P>
<P>
The Ambassador said the Chinese Government also pays much
attention to the life and development of such vulnerable groups as
the young, the elderly and the disabled by formulating policies
and regulations to ensure that those groups enjoy the equal right
to be integrated in social life and share the material and
cultural achievement of the society.

<HEADLINE> US Civic, Religious Leaders Oppose Attack on Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 11 (Xinhua) -- U.S. religious groups and
civic organizations Wednesday rallied in front of the White House,
demonstrating their will to oppose bombing Iraq by the United
States.
</P>
<P>
Gordaon Clark, the executive director of the Peace Action,
which sponsored the rally, said at the gathering that the U.S.
policy toward Iraq was "politically inept, strategically perilous
and morally bankrupt."
</P>
<P>
"The U.S. is blundering headlong into one of the greatest
geopolitical quagmires of this century, with virtually no thought
whatsoever to the myriad of potentially disastrous consequences
which could follow," Clark said, who leads the Peace Action, the
largest grassroots peace organization in the United States.
</P>
<P>
He said bombing could only kill thousands of innocent people,
men, women and children while nothing could be solved as the
Clinton administration expects.
</P>
<P>
He called for sustained diplomacy instead of military action,
saying, "While bombing Iraq may be the easy answer to diverting
public attention from the current domestic news, there is no quick
or `easy' solution to the problems in Iraq. Only sustained
diplomacy can address the issues."
</P>
<P>
The United States has already assembled a mighty force
including warplanes and warships in the Gulf for a preparation of
an air strike on Iraq. And more warplanes are expected to depart
Thursday for the region.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Marine Corps General Anthony Zinni, the commander of the
U.S. force in the Middle East, said Wednesday that the U.S. force
there would be ready to strike Iraq within about a week or so.
</P>
<P>
At the rally, the American Muslim Council, a religious group,
released a statement, urging President Bill Clinton to take "all
necessary and appropriate action," but not military action, to
deal with the current Iraqi crisis over weapons inspections.
</P>
<P>
"Military strike against the nation of Iraq would be an unjust
and unwise course of action and would comprise the third part of a
triple victimization of the Iraqi people," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The American Muslim Council called on "the Muslim world and
American Muslims to play their Islamic role" in stopping a
possible attack on Iraqi people.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Wolf Fassett, the general secretary of the General Board of
Church and Society of the United Methodist Church, also called on
President Clinton "to end all preparations for war and to use
diplomatic means and other necessary resources to find a
nonviolent solution" that would halt the suffering and death of
Iraqi people.

WASHINGTON, February 11 (Xinhua) -- Nineteen U.S. warplanes
will leave their bases in the United States for the Gulf Thursday
and Friday to join a U.S. military force already stationed there,
prepared to stage a fierce air strike on Iraq, defense officials
said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The planes, ordered to the region by Defense Secretary William
Cohen, will arrive at bases in the region by the weekend, the

</P>
<P>
Six F-16 fighter jets will take off from Shaw Air Force Base in
South Carolina early Thursday and are expected to go to Bahrain.
Later Thursday, six B-52 bombers will leave Barksdale Air Force
base in Louisiana and a B-1 bomber will take off from Ellsworth
Air Force base, South Dakota.
</P>
<P>
Early Friday, six radar-evading F-117A stealth fighters will
depart Holloman Air Force base, New Mexico, for the Gulf.
</P>
<P>
The B-52 bombers are expected to join eight other B-52s now at
a British air base on the Indian Ocean island of Diego Garcia.
</P>
<P>
The stealth fighters are expected to join six other F-117As now
in Kuwait, and the B-1 bomber is expected to go to Bahrain, where
two U.S. B-1s are already stationed.
</P>
<P>
Twenty-three tankers and other support planes will also be sent
to the region. And the total of the aircraft then will reach more
than 350 in the area.
</P>
<P>
The additional warplanes were requested by Marine Corps General
Anthony Zinni. He said Wednesday that the U.S. force would be

<HEADLINE> U.S. Nationwide Home Prices Rise Strongly in 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 11 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. nationwide typical
home prices grew more than three times faster than that of the
inflation rate, the National Association of Realtors reported here
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Southern and Midwestern cities dominated the list of cities
with the biggest increases in home prices in 1997, according to
the association.
</P>
<P>
The largest increases for existing homes, from the fourth
quarter of 1996 to the fourth quarter of 1997, was registered in
Charleston of South Carolina where it's median home price jumped
16.7 percent to 110,500 U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
It was followed by Des Moines, up 15.5 percent; San Francisco,
14.1 percent; Fort Myers, sla., 13.5 percent, and Lexington, Ky.,
11.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
Nationally, the median price rose 6.2 percent to 124,800
dollars. It was nearly double the 3.3 percent rise a year earlier,
the biggest fourth quarter-to-fourth quarter gain in six years.
The growth clearly surpassed overall inflation, which was just 1.7
percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
By region, prices last year rose 7.4 percent in the West, 7
percent in the Midwest, 6.9 percent in the South and 4.6 percent
in the Northeast.
</P>
<P>
Only 10 cities of the 134 on the Realtors' list showed fourth
quarter-to-fourth quarter price drops which include Honolulu, down
10 percent to a median of 300,000 dollars, led the list, followed
by Richland, Washington, down 7.1 percent, and Trenton, New
Jersey, down 3.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
Nationally, price gains were supported by a record 4.73 million
sales of existing single-family homes and co-ops in 1997. Those in
turn were boosted by low mortgage rates and strong employment
incomes.

<HEADLINE> Turkey on Iraq Crisis: Not to Take Risks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, February 11 (Xinhua) -- Referring to Turkey's
speculated role in a possible U.S. attack against Iraq, Prime
Minister Mesut Yilmaz said Wednesday that no one should expect
Turkey to throw itself in the middle of everything and "take
risks."
</P>
<P>
Speaking to a parliamentary group of his Motherland Party
(ANAP), Yilmaz said that the current crisis between the United
States and Iraq over arms inspection would severely affect Turkey.
</P>
<P>
He said "No one should expect Turkey to take risks without
negotiating with all related foreign parties, and moreover,
especially when there is nothing being demanded from us."
</P>
<P>
There has been a wide speculation if Turkey, a U.S. ally in the
region, would allow U.S. warplanes to take off from its territory
to launch possible air strikes against Iraq. Ankara did so to the
allied forces during the 1991 Gulf war.
</P>
<P>
Yilmaz said if the U.S. forces ask for military support from
Turkey this time, the decision would only be made by the Turkish
parliament.
</P>
<P>
"The policy of our government is solely formulated with
Turkey's interests in mind. We have done all we can in looking for
a peaceful solution... Our armed forces are taking every
precaution required against all odds," the Turkish prime minister
added
</P>
<P>
"From now on, we want Iraq to comply with the U.N. resolutions
and the U.N. to take steps toward fully lifting the sanctions
imposed on Iraq," the prime minister said.
</P>
<P>
Referring to a possible U.S. military strike against Iraq,
Turkish Deputy Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit told members of his
Democratic Left Party Wednesday that "It is of course worrying us,
if that is true. This would mean a superpower like the United
States is entering a war without predicting its consequences."
</P>
<P>
Ecevit also called on the U.S. administration to hold more
dialogs with Turkey while formulating its policies on Iraq since
Turkey is concerned about its southern neighbor.

<HEADLINE> Bulgaria Wants to Join NATO in Second Wave </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 11 (Xinhua) -- Bulgaria seeks to join the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) in a second wave of the
alliance's expansion, and is rapidly upgrading its armed forces,
said Bulgarian President Petar Stoyanov Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
A NATO membership would make relations between Bulgaria and
Russia "more stable and less ambiguous," the visiting leader told
reporters at the National Press Club.
</P>
<P>
Stoyanov said Greece and Turkey backed Bulgaria's candidacy to
join NATO and improving relations between these traditional rivals
was one of his diplomatic priorities.
</P>
<P>
Stoyanov, who started his visit to the U.S. last Thursday,
discussed NATO membership and other issues with President Bill
Clinton at a meeting Tuesday that included Vice President Al Gore
and Secretary of State Madeleine Albright.
</P>
<P>
He also met separately with Attorney General Janet Reno to talk
about his government's efforts to crack down on the manufacture of
pirated compact discs.
</P>
<P>
"My country's strategic choice of membership in the European
Union and NATO is no hostile act vis-a-vis Russia," Stoyanov wrote
in an article published on Tuesday's edition of The Washington
Post.
</P>
<P>
"It corresponds fully with our determination to develop our
relations with that vast state on the basis of mutual benefit and
respect of our sovereignty and national dignity," he added.
</P>
<P>
NATO leaders agreed last July that Poland, Hungary and the
Czech Republic will be accepted as new members by 1999, and the
alliance's door, however, remains open to other Central and
Eastern European countries.

<HEADLINE> US Defense Secretary Ends Gulf Tour </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, February 11 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Defense Secretary
William Cohen left for Russia Wednesday evening after ending a
four-day Gulf tour to seek support for a possible U.S.-led
military strike against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
During his tour which started on Sunday, Cohen met with
leaders of all the six Gulf Arab states and discussed with them
the current crisis between Iraq and the United Nations over arms
inspection.
</P>
<P>
He also inspected U.S. military bases in the region, including
a U.S. nuclear site in Qatar.
</P>
<P>
The six Gulf Arab states are Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Oman, the
United Arab Emirates (UAE), Qatar and Bahrain.
</P>
<P>
Cohen pointed out during his tour that if Iraq wants to avert
the strike, it must allow U.N. arms inspectors access to suspected
chemical or biological weapons sites and comply with all the U.N.
Security Council's resolutions.

<HEADLINE> Britain: No Deadline for Diplomacy on Iraq Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, February 11 (Xinhua) -- British Minister of State
for Foreign Affairs Derek Fatchett said here Wednesday the United
States and Britain do not set a deadline for diplomatic efforts to
defuse a crisis over arms inspections in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Fatchett told a press conference that London and Washington
give "perfect time" to the diplomatic efforts to resolve the
crisis.
</P>
<P>
"The British government is working hard for a diplomatic
solution (to the crisis) and that is our priority," he said.
</P>
<P>
The British official, however, said that options will be
"narrowing down" for Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, who he said
is holding the key to the crisis.
</P>
<P>
Saddam "has the ability to resolve the crisis quickly," he said.
</P>
<P>
Fatchett warned of fewer options for Saddam if he fails to
comply with the U.N. Security Council resolutions.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has barred the U.N. arms inspectors charged with
eliminating its weapons of mass destruction from searching suspect
sites, including presidential palaces.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and Britain, strengthening their military build-up in
the Gulf, say they will attack Iraq to force its compliance with
the arms inspections if the international diplomatic efforts fail.
</P>
<P>
Fatchett said a coalition against Iraq is taking shape and
being strengthened "day by day."
</P>
<P>
Six nations, namely Australia, Canada, Germany, Oman, Kuwait
and Bahrain have decided to back a possible attack by the U.S. and
Britain.
</P>
<P>
Fatchett denied reports that he is seeking the United Arab
Emirates' support for the possible military strike against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
"My visit is to underline Britain's commitment to the Gulf and
desire to consult with friends in the region about the current
crisis between the United Nations and Iraq," he said.
</P>
<P>
Fatchett arrived in the region early in the day. He came here
after a visit to Oman. He will travel to Egypt Thursday.
