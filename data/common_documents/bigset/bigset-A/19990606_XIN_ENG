<HEADLINE> Nigeria, Liberia to Cooperate for Peace in Sierra </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, June 5 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian and Liberian presidents
agree Saturday in Nigerian capital Abuja to jointly push forward
the peace process in Sierra Leone, according to a joint communique
between them published Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders also agree to resuscitate a joint commission to
improve relations between the two west Africa countries.
</P>
<P>
In the joint communique signed between Nigerian President
Olusegun Obasanjo and visiting Liberian President Charles Taylor,
the two countries commend the efforts by the Economic Community of
West African States (ECOWAS) to materialize peace in Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders reaffirmed their determination to work for the
peace and stability in West Africa so that the process of economic
development in the sub-region can be speeded up.
</P>
<P>
They welcome the recent cease-fire agreement between the
government of Sierra Leone and the Revolutionary United Front and
urged both parties to conclude, as early as possible, a final
peace agreement that will bring a lasting solution to the crisis
in that country.
</P>
<P>
Obasanjo congratulated Taylor's recent move to destroy the arms
and ammunitions surrendered by the former warring factions during
the disarmament process. They noted the destruction of these arms
will mark the final disengagement of the West Africa Peace-keeping
Force or the ECOMOG from Liberia.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders expressed their concerns at the increase in the
number of conflicts as well as their intensity. They called on all
parties concerned to embrace dialog, in the traditional African
manner.

<HEADLINE> Barak Urged to Implement Peace Agreements </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GAZA, June 5 (Xinhua) -- A senior Palestinian official Saturday
urged the Israeli leadership to implement the agreements it signed
with the Palestinians before involving in the final status
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference held here in the day, Nabil Sha'ath,
Minister of Planning and International Cooperation in the
Palestinian National Authority (PNA), expressed hope that Israeli
Prime Minister-elect Ehud Barak will revitalize the peace process
blocked by the outgoing Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli voters chose Barak to push forward and reactivate
the peace process, said Sha'ath.
</P>
<P>
The Arab parties concerned in the peace process should waste no
time in working out a common stance from now. And they need not to
wait until the new Israeli cabinet is formed.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian leadership is committed to the peace process on
three tracks of the Palestinians, Syria and Lebanon, said Sha'ath,
adding that such a coordination is crucial to avert any Israeli
attempt to prevaricate on any one of those tracks.
</P>
<P>
Reiterating the PNA support for the peace process on the Syrian
and Lebanese tracks, Sha'ath said, "they are all complementary and
aim at an overall permanent peace. "
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian Minister said he is to hold talks with Egyptian
Foreign Minister Amr Moussa in Cairo on Monday on the latest
Egyptian efforts to coordinate the Arab stances on reviving the
peace process.
</P>
<P>
He will also meet with Arab League Secretary General Ahmed
Esmat Abdel-Meguid on the issue of drawing up a constitution for
a future independent Palestinian state.

<HEADLINE> Verification of S. Africa's Election Result Enters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 5 (Xinhua) -- The process of tallying and
verifying the results of South Africa's second democratic election
entered its final phase Saturday night with officials confident of
a full result early Sunday.
</P>
<P>
By 5 p.m. Saturday, around 98 percent of the country's 14,650
voting stations had submitted their results to the Independent
Electoral Commission's results center in Pretoria, the country's
capital, the South African Press Association (SAPA) reported.
</P>
<P>
This brought the number of National Assembly ballots cast in
the election to 15.4 million of a potential 18.1 million
registered voters.
</P>
<P>
Five million of these votes still had to be verified.
</P>
<P>
The African National Congress (ANC) remained firmly in the lead
and still well-placed to obtain the coveted two-thirds majority
with 10.27 million votes which represented 66.3 percent of the
tally.
</P>
<P>
The Democratic Party remained in second place with 1.49 million
votes, and the Inkatha Freedom Party snapped at its heels with
1.29 million votes.
</P>
<P>
The IFP's hopes lay in the few stations that have not yet
reported or in a significant recalculation in their favor during
the verification process.
</P>
<P>
Almost 72 hours after polls officially closed at 9 p.m.
Wednesday, some 125 voting stations had still not made contact
with the IEC in Pretoria.
</P>
<P>
Most of the outstanding stations were in rural Eastern Cape,
where the ANC is strong, and rural areas of KwaZulu-Natal -- the
IFP's traditional stronghold.
</P>
<P>
Officials at the IEC's nerve center could not explain why the
presiding officers at these stations had not yet telephoned, but
they hoped the outstanding results might be in a pile of several
hundred faxes that were waiting to be processed at the IEC.
</P>
<P>
With an average of 3,000 voters per station, the results from
these stations could bring in more than 350,000 new votes.
</P>
<P>
With the ANC assured of returning to power in seven provincial
governments, the contests for the Western Cape and KwaZulu-Natal
were going down to the wire with no clear majorities, according to
unverified results.
</P>
<P>
A mere 10,000 votes separated the IFP and ANC in KwaZulu-Natal,
where the IFP had the edge with 42 percent against the ANC's 38.8
percent.
</P>
<P>
The DP remained in third place with 224,387 votes (8.24
percent).
</P>
<P>
In the Western Cape, the ANC enjoyed a commanding lead with
651,548 votes (41.78 percent) against the New National Party's
601,994 (38.61 percent), with the DP holding the balance of power
with 186,703 votes (11. 97 percent).
</P>
<P>
The IEC has emphasized the unverified results are in flux and
that no conclusions can be drawn from them.
</P>
<P>
Among the long rows of computer terminals on the vast floor of
the results center, the excitement of the initial rush of results
Thursday had long since dissipated.
</P>
<P>
IEC chairwoman Brigalia Bam, meanwhile, said she was satisfied
that Wednesday's poll was free and fair.
</P>
<P>
"I am more than happy... I am very satisfied these elections
have been free and fair," Bam was quoted by SAPA as saying.
</P>
<P>
The IEC planned to make an announcement Wednesday certifying
the results of the election.
</P>
<P>
Bam said only two objections had been received by the IEC by
the deadline for such submissions at 9 p.m. Friday.
</P>
<P>
One came from KwaZulu-Natal where a political party alleged a
batch of ballot boxes had gone missing. The boxes were later
found.
</P>
<P>
In the other case, the IEC ordered a recount from one voting
station in Cape Town after a party doubted its poor showing in the
area where it insisted it had wide support.
</P>
<P>
Bam declined to name the parties involved.
</P>
<P>
Although the deadline for objections had passed, parties could
still lodge complaints about the election with the Electoral Court
rather than the IEC, Bam said.
</P>
<P>
Bam, meanwhile, played down a decision by eight opposition
parties to have the results independently audited and praised the
parties for acting responsibly during the election and counting
process.
</P>
<P>
"Actually an external audit is very helpful... then we can make
sure that everything is transparently free and fair," she said.
</P>
<P>
But some parties, like the IFP, DP, NNP, Pan Africanist
Congress, Afrikaner Eenheidsbeweging, Freedom Front, the United
Democratic Movement and Federal Alliance, have supplied an
auditing company with hard copies of the result from each of the
country voting stations.
</P>
<P>
The parties have said the auditor's report would be compared
with the IEC's final finding and if any discrepancies arose which
affected the number of parliamentary seats a party should receive,
the parties would consider lodging a dispute.
</P>
<P>
With a likely turnout of around 85 percent in the election, Bam
said South Africa had set "a world record".
</P>
<P>
"No other country has broken the 80-percent mark in a second
election during the past 20 or 30 years. In some ways, we are very
different because we are a nation in transformation," she said.

Arab world. The Gulf kingdom also tops the Arab countries in
importing Egyptian goods.
</P>
<P>
Egypt's exports to Saudi Arabia stood at 467.8 million Egyptian
pounds (137.59 million U.S. dollars) in 1998, including industrial
and agricultural products, medicines, foodstuffs, livestock and

pounds (612.65 million dollars), including petrochemicals,
machines, pumps, sodium phosphates, palm oil, aluminium products
and pre-fabricated buildings.

KAMPALA, June 5 (Xinhua) -- At least 11 people were killed in
boat capsize which occurred on Lake Victoria late Friday night,
Radio Uganda reported Saturday evening.
</P>
<P>
The motorized canoe, which was carrying 15 people, was hit by
strong wind and big storms, and suddenly hit a big rock, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
Rescuers are still searching possible survivors, it added.
</P>
<P>
Visibility was very poor because of mist, Samuel Muwanguzi,
chief editor of Radio Uganda, told Xinhua Saturday evening.
</P>
<P>
Some canoes often carry more people against a relatively small
capacity and this is the key cause of accidents on the lake, he
noted.
</P>
<P>
The passengers on the ill-fortune boat were coming from the
Kalangala District in the lake to the landing site to do business
in the mainland.

ADDIS ABABA, June 5 (Xinhua) -- The Ethiopian Airlines said
Saturday that the year 2000 (Y2K) computer date recognition
problem will not affect the services rendered by the more than
half-century old airline.
</P>
<P>
Information and communication sector manager of the airline
Alemayehu Tesfaye told the Ethiopian News Agency that Ethiopian
passenger and cargo planes are safe from the computer glitch.
</P>
<P>
Alemayehu said the Ethiopian Airlines has allotted 1.39 million
U.S. dollars to address the possible effects of the Y2K problem.
</P>
<P>
He recalled that the Ethiopian Airlines, originally thought to
be one of the Y2K highly vulnerable institutions in Ethiopia, had
taken extensive measures to modernize its network systems at a
cost of 5.32 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
He said the airline has accomplished 80 percent of the Y2K
problem remedial process, adding that "the entire process is
expected to be finalized before August this year."
</P>
<P>
A Y2K National Technical Committee was established in July,
1998 in Ethiopia to combat the adverse effects of the millenium
bug in the country. The remedial process cost the Horn of Africa
country about 15.8 million U.S. dollars.

<HEADLINE> MENA Conference Depends on Progress of Mideast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, June 5 (Xinhua) -- World Economic Forum chief Klaus
Shwab said here on Saturday that a new round of Middle East and
North Africa (MENA) economic conference depended on progress of
the Mideast peace process.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters after a meeting with Egyptian Foreign
Minister Amr Moussa, Shwab said he is foreseeing little
possibility of holding the MENA conference this year if the peace
process is still stalled.
</P>
<P>
He said he opts for a "wait and see" attitude toward the
possible convocation of the regional gathering.
</P>
<P>
He said he wants to see assurances that the peace process will
resume under the future Labor-led Israeli government.
</P>
<P>
Moderate Ehud Barak, leader of the Labor Party, ousted hardline
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Israel's May 17
elections. Barak has pledged to push forward the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Shwab expressed hope that the coming months will witness
circumstances that are favorable for the MENA conference.
</P>
<P>
The Davos-based World Economic Forum helped organize the MENA
economic conference in 1994-97, which was aimed at launching
economic cooperation between Arab countries and Israel.
</P>
<P>
The conference was canceled last year due to the lack of
progress in the Middle East peace process because of Israel's
intransigent policy adopted by Netanyahu since he came to power in
1996.
</P>
<P>
Following his trip in Egypt, Shwab, who arrived here earlier
Saturday, is expected to travel to the Palestinian self-rule areas
and Israel.

<HEADLINE> Yugoslav General Fails to Turn up at Troop Withdrawal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, June 5 (Xinhua) -- General Svetozar Marjanovic, deputy
chief of the General Staff of the Yugoslav armed forces, failed to
turn up Saturday for talks with NATO on the withdrawal of Serb
troops and paramilitary forces from Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Initial reports received here said that Marjanovic was leading
the Yugoslav delegation at the talks which were scheduled to start
in Macedonia at 8:00 a.m. local time (0700 GMT).
</P>
<P>
No reason was given for the absence of Marjanovic, the ATA said
quoting a report from Skopje, capital of Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
Instead of Marjanovic, the Yugoslav delegation was led by
Assistant Secretary of the Interior Ministry Obrad Stefanovic and
General Blajodi Kovacevic, a member of the General Staff of the
Yugoslav armed forces.
</P>
<P>
The NATO side was led by British General Michael Jackson.
</P>
<P>
The talks, which were taking place at an Albanian-owned
restaurant near the Blace border post between Yugoslavia and
Macedonia, were postponed for three hours because the Yugoslav
side was not happy about the venue, citing security reasons.
</P>
<P>
NATO has said that there would be no negotiations at Saturday's
talks and all Serb troops and paramilitary forces will have to
pull out of Kosovo within seven days after an agreement on
withdrawal timetable is reached.
</P>
<P>
A British defense official in London said that some progress
had been made at the talks, which was called to work out the
details on the pullout of all Serb military forces in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
NATO has put its 16,000 troops in Macedonia on a 24-hour notice
to enter Kosovo, the southern Serbian province of Yugoslavia, to
carry out what NATO called a peacekeeping mission.
</P>
<P>
NATO air strikes on Yugoslavia are continuing even after
Yugoslavia has accepted the peace plan brokered by EU envoy and
Finnish President Marti Ahtisaari and Russian Balkans envoy Viktor
Chernomirdin.

<P>
HEFEI, Anhui, June 5 (Xinhua) -- Sichuan Fo Lan club of China
was only a step away from winning the first Asian Volleyball
Confederation(AVC) Cup Men's Club Tournament as they scored a hard-
fought three-set win over Samsung Fire &AMP; Marine Insurance club of
South Korea on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The reigning champions of China league overcame a first-set
loss to edge Samsung 23-25, 25-21, 27-25 and 25-19, coming closer
to taking the title as their Sunday's match against lowly Al-
Rayyan of Qatar was just a formality.
</P>
<P>
Both sides were deadlocked in the first set as they fought 10-
10, 15-15, 19-19 but Samsung managed to pull away by displaying a
fine balance in both attack and defence before they finished the
set to their advantage.
</P>
<P>
In the following two sets, both teams were struggling in a
seesaw match but Sichuan did a better job in blocks and spikes
before they went ahead 2-1 into the last set.
</P>
<P>
Inspired by the partisan crowd, Sichuan broke away from a 9-all
to settle the fourth set and the match as Samsung was became
liable to mistakes which cost them dearly.

<HEADLINE> Yugoslav General Fails to Turn up at Troop Withdrawal Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, June 5 (Xinhua) -- General Svetozar Marjanovic, deputy
chief of the General Staff of the Yugoslav armed forces, failed to
turn up Saturday for talks with NATO on the withdrawal of Serb
troops and paramilitary forces from Kosovo, the Albanian news
agency ATA reported.
</P>
<P>
Initial reports received here said that Marjanovic was leading
the Yugoslav delegation at the talks which were scheduled to start
in Macedonia at 8:00 a.m. local time (0700 GMT).
</P>
<P>
No reason was given for the absence of Marjanovic, the ATA said,
quoting a report from Skopje, capital of Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
Instead of Marjanovic, the Yugoslav delegation was led by
Assistant Secretary of the Interior Ministry Obrad Stefanovic and
General Blajodi Kovacevic, a member of the General Staff of the
Yugoslav armed forces.
</P>
<P>
The NATO side was led by British General Michael Jackson.
</P>
<P>
The talks, which were taking place at a restaurant near the
Blace border post between Yugoslavia and Macedonia, were postponed
for three hours because the Yugoslav side was not happy about the
venue, citing security reasons.
</P>
<P>
NATO has said that there would be no negotiations at Saturday's
talks and all Serb troops and paramilitary forces will have to
pull out of Kosovo within seven days after an agreement on
withdrawal timetable is reached.
</P>
<P>
A British defense official in London said that some progress
had been made at the talks, which was called to work out the
details on the pullout of all Serb military forces in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
NATO has put its 16,000 troops in Macedonia on a 24-hour notice
to enter Kosovo, the southern Serbian province of Yugoslavia, to
carry out what NATO called a peacekeeping mission.
</P>
<P>
NATO airstrikes on Yugoslavia are continuing even after
Yugoslavia has accepted the peace plan brokered by EU envoy and
Finnish President Marti Ahtisaari and Russian Balkans envoy Viktor
Chernomyrdin.
</P>
<P>
The international community has been urging NATO to suspend its
air campaign immediately.

<HEADLINE> Graf Beats Hingis to Win French Open Title </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, June 5 (Xinhua) -- Five-time champion Steffi Graf
rallied back from a first set deficit to beat the top-ranked
Martina Hingis to take the women's singles title of the French
Open here on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Graf won the battle of two generations 4-6, 7-5 and 6-2 as she
was crowned for the sixth time at Roland Garrous where Hingis was
still away from her first French title, the only Grand Slam crown
she hasn't won.
</P>
<P>
After tied 1-1 in the first two sets, Graf, who was playing her
first Grand Slam final in three years due to injuries, took a 2-0
lead for the first time in the final and surged again to 5-2 after
Hingis managed to claw back 2-3.
</P>
<P>
Hingis hit a backhand out of the bounds, ushering Graf to the
top spot in the podium as the crowds cheered gladly for the German
veteran.
</P>
<P>
Hingis won the first 6-4, but Graf battled back twice from a
break down in the second.
</P>
<P>
In the first set, Graf was broken in the opening game and faced
two break points after lagged behind 0-2 against 18-year-old
Hingis.
</P>
<P>
However, Graf who has bagged in 21 Grand Slam titles, fired
back to deuce before Hingis committed two more errors for 1-2 and
broke her Swiss fourth game for 2-all.
</P>
<P>
In the fifth game, Graf fought back from 30-0 before Hingis
smashed her racket to the ground in frustration and got a warning.
</P>
<P>
Hingis smiled eventually with a forehand winner at the end of a
rally, breaking her 30-year-old German opponent the second time
before surging surging ahead 5-2 for her only Grand Slam title she
hasn't won.
</P>
<P>
Yet, Graf was not in any mood to surrender without fight, and
she did managed to claw back to 4-5 with top-spin backhands before
committing errors to award Hingis to keep her 10th game for the
first-set victory.
</P>
<P>
In the second set, Graf again dropped her opening game,
awarding a 2-0 lead for Hingis who toppled Graf from the No. 1
ranking in March 1997, ending the German's record 377-week reign.
</P>
<P>
In the battle between the old guard and the new generation,
Hingis was upset by the umpire ruling of her shots and was
penalized a point for a court violation, helping Graf to take her
first game for 1-2.
</P>
<P>
With the crowd loudly behind Graf, the German veteran broke
back in the sixth game, and held her serve with another
questionable call.
</P>
<P>
The eighth game produced the most exhilarating moments with a
spectacular exchange of drop shots and lobs that ended with Graf
firing a simple smash into the net as Hingis pulled even at 4-4.
</P>
<P>
A backhand winner put Hingis a break up and let her serve for
the match, but netted a drop-shot attempt to put Graf back at 5-5
before she won the next game at love and broke Hingis again to win
the set.

<HEADLINE> Bank of Scotland Drops Deal with U.S. Evangelist </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
London, June 5 (Xinhua) -- The Bank of Scotland said on
Saturday it had scrapped plans for a controversial alliance with
U.S. television evangelist Pat Robertson, whose criticism of
Scotland embarrassed his new British partners.
</P>
<P>
In a widely expected move, the bank said it had agreed with
Robertson to end the proposed venture after the former U.S.
presidential candidate described Scotland as a dark land where
homosexuals wielded great power.
</P>
<P>
The bank's chief executive Peter Burt and Robertson agreed
during an emergency meeting in Boston on Friday that the plan to
set up a telephone-based bank, though still making good business
sense, was doomed.
</P>
<P>
The Bank of Scotland said it would buy out Robertson's stake in
the venture, believed to be worth about 50 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The Bank of Scotland had wanted to introduce the concept of
telephone-based banking, which is already popular in Britain, to
the huge U.S. market, and the preacher's millions of followers
seemed an ideal customer base.

<HEADLINE> Realignment of S. African Opposition Parties Seems </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 5 (Xinhua) -- South African opposition
parties found it hard to forge a merger against the ruling African
National Congress (ANC) because of a rift among them, analysts
here said.
</P>
<P>
There have been speculations that the Inkatha Freedom Party
(IFD) and the New National Party (NNP) would prefer to throw in
their lot with the ruling party, which won a landslide victory in
Wednesday's election.
</P>
<P>
As the opposition parties, licking their wounds from defeat by
the ANC, were making tentative future planning, it became clear
that the parties tend to cooperate with the ANC to serve their own
interests.
</P>
<P>
Coalition governments are likely to be formed in the previously
 opposition-held provinces of KwaZulu Natal and Western Cape after
a strong ANC showing in both regions.
</P>
<P>
Initial discussions were being held within the ranks of major
parties in the Western Cape about the possibility of forming a
governing coalition in the province's legislature.
</P>
<P>
It is understood that preliminary feelers are being extended
informally between some of these parties.
</P>
<P>
ANC sources said the possibility of a grand coalition between
the ANC and the NNP was being mooted in certain circles.
</P>
<P>
The Democratic Party (DP), which will take over the NNP as the
main opposition after the election, was reportedly deliberating
its possible role in a coalition with one of the bigger parties
although it has stressed throughout the election campaign that it
would do its best to avoid a coalition with the ANC at any level
-- provincial or national.
</P>
<P>
In KwaZulu Natal, analysts said the key aspect to note about
the outcome was that it ensured coalition government in the
province, and that this would be good for the province.
</P>
<P>
This is a crucial outcome that political parties ought not to
squander in the coming weeks as they meet, provincially and
nationally, to discuss coalition deals.
</P>
<P>
There is no way of knowing yet how a coalition might work in
KwaZulu Natal. Parties have been putting such thoughts aside
while campaigning in the realization that, unlike in most other
provinces, it was impossible to predict an outcome.

<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, June 5 (Xinhua) -- Italian Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini
said Saturday that the end to the conflict in Kosovo was now
irreversible.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a political rally in Sardinian town of Oristano,
Dini said that "I am convinced that the strategic decision to end
the conflict is now an irreversible process."
</P>
<P>
He added that "so even if it doesn't happen today, it will
start tomorrow, and then bombardment will cease."
</P>
<P>
He confirmed that NATO air raids over Kosovo would end just as
soon as Serb troops began their withdrawal and he said he was
confident that would be soon.
</P>
<P>
Serb and NATO representatives are meeting in Blace, Macedonia,
Saturday to set out the timing and terms of the Serbian withdrawal
from Kosovo.

<HEADLINE> Realignment of S. African Political Parties Seems </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Cooperation between the IFP and ANC would be positive for the
peace process. Moreover, KwaZulu Natal urgently needs to get up
and running efficiently, which would have been difficult -- as it
was after the 1994 election-- with one party battling to run the
province on a slim majority or with just less than 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
Genuine cooperation on peace and in government might have been
less likely had one of the parties been the clear victor -- even
if pressure from national leaders persuaded them into a coalition.
</P>
<P>
Besides, the difficulty for a merger of opposition parties is
aggravated by personal ambition, old animosities and differences
in approach, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
One of the important players in a realignment of opposition
parties, the NNP, may even be coming apart at the seams.
</P>
<P>
The possibility of a leadership struggle in the NNP leading to
its further disintegration, is not discounted by some observers.
Already there is noticeable difference of emphasis between the
attitudes of leader Marthinus van Schalkwyk and senior member of
parliament Sheila Camerer in their approach to realignment.
</P>
<P>
Getting the major players -- the DP, the IFP and the NNP -- to
join forces will require much greater efforts than expected.
</P>
<P>
Sam de Beer, former Minister in the National Party government
and leader of the NNP in Gauteng before defecting to the United
Democratic Movement (UDM), has no doubts about where van Schalkwyk
is heading.
</P>
<P>
"My feeling is he would rather live in Thabo Mbeki's shadow
than lead the NNP into a coalition with other opposition parties,"
he said in remarks published Saturday by the Citizen newspaper.
</P>
<P>
Mbeki, ANC's chairman, is set to succeed outgoing President
Nelson Mandela.
</P>
<P>
Asked what the NNP had to offer the ANC, De Beer said:
</P>
<P>
"A lot of votes and symbolism. Mbeki has been advised by
influential friends in the Afrikaner community to draw the
Afrikaners closer, to befriend them, because it would strengthen
his position."
</P>
<P>
De Beer said it would mean delivering the Western Cape, a thorn
in the side of the ANC, to them.
</P>
<P>
The ANC and NNP could form a strong coalition and govern that
province.
</P>
<P>
But De Beer foresaw that this could cause problems for the NNP
in the Western Cape where his colleagues are opposed to a
coalition with the ANC and would rather rule the province with the
help of the DP and the African Christian Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
"It must be remembered that many of the colored people do not
like the ANC at all. I am not sure that the NNP in the Western
Cape will survive such a coalition," he said.
</P>
<P>
De Beer was circumspect about which opposition parties his UDM
would consider joining forces with.
</P>
<P>
However, he said the UDM's position had always been that there
should be a realignment of opposition in South African politics in
which South Africans were consolidated under a new umbrella.
</P>
<P>
According to other sources in the party, there might be a
reluctance to enter into a coalition with the NNP due to its
baggage of the past and with the DP because it had gone
"overboard" with its election campaign.
</P>
<P>
Given the factors, there is a strong belief that the
possibility for a joint front by opposition parties seems remote.
</P>
<P>
There is, on the contrary, a strong possibility that South
Africa would become a one-party state, said analysts.

ADDIS ABABA, June 5 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopians were urged to join
hands in environmental protection as the nation marked this year's
World Environment Day Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a meeting marking the World Environment Day here,
Ethiopian Deputy Speaker of the House of the Federation Mohammed
Seraye said environmental sanitation, particularly in urban parts
of Ethiopia, is deteriorating at an alarming proportion.
</P>

environmental policy to sidestep the looming threat of
environmental degradation.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on the occasion, general manager of the Ethiopian
Environmental Protection Authority Tewolde-Berhan Gebre-Egziabher
said the authority is striving to circumvent land degradation,
environmental pollution and the problem of urban sanitation in the
country.
</P>
<P>
He called on the general public to play an active role in
national efforts geared to avert environmental pollution.
</P>
<P>
According to the Ethiopian News Agency, Addis Ababa, capital of
Ethiopia, observed this year's World Environment Day under the
theme "our earth, our future, just save it" through various
activities.

<HEADLINE> UAE Criticizes GCC Members' Rapprochement With Iran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, June 5 (Xinhua) -- The United Arab Emirates (UAE)
Saturday strongly criticized Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC)
members for improving relations with Iran, adding their move is
harmful to the UAE settlement of islands issue with Iran..
</P>
<P>
The UAE will reconsider its obligations within the framework
of the GCC if the members continue to ignore the group's
collective position regarding the islands issue, UAE Foreign
Minister Rashid Abdullah said in a televised interview.
</P>
<P>
He stressed the group's collective position links GCC relations
with Iran to finding a solution for the UAE's three islands of Abu
Moussa and Greater and Lesser Tunbs occupied by Iran, adding
the islands issue is not only a UAE issue, but also "a GCC issue
and an Arab one as well."
</P>
<P>
The UAE's dispute with Iran over the three strategic islands in
the Gulf has long been a barrier for the two countries to fully
normalize relations.
</P>
<P>
The UAE has been uneasy since Iran and some GCC countries,
especially Saudi Arabia, made efforts to improve ties last
month. But this is the first time it is openly expressing its
grievance.
</P>
<P>
"We have been optimistic about this closeness (with Iran)
earlier, but now we think that this closeness is at the expense of
the UAE," said Abdullah.
</P>
<P>
He said the GCC states have obligations and agreements within
the framework of the group, among which is that it is impossible
to establish good relations and good neighborly ties with Iran as
long as its occupation of the UAE islands continues.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah urged Iran to open negotiations with the UAE,
stressing such negotiations should not be endless.
</P>
<P>
"If we don't reach a solution through these negotiations, we
will resort to arbitration and the International Court of Justice
and then we will accept the court's decision whether it is in
favor of the UAE or in favor of Iran," he said.

CAIRO, June 5 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic briefs
from Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
DUHBAI -- An electronic trade forum of the Gulf Cooperation
Council (GCC) urged GCC member states to give more attention to
introducing e.trade in different economic activities, the London
-based Al Hayat newspaper reported on Saturday.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> China Promotes New Standards of Beer Bottles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 6 (Xinhua) -- New standards for beer bottles
manufactured and sold in China have been set in a bid to reduce
the increasing number of beer bottle explosions which are most
likely to occur with bottles that have been used for many years,
</P>
<P>
The State Bureau of Quality and Technical Supervision, the
State Administration of Light Industry and the China National
Consumers' Association have urged that all beer bottles meet the
compulsory State standards.
</P>
<P>
The new standards have definite requirements on the bottle's
resistance to internal pressure, impact resistance and thickness
of glass.
</P>
<P>
Exploding beer bottles topped the list of consumer complaints
last year, according to sources with the China National Consumers'
Association.
</P>
<P>
China is now the second largest beer producer and consumer,
with annual beer output reaching 19 million tons. However, in
recent years, more and more cases of beer bottles exploding have
been reported. In the January-September period in 1998, nearly 600
people were reportedly injured by such explosions.
</P>
<P>
The new bottles will be distinguished by a special mark "B" for
"beer", and must also display the bottle production date.
</P>
<P>
The new bottles should be used for two years, the new standards
recommend.

<HEADLINE> Factions Fighting for Baidoa Town in S. Somalia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, June 6 (Xinhua) -- Fierce fightings took place in
Baidoa town,

245 kms southwest of Somali capital Mogadishu Sunday between the
forces of Hussein Mohamed Aidid and those of the Rahanwein
Resistance Army (RRA).
</P>
<P>
RRA spokesman Mohamed Ali Aden Qalinleh confirmed the fightings
in Baidoa Sunday and told reporters here on Sunday afternoon that
the town is now "under the full control of the RRA forces".
</P>
<P>
There's no official word as yet from Aidid's side over the
fightings, but militia commanders loyal to him have denied that
the town has changed hands.
</P>
<P>
Independent sources confirmed that the town is still in Aidid's
control, but pressure is mounting high for its fall.
</P>
<P>
An eyewitness in Baidoa told Xinhua by VHF radio that he has
seen the corpses of 11 people including civilians.
</P>
<P>
The eyewitness said three of those bodies were lying on a
vehicle trying to escape to Mogadishu while the wounded are
estimated to be in dozens, mainly civilians caught in the cross
fire.
</P>
<P>
One of nine Aidid's militiamen brought for treatment in Dr.
Hassan Jis Hospital in South Mogadishu said the RRA fighters have
ambushed their vehicle heading toward the town, killing four of
the occupants.
</P>
<P>
Another wounded man said five vehicles including a public
transport bus and a battle wagon have been seized by the RRA.
</P>
<P>
According to travelers who reached Mogadishu just before noon,
there has been a total panic among the civilians in the town as
deafening noises of the heavy shellings fired by both sides
continued in the heart of Baidoa.
</P>
<P>
The eyewitnesses said the exchange of heavy anti-aircraft
machine gun fires and rocket-propelled grenades have made the town
a hell of mess while the civilians have started fleeing in panic
to every direction of the town especially toward the capital.
</P>
<P>
Heavy preparations for re-strengthening Aidid's militiamen in
Baidoa are visible in South Mogadishu Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Well-informed sources in Baidoa said that the RRA fighters have
mounted their attack on the town when a large consignment of
Somali bank notes is to arrive for businessmen at Ballidogleh
airport, 90 kilometers south of Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
But sources close to the businessmen said the Somali bank notes
are more likely to arrive tomorrow and therefore plans for its
escort has made several battle wagons leave Baidoa, thus reducing
Aidid's militia power in the town.

just ended an inspection tour of Yunnan Province in southwest
China, during which she called for further opening by the province
based on its comparative advantages over other regions.
</P>
<P>
During her tour from June 2 to 6, Wu visited the World
Horticulture Exposition and the seventh Kunming Trade Fair now
going on in the provincial capital.
</P>
<P>
She also chaired a working conference on border trade,
inspected an export farm products base and met with local
officials, workers, farmers, scientists, technologists and school
children.

world, as indicated by its consecutive 10 percent gross domestic
products growth in recent years, the investment of more than one
billion U.S. dollars by overseas investors in over 1,700 overseas-
funded enterprises and the re-opening of border trade last year.
</P>
<P>
The state councilor also hailed the successful hosting of the
horticulture fair by Yunnan, which has attracted delegations from
69 countries and regions as well as 26 international organizations.
</P>
<P>
According to Wu, the fair provides a good opportunity for the
world to discover Yunnan and would have a deep impact on its
opening to the world.
</P>
<P>
She called on local officials to further emancipate their minds
and stressed the need for the province to utilize its comparative
advantage in opening to the world.
</P>
<P>
She cited tourism, flower and vegetable growing as sectors in
which Yunnan has a strong competitive advantage.
</P>
<P>
Noting that border trade plays a major role in local economies
in border areas, the state councilor urged customs and other
authorities to maintain a tough stance on smuggling activities.
</P>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 6 (Xinhua) -- Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi
would visit South Africa before the inauguration of
president-to-be Thabo Mbeki, President Nelson Mandela said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Mandela made the announcement in Cape Town after lunch with
Gaddafi's wife, Safia Farkash Alba Rassi, and her daughters Aisha
and Hanna, South African Press Association. reported.
</P>
<P>
"As head of state he will be well received," Mandela was quoted
as saying.
</P>
<P>
Mandela again thanked the Libyan leader for his contribution to
the South African liberation struggle, saying that "President
Gaddafi has done a lot for us and at a time when very few people,
especially in the West, did not identify with our struggle."
</P>
<P>
"He gave us all the resources he could afford to us," said the
retiring president.
</P>
<P>
"Those who feel we should have no relations with Gaddafi have
no morals," he said. "Those who feel irritated by our friendship
with President Gaddafi can go and jump in the pool."
</P>
<P>
Speaking through an interpreter, Rassi thanked Mandela for his
help during "our problems". She was apparently referring to the
10-year-old Lockerbie dispute, which with the help of Mandela was
finally resolved earlier this year.

<P>
Gaddafi at last agreed to hand over two suspects to be tried in
the netherlands under the international court of the Hague under
the conditions of Libya. And the United Nations promised to lift
the sanctions against Libya.

what we are saying, can go and drink from the sea."

<HEADLINE> Setter Zhou Sets Mind on Volleyball By sportswriter Liu Guang </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HEFEI, ANHUI, June 6 (Xinhua) -- Chinese national setter Zhou
Jian'an weathered tormenting bench career and showed his intense
liking for volleyball before he finally hit the double success in
both courts and coaching post.
</P>
<P>
Zhou, who used to be a player-and-coach, celebrated his first
stint as the head coach with a title of the first Asian Volleyball
Confederation(AVC) Cup Men's Club Tournament here as the Sichuan
Folan club maintained a clean record by thrashing the last
opponent Al-Rayyan of Qatar in three sets on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Being the youngest coach in the China volleyball League, Zhou,
35, is also an old mariner on national squad where he has spent 12
years and had made his name with a bundle of Asian championships
under his belt.
</P>
<P>
Looking back to the bygone days, the setter put his bosom
feeling in a simple word -- persistence.
</P>
<P>
"I began playing career twenty year ago, now what I feel most
was persistence"
</P>
<P>
 "When you have difficulties, you are supposed to persist.
When you are exhausted in training, you are supposed to persist."
He added.
</P>
<P>
Zhou persisted through growing pains as he was benched for up
to three years in the national squad and did not know for long
what the feeling of being started was.
</P>
<P>
Zhou was not disillusioned either while the Chinese national
squad struggled in the low ebb and had not won any Asian Champions
since the 1986 Asian Games.
</P>
<P>
His persistence was rewarded in 1991 when he, 26 then, earned
a regular spot and was captained in the national team.
</P>
<P>
He showed his faith to the national team and did not follow
the footsteps of some teammates who retired after the team
finished fourth and slumped to a new low at the 1993 Asian
championships.
</P>
<P>
"Though several starters quit, I did not want to follow suit."
Zhou said." I knew the force of the national squad would have been
sapped a great deal, which was not what I wanted to see. That is
why I stayed on." said Zhou.
</P>
<P>
He persisted this way as the national team fluctuated in
fortunes and experienced the alternation of four head coaches
before China volleyball returned to Asian powerhouse.
</P>
<P>
Zhou, a man of his words, called it a day early last year at
the age of 34 but soon broke his promise as he was recalled back
to the national team for the World Championships in Japan and the
Asian Games later.
</P>
<P>
As the speculation mounted that it might be his last time to be
on international arena, Zhou said that he would go back again so
long as he is needed.
</P>
<P>
Besides his international duty, he also took the helm of
Sichuan Fo Lan club which he guided to the champions of the league
in 1998-99 season and qualified for the AVC Cup Men's Club
Tournament."
</P>
<P>
Asked if he would giving up the double role of player-coach, he
said that he still wanted to made full use of his experience and
his healthy conditions still could live up to the demand by the
international events.

<HEADLINE> Television Price War Forces Manufacturer to Rethink Strategy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 6 (Xinhua) -- The long running price war amongst
China's domestic TV manufacturers and retailers has had a negative
impact on the industry according to Guo Zeli, general manager of
Xiahua Electronics Co. Ltd. who believes that the market has
deteriorated as a result.
</P>
<P>
It has resulted in over production, unwise investment policies
and an unreasonable product mix, he says. His company is now
rethinking its marketing and sales strategy.
</P>
<P>
Guo believes that the first priority should be to speed up the
re-structuring of the different models available and boost
research into new technology. He explains that some newly
introduced products like multi-media TVs and super-screen TVs have
demonstrated the positive impact of new technology and have
overall enjoyed an increasing market share regardless of their
high prices.
</P>
<P>
As one of China's leading color television manufacturers and
exporters, the company has now reset its targets from Southeast
Asia to other areas such as Africa, South America, Middle East and
Eastern Europe. There is also a wider product mix, ranging from
multi-media television units to display units, fax machines and
other communication products, and the company's exports include
technology, capital and professional expertise, according to Guo.
</P>
<P>
In the face of the ongoing price war, Guo stresses that his
focus will be on the research of advanced technology, especially
as the Xiahua company along with Tianjin University and the
Chinese Academy of Sciences co-designed and produced the first
digital television in China in 1998.
</P>
<P>
"Our company has now started to re-adjust our industrial
structure by investing nearly 300 million yuan (36 million US
dollars) to set up communication and information industries, in a
bid to create new profit-earning sectors," said Guo.
</P>
<P>
Xiahua has also recently sent senior management personnel to EU
Headquarters in Brussels to prepare answers to allegations of "
dumping", the first Chinese company to take legal action against
such charges by the European Union, which started accusing China
of this practice in 1988. As a result it used high taxes to block
the exporting and marketing of Chinese color televisions in the EU.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Unveils China's Own "Venus" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, June 6 (Xinhua) -- In a bid to tackle head on
Microsoft emperor Bill Gates in his Venus Plan project for use
with ordinary televisions, which he announced in Shenzhen in early
March, the Shanghai Gotop Research Co. Ltd. today unveiled a
similar, rival net-surfing gadget, the East-1 machine.
</P>
<P>
Part of the company's much vaunted "East Plan", the new East-1
machine can enable users of regular TV sets to have access to the
Internet for on-line games, software, e-mails and other facilities,
Gotop's general manager Cui Wei said at a news conference here
today.
</P>
<P>
Customers can also use the new product for word processing just
like the personal computer and may use it as a fax machine as well
as a video CD player, according to Cui.
</P>
<P>
The Shanghai Yihao Industrial Co. Ltd. signed a contract with
the Gotop to buy 100,000 of its East-1 on the spot.
</P>
<P>
Industry analysts have an optimistic view on the future of the
new products as China remains the world's largest potential
computer and electrical appliances market.
</P>
<P>
The availability of personal computers to Chinese families is
less than three percent and China's "netizens" have just exceeded
two million.
</P>
<P>
"Since the East-1 has been researched and developed by domestic
manufacturers, its price will be only half of the Venus operating
system," Cui said.

XINING, June 6 (Xinhua) -- China's Qinghai Province has
developed three interprovincial tourism routes to attract more
tourists.
</P>
<P>
A local tourism official says that they have automobile trips
to the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, a tour of the southern parallel

Dynasty (618-907) to Tibet.
</P>
<P>
The 2,200 km of routes start in Xining, Qinghai's capital, and
end in Lhasa, the capital of the Tibet Autonomous Region. It
passes through more than 20 famous historical and nature sites
like Qinghai Lake and the Kunlun Mountains.
</P>
<P>
The southern parallel section of the "Silk Road" played an
important role in the formation and development of the road and
ancient trade. It started in Xining and ran across the desert in
Qinghai, ending at the Dunhuang Grottos in Gansu Province.
</P>
<P>
On the way from Xining to Lhasa, tourists can watch Tibetan

<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, June 6 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President B.J. Habibie
has wished the nation safe polling day on Monday.
</P>
<P>
"Wishing the nation safe polling day. May God shows us the way
to uphold safety and integrity," Habibie said in a televised
speech to the nation on Sunday night about the general election on
the eve of the polling day.
</P>
<P>
He called on all eligible voters in the country to use their
intelligence when deciding on which party to choose on polling day
and not to be emotional.
</P>
<P>
The head of state noted that the June 7 election this year is
the first democratic experience for Indonesians (since the New
Order era led by former President Soeharto), as all voters can
freely chose their representatives.
</P>
<P>
On the winner or loser of the election, he noted firmly that it
is a natural thing in every election.
</P>
<P>
"Democracy can only be built by a nation which is able to
restrain themselves, accept the winners without underestimating
others and the losers accepting without taking hostile actions
against the winner," he said.
</P>
<P>
On the just-finished campaign period, the head of state
extended his judgment that the phase has run peacefully.
</P>
<P>
"If there were some violations, I am sure it was within the
normal limit," he said and he extended his gratitude to all the
campaign participants.
</P>
<P>
The government also expressed its gratitude to all countries
and international institutions, particularly the U.N. Development
Program, for having extended assistance for the success of the
general election, he added.
</P>
<P>
The country's 112 million eligible voters will elect 462
candidates to the 500-seat House of Representatives (parliament)
in the election. The remaining 38 seats will be reserved for the
Armed Forces which do not vote.

During the five month period, the local taxation department has
collected 113.5 million yuan from foreign invested companies, up
35 on an annual basis.

<HEADLINE> Official: Russian Army Must be Re-equipped </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
MOSCOW, June 6 (Xinhua) -- Russian Deputy Prime Minister Ilya
Klebanov said Sunday that Russia's army must be re-equipped in
light of the Yugoslav crisis.
</P>
<P>
"We must urgently supply powerful, high-precision weapons,
which we have, to the armed forces," Klebanov, in charge of the
military industrial complex, said in St. Petersburg, where he was
attending celebrations of the 200th anniversary of the birth of
poet Alexander Pushkin.
</P>
<P>
Russia "possesses many new types of weapons and financing is
needed for their production," the Interfax news agency quoted him
as saying.
</P>
<P>
"The condition of the Russian defense industry is in very bad
condition," Klebanov said, adding that "exporting enterprises
survive, but the ones without this component have ceased to exist.
"
</P>
<P>
He said the government would set up five defense agencies as a
priority to "begin an inventory of defense enterprises in a month,
so that industrial concerns can be created."
</P>
<P>
In another related development, Interfax quoted diplomatic
sources as saying that Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov will
fly to Bonn Monday for an emergency meeting of the so-called G8
foreign ministers on Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
The visits of Austrian and Uzbek foreign ministers, Wolfgang
Schussel and Abdulaziz Kamilov, originally scheduled for Monday,
have been put off under mutual understandings, Interfax said.

<P>
HONG KONG, June 6 (Xinhua) -- Chinese divers clinched two more
trophies on Sunday to bring their gold medal tally to five on the
closing day of the Hong Kong Diving Meet.
</P>
<P>
Chinese world champion Yu Zhoucheng outclassed his teammate and
arch-rival Wang Tianling to win the men's three-meter springboard
on 723.39 points.
</P>
<P>
Li Na and Sang Xue, both from China, finished first and second
places in the women's 10-meter platform.
</P>
<P>
"I have collected nine world titles and more than 20 national
champions and the only title I'll have to win is from the Olympic
Games," said Yu, who lost to Wang in the one-meter springboard two
days ago.
</P>
<P>
Yu, 23, was crowned at last year's world championships in Perth,
took the lead from Wang, the World Cup runner-up this year, after

The women's 10-meter platform became the showcase of two
Chinese women.

<P>
Fourteen-year-old Sang Xue, champion of this year's World Cup,
came from behind to overpass her teammate Li Na after the second
dive, but she got only 52.13 points in the following dive,
conceding the lead to 15-year-old Li.
</P>
<P>
Li, who won the China Open a week ago, won the title while Sang
was second with a difference of 27.42 points.

<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, June 6 (Xinhua) -- Six people were killed and 5 others
wounded on Sunday in a mine explosion in southeastern Turkey, the
semi-official Anatolia News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The agency said that a mine, planted by the rebels of the
outlawed Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK), exploded when a group of
village guards were on duty to comb the mines near Konur village
of Semdinli town in Hakkari province bordering Iran.
</P>
<P>
Six people including five village guards died and five others
were wounded in the mine blast, said the agency.
</P>
<P>
It added that the wounded were rushed to the Hakkari Military
Hospital for treatment.
</P>
<P>
The PKK has been fighting a 15-year-long separatist war for
an independent Kurdish state in southeastern Turkey, which has
claimed over 37,000 lives since August 1984.
</P>
<P>
The trial of PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan, who was charged with
treason, started on Monday on the Imrali Island near Turkey's
western province of Bursa.
</P>
<P>
The trial is widely expected to end with a death sentence
for Ocalan, whom Turkey holds responsible for the 37,000 deaths
in the 15-year-conflicts.
</P>
<P>
Ocalan was captured by Turkish special agents in Kenya in
mid-February.

<HEADLINE> Blair Says UK Euro Entry Depends on Economy Ahead of Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 6 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony Blair
said on Sunday the time of a referendum for the country to join a
single European currency depends on the success of the euro
project and the economic conditions being right for its entry.
</P>
<P>
"We do want to be part of a successful single currency but it
has to be successful and the economic conditions for Britain have
to be right," Blair told BBC Television.
</P>
<P>
Blair's ruling Labor Party, which has tried cautiously to steer
Britain and its economy closer to European integration, does not
want the European parliamentary elections to be held on June 10 to
become an unofficial referendum on the euro.
</P>
<P>
Blair derided the opposition Conservative party's calls for
Britain to ditch the National Changeover Plan, which sets out a
series of measures to prepare the country for eventual entry into
the euro.
</P>
<P>
"The idea that the Conservative party have now come out with
that we should cancel the changeover plan to that we couldn't join
(the euro) even if we wanted to is very foolish indeed," Blair
said.
</P>
<P>
The Conservative Shadow Chancellor Frnacis Maude claimed on
Sunday that Blair wanted to "railroad" Britain into political
union with Europe.
</P>
<P>
He said the prime minister "gives in" to EU moves towards
federalism while making "macho noises" about supporting UK
interests.
</P>
<P>
The issue of Britain's entry into the euro emerged into the
political agenda this week as the Conservatives gambled on
hardening resistance to the ailing currency just as the euro fell
to record lows against the dollar and pound.

WASHINGTON, June 6 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading U.S. newspapers Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- NATO commanders Saturday presented Yugoslav military
officers with detailed plans for the withdrawal of Serb-led
Yugoslav forces from Kosovo, but the five-hour meeting near
Macedonia's border with the Serbian province ended inconclusively
and the two sides agreed to resume talks on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- A whole country is wondering what to eat after steak,chicken,
eggs, pastries, waffles and more were pulled from supermarket
shelves or considered suspect. Cancer-causing dioxin in
contaminated animal feed is feared to have spread through the
Belgian food chain.
</P>
<P>
-- Fighters reported to be Muslim rebels killed 19 civilians
and wounded 4 in the worst violence in Algeria since the election

accord over an amnesty.

<HEADLINE> China Prepares for Possible Flood on Yangtze (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 6 (Xinhua) --Despite the huge enthusiasm and work
devoted to reinforcing river bank dykes, senior Chinese officials
are still urging provinces along Yangtze to stay on full alert to
combat potential floods this year.
</P>
<P>
Wang Shengfu, a senior engineer of the Beijing-based State
Flood Control and Drought Prevention Headquarters, explained that
the main river embankment has experienced hundreds of years of
water erosion.
</P>
<P>
"Reconstruction of the dykes has been limited to extending
height and width, and few things can be done to consolidate the
foundations," Wang added.
</P>
<P>
"The main river levee can only sustain floods that may occur
every 10 to 20 years if no flood discharge method is used." he
added.
</P>
<P>
Floods have ravaged this largest river in China every ten years
on average and one of the main solutions for protecting the people
from frequent flooding lies in a comprehensive upgrading of the
river's flood discharge capacity.
</P>
<P>
Now a mammoth project is tackling that and also involves
relocating some 2 million people out of the low land areas to keep
them away from frequent flood attacks.
</P>
<P>
By the time the project is finished in three to five years, the
flood discharge capacity of the river is expected to be expanded
by 10 billion cu.m., which is equal to a half of the water
retaining capacity of the world's largest hydro-electric facility
of the Three Gorges which is underway on the middle reaches of the
Yangtze.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, last month a long range weather forecast released by
the Hydrological Bureau under the Yangtze River Water Resources
Committee (YWRC) warned of a high probability of big floods this
summer. It says that the Hanjiang River, the largest tributary to
the upper reaches of the Yangtze, is likely to gain more
precipitation this year, expected to be 30 percent more than in a
normal year.
</P>
<P>
It also expects typhoons along the lower reaches of the river,
which would increase the possibility of a major flooding.
</P>
<P>
The flood season of the river usually comes in June, as it did
last year, and went on for more than two months claiming thousands
of lives and inundating 240,000 sq.km fertile farmland of this
major grain production center in China. Direct economic losses of
lthe 1998 summer flooding amounted to 200 billion yuan in the
river basin.
</P>
<P>
The 3,600 km long Yangtze River embankment is a crucial bulwark
to protect China's most vigorous economic belt, whose
effectiveness accounts for a third of the country's total economic
returns.
</P>
<P>
However, with this year's flood season imminent, several of the
provinces along the Yangtze worst hit by last year's unprecedented
deluge say they are more assured of the flood-fighting abilities
of the river dykes.
</P>
<P>
This confidence comes, to some extent, from the robust cash
injection made mainly by Hunan, Hubei, Jiangxi, Jiangsu, Anhui
provinces and Shanghai Municipality to repair and reinforce the
river embankment and prepare anti-flood equipment since the flood
water retreated last year.
</P>
<P>
Hubei on the middle reaches of the river has, for example,
pooled 5 billion yuan for building anti-flood facilities, which
surpassed the total sum for the previous ten years. The province
has the longest stretch of the main river embankment, which runs
for 1,100 km.
</P>
<P>
At the Tiaoguanji section of the river in the province, a new
levee planted with green grass has taken the place of a one meter
high secondary dyke built with plastic sand bags, with which
thousands of army soldiers and local people prevented the flood
water from overflowing last summer. Now, it is 1.1 meters higher
and two meters wider than last year.
</P>
<P>
"There is a rumor about a major flood this summer. But I'm not
too worried. I think the dyke is now able to withstand it," said
Fu Chuyuan, a farmer living in Dongsheng Village near Tiaoguanji.
</P>
<P>
He was stationed on the river embankment fighting the floods
for two months last summer and the memory of that disaster is
still clear in his mind.

"The rebuilding work of flood-damaged levees and secondary
dikes along the middle and lower river has been, so far,
successfully carried out," said Zhou Wenzhi, vice-minister of
water resources, earlier in May.
</P>
<P>
There are some 800 technicians now working along the river to
inspect the quality of dyke construction, according to sources
with the YWRC.
</P>
<P>
In the Jingzhou section, which is considered to be the most
vulnerable section of Yangtze river levees and where some 130
people were engulfed by the raging flood water here last summer,
the bustling construction of embankments, which has gone on for
months, has just come to an end. The main embankment that protects
337 km long river at this section is one meter higher on average
than last year.
</P>
<P>
Local dyke construction officials told Xinhua that contracted
construction mechanisms, machinery engineering and advanced anti-
permeate methods have been introduced in many parts of levee
reconstruction along the river, which used to be done by hard
manual labor.

<HEADLINE> Coach Ma Junren's Runner Dong Humiliated in National CP Final </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, June 6 (Xinhua) -- Dong Yanmei, a former star runner
from legendary coach Ma Junren's training camp, suffered a
humiliating defeat in the women's 5,000 meters event at the
National Grand Prix finals here on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Dong, who broke the world record of the same event on the same
track in the Chinese Eighth National Games in 1997, was never in
contention for the title and left far behind after 2000 meters.
</P>
<P>
She clocked a pedestrian time of 16 minutes 21.61 seconds to
finish seventh in her speciality event, which featured eight
runners.
</P>
<P>
Zheng Guixia, who beat Dong one month ago in the Jinan stage of
the Grand Prix series, took a solo run after five laps, winning
the title in 15:31.91.
</P>
<P>
The world record of 14:28.09 was held by Dong's teammate Jiang
Bo, also a member of Ma's Family Army who failed to qualify for
the Grand Prix finals.
</P>
<P>
"Coach Ma did not train us for a long time, " Dong said. "
Without him, we have no confidence during any competitions. I only
hope he can train us again."
</P>
<P>
Ma, who failed to show up in this meet, has been kept busy
establishing a new training center, Dong said.
</P>
<P>
Dong said coach Ma was upset for failing to take part in the
Bangkok Asian Games last December.
</P>
<P>
"He's still unhappy with that," Yang said. "But he hopes he
could lead the runners to world stadium again and win more honors
for our country."

<HEADLINE> 13-kilogram Tumour Removed from Yemeni Woman's Ovary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANAA, June 6 (Xinhua) -- Gynecologists at the Kuwait
University Hospital in Sanaa have successfully removed a
13-kilogram tumour from the right ovary of a Yemeni woman in her
fifties.
</P>
<P>
Mohamed Rifaat Salahuddin, consultant and chief gynecologist at
the hospital, perform the operation last Monday after thorough
examination, laboratory and ultra-sound tests, and careful
observation.
</P>
<P>
The patient was suffering from the tumour that was growing in
size over the past 15 years, the Yemeni news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Dr Rifaat has urged women to follow their menstrual changes or
pelvis pains to have regular check-ups even if they have no clear
symptoms.
</P>
<P>
The early discovery of tumours and prompt treatment is a
must, he said, lest they may develop into malignant tumours which
may endanger patients' life.

<HEADLINE> Kunming Trade Fair Opens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, June 6 (Xinhua) -- The annual 1999 Kunming Trade Fair
opened here today in this capital of Yunnan Province in southwest
China.
</P>
<P>
The trade fair, the seventh, comes at a time when "the city of
spring" is the focus of world attention as it hosts the World
Horticulture Exposition.
</P>
<P>
Enterprises from all over China and 18 countries and regions,
including the United States, France, Japan and others attended the
fair's opening ceremony, according to the organizers.
</P>
<P>
Apart from export sales, which was the only theme of the
previous events, the organizers said this year they have organized
talks on foreign investment projects between overseas trade
organizations, multinationals and Chinese enterprises.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, State Councilor Wu Yi, who was in
Kunming for the trade fair, met with senior trade officials from
Vietnam, Thailand, Burma and Laos, as well as representatives of
Siemens and other multinationals present.
</P>
<P>
She told them that reform and opening to the outside world is a
basic and long term policy of the Chinese government and that
China is very willing to develop trade ties with its neighbors,
including the four countries mentioned.
</P>
<P>
She expressed the wish that foreign enterprises would further
expand their economic and technological co-operation with central
and western Chinese regions.
</P>
<P>
According to the state councilor, China managed a 7.8 percent
growth in its gross domestic products and a stable currency in
1998, despite the adverse impact of last summer's severe flood and
the Asian financial crisis.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia Raises Banking License Minimum Capital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, June 6 (Xinhua) -- The National Bank of Ethiopia
said its minimum paid-up capital required for a banking business
license had been raised to 75 million birr or 9.47 million U.S.
dollars.
</P>
<P>
The Ethiopian Herald newspaper Sunday quoted Governor of the
central bank, Tekle-Wold Atnafu as saying recently that it has
become necessary to raise the minimum capital required for bank
establishment from 10 million birr (1. 26 million dollars) to 75
million birr so that the newly-established bank can successfully
compete with the existing ones.
</P>
<P>
Tekle-Wold said that as banks continue to expand their
business, they must maintain a level of capital commensurate with
the volume of their business to withstand adverse operational
result.
</P>
<P>
The new directive would bolster the capacity of private banks
in competing with the state-owned bank, the governor said, adding
that it will also help to create a strong financial administration
system.
</P>
<P>
Already established banks with paid-up capital below 75 million
birr shall raise it to the amount indicated in three years,
according to the new directive.

<HEADLINE> Former Israeli PM Denies Seeking Presidency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 6 (Xinhua) -- Former Israeli Prime Minister
Shimon Peres Sunday dismissed as "groundless nonsense" the reports
on Israeli televisions last week which said he is seeking to
replace Ezer Weizman as Israel's president.
</P>
<P>
After meeting with Prime Minister-elect Ehud Barak, Peres told
reporters that they had reached understanding on his future, but
declined to give further details.
</P>
<P>
Israel's Channel One reported last Friday that Weizman, who is
serving a second five-year term starting last year, is
considering resigning at the beginning of next year and Peres is
being mentioned as a possible successor.
</P>
<P>
The presidential office has denied the report.
</P>
<P>
The Haaretz daily Sunday quoted sources close to Peres, No. 2
in One Israel led by Barak, as saying that he would prefer to
serve in the new government if Barak keeps his promise to award
him a senior role in the peace process.
</P>
<P>
After late Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin was assassinated by an
ultra-nationalist in 1995, Peres, the then Labor Party leader,
succeeded as premier and appointed Barak as foreign minister
before outgoing Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu won the 1996
election.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, Barak was elected leader of the Labor, part of One
Israel.
</P>
<P>
Winning the Nobel prize for his positive role in the 1993
historic Oslo Accord with the Palestinians, the dovish former
prime minister has voiced support for an independent Palestinian
state.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at an international poets festival Saturday, Peres
said "there is nothing better for the state of Israel than a free
Palestinian state."
</P>
<P>
Barak, who ousted Netanyahu in the Israeli elections last
month, is continuing talks with potential coalition partners
Sunday in an effort to build broad-based government.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka Considers Quitting World Rubber Pact </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, June 6 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka is considering to
withdraw from the International Natural Rubber Organization (INRO)
following Malaysia and Thailand as the world's only commodity pact
has failed to prop up tumbling world prices, officials said
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
A firm decision will be taken once the cabinet approval is
given, said a Plantation Ministry official.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka produces about 100,000 tons of rubber annually, or 2
percent of the world's total output. Its rubber exports in raw and
manufactured form totaled 224 million U.S. dollars in 1998,
equivalent to 4.6 percent of total export earnings.
</P>
<P>
According to the INRO rules, once a member country officially
decides to leave the organization, it must inform the INRO council
and the United Nations. The membership ends one year after INRO
and the United Nations are officially informed.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia served notice last year that it would withdraw from
the INRO and the withdrawal will come into effect in October 1999.
On March 18 this year, Thailand also confirmed its intention to
pull out of the organization as it has failed to shore up rubber
prices, now deemed at historical lows.
</P>
<P>
Prices have fallen to 0.7 U.S. dollars per kilogram now from
1.05 dollars per kilogram a year ago.
</P>
<P>
Industry officials said INRO is doomed to collapse with the
withdrawal of Thailand and Malaysia which together account for
more than 50 percent of the world's production.
</P>
<P>
The two Asian members have said they would start their own
rubber intervention schemes.
</P>
<P>
The INRO, set up in 1980 to stabilize world rubber prices under
the U.N. Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), groups six
rubber producing and 16 consuming countries.
</P>
<P>
The producers are Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia, Cote d'Ivoire,
Nigeria and Sri Lanka.
</P>
<P>
The consumers are the United States, Japan, China, Germany,
France, Austria, Belgium, Luxembourg, Denmark, Finland, Greece,
Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, Sweden and Britain.
</P>
<P>
INRO has historically succeeded in stabilizing rubber supply
and prices but more recently failed to prop up sagging prices due
to a shortage of fund for the intervention purchase.

<HEADLINE> Charity Action Helps Ethnic Chinese Regain Sight </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bao Minghai, who oversees the project in west China's Xinjiang,
said that 15,000 cataract victims in the remote autonomous region
have undergone eye operations, with 98 percent recovering their
vision.
</P>
<P>
"Nine out of ten of these patients are ethnic Chinese, who have
been farming for generations in Xinjiang, a high-incidence area of
the disease because of long sunshine hours, strong ultraviolet
rays, and rough and windy weather," said Bao.
</P>
<P>
Cataracts have made 70,000 people in Xinjiang virtually blind
and the number is growing by 10,000 a year. Many patients there
have lived in darkness for a long time because of the lack of
adequate and timely medical treatment.
</P>
<P>
Since the Sightfirst project was kicked off in Xinjiang two
years ago, medical teams have been dispatched to remote and
poverty-stricken areas to carry out cataract operations as well as
those taking place in 40 special hospitals. Surveys on the extent
of eye disease in the autonomous region have also been carried out.
</P>
<P>
The program in Xinjiang is part of the nation-wide Sightfirst
China Action, launched in 1997 by the Lions Clubs, a global non-
governmental charity organization set up to help cataract
sufferers. There are now four million cataract patients in the
country, and the number is surging by 400,000 annually.

<HEADLINE> Israel to Deport 86 Illegal Foreign Workers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 6 (Xinhua) -- Israel has decided to deport 86
illegal foreign workers after they were found engaging in
illegitimate activities in Israel, it was officially announced here
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Eighty-six illegal foreign workers were caught in such
activities as smuggling and prostitution in Israel and deportation
orders were issued against them, the announcement said.
</P>
<P>
The announcement neither gave exact figures of illegal foreign
workers now in Israel nor named the countries those workers came
from. But it was the first deportation Israel has taken against
foreign workers in recent years.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Interior Ministry has prepared a bill to
establish detention centers for illegal foreign workers awaiting
for deportation.
</P>
<P>
The bill made available to the media last week even though it
has not yet been approved by the cabinet.
</P>
<P>
The bill, an amendment to the Entry to Israel law, provides
that the authorities bring the detainee before a special court if
he or she is still in the country two weeks after the detention.
</P>
<P>
It also makes provisions for releasing illegal workers on bail
until their expulsion if they meet certain conditions. It also
establishes the fact that illegal workers must pay for their
upkeep in the detention center until they are deported.
</P>
<P>
The ministry wrote that the country has been swamped by illegal
workers over the past few years, and in August 1996 the government
decided to take drastic action to reduce their number.

<HEADLINE> China Focuses On Eye Problems of Aged People </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 6 (Xinhua) -- Teams of optometrists took to the
streets in Beijing and other major Chinese cities today, giving up
their weekend, to preach the importance of eye protection,
especially for aged people.
</P>
<P>
China ushered in its fourth National Healthy Eye Day today and
it focuses on "protecting the eyesight of old people so as to
improve the quality of their life".
</P>
<P>
Some famous eye experts in Beijing noted that among China's 12
million people with eyesight disabilities, some two thirds, or
eight million, are senior citizens.
</P>
<P>
Aged people in China mainly suffer from eye diseases such as
cataracts, glaucoma and pathological changes of the retina caused
by diabetes.
</P>
<P>
"With major cities like Beijing and Shanghai having an
increasingly aging society, it is of critical importance to help
the 120 million senior citizens aged above 60 across the country
to enhance their awareness of eye protection," said He Rencheng,
president of the Beijing-based Tongren Hospital which is famous
for curing eye diseases.
</P>
<P>
An official with the Beijing Municipal Anti-Blindness Office
said that the office will host lectures on eye diseases prevention
in local senior citizens' homes or entertainment centers for the
aged.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Par't Urged to Heed Environment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, June 6 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian Conservation Foundation
(NCF) has urged the Nigerian National Assembly to set up a special
committee to deal with environmental matters, local media reported
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
At a public symposium to mark the World Environmental Day
Saturday, Aminu-Kano, executive director of the non-governmental
organization, said that his foundation has already approached some
of the law makers.
</P>
<P>
The law makers have been intimated of the need to facilitate
the establishment of such a committee to see that all issues on
conservation of nature and environment are given desired attention
as soon as they come before the National Assembly or parliament.
</P>
<P>
"From the response so far got from some of the members we
talked to, there are positive signs that they will consider the
request when both houses (of parliament) start deliberating on the
issues," he said.
</P>
<P>
The executive said that his foundation has been collecting
views of people on the debate whether to create a full fledged
ministry of environment.
</P>
<P>
But he added that what is important is to have an effective,
coordinated policy which will ensure that whatever the government
settles for will be the best for the most populous African
country.
</P>
<P>
According to him, "it was after the inception of the NCF in
1980 that the idea of having the Federal Environmental Protection
Agency metamorphosed into reality through our input."
</P>
<P>
He said what is important now is for the government to create
the enabling environment as a tool to protect the environment.
</P>
<P>
He added that if the environmental protection agency or any
other agency is made able to handle the challenges better, the
debate of whether to have a ministry of environment will be
unnecessary.

<HEADLINE> China's Tariff Revenue Surges in First 5 Months </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 6 (Xinhua) China's tariff revenue soared 116.9
percent to an historical high of 63.12 billion yuan in the first
five months of this year, thanks to a nationwide crackdown on
smuggling since last July, customs officials said here today.
</P>
<P>
Officials from the General Administration of Customs said the
figure is 34.02 billion yuan more than that of the same period
last year and accounts for 77 percent of the target set for 1999.
</P>
<P>
The officials said the crackdown on smuggling has helped
maintain normal trade order based on fair competition, thus
producing a sharp rise in the volume of normal trade.
</P>
<P>
Customs figures show that the country's volume of imports hit
25.06 billion U.S. dollars in the first five months, 81.3 percent
up on a yearly basis.
</P>
<P>
According to the officials, many industrial sectors have
reported improvements in price and profit levels since the anti-
smuggling campaign was launched.
</P>
<P>
For example, the petro-chemical sector, which reported a loss
of three billion yuan in the first quarter of 1998, recorded a
profit of 3.69 billion yuan in the first three months, despite a
fall in the international oil price.
</P>
<P>
The customs officials said the crackdown on smuggling would be
continued and that they would not allow a comeback by the
smugglers.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria's Party Rejects Ministerial Offer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, June 6 (Xinhua) -- The Alliance for Democracy (AD), a
major Nigerian political party, has rejected an offer by President
Olusegun Obasanjo of inviting former presidential aspirant Chief
Bola Ige to join his cabinet.
</P>
<P>
The party also made it clear that any party stalwart who
decided to serve the present government will be punished, the
Guardian daily reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The rejection of the government's offer to Bola Ige is coming
on the heels of AD's hierarchy contention that Bola Ige's tenure
as minister in the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP)-controlled
government, may tend to compromise the party principles except
that such offer is channelled through the party.
</P>
<P>
The National Publicity Secretary of the AD, Ambassador Yussuf
Mamman, who issued a statement in Kaduna Saturday, said, "the
attention of the AD is drawn to the decision of one of its
members, Chief Bola Ige to serve in the Obasanjo cabinet."
</P>
<P>
"The party seeks same principles to be applicable to it with a
similar invitation, as it is too early in the day to begin intra
or inter party crisis that may cause disaffection within the
ranks, and cause encouragement of defective tendencies and use of
state power to entice people to rebel against party principles,"
said Mamman.
</P>
<P>
He explained that "the AD national leadership believes that
although President Obasanjo is perceived as a stabilizing factor
in contemporary Nigerian politics, he ought to act as a senior
member of the polity, partisanship understandable but not to the
levels of reducing his statesmanship stature."
</P>
<P>
The position of the AD, however, runs counter to the spirit of
the presidential system of government which vests the chief
executive the privilege to choose his team from within and outside
his party, even co- opting non-partisan persons into government.
</P>
<P>
The AD national leadership had met on April 11, 1999 and
"decided that the national leadership of the AD reserves the right
to fully and comprehensively sanction any member who takes
appointment without recourse to the party."
</P>
<P>
"If any segment wishes to join PDP, it is at liberty to do so
and the fact that we have a Yoruba President does not mean the AD
is in power."
</P>
<P>
However, the party spokesman argued that "AD is committed to
its objective of restructuring the country, a Sovereign National
Conference and revenue allocation based on the principle of
derivation."
</P>
<P>
"The AD and its followers did not vote for Obasanjo and we will
not jettison our fundamental objectives," said Mamman.
</P>
<P>
"We appeal to our supporters to remain steadfast as the AD is
committed to providing the Obasanjo regime with credible and
construction opposition as there is no viable democracy without
opposition," he added.
</P>
<P>
However, he argued that "what distinguishes the AD from others
is its programs, discipline and cohesion."
</P>
<P>
"The national leadership of the AD will not accept to sacrifice
its moral authority," he pointed out.

<HEADLINE> Taliban Commander Killed in Samangan: Opposition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, June 6 (Xinhua) -- The Afghan Northern Alliance
Sunday claimed that its forces have killed a prominent Taliban
commander in the northern Afghan province of Samangan.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban commander, Mullah Daoud, was killed in action in
Darre Suf on Saturday, spokesman for the opposition faction
Harakat-e-Islami General Hussain Anwari said.
</P>
<P>
Daoud had led the offensive against Darre Suf and the Taliban
militia launched two specific offensives in order to retrieve his
dead body, but they failed.
</P>
<P>
Alliance commanders in the region have now agreed to hand back
the bodies of Daoud and 18 others to the Taliban in the coming
days, according to Anwari.
</P>
<P>
He said that despite almost five weeks of attacks, the Taliban
have failed in their endeavor to recapture the strategic valley.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the alliance's forces have succeeded in
recapturing territory lost during the first week of the Taliban
offensive.
</P>
<P>
To the north of Darre Suf, Safed Kotal and Kishende remain
firmly in the alliance's control. Front-lines have also been
maintained at Guldara, to the northeast, and Roo e Do Ab to the
south of Darre Suf, Anwari said.

<HEADLINE> Fewer Drug Abusers Reported in Q1 of 1999 in HK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 6 (Xinhua) -- A total of 5,527 drug abusers
were reported to Hong Kong's Central Registry of Drug Abuse (CRDA)
in the first quarter of this year, an 11 percent drop compared
with the 6,210 reported in the same quarter last year, the
government said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the number of drug abusers aged below 21 reported to
the CRDA also dropped by 23 percent from 1,033 to 794, it said in
a press release.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the drop in the number of young drug abusers,
Commissioner for Narcotics Clarie Lo said vigorous efforts in
preventive education and publicity had contributed to the falling
trend.
</P>
<P>
"Nevertheless, we are determined to sustain our efforts and
take whatever measures necessary to prevent the public, especially
youngsters, from taking drugs," Lo said.
</P>
<P>
This is specially important when there is a worldwide trend
that increasingly, drug abuse starts at a relatively tender age,
she added.
</P>
<P>
Lo said the government, together with non-governmental
organizations, will organize a series of preventive education and
publicity activities in the forthcoming "Anti-drug Season," a
campaign from June to November.
</P>
<P>
Apart from a rural concert on June 26 to mark the United
Nations International Day Against Drug Abuse and Illicit
Trafficking, there will be a drug education training camp in
August; visits to treatment and rehabilitation centers in the
summer; and an anti-drug tele-match in November 1999, according to
Lo.
</P>
<P>
In addition, there will also be a variety of other activities
organized by NGOs, the Social Welfare Department, the Education
Department, the Correctional Services Department in support of the
Anti-drug Season, Lo said.
</P>
<P>
These include workshops, lectures, various competitions,
exhibitions, day camps, carnivals and courses on substance abuse
prevention for primary school teachers, Lo added.

<HEADLINE> Backgrounder: Barak's Coalition Guidelines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 6 (Xinhua) -- Israel's Prime Minister-elect Ehud
Barak has been negotiating with various political parties over his
coalition guidelines, which serves as a foundation for coalition
talks and formation of the government.
</P>
<P>
The 11-page document includes paragraphs dedicated to a number
of issues such as the peace process, state and religion, the
economy and changing the national order of priorities.
</P>
<P>
The document is general without detailing any specific goals.
Among the document's more salient points are as follows:
</P>
<P>
-- Peace and Security: Peace agreements will be based on
Israel's national and security interests, and will be dependent
on the support of the people.
</P>
<P>
-- Palestinians: the Israeli government will accelerate the
peace process with the Palestinians to reach a final agreement,
which will be put to a referendum. The government will honor
agreements already made with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
-- Syria: the Israeli government will resume negotiations with
Syria and any peace agreement with Syria will be put to a
referendum.
</P>
<P>
-- Lebanon: the Israeli government will work to withdraw the
Israel Defense Force (IDF) from Lebanon while guaranteeing the
security of northern residents and working to reach a peace
agreement.
</P>
<P>
-- Jerusalem: it will remain in its entirely the united capital
of Israel.
</P>
<P>
-- Settlements: until a final status agreement is reached no
new settlements will be established and the status of existing
settlements will not be changed. The government will meet the
ongoing development needs of existing settlements. Except for
security needs, settlements will not be entitled to preferential
distribution of state funds. Funding will be based on
socioeconomic needs on the same grounds as the rest of the
country. A ministerial committee will examine policy towards the
settlements and review decisions of previous governments.
</P>
<P>
-- Constitution: The government will during the 15th Knesset
(parliament) complete the Basic Law and introduce a
constitution. This document will protect all sectors and the
constitution will be prepared amid an effort to reach national
consensus.
</P>
<P>
-- State and Religion: The government will produce a covenant
between secular and religious Jews. The government will attempt
as much as possible not to legislate on religious affairs. The
government will attempt to legislate in the Knesset in line with
the Supreme Court ruling on the drafting of religious students and
their exemption from serving in the army with the goodwill of all
those affected.

<HEADLINE> Barak Continues difficult Coalition Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 6 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister-elect Ehud
Barak and Likud's temporary leader Ariel Sharon are to meet
Sunday in Tel Aviv for what was described as a "crucial" meeting
for Likud's chances of joining Barak's coalition.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Barak is to present Sunday the draft of his
government's guidelines to Center Party leader Yitzhak Mordechai,
in their second private meeting since the coalition talks began
in mid-May.
</P>
<P>
Considering the understanding already reached between One
Israel headed by Barak and the Center Party regarding the
guidelines, speculation is that Barak and Mordechai will focus on
details of the coalition agreement and the Center Party's position
in Barak's cabinet.
</P>
<P>
Negotiations with Sharon is not so easy. Although Sharon has
voiced his intention to join Barak's coalition, his party has
divided on the issue and the continuing internal disputes has
hindered Sharon from making a final decision. Likud has decided to
to discuss the issue, but the date has not been set.
</P>
<P>
In general, one Israel has encountered difficulties in the
coalition talks and it was apparently hard for it to please all
parties in the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Shortly after Shabat Saturday evening, Israeli Jewish holiday,
Barak started his meetings with representatives of his potential
coalition partners, Meretz, Yisrael Baaliya, the National
Religious party (NRP) and the United Torah Judaism (UTJ).
</P>
<P>
During the meetings, which lasted till small hours Sunday,
Barak discussed with them his government's policy guidelines and
some of the clauses reportedly came under dispute.
</P>
<P>
Issues concerning settlements and Barak's intention to draft
religious students into the army were the center of the
contention.
</P>
<P>
Barak's future policies call for an end to the settlements'
preferential status but allows "natural development of
settlements."
</P>
<P>
The NRP and Yisrael Baaliya rejected outright the end of
settlements' preferred status while Meretz opposed their natural
expansion.
</P>
<P>
Meretz is insisting that the guidelines demand a "freeze" on
all investments and expansion in the occupied territories,
something other parties rejected.
</P>
<P>
UTJ has said that any agreement on the matter of drafting
religious students is a precondition to further negotiations on
the party's inclusion in the coalition.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Meretz has not changed its stance on opposing
ultra-orthodox Shas Party's entry into the coalition.
</P>
<P>
Barak intends to complete the policy negotiations by the time
the 15th Knesset (parliament) is sworn-in Monday afternoon while
hoping to piece together a coalition within 10-14 days.
</P>
<P>
The election law gives Barak 45 days to form his government
after the official announcement of the election results.

<HEADLINE> Australia Refuses to Lift Ban on Uncooked Canadian Salmon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, June 6 (Xinhua) -- Agriculture Minister Mark Vaile
said Sunday Australia stands by its long-standing decision to
refuse imports of uncooked Canadian salmon, rejecting claims that
Australia was on the verge of a trade war with Canada over the
issue.
</P>
<P>
Vaile said a scientific assessment showed uncooked Canadian
salmon posed an unacceptable risk of introducing disease to
Australian salmon stocks.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on the TV program Meet the Press by Canberra-based
Network Ten, Vaile warned that the Canadians were applying
considerable pressure over the dispute.
</P>
<P>
Australia has until July 6 to decide whether or not it will
meet a World Trade Organization (WTO) directive to allow Canadian
salmon into Australia.
</P>
<P>
"I don't say we are on the verge of a salmon war but the
Canadians are very aggressive and very assertive and their recent
announcement on possible retaliation is quite provocative as far
as this stage of the process is concerned."
</P>
<P>
Canada has already signaled it could hit back if the 24-year
restriction on salmon is not lifted.
</P>
<P>
A list of 52 primary products was published in the Canada
Gazette last week, including Australian sheep, fruit, fish and
flowers with the possibility that some or all could face a 100
percent import tax.
</P>
<P>
"We want to make very clear that we stand very firmly behind
the import risk analysis process that we run in Australia that
(the official) Australian Quarantine Inspection Service undertakes
in terms of assessing the risk that may attach to imports coming
to Australia," he said.

<HEADLINE> Structures in Zambian Capital Short of Fire Safety </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, June 6 (Xinhua) -- Thousands of structures in Zambian
capital Lusaka are facing closure due to lacking basic fire safety
facilities, according to the Sunday Mail newspaper.
</P>
<P>
The paper reported that Lusaka City Council inspections have
shown that only 300 out of over 3,000 designated premises have
fire certificates.
</P>
<P>
The council has warned that those who do not comply with
regulations will only have themselves to blame when action is
taken against them.
</P>
<P>
Among the premises facing potential fire dangers are schools,
offices and even markets, the paper noted.
</P>
<P>
Spokesman of the city council Daniel M'soka was quoted as
saying that the building industry in the southern African country
leaves much to be desired.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman attributed the non-compliance by business houses
of fire safety regulations to the poor publicity and lack of
enforcement of regulations.
</P>
<P>
He warned that the council is now determined to enforce the
fire safety regulations.
</P>
<P>
In a public notice the council warns all designated premises
such as schools, offices and factories to comply with fire safety
regulations and display fire certificates.
</P>
<P>
An officer at the City Fire Brigade described the response to
the notice as overwhelming.
</P>
<P>
"These rules have always been there. The only problem is that
they were not being enforced," he pointed out.

<HEADLINE> Lake Tanganyika Threatened With Pollution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, June 6 (Xinhua) -- The Environmental Council of Zambia
has said that the economic resources in and around Lake
Tanganyika are under threat due to pollution and over fishing by
using inappropriate methods.
</P>
<P>
Zambian newspaper Sunday Mail quoted assistant national
coordinator of the Lake Tanganyika Biodiversity Project
Munshimbwe Chitalu as saying that sewers from district councils
near the lake shores are disposed into the lake's international
waters.
</P>
<P>
"On the Zambian side, pollution to the lake occurs when
councils near the lake shores dispose sewers into the
international waters of the lake," he said.
</P>
<P>
Chitalu also noted that oil discharges from boats and ships due
to oil explorations and transportation on the lake are some of the
major forms of pollution to the lake.
</P>
<P>
"Due to oil explorations and international transportation
taking place on the lake, moving vessels also discharge some oil
deposits into the water, making it inconceivable for creatures
living in the lake waters," he said.
</P>
<P>
Chitalu said the use of wrong methods of fishing such as nets
with small holes and explosives are also a threat to the diversity
of life in the lake.
</P>
<P>
Since Lake Tanganyika is shared by four countries: Zambia,
Burundi, Tanzania and the Democratic Republic of Congo, Chitalu
said, any form of pollution taking place in any of the four
nations affects livelihood of people in all these countries.

<HEADLINE> China Plans to Use More Overseas Capital for Environment Industries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 6 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese Government plans to use
overseas investment to speed up the development of its
environmental protection industries, the Business Weekly reported
today.
</P>
<P>
A senior official with the State Environmental Protection
Administration (SEPA) told the English newspaper that introducing
more foreign capital and advanced technologies would be an
effective way for the country to accelerate the development of the
industry.
</P>
<P>
The report said that the environmental sector has so far
absorbed more than 3.3 billion U.S. dollars in foreign funds.
Foreign capital has mainly come from the World Bank, the Asian
Development Bank, United Nations Development Program, bilateral
government organizations and multi-lateral international
organizations.
</P>
<P>
"Cooperation with foreign counterparts will be one of the major
ways to lure more foreign capital in the coming years," said Song
Ruixiang, deputy director of SEPA. "The cooperation will also
contribute to upgrading China's relatively backward technology in
the sector."
</P>
<P>
China's environmental protection industry mainly focuses on the
production of environmental protection machinery, treatment and
recycling of solid waste, and curbing water and air pollution. But
due to outdated technologies, a large proportion of the country's
key environmental protection equipment comes from imports.
</P>
<P>
The report said that the priority in China's environmental
protection for the next few years would go to four areas:
development of urban sewage treatment systems; equipment to curb
air pollution; solid waste disposal; and equipment to monitor the
environment.
</P>
<P>
China plans to introduce 4 billion dollars into environmental
protection during the Ninth Five-year Plan (1996-2000), according
to the report.

<HEADLINE> Bangladeshi Govt Allows No More of Polythene Factories </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, June 6 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladeshi government has said
it will no longer permit any initiative to set up new polythene
factories, and plans to phase out the use of the environmentally
hazardous product, the Financial Express newspaper reported
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
At a discussion here to mark World Environment Day on Saturday,
Environment and Forest Minister Syeda Sajeda Chowdhury reiterated
the government's commitment to check environmental pollution,
saying it has decided not to allow the setting up of new heavy
industries without "effluent treatment plants."
</P>
<P>
The cabinet had already made a decision for checking violation
of environmental laws, she said, adding that on completion of
necessary legal formalities, the environmental courts "would soon
start functioning" in all the country's six divisional
headquarters.
</P>
<P>
She expressed grave concern over the increasing noise pollution
in big cities, and made it clear that areas in the proximity of
schools and hospitals would be declared as "silent zones."
</P>
<P>
On the government's efforts in checking pollution, she said
that hunting of guest birds had already been banned for five years
for the conservation of wild animals and bio-diversity, and a big
project "Sundarbans Bio-Diversity project" aided by the Asian
Development Bank has also been launched.
</P>
<P>
The "Sustainable Environment Management Project" at a cost of
1.19 billion taka (24.5 million U.S. dollars) has been taken up
with the assistance of various institutions and organizations, as
the government has given top priority to environment-related
planning and programs under Action-21, she added.
</P>
<P>
A World Bank-aided "Air Quality Monitoring Project" at a cost
of about 300 million taka (6.2 million dollars) will be
commissioned next July to check emission of black-smoke by
automobiles in Dhaka, she said.

<HEADLINE> Bangladeshi Parliament Starts Budget Session </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, June 6 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh's Jatiya Sangsad, or
parliament, started its budget session on Sunday, with Law-makers
from both the ruling Awami League and the opposition parties
attending the inaugural session.
</P>
<P>
Finance Minister Shah A.S.M. Kibria is expected to place the
national budget for the 1999-2000 fiscal year before the house
next Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The duration of the current session will be decided at a
meeting of the Business Advisory Committee later in the day.
</P>
<P>
The session, which is likely to be lengthy one with general
discussion on the budget taking the major share of the time, will
witness stormy debates as the ruling Awami League and the
opposition parties have plans to utilize the session keeping in
mind the next general elections slated for the year 2001, media
reports said.
</P>
<P>
"The party high command has already asked the finance minister
to formulate the budget keeping in mind the next general
elections," a ruling party stalwart was quoted by the Daily Star
newspaper as saying.
</P>
<P>
The opposition parties, including the major opposition
Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), the Jatiya Party and others,
have reached an understanding to make concerted efforts to project
the government's failures in such sectors as power, gas, law and
order situation, trade and commerce, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
A BNP leader was quoted as saying that "whatever we do in the
house, we will naturally keep an eye on the next national polls."
</P>
<P>
Besides passing the budget, the session will transact a good
number of legislative businesses, including the consideration of
the upazilla (sub-district) amendment bill seeking provision for
deferring the upazilla elections, and the ruling Awami League's
efforts to renew a constitution amendment which stipulates 30
reserved parliamentary seats for women.
</P>
<P>
The Parliament Secretariat has received over 90 questions
addressed to the prime minister for her reply during the prime
minister's question-answer session for half an hour scheduled for
Tuesday, and nearly 1,900 questions on the activities of different
ministries.

<HEADLINE> Major Political Events in Indonesia's Since 1945 (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, June 6 (Xinhua) -- After a year full of trouble,
Indonesia has arrived at the moment of truth: the 1999 General
Election. At 08:00 a.m. local time (0100 GMT) on June 7, millions
of Indonesians will cast their votes in what many analysts
consider to be "the most free and democratic election since 1955."
</P>
<P>
The following is a glimpse of major political events in
Indonesia since 1945:
</P>
<P>
August 17, 1945
</P>
<P>
-- Independence Day and the birth of the nation now known as
Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
August 18, 1945
</P>
<P>
-- The birth of the constitution, known by all Indonesians as
the 1945 Constitution. Although it is considered the most solid
constitution for Indonesia so far, there were also loopholes which
can be manipulated by those in power for their own advantage, e.g.
there is no limit on the number of presidential terms.
</P>
<P>
In its preamble, it is stated that Indonesia shall be based
upon the five philosophical principles, Pancasila. They are:
belief in the One and Only God, just and civilized humanity, the
unity of Indonesia, democracy guided by the inner wisdom of
deliberations of representatives, and social justice for all the
Indonesian people.
</P>
<P>
August 17, 1949
</P>
<P>
-- Holland, the former colonial ruler of Indonesia, finally
acknowledges Indonesia's independence. However, it wasn't as
simple as that, as they left a time bomb ticking for the new
republic when they made Indonesia a federal state, rather than the
single unitary state as stipulated in the constitution.
</P>
<P>
1950
</P>
<P>
-- Indonesia finally rejected any further control by a foreign
power and decided to scrap the Federal system and return to a
unitary state. The republic used a liberal democracy as its basic
system.
</P>
<P>
1950-1960
</P>
<P>
-- Though it was never clear when and how, many provinces in
Indonesia were beginning to be fed up with the centralist
government, and the way the wealth of the nation seemed to wind up
back in Jakarta. Many provinces, Maluku for example, decided to
turn rebellious. With a firm hand, and many promises for a better
deal for the provinces from the central government, the rebellions
were finally put down. It provides Indonesia with a very bitter
lesson. With more than 300 ethnic groups and 17,000 islands, the
seeds for disintegration were there.
</P>
<P>
1955
</P>
<P>
-- The first election. Then as now, that election was also
dubbed "the most democratic election." The election resulted in
the four biggest parties -- the Indonesian Nationalist Party
(PNI), the traditional Islamic party Nahdlatul Ulama (NU), the
Indonesian Communist Party (PKI) and the Indonesian Muslim Council
(Masyumi) -- each garnering between 16 percent to 22 percent of
the votes.
</P>
<P>
Despite the idealism, the election failed to solve the
political problems encountered under a liberal democratic system.

<TEXT>
<P>
1959
</P>
<P>
-- Totally fed up with the parliamentary (liberal) system which
lasted for a decade and seemed to be going nowhere, then president
Soekarno finally issued a presidential decree to return the
governmental system to a full presidential system, and make the
1945 constitution the national constitution.
</P>
<P>
A few years after the decree, Soekarno himself broke the
constitution by making himself the life-long president of
Indonesia. The president was required to be elected every five
years.
</P>
<P>
1966
</P>
<P>
-- President Soekarno stepped down. Regional "confrontation" in
the form of conflicts with Malaysia and Singapore, wars that were
never declared, also ceased. The year also marked the rise of a
new ruler Soeharto and his new administration, the start of the
"New Order" era.
</P>
<P>
1971
</P>
<P>
-- The first election after 1955 and contested by 10 political
parties. Golkar (Functional Group), with the full support of the
government, won the election. Later the number of parties were
reduced to two plus Golkar.
</P>
<P>
Golkar continued to win every election during the Soeharto era.
Critics claim Golkar won by using a combination of promises, money
politics, intimidation and outright cheating. In 1997 Golkar won
its last election, typically a "landslide" victory.
</P>
<P>
1998
</P>
<P>
-- After a year of living through the worse economic crisis in
32 years, President Soeharto abruptly ended his tenure following
the dramatic shooting that killed six Trisakti University
students. The shooting also triggered massive riots, bringing
Jakarta into total chaos. Former Vice President B.J. Habibie took
over as president.
</P>
<P>
1999
</P>
<P>
-- After a rigorous process, 48 political parties have been
finally declared eligible to take part in the June 7 election.
While the campaign had been widely predicted to be a bloody one,
it actually went much smoother than predicted.
</P>
<P>
Whether it is a democracy which is fair, based on the rule of
law and justice for all will remain a question to be answered by
all those Indonesians who will go to the polls on June 7.

<HEADLINE> Philippines Provides Easy Credit to Cooperatives </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 6 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government has
stepped up efforts to provide easy credit to cooperatives
nationwide in order to speed up the country's economic recovery,
said a state bank official Sunday.
</P>
<P>
In a report released here, Florido Casuela, president of the
state-run Land Bank of the Philippines (LBP), said his bank last
year released 1.32 billion pesos (34.7 million U.S. dollars) in
credit assistance to cooperatives based in Metro Manila alone, a
28 percent increase over the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Casuela said the total number of cooperatives that availed of
these loans grew from 107 to 122 last year, covering 17 cities and
municipalities in Metro Manila.
</P>
<P>
"These cooperatives are composed of employees credit
cooperatives, transport service, market/meat vendors, credit
cooperatives and parish-based livelihood multi-purpose
cooperatives," he said.
</P>
<P>
According to Casuela, the loans were used to finance their
livelihood projects, including rice trading, operation of machine
shops, taxi business and grocery, purchase of transport vehicles
and construction of commercial and multi-purpose building.
</P>
<P>
He also said that the government's credit support to farmer
beneficiaries of the Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Program and
other rural folks has increased five-fold to 12.3 billion pesos
(320 million dollars) in 1998.

<HEADLINE> Knicks Edge Pacers 92-91 in NBA Playoffs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 5 (Xinhua) -- Trailing by three points with
time running out, the New York Knicks appeared to have very little
chance of forcing overtime against the Indiana Pacers. But Larry
Johnson made sure they didn't.
</P>
<P>
Johnson's incredible four-point play with 5.7 seconds left gave
the Knicks a stunning 92-91 victory over the Pacers and a 2-1 lead
in the Eastern Conference finals.
</P>
<P>
Playing without star center Patrick Ewing, the Knicks trailed
91-88 after Indiana's Mark Jackson made two free throws with 11.6
seconds to go and needed a miracle. Johnson provided one.
</P>
<P>
The in-bounds pass was deflected but corralled by Johnson at
the left wing. Guarded by Antonio Davis, Johnson faked and drew
slight body contact before launching his third 3-pointer as
referee Jess Kersey called a foul.
</P>
<P>
"I was squared," Johnson said. "I wasn't leaning. The Foul was
not like an off-balance foul. I was so shocked at that. But I
thought I released it pretty good."
</P>
<P>
Johnson briefly celebrated but settled down and calmly sank the
free throw for perhaps the greatest four-point play in NBA history.
</P>
<P>
The Knicks already had upset top-seeded Miami and fourth-seeded
Atlanta to become the first No. 8 seed to reach the conference
finals. New York surprised second-seeded Indiana in Game 1, but a
loss in Game 2, followed by Ewing's season-ending Achilles tendon
tear, appeared to signify an end to New York's postseason party.
</P>
<P>
But Johnson kept things going, scoring a playoff career-high 26
points. He scored 11 points in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
It was a crushing loss for the Pacers, who appeared to have the
upper hand when Ewing went down but now are facing a virtual must-
win scenario in Game 4 on Monday night at New York. Indiana
suffered its first loss in four road postseason games.
</P>
<P>
These rivals are meeting in the playoffs for the fourth time in
the last six years.
</P>
<P>
Marcus Camby contributed 21 points, 11 rebounds and four steals
for the Knicks. Allan Houston added 15 points and Latrell Sprewell
got 14. The Knicks shot 44 percent (38-of-86) and held a 40-31
rebounding edge.
</P>
<P>
Rik Smits scored 25 points to lead the Pacers, which shot 48
percent and made 22-of 25 free throws. Reggie Miller got 12 points.

Some of the Cuban fighters were not as good as one had expected,
Fontanial said.
</P>
<P>
He mentioned welterweight World Cup gold medallist Juan
Hernandez, saying if he continues to fight like he did Saturday,
Thailand's Parpoom Chaengphonak can easily beat him.
</P>
<P>
Fontanial had earlier predicted that Cuba and Uzbekistan are
the two most favorite teams to win the trophy.
</P>
<P>
Also in Saturday's matches, the Thai team A beat their rivals
from the United States by an identical fashion as the Cubans,
while the Thai team B also did a fine job against the Bulgaria by
winning four out of seven bouts.
</P>
<P>
In the next tie, the Thai team A will take on Uzbekistan, which
is tough to beat. But Fontanial is confident that the Thai
fighters can pull it off.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka Seizes More Drugs in Crackdown Drive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, June 6 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka's Police Narcotics Bureau
(PNB) has seized over 9.5 kilograms of heroin worth about 30
million rupees (430,000 U.S. dollars) in a recent raid, police
sources said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
This is the biggest seizure this year and is believed to be
part of a larger haul that had been brought into the country, the
sources said.
</P>
<P>
The PNB also arrested two people traveling in a van with the
heroin concealed in a bag in a south suburb of Colombo during the
raid on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The two suspects were detained under the Emergency Regulations,
pending completion of the ongoing investigations, the sources
said.
</P>
<P>
The PNB has detected four more cases involving more than one
kilogram of heroin early this year.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lankan President Chandrika Kumaratunga has directed the
police to take stringent measures to wipe out the drug menace in
the country.
</P>
<P>
Investigations revealed that the heroin had been smuggled into
the country by sea from south India.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. International Narcotics Control Strategy Report
describes India as a major producer of narcotics for international
narcotics trafficking.
</P>
<P>
The sources said 10 billion rupees worth of narcotics have been
smuggled into Sri Lanka by sea last year.
</P>
<P>
The PNB's annual report says that smugglers use mechanized
fishing craft to smuggle narcotics from the south Indian ports and
unload on the northwestern and western coasts of Sri Lanka.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka has been viewed a major transit point for heroin to
be shipped to Europe and other Western destinations due to its
close geographical proximity to the "Golden Triangle" and the
"Golden Crescent" where major poppy growing areas are located.

<HEADLINE> Colombia to Extend Demilitarized Zone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, June 5 (Xinhua) -- The Colombian government
Saturday announced the decision to extend until December 7 the
duration of its demilitarized zone in the south of the country,
established for negotiations with guerrillas of the Revolutionary
Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC).
</P>
<P>
The 42,000 square kilometer demilitarized zone in the Meta and
Caqueta departments, created November 7 last year and intended to
last three months, was extended three more months in February and
one more in May, which would last until June 7.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, President Andres Pastrana appointed a commission
in charge of negotiating with the FARC. It was made up of Congress
President Fabio Valencia; president's private secretary Camilo
Gomes; political advisor Juan Gabriel Uribe; businessman Pedro
Gomez Barrero; and General Gonzalo Forero Delgadillo, retired,
also ex-commander of the military forces.
</P>
<P>
The five government representatives will talk with their
counterparts including FARC leaders Raul Reyes, Joaquin Gomez, and
Fabian Ramirez.
</P>
<P>
Sources here said the extension of the demilitarized zone and
the appointment of negotiators showed the determination of the
government to achieve peace through talks with the FARC in order
to end the three-decade-long civil war in Colombia.

the guerrilla war.
</P>
<P>
The repatriation is supervised by authorities of both countries,

<HEADLINE> China's Exports to EU Declines 2.1 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 6 (Xinhua) -- China's exports to the European
Union (EU) have suffered a 2.1 percent drop in the first four
months of this year, in stark contrast to their 18.1 percent surge
for the last year as a whole, the business Weekly reported today.
</P>
<P>
The decline was blamed as a result of the fall in the value of
Euro, fierce competition, rising protectionism and the slow-down
of the EU economy, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
"The fall in the value of the euro against the U.S. dollar has
put heavy pressure on China's exports targeted at the EU market,"
the paper quoted Sun Zhengyu, vice-minister of the Ministry of
Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation (MOFTEC), as saying. "It is
also likely to raise the difficulties and uncertainties in China's
foreign investment absorption drive."
</P>
<P>
As the Chinese currency has been standing strong against the U.
S. dollar, the weakening of the euro has deprived Chinese
exporters of their price advantages and hurt their ability to
compete for the EU market.
</P>
<P>
By the end of April, the euro had lost 10 percent of its value
against the dollar since its launch in January.
</P>
<P>
In addition, its introduction has helped southern European
countries, which have similar economic structures to China, to
expand their business within the EU market, severely damaging
Chinese competitors.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, as the crisis-hit economies in the Asian area begin
to bottom out, the competitive edges of their export products are
sharpening significantly.
</P>
<P>
Trade protectionism in the EU has also grown recently, further
frustrating the Chinese exporters' efforts to expand sales to the
EU. According to MOFTEC, the European Union has launched four new
anti-dumping cases against Chinese exporters recently.
</P>
<P>
Li Huiying, a researcher from the Chinese Academy of
International Trade and Economic Cooperation held that the basic
reason for the decline in China's exports was the lukewarm
development of the EU economy.
</P>
<P>
"The EU's economic growth rate has slowed down since the second
half of last year, and this has pinched its demand for imports,"
Li said.

<HEADLINE> Facts and Figures About Indonesia (2) - Upcoming Election </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, June 6 (Xinhua) -- The general elections will be held
in Indonesia on Monday. The following are facts and figures about
Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia, the fourth most populous nation in the world, will
hold general elections (parliamentary elections) on June 7, 1999,
described as the most democratic multi-party elections in 30
years.
</P>
<P>
The forthcoming election will be the eighth one since Indonesia
gained independence in 1945 and the seventh since the New Order
government ruled by former president Soeharto who stepped down in
May last year amid the country's worst political and economic
crisis.
</P>
<P>
The country's 127.6 million eligible voters will elect 462
members to the 500-seat House of Representatives (DPR). The
remaining 38 seats are reserved for the Armed Forces which do not
vote.
</P>
<P>
Voting begins at 8:00 a.m. local time (0100 GMT) and ends at
2:00 p.m. (0700 GMT).
</P>
<P>
The General Election Commission (KPU) has announced a permanent
list of 11,583 legislative candidates put forward by all
contesting parties. The figure does not include 38 military
representatives in the DPR.
</P>
<P>
Approximately 320,000 polling stations will be used for the
election. The tabulation of the votes will be accomplished first
at each polling station. A copy of the results will be given to
party representatives and accredited monitoring organizations and
posted at each polling place.
</P>
<P>
The results from the polling stations are then consolidated at
approximately 67,000 villages. The village consolidations and
copies of polling station results are sent to approximately 4,000
sub-districts for additional consolidation and transmission to 314
districts and then to 27 provincial offices for final
consolidation. This process takes several days.
</P>
<P>
KPU officials have said the preliminary results of the election
could be announced on June 9 if things go smoothly. Final district
assembly results should be released on June 28, final provincial
assembly results on July 1 and final official parliament results
on July 6.
</P>
<P>
The upcoming general elections will be different from the
previous ones, with as many as 48 political parties contesting. In
the past 30 years, only three parties were allowed to contest.
There are now a total of 148 political parties in Indonesia.

<HEADLINE> Facts and Figures About Indonesia (3) - Legislature and Presidential Election </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, June 6 (Xinhua) -- The general elections will be held
in Indonesia on Monday. The following are facts and figures about
Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
The General Session of the People's Consultative Assembly
(Majelis Permusyawaratan Rakyat or MPR), Indonesia's highest
legislative body, decided in November 1998 to hold general
elections on June 1999. At the end of this year, the newly-elected
MPR will elect a new president and vice president for 1999/2004.
</P>
<P>
Sovereignty is in the hands of the people and is exercised in
full by the MPR as the embodiment of the whole Indonesian people.
The People's Consultative Assembly is to be distinguished from the
legislative body proper -- Dewan Perwakilan Rakyat (House of
Representatives or DPR) which is incorporated in the MPR.
</P>
<P>
In the upcoming general elections, the MPR will have 700
members who serve for five years, including 500 members from the
DPR and 200 presidential appointees (135 from regional
representatives and 65 from functional representatives).
</P>
<P>
The MPR is required to meet once every 5 years, and its duties
include electing the president and vice president, amending the
Constitution and approving the broad policy aims of the
government.
</P>
<P>
The 500-member DPR exercises legislative authority. In the
coming election, 462 members will be directly elected, and the
remaining 38 seats will be reserved for the Armed Forces which do
not vote.
</P>
<P>
The DPR meets at least once a year. All laws must have the
approval of the DPR, but the president has an absolute veto.
Members of the DPR have the right to submit draft bills which
require ratification by the president. The president may enact
ordinances during times of emergency, which however must be either
ratified or revoked by the DPR during its following session.
</P>
<P>
All political parties contesting the election are allowed to
and have put forward their presidential candidates to the MPR's
five-yearly General Session, which is scheduled for November this
year. According to electoral rules, a candidate could be elected
by getting more than half votes from the 700-member MPR.
</P>
<P>
From 1967 to 1997, former president Soeharto had been elected
for six times running since there was only one presidential
candidate. Incumbent President B.J. Habibie has been nominated by
the ruling Golkar Party as its presidential candidate for
1999/2004.

<HEADLINE> Facts and Figures About Indonesia (4) - Key Political Parties (Part One) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, June 6 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia will hold a multi-party
general election on June 7, in which 48 out of more than 140
political parties in the country will be contesting.
</P>
<P>
The following are the introduction of several major parties
with the best chance to win in the polls:
</P>
<P>
-- The United Development Party (PPP).
</P>
<P>
As one of the only three political parties allowed to contest
the general elections in the past 30 years when former president
Soeharto was in power, PPP has returned to its founding principle
of Islam since the advent of the present reform era. This is
marked by the use again of the Kabah (the small cubicle shrine in
the Great Mosque of Mecca which contains the famous Black Stone of
Mecca) as its party symbol.
</P>
<P>
The party was set up in 1973 as a fusion of four Islamic
parties -- the Nahdlatul Ulama Party, the Indonesian Muslimin
Party, Partai Syarikat Islam Indonesia and Perti Islam Party. Most
of the party's constituents are Ulema (Muslim scholars) and
students of Pesantren (Islamic boarding school) in the rural
areas, mainly in Java.
</P>
<P>
There is no official information about the size of the party's
membership.
</P>
<P>
The PPP has been weakened since many members of the Nahdlatul
Ulama Party, the country's largest Muslim organization, withdrew
from it in 1998. Obviously, the existence of other Islamic parties
as participants of the 1999 general election, constitutes a
competition in obtaining votes. More over, several prominent
figures of those Islamic parties used to be well-known figures of
PPP.
</P>
<P>
The firm stance that PPP showed in the 1998 extraordinary
session of the People's Consultative Assembly (MPR) is viewed as
one of the factors that have increased the party's popularity. At
the session, PPP urged the MPR to abolish the political function
of the Armed Forces by dismissing military membership in the
parliament and pushing forward the investigation into the wealth
of former president Soeharto.
</P>
<P>
In its program, PPP has decided that in the future it will
continue to fight for a democratic national life by putting in
proper place the functions of the Armed Forces, the House of
Representatives (DPR), the president and other state institutions.
With an Islam base, PPP wants to fight for a democratic political
order based on Akhlakul Karimah (generous morals) and develop an
Islamic life.
</P>
<P>
-- The Golkar Party.
</P>
<P>
The Golkar Party is the continuation of the ruling Golongan
Karya (Golkar, Functional Group), which since the establishment of
the New Order administration in 1967, has been dominating the
legislative body.
</P>
<P>
The Golkar, set up by a group of military and civilian leaders
in 1966, claims a membership of 36 million out of a population of
207 million in the country.
</P>
<P>
The Golkar, which has won the last six elections, won more than
74 percent of the votes in the general election held in May 1997
as it enjoyed full backing from the military, government
bureaucracy and leading businessmen.
</P>
<P>
However, the Golkar has split since former president Soeharto
stepped down last year and some leading members have formed their
own parties.
</P>
<P>
Faced with the new situation, Golkar has repositioned itself.
Through the Special National Consensus in July 1997, Golkar has
produced a new paradigm. This was shown in the existence of a more
democratic process of the election of its chairman, and the
abolition of the Supervisory Board Institution and the three ABG
(Armed Forces, Bureaucrats and Golkar) lines. Besides, Golkar has
also admitted and apologized for its past mistakes.
</P>
<P>
The Golkar was officially declared a political party in March
this year. Golkar says it observes the necessity of developing the
people's economy which has a strong potential to strengthen
fundamentally the nation's economy.

<HEADLINE> Facts and Figures About Indonesia (4) - Key Political Parties (Part Two) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
-- The Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle (PDI
Perjuangan).
</P>
<P>
PDI Perjuangan was born out of a protracted dispute within the
Indonesian Democratic Party (PDI), an alliance of several
Christian and nationalist parties set up in 1973. At the
government-backed PDI Congress on June 20-21, 1996 in Medan, North
Sumatera, several members of the PDI leadership openly ignored the
leadership which at that moment was held by Megawati
Soekarnoputri, the eldest daughter of late founding president
Soekarno. The move led to riots in Jakarta later that year.
</P>
<P>
This situation forced most of the PDI supporters to organize a
congress in Bali in October 1998 to declare their own existence,
separate from the PDI led by Budi Hardjono. The PDI group led by
Megawati as a result of the Bali Congress finally agreed to add
the word "Perjuangan" (Struggle) after the word PDI to
differentiate it from the other PDI group.
</P>
<P>
As was committed at Congress V in Bali, the party, determined
to win the 1999 general election, appointed Megawati as the
presidential candidate at the General Session of the People's
Consultative Assembly in 1999. One of the party's proclaimed aims
is to continue to defend the form of a unitary state, as was
aspired previously.
</P>
<P>
-- The National Mandate Party (PAN).
</P>
<P>
The establishment of the party was brought about by the
People's Mandate Council (Mara), one of the reform movement organs
during the era of Soeharto's administration.
</P>
<P>
Mara was declared on May 14, 1998 in Jakarta by 50 prominent
national figures including Prof. Dr. H. Amien Rais, former general
chairperson of Muhammadiyah, the second largest Muslim
organization in the country.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting held on August 5-6, 1998 in Bogor, West Java, they
agreed to form the Partai Amanat Bangsa, which later became the
PAN.
</P>
<P>
PAN has the aim to respect and maintain the people's
sovereignty, justice, material and spiritual progress. The party's
aspirations are rooted in religious morals, humanity and
plurality.
</P>
<P>
Besides, PAN also adheres to the non-sectarian and
non-discriminative principle. To create a new Indonesia, PAN has
the courage to bring up the idea of a dialogue on the form of a
federal republic state as an answer to the threat of
disintegration. The central point of the dialogue is the fairness
in the management of resources so that people can truly feel
themselves as members of the nation.
</P>
<P>
-- The National Awakening Party (PKB).
</P>
<P>
The PKB emerged as a response to the proposal of members of
Nahdlatul Ulama (NU) of all corners of the country who want the
presence of a container which could accommodate the political
aspirations of the NU community. The Board of Management of NU
later served as midwife at the birth of PKB.
</P>
<P>
The PKB was born through an intensive process of assessments.
The PKB is a "part of the NU people," and at the same time also
became a party with the characteristics of nationalism and
democracy, open to whoever, in the sense of cross religion,
ethnic, race and class.
</P>
<P>
The PKB, which is fully supported by KH. Abdurrahman Wahid,
popularly known as Gus Dur, general chairman of Indonesia's
largest Muslim organization NU with around 35 million members. At
present, PKB is striving towards the restoration of people's
sovereignty, justice and unity.

JAKARTA, June 6 (Xinhua) -- The general elections will be held
in Indonesia on Monday. The following are facts and figures about
Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
In the 14th century, a Hindu kingdom of Majapahit was
established on the islands of Indonesia and had its capital in
eastern Java. The Portuguese arrived in the 16th century and set
up trading posts. Beginning in 1602, the Dutch slowly established
themselves as rulers of all the islands comprising present-day
Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
Nationalist opposition to colonial rule began in the early 20th
century. During the Second World War the territory was occupied by
Japanese forces starting from March 1942. On August 17, 1945,
three days after the Japanese surrender, a group of nationalists
proclaimed the independence of Indonesia from the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
The first president of the self-proclaimed republic was Dr.
Soekarno, a leader of the nationalist movement since the 1920s.
After four years of intermittent warfare and negotiations between
the Dutch authorities and the nationalists, an agreement was
reached on a formal transfer of power. On December 27, 1949 the
United States of Indonesia became legally independent, with Dr.
Soekarno continuing as president.
</P>
<P>
In August 1950, the federation was dissolved and the country
became the unitary Republic of Indonesia. Under President
Soekarno's rule, Indonesia played a leading role in the
Non-Aligned Movement. But inflation and widespread corruption
provoked opposition to his rule. In September 1965, there was an
abortive military coup and in March 1966 President Soekarno was
forced to transfer executive powers to Gen. Soeharto, chief of
staff of the army.
</P>
<P>
In March 1967, the People's Consultative Assembly removed
Soekarno from office and named Gen. Soeharto as acting president.
Soeharto became prime minister in October 1967 and after his
election by the assembly, he was inaugurated as president in March
1968. He was re-elected in 1973, 1978, 1983 and 1988 until May of
1998, when Bacharuddin Jusuf Habibie succeeded him as president.

<HEADLINE> Profile: Habibie - Ruling Golkar's Presidential Candidate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, June 6 (Xinhua) -- Bacharuddin Jusuf Habibie, the
incumbent president of Indonesia, is the sole presidential
candidate for the 1999/2004 term of the ruling Golkar Party which
is a major party contesting in the parliamentary elections
scheduled for June 7.
</P>
<P>
Born in the remote village of Nepo, Parepare, South Sulawesi,
on June 25, 1936, Habibie was brought up in a strictly religious
Muslim family.
</P>
<P>
Habibie is the third of four children. He began reading
newspapers when he was a child. His lifelong religious devotion
continues in adulthood.
</P>
<P>
His father, Jali Habibie from the South Sulawesi town of
Gorontalo, died when Habibie was 13 years old. Then his Javanese
mother brought her children to Bandung, West Java.
</P>
<P>
After attending the Bandung Institute of Technology for about a
year in 1954, Habibie won a scholarship from the Ministry of
Education and Culture to study aircraft construction engineering
in Aachen, West Germany, a course he completed in 1960.
</P>
<P>
As a research assistant at Aachen's Technische Hocheschule
(1960-65), Habibie created a design of deep sea submarine and a
high-pressured and temperature room for Julich Atomic Center.
</P>
<P>
In 1974, President Soeharto called Habibie home and assigned
him to be his technological consultant. He was state minister of
research and technology from 1978 to March 1998.
</P>
<P>
The strengths of Habibie, who was elected as vice president on
March 11 last year at the general session of the People's
Consultative Assembly, include his popularity among the majority
Muslim community, the esteem he holds among youths and his long
service as state minister.
</P>
<P>
B.J. Habibie was sworn in as president on May 21, 1998 after
Soeharto resigned amid the country's worst political and economic
crisis.
</P>
<P>
In the last one year since he assumed the presidential office,
Habibie and his government have launched several political and
economic reforms including the release of political prisoners,
press freedom and the holding of a multi-party election to push
forward the political and economic democracy process in the
country.

<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, June 6 (Xinhua) -- Abdurrahman Wahid is the general
chairman of Nahdlatul Ulama (NU), the largest Muslim organization
in Indonesia with around 30 million members.
</P>
<P>
He has been nominated by the National Awakening Party as the
presidential candidate to contest the presidential election.
</P>
<P>
Born in Jombang, East Java, on August 4 1940, Abdurrahman
Wahid, affectionately known Gus Dur, is the eldest of six
brothers. His farther A. Wahid Hasyim was a religion minister.
Abdurrahman Wahid studied at a number of Pesantren, or traditional
Islamic boarding schools in Java before undertaking tertiary level
studies at the Al-Azhar Islamic University in Cairo, Egypt in
1964. From Al-Azhar he went on to further studies in the field of
literature at the University of Baghdad in Iraq in 1966, and
returned to Indonesia in 1970.
</P>
<P>
From 1972 to 1974, he was dean of the Faculty of Theology
(Ushuludin) at the Hasjim Asyari University in Jombang. From 1974
to 1980, he was secretary-general of the Tebuireng Pesantren in
Jombang. In 1978, he took up the leadership of Pesantren Ciganjur
in South Jakarta. Having moved to Jakarta in 1978, Abdurrahman
Wahid became increasingly involved with the national leadership of
NU. He was made first secretary (Katib Awal) of the NU Supreme
Religious Council (Syuriyah) in 1979 in Jakarta.
</P>
<P>
In December 1984, at a five-yearly National Congress meeting of
NU, Abdurrahman Wahid was elected NU general chairman. In 1989 and
1994, he was re-elected NU general chairman and he holds the post
till now.
</P>
<P>
In the early years of his chairmanship of NU, the government
welcomed Abdurrahman Wahid's presence as a voice for moderation
and stability. In recent years, however, he has increasingly been
seen as an opposition figure after he, together with some leading
public intellectuals, launched the ginger group "Forum Demokrasi"
(Democratic Forum) to campaign for democratic reform. His public
criticism of former president Soeharto resulted in him being
placed under considerable political pressure.
</P>
<P>
Abdurrahman Wahid upholds Islamic education and national
reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
He was married with Nuriyah in 1968 and has four children.

Indonesian Democratic Party (PDI) to obtain votes in the 1987
general election. In 1993, she was elected general chairman of the
PDI.
</P>
<P>
However, Megawati was ousted from the PDI leadership by a
government-backed group in 1996 at a congress held in Medan, North
Sumatera. The move led to riots in Jakarta later that year and
helped secure her position as a leading proponent of reform.
</P>
<P>
In October 1998, Megawati was elected general chairman of the
Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle when most PDI members
separated from the government-backed PDI led by Budi Hardjono.
</P>
<P>

country and been nominated by her party as the presidential
candidate for the 1999/2004 period.

<HEADLINE> China's Vessel Exports Expected to Fall </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 6 (Xinhua) -- Chinese exports of vessels will
fall this year, industry insiders predicted.
</P>
<P>
Orders for new vessels worldwide will drop around 20 percent to
35 million tons this year from 1998, according to today's Business
Weekly,.
</P>
<P>
Chinese shipyards ordered up to 2.85 million tons by the end of
February this year.
</P>
<P>
Although production by China's shipbuilding industry expanded
rapidly after 1990 when the international market boomed, the
sector's technology and management was not upgraded
correspondingly. Meanwhile, the labor costs, production costs are
generally higher than those in Japan and Republic of Korea.
</P>
<P>
China still ranked third worldwide among ship exporters, after
Japan and Republic of Korea. Vessels worth 1.73 billion U.S.
dollars were exported last year, up seven percent from 1997,
ranking first among China's machinery exports.
</P>
<P>
However, most of the exports were ordered in 1996 and 1997.
</P>
<P>
Most of the exported vessels last year were small and with low
technology content and low added-value. About 91 percent of them
were speedboats, rowboats and light boats for entertainment and
sports purposes.
</P>
<P>
Exports of high-tech and high added-vale vessels accounted for
less than five percent of the total exports.

<HEADLINE> French Veto on Mercosur-EU Talks Worries Brazil </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRASILIA, June 5 (Xinhua) -- Brazilian Foreign Minister Luiz
Felipe Lampreia said the French veto of immediate negotiations
with the Southern Common Market (Mercosur) was a "terrifying
surprise."
</P>
<P>
French President Jacques Chirac vetoed Friday at the EU Summit
in Cologne, Germany article 89 of the resolution about the start
of the EU talks with Mercosur.
</P>
<P>
The negotiations aim to form a free trade area between the two
blocks. France advocates negotiating the free trade of its
agricultural products with Mercosur starting the year 2003.
</P>
<P>
Mercosur, founded in march 1991, is made up of Argentina,
Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay.
</P>
<P>
The Brazilian Foreign Minister told the newspaper "Folha de Sao
Paulo" that the decision still can be reverted when the European
Union foreign ministers meet on June 21.
</P>
<P>
Lampreia said the matter grows more complicated because the
hindrance came up at the level of chiefs of state."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, U.S. special trade negotiator Peter Scher said in
Brazil Friday before leaving for Washington at the end of his tour
of the Mercosur countries that the French veto helps the creation
of the Free Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA) by the year 2005.
</P>
<P>
He explained that the U.S. government will use the French veto
as an additional argument to have the Congress of his country
approve the "fast track" to negotiate the establishment of the
FTAA.
</P>
<P>
It will also help attract the Mercosur countries to the side of
the United States, in the disputes his country has with Europe in
the World Trade Organization (WTO), he said.
</P>
<P>
Scher, who was reported to be satisfied with the results of his
tour of the Mercosur countries, said there are more agreement than
disagreement between the United States and Mercosur.
</P>
<P>
The Free Trade Area of the Americas will not come into effect
before 2005. The United States and Canada, however, are urging a
preliminary reduction of tariffs on electronic and computer
products, Lampreia said.

<HEADLINE> Canadian Troops to Arrive Earlier in Macedonia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, June 5 (Xinhua) -- Canadian peace-keeping troops will
start arriving in the Balkans this week, earlier than originally
scheduled, a senior defense official said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The peace deal agreed by Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic
last week prompted Canada to send the troops overseas sooner than
anticipated, said Ray Henault, deputy chief of defense staff.
</P>
<P>
"We are now reacting to that situation and moving people a
little more quickly," Henault said.
</P>
<P>
Canadian defense officials had said the last flight of troops
would leave Edmonton on June 19.
</P>
<P>
However, the remainder of Canada's troops, mostly from the lord
Strathcona's Horse (Royal Canadian) of Edmonton, will begin
leaving as early as Monday.
</P>
<P>
They will join about 200 members of an advance team already in
Skopje, capital of Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
"It will take (Canada's commitment) up to somewhere between 750
and 800 Canadian Forces members," Henault said.
</P>
<P>
About 16,000 NATO troops are currently in Macedonia preparing
to cross the border into Kosovo for peace-keeping duties.
</P>
<P>
Canadian Defense Minister Art Eggleton said last Friday that
Ottawa was still considering whether to send more troops to the
Balkans.

<HEADLINE> Polls in Indonesia's Aceh to Go Ahead As Scheduled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, June 6 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's General Election
Commission (KPU) said Sunday that elections will take place on
Monday for the whole of Indonesia, including the troubled Aceh
province.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made after a five-hour meeting beginning
Saturday night, KPU Chairman Rudini said early Sunday morning.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Armed Forces chief Gen. Wiranto said voting in the
general election could be delayed in some areas in Aceh province
because of the security situation there.
</P>
<P>
Unrest has gripped three districts in Aceh, and the government
and election organizations feared that a free and fair election
there could be threatened.
</P>
<P>
Rudini said if the voting in the troubled districts was
disturbed, the local election organizations should report to the
central election commission through hotline. And then the KPU
could decide on the voting postponement in the areas.
</P>
<P>
The country's 128 million eligible voters will elect 462
candidates to the 500-seat House of Representatives (Parliament)
on Monday's general election. The remaining 38 seats will be
reserved for the Armed Forces, which do not vote.
</P>
<P>
The National Election Committee (PPI) was confident Saturday
that polling will take place as scheduled on Monday. PPI Chairman
Jacob Tobing said materials such as ballot papers, hologram
stickers to be attached to the sheets, related forms and documents
have reached the estimated 320,000 polling stations.

<HEADLINE> Police Take Over Security in East Timor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, June 6 (Xinhua) -- East Timor police Saturday took
over security affairs in the territory from the military in a move
to create a conducive security climate ahead of the United
Nations-sponsored ballot, The Jakarta Post reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The transfer of authority was marked by the admission of 460
Mobile Brigade personnel and the withdrawal of 1,500 combat troops
from East Timor in two separate ceremonies in Dili, capital of
East Timor.
</P>
<P>
Provincial Police chief Col. Timbul Silaen, who received the
Mobile Brigade officers, said their main mission was to maintain
security, enforce the law and protect the U.N. Assistance Mission
in East Timor (UNAMET), who are in the territory to help organize
the ballot.
</P>
<P>
"With the new authority, the police are expected to take charge
of stopping crimes, the illegal possession of guns, violence and
intimidation against local people. We are present here (East
Timor) to ensure the legal certainty (of the ballot) and to create
a feeling of safety among the people," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said 3,900 security personnel from the provincial police
force had been deployed to eight regencies to maintain security
ahead of the Indonesian general election on Monday until the
August 8 ballot. The August 8 ballot will determine whether the
East Timorese accept an autonomy package or establish an
independent nation.
</P>
<P>
The Mobile Brigade personnel, who arrived in Dili on Saturday,
will be deployed to three other regencies. Approximately 4,000
more Mobile Brigade personnel are scheduled to arrive in the near
future to help protect the U.N. mission.
</P>
<P>
Under an agreement signed by Indonesia and Portugal on May 5,
the U.N. will deploy civilian police advisers from several
countries to assist Indonesian police in maintaining law and
order. A key function will be the disarmament of rival factions
that are either for or against independence.
</P>
<P>
Since January, dozens of East Timorese have been killed in
clashes between the warring factions.
</P>
<P>
The former Portuguese colony of East Timor was integrated into
Indonesia in 1976 in a move never recognized by the U.N., which
still considers Portugal as the administering power of the
territory.
</P>
<P>
The August 8 ballot will allow the territory's people to choose
whether their homeland should become an autonomous region within
Indonesia or totally independent.

<HEADLINE> Volvo to Set up Heavy Truck Joint Venture in Jinan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 6 (Xinhua) -- The Volvo Truck Corp is to
establish a 576 million U.S. dollar joint venture with the China
National Heavy Truck Corp in Jinan, capital of east China's
Shandong Province, the Business Weekly reported today.
</P>
<P>
The joint venture plans to develop, manufacture and distribute
Volvo heavy trucks in China.
</P>
<P>
According to Xu Rengen, chairman and president of China
National Heavy Truck Corp, the project is supported by the central
government and preparation work is well under way.
</P>
<P>
The report also quoted Leif Johansson, president and chief
executive officer of the Sweden-based Volvo Group, as saying that
China is recognized as a markt of strategic importance for Volvo.
</P>
<P>
"China's massive investment in infrastructure construction is
very impressive," said Jan Van Setten, general project manager of
the Jinan Truck Joint Venture Project.
</P>
<P>
He forecast that the demand for heavy trucks in China would
grow quickly.
</P>
<P>
According to a research conducted by China National Heavy Truck
Corp, the benefits trucking companies could gain from China's
reform depend primarily on the efficiency of their vehicles and
making up-to-date vehicles more attractive.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, cheaper diesel and less tax in comparison with
gasoline would also boost the use of heavy trucks if the fuel tax
were imposed.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam to Attract More Foreign Investment in Agriculture </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, June 6 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam will take measures to attract
more foreign investment in its agricultural and forestry
production and fisheries, a Vietnamese agricultural official said
recently.
</P>
<P>
As many as 13 foreign direct investment (FDI) projects worth
almost 36 million U.S. dollars were granted licenses in
agricultural and forestry production and fisheries in the first
five months of 1999, Vietnam News Agency reported Saturday,
quoting the Ministry of Planning and Investment.
</P>
<P>
That figure brings the number of FDI projects to 200 in
agricultural production, 130 in agro-forestry product processing
and 40 in irrigation.
</P>
<P>
China's Taiwan, South Korea, Japan and France are major
investors in these sectors.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the number of FDI projects in these sectors
accounts for only 11 percent of the total number of Vietnam's FDI
projects and about 5 percent of the total FDI capital in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam's Deputy Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development
(MARD) Nguyen Thien Luan said that investment in agricultural and
forestry production, irrigation and fisheries involves high risks
and takes a long time to yield profit. In addition, investors have
to face difficulties resulting from Vietnam's poor infrastructural
facilities and incomplete laws.
</P>
<P>
He said his ministry would continue taking measures to attract
more foreign investment in this area. It will re-arrange
management agencies, reform administrative procedures and organize
training courses for project management officials.
</P>
<P>
He said the government is encouraging domestic and foreign
investment in development of plant and animal strains, plant
protection, irrigation and forest plantation.
</P>
<P>
According to official figures, more than 3 billion U.S. dollars
coming from official development assistance (ODA) sources has
already been invested in Vietnam's 64 forestry projects, 25
irrigation projects and 51 agricultural projects.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development is calling
for ODA investment in 10 major projects on forest plantation,
irrigation, sericulture development, resettlement, and
construction of new economic zones.

<HEADLINE> Traffic Accidents Rank as World's No.1 Killer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 6 (Xinhua) -- Traffic accidents have claimed 32
million lives around the world since the late 19th century,
outnumbering war deaths and ranking as "the No.1 public threat to
human society", according to information released during a recent
international symposium held in the Chinese capital.
</P>
<P>
Worldwide traffic accidents kill one person every 50 seconds
and injure one person every two seconds. Over one million people
die in traffic accidents each year, according to statistics
presented at the 16th International Symposium on Traffic Accidents
and Medical Aids.
</P>
<P>
Over 200,000 Chinese citizens die or are injured in traffic
injuries each year, with direct economic losses topping two
billion yuan (240 million US dollars) annually, according to a
Guangming Daily report.
</P>
<P>
A sharp increase in the number of automobiles, heavy traffic,
poor management of facilities and traffic violations have been
blamed as the leading causes contributing to the rise in accidents
in recent years, especially in developing countries.
</P>
<P>
Participants in the symposium agreed that effective measures
for reducing traffic accidents should include strengthening
publicity related to traffic safety, strengthening regulations,
and improving road conditions and the quality of drivers.
</P>
<P>
Chinese experts suggested the establishment of national data
bases listing casualties resulting from traffic accidents, and
improving first aid networks across the country in a bid to reduce
the mortality rate.
</P>
<P>
The four-day symposium, the first international event of its
kind held in China, attracted 300 experts from 35 countries.

<TEXT>
<P>
SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, June 5 (Xinhua) -- Colombia's National
Liberation Army (ELN)Saturday released five people kidnapped last
week.
</P>
<P>
The report, broadcast by the Caracol radio and television
network, said that the five people delivered to a commission
appointed by the International Red Cross Committee, are three men
and two women.
</P>
<P>
People's Advocate Jose Fernando Castro Caycedo said the release
of the other hostages who still are in the hands of the second
most important guerrilla of the country, has become more
complicated.
</P>
<P>
The guerrillas said, according to the reports, that there will
be no more releases if the military forces are not withdrawn from
three Jamundi zones.
</P>
<P>
The army suspended this morning military operations in the
zones that surround the Jamundi municipality, on orders of
President Andres Pastrana, to make easier the delivery of persons
retained by the ELN.
</P>
<P>
Last Sunday, May 31, the ELN entered a church and kidnapped
more than one hundred people, 90 of them still in their hands.

<HEADLINE> London Protesters Condemn NATO Bombing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 5 (Xinhua) -- Thousands of protesters on Saturday
attended rallies in London to protest against NATO's bombing
campaign in Serbia.
</P>
<P>
The anti-war protesters gathered at Victoria Embankment in the
afternoon and marched through Central London to the Imperial War
Museum in Kennington, south London.
</P>
<P>
They demand an immediate halt to NATO bombing of Yugoslavia to
allow the peace settlement to proceed.
</P>
<P>
The march and rally, which is the third national protest in
Britain organized by the Committee for Peace in the Balkans and
supported by the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, lasted for
about one and a half hours.
</P>
<P>
In a speech to around 4,000 people gathered outside the
Imperial War Museum, Parliamentary Member (MP) Alice Mahon,
chairman of the Committee for Peace in the Balkans, urged NATO to
stop bombing "in order to allow peace discussions to proceed."
</P>
<P>
Playwright Harold Pinter also addressed at the protest. He
described the current peace talks as a "sham."
</P>
<P>
"In my view, it has been a totally unwarranted war. In the
first place, it's immoral because it's entirely outside the
perimeters of international law - committing thousands of
atrocities," he said.
</P>
<P>
"I think this peace isn't really peace at all," the playwright
said.
</P>
<P>
Pinter, who was cheered as he took the platform, said the
bombing had made him feel a sense of "shame of being British."
</P>
<P>
Police estimated that around 3,700 people took part in the
march from Victoria Embankment to the museum.
</P>
<P>
The event, organized before the peace talks began in Kosovo,
was mirrored by a similar rally in Glasgow, attended by around 500
protesters.

<HEADLINE> China Planning Gold Price Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 6 (Xinhua) -- Plans are being drawn up to reform
China's pricing system for its gold products to keep pace with
changes in the world market.
</P>
<P>
The aim is to keep prices in line with the world gold market
which will improve competition and encourage innovation and
creativity in design, according to a source at the State
Development Planning Commission.
</P>
<P>
The reform measures include: changes in retail and wholesale
prices based on fluctuations in the world market; separating
actual prices from processing fees; altering procedures for
setting prices in ratio to weight; and reducing taxes in a bid to
lighten the financial burdens on relevant producers.
</P>
<P>
China's authorities have long exercised tight control over gold
products, resulting in price differences between the domestic and
global markets.
</P>
<P>
Prices of gold ornaments in China's mainland areas are 20 to 35
yuan higher per gram on average than those in Hong Kong Taiwan,
Thailand, and Singapore.
</P>
<P>
In addition, taxes paid by China's gold enterprises are higher
than those in other southeast Asian nations and regions, with the
value added tax rate and consumer tax rate standing at 17 percent
and 5 percent, respectively. In contrast the Republic of Korea and
Thailand have a value added tax levy of 10 percent, and Singapore
charges only 3 percent consumer tax.
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics China used approximately 192
tons of gold in 1998, making it the fourth largest gold market in
the world as well as number one in the Far East.
</P>
<P>
China now has 340 gold ornaments manufacturing and wholesale
firms, and more than 10,000 retail sales outlets, which use over
200 tons of gold annually resulting in 30 billion yuan worth of
business volume.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam Promotes Aquatic Produce Export </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, June 6 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam's fishery sector exported
82,350 tons of aquatic products in the first five months of this
year, earning 324 million U.S. dollars and fulfilling 34 percent
of the annual target.
</P>
<P>
The exports included nearly 28,000 tons of frozen shrimp,
nearly 6,700 tons of frozen cuttlefish, 24,200 tons of fish and
2,760 tons of cuttlefish, according to a report of Vietnam News
Agency on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
With the recent exchange of Most Favored Nation (MFN) status
between Vietnam and Japan, Vietnam's shrimp exports to the
Japanese market are subject to a tariff rate of only one percent
from four percent previously.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the Vietnamese government's approval of a master
plan to develop the fishery sector by 2005 has served as a
catalyst for local aquatic produce exporters to expand their
business.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam's Ministry of Fisheries has instructed localities to
expand and upgrade the network of aquatic produce processing
factories and invest in aquaculture.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam has been conducting negotiations with the EU and South
Korea on exports of its aquatic produce to these markets.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Aerospace Firm Stresses Foreign Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 6 (Xinhua) -- A leading aerospace enterprise in
south China has decided to expand its cooperation with foreign
partners in the fields of electrical appliances and other civilian
products, according to today's China Daily Business Weekly.
</P>
<P>
"The introduction of (foreign) equipment and technology has
played an important role in China's economic development," Xie
Guang, general manager of the Guilin-based G &AMP; A Technologies Inc.
in the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The company is now cooperating with a French firm to produce
civilian-use elevators, a project in which the two companies have
to date invested more than 500,000 US dollars, Xie told the
English newspaper.
</P>
<P>
The largest producer of relays used in space flight in China,
the G &AMP; A Technologies Inc. supplies 95 percent of rocket-used
relays and 100 percent of satellite-used couplers needed in the
country's space industry.
</P>
<P>
"The company's major products such as relays and couplers have
reached the internationally advanced level," said Xie.
</P>
<P>
However, some developed countries have erected barriers to his
company's cooperation with its foreign counterparts, noted Xie.
</P>
<P>
For example, he said, his company recently signed a contract
with a US firm to import equipment worth 400,000 US dollars. But
the US firm broke the agreement, possibly because of political
reasons.

<HEADLINE> Gotti Leads Overall Standings at Tour of Italy Cycling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, June 5 (Xinhua) -- Ivan Gotti took the lead of the
overall standings in the 21st stage in Aprica on Saturday after
Marco Pantani was expelled before the start because of a failed
doping test.
</P>
<P>
Spain's Roberto Henandez Heras took the 21st and penultimate
stage, winning in five hours 57 minutes and 7 seconds, but Gotti
claimed the lead when his Italian countryman and overall leader
was barred from starting for having an unusually high red cell
count in a blood test conducted at dawn by International Cycling
Union (UCI).
</P>
<P>
Heras, of the Kelme team, won the three-way sprint at the
finish in this Alpine resort, beating Italy's Gilberto Simoni and
Gotti.
</P>
<P>
In third place, Gotti trailed Pantani by more than six minutes
before his countryman was expelled. Italy's Paolo Savoldelli, who
was in second after Friday's 20th stage more than 5 1-2 minutes
behind Pantani and more than half a minute ahead of Gotti.
</P>
<P>
He finished fourth Saturday, 4:05 behind the lead trio that
included Gotti.
</P>
<P>
Gotti, the best Giro climber in Pantani's absence, launched a
decisive attack along with Heras and Simoni as the road climbed to
Mortirolo, the third of the four Alpine passes in Saturday's stage.
</P>
<P>
French national champion Laurent Jalabert placed fifth in
Saturday's stage, 4:45 behind Heras, but held fourth place overall,
5:16 from Gotti.
</P>
<P>
Gotti, of the Team Polti, will take a lead of more than 3 1-2
minutes over Savoldelli and Simoni into Sunday's last stage, a 170-
kilometer flat ride from Boario Terme to Milan.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Plans To Meet State Environmental Standards By 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, June 6 (Xinhua) -- All 3,702 polluting companies in
Shanghai will have to meet state environmental protection
standards by Sept. 30 of next year and air and water quality in
all its districts will have to meet state standards by the end of
next year.
</P>
<P>
According to Lu Shuping, the head of Shanghai Environmental
Protection Bureau, by the end of last year, 87 percent of the
city's enterprises had met state environmental control
requirements and industrial pollution in the city was effectively
under control.
</P>
<P>
However, Shanghai still has 176 major polluters that have not
developed proper measures and environmental protection authorities
say they will close those that fail to meet standards by the
deadline.

<HEADLINE> De La Hoya Wants More Money to Fight Trinidad </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 5 (Xinhua) -- Oscar De La Hoya wants double
the proposed $15 million purse to fight against Felix Trinidad in
a welterweight reunification fight.
</P>
<P>
According to a press report here today, De La Hoya won't agree
to fight Trinidad for the $15 million that he has been offered.
</P>
<P>
"Oscar not only has not signed the contract but also will not
accept the offered purse of $15 million to fight Trinidad," said
Roberto Alcazar, De La Hoya's trainer, in a telephone interview
from Los Angeles Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Alcazar said De La Hoya, the WBC champion, was discussing
getting double that amount with his promoter, Bob Arum.
</P>
<P>
The $15 million figure came from Arum, who is arranging the
September 18 bout in Las Vegas. De La Hoya was paid $5 million for
his last bout, when he defended his title against Oba Carr in Las
Vegas two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
Trinidad is undefeated in 35 fights with 30 knockouts and for
years has sought an opportunity to challenge De La Hoya, who is
considered the top welterweight in the world. De La Hoya has won
all 31 of his fights, with 22 knockouts.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Waits for New Dates for Talks With India: FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, June 6 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Foreign Minister Sartaj
Aziz said late Saturday that his country will wait for the new
dates to be proposed by India for his visit to New Delhi.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan had proposed Aziz visit India on for talks with his
Indian counterpart Jaswant Singh to find ways to defuse the
tension in Kashmir, but an India government statement said
Saturday that the date is "not convenient."
</P>
<P>
"The meeting (between the foreign ministers) can take place
only after the two sides agree on dates convenient to both of
them," the Associated Press of Pakistan (APP) quoted Aziz as
saying.
</P>
<P>
When asked whether India was trying to wriggle out of talks,
Aziz said, "They have stated that dates are not convenient to
them. We will wait for the new dates."
</P>
<P>
An Indian Foreign Ministry official in New Delhi said his
government will revert shortly to Pakistan with alternative dates
for the proposed talks.

Ackerman said. "We've found we have a very different fan base than

The league drew averaged crowds of 10,000 fans per game last

This season, all the top talent players will play in WNBA. The

<HEADLINE> England Held 0-0 by Sweden </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 5 (Xinhua) -- Paul Scholes became the first
England player to be sent off at Wembley as England's realistic
chance of automatic qualification for Euro 2000 crumbled away
after a goalless draw with Sweden here Saturday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The Manchester United midfielder was given his marching orders
early in the second half for a second bookable offense.
</P>
<P>
But in truth it was the third bad challenge he had made after
getting away with a horror tackle in the first minute of the game.
</P>
<P>
The three tackles followed his three goals in England's last
qualifier in coach Kevin Keegan's first game in charge against
Poland.
</P>
<P>
The result itself gives Sweden a massive lead in the group and
leaves England to battle with Poland for second place and a
probable play-off for the right to play in next year's tournament.
</P>
<P>
A minute's silence was held before the start following the
recent death of 1966 World Cup winner Sir Alf Ramsey although it
was less than immaculately observed.
</P>
<P>
The game began in fiery circumstances with Swede Hakan Mild's
match ended by a violent challenge from Scholes.
</P>
<P>
He was fortunate not to be booked at this early stage, for a
tackle which left Mild nursing a nasty-looking gash on his thigh.
</P>
<P>
The first real chance came in the 26th minute, when Sweden's
Henrik Larsson headed wide after Fredrik Ljungberg's left wing
cross found the Celtic striker unmarked.
</P>
<P>
Two minutes later Scholes received the booking he had deserved
to get earlier in the half, a card which already meant he would
miss the next qualifier in Bulgaria on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
After half an hour Sweden started to turn up the pressure, with
a succession of dangerous set pieces, but they could not break
through despite some nervous England defending.
</P>
<P>
Martin Keown was replaced by Rio Ferdinand during the half
after the Arsenal defender pulled up with a hamstring injury.
</P>
<P>
And Alan Shearer wasted England's best chance of the half three
minutes into injury time, when he blasted over after Scholes' neat
lay off from a David Beckham cross.
</P>
<P>
The home side would have been pleased to have reached the break
level after seeing the visitors dominate the game.
</P>
<P>
Keegan brought on Sunderland's Michael Gray for his second cap
at half-time in place of Le Saux.
</P>
<P>
But after 51 minutes Scholes was dismissed for a knee-high
challenge on Stefan Schwarz, and the home side's plans were in
disarray.
</P>
<P>
Schwarz himself had been yellow carded two minutes before the
Scholes dismissal for a foul on Beckham.
</P>
<P>
David Batty did not take long to join him in the book as he
stood on Schwarz's ankle long after the ball had gone.
</P>
<P>
Despite their numerical advantage Sweden were clearly happy to
soak up what little pressure England could manage, knowing that a
draw would leave them in command of the group.
</P>
<P>
With 20 minutes to go Keegan told Robbie Fowler to strip off,
but just as he was about to come on, Beckham pulled up injured and
Ray Parlour became England's third substitution.
</P>
<P>
And despite England's greater need it was the visitors rather
than the hosts who threatened to win the match in the closing
stages.
</P>
<P>
David Seaman reacted superbly to turn a free kick from Arsenal
clubmate Fredrik Ljungberg on to the woodwork.
</P>
<P>
A Sweden goal would not have been unfair to Keegan's side, who
looked a beaten team well before they were booed off the Wembley
pitch.

<HEADLINE> Keegan's Honeymoon is Over </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 5 (Xinhua) -- England team manager Kevin Keegan
failed to hide his frustration after England's drab 0-0 draw
against Sweden at Wembley on Saturday, admitting: "I was
disappointed".
</P>
<P>
Saturday's result increases the pressure on England, who now go
into Wednesday's qualifier against Bulgaria knowing that automatic
qualification for Euro 2000 is a near impossibility.
</P>
<P>
"We didn't play well in the first half," Keegan said.
</P>
<P>
"I was disappointed and the players were frustrated. I can't
give you a reason.
</P>
<P>
"We are down but not out. We had to win today. They are there
and they will go with a chance."
</P>
<P>
Paul Scholes became the first England player to be sent off in
an international at Wembley when he was dismissed for two bookable
offenses in the 51st minute.
</P>
<P>
England captain Alan Shearer said: "It was very disappointing.
We thought we could have won the game. In the first five minutes
there was a spark about us but after that we seemed to have heavy
legs.
</P>
<P>
"At half-time we were disappointed not to have put in a better
performance. We were up against it when Scholes was sent off.
</P>
<P>
"We always faced an uphill battle when we were down to 10 men.
We kept plugging away but never really looked like scoring.
</P>
<P>
"It looks as if we are going to go to the play-offs. There are
no excuses now. We have to win games or we are in trouble," he
added,
</P>
<P>
David Beckham and Martin Keown - who both picked up injuries in
Saturday's match - are now unlikely to make the Bulgaria clash.
</P>
<P>
"David and Martin for sure will miss Bulgaria. Beckham can't be
back in three days," said Keegan.
</P>
<P>
"I said at half-time we had to pass it better and create a few
more chances. We never got chance to do that when Paul Scholes got
sent off. Then it was 'wow, is a draw the best we can hope for?'
</P>
<P>
"I think to be fair both were bookable offenses under the rules.
he referee reacted quickly to the second one, but he had to go. We
know the rules, we know if we break them what happens.

The one thing we take from the game is character.

"Realistically we are looking at the play-offs now. I might

<HEADLINE>   Liverpool to Resolve Fowler Future </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 4 (Xinhua) -- England premier league soccer club
Liverpool manager Gerard Houllier is to hold talks with striker
Robbie Fowler after a spate of reports suggesting the England man
is to leave Anfield.
</P>
<P>
Arsenal, Chelsea and even Manchester United have been linked
with Fowler, and Houllier is reported to be keen to resolve the
player's future once and for all.
</P>
<P>
"He knows he has been part of my plans and knows all that I
have done for him this season, but if he is not happy with that,
he can go," Houllier told the News of the World.
</P>
<P>
"Nobody at this club has put a gun to his head saying, 'You
have to sign a new contract'."
</P>
<P>
"I want to believe he is OK, but I know I will have to speak to
him," Houllier said.

<HEADLINE> Sweden, Norway, Italy and Czech on Edge of Final Berths </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 6 (Xinhua) -- Sweden, Norway, Italy and Czech
Republic looked assured of qualification for the finals of the
European Soccer Championships after respective qualifiers on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The Swedes drew 0-0 with 10-man England at Wembley to take
command of group five while the Czechs' 2-0 win in Estonia gave
them a massive 10 point lead in group nine.
</P>
<P>
The Czechs were given an unexpected bonus from the Faroe
Islands who scored a last minute equalizer to earn a surprise 1-1
home draw with Scotland.
</P>
<P>
Norway won 2-1 in Albania and are seven points clear in group 2
while Italy cruised past Wales 4-0 in group 1.
</P>
<P>
England produced one of their worst performances for years as
they never looked like scoring in another Wembley flop.
</P>
<P>
They were not helped by the 51st minute dismissal of Paul
Scholes for a second booking but in truth they were never able to
threaten the well-drilled visitors who hit the bar through Fredrik
Ljungberg's free kick.
</P>
<P>
Sweden now look certain qualifiers with 13 points while third-
placed England, who have eight from five matches, must win in
Bulgaria on Wednesday and then at old rivals Poland in September
to have a chance of reaching the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
The Poles beat Bulgaria 2-0 on Friday night and are second on
nine points with a game against Luxembourg to come on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Czech Republic kept up their 100 per cent record with their
sixth win - 2-0 at Estonia -- with goals from Patrik Berger and
Jan Koller.
</P>
<P>
The Czechs will qualify if they beat second-placed Scotland at
home on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Scots were stunned when Hans Frooei Hansen headed a last-
minute equalizer to earn the Faroes a shock draw.
</P>
<P>
Allan Johnston had given the visitors a deserved 1-0 lead in
the 38th minute but they then had Matt Elliott sent off for
punching an opponent.
</P>
<P>
Italy had little difficulty getting past Wales in Bologna as
Christian Vieri, Filippo Inzaghi and Paolo Maldini had them 3-0 up
by halftime.
</P>
<P>
They strolled through the second half with Enrico Chiesa
completing the rout two minutes from time.
</P>
<P>
Tore Andre Flo headed an 83rd minute goal to give Norway
victory in Albania. The win was Norway's fifth in a row and took
them to 16 points from seven games. Greece, who won 2-1 in Georgia,
have nine from six games.
</P>
<P>
In the day's another match which drew much attention, Russia
beat France 3-2 in Paris on Saturday to leave the World champions
in danger of missing out on Euro 2000 qualification.
</P>
<P>
Two goals for Alexander Panov and one from Valery Karpin five
minutes from time shattered the French who had fought back from 1-
0 down with second half goals by Emmanuel Petit and Sylvain
Wiltord.
</P>
<P>
France played some neat football and made most of the chances
but they always looked vulnerable to Russian breakaways.
</P>
<P>
Ukraine thrashed Andorra 4-0 and top group four with 14 points,
two ahead of Iceland, who beat Armenia 2-0. France are third on 11,
with Russia on nine.
</P>
<P>
France's hopes of topping the group are now likely to depend on
their trip to Ukraine in September but even second position and a
place in the play-offs is not guaranteed.
</P>
<P>
Spain had a huge win over San Marino with nine goals in a group
six qualifier.
</P>
<P>
Jose Antonio Camacho's team followed up their 9-0 demolition of
Austria and 6-0 stroll in San Marino to make it 24 goals in their
last three competitive games and take back top spot in the group
with 12 points.
</P>
<P>
Austria can regain the lead when they visit Israel on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Group seven remains tight at the top after Portugal beat
Slovakia 1-0 and Romania beat Hungary 2-0 - their first win over
their neighbors for 63 years.
</P>
<P>
Portugal have 15 points to Romania's 14 with Hungary now out of
the running on eight.
</P>
<P>
In other actions, Turkey won 4-2 in Finland, Denmark beat
Belarus 1-0, Bosnia beat Lithuania 2-0, while Macedonia and
Croatia drew 1-1. Germany beat Moldova 6-1 on Friday.

<HEADLINE> Thousands Rally in Washington Against War </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 5 (Xinhua) -- More than 10,000 protesters
rallied in Washington Saturday to demonstrate against the air
campaign of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) against
Yugoslavia, demanding leaders of the alliance be put on trial for
war crimes.
</P>
<P>
Holding different signs and posters, the protesters began to
gather on the lawn in the west of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial at
about noon time.
</P>
<P>
In front of a podium with loud speakers on both side, a sea of
protesters chanted slogans:"Abolish NATO!" "Stop the Bombing, stop
the occupation!" "Hands off Yugoslavia!" "Clinton, send your
Chelsea to fight your dirty war."
</P>
<P>
Many speakers don't believe that the agreement, which was
mapped out by the West and Russia, and accepted by Belgrade is a
peace agreement. They think the U.S. is being dragged into another
Vietnam quagmire.
</P>
<P>
NATO forces are an "army of occupation" in Yugoslavia, Sara
Flounders, a coordinator of the event, told the rally.
</P>
<P>
More than 20 peace activists addressed the audience, expressing
their anger at the U.S.-led NATO bombing of Yugoslavia and
requesting the American troops to be pulled out of the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
"President Clinton says this bombing is for a humanitarian
action. But we all know that that's a big lie. It's a war
propaganda designed to justify and conceal real objective of this
war," Rada Veselinovic said.
</P>
<P>
"The truth is that Yugoslavia is a regional power in a
strategic area that Pentagon and Wall Street corporations seek to
dominate," she told the protesters.
</P>
<P>
"We still have the chance to resist this imperialistic war. We
have the right to speak out against it. We have the power to stop
the Pentagon's unjust imperialistic war against any country in the
world and we have to use it," she declared.
</P>
<P>
Protesters then marched on to the Memorial Bridge and through
the Washington Boulevard then rallied at the east side of
Pentagon. All the traffic was blocked.
</P>
<P>
Some carried signs branding Clinton a war criminal. The other
signs read:"Clinton is lying, children are dying,"
</P>
<P>
The marchers chanted different slogans: "Jail Clinton, Jail
(Vice President Al) Gore, free information about the war," "Hey,
hey, USA, how many kids you killed today?" "Bombs, missiles we say
no, U.S. army out of Kosovo!"
</P>
<P>
In the parade, a car carries a trailer with 5,000 baby dolls,
indicating that the U.S.-led NATO is killing children every day.
</P>
<P>
At the Pentagon, former Attorney General Ramsey Clark addressed
the rally, urging NATO's abolition and an end to what he called
American warmongering.
</P>
<P>
"We've got to stop the fanning of flames of war by the U.S.,"
said Clark, who founded the International Action Center. "We've
got to abolish NATO."
</P>
<P>
The U.S.-European alliance fosters war and is "a threat to life
on Earth," Clark said.
</P>
<P>
He also urged the U.S. administration to cut its defense budget
which is increasing by 30 percent over the next years. "Stop that
budget, stop fueling the war flames."
</P>
<P>
The protest was organized by peace groups like the
International Action Center, a New York-based organization, and
Peace Action, based in Washington.

<HEADLINE>   Tour of Italy Leader Banned after Blood Tests </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, June 5 (Xinhua) -- Marco Pantani was banned from the Tour
of Italy in Madonna Di Campiglto, Italy, on Saturday, two stages
ahead for his second consecutive victory in the Giro, after
abnormal results on a dawn blood test.
</P>
<P>
The pre-race test showed an unusually high red-blood cell count,
which can signal the use of the banned growth hormone EPO.
</P>
<P>
The 29-year-old Pantani said he could not understand what had
happened.
</P>
<P>
"This morning, I had a bitter surprise, but there is something
strange in this affair," said Pantani.
</P>
<P>
The International Cycling Union maximum in the red blood cell
counts is 50. Pantani claimed his count was 46 on Friday night.
Saturday morning, it was 52, according to Italian media.
</P>
<P>
Pantani, one of the best world climbers, had almost capture the
Tour of Italy on Friday by winning his fourth stage, extending his
lead by more than 5 1-2 minutes over the closest rival, Paolo
Savoldelli. However, he was banned to start Saturday and barred
from competing for 15 days.

<HEADLINE> 1,900 British Troops Start Heading For Balkans Now </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 5 (Xinhua) -- Britain said on Saturday it was
sending 1,900 troops to the Balkans immediately to take part in a
planned Kosovo peace implementation force.
</P>
<P>
"We have some 5,500 British military personnel already in
Macedonia. A further 1,900 personnel are deploying immediately
with the first elements...departing today," Air Chief Marshal John
Day, deputy chief of defense staff told a press conference.
</P>
<P>
He said a total of 13,000 British troops would be deployed to
the Balkans in eight days' time.
</P>
<P>
Britain announced on Friday that it was preparing to send 4,000
troops to the Balkans at short notice, as part of the Yugoslavia
peace deal.
</P>
<P>
Day said some British helicopters had started leaving their
bases on Saturday and would start arriving on Sunday in Macedonia
to take part in the implementation force.
</P>
<P>
"The build-up of the United Kingdom's contribution... will be
very rapid and provide a considerable, potent and flexible
capability," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We expect to have a total of some 11,000 troops in theater on
Thursday, June 10 and some 13,000 on Sunday, June 13," said the
deputy chief of defense staff.
</P>
<P>
NATO already has some 25,000 troops in Macedonia and Albania.
Last week the alliance decided virtually to double the size of the
force which will now implement the peace deal.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Britain Foreign Secretary Robin Cook insisted that the
presence of Russian troops in a planned Kosovo peace
implementation force did not mean that the war-torn Serbian
province would be partitioned.

<HEADLINE> NATO, Yugoslav Military Talks to Continue on Sunday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, June 5 (Xinhua) -- NATO and Yugoslav military
officials decided Saturday afternoon to continue their talks on
the pullout of Serb forces from Kosovo after a one-hour break on
Saturday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The first session of their meeting, which began 11:00 a.m.
local time (1000 GMT) in a coffee house near the Blace border
crossing between Yugoslavia and Macedonia, lasted over five hours.
</P>
<P>
A NATO official in Brussels described the initial talks as
"positive and constructive."
</P>
<P>
Both sides used to the break to report to their respective
headquarters.
</P>
<P>
The talks, called to work out the details for pulling out all
Serb forces from the southern Serbian province of Yugoslavia, were
originally scheduled to start at 8:00 a.m. local time (0700 GMT)
but were postponed for three hours because the Yugoslav delegation
did not arrive on time.
</P>
<P>
They were unhappy about the venue -- the coffee house owned by
an Albanian in Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
General Svetozar Marjanovic, deputy chief of the General Staff
of the Yugoslav armed forces, also failed to turn up as the head
of the Yugoslav delegation.
</P>
<P>
No reason was given for the absence of Marjanovic, the ATA said
quoting a report from Skopje, capital of Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
Instead of Marjanovic, the Yugoslav delegation was led by
Assistant Secretary of the Interior Ministry Obrad Stefanovic and
General Blajodi Kovacevic, a member of the General Staff of the
Yugoslav armed forces.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Serb, NATO Generals Meet At Border Crossing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, June 5 (Xinhua) -- Serb and NATO generals met at a
border crossing in Blace, Macedonia, on Saturday to hammer out a
specific framework of withdrawal by Serb military forces from
Kosovo, a NATO spokesman told reporters.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was held between NATO general Michael Jackson and
two Serb military representatives, NATO spokesman Jamie Shea said.
"This is not a negotiating session, and it's not a place for
haggling or equivocation. This is not a place to discuss the size
or the positioning of the conference table, this is a place for
decision and action," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We expect the Yugoslav military representatives to accept the
terms that would be put to them by general Jackson. We expect them
to have due authority not only to agree but also to order the
immediate implementation of what is agreed," Shea said in a daily
news briefing at NATO headquarters.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated that NATO will remain fully vigilant until seeing
specific steps of the Serb withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
General Jackson will be "making it crystal clear to the two
Yugoslav military representatives what they have to do", Shea
said. "firstly they have to commit themselves and Yugoslavia to a
phased and rapid withdrawal of the Yugoslav ground forces, this
means that all personnel, all organizations with a military
capability must start to withdraw."
</P>
<P>
All military and civilian forces will be designated by Jackson.
"They will also mean that as these military and police forces
leave, they will have to stick to a firm schedule, using
designated assembly areas and designated routes, and also
designated areas that will have to be vacated."
</P>
<P>
Shea said the Yugoslav forces' withdrawal must be completed
within seven days from the entry into force of the agreement. "At
the same time, the Yugoslav military commanders must provide
general Jackson with all relevant information concerning the
location of landmines in Kosovo," he added.
</P>
<P>
The NATO spokesman said the Yugoslav side must also withdraw
air and air defense forces from Kosovo. "This means that all
aircraft, radars, surface-to-air missiles, and anti-aircraft
artillery must be removed from Kosovo to other locations beyond
the boundary between Kosovo and the rest of Yugoslavia. And these
air defense assets must be removed very quickly to allow for the
safe operation of the NATO surveillance air operations which will
verify the withdrawal of the Yugoslav forces," Shea said.
</P>
<P>
Referring to Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA), the ethnic Albanian
rebel forces or UCK, Shea said that as the Serb forces pull out
and the NATO forces move into Kosovo, NATO expects the KLA to
exercise restraint and not to attempt to take advantage of the
situation.
</P>
<P>
"We expect also the personnel and units of the Kosovo
Liberation Army to abide by the instructions" of NATO commander
Jackson.
</P>
<P>
"Most specifically, We hope that the Kosovo Liberation Army
will renounce violence, and acting conformity with the conditions
that were laid down in the peace plan," Shea said.
</P>
<P>
"We hope too the leadership of the Kosovo liberation Army will
fully cooperate with the international peace force on all issues
related to demilitarization," he added.

<HEADLINE> NATO, Yugoslav Military Talks to Continue Sunday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, June 5 (Xinhua) -- NATO and Yugoslav military officials
decided Saturday afternoon to continue their talks Sunday on the
pullout of Serb forces from Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
The first session of their meeting, which began 11:00 a.m.
local time (1000 GMT) in a coffee house near the Blace border
crossing between Yugoslavia and Macedonia, lasted over five hours.
</P>
<P>
A NATO official in Brussels described the initial talks as
"positive and constructive."
</P>
<P>
Both sides used one-hour break to report to their respective
headquarters.
</P>
<P>
The talks, which were called to work out the details for
pulling out all Serb forces from the southern Serbian province of
Yugoslavia, were originally scheduled to start at 8:00 a.m. local
time (0700 GMT) but were postponed for three hours because the
Yugoslav delegation did not arrive on time. They were unhappy
about the venue -- the coffee house owned by an Albanian in
Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
General Svetozar Marjanovic, deputy chief of the General Staff
of the Yugoslav armed forces, failed to turn up as the head of the
Yugoslav delegation.
</P>
<P>
No reason was given for the absence of Marjanovic, the ATA said
quoting a report from Skopje, capital of Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
Instead of Marjanovic, the Yugoslav delegation was led by
Assistant Secretary of the Interior Ministry Obrad Stefanovic and
General Blajodi Kovacevic, a member of the General Staff of the
Yugoslav armed forces.
</P>
<P>
The NATO side at the talks was led by British General Michael
Jackson.
</P>
<P>
NATO has said that there would be no negotiations at Saturday's
talks and all Serb troops and paramilitary forces will have to
pull out of Kosovo within seven days after an agreement on
withdrawal timetable is reached.

<HEADLINE> Disarming KLA Difficult Issue, NATO Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, June 5 (Xinhua) -- NATO military spokesman Walter
Jertz told reporters here on Saturday that disarming of the Kosovo
Liberation Army (KLA) is a difficult issue which will be discussed
soon.
</P>
<P>
Jertz said that the fighting between the KLA and the Serb
forces, especially close to the Albanian border, is still ongoing.
"The disarming of the KLA of course will be a matter which will be
discussed pretty soon, but it is a separate issue and it is a
difficult issue," he said when answering a question.
</P>
<P>
At the daily news briefing at NATO headquarters, NATO civilian
spokesman Jamie Shea said that as the Serb forces pull out and the
NATO forces move into Kosovo, NATO expects the KLA "to exercise
restraint and not to attempt to take advantage of the situation".
</P>
<P>
"We expect also the personnel and units of the Kosovo
Liberation Army to abide by the instructions" of NATO commander
Micheal Jackson, who is responsible for implementing NATO ground
forces.
</P>
<P>
"NATO forces will be operating under strict rules of engagement
and of course they will not tolerate any hindrance to their
mission or to their speedy deployment throughout Kosovo. And we
hope very much that we can count on the goodwill and the
constructive attitude that was shown by the Kosovo Albanian
community during the peace talks at Rambouillet in France," Shea
said.
</P>
<P>
"More specifically We hope that the Kosovo Liberation Army will
renounce violence, and act in conformity with the conditions that
were laid down in the peace plan," Shea said.
